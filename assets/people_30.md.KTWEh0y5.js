Comic strip Kim Seong-hwan worked for various publications during the Korean war;Comiclopedia, Kim Seong-kwan and his career flourished in the decades which followed. Kim's most notable creation was the character \\"Gobau\\", who first appeared in Dong-A Ilbo in 1955. This comic figure is old man with round eyes, big nose, mustache and with a single tuft of hair on top of his head. The adventures of this irrepressible and laconic old man appeared in 14,139 episodes across the span of 50 years. This became the longest-running Korean comic strip. Kim's sense of humor was sometimes provocative. For example, the comic strip caused an uproar when he drew prime-minister Jang Taek-sang bitten by a dog. Another time in 1958, Kim was imprisoned by Syngman Rhee's regime for a satirical comic he drew regarding the presidential Blue House, showing people carrying buckets of manure out of the building. Afterwards, Rhee's second-in-command Lee Ki-poong attempted to make peace with Kim, and requested that Kim draw Rhee's life story. However, Kim rejected that request.

Brown rice can be treated with enzymes that will cause carbohydrates to separate from proteins. The resulting protein powder is then sometimes flavored or added to smoothies or health shakes. Rice protein powder has a more distinctive taste than most other forms of protein powder. Like whey hydrolysate, this flavor is not effectively masked by most flavorings; however, the taste of rice protein is usually considered to be less unpleasant than the bitter taste of whey hydrolysate. This unique rice protein flavor may even be preferred to artificial flavorings by consumers of rice protein. Rice protein is commonly mixed with pea protein powder. Rice protein is high in the sulfur-containing amino acids, cysteine and methionine, but low in lysine. Pea protein, on the other hand, is low in cysteine and methionine but high in lysine. Thus, the combination of rice and pea protein offer a superior amino acid profile that is comparable to dairy or egg proteins, but without the potential for allergies or intestinal issues that some users have with these proteins. Moreover, the light, fluffy texture of pea protein tends to smooth out the strong, chalky flavor of rice protein.

Life The son of George Berkeley, 1st Earl of Berkeley, he was educated at Christ Church, Oxford and Trinity College, Cambridge, was created a Knight of the Bath for the coronation of Charles II in 1661, and received his Master of Arts from Oxford on 28 September 1663. On 21 November 1667, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Berkeley adopted the styling Viscount Dursley in September 1679, when his father was raised to the earldom. He had just been elected as MP for Gloucester, for which he sat in the last two Parliaments of Charles II, in 1679 and 1681. He did not stand again, in part due to conflict with the Tory corporation of the city. Dursley followed his father in opposing James II in the Glorious Revolution, and enjoyed a number of appointments thereafter. Called up to the House of Lords as Baron Berkeley in July 1689, he was then sent as Envoy Extraordinary to Spain in May 1689, and as Ambassador to the United Provinces from August 1689 to 1695. He also received the post of Custos Rotulorum of Gloucestershire, previously held by his father, in July 1689. On 3 May 1694, he was made a Privy Councillor, and on 25 May, was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Gloucestershire. In the following year, Dursley was appointed High Steward of the City of Gloucester, and Constable of St Briavel's Castle on 18 June 1697. Berkeley succeeded to the earldom in 1698, and also received his father's office of Custos Rotulorum of Surrey in February 1699. His eldest son, Charles, Viscount Dursley, died of smallpox in May, and his daughter, Lady Penelope, in September of that same year, both while Berkeley and his family were in Dublin during his tenure as one of the Lords Justices (1699‚Äì1700). On 7 June 1702, Berkeley's appointment as Constable was renewed, and he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Surrey and Warden of the Forest of Dean.

Sayyid Abd al-Malik emigrated from Hadhramaut to India in 14th century AD, earlier than other emigrations from Hadhramaut. al-Husayni later married a daughter of Nasirabad nobility and acquired \\"Azmat Khan\\" title. \\"Khan\\" title was given in order to consider him as the local nobility. In addition, they put \\"Azmat\\" which means \\"noble\\" because Abd al-Malik was originated from sayyid lineage. His descendants still retain this name as their patronymic until today.

Due to the long history of extensive intermarriage, notably with local nobility, most of them are physically and culturally indistinguishable from the local population. In Indonesia, it is not uncommon for an Azmatkhan family member to have hereditary royal title such as Raden, Tubagus, Masagus, Masayu, Kemas, or Nyimas. They maintain their Indonesian identity and Azmatkhan ancestry at the same time. Some of them, however, cannot trace their ancestry anymore. In order to record and keep genealogy of Azmatkhan family, Rabithah Azmatkhan was founded.

In Western countries extended breastfeeding usually means breastfeeding after the age of 12 or 24 months, depending on the culture.  North America  Percentage of U.S. infants breastfeeding by month since birth. Dotted line: Exclusive breastfeeding Dashed line: Any breastfeeding * Estimated at 7 days after birth Elizabeth Baldwin says in Extended Breastfeeding and the Law, \\"Because our culture tends to view the breast as sexual, it can be hard for people to realize that breastfeeding is the natural way to nurture children.\\" In Western countries such as the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, extended breastfeeding is a taboo act. It is difficult to obtain accurate information and statistics about extended breastfeeding in these countries because of the mother's embarrassment. Mothers who nurse longer than the social norm sometimes hide their practices from all but very close family members and friends. This is called \\"closet nursing\\". In the United States, breastfeeding beyond 1 year is considered extended breastfeeding, and in contrast to WHO recommendations which recommend exclusive breastfeeding until six months, and \\"continued breastfeeding up to 2 years of age or beyond\\" [with the addition of complimentary foods],https://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/exclusive_breastfeeding/en/ the American Academy of Pediatrics stated in 1997 that, \\"Breastfeeding should be continued for at least the first year of life and beyond for as long as mutually desired by mother and child\\". In the United States overall, according to a 2010 CDC \\"report card\\", 43% of babies are breastfed until 6 months and 22.4% are breastfed until 12 months, though breastfeeding rates varied among the states. Breastfeeding rates in the U.S. at 6 months rose from 34.2% in 2000 to 43.5% in 2006 and the rates at 12 months rose from 15.7% in 2000 to 22.7% in 2006. The U.S. Healthy People 2010 goals were to have at least 60% of babies exclusively breastfed at 3 months and 25% of babies exclusively breastfed at 6 months so this goal has yet to be met. There have been several cases in the United States where children have been taken away from their mother's care because the courts or government agencies found the mother's extended breastfeeding to be inappropriate. In 1992, a New York mother lost custody of her child for a year. She was still breastfeeding the child at age 3 and had reported experiences of sexual arousal while breastfeeding the child. The authorities took the child from the home in the fear that the mother might sexually abuse the child. Later, the social service agency that took over the case said that there was more to the case than could be released to the press due to confidentiality laws. In 2000, an Illinois child was removed from the mother's care after a judge ruled that the child might suffer emotional damage as a result of not being weaned. The child was later returned to the mother and the judge vacated the finding of neglect. A social service agency in Colorado removed a 5-year-old child from the mother because she was still breastfeeding, but the court ordered the child returned to its family immediately. Africa Ethiopian child breastfeeding. =Guinea-Bissau= In Guinea-Bissau, the average length of breastfeeding is 22.6 months.  Asia and Oceania  =India= In India, mothers commonly breastfed their children until 2 to 3 years of age. Cows milk is given in combination with breast milk though use of formula has been on the rise. As of November 2012, the Ministry of Women and Child Development, with UNICEF as a technical partner, have kicked off a nationwide campaign to promote exclusive breastfeeding to infants up to the age of six months - one among a series of advisories it is issuing - as part of an awareness program targeted at eradicating malnutrition in the country. Indian actor Aamir Khan serves as the brand ambassador, and has acted in numerous televised public service announcements. =Philippines= In the Philippines, the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Milk Code require that breastfeeding be encouraged for babies up to the age of 2 years old or beyond. Under the same code, it is illegal to advertise infant formula or breastmilk substitutes intended for children 24 months old and below. However, a 2008 WHO survey found that on average, mothers in the Philippines breastfed their babies until 14 months of age, with breastfeeding lasting up to 17 months on average in rural areas. Almost 58% of mothers surveyed around the nation were still breastfeeding their babies when the babies were a year old, and 34.2% of mothers were still breastfeeding when their babies were 2 years old.https://www.who.int/nutrition/databases/infantfeeding/countries/phl.pdf In 2012, it was reported that legislation had been introduced which would narrow down the application of the Milk Code (reducing the period recommending against artificial baby foods for babies from 0 to 36 months to 0 to six months only), would lift the restriction on donations of artificial milk products in emergency situations (encouraging mothers with disabilities to shift to milk substitutes instead of encouraging them to continue breastfeeding assisted by support persons), would change the legally mandated lactation break period for breastfeeding mothers from paid to unpaid status, and would remove the ban on milk companies giving away free samples of artificial milk products in the health care system.  In religion  = Islam = The central scripture of Islam, al-Quran, instructs that children be breastfed for two years from birth.The Quran, Surat al-Baqarah (the chapter of The Heifer, a.k.a. The Cow), verse 233. Islam relies on the Islamic calendar, in which \\"year\\" refers to a lunar year of 12 lunar cycles, totaling 354 days in length, potentially with the addition of 1 day for a leap year.  Psychological effects  In A Time to Wean, Katherine Dettwyler states that \\"Western, industrialized societies can compensate for some (but not all) of the immunological benefits of breastfeeding with antibiotics, vaccines and improved sanitation. But the physical, cognitive, and emotional needs of the young child persist.\\" Many children who are breast-fed into their toddler years use the milk as a comforting, bonding moment with their mothers. In a 1974 survey of 152 mothers, 17% said that the security their toddlers obtained through extended breastfeeding helped them become more independent, 14% said that extended breastfeeding created a strong mother-child bond, and 14.6% said that extended breastfeeding strengthened their abilities as a mother. Four mothers said that they felt their child was too dependent and one mother considered her child a poor eater. Dr. Stein said \\"A mother in my practice who breastfed 2 children until 2 years of age explained that she would slow down and give her undivided attention to her child several times each day when breastfeeding. Her children knew that she always had time for those moments each day. This time was also important to the mother for relaxing and unwinding.... For many nursing toddlers, the breast comes to serve the same function as a favorite blanket or stuffed animal in providing comfort and a sense of security.\\" One issue with extended breastfeeding is the ability of the mother and the child to separate. Some say that the desire for extended breastfeeding comes from the mother's inability to let go of \\"her baby\\". Baldwin refutes this statement, saying that the child is the one who chooses when they are weaned, as it is very difficult to force a child to breastfeed.  Health benefits  Longitudinal research shows breastfed toddlers aged over 12 months have fewer illnesses and lower mortality rates. Milk composition in the second year of breastfeeding contains significantly higher concentrations of lactoferrin, lysozyme, and Immunoglobulin. These have been shown to support the child's immune system's antibodies.

His first name is sometimes misspelled Mohishunder, though Mahescandra is a variant. Banerjee is a common Bengali Brahmin surname. Moheshchunder, also known as \\"the Brahmin\\", was a player from the mofussil or suburbs of Calcutta. He played traditional Indian chess, which in Bengal at the time, pawns did not have the option of moving two squares from the starting row and pawns would promote to the piece of the square reached. Also Bengal chess rules did not have castling, but an unchecked king could execute a knight's move once during a game. However, there is little difference in the middlegame and many Indian chess players were very strong tacticians. Bannerjee is likely to have transitioned to western rules after contact with Cochrane and other Europeans. Among his contributions to mainstream chess is the class of openings now called Indian Defence. Career What little is known of Moheschunder comes from articles that John Cochrane, stationed at Calcutta in the 1840s, wrote for the London chess magazines. It appears that Cochrane, who had defeated every player in England barring his prot√©g√© Howard Staunton, had been searching for some worthy opponents for some time. In the autumn of 1848, a member of the Calcutta Chess club heard of a Brahmin in a village (mofussil) who had never been beaten at chess. He found an opportunity of meeting him, played him, and lost. It was stated that the man, 'Moheschunder Bonnerjee, a Brahmin', of about 50, hardly knew the European rules of chess; yet his play was presumably under European rules. This club member brought Bannerjee back to Calcutta with him. Cochrane played him and won, but was impressed. Banerjee was engaged as \\"a paid attach√©\\" of the Chess Club, where he improved wonderfully. In the Chess Player's Chronicle for 1851 are published some games between Cochrane and Moheschunder; and \\"the Brahmin\\" figures as a player in various collections of games. The Indian Defences by P-KKt3 coupled with P-Q3, or P-QKt3 coupled with P-K3, were largely taught to European players by the example of Moheschunder and other Indians, to whom the fianchetto developments were a natural legacy from their own game. It is notable that many of Bannerjee's openings were based on single pawn moves, the \\"legacy\\" mentioned by Sergeant, as in the rules of Indian chess. Cochrane is quoted in a letter written by a member of the Calcutta Chess Club, appearing in the Chess Player's Chronicle in 1850: :The only player here who has any chance whatever with Mr Cochrane, upon even terms, is a Brahmin of the name of Moheschunder Bonnerjee. Of this worthy, Mr Cochrane has himself remarked that he possesses as great a natural talent for chess as any player he ever met with, without one single exception.Letter by a member of Calcutta Chess Club, Chess Player's Chronicle, 1850, p. 318‚Äì319 =Games= Among his recorded games is the first instance of Gruenfeld Defence, more than 60 years before Ernst Gr√ºnfeld was to launch it against Alekhine at Vienna, 1922: John Cochrane‚ÄìMoheschunder Bannerjee, May 1855 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 g6 3.Nc3 d5 4.e3 Bg7 5.Nf3 0-0 6.cxd5 Nxd5 7.Be2 Nxc3 8.bxc3 c5 9.0-0 cxd4 10.cxd4 Nc6 11.Bb2 Bg4 12.Rc1 Rc8 13.Ba3 Qa5 14.Qb3 Rfe8 15.Rc5 Qb6 16.Rb5 Qd8 17.Ng5 Bxe2 18.Nxf7 Na5 and White mates in three (19.Nh6+ double check Kh8 20.Qg8+ Rxg8 21.Nf7#).Edward Winter, Kings, Commoners and Knaves: Further Chess Explorations, Russell Enterprises, Inc., 1999, p. 141. .Cochrane‚ÄìMoheschunder Moheshchunder had a flair for dramatic play evidenced by his sacrifices in this King's Indian Defence game (a variation known today as the Four Pawns Attack): John Cochrane‚ÄìMoheschunder Bannerjee 1.e4 d6 2.d4 g6 3.c4 Bg7 4.Nc3 Nf6 5.f4 0-0 6.Nf3 Bg4 7.Bd3? e5! 8.fxe5 dxe5 9.d5 Nxe4!? 10.Nxe4 f5 11.Neg5 e4 12.Ne6 exf3! 13.Nxd8?! fxg2 14.Rg1 Bxd1 15.Ne6 Bg4 16.Nxf8 Kxf8 17.Rxg2 Nd7 18.Bf4 Nc5 19.Kd2 Rc8 20.Kc2 Bf3 21.Rf2 Nxd3 22.Kxd3 Be4+ 23.Ke3 b5 24.cxb5 Bxd5 25.Rd2 Bc4 26.Rad1 Bf6 27.Bh6+ Kg8 28.Kf4 Re8 29.b3 Bxb5 30.Rc1 Be2! 31.Re1 Re4+ 32.Kg3 Bh4+ 0‚Äì1Tim Harding, A History of The City of London Chess Magazine (Part 1). Retrieved 18 March 2009. The origin of the name \\"Indian Defence\\" Moheshchunder, like other Indian players of the time, favoured fianchettoed openings, trying to control the centre with long-distance pieces rather than occupying it with the pawns. Possibly these ideas germinated in an environment of chess rules that did not permit the initial two-square move for pawns. The theory behind these openings were developed in recorded chess history much later, but Cochrane introduced the term Indian defence for this class of openings, which has now come to cover the Nimzo-Indian and many other popular openings. Fianchettoes appear to have been a favourite style in Indian chess variants, and the Queen's Indian defence was also a frequent opening for Mir Sultan Khan, who visited England for five years and won the British Chess Championship in 1929, 1932 and 1933.

This delicate fern is commonly epiphytic and is between 5 and 25 cm in length. It is distinct, with its thin, one-celled thick, membranous leaves. It is from the family Hymenophyllaceae and is dispersed world wide. The species is dispersed highly throughout Tasmanian rainforests and in the south east of mainland Australia, (Victoria and New South Wales) with small pockets of the population seen in northern Queensland. The name Hymenophyllum comes from the Greek words hymen (membrane) and phyllon (leaf). Flabellatum comes from Latin flabellatus, meaning \\"fan-shaped\\".  Description  The filmy-fern is distinct by its thin, one cell thick, membranous fronds, that grow in moist areas. Fronds are pale yellow green, covered in yellow-brown hairs, and 5‚Äì25 cm in length. Linear with entire margins, terminal on short lateral segments, with one singular vein in lateral segment; Sori numerous and present at tips of lateral segments (see image below); indusium two lipped, slightly wider than segment; fronds usually distant and often pendant. Stomata are absent. Lamina is 2-3 pinnate, ovate to linear, and yellow green; pinnae sometimes with long terminal segments commonly referred to as \\"tailed\\", narrowly rhomboidal, to fan-shaped; stipe slender and not winged, with tuft of hairs at base; rachis bearing scattered hairs, winged towards upper parts; receptical short and enclosed.  Habitat and distribution  Hymenophyllum flabellatum showing sori at tips of lateral segments. The shiny filmy-fern is found in rainforests, forming mats on rocks and tree trunks, and even forming curtains in well-lit caves. It is highly dispersed throughout Tasmanian rainforests, and also occurs on Flinders Island, as well as in New South Wales, Victoria and some areas in northern Queensland. The species also highly dispersed throughout New Zealand. Rainforests tend to reside fairly close to coastal areas (due to the need for precipitation) and as a result the shiny filmy-fern tends to not occur inland Tasmania or mainland Australia. Hymenophyllum flabellatum growing epiphytical on a tree.  Taxonomy and evolution  The family Hymenophyllaceae is a major and successful family under the division of Pteridophytes (ferns and fern allies). It is known as the filmy fern family and is successful, with about 670-700 species named, but there is debate over the amount species defined. 131 are accepted names. The family is believed to be primitive under evolutionary terms and is divided into two genera, Hymenophyllum and Trichomanes. Groups are separated based on the gametophyte and sorus structure, particularly the structure of the indsium (membrane covering sorus) and receptacle. The family is dispersed world wide, and mostly grows in tropical regions, as well as subtropical and temperate regions in the Southern Hemisphere. Members from the genus Hymenophyllum are all small, thin and delicate. They are either epiphytic plants or rock plants, forming dense mats along rainforest floors. Generally members of this family must reside in moist conditions, and therefore tropical or rainforest regions, but few members can withstand dryer conditions, curling up and later 'reviving' when moisture becomes available.

It is located in Independence, Iowa. The original plan for patients was to relieve crowding from the hospital at Mount Pleasant and to hold alcoholics, geriatrics, drug addicts, mentally ill, and the criminally insane. It was built under the Kirkbride Plan. The hospital's many names include: The Independence Lunatic Asylum, The Independence State Asylum, The Independence Asylum for the Insane, The Iowa State Hospital for the Insane, and The Independence Mental Health Institute. There is also a labyrinth of tunnels which connect every building. Like most asylums of its time, it has had a gruesome and dark history. Remnants of this are the graveyard, hydrotherapy tubs, and lobotomy equipment. History and present state Overcrowding was quickly becoming a problem at the Mount Pleasant State Hospital. Realizing that the need for another asylum in the state of Iowa was growing at a surprising rate, the state commission quickly rallied for another hospital to be built at the city of Independence, Iowa. The architect was Stephen Vaughn Shipman who also designed the mental institution in Elgin, Illinois; Anna, Illinois; Oshkosh, Wisconsin and Mendota, Wisconsin. Like the Clarinda State Hospital, and the Cherokee State Hospital, changes have been made to the building, but the building looks much like it did in early photographs and postcards. The Independence State Hospital is now known as The Independence Mental Health Institute. It continues to serve as a psychiatric hospital with a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program as well as a training school for nurses. Although some areas of the Kirkbride are now unused, the building has been kept in good shape and has recently undergone some renovations. There is a museum in the hospital which contains relics from its older years. Tours of the institution are open to the public by appointment.

Cory Library. Mary Eliza Isabella Frere (1845‚Äì1911) (nickname May) was an English author of works regarding India. In 1868 Frere published the first English-language field-collected book of Indian storytales, Old Deccan Days. Early life Frere was born at the rectory of Bitton in Gloucestershire, England on 11 August 1845. Nicknamed May, she was the eldest of five children (the others being Catherine, Georgina, Eliza and Bartle) of Henry Bartle Frere and his wife Catherine (died 1899) who was the daughter of Lieutenant-General Sir George Arthur, 1st Baronet. Mary's father had served in the colonial administration of Bombay since 1834, and in 1862 he was appointed Governor of Bombay. The family lived in the Parish of St Mary, Wimbledon, where Mary was privately educated.Dorson, R. M. (1999). History of British folklore. Taylor and Francis. . p. 334.Rootsweb. 1871 census - Frere household in Wimbledon Published works Frere published several poems and a play. Her most popular work was Old Deccan Days; or, Hindoo Fairy Legends, Current in Southern India. Collected From Oral Tradition, printed in 1868, with illustrations by her sister Catherine Frances Frere. According to Frere's introduction, she began her collection of Indian folklore during long travels with her father. Her only female companion was a local ayah named Anna Liberata de Souza. She was a Christian descendant of the Lingaet caste from the Mahratta country. What started as an idle conversation evolved into a thorough recording and study of Indian culture. German orientologist Max M√ºller reviewed Frere's collection and wrote that her rendition of Sanskrit originals read like a direct translation of ancient Sanskrit. Frere's father assisted with the editing of the work and wrote an introduction to the first edition of Old Deccan Days.Dorson, p. 335. The extensive background and 'Narrator's Narrative' supplied in the work is unusual for the period, placing the tales in the context of the difficult life of the teller. The book was a success; by the time of the third English edition (1881) it was printed in German, Hungarian, Danish, Marathi, Hindi and Gujarati languages. The book was republished with an introduction by Kirin Narayan in 2002. In the introduction to his 1892 Indian volume of fairy tales, Joseph Jacobs reprinted and acknowledged Frere's contribution to these: > Though Indian fairy tales are the earliest in existence, yet they are also > from another point of view the youngest. For it is only about twenty-five > years ago that Miss Frere began the modern collection of Indian folk-tales > with her charming \\"Old Deccan Days\\". Catherine edited The Cookery Book of Lady Clark of Tillypronie, helping to publish it in 1909 after Lady Clark's death at her husband Sir John Forbes Clark's invitation. The work was praised by the novelist Virginia Woolf and the cookery writer Elizabeth David. Death and commemoration Frere died in Sussex on 26 March 1911. She is buried at Brookwood cemetery.

Culminating at , above sea level, it is an old mountainous section of the Furka Oberalp Bahn (FO) that was abandoned after the construction of the Furka Tunnel. It has been gradually brought back into service by the Verein Furka-Bergstrecke with the use of only steam locomotives, with the entire line completed in 2010. The Furka Railway is the second highest rail crossing in Europe, after the Bernina Railway. The Uri side of the line also constitutes the highest railway in Central Switzerland. At the Steinstafel bridge Rotary snowplow at the Steffenbach bridge The section of line was always a severe operational difficulty for the FO as its high altitude rendered it impassable due to snow and ice for much of the winter season, hence it being abandoned and a tunnel constructed. This has remained a headache for the DFB, as every year it must be closed down and then reopened, an expensive process which involves the removal and replacement of a specially folding transportable bridge that would otherwise be damaged by the snow every year. The rebuilding of the line has also not been without new difficulties. Requiring to cross a busy main road on a rack operated section, the rack over the road is retractable, actuated to raise at the same time as the level crossing barriers by radios fitted to the line's locomotives. Another section, running through a forested nature reserve, has had to be fitted with a sprinkler system that operates before and after trains pass, again actuated by the radios aboard. Relays allow the system to cascade up or down the section in line with the train, to save water which is supplied by natural water supplies near the summit of the line.  Current and future plans  Gletsch railway station The organisation is currently restoring 2 HG 4/4 \\"D\\" Steam Locomotives. These 0-8-0 locos were built in Switzerland for use in Vietnam, and were repatriated along with locomotives from the Furka Oberalp Bahn that had been exported to Vietnam after their use in Switzerland. The organisation is currently endeavouring to raise approximately Swiss Fr. 1,700,000, or 1,200,000 Euro or 1,200,000 US Dollars for the work required. The test runs of one of the locomotives are planned for 2013, to assess their suitability for the Furka line. The cost of a new firebox, one of the components the HG 4/4s require, is about Swiss Fr. 110,000, or 80,000 Euro. Another current project is the restoration of a steam-powered rotary snowplough to deal with the heavy snowfall that needs to be cleared from the route before services can commence each year. This may provide a lucrative opportunity as photographers and film-makers from across Europe and the world will be keen to capture such clearances on camera. The fundraising foundation Stiftung Furka - Bergstrecke (Furka Mountain Line Foundation), which is separate to the operating company, is providing for the reconstruction of the 2 HG 4/4 locomotives and to develop the line's depot at Realp. The foundation provides investment for equipment and construction on the line generally.

He was credited with nine confirmed aerial victories. He was also noted for the audacity of his trench strafing missions-an early form of close air support. He returned to service for the Second World War, serving until the war's end. Early service and award of the Military Cross Long was the son of Major General Sidney Selden Long. He was educated at the United Services College at Windsor. He was originally commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Durham Light Infantry before being seconded to the Royal Flying CorpsGuttman & Dempsey (2007), p.45. in 1914. He was awarded Royal Aero Club Aviators' Certificate No. 1046 on 25 January 1915 after soloing a Maurice Farman biplane at the Military School, Brooklands, and was appointed a flying officer on 26 March. Even before scoring an aerial victory, he won the Military Cross, which was gazetted on 29 October 1915. His citation tells the tale: :Second Lieutenant Selden Herbert Long, The Durham Light Infantry and Royal Flying Corps. ::\\"For conspicuous gallantry on several occasions, notably the following: ::\\"On 10 September 1915, he went out to attack an observation balloon shed with a 100-lb. bomb, but, being heavily fired at by an anti-aircraft battery, he silenced the guns with this bomb and returned for another one, with which he attacked the balloon. He only narrowly missed it as it was being deflated beside the shed. ::\\"On 23 September he made two determined attacks on trains from 500 feet, breaking the rails in two places. On the first occasion he returned to the attack three times, and finally climbed to 1,000 feet in order to make better use of his bomb sight; on the second occasion he made most of his return journey at 1,000 feet in order better to examine villages, roads, etc. ::\\"On 25 September he attacked a train at 500 feet under heavy rifle fire, and damaged the line. Late in the afternoon of 25 September he heard that trains were moving at 25 miles distance, and, in spite of darkness and bad weather, he volunteered to attack them. Heavy rain prevented his reaching them, so he turned to attack Peronne station, descending to 500 feet and coming under heavy anti-aircraft gun fire. This fire prevented his reaching the station, but he climbed to 1,500 feet and attacked a \\"Rocket\\" battery, silencing one of its guns.\\" By December 1915, Long was back in England, serving as an instructor, based in Erdington. Aerial victories Long was appointed a flight commander with the rank of temporary captain on 1 February 1916. It was almost six months before Long had his first aerial win, using one of No. 29 Squadron's DH.2s to drive a Fokker Eindekker down out of control on 6 August 1916. Three months later, on 16 November, flying a DH.2 for No. 24 Squadron, he captured a Roland C.II at Beaulencourt. There followed a string of four victories in December; on the 11th, teamed with Eric Pashley, Chester Stairs Duffus and another pilot, he destroyed an Albatros D.I; on the 20th, he and Kelvin Crawford set an Albatros D.II aflame; the 26th and 27th saw \\"out of control\\" victories. On 25 January 1917, Long torched an LVG two-seater from FA(A) 216; its crew, Leutnants Gunter Kallenbach and Ernst Erdmann, leapt to their deaths. Two days later, the two-seater falling before Long's guns belonged to FA(A) 233, and the men killed were Vizefeldwebel Willy Lang and Leutnant Kurt Brandt. Long scored once more, on 6 March 1917.Guttman & Dempsey (2007), pp.45 & 51. Six days later, Long was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. His citation read: :Lieutenant (Temporary Captain) Selden Herbert Long, MC, Durham Light Infantry and Royal Flying Corps. ::For great skill and daring in piloting his machine. He shot down an enemy machine, which fell in our lines, and the same day he forced another hostile machine to land in the enemy's lines. Later, he shot down another enemy machine, which fell in our lines. He was also mentioned in dispatches five times. Long returned to England as a squadron commander in early 1917, but took a demotion to return to combat duty as a flight commander on 5 July. He later rose to acting command of that squadron, No. 46 Squadron RFC, in August.Shores, et al, p. 243. On 15 September 1918, Long was appointed an acting-major. He had a short posting with a training squadron, No. 28 Squadron RFC. Then he was transferred to the Middle East to command No. 111 Squadron RFC. Post First World War After the war's end, Long stayed in to fly Sopwith Pups in No. 46 Squadron. He then moved on to command No. 111 Squadron in the Middle East. On 31 July 1919, Long resigned his RAF commission, and was granted the rank of major. His book of memoirs, In the Blue, was published in 1920. He remained a reserve officer in the Durham Light Infantry until 10 May 1924. In March 1937, he married Marion Beatrice Smith, the ex-wife of William Lever, 2nd Viscount Leverhulme. Long returned to military service in the Administrative and Special Duties Branch of the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve during the Second World War. He was promoted from squadron leader to wing commander on 15 September 1942, relinquishing his commission \\"on cessation of duty\\" on 10 September 1945.

It is based on the popular song Little Annie Rooney and uses it in the soundtrack. The chorus: : She's my sweetheart, I'm her beau; : She's my Annie, I'm her Joe, : Soon we'll marry, never to part, : Little Annie Rooney is my sweetheart! Other tunes used in the soundtrack (as instrumentals) include \\"Yes Sir, That's My Baby\\" and \\"Baby's Birthday Party\\". Synopsis The Screen Song starts with the theme of Little Annie Rooney. She returns home to a surprise birthday party. She replies \\"I'm so Happy\\", which is similar to Betty Boop's Birthday Party. Annie has a sweetheart, Bimbo, and they both perform the title song. After the cartoon story, the bouncing ball sing-along segment begins. The background image for the first part of the sing-along is a design of shamrocks and smoking pipes, to indicate an Irish theme. In the second segment the background image is a statuette of Betty Boop. The third segment returns to cartoon animation interacting with the lyrics in the Fleischer Studios style of the time. At the end Bimbo and Little Annie Rooney are married in a church, then the final part of the chorus is sung by the faces of babies who quickly age to adult men then old men, with the lyrics \\"Little Annie Rooney, is our grand-ma\\", an indication that the pop- song which debuted over 40 years earlier was an old standard familiar to generations.

They are in two blocks of three cottages each, located on the north side of Welsh Row at numbers 118‚Äì128 (at ). The present buildings, which are listed at grade II, were erected in 1870 by John Tollemache (later created first Baron Tollemache) to replace adjacent almshouses founded by Sir Roger Wilbraham in 1613. The almshouses were modernised in 1980 and remain in residential use. The Hospital of St Lawrence, a medieval house for lepers, was possibly on or near the site of the present almshouses. Nikolaus Pevsner considers Welsh Row \\"the best street of Nantwich\\".Pevsner, p. 289 The street has many listed buildings and is known for its mixture of architectural styles,Bavington et al., plate 55 including timber-framed black-and-white cottages such as the Wilbraham's and Widows' Almshouses, Georgian town houses such as Townwell House and number 83, and Victorian buildings such as the former Grammar School, Primitive Methodist Chapel and Savings Bank. Hospital of St Lawrence The Tollemache Almshouses might be located on or near the site of the Hospital of St Lawrence, a medieval house for lepers whose date of foundation is unknown; it became a hospital for the infirm poor in around 1348. The hospital is known to have been situated well outside the medieval town of Nantwich within the parish of Acton, by the western entrance to the town on what is now Welsh Row. Although associated with an area adjacent to the old almshouses by Joseph Partridge, author of the first history of Nantwich, there is little or no direct evidence as to its precise location.Hall, pp. 53‚Äì54Lamberton & Gray, p. 12Garton 1972, pp. 8‚Äì9Garton 1983, p. 13 Wilbraham's Almshouses Wilbraham's Almshouses In 1613, Sir Roger Wilbraham of Dorfold Hall founded almshouses for six poor men at what was then the end of Welsh Row (later The Maltkilns at numbers 112‚Äì116); they were the town's earliest almshouses.Hall, pp. 249, 358, 379 Wilbraham's Almshouses were maintained by the Wilbraham family until 1692, when responsibility for them passed into the Tollemache family because of the earlier marriage of Grace Wilbraham, the Wilbraham heiress, to Lionel Tollemache, the third Earl of Dysart.Blacklay, pp. 33‚Äì35Hall, p. 21 History of present almshouses The present almshouses were built in 1870 by John Tollemache, a descendant of Sir Roger Wilbraham, to replace the Wilbraham's Almshouses which stood adjacent. Tollemache, of Peckforton Castle and Helmingham Hall, Suffolk, served successively as the Member of Parliament for South and West Cheshire, and was created the first Baron Tollemache in 1876. He was the largest landowner in Cheshire; in addition to the almshouses, he built more than fifty farmhouses and many cottages, and also donated the land for the Nantwich Market Hall. The Tollemache Almshouses stand immediately adjacent to the Wilbraham's Almshouses, and were built on their gardens, at what was then the end of Welsh Row. Like the earlier almshouses, they accommodated six men; four were from Nantwich and two from the neighbouring village of Acton.Kelly's Directory (1892) In the 1880s, the inhabitants were old married men; their widows were allowed to remain provided that they \\"conduct themselves properly.\\" Historian James Hall describes the almshouses at that time as \\"comfortable dwellings of two stories, with their gardens in front\\" which were \\"an ornament to the west end of the town\\". In 1892, the total annual endowment of the original charity was ¬£12. The almsmen each received 10 shillings quarterly, a pair of shoes annually and ¬£1 4s 6d every two years for other clothing from the Tollemache family. Additionally, increases in the original endowment by bequests from Peter Sprout and from Elizabeth and Mary Bennion, respectively, resulted in an extra ¬£2 per head plus a share of ¬£21 10s annually. According to a scheme dated 23 June 1870, the single trustee of the Wilbraham Almshouse Charity was John Tollemache, who selected the almsmen; the Tollemache family continued to maintain the almshouses until 1978. In 1975, the almshouses were self-supporting, with a total annual income from maintenance contributions of just over ¬£700, in addition to ¬£18.30 from the Tollemache estate at Peckforton and ¬£20 from the charity established by the Bennions. (The contribution from the Peter Sprout charity had ceased before 1939.Kelly's Directory (1939)) On 21 March 1978, a few years after the death of Major John Tollemache, fourth Baron Tollemache, the administration of the Wilbraham Almshouse Charity passed to the trustees of the Almshouse Charities of Sir Edmund Wright, Crewe and Others, which maintained the Wright's, Crewe and Harriet Hope Almshouses, although the charities remained separate. The almshouses were renovated and modernised starting 3 June 1980, at a total cost of up to ¬£71,500.

The Black United Front did a lot to benefit the Black Nova Scotian community. The organization held discussions about employment, housing and educational opportunities. The group also formed its own community police force to keep hard drugs out of Halifax communities, prevent police brutality in communities of colour, and built a park for young children called the Tot-Lot. Additionally, they provided legal aid in the forms of free legal advice and discounted, even sometimes free legal service to the Black community.

We want an end to the robbery by the capitalists, of our black and oppressed communities. 4. We want decent housing, fit for the shelter of human beings. 5. We want decent education for all people and an education that teaches us our true history and role in present society. 6. We want our community to be healthy and for them use to their advantage, the free health care in this nation. 7.

In 1958, the Primary School was renamed Chio Min Chio Min Primary School A and School B. In 1964, the government issued a total of RM40,000 to build nine new classrooms. Prior to that, in South Kedah there were no Chinese secondary schools for Chinese primary school students to further their studies. Therefore, some people had set up a committee to collect donations from the public to build a new building with 30 classrooms. At that time, the school was located in the Klang Sago, Kulim, Kedah. In August 2001, Chio Min Secondary School received 1.5 million Ringgit in government funding to build a new four-storey school building which officially opened on 15 January 2002. On 25 March, the first batch of form 6 classes (university preparation class) started. In April 2002, government funding helped to construct a two-story EPU computer room; construction started on April 2002. On 9 February 2003, the Chinese Orchestra was established. In 2004 the school was equipped with more than 100 computers, including computers in conference rooms, library reference room, computer room and the Office of Academic Affairs.

Clockwise from top-left; Akito Takagi and Moritaka Mashiro with Detective Trap, Shinta Fukuda with Kiyoshi Knight, Takuro Nakai and Ko Aoki with Hideout Door. This is a list of fictional characters in the manga series Bakuman. The writer of the series, Tsugumi Ohba, developed the basic character traits while Takeshi Obata, the artist, created the visual character designs. A majority of the characters are themselves involved in the manga industry as manga artists, editors, or assistants.  Main characters  =Moritaka Mashiro= : :Played by: Takeru Satoh was once content in following the usual life of a Japanese citizen by attending a university and becoming an office worker, however he is inspired to become a manga artist like his late uncle. He has a crush on his classmate Miho Azuki that he ends up making a promise to marry her after both of them achieve their dreams. He teams up with Akito Takagi to create a manga that is worthy to be adapted into an anime. The two work under the shared pen name where he serves as the illustrator. His nickname is , which is an alternate reading of the kanji in his name. He is voiced by Jun Fukuyama in the flash web-comic. His favorite manga is Ashita no Joe. Mashiro is based on the two Bakuman authors. =Akito Takagi= : :Played by: Ryunosuke Kamiki partners with Mashiro on making manga together. He specializes in story lines, some of which are unorthodox, as well as a style known as \\"serious comedy\\", where a scene with underlying seriousness comes off with humor, writing them into their manga. The two start working under the pen name ; Takagi is sometimes called , which is an alternate spelling of his name. Prior to teaming up with Mashiro, he is a star student who attracts Aiko Iwase although the latter thought of him more as an academic rival. However, he becomes frustrated that his parents were pushing him towards becoming an office worker that he decided to do manga instead. After revealing his career aspirations, he chooses Kaya Miyoshi as his girlfriend over Iwase. He is voiced by Shinnosuke Tachibana in the flash web-comic. His favorite manga is Dragon Ball. =Miho Azuki= : :Played by: Nana Komatsu is Mashiro's love interest in the series. She aspires to become a voice actress. Her mother is the woman Mashiro's uncle fell in love with. Azuki promises to marry Mashiro after they achieve their dreams; however, they agree not to see each other until then. She picks up voice work, although her popularity comes mostly because of her looks, and not because of her poor singing. When her agent urges her to participate in a gravure idol photo book, she struggles with the idea of showing her body to the public, but with Mashiro's support, she declines the offer. She and Mashiro communicate mainly through text messages and sometimes through phone calls, but rarely meet except by chance or under special circumstances. During Mashiro's hospitalization, Miho reveals that she has liked him since the fourth grade. After Mashiro is released, they have been talking with each other much more than before. =Kaya Miyoshi= : is Azuki's best friend and Takagi's girlfriend. She has rather poor self-esteem when it comes to her looks, believing others are lying when they complement her looks. Kaya used to practice martial arts in junior high, making her stronger than most girls; she also has a temper, which only gets worse when she gets drunk. Because her friends have high aspirations, she begins to feel left out, and decides to become a cell phone novelist. For her first story, she wants to depict the romance between Mashiro and Azuki; however, Takagi ends up writing it for her. She then changes her dream to support Mashiro and Takagi, with hopes of marrying Takagi; she starts by helping them read and watch through a pile of mystery-themed books and anime. She helps out in inking the manga and generally maintaining a positive atmosphere in the studio. Mashiro and Takagi find that her optimistic presence in the studio helps cheer up what is otherwise a very stressful working environment, and feel she is part of \\"the team\\". She is the one who came up with the \\"Muto Ashirogi\\" pen name.The pen name is a combination of two phrases. \\"Ashirogi\\" is a portmanteau of Azuki, Mashiro, and Takagi, and \\"Muto\\" is a short for \\"yume o kanaeru\\" which means \\"dream coming true\\". Her favorite manga is One Piece. Supporting characters = Other manga creators = Eiji Niizuma : :Played by: Shota Sometani is a manga creator prodigy who won the Tezuka Award at age 15. He moves from Aomori to Tokyo to work on the serialization of his manga Crow on the condition that he gets the right to cancel any series in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump after becoming the magazine's most popular author. He later is drafted to illustrate Aiko Iwase's scripts in the form of +Natural, which he is able to effortlessly balance with Crow. After Crow enters its seventh year of serialization as one of Jump's flagship titles, Nizuma reveals that the series that he wants to cancel is his own, which he achieves after holding a record-breaking 20-week poll leadership, leading into the final chapter. From there, Nizuma decides to write a manga that would be \\"the number one in the world\\", and starts working on ZombieŸ≠Gun with that intent. He enjoys being immersed in his work and blasting loud music in the background. He never seems to change his clothes, which consist of a sweater and sweatpants; he may not change clothes much, or has several similar outfits. Mashiro and Takagi declare him their rival, although he is very friendly upon meeting them and states he is a fan of theirs; indeed, this admiration also fuels their mutual rivalry and determination to write ever more enjoyable works. The head editor describes the difference between Mashiro and Takagi to Nizuma is their \\"love of manga\\"; indeed, Nizuma seems to have been obsessed with drawing manga since he was six years old. Nizuma tends to act conceited because he is hailed as a genius; however, after working on Crow for quite a long time, he becomes humbler, even claiming to \\"not be good enough of a manga artist to be judging other people's work\\" when asked by his editor to judge for the Treasure magazine. Nizuma is eccentric and has a variety of odd quirks, like constantly pronouncing sound effects while he draws and speaks, working to the sound of very loud music, and appearing most of the time with drawing quills tucked into the back of his shirt's collar, resembling small wings. Despite this, he has a keen eye for truly talented manga artists just by analyzing their work, and is a good judge of character. He works under the direction of the Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump editor Yujiro Hattori and for a time with his two assistants, Shinta Fukuda and Takur≈ç Nakai. His favorite manga is Doraemon. Shinta Fukuda : :Played by: Kenta Kiritani first appears as an assistant for Eiji Nizuma. He received an honorable mention when he tried for the Tezuka Award with U-400 and also gets fifth place in the same issue of Akamaru Jump with Ashirogi's Money and Intelligence one-shot. He becomes friends with Mashiro and also competes with Ashirogi in the Gold Future Cup with his original manga Kiyoshi Knight. Fukuda then gets serialized and is an aspiring rival to Ashirogi, Nizuma, and Nakai, going on to achieve considerable popularity with his following series, the motorcycle racing-themed Road Racer Giri. Among them, he is considered to have the worst drawings, though that they often border on grotesque apparently matches his stories. He can be extremely conceited, abrasive and competitive at times, yet helps out his rivals, who are also his friends. When he heard of the rumors on the internet about Mashiro and Azuki, he went on the radio and scolded the listeners who badmouthed them. His favorite manga include romantic comedies To Love-Ru, Strawberry 100%, and I\\"s. Takuro Nakai : :Played by: Sarutoki Minagawa is a former assistant of Eiji Nizuma's. As a manga artist, he won a monthly award ten years before his introduction in the story, and has since been determined to get serialized and find a girlfriend. He is good with drawing backgrounds and angles. He originally started as an assistant for Eiji Nizuma and then turned into an assistant for K≈ç Aoki, whom he was attracted to, for Hideout Door. Once the serialization ended, he confessed his love for K≈ç but was rejected. He eventually showed up again as an assistant for Takahama, who as an assistant for Muto Ashirogi who got serialized. Eventually, when K≈ç asked him to draw for her, he told her he would, on the condition that she became his girlfriend. K≈ç slapped him and told him to never speak to her again. After Takahama's series was canceled, and being rejected by another girl who was assisting with him, he gave up and returned to his home in Akita, despite protests from K≈ç, Shinta Fukuda (who was another assistant with him for Eiji) and both Mashiro and Takagi. However he eventually comes and becomes Nanamine Toru's assistant for his work \\"What is required for a good school life\\" He is later employed as Hiramaru's assistant, being manipulated by Mr. Yoshida. His favorite manga is Kimagure Orange Road. Ko Aoki : is an aspiring female manga artist who joins Jump to work on a fantasy sh≈çnen manga. Prior to her new genre, she worked for Margaret magazine in sh≈çjo manga. She placed second in the Story King competition the year before. She is paired with Nakai for her first series, Hideout Door. Her real name is and she is a graduate student studying literature at the same university as Aiko Iwase. Her editor believes that her good looks will help her sales, however, she is distrustful of men, and regularly rejects Nakai's advances. However, she gradually opens up, and is quite warm and friendly to those she trusts. After Hideout Door is cancelled, Aoki resolves to return to sh≈çjo, although she is later convinced to stay on working for Sh≈çnen Jump. She works on the serialized series The Time of Green Leaves, and she does her own drawings with assistance from Shinta Fukuda. She and Hiramaru gradually develop a relationship, which eventually leads to them getting engaged. Her favorite manga is Kimi ni Todoke. Koji Makaino Koji Makaino is a musician who aspires to be a manga artist. His work \\"Colorfusical\\" placed second in the Tezuka Awards and is a finalist in the Gold Future Cup. He announces in the news that he is the musician \\"Koogy\\" in order to get more votes, but fails to land a series. At the Jump corporate party, he is the featured entertainer where he announces a partnership with Aoki when she considers moving to Jump Square, but this too is short-lived.  Kazuya Hiramaru  : :Played by: Hirofumi Arai is introduced as a 26-year-old manga artist who quit his office job to draw manga after he picked up Sh≈çnen Jump one day for the first time in his life and decided that drawing manga would be far less troublesome than office work. His first work, Otter No. 11 receives an honorable mention and becomes serialized around the same time as Mashiro and Takagi's work, though he has no experience or background knowledge with manga. Hiramaru is easily overwhelmed and finds it hard to deal with the stress of writing manga, having initially believed that being a manga artist would be an easy job. He sometimes hides in the other manga artists' studios. His editor manages to persuade him to continue by offering to help him get closer to K≈ç Aoki, as he is attracted to her; his attempts, however, usually end badly, but in chapter 114 he finally asks Aoki out. Due to his success, he has been called a manga genius possibly on the level of Eiji Nizuma, especially considering his inexperience and relative lack of interest in writing manga. His manga's successful stories stem from Kazuya's own negativity; if he becomes cheerier, his work suffers. Until near the end of the series Hiramaru's art was rather poor, which gave it votes from fans of comedy; however, Nakai (under Yoshida's orders) helped Hiramaru improve his drawing skills.  Aiko Iwase  : is a former classmate of Mashiro and Takagi's during junior high school, where she is known for scoring high on school rankings. She assumes she and Takagi are a couple because he took her hand and accepted her statement of inspiring each other, although Takagi assumed she meant as academic rivals. Takagi later turns her down after she states that she disapproves of his writing manga. She reappears as a student at To-Oh University along with K≈ç Aoki. Under the pen name , she writes her first novel while in University, which she expects will impress Takagi. However, Takagi's refusal to say that novels are better than manga angers Iwase, who decides to write a manga for Sh≈çnen Jack to prove her superiority. Her editor is originally Hattori, who sees her talent and believes her rivalry with Takagi will be an excellent way to spur Ashirogi for their next series. However, she is frustrated that Takagi does not return her feelings even though he admits that she is more talented than Miyoshi. After Takagi marries Miyoshi, she transfers her feelings to Hattori, who finds the relationship uncomfortable enough to bring the issue to his captain. Miura is assigned as her editor, while Hattori reassigned to Ashirogi for their upcoming series; the change angers her, especially because she feels Miura is less skilled than Hattori. Her writing and plot are praised as very well made and she is the writer of +Natural. Her favorite manga is Adolf ni Tsugu. Shoyo Takahama : is introduced as a 19-year-old rookie assistant for Ashirogi on Detective Trap. While he is initially the least social of Ashirogi's three assistants, he gradually opens up to Mashiro, and expresses that he aspires to work for Disney. He eventually gets his own series in Jump, Business Boy Kenichi with Nakai and Kato as his assistants and Gor≈ç Miura as his editor. However, the series eventually gets cancelled. Without a series of his own, Takahama returns to being Muto Ashirogi's assistant for their next series Tanto, but eventually gets another series, Seigi no Mikata (Mikata's Justice), which winds up being very successful. Both Mashiro and Takagi think highly of him and value his opinion on manga, and Takahama often expresses his frustration towards Miura when the two groups share the same editor. Ryu Shizuka is an 18-year-old newcomer manga artist who submits a manga called Shapon (The End of Japan) for an issue of Treasure. Nizuma considers him and his story to be second only to Mashiro and Takagi's manga in the same issue, stating that he was amazing and deep, and would have won if he had not been up against Muto Ashirogi. Because of the dark subject matter of his manga, he is working with a young editor named Yamahisa to make it more Jump-friendly. He has social anxiety disorder and is reluctant to talk to his editor face-to- face, instead preferring to have his meetings over the Internet. He is a recluse who has spent much of his time in his room with video games and computer since the eighth grade and is sensitive to the words of others. He starts to become more comfortable talking with Yamahisa further on in the story and Yamahisa later helps him buy his own apartment and begin conversing with people. Ryu's work eventually becomes much more lighter; he is last seen saying his next work will be one focusing on hope. His favorite manga is Level E. Shun Shiratori is one of Ashirogi's assistants when Perfect Crime Party begins publication. He comes from a very wealthy family and is somewhat sheltered, so he does not know basic things like how to run a washing machine. Shiratori is a very talented artist, though his mother disapproves of his decision to become a manga artist because she does not find is respectable. After meeting Ashirogi and their other assistants, Shiratori is encouraged to pursue his dream to become a manga artist and creates his own series, Rabuta and Peace, based on himself and his dog, Peace, with some initial help from Takagi. Thanks to the Ashirogi team and his older sister Hitomi, Shiratori stands up to his mother, who reluctantly allows Shiratori to live on his own and follow his own path. Though Rabuta and Peace is eventually cancelled, he decides to continue as a manga artist. Among the characters, he is the only one whose story is left unresolved. Toru Nanamine : is a manga artist who was inspired by the early works of Muto Ashirogi and attempts to surpass them. He is however also highly distrustful of the editor-author relationship and creates a scheme to undermine it. While Nanamine initially appears as an extremely enthusiastic individual, he is actually sly and supremely arrogant, believing that no opinion other than his own matters and angrily lashing out when his assertions do not hold true. In particular, he believes the more reader opinions one can obtain beforehand, and the more suggestions can be incorporated into the manga, the better the manga will be. As a result, he uses unscrupulous means and regards his editor, Kosugi, with great contempt. Though Nanamine is a skillful artist, the means he uses to construct his story result in an increasingly fractured plot and he is eventually forced to concede to the stronger Ashirogi team when his dwindling pool of online advisors abandon him after learning how he lied to them. He later returns using an even less ethical method of using paid advisors to create the perfect manga for himself, initially testing the system with veteran manga creators and abandoning them. The act outrages the majority of manga creators and editors; the editor in chief only allows Nanamine to submit his work when Ashirogi and other artists express the desire to defeat him in direct competition. However, Nanamine fails to obtain one of the top three spots in the rankings and is banned from Sh≈çnen Jump, as stipulated by the editor in chief; ironically, the third spot that got Nanamine out of the rankings is taken by a one-shot from Mikihiko Azuma, one of the washed-out manga artist employed and later discarded by his latter scheme. = Assistants = Naoto Ogawa : is Ashirogi's lead assistant during the serialization of Detective Trap. He is 31 years old, and has a wife and three kids. In addition to his work for Sh≈çnen Jump, he also works as an assistant for Shonen 3. While he is careful to balance his work and family life, Ogawa sincerely cares about the quality of his employer's work. After \\"Trap\\" ends, he does not return until Ashirogi decides to hire a fourth assistant for the serialization of Reversi, during which he helped Mashiro manage deadlines and brought in two extra assistants when the Ashirogi team fell behind attempting to complete three storyboards simultaneously. Natsumi Kato : is a bespectacled assistant who works for Ashirogi during the serialization of Detective Trap. She has worked a year in shonen and a year in shojo. She develops a crush on Mashiro, but gives up after meeting Azuki during Mashiro's hospitalization. After \\"Trap\\" is canceled, she becomes Takahama's assistant on Business Boy Kenichi, where she forms a friendly relationship with Nakai, until he misconstrues her amiability as romantic. She later assists Aoki on Time of Greenery, and returns to assist Ashirogi when Shun Shiratori resigns to work on his own manga series. She is friends with rookie voice actress Ririka Kitami, who is more oblivious and emotional than Kato; she often has to correct or pacify Ririka when she's thinking about something. Her favorite manga is said to be either The Rose of Versailles or Glass Mask. Ichiriki Orihara : is introduced as Ashirogi's new assistant during their serialization of Vroom! Tanto Daihatsu. Energetic, cheerful, and talkative, he is very supportive of Ashirogi and genuinely enjoys working for them. After Takagi and Mashiro choose to end \\"Tanto,\\" he agrees to work for them without pay and taking non-assistant work as a part-time job until they got a new series. Orihara remains Ashirogi's assistant during Perfect Crime Party and Reversi. Like Eiji Nizuma, Orihara is a bottomless pit, able to eat large amounts of food without suffering a stomach-ache. He also reads Tozai Sports; coincidentally, it was because of this that he was to show Mashiro and Takagi the negative take the newspaper did on the relationship between Miho and Mashiro. His favorite manga is Slam Dunk. Shuichi Moriya : is one of Ashirogi's assistants for Perfect Crime Party and Reversi. He is a year younger than Mashiro and Takagi. After he became a finalist in the Tezuka Award, he decided to drop out of design school and concentrate on manga, which he regards as an art form that deserves more respect. While he is also an aspiring manga artist with excellent drawing skills, editors have remarked that his works tend to lecture at audiences and need to be simplified. Though he did not get along with Shiratori at first because Shiratori considered manga a commercialized product, they manage to reconcile their views thanks to Mashiro. As an assistant, he is dedicated and supportive; although he dislikes Ogawa for becoming Ashirogi's head assistant during Reversi because Ogawa will leave while the other assistants stayed behind, he comes to respect Ogawa when he returns at a critical hour with two additional assistants to help meet an important deadline. One of Moriya's favorite manga appears to be Osamu Tezuka's Phoenix. Hiromi Yasuoka : is Fukuda's assistant, the only assistant that Fukuda has until the serialization of Road Racer Giri. He sports a mohawk is an avid admirer of Fukuda, often commenting about how cool Fukuda is, and Fukuda will often pay Yasuoka for any good ideas he comes up with. = Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump editors = Some of the Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump editors interact with the characters in Bakuman. They are organized in groups under deputy editors that compete against each other to select manga that are suitable finalists for their Tezuka Awards, as well as determining inclusion and serialization in their publications. Akira Hattori : :Played by: Takayuki Yamada is Mashiro and Takagi's first editor. Although he does not want the two to experience success too rapidly, he encourages them to continue making manga and accepts their works for submission to the various contests and publications in Jump. After Detective Trap becomes serialized, however, Hattori loses them to Gor≈ç Miura due to conflicting responsibilities, and soon becomes Aiko Iwase's editor. After The Perfect Crime Party is serialized, Hattori returns as Muto Ashirogi's editor, leading Miura to edit Iwase's work. He is somewhat of a schemer and likes to plot both behind other editors and even his own manga artists to advance the interests of the magazine. As such he came up with the idea of having Nizuma and Iwase collaborate on +Natural in order to inspire Mashiro and Takagi to work harder. His favorite manga is Cobra. Goro Miura : is Mashiro and Takagi's editor between the start of Detective Trap and the serialization of Perfect Crime Party. Initially he is very enthusiastic but naive and somewhat incompetent due to lack of experience. He is desperate to get one of his series serialized in order to protect his job, and believes that gag manga have a better chance of doing so. This often clashes with Mashiro and Takagi's approach, leading to some arguments. Over time, and through the tutelage of Hattori, he becomes more flexible and his personal desires do not come into play as often, and Ashirogi come to accept him as an editor. He is also the editor for Takahama's Business Boy Kenichi and Seigi no Mikata and eventually becomes Iwase's editor. His favorite manga is Jungle King Tar-chan. Hisashi Sasaki : :Played by: Lily Franky is the editor-in-chief of Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump. Earlier in his career he had worked with Moritaka's uncle as Nobuhiro Mashiro's editor. He eventually had to break the news that Nobuhiro would have to leave Sh≈çnen Jump, leading to his unemployment and eventual death. Despite his stoic and stern demeanor, he is very passionate about what he does. Sasaki also likes to delegate responsibilities when able in order to give his subordinates experience. When dealing with the manga artists, he does not hesitate to put them in their place and will resort to trickery, much like Hattori, to make them see what will happen. Sasaki later becomes the editor in chief of the fictional new monthly magazine, Hisshou Jump. The character is based on the real person of the same name who was the editor-in-chief of Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump from 2008 to 2011, coinciding with the majority of Bakumans serialization. Yoshihisa Heishi : is the Deputy Chief Editor of Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump. He has a serious personality and usually follows Sasaki's orders but does appear to have his own reservations sometimes. He is later promoted to Editor- in-Chief following Sasaki's move to Hisshou Jump. After his promotion, his personality alters somewhat; he becomes more open about his opinions, often dramatically leaving a room after giving one. The character is based on the real person of the same name who took over as editor-in-chief of Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump from Sasaki in 2011, and held the position until mid-2017. Soichi Aida : is one of the editor team-leaders at Sh≈çnen Jump, with both Hattori and Miura in his team. He is also the editor of Aoki-Nakai's manga Hideout Door. He gives helpful advice to Miura on occasion but is troubled by the stirs Ashirogi is causing. He later becomes deputy chief editor. Yujiro Hattori : is one of the youngest editors at Sh≈çnen Jump and editor of Eiji Nizuma's successful manga Crow as well as Fukuda's Kiyoshi Knight and later Road Racer Giri. Yujiro has difficulty keeping Eiji in line, but prides himself on finding such a talented manga artist. Because he shares the same last name as Akira, he is referred to by his first name while Akira as referred to as \\"Hattori\\". He finds it difficult to get along with Nizuma and Fukuda at first due to their eccentric or brash personalities, but soon becomes accustomed to them. Due to his success, he later becomes a team leader and matures as an editor as he learns to take into consideration the factors that allow manga creators and their editors need to succeed. Koji Yoshida : is an editor team-leader at Sh≈çnen Jump and the editor of Hiramaru. A perceptive and astute editor, Yoshida's editing style is unscrupulous and he will use any means to get his authors to work. In Hiramaru's case he uses bait in various forms, lies about this bait, and exploits of Hiramaru's interest in Aoki. He also tricks Hiramaru in buying an expensive car and renting an expensive apartment to keep him from saving up money and forcing him to continue to work. When interacting with Hiramaru, Yoshida's face is usually not visible for the reader, though Yoshida appears in full in the editing department, as a reflection of their antagonistic relationship. His ability to manipulate Hiramaru lessens over time, particularly when Hiramaru makes it apparent he is aware of Yoshida's machinations when he complains that Yoshida needs to be more effective, though Hiramaru comes to trust that Yoshida does seem to want what is best for him. Though his manipulations don't seem to work after Hiramaru is engaged to Aoki, Yoshida's lies seem sufficient to manipulate Nakai into assisting Hiramaru. Masakazu Yamahisa : is the editor behind Aoki's Time of Green Leaves and the editor of Ryu Shizuka. Yamahisa is a smooth-talker and attempts to garner the trust of his manga artist by reading their emotions. He personally decides to become Aoki's editor, seeing her marketability as a female manga artist, and helps her achieve success as a manga artist in Sh≈çnen Jump by playing to her strengths in writing romantic or fantasy stories. As Shizuka's editor, Yamahisa seems genuinely concerned for Shizuka because of his lack of social skills, taking it upon himself to civilize him to the point of taking him out to hostess bars (which was one of many options he listed). While some of Yamahisa's attempt to help Shizuka backfire, they ultimate contribute to Shizuka's ability to create an interesting manga series and allow Shizuka's confidence grow. By the end of the series, Yamahisa is shocked to see how cheerful Shizuka has become from his times out of his apartment; before this, he often had to track him down when he was not making manga like he was supposed to. Tatsurou Kosugi : is the editor of Toru Nanamine and the newest member of Jump's Editorial Department. Due to his inexperience and subservient personality he is an easy prey for Nanamine to exploit at first, but learns to become more assertive over time. He believes that his lack of experience is partially responsible Nanamine's disrespect towards the editorial department. Though Nanamine never shows any respect or any intent to listen to Kosugi's suggestions, Kosugi never wavers in his attempts to help Nanamine and expresses some remorse that Jump has lost a talented artist after Nanamine's final scheme fails and he is given a lifetime ban from Jump. At the end of the series, Kosugi is assigned to become the editor of Iwase and deal with her forceful personality much like Miura had before.

Early life  Bhavashankari came from a Brahmin family. Her father Dinanath Chaudhuri was a Nayak under the commander of the Pendo fort. Dinanath was a tall and well- built soldier, supremely skilled in the art of warfare. He himself commanded a troop of more than a thousand soldiers. He held a huge estate and encouraged his subjects to get themselves trained in warfare. Dinanath was considered among the respected nobilities of Bhurishrestha. Bhavashankari was born in Pendo, the first of two children of Dinanath. When she was young, her mother died while giving birth to her younger brother. While her brother was brought up by a foster mother, she spent her girlhood in the company of her father. From an early age, her father began to train her in horse riding, swordsmanship and archery. She was also dressed up in military armour and accompany her father on horseback. She grew up into a brave young soldier of Bhurishrestha. Then she took lessons in war, diplomacy, politics, sociology, philosophy and theology. =Marriage= Rajvallabhi, the 175px In her youth Bhavashankari used to go for hunting in the forest adjoining Damodar and Ron. Once while hunting a deer, she was attacked by wild bisons and she single handedly killed them. At that time the Rudranarayan, the king of Bhurishrestha was passing by in a sip along the Damodar towards Kasthasangara. The sight of a young woman killing a wild buffalo with a spear enthralled him. The royal marriage between Rudranarayan and Bhavashankari was fixed by royal priest Haridev Bhattacharya. Bhavashankari had initially resolved that, she would marry him who would defeat her in swordfight. However, as it was not possible for the king to engage in a mock swordfight with a commoner, she had to change her resolve. She proposed that the king shall have to sacrifice a pair of water buffaloes and a sheep in a single stroke in front of Rajballavi, the patron deity of Bhurishrestha along with her. Rajbalhat the old capital was named after the Hindu Goddess ‚Äì Rajbalhavi Devi. Reign After marriage, Bhavashankari moved to the newly built palace on Damodar, just outside the fort of Garh Bhawanipur. As the king's consort, she began to assist in the king in his royal duties. She took special interest in the military administration of the State. She regularly paid visits to the trainee soldiers and made arrangements for upgradation and modernisation of the military infrastructures. She began to encourage each and every subject to undergo military training. Gradually she made conscription compulsory in Bhurishrestha. She built new garrison fortresses along the boundaries of Bhurishrestha and renovated the existing ones. The kuladevata of the Bharadwaj dynasty of Bhurishrestha was Rajvallabhi, an incarnation of Chandi and her statue was made of ashtadhatu. Bhavashankari used to worship her and once made a wish that no man would ever be able to defeat her in a battle. After fasting for two days, her prayer was finally heard on the third day and her wish was granted. Jayadurga blessed her with her own strength and gave her a sword that lay at the bottom of the lake near the royal palace at Garh Bhawanipur. Full of devotion, Bhavashankari accepted the sword while taking a bath in the lake. Bhavashankari's Kuldevi Chandi is now the patron Goddess of entire Howrah district as Melai Chandi of Amta , Ma Makarchandi of Makardaha, Ma Jaya Chandi of Jaychandi Tala, a village near Domjur and Betai Chandi of Betai (Betor) in Howrah etc. She built a temple just outside the bordering moat of the fortress at Chhaunapur, near Tarakeshwar. The temple was connected to the adjoining fort by a tunnel. Apart from serving as an escape route it served as her temporary residence when she made administrative visits to the fort. She also built a Bhavani temple in the village of Bashuri. During this period, Bhurishrestha began to prosper in agriculture and trade. Indigenous industries like handloom textiles and metal works flourished. She also built the Temples of Devi Chandi at Amta, now the patron Goddess of entire Howrah district where Amta is situated. Soon Bhavashankari gave birth to prince Pratapnarayan. King Rudranarayan granted land and gold to the scholars and silvers, garments and food. Rudranarayan, however, died when Pratapnarayan was only five. Bhavashankari attempted to commit sati, but she was persuaded by the royal priest to act otherwise. However, she took a break from the affairs of the State to lead a life of a brahmacharini, for a period of three months. = Battle of Kastasangrah = 175px The Kingdom of Bhurishrestha was mostly neutral during rule of the Pathan Nawabs of Gaur & Pandua. However, on account of the conversion of Kalapahad by the Karranis, Rudranarayan started making extensive war preparations in anticipation of a possible invasion. After being defeated by the Mughals, the Pathans of Bengal took refuge in Orissa. From their base in Orissa, the Pathans under the leadership of Osman Khan were planning to invade Bengal once again.Land and Local Kingship in Eighteenth- Century Bengal By John R. McLane Bhavashankari entrusted the affairs of the State with Durlabh Dutta, the revenue minister and Chaturbhuj Chakravarti, the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and left for the Shiva temple at Kastasangrah along with prince Pratapnarayan, accompanied with her most trusted female bodyguards. She however used to remain in clad in war attire throughout most part of the day and carried her sword and firearm with her. At the temple, the Lord was being worshipped every day; Brahmins, monks and beggars were being fed and Shiva kirtan was being held every evening. Bhavashankari used to engage herself in Shiva sadhana every night, when she meditated alone inside the temple, with only a handful of bodyguards outside. In the meanwhile, Chaturbhuj Chakravarti entered into a secret pact with Pathan general Osman Khan, where he along with his forces would join the Pathan forces in a battle against the Mughals and upon the Pathan victory he would become the new ruler of Bhurishrestha. The Pathan forces, fed with intelligence inputs from Chaturbhuj Chakravarti, set out to capture Bhavashankari and her son alive. Osman Khan himself, along with twelve of his well-trained, experienced and most trusted soldiers infiltrated into the territory of Bhurishrestha in the guise of Hindu monks. Another contingent of 200 Pathan soldiers would follow them in disguise. However, Osman's advanced forces were spotted at Amta and as the news reached the queen, she summoned a detachment of 200 guards from the nearest garrison. At nightfall, she put on svetapatta over her armoured attire and engaged herself in worship. Her female bodyguards took guard outside the temple and the soldiers spread themselves along the jungles. The battle ensued when one of the Pathan soldier tried to enter the temple complex by breaching the security. The female bodyguards swung into action and a swordfight ensued. Soon the royal guards joined the fight. The Pathans were miserably defeated and as they tried to escape, the royal guards chased and killed them. The second detachment of Pathan mercenaries were killed by the warrior monks of the Shaiva akhara in the nearby jungles in the wee hours. Osman fled. = Coronation and the Battle of Bashuri = Bhavashankari returned to the capital early next morning and assumed control of the affairs of the State. In absence of hard evidence, she couldn't try Chaturbhuj Chakravarti, she instead demoted him in the pretext of security breach. Raja Bhupati Krishna Ray, the commander of the Pendo fort, was promoted to the post of Sarbadhinayak, the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. Apart from that she took immediate steps to strengthen the army in terms of numbers as well as infrastructure. She herself took the responsibility of their training. At that time Bhavashankari frequently visited the Chhaunapur fort named after Chhauni or Cantonment. During her visits she used to visit the Bhavani temple at the nearby Bashuri village at least once. Her official coronation was also to be held at the temple according to Tantric rites. Golok Chattopadhayay, an eminent practitioner of Tantra was to preside over the coronation ceremony. 200px In the meanwhile, the Pathans regrouped and once again bought Chaturbhuj. The latter declined to directly join the Pathan forces against the Queen, but assured of sabotage. Osman Khan and Chaturbhuj conspired to capture Bhavashankari on the night of her coronation, when she would be guarded only by a few of her female bodyguards. Accordingly, Osman led a contingent of five hundred Pathan soldiers and infiltrated into Bhurishrestha territory. After travelling throughout the night, they camped in a jungle near Khanakul on the morning of the D-Day. The Pathan army was spotted in the jungle by Kalu Chandal, a hunter, who reported it to the police at Khanakul. The officer in duty immediately dispatched a Dandanayak with the news to Garh Bhawanipur. At that time Raja Bhupati Krishna Ray was away at Pendo fort, and the acting commander Chaturbhuj dismissed the incident as a false alarm. The Dandanayak not impressed with Chaturbhuj's complacency, dispatched the news to Pendo. In the afternoon, Chaturbhuj advanced with his forces towards Khanakul. In the evening he sent a message to Osman Khan, suggesting him to launch the attack towards the end of the night. The Pathans emboldened by Chaturbhuj's support started moving towards Bashuri, crossing the Damodar near Pursurah. After the coronation ceremony was over, she received a message from Raja Bhupati Krishna Ray, updating her on the recent developments. She immediately deployed the troops from Chhaunapur, Basdingagarh, Lashkardanga and the female battalion. An elephant brigade of 100, a cavalry of 500 and an infantry of 500 readied for the battle. The royal advisor Haridev Bhattacharya arranged irregulars from the local Bagdi and Chandal population. On the other hand, Raja Bhupati Krishna Ray led the troops from Pendo and Dogachhia to confront the renegade battalion of Chaturbhuj Chakravarti. As the Pathan forces approached they were cornered into a battle ground surrounded with trenches on the three sides. The Pathan forces initially mistook the Bhurishrestha army as the renegade army of Chaturbhuj. In the resulting confusion, they lost the initial edge. Osman tried desperately to turn on the tables but in vain. Bhavashankari herself led the battle atop an elephant, and armed with her hand cannon Rudragnishakti she accounted for a sizeable Pathan casualty. The superior warfare skills of Bhurishrestha soldiers coupled with the strategic advantage, led them to victory. Osman Khan, wounded and defeated, fled the battle ground. After a lot of hardship he reached Orissa in the guise of a fakir. = Relationship with Mughals = Mughal emperor Akbar, who was always wary of a Pathan resurgence in Bengal, decided to strengthen the alliance with Bhurishrestha. He sent Man Singh, the then governor of Bengal to the court of Bhurishrestha as the representative of the Mughal Empire. Man Singh arrived at Garh Bhawanipur with the Mughal seal. In a special ceremony, the charter of alliance was signed between the Kingdom of Bhurishrestha and the Mughal Empire. Through this treaty, the sovereignty of Bhurishrestha was formally accepted by the Mughal empire. The treaty required the former to send a gold coin, a goat and a blanket to the latter as a token of alliance. Maharani Bhavashankari was bestowed with the title of Raybaghini and the Mughals never ever interfered with her Kingdom of Bhurshut. Later life Two years after prince and heir apparent Pratapnarayan's marriage, the queen abdicated her throne in favour of the prince. She however, acted as the supervisor and mentor to her successor son. Few years later when Pratapnarayan began to prove his ability as a ruler, she handed over to him all the other royal duties and retired to a spiritual life. She left for Kashi and spent the rest of her life there. Legacy Maharani Bhavashankari became famous by her title Raibaghini, who gradually came to denote a courageous or sometimes rebellious woman and became a part of Bengali proverb. Her story of valour became a part of folklore and were immortalised by ballads and village poets. In February 2012, the West Bengal government inaugurated the annual Raybaghini Rani Bhavashankari Smriti Mela to commemorate her.

It is located in Dixie National Forest, about from Cedar City. The settlement was founded in 1868 as a second attempt to mine iron from Iron Mountain after a disappointing yield from Cedar City. The colony lasted until 1876, when strife from the Edmunds‚ÄìTucker Act and the Panic of 1873 forced its closure. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. History The remains of a blast furnace at Old Iron Town. Brigham Young left Nauvoo, Illinois to establish Salt Lake City in 1847. Young quickly realized that the fastest way to an independent Mormon state was to make the new colony self-sufficient. One important resource in this regard was iron, which was very expensive to ship from the eastern United States. The towns of Parowan and Cedar City were founded in 1851 to provide iron for the settlers, which was mined in the Iron Mountain District. Problems plagued the early furnace at Cedar City, and only about of pig iron was produced over a three- year period. Iron was nonetheless needed for continued Mormon prosperity, so a second furnace at Old Irontown (Little Pinto) was made in 1868, using iron ore deposits at the southwestern base of Iron Mountain. By 1874, about of pig iron was produced, when operations ceased, and then abandoned 10 years later. At its peak, the settlement included a schoolhouse, blacksmith, charcoal furnaces, and a foundry. The city was abandoned in 1876. An attempt was made to revive mining from Iron Mountain, but the church was struggling with litigation over the Edmunds‚ÄìTucker Act and the Panic of 1873. Today, the ruins feature a preserved beehive style charcoal oven and a furnace known as an \\"Arastra\\", which prepared sands for molds. Parts of the original foundry remain, including the chimney. The site was fenced off by the Sons of Utah Pioneers. It is currently within grounds designated as the Dixie National Forest. The Frontier Homestead State Park Museum in Cedar City provides information about and artifacts from the site. The ruins are found on Iron Town Road, which intersects with Utah State Route 56. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 14, 1971 as Old Iron Town. There are also a number of newer, occupied homes at the town's location.

Between 1795 and 1798 it visited the Pacific. It was most famous for the rescue of Thomas Muir, a famous Scottish political exile. Muir was convicted of sedition before the High Court of Justiciary at Edinburgh in 1793. He was sentenced and transported to the convict settlement at Sydney Cove for the space of fourteen years on 31 August 1793. Otter, commanded by Capt. Ebenezer Dorr, was fitted out at Boston, and despatched for Sydney. The Boston register of clearances, Treasury Department archives, dates her clearance 20 August 1795. She anchored in Sydney Harbour on 25 January 1796. On 11 February 1796, Muir escaped from the convict settlement on board Otter. Captain Dorr took Muir and other escaped political prisoners onboard and sailed to the Pacific Northwest Coast. There the Otter cruised for furs in the spring and summer of 1796. Some sources say that the ship struck a chain of sunken rocks near Nootka Sound, on the west coast of North America, and was wrecked. Every person on board perished except Mr. Muir and two sailors. This is unlikely. Other reliable sources state that when Muir parted from Otter at Nootka in June 1796, Otter continued north to Bucareli Bay, on the west of Prince of Wales Island and then sailed into the harbor of Monterey on 29 October 1796, the first United States vessel to enter a Californian port. The voyage of Otter across the Pacific was famously chronicled by Pierre Fran√ßois P√©ron. Description Little is known of Otter. Some accounts state that she was probably a 168-ton ship, the Master was Daniel Bennett and she was owned by Loring & Curtis. It is most probable that her homeport was Boston. Spanish accounts state that she carried six cannon and a crew of twenty-six men. Captain Ebenezer Dorr circa 1800 Captain Ebenezer Dorr Ebenezer Dorr was born in Suffolk Massachusetts on 30 Dec. 1762. He was the fourth in his family to bear that name. In 1775 his father Ebenezer Dorr (1738-1809), like Paul Revere, rode from Boston to warn residents of Massachusetts about the advancing British army. On 16 Sept 1790 he sailed from Boston aboard the brigantine as supercargo under Captain Joseph Ingraham on a voyage to the Northwest Coast and China for the Old China Trade. The voyage was ultimately a financial failure. Dorr returned to Boston with Hope in the summer of 1793. In 1795 Dorr was given command of Otter on his second voyage to the Pacific. Thomas Muir circa 1793 The rescue and transportation of Thomas Muir The incident in which Otter rescued Thomas Muir, a famous Scottish political exile, is well documented. Muir was sentenced on 31 August 1793 to be transported for sedition for a term of fourteen years. In the middle of April 1794, he left England on board , and after a tedious voyage reached Sydney on September 25 of the same year. At this time Sydney was still a very small colony at Sydney Cove with about 1,500 people. Muir stated in letters that he purchased a \\"small hut and several acres of land\\". Accounts indicate that the land was located in the immediate vicinity of Jeffrey Street in the modern suburb of Kirribilli. After Muir had been in this penal settlement about two years, a project was formed in America to rescue him from captivity. Some sources credit the American president, George Washington, with the rescue attempt. Other sources discredit this idea. An authoritative paper titled \\"The Odyssey of Thomas Muir\\" by Marjorie Masson and J. F. Jameson examines the escape of Muir from the convict settlement at Sydney. Otter, commanded by Captain Dorr, was fitted out at Boston, and despatched to Sydney, where she anchored on 25 January 1796. Captain Dorr and a few of his crew landed at the very spot where Mr. Muir was located (the vicinity of Jeffrey Street in the modern suburb of Kirribilli), under the pretence that they were proceeding to China and were in want of fresh water. The captain had an audience with Mr Muir, and not a moment was lost. On the morning of 11 February 1796, Muir was safely taken on board Otter, which instantly set sail.Page 289 Other accounts state that Muir rowed out of the harbour and met Otter outside the Heads. Muir's own account of his escape, as given in subsequent letters preserved in Spanish archives, is that Captain Dorr, coming into Port Jackson in January 1796 agreed to give him a passage to Boston provided he could effect his escape without danger to Dorr. On the evening of February 18, the day before Dorr was to sail, Muir put to sea in a small boat, with two servants, taking nothing with him but the shirt and coat on his back, and that about the middle of the next day they boarded Otter at a considerable distance from land. One account states that as many as 20 convicts escaped from the penal colony in Port Jackson aboard Otter. Three of the convicts were left on Nomuka Island in Ha'apai Tonga on 15 March 1796. Otter subsequently landed at Pukapuka on 3 April 1796. Pierre Fran√ßois P√©ron, first mate on board Otter and chronicler of the voyage, gave the island the name \\"Isles de la Loutre\\" (Isles of the Otter) . The following day, P√©ron and a small party landed and some trading took place near the ship as adzes, mats and other artifacts were exchanged for knives and European goods. Some accounts state that many months later Otter was wrecked when she struck a chain of sunken rocks near Nootka Sound, on the west coast of North America. These accounts report that every person on board perished except Mr. Muir and two sailors. However other reliable sources state that Otter continued north to Bucareli Bay, on the west of Prince of Wales Island and cruised the Northwest Coast acquiring sea otter pelts. Whether Muir went with her, or remained for a space at Nootka, or was transferred to some other ship. First hand accounts (by P√©ron) omits to say. P√©ron makes no further mention of Muir until, on 31 October 1796, he reached Monterey going south, where he states that Muir had preceded him. At the time the Spanish settlement at Nootka Sound, protected by Fort San Miguel, had been abandoned for less than a year, by the terms of the third Nootka Convention. The buildings and gardens remained for years afterwards. Entry into the port of Monterey Spanish accounts note that Otter is said to have been the first United States vessel to arrive at Monterey, California. Otter was described as a United States man- of-war. She carried six cannon and a crew of twenty-six men. Entering the port of Monterey, her captain was supplied with wood and water. When ready to sail he asked permission of Governor Borica to land eleven English sailors who had secretly boarded his vessel at Botany Bay, Australia. The Governor refused his consent. It was a violation of Spanish law to land any foreigners. The shrewd Yankee captain, however, that night forced the sailors at the point of a pistol to go ashore. He then speedily put to sea. Borica was very angry. Making the best of the situation, however, he put the men to work as carpenters and blacksmiths. Subsequent records Otter is recorded as having subsequently visited Hawaii in 1796. The record states that Otter was on the Boston registry with Ebenezer Dorr, master. It sighted Hawaii on 2 December 1796 and left Kauai on 1 January 1797. Otter then took the sea otter hides it had gathered and sailed to Canton, where it remained from 13 February to 27 March. It arrived at Portland, Maine, almost a year later, on 27 January 1798.Ogden, Adele (1975) The California Sea Otter Trade, 1784-1848. (University of California), p.157. Upon her return to New England the Otter was sold to new owners. In 1798 the vessel was captured by the French and lost at sea. Captain Ebenezer Dorr returned to Boston, where he died in 1847.

Career  As a young man, he participated in crusades in Prussia and The Holy Land. His uncle Robert III of Artois, which had English sympathies, made him journey in 1346 to Calais to meet Edward III of England, who was besieging the city. Robert made a good impression on the King.

Born in Barcelona, Grases graduated from the School of Architecture in Barcelona in 1878 and moved to Madrid shortly after. Through to the turn of the century he worked on residential projects, and proposed a realignment of the entire city, the Proyecto de Gran V√≠a Norte-Sur, which was not adapted but influenced the subsequent urban planning in the city. In 1902 Grases won a national design competition for the Monument to Alfonso XII of Spain to be erected in the Buen Retiro Park. His design was a grand and elaborate curved colonnade, topped with a bronze equestrian statue of the king by sculptor Mariano Benlliure, and incorporating the work of 21 other artists. The monument was inaugurated on 3 July 1922, after Grases' death. The architect also designed perhaps the most significant example of Art Nouveau in Madrid, the Palacio Longoria, built in 1903 for financier Javier Gonz√°lez Longoria with a surface fabric seemingly sculpted out of cake frosting. (Many sources indicate Grases was influenced by Antoni Gaud√≠, but this stylistically dubious, and there's no clear evidence for it.) Other work in Madrid includes the Palacio de la Equitativa, built for the insurance company from 1887 to 1891, with its ornate tower and sculpted elephant heads, and the 1901 monument to Antonio C√°novas del Castillo in the Plaza de la Marina Espa√±ola, with sculptor Joaqu√≠n Bilbao.

For their first release, Long Way From Home, issued in 2007 by Eden Records, Sobel, Kolbeck and Burgess were joined by three Burgess associates: Yves Altana, Achim Faerber and percussionist Kwasi Asante. Vocalist Anna-Lynne Williams (of Trespassers William) guested on the song Fakers. In 2009, In the Ether, a track from the first album, was featured in the film Adventureland. In November 2008, Sobel and Burgess were joined by Andy Whitaker and Andy Clegg to reform the Sun and the Moon for a one-off US show in Sobel's hometown of Atlanta, Georgia. During practice sessions for the show, several new songs were written which later became the basis for Black Swan Lane's second album, The Sun and the Moon Sessions, released in June 2009. Asante also collaborated on this album. In April 2010, the band released their third album, Things You Know and Love, to critical acclaim. In July 2010, Black Swan Lane became official website sponsors of UK-based non-league football club Didcot Town. This sponsorship was extended for the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 football seasons, and in the 2017-2018 season, the band sponsored the club's First Team shirt. In August 2011, the band released their fourth studio album, Staring Down the Path of Sound. For the first time, Burgess did not participate. Sobel and Kolbeck were joined by Lauren Fay, who provided additional backing vocals. In May 2013, BSL's fifth studio album, The Last Time in Your Light, was released.

Fourteen genera within the Asteraceae are also galled by P. macrosporus. The description of the genus was based on Protomyces macrosporus as the type genus for the family Protomycetaceae. Physical appearance P. macrosporus galls on a petiole and mid-rib of A. podagraria The gall develops as a chemically induced swelling, arising from the surface of the leaf lamina, veins, mid-ribs, and petiole. On the leaf lamina it forms yellowish bulges standing out on the upper surface, but missing the black sori that are typical of an otherwise similar gall caused by the rust fungus Puccinia aegopodii. On veins, mid-ribs and petioles the gall appears as translucent yellow-white swellings that are often elongated and blister-like. It is particularly apparent in early spring when the greatly distorted leaves first appear. Life cycle Protomyces macrosporus has a complex life cycle including ascospores and chlamydospores. Spores reach the hosts via air movements and are spread from the galls that develop on the petioles, midrib veins, and lamina; they will only germinate on the correct host. Distribution The species has been recorded in Scotland, Ireland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Nepal, Germany, North America, North Africa and South Asia. Agricultural significance The stem gall caused by Protomyces macrosporus is the most serious and widespread disease of coriander in the Chitwan valley of Nepal.

Career The career of Farouk Abdulaziz had been quite multi-foliate since its inception some 45 years ago. Before obtaining his BA degree in English literature from the Faculty of Arts in Cairo University, he was involved in writing comic strips for Disney's Middle East Arabic language franchise; the weekly Mickey where he published his noted one-year-long series The Gates of Cairo (1967‚Äì1968). Working with writer Congressman Paul Findley during a Dubai shoot of Farouq's new 2012 documentary Fresh from college in 1968 Farouk had managed to hammer his way up to the then Arab world's most prestigious literary and art publication; Cairo's monthly Al Majallah ('The Magazine') to publish his translation of Paul Klee's lecture in book form on Modern Art in Arabic. The impact was sensational and immediate. Farouk got employment (1968‚Äì1977), albeit free lancing, to cover exclusively formative arts' activities in the Egyptian capital's unique evening newspaper; the daily Al Massa ('The Evening'). That is where his second translation of Klee serially appeared; Paul Klee's masterful rendition of the formative tools of creativity in shape and form; Pedagogical Sketchbook. In 1969 Al Majallah published Farouk's translation of 3 articles authored by Henry Moore, a writing rarity by the English landmark sculptor. Another English sculptor and painter; Hubert Dalwood was Farouk's guest in 1974 in an Egyptian Radio show as well as in live appearances in Cairo and Alexandria's Faculty of Fine Arts. Radio Farouk's contact with the Egyptian Radio was initiated during the finale of his college undergraduate years. Again it was the translation from English that helped him get through Program 2, a channel dedicated to presenting and discussing classical music, arts, theatre, film, international literature and more. His Arabic translations of short stories by Katherine Mansfield, William Saroyan and Henry James were aired (1967‚Äì1969); an effort that led to his employment, in 1974, by Egypt's Radio Authority to join Program 2 as a commentator on arts and film. Farouq had even shown an undercurrent skill in acting out Scott Fitzgerald in a Program 2 radio play written by Farouq. Farouk returned to write and present film shows on Kuwait Radio (1999‚Äì2002) where his Cinema and the World and Comedian were widely received. Press Abdul-Aziz's contribution to film criticism, which turned out to be almost the mainstream drive of his career since 1974, started by publishing critique of films produced by 'national cinemas' of the world including Soviet, Hungarian, Egyptian and Arab marginal, as well as US independents. He contributed to editing a book on the Cine Nuevo of Brazil published by The Egyptian Film Critics' Association EFCA in 1975. Farouq's critique writings appeared almost regularly in Cairo Cine-Club's weekly Film Bulletin, the Al Massa daily; the Al Talia (The Avant-Garde) monthly art supplement and aired on Program 2 Radio. A few articles found their way to get published in several Arabic periodicals. By 1977 Farouq had become the film critic for two Kuwait dailies; the Arabic language Al Seyassah ('Politics') and the English language Arab Times. In the following year he joined the Arabic language daily Al Watan ('Homeland') till 1983 and the English language daily The Kuwait Times until 1990. A 4-year stint with the Arabic language daily Al Qabas ('The Torch') followed Al Watan's engagement (1983‚Äì1987). He contributed to Britain's Arts & the Islamic World magazine, spring 1985 issue, an article on the status quo and history of media production in Kuwait that eventually appeared in a book published by Kuwait's Ministry of Information in 1986. Farouq's contribution to the pan-Arab popular monthly Al Arabi ('The Arab') and Al Funoon (Arts) of Kuwait, among others, has continued, although intermittently, for over 25 years. Television Farouk's TV debut took place when he shared the presentation of Egypt's weekly show Film Archive during the spring season of 1975. He later took over writing and presenting the show by himself. The show hosted many a film personality including the 'revolutionary' Cuban pioneering filmmaker Tomas Gotierrez Alea and the head of the Institute of Cuban Cinema ICAIC. The show had always boasted presenting avant-garde films from several national cinemas including Humberto Solas' Lucia and Alea's Memories of Underdevelopment from Cuba. Ralph Nader's Washington DC interview enhances the certerpiece issues in Farouq's upcoming political documentaryThe Cine-Club show debuted on Kuwait TV by October 1979 featuring Fred Zinnemann's 1967 period piece A Man for All Seasons. The show, written/produced and presented by Farouq, had scored an immediate popularity in Kuwait and adjacent regions in Southern Iraq and selected countries in the Persian Gulf region. Farouk's list of guests on the show included Vanessa Redgrave, Anthony Quinn among many. The Cine-Club showcased cinemas that were virtually unheard of by the movie crowd in the Persian Gulf; Chinese, German, Swedish, Romanian, Soviet, Italian and French. A select of Hollywood mainstream and independent productions were also introduced. The show kept airing for more than a decade (1979‚Äì1992) leaving an indelible impact through its methodical analysis and criticism. A revival of the show took place by 2001 to run for one year on Kuwait TV's free satellite channel. Kuwait Cine Club The retired Dean of White House correspondents speaks her mind in Farouq Abdul-Aziz' new political documentary 2012 By fall of 1976 Farouk's settlement in Kuwait had marked a welcome resumption of his Egyptian career. The first assignment was to write and produce 3 documentaries in 2 years for the Kuwait Oil Company KOC. During that period Farouk was employed to run the newly founded Kuwait Cine-Club, the first nonprofit cinematic cultural organization to be founded in the Persian Gulf region, a tenure that lasted 16 years (1977‚Äì1992). The outcome of the KCC experience had been quite rewarding; the programs devised and executed by Farouk included the organization of more than 60 film festivals and events. National cinemas as well as US and British independents were introduced for the first time in the region and film personalities were invited including Anthony Quinn, Vanessa Redgrave, Mrinal Sen, Shadi Abdussalam, and Yusuf Chahine. The club's publications of periodicals and festival booklets had certainly helped diffuse film culture in the area as reflected in the Kuwait press and the club's membership rise. Farouk was invited by the Cine-Club's board of directors to become the club's advisor as advertised in several publications including the electronic newspaper Al Aan. International Film Festival Juror The Egyptian government's crash on the so-called 'leftist sympathies' by the mid 70s, had resulted in the closure of all 'suspected' publications, all of which were venues for Farouk's work. The hostile move led to the cancellation of Farouq's television and radio shows while he was participating in Baghdad's International Film Festival on Palestine in February 1976. Farouk, representing EFCA, was selected a member of The Arab Film Critics' Circle's jury in this festival where he was interviewed in extreme length and in-depth by Moroccan writer Ahmad Al Medeini for the Al Moharrer (The Editor) daily published in May 1976. On stage (4th from right) as the international jury was being presented at the opening ceremony of the 1980 edition of the Intl Oberhausen Film Festival in Germany The interview was only the beginning in a series of domestic and international interviews, from Cairo to Kuwait, Baghdad to India, and Britain. Farouq's US press interviews include one conducted by Variety's Gordon Hitchens in July 1981 followed by another Variety feature by Hank Werba who supervised a dossier on TV & Cinema in the Persian Gulf region in February 1982. In 1984 a Los Angeles Times article on Gulf finance and movie making by Jean Brody featured Farouk AbdulAziz highlighting his role in raising awareness about cinematic culture. Foreign radio interviews include Voice of America of Washington DC in July 1981 and Radio Orient of Paris in 2009. In April 1980 Farouq was invited to sit on the Jury of the International Short Film Festival in Oberhausen, Germany. The Kurtzfilmtage showcased short features, cartoons as well as documentaries. The event echoed Farouk's juror role in a 1976 edition of Cairo's National Short Feature and Documentary Films' Festival. The Jury roster is highlighted by several Jury jobs as a representative of Egyptian Film Critics Association at the International Federation of Film Critics FIPRESCI panel of the 1984, 1985, and 1987 editions of Cannes Film Festival. In 1995 Farouk had also been invited to join the jury panel of the Ismailia International Short and Documentary Film Festival in Egypt. Documentary production =Vanessa talks with Farouk Abdulaziz= With Vanessa Redgrave on location in England shooting Vanessa talks with Farouk Abdulaziz in summer of 1978 The third edition of Baghdad Film Festival on Palestine, held in March 1978, was highlighted by the participation of the political actress Vanessa Redgrave. Fresh from Southern Lebanon, she came to a highly politicized film event with Roy Battersby's powerful documentary The Palestinian featuring Vanessa in camps and mountains where the fighters were. Taken by the film's revolutionary output Farouk managed to interview her for Baghdad TV, followed by a press interview for Kuwait's Arab Times. The Arabic version of which has subsequently appeared in the Kuwait's Arabic daily Al Sayassah (Politics). But winning Best Supporting Actress Academy Award (Oscar) of 1978 for her outstanding performance of the title role in Fred Zinnemann's Julia, and the controversy that shrouded her nomination thru the acceptance speech, was the driving force behind going for a full-fledged documentary about Vanessa. Farouk pitched the project to Vanessa who set all elements in place; New Park to produce, Roy Battersby to helm and Chris Menges to shoot (later himself a filmmaker). With the completion of Farouq's script, the project got a head start with Farouq as the on-camera interviewer. Vanessa talks with Farouk Abdulaziz took almost 2 years in the making as Vanessa was busy shooting the CBS film Playing for Time. Father Sir Michael Redgrave gave a special King Lear appearance with Vanessa playing Cordelia in the one-hour documentary. In her 1991 book Vanessa Redgrave; an Autobiography (Random House/New York) Vanessa talks, among other related incidents, about the circumstances that led to the production of her documentary with Farouk. =The Making Of Omar Mukhtar ‚Äì Lion Of The Desert= In late 1979 Farouk was hired by US‚Äô Falcon International to write and produce a documentary on the making of the company's Hollywood major feature film; Lion of the Desert. The mega million dollar movie was produced and directed by Mustapha Akkad, with an all Academy Award winner cast and crew. Farouk wrote the script and conducted the interviews with Anthony Quinn, Rod Steiger, Oliver Reed and Jack Hildyard in addition to the Producer/Director Akkad. Two original versions in Arabic and English came out upon the film's release in 1981. =NHK and other ventures= The liaison with NHK, Japanese TV started after the release of Farouk's production of the Arabic version of the Swiss production and sales consortium Telepool's The Great National Parks of Europe. Farouq was commissioned in 1987 to produce the international version of NHK's 18-hour The Silk Road. Farouk ended up co-writing the series (segments related to the Islamic world) and directing the English version for a worldwide release including England's ITV and Canada's History Channel. The following year Farouk had received yet another commissioning from Turkey's Ministry of Culture to write, produce and direct the 35 minute documentary Merhaba, a visual rendition of Turkey's historical and cultural fresco. The first Gulf War got Farouk involved in researching and producing stories to serve many a client including BBC, Channel 4, CBS and NBC for a period of 7 months after the liberation of Kuwait in February 1991. In the same period Farouq researched and produced the Kuwait segment of Mark Magidson's 70 mm production of Ron Fricke's film Baraka, a non-verbal feature film. In the mid 90s Farouk was busy developing and pitching his first feature film venture Love in Exile. The project was set for a co-production deal with the Irish production entity Meem Productions, with Farouq writing and helming. It had been announced during the 1996 edition of Cannes Film Festival in the 17 May Cannes issues of The Moving Picture and Screen International. The project didn't take off though. =Religion vs science= By April 2008 Farouk kicked off the production of two documentaries in two original versions exploring the interaction of Holy Scriptures with science; a job that took almost 2 years. Maurice and the Pharaoh and From Microcosm to Macrocosm were released in spring 2010. On January 10, 2011 'Maurice and the Pharaoh' and From Microcosm to Macrocosm were awarded the Sheikh Fahad Al Ahmad International Award for Charity for 'the distinguished creativity in sending a humanitarian message'. Both works received funding from Kuwait's Nasser Abdul-Mohsen Al Sa'eed Charitable Third. Officer Varley is one of a group who voiced their thoughts in Signs & Voices 2012 Universal Expansion as perceived in 'Expanding Universe 2012 A third documentary, Gates of Heaven, probing another area in this topic is released in spring 2012. As further research in this area expanded, five more documentaries were produced and released in October 2012 on the internet to a great reception. According to YouTube stats a record viewership number (given the scientific/cultural content of the material) is registered in a week's time 37504. The Great Split examines the Big Bang Theory; The Expanding Universe explores the acceleration of the process, The Hobok: The Cosmic Web gives a detailed account of the structure and texture of the universe as described in one Qur'anic word. Signs and Voices tells a few stories of a select group recounting the impact the scientific signs in the Qur'an had left on them. Finally In its Orbit explains how the concepts of Earth's roundness and just being a planet in the universe not at the center of it are singled out in the Qur'an 1400 years ago. The films are funded by Bodoor Charity of Kuwait. The Sheikh Fahad Al Ahamad International Award for Charitable Achievement of 2010 was awarded to Farouq Abdul-Aziz' most recent productions; Maurice & the Pharaoh' and 'From Microcosm to Macrocosm'.. Animated films Farouk was commissioned by LA's Cartoon and Animation Center (1998‚Äì2000) to write 3 animated feature ‚Äì length films. Farouk had also advised the center on production while producing the Arabic version, in Syria's Zahra' Studio, of the center's feature Knights of Virtue. The animated film The Return of the Golden Queen, based on Farouq's story, was released in original English and Arabic versions in 2000. Adviser During the 80s Farouk had been advising Kuwait's ministers of information as to the implementation of foreign cultural protocols especially the film related events. He contributed to Britain's Arts & the Islamic World magazine, spring 1985 issue, an article on the status quo and history of media production in Kuwait that eventually appeared in a book published by Kuwait's ministry of Information in 1986. The advisory job was revived by the late 90s thru 2010. During that period Farouq advised several Kuwait government bodies on media affairs. For those bodies Farouk was commissioned to produce several documentaries and TV shows including Islamic Art; a View from the Bridge (1999), The Imprint of the Soul (2000), Love Letters (2000), Love thyself ‚Äì 11 episodes (2001), The Last Prophet (2005), To Be or Not to Be (2006), Barirah (2007) and Islamic Art; Legacy of a Nation (2009).

The cover art was made by Zbigniew M. Bielak, who also painted The Wild Hunt cover art.Mad Sin, 12 June 2013, accessed on 21 June 2013. The album sold around 1,000 copies in the United States in the first week of its release, reaching no. 42 on the Top New Artist Albums (Heatseekers) chart. The single \\"Reaping Death\\" was distributed in their home country of Sweden in the Sweden Rock magazine, and was certified gold in the band's home country on April 21 by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry for sales in excess of 10,000 copies. The album received very positive reviews from music critics, and in 2011 the band were awarded the Swedish Grammi for 'Best Hard Rock' album for Lawless Darkness.  Writing, composition  In regards to the album's title, Erik Danielsson said that \\"It‚Äôs an expression about liberating all bonds. To question everything around you, to break down all barriers that are around you. Some call it salvation and others liberation. Lawlessness can mean liberation.\\" Danielsson has also explained that he sees the band's previous album as the \\"foundation stone\\" of Lawless Darkness, \\"because with Sworn we had finally reached the artistic self-knowledge required for such a giant of an album. With that in our backs, we knew we could venture far into the dark‚Ä¶ And we did.\\" He described the album as a \\"thorough musical exploration of the darkside\\", and explained that the album's lyrics are based on the \\"exploration, glorification and adoration of the Devil; the eternal adversary and enemy of the world as we know it.\\" Expanding on the meaning behind the album, he said: > The idea of Lawless Darkness is based upon the thought that light is a > impulse of restriction and definition. Darkness, in turn, is the absence of > light, and therefore the absence of the same restrictions. Note that > Darkness in this context is also used as a spiritual and archetypal concept, > not only the physical absence of light during, for example, night-time. The > darkness that we refer to is the primordial wellspring of Chaos that is the > abode of our gods, and unto which their children, the bloodline of fire, > shall return.  Recording and production  According to Danielsson, the album was recorded over a period of about two months (January-February 2010), and has described it as \\" a rather intense and chaotic two months, working every day and every night for sixty days in a row with the exception of one, I think.\\" The album was again produced by Tore Stjerna, with whom the band has worked on all of their previous and subsequent albums. Danielsson has described working with Tore Sjterna as a \\"tradition\\" for Watain that has made the band what it is. \\"Why change a beneficial concept? There are numerous advantages with recording there, but the number one is probably that Tore is almost like member when we record, we know each other very well for many, many years, which is of course beneficial when doing something as intimate as an album recording. Watain is a special band, complicated in many ways, and Tore is one of the few persons that we have no problems working with.\\"  Artwork and packaging  Lawless Darkness digipak cover The artwork for the album was handled by Zbigniew M. Bielak. Danielsson explained that working with him made things much easier as it helped them realise their ideas. He said that \\"We sent him long letters and talked a lot on the phone describing in detail the symbolism and idea behind every song. Meticulous descriptions of symbols, myth, ancient lore, magical work, everything that we needed to have woven into the artwork. He was surprisingly understanding of our cause and goals.\\" Within the booklet, each song has original artwork by Bielak. 1,000 copies of a collector's edition of the album were available on the album's release. This boxset contained the digipak version of ‚ÄòLawless Darkness‚Äô, which includes the 'Chains of Death' Death SS cover. The box also contains a Watain symbol pendant with chain, a black candle in wrapping, a full colour flag and 10 tarot cards in a pocket, which have been specially designed (one for each song) by Erik Danielsson. This was packed in a solid beech box with real leather and a Watain logo imprint on the lid. Invisible Oranges named it as one of the best metal album covers of 2010. Watain wanted listeners to have a \\"special\\" and \\"ritualistic\\" listening experience.  Touring  In support of the album, Watain toured North America through November to December 2010 with the support of Black Anvil and Withered. Though it was originally intended to be a co-headline tour with Behemoth, Behemoth dropped out due to vocalist/guitarist Nergal needing to be urgently admitted to hospital for treatment of his leukaemia. The tour went ahead with Watain as the headlining act and included dates in Quebec, Washington, California, Texas, and New York. The tour was titled 'The Lawless States of Heretika Tour'. In February and March 2011, the band toured across Europe with Shining and Aosoth on the 'Death Holy Death Tour 2011'. This tour included shows in Denmark, Poland, France, Spain, as well as a five UK dates. Reception = Critical reception = The album received generally positive reviews from music critics. According to Eduardo Rivadavia, writing for Allmusic, \\"Lawless Darkness is black metal through and through, and Watain even make a point of retaining some cardboard-sounding drumbeats in honor of lo-fi pioneers like Venom and Bathory, ferchrissakes! This is why purists looking for their fix need only look to the pulverizing fury unleashed by 'Death's Cold Dark', 'Total Funeral', and 'Kiss of Death', or the Emperor- worthy melodies swirling madly across 'Hymn to Qayin', or the majestic glacial desolation of 'Malfeitor' and the instrumental title track. Finally, there's the ultimate swan dive into the abyss that is the 15-minute-long, all- encompassing 'Waters of Ain', which feels like a mini-album unto itself, and casts a blinding spotlight upon the full scale of Watain's latest, significant achievement for the advancement of black metal's cause.\\" About.com was similarly favorable to the album, calling the album \\"Epic black metal that doesn't come off as over-indulgent\\" and \\"an accumulation of everything Watain has done on the past three albums\\". Pitchfork was slightly less favorable to the album, though still positive on the whole. Comparing it to Watain's previous album Sworn to the Dark, Pitchfork's Tom Breihan criticised the production, writing that \\"the cleaner production feels more compressed and less immersive, like they're attempting to bludgeon you with sheer loudness rather than suck you into their universe\\". However, Breihan finished his review by saying \\"Still, judged on its own merits, this is pretty powerful stuff. Occasionally, the band hits levels of all-out ferocity so absurd that they actually sound pretty. Danielsson has a truly great black-metal voice, a ravaged and demonic back-of-the-throat gargle that only occasionally says anything I can decipher ('Rivers of blood! Rivers of blood!'). When they chant, 'Hail! Beelzebub!' on 'Four Thrones', they sound like they mean it, which somehow makes the whole thing more fun. These freaks still know what they're doing, even if they're just treading bloody water this time around.\\" = Accolades = The album was awarded the 2011 Swedish Grammi for 'Best Hard Rock' album. The album was named album of the year by Sweden Rock magazine, and the second best album of 2010 by Decibel, as well as artist of the year in the Terrorizer reader poll. About.com named it the 13th best metal album of 2010. The AllMusic staff named it as one of their favourite metal albums of 2010, describing it as one of the year's best albums in a strong year for extreme metal. Stereogum named it the 11th best metal album of 2010. The A.V. Club gave it the humorously titled 'Just Don‚Äôt Give A Fuck Award For 2010', writing that \\"The Swedish black metal provocateurs that make up Watain have built a career on pissing off fans, the press, and anyone else that happens to be paying attention. But the band‚Äôs not some talentless collective of media hackers: It backs its headache-inducing behavior with raw, savage, cutting- edge black metal, throwing in thrash, punk, and death elements just to keep things interesting.\\" A variety of prominent musicians in metal also called it as one of the best albums of 2010, including Tomas Lindberg, Frederic Leclerq, and Adam Pierce (All Shall Perish).

Thomas Ebenezer Beasley, a dissenting minister at Uxbridge.History of the Congregational Churches in the Berks, South Oxon. and South Bucks. Association, by William Henry Summers. Newbury: W.J. Blacket. 1905. p. 69. He was some time assistant in the school of the Rev. Lant Carpenter, LL.D., at Bristol, and was educated for the ministry (January 1826‚Äì29) at Manchester College, York, under Charles Wellbeloved (theology), John Kenrick, M.A. (classics), and William Turner, M.A. (science). He was minister at the Old Meeting, Dudley, 1829‚Äì32, and in 1832 became colleague of John Kentish (1768‚Äì1853) at the New Meeting, Birmingham (Joseph Priestley's congregation), and married Emily (d. 1855), second daughter of the Rev. Edward Higginson of Derby (1781‚Äì1832), whose eldest daughter, Helen (d. 1877), was the wife of the Rev. James Martineau. He had seven children, of whom Francis Edward Bache, the composer, was the eldest; another was Walter Bache, the musician; the youngest son, John Kentish, some time a dissenting minister, took Anglican orders in 1876. For many years Bache kept a school. In 1859 he took a leading part with the Rev. Dr. Miller, rector of St. Martin's, in the establishment of Hospital Sunday, an institution originated in Birmingham. He was visitor of Manchester New College, London, 1861‚Äì65. In 1862 the New Meeting, Moor Street, was sold to Roman Catholics, the congregation removing to a handsome structure in Broad Street, called the Church of the Messiah, Birmingham (foundation laid 11 August 1860). Mr. Bache had as colleague in 1863-7 the Rev. Henry Enfield Dowson. In 1868 he resigned the ministry from failing health, and, being afflicted with softening of the brain, he resided for the last two years of his life in the house of a physician at Gloucester, where he died on 7 January 1876 aged 71. He was a preacher and public man of strong powers, correct attainment, and cultivated taste; formal and urbane in manner. Among unitarians he represented the conservative school which aimed to carry out the principles of Locke's Reasonableness of Christianity, regarding Jesus Christ as the miraculously attested exponent of a pure morality and a simple theology, and the revealer, by his resurrection, of an eternal life. On 23 May 1866 he proposed the embodiment in the constitution of the British and Foreign Unitarian Association of a 'recognition of the special divine mission and authority, as a religious teacher, of Jesus Christ,' which was met by carrying the previous question. Works A list of twenty-two of his publications (1833‚Äì70) is given by J. Gordon, including: * Harmony of Science and Revelation, 1839. * Funeral Sermon for John Kentish, 1853. * Exposition of Unitarian Views of Christianity, 1854. * Miracles the Credentials of the Christ, 1863.

Entrance portal. The Abbey of Viboldone is an abbey in Viboldone, a frazione of San Giuliano Milanese, in the province of Milan, northern Italy. History The abbey was founded in 1176 and completed in 1348 by the Humiliati, an order of monks, nuns and lay people who worked in the abbey producing wool cloths and cultivated the nearby fields with innovative techniques. After the suppression of the Humiliati by Pope Pius V (1571), the abbey went to the Olivetan Benedictines, who were forced to leave the abbey in 1773, when Lombardy fell in Austrian hands. After several years of abandonment, the abbey is currently home to the Community of Madre Margherita Marchi (Benedictine nuns) since 1941. View of the interior. Architecture The fa√ßade (finished in 1348) is hut-shaped, with mullioned windows and visible brickwork with white stone decorations, and divided into three sectors by two semi-columns. The entrance portal is in white marble, and is surmounted by a lunette with marble sculptures of the \\"Madonna with Child between the Saints Ambrose and John of Meda\\". At its sides, two Gothic niches houses statues of the Sts. Peter and Paul. The door is in dark wood, and dates to the 14th century. The bell tower has an appearance similar to that of the fa√ßade, with frames in cotto and small arcades at the bases of the double and triple mullioned windows. The latter are surmounted by small circular windows. The interior is rather sober, with few decorations, aside from the extensive fresco decoration of the Giottesque school. It has a rectangular hall plan, with a nave and two aisles with five spans each (the first ones in Romanesque style, while the remaining ones are Gothic with cotto columns and high cross vaults). The arches are ogival. The fresco decoration includes the Madonna in Maest√† with Saints and the large Universal Judgement with, in the middle, Jesus and at his left the Damned, overlook by Satan. Other frescoes, depicting Renaissance musical instruments, are housed in the Music Hall, located in a building annexed to the church.

It was built by the counts of Lauffen in the 12th century, but in the 14th century became part of the Electorate of the Palatinate. The castle became an administrative center for the Electoral Palatinate and thus a target in the wars of the 17th and 18th centuries. In the 19th century, the castle fell into ruin and was used as a quarry. American writer Mark Twain visited the castle in the 1870s and wrote about it in A Tramp Abroad. As of 2020, Dilsberg Castle is administered by the heritage agency . History Dilsberg Castle was constructed in the mid-12th century by the to replace at Wiesenbach. The castle was also intended to secure the power of the Counts of Lauffen over the area against that of the Heidelberg-based Electorate of the Palatinate. The Counts of Lauffen died out at the start of the 13th century, however, and the castle passed to the and then, in 1310, to the Palatinate. To solidify his own control over the area, Rupert I expanded the castle with recycled stone from the old curtain wall. Rupert I also established a town, , at the castle by moving nearby townspeople to the fortress to create new tax income. A garrison was assigned to the castle and the town would become an important administrative center in the Palatinate. It was given town rights in 1347, but in the long term Rupert I's plan failed as Dilsberg was isolated from important roadways. As siege weapons grew more powerful, the military importance of Dilsberg declined. By the end of the 19th century, Dilsberg Castle had become the property of the government of Grand Duchy of Baden and was used as a prison. Around 1822, the castle was abandoned and became a public quarry. Beginning in the mid-19th century, Dilsberg Castle's ruins began appearing in the work of artists such as J. M. W. Turner, Carl Rottmann and , and even in Mark Twain's work, when he wrote about a legendary tunnel under the castle in A Tramp Abroad. Public interest in the castle grew during the 20th century, inspiring tourism and prompting the reconstruction of some of the castle, and the restoration of Dilsberg's town center. Architecture Staircase tower seen from atop the wall, from the south The first iteration of Dilsberg Castle was a simple, oval-shaped hilltop castle with a moat, curtain wall, and tower house built in the mid-12th century. Towards the end of that century, they replaced the tower house with a keep and added a palas. The Palatinate greatly expanded the castle and from 1360 on built the present fortress. The Palatine castle had an outer bailey whose curtain wall was lined with a barracks, prison, tithe barn, stables, and granary. A garden was laid out on the site of the barracks. Beyond two flanking towers was the inner bailey, surrounded by a enceinte accessed by a staircase tower, both rebuilt around 1900. Within the inner bailey was a five-story palas, demolished in 1794 and survived only by its undercroft, called the Witch's Cellar (Hexenkeller). The cellar was once used as a students' prison by the University of Heidelberg. The nearby Commandant's House was built around 1550 in the outer bailey and became the garrison commander's residence in 1648. When the castle was demolished in 1822, the Commandant's House survived because it was privately owned at the time. It was purchased by the city of Neckargm√ºnd in 1854 and thereafter used as the town hall, temporary housing, and a school from 1894 to 1982. When Neckargm√ºnd could no longer afford the upkeep for the Commandant's House, it was purchased in 1996 by the local district-level government, who renovated it into a cultural center the following year. The castle well, also in the inner bailey, is deep. Nearby, and under the castle, is an adit and tunnel measuring long. The well was dug in two phases; when the castle was first constructed the well was deep and was then deepened between 1650 and 1680 for the castle's permanent garrison. The tunnels were also dug in the second phase to ventilate fumes from the well's mining, and then was filled up. They passed into local legend as a secret passageway until they were rediscovered by a German-American named Fritz von Briesen around 1900. 20 years before, Mark Twain wrote about the tunnels in A Tramp Abroad.

The first four established interim dictatorships, while the last two established dictatorships of permanent type on the model of a bureaucratic-authoritarian state. The latter conducted a Dirty War in the line of State terrorism, in which human rights were systematically violated and there were tens of thousands of forced disappearances. In the 53 years since the first military coup in 1930, until the last dictatorship fell in 1983, the military ruled the country for 25 years, imposing 14 dictators under the title of \\"president\\", one every 1.7 years on average. In that period, the democratically elected governments (radicals, peronists and radical-developmentalists) were interrupted by coups.  Coup of 6 September 1930  General Jos√© F√©lix Uriburu started a series of coups and military dictatorship that would extend until 1983. The military coup of September 6, 1930 was led by General Jos√© F√©lix Uriburu and overthrew president Hip√≥lito Yrigoyen of the Radical Civic Union, who had been democratically elected to exercise his second term in 1928. In an unprecedented move, Uriburu also dissolved Parliament. Paradoxically, General Uriburu had been one of the organizers of the Revolution of the Park, a civic- military uprising that give rise to the Radical Civic Union. On September 10, Uriburu was recognized \\"interim\\" president of the Nation by the Supreme Court by the agreement that led to the doctrine of de facto governments and that would be used to legitimize all other military coups.Historia Integral Argentina, vol. 7, pp. 88-89 Following a trend which was repeated in future coups, Uriburu appointed a civilian as head of the Ministry of Economy, Jos√© S. P√©rez, who had links with the large landowners and the more conservative factions. The military leadership established a fascist government and, for drafting the first proclamation, appointed the writer Leopoldo Lugones. Lugones had joined the fascist cause in 1924 by giving a speech called \\"The Hour of the Sword\\", where he declared the deterioration of democracy, its instability and its evolution towards demagoguery. One of Uriburu's first initiatives was to establish an illegal repressive state structure, creating a \\"special section\\" of the police which could be used to systematically torture his opponents and which was the first such police division to use the picana, originally for cattle, against its victims. When Uriburu was unable to shore up the necessary political support to fully establish his fascist political regime, he called elections, but decided to prohibit the participation of the Radical Civic Union. The reinstituation of democracy was false, restricted and controlled by the Armed Forces. This electoral fraud gave rise to a period of conservative, corrupt governments which was dubbed the \\"Infamous Decade\\". On February 20, 1932, General Uriburu handed over power to General Agust√≠n P. Justo, the true force behind the coup who, although involved in the coup, wanted a democratic and limited government.  Coup of 4 June 1943  Generals Arturo Rawson, Pedro Pablo Ram√≠rez and Edelmiro Farrell, the three consecutive dictators of the Revolution of '43. The Revolution of '43 which started with a coup d'√©tat by the military on June 4, 1943, was distinct from the other Argentine coups in the following ways: * Ram√≥n Castillo, the toppled president, was part of the conservative regime which ruled during the \\"Infamous Decade\\" and which originated in the coup of 1930 and was supported by fraudulent general elections, repression and corruption. * It was the only military coup that unfolded in the midst of a world war. * It did not establish a relationship with the important landowners and businessmen. * Its outbreak was influenced by the pressure that the US was putting on Argentina to drop its position of neutrality with respect to World War II, with the goal of hurting British economic interests in the country and ultimately replacing the United Kingdom as the dominant economic power in Argentina. * It was the only coup in Argentina which was executed purely by the military and with popular support. \\"If Argentina can be effectively dominated, the State Department's control over the Western Hemisphere will be total. This will simultaneously help to mitigate the possible risk of Russian and European influence in Latin America and also separate Argentina from what is supposed to be our sphere of influence.\\" (translated) David Kelly, quoted in Escud√©, Carlos; Cisneros, Andr√©s (2000) * It was a true revolution in the sense that it toppled the conservative government with its fraudulent elections, established in 1930, and had the intention of being permanent. * Just like all the other institutional breakdowns in Argentina, it was very damaging to democracy. Although eliminating the \\"patriotic election rigging\\" of the previous decade, it continued with the line of harmful leaders in government. The Revolution of '43 was a confusing political process during which various groups, many of whom had never played a role in Argentina's history, vied for power. The coup itself was not executed to permanently establish control, so it was a transitory dictatorship that followed. All of the military groups fighting for power during the Revolution of '43 were markedly anti-communist and maintained strong ties to the Catholic Church which reestablished its presence (absent since the 19th century), especially in the area of education. Internal fighting unleashed two more coups, meaning there were three dictators succeeding each other in power and carrying the title of \\"president\\": Arturo Rawson, Pedro Pablo Ram√≠rez and Edelmiro Farrell. During this period, the Argentinian unions, mainly the socialists and the syndicalists as well as a few communists, formed an alliance with a group of young army officials led by the Colonel Juan Per√≥n. This alliance constituted the successful nationalist labor movement which prevailed by winning popular support from the working class and which was given the name \\"Peronism\\". This period was characterized by extreme polarization of the social classes and led to the formation of a large social block that was strongly anti-Peronist and made up mostly of the middle class and upper class. Economically, the Revolution of '43 saw the continuation of the policy of Import Substitution Industrialization. The dictatorship ended with a call for a democratic elections on February 24, 1946, which all the sections of society accepted as perfect. Juan Domingo Per√≥n won the elections and assumed the presidency on June 4, 1946. Per√≥n would later be overthrown by the military in 1955, before he finished his second term.  Coup of 16‚Äì23 September 1955  Generals Eduardo Lonardi and Pedro Eugenio Aramburu, the successive dictators of the Revoluci√≥n Libertadora. The so-called Revoluci√≥n Libertadora was a transitional military dictatorship, brought about by a coup d'√©tat which overthrew the president Juan Domingo Per√≥n and lasted between 16 and 23 September 1955. On the last day of this period, the leader of the insurrection, Eduardo Lonardi, was sworn in as president and congress was dissolved. On the following day, he designated Admiral Isaac Rojas as vice president. During the Revoluci√≥n Libertadora, the military government created a Civilian Advisory Board composed in large part of the political parties of the Radical Civic Union, the Socialist Party, the National Democratic Party, the Christian Democratic Party, and the Democratic Progressive Party. The group behind the coup was divided in two parts: a Catholic-nationalist part led by General Eduardo Lonardi, who took charge of the government initially, and a liberal- conservative part led by General Pedro Eugenio Aramburu and Admiral Isaac Rojas. The latter group ended up gaining power and executing another coup, replacing Lonardi with Aramburu as president. The dictatorship in power imposed a ban on Peron's Justicialist Party and began the persecution of its sympathizers, policies that would be maintained by successive governments over the following 18 years. The government also took over the unions. In actions that were unprecedented in the modern history of Argentina, it executed its opponents by firing squad, sometimes in public and sometimes clandestinely. The government appointed civilians to run the Ministry of Economy, which was run successively by Eugenio Folcini, Eugenio A. Blanco, Roberto Verrier and Adalberto Krieger Vasena, who pursued policies favorable to the most well-off and economically powerful sectors of society. One of most significant institutional measures taken by the military dictatorship was to send out a proclamation abolishing ipso facto, the then national constitution, known as the Constitution of 1949, and replacing it with the text from Argentina's Constitution of 1853. This measure would later be endorsed by the Constitutional Convention which was elected but excluded certain factions. After convening under the leadership and influence of the military regime, \\"article 14bis\\" was added to the constitution. In 1958, the government of the Revoluci√≥n Libertadora held a limited form of elections, overseen by the Armed Forces, in which the Peronist party was banned. The elections were won by the Intransigent Radical Civic Union (UCRI), a group from the fractured Radical Civic Union, led by Arturo Frondizi, who had established a pact with Per√≥n in order to attract the decisive Peronist vote. President Fondizi was, in turn, overthrown by the military four years later.  Coup of 29 March 1962  Jos√© Mar√≠a Guido, the only civilian dictator in the series of Argentinian coups d'√©tat. The military coup of March 29, 1962 was unique in that, after overthrowing Arturo Frondizi (of the UCRI), it was not a member of the military who took power, but rather a civilian.Carlos Floria and C√©sar Garc√≠a Belsunce: Historia Pol√≠tica de la Argentina Contempor√°nea (1880-1983). Alianza Universidad, Buenos Aires 1989 p. 184 Frondizi endured repeated protests and military insurrections during his rule, during which even the Minister of the Economy (√Ålvaro Alsogaray) opposed him. These events ended in the coup of March 29, 1962, led by General Ra√∫l Poggi. The event that led to the coup was the sweeping victory of Peronism in the elections held eleven days before and in which ten of the fourteen then-existent provinces, including the strategic Province of Buenos Aires where the textile union leader Andr√©s Framini won. Peronism had been banned by the government of the Revoluci√≥n Libertadora but Frondizi had allowed it in the elections, although he continued to prohibit Juan Per√≥n from returning to the country and from running as a candidate. Frondizi immediately moved to establish his power in the provinces in which Peronist parties had won, but the coup proved to be unstoppable. After the military uprising of March 29, 1962, President Frondizi, who had been arrested by the military and was being held at Isla Mart√≠n Garc√≠a, refused to resign saying \\"I will not commit suicide, I will not resign and I will not leave the country\\".This sentence was said by Arturo Frondizi on March 27, 1962, two days before the coup. It has become one the famous quotes of Argentinian history. El argentino dice, ONI This led to turmoil, threats and negotiations which exhausted the leaders of the insurrection who went to bed that night before formally assuming power. On the morning of March 30, the leader of the insurrection General Ra√∫l Poggi went to the Casa Rosada (where the office of the president is located) to take charge of the government and was surprised to find that there were journalists telling him that a civilian, Jos√© Mar√≠a Guido, had been sworn in president that morning in the palace of the Supreme Court.\\"While General Poggi believed he had the reigns the country within his grasp, the provisional president of the Senate, Jos√© Mar√≠a Guido, was sworn in as the President of the Republic before the Supreme Court ... The maneuver took the military powers, the union powers and the whole society be surprise\\". Guido was a senator from the UCRI who was temporarily presiding over the senate, due to the resignation of Vicepresident Alejandro G√≥mez. The night of the coup, some lawyers associated with the Supreme Court, one of whom was Horacio Oyhanarte, decided that the downfall of Frondizi had led to the case of a leaderless government and proposed to Guido that, since he was next in line of succession, he assume the presidency, which he did on the morning of March 30. The military leaders of the coup, who were surprised, skeptical and angry, ended up reluctantly accepting the situation and called Guido to the Casa Rosada to inform him that he would be recognized as the president, provided that he promised committed in writing to execute certain policies stipulated by the Armed Forces, the first of which was to annul the elections won by the Peronist factions. Guido accepted the military impositions, signed an act affirming this support and only then was he allowed to be given the title \\"president\\", but with the obligation of bringing the National Congress to a close and taking control of the provinces. Guido upheld the military orders he had been given, annulling the elections, shutting down the National Congress, reinstating the ban on Peronism, taking control of the provinces and designating a right-wing economic team which included such figures as Federico Pinedo and Jos√© Alfredo Mart√≠nez de Hoz. In 1963, there were more elections called in which Peronist factions were banned and which were won by Arturo Illia of the Radical Civic Union of the People (UCRP). After Illia, most votes were cast for None of the Above which Peronists took advantage of as a form of protest. President Illia assumed power on October 12, 1963 and would later be overthrown by a military coup on June 28, 1966.  Coup of 28 June 1966  Generals Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a, Marcelo Levingston and Alejandro Lanusse, the three successive dictators of the self-styled \\"Argentine Revolution\\". On June 28, 1966, a military uprising led by General Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a overthrew President Arturo Illia (of the UCRP). The coup gave rise to a dictatorship which called itself the \\"Argentine Revolution\\", which didn't claim to be a provisional government, as was the case with the previous coups, but rather established itself as a permanent government. At the time, there were many similar permanent military dictatorships coming to power in various Latin American countries (e.g. Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Bolivia, Paraguay, etc.) and they were analyzed in detail by the political scientist Guillermo O'Donnell who gave them the name \\"bureaucratic-authoritarian state\\" (EBA).O'Donnell, 1982 The \\"Argentine Revolution\\" issued a statute in 1966 which held a superior judicial position to the constitution and, in 1972, introduced constitutional reforms. This was another action that distinguished this dictatorship from the previous ones. In general, the dictatorship adopted a fascist-Catholic- anticommunist ideology and was supported openly by the United States as well as by European countries. The deep political and social conflict generated during the \\"Argentine Revolution\\" and the infighting between the many military divisions led to two internal coups, with three dictators succeeding each other in power: Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a (1966‚Äì1970), Marcelo Levingston (1970‚Äì1971) and Alejandro Agust√≠n Lanusse (1971‚Äì1973). On the economic front, the dictatorship handed over the Ministry of Economy to the most conservative- liberal sectors of the civilian population, which was epitomized by Adalberto Krieger Vasena, who had already served as minister under the \\"Revoluci√≥n Libertadora\\". However, during the dictatorship of Levingston, a nationalist- developmentalist group of the Armed Forces became dominant and named Aldo Ferrer of the Intransigent Radical Civic Union as Minister of the Economy. \\"Un interregno: Levingston-Ferrer\\", en Portantiero, Juan Carlos Threatened by a growing popular insurrection, the government organized an election to exit power in which Peronist parties were allowed (although Per√≥n's candidacy was banned). The election took place in 1973 and the Peronist candidate H√©ctor J. C√°mpora won with 49.53% of the votes. He assumed power on May 25, 1973. C√°mpora then resigned in order to allow free elections to take place. Juan Per√≥n won with 62% of the votes, but died less than a year after being elected. The Peronist government, which was subsequently led by the vice president Mar√≠a Estela Mart√≠nez de Per√≥n, was overthrown by a military coup in 1976.  Coup of 24 March 1976  On March 24, 1976, a new military uprising overthrew the president Mar√≠a Estela Mart√≠nez de Per√≥n and established a permanent dictatorship (a bureaucratic-authoritarian state), calling itself the \\"National Reorganization Process\\". The country was governed by a military junta made up of three members of the military, one for each faction. This junta appointed a functionary with the title \\"President\\" and with executive and legislative power. Similar to the previous dictatorship, the military junta passed a statute and two acts which were higher on the judicial hierarchy than the constitution.Escuelas ONI, El golpe: la legalizaci√≥n del terrorismo de Estado. Estatuto y Actas (The Coup: Legalization of State Terrorism. Statutes and Acts. The National Reorganization Process consisted of four successive military juntas: * 1976‚Äì1980: Jorge Rafael Videla, Emilio Eduardo Massera and Orlando Ram√≥n Agosti * 1980‚Äì1981: Roberto Eduardo Viola, Armando Lambruschini and Omar Graffigna * 1981‚Äì1982: Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri, Jorge Isaac Anaya and Basilio Lami Dozo * 1982‚Äì1983: Cristino Nicolaides, Rub√©n Franco and Augusto Jorge Hughes During these periods, the juntas appointed the military members Jorge Rafael Videla, Roberto Eduardo Viola, Leopoldo Fortunato Galtieri and Reynaldo Benito Bignone, respectively, as de facto presidents. Among these, Bignone was the only one not belonging to the junta. The National Reorganization Process began the Dirty War, a type of state terrorism which massively violated human rights and led to the disappearance of tens of thousands of opponents. Internationally, the Argentinian dictatorship, along with the human rights violations, had the active support of the government of the United States (except during the Jimmy Carter administration) and was tolerated by the European countries, the Soviet Union and the Catholic Church, without whose inaction it would have been difficult for the dictatorship to sustain itself. Also, during that time, military dictatorships were established in all the countries in the Southern Cone of South America (Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, Per√∫ and Uruguay) with the support from the US. These countries, along with the US, jointly coordinated the repression, by means of an international terrorist organization called Operation Condor. In economic matters, the dictatorship formally handed over the Ministry of the Economy to the most conservative business associations which promoted economic policies which were openly de- industrialist and neoliberal, and with a maximum expansion of the foreign debt. In 1982, the military government entered into the Falklands War against the United Kingdom in an event of which the causes continue to be unclear. The defeat inflicted in this war sparked the fall of the third military junta and, a few months later, the fourth junta called elections for October 30, 1983. Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n of the Radical Civic Union won the elections and assumed power on December 10, 1983. The military leaders were tried and convicted, many of them being imprisoned after long and complex processes. The \\"National Reorganization Process\\" was the last dictatorship. Even though there were various military insurrections between 1987 and 1990, called the \\"Carapintadas\\", none of them succeeded in toppling the democratic government.  Considerations  The coups d'√©tat in Argentina generated a series of specific political-judicial problems: * The \\"de facto government doctrine\\" of the Supreme Court; *The validity and fate of the so-called \\"decree laws\\" and other regulations passed by the military governments, once the dictatorships had ended; * The punishment of those involved in the coups. It is also possible to see an escalation in the repressive violence and a decline in respect for legal norms in each of the coups. In particular, whereas the first four coups d'√©tat (1930, 1943, 1955, 1962) were defined as \\"provisional governments\\" and acted with the intention of calling democratic elections within a short time period, the two last coups (1966 and 1976) brought to power military dictatorships which were permanent and adhered to the idea of the bureaucratic-authoritarian state, described by Guillermo O'Donnell. An important element of the coups d'√©tat in Argentina is regarding the economic policies and the attitude of the big world powers towards these policies. Firstly, the economic teams formed by the military government tended to be made of the same figures, mainly coming from the conservative-liberal sections of society, leading some to say that the Armed Forces behaved as a political party of the upper classes. The coups that took place in Argentina, especially those starting from the 1960s, were part of a widespread trend in the Latin America in which there were many military coups, most of which were supported or promoted by the United States through the operations of the School of the Americas, located in Panama and through the US doctrine of National Security. During the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution, the doctrine of de facto governments and methods of preventing them from establishing themselves in future coups d'√©tat were discussed at length. The result was the adoption of the first paragraph of article 36 of the National Constitution, also known as the \\"defense of democracy and defense of constitutional order\\": > This Constitution shall maintain its rule, even when its observance is > interrupted by acts of force against the institutional order and democratic > system. These acts will be irreparably null. Notes References * Odena, Isidro J. (1977). Libertadores y desarrollistas. Buenos Aires: La Bastilla. * O'Donnel, Guillermo (1982).

Descent  Coat of arms of the Logothetti family as used by Vladimir Logothetti originated from an old Byzantine lineage claiming an origin dating back to the Byzantine Emperor Nikephoros I Logothetes (reigned 802-811) that settled after the fall of Constantinople (1453) on the Ionian island of Zante (Zakynthos).Eug√®ne Rizo- Rangab√©, Livre d'Or de la Noblesse Ionienne, Vol. III. Zante, Maison d'Editions \\"Eleftheroudakis\\", Ath√®nes 1927, 111 In the 18th century a descendant, the officer of the Venetian Republic Giacomo (James) Conte Logothetti (1741‚Äì1802) went to the principality of Moldavia. After the annexation of the Bukovina he became an Austrian citizen. His issue played an important role in the defence of this most eastern Austrian province and were counted among the honourables of its capital Czernowitz (nowadays: Chernivtsi, –ß–µ—Ä–Ω—ñ–≤—Ü—ñ, Ukraine). Vladimir's father, Hugo I Logothetti (1801‚Äì1861) bought after his marriage with Pauline Baroness Bartenstein, a direct offspring of the chancellor of the Empress Maria-Theresia Johann Christoph von Bartenstein, in 1830 the manors Bilovice and B≈ôezolupy near the South Moravian town of Uhersk√© Hradi≈°tƒõ. He was known as Maecenas of the Czech painter Josef M√°nes(1820‚Äì1871) to whom he commissioned a portrait of Veruna ƒåudov√°. This painting is nowadays the most known genre piece of M√°nes. Vladimir has been born 4 August 1822 in Filiale Tamassy (now Tom√°≈°ovce, Luƒçenec District/Slovakia) where his father Hugo I Logothetti (1822‚Äì1892) served as Austrian army officer. He was the eldest of seven children. After one year his sister Hedwig (1823‚Äì1899) was born in Filiale Tamassy. As was usual in that period three other children died in infant age ‚Äì Bertha (*,‚Ä†1825), Lodoiska (1826‚Äì1829) and Alfred (1830‚Äì1833). The uncertain military life with ever changing posts in then poorest part of the Austrian Empire, the so-called \\"Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria\\" will have been one of the reasons of this high loss of children. In 1830 Hugo I Logothetti bought after selling his hereditary properties in the Bukovina the manors Bilovice and B≈ôezolupy near the South Moravian town of Uhersk√© Hradi≈°tƒõ. His youngest children Julia (1833‚Äì1854) and Zdenko (1835‚Äì1881) were born in Moravia. Hugo I was known as Maecenas of the Czech painter Josef M√°nes(1820‚Äì1871) to whom he commissioned a portrait of Veruna ƒåudov√°. This painting is nowadays the most known genre piece of M√°nes. Thanks to the Bucovinian money and the heritage of his wife the family was able to live the quiet life of country gentry.  Career  Portrait of Karolina Countess Logothetti n√©e Countess Nemes de Hidv√©g c1870Portrait of Vladimir Count Logothetti c1870Following his studies at a high school in Br√ºnn (now: Brno) Vladimir entered as voluntary cadet the 5th Cuirassier Regiment Graf Auersperg in Br√ºnn. Soon afterwards he was sent into combat during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848 and fought as officer of the 4th Uhlan Regiment in Upper Hungary, Transylvania and Italy. He was wounded several times and received a big number of Austrian and Russian decorations for personal courage. During the war he made acquaintance in the Transylvanian Komitat Kronstadt (now Bra≈üov/Romania) with his later spouse, female descendant from the catholic branch of important Transylvanian Hungarian, mostly Calvinist lineage. They married in 1851 (see below). Vladimir's father requested in 1831, 1832 and 1834 recognition of the traditional noble title of his lineage by the Austrian Court. Because of the bad situation of the Bucovinian records he was not able to deliver all necessary documents and thus far didn't acquire recognition of the title of Count the Logothettis used since 1703. The active participation of the Logothettis in the struggle for survival of the Empire against Hungarian, German and Italian revolts in 1848/9 was rewarded with an imperial decree of 8 July 1848 allowing Hugo I and his sons to \\"use the foreign title of Count\\". Till 1860 Vladimir was in active service as army officer, mainly in Galicia and Transylvania, where the first three children were born. When his father's health grew worse Vladimir returned to Moravia to take over the administration of the family properties. He left active service in the rank of Commander of the 1st Division of the Voluntary Uhlan Regiment, than fighting in Northern Italy. Vladimir settled in B√≠lovice, his younger brother Zdenko lived with theirin 1861 widowed mother Pauline Countess Logothetti n√©e Baroness Bartenstein (1800‚Äì1872) in B≈ôezolupy. Thanks to the big dowry of his wife Vladimir was able to modernise the B√≠lovice manor thoroughly and to build a new wing. On the c1860 photograph the new eastern wing is clearly recognisable. B√≠lovice Manor, photograph c1860 After his father's dead in 1861 Vladimir was officially declared disabled for active military service. He then took over the societz role of his father. In 1864-1865 he was mayor of B√≠lovice, in the fourth and fifth term of the Moravian Diet (1871‚Äì1877) he was member of parliament in Br√ºnn (Brno) for the party of lower nobility and took a strictly Moravian position. Registration of Vladimir Logothetti in Czech on the first sides of the journal of the Voluntary Fire Brigade of B√≠lovice For the development of the village of B√≠lovice in particular and that of Southern Moravia in general the most important deed of Vladimir was the creation in 1869 of the first Moravian Voluntary Fire Brigade. Blazes were an often returning catastrophe in that time and as an experienced military Vladimir knew how to handle with it. In 1861 and 1865 Vladimir and his brother Zdenko effectively helped to master blazes in the near village of Knƒõ≈æpole that offered them then the honorary citizenship. In 1869 Vladimir became also honorary citizen of B√≠lovice, being the first commander of the newly erected Fire Brigade. In 1873 Logothetti was one of the initiators of a new Law on Voluntary Fire Brigades in all villages counting more than 100 houses in the Moravian Diet. Vladimir spoke fluently Czech, German, Hungarian and Polish. He organised competitions between Czech and German speaking schoolboys and was active in the Uhersk√© Hradi≈°tƒõ Men's Chorus that he founded with his father. In 1863 he founded together with his brother Zdenko the first Moravian rowing club Rudenverein Moravia in Uhersk√© Hradi≈°tƒõ. Three false tries to come to a Moravian Compromise regulating the cohabitation of Czech and German speaking Moravians (in 1848, 1868 and 1871) got nowhere (the Moravian Compromise was finally made as late as in 1905) and Vladimir decided disappointed to leave active politics to return to the accustomed life of an active military. In 1877 he refused to candidate for the sixth term of the Diet and entered instead of that the Uhlan Squadron of the Royal Galician Home Guard. House of the Commander of the State Military Horse Breeding in Radautz (Bucovina) c1885 In 1882 Vladimir accepted the available function of Commander of the State Horse Breeding in Drogowitz (nu: –î—Ä–æ–≥–æ–±–∏—á/Drogobych in the Ukraine). In 1883 he changed this position for the more important one of Commander of the State Military Stud Farm in Radautz in the Bucovina. The postcard shows his official dwelling. Logothetti developed further the breeding of Carpathian Hucul ponies that were much used by the Austro-Hungarian Army for their endurance. On 7 December 1892 the 70 years old officer died due to adverse effects after a bad spill from his horse. His corpse was transferred to B√≠lovice and buried with military honour at the family cemetery. The B√≠lovice Voluntary Frire Brigade is memorating every fifth year their founder.  Family  The Logothetti children. From left to right: Rosa Countess Logothetti (1856-1941), Hugo II Count Logothetti (1852-1918), Maria Baroness Taxis n√©e Countess Logothetti (1859-1929), Alfred Count Logothetti (1853-1923). Bilovice, c1880 Vladimir Logothetti married 25 October 1851 in the Catholic Cathedral of the Transylvanian capital Klausenburg (now Cluj-Napoca/Romania) with Maria Karolina Rosalia Johanna Countess Nemes de Hidv√©g et Oltszem (1826‚Äì1906). She was an offspring from the Catholic branch of an old Transylvanian noble lineage. The family was mostly Calvinist and acquired its title from the legendary Transylvanian Prince Gabriel Bethlen. The Calvinist branch had their own pews in the stoill existing Hungarian Calvinist church in F√°rkas √∫tca (Wolfstrasse, now Strada Mihail Kog«éniceanu) in Kolozsv√°r (Cluj). The Catholic branch reconverted in 1755 with Karolina's grandfather √Ådam grof Nemes de H√≠dv√©gi (‚Ä†1766). They acquired then the title of Count (gr√≥f) and had in Klausenburg their own crypta in the Catholic University Church, the Piarist's or Academic Church. The married couple had four children: Hugo II (1852‚Äì1918), later a high Austro-Hungarian diplomat; Alfred (1853‚Äì1923), Austro-Hungarian army officer and after 1918 Romanian landowner; Rosalia (1856‚Äì1942), honorary lady of the Noble Ladies' Convent Maria Schul in Br√ºnn (Brno); and Maria (1859‚Äì1929), married Paul Lamoral Baron Taxis von Bordogna und Valnigra (1852‚Äì1901).  Orders and honours  Logothetti obtained during his active military service several decorations for personal courage: *Imperial and Royal War Medal, Austrian Empire ‚Äì 1848 *Military Merit Cross, Austrian Empire - 1849 *Knight's Cross 3rd Class with Swords of the Order of Saint Anne, Russian Empire ‚Äì 1849 *Knight of the Order of the Iron Crown, Austrian Empire ‚Äì 1861 *The St. Mary's Cross, German Knights (Austrian Branch) ‚Äì 1882  Literature  *Family records Logothetti 1734-1945, now Moravsk√Ω zemsk√Ω archiv, Brno (Czech Republic), fond G 195 *Ernst Br√ºckm√ºller, Hannes Stekl, P√©ter Han√°k, Ilona S√°rm√°ny-Parsons, B√ºrgertum in der Habsburgermonarchie: Kleinstadtb√ºrgertum in der Habsburgermonarchie 1862-1914.

Plot summary This thriller is set in Blackpool, where trained chemist Jim Harding (Douglass Montgomery) has been reduced to making a living peddling potions and medicines from a fairground stall with a former army colleague Dan Collins (Ronald Shiner). Trapped in a loveless marriage with the vulgar, shrewish and domineering harpy, Diana (Patricia Burke), a woman who harbours ambitions of breaking into showbusiness, Jim finds himself attracted to the kinder working-class Jane Thompson (Hazel Court), who sells candyfloss and ice cream at an adjacent stall. Jim does not reveal to Jane that he is married as the two fall in love and begin an affair. Diana meanwhile is engaged in a liaison of her own with the older Jerry Burns (Garry Marsh) who, she believes, will be able to help with her theatrical aspirations. Diana finds out about Jim's affair and visits Jane at home. Diana reveals Jim's married status, tries to convince Jane that Jim is a serial philanderer and that she is only the latest in a succession of young women he has targeted, and offers her cash to end the relationship. Jane refuses to be bought off and confronts Jim, who protests that he is caught in an intolerably unhappy marital situation with a selfish, unscrupulous woman. Jim then confronts Diana and demands a divorce, which she refuses out of hand. In desperation, Jim determines that the only solution is to kill Diana. Aware of her addiction to multiple medications, he uses his knowledge to concoct pills containing a lethal dose which he slips amongst her habitual supply. Then, having second thoughts, he hurries home but finds Diana dead. In a panic, he buries her body beneath the floorboards in his workshop, only to discover later when clearing up in the bedroom that the deadly pills he made up are untouched - Diana, in fact, has died of natural causes and his disposal of her body has been unnecessary and incriminating. Diana's disappearance in unexplained circumstances arouses the suspicions of the police, who come to the conclusion that all the indications are that she has been murdered by her husband. Jim attempts to flee but is tracked down and chased through the streets of the town, where the final confrontation takes place at Blackpool Tower.

In 2007‚Äì2013 it was specialized on underground coal gasification and electric power production by produced syngas. In addition to Australia, the company planned underground coal gasification projects in the United Kingdom, India, Pakistan, China, and Mongolia. History The company was established in 1994 as Pinnacle Mining NL. On 5 June 1998 it changed its name to Pinnacle VRB Limited. In 2006, the company acquired Cougar Energy Pty Ltd. After merger, the company changed name to Cougar Energy Limited on 16 February 2007. Cougar Energy had a licence agreement with Ergo Exergy Technologies for utilization of the underground coal gasification technology developed by Ergo Exergy. The main underground coal gasification pilot project developed by Cougar Energy was located near Kingaroy, Queensland. The first syngas at Kingaroy pilot plant was produced on 16 March 2010. The company planned to use produced gas at the proposed 400 MW Kingaroy Power Plant. Other projects included the underground coal gasification plants at Wandoan, Queensland (the Surat Basin), and Latrobe Valley, Victoria, in Australia and at the Thar Coal Field in Pakistan. Cougar Energy has also signed memorandums of understanding with Essar Oil and Exploration for cooperation in India and with Inner Mongolia Qi De Investment Co. Ltd. for cooperation in China. Its first commercial underground coal gasification project in Indonesia with its strategic partner PT MedcoEnergi Mining involved the development of a 30 megawatt power plant using UCG gas as feedstock. Operations Company's conventional coal assets are situated in Bowen and Surat Basins in Queensland. It develops the Mackenzie and South Burnett coal projects. Its subsidiary MRV Metals plans to produce silver and copper at Granite Belt. Incidents On 16 July 2010, the Kingaroy pilot plant was temporary shut down after traces of benzene and toluene were detected in groundwater monitoring bores. The level of hydrocarbons in the water was 95% lower than Australian drinking water guidelines. Cougar Energy initiated two legal actions in Queensland seeking damages for the closing down of the Kingaroy plant as well as orders to permit the re-opening of operations at the plant. By September 2013 the company was unable to afford the legal struggle and pleaded guilty to three counts of contravening conditions of an environmental authority and was fined A$75,000 plus A$40,000 costs.

They are a parody of the seven Road to... comedy films, starring Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, and Dorothy Lamour. These episodes revolve around Stewie Griffin and Brian on a road trip in a foreign, supernatural or science fiction setting not familiar to the show's normal location in Quahog, Rhode Island. The first, titled \\"Road to Rhode Island\\", aired on May 30, 2000, as a part of the second season. The episodes are known for featuring elaborate musical numbers, similar to the original films. As of 2016, there are eight Road to episodes. The Road to episodes contain several signature elements, including a special version of the opening sequence, custom musical cues and musical numbers, and parodies of science fiction and fantasy films. Many of the episodes are popular among television critics, and have been nominated for several awards. In 2000, \\"Road to Rhode Island\\" was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award in the \\"Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)\\" category. In 2009, \\"Road to Germany\\", along with two other episodes from the seventh season, were nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award in the \\"Outstanding Comedy Series\\" category, the first time in 48 years multiple episodes of one animated series were nominated for the same award. Episodes Segments Road to episodes typically consist of three parts following a series of theatrical or cultural- themed credits, and beginning with a segment at the Griffin family home in Quahog, Rhode Island. This segment usually establishes a conflict that Stewie and Brian must overcome by leaving Quahog and the rest of the Griffin family. For the second segment, Stewie and Brian obtain the established goal, which differs in each episode, and have included Brian reuniting with his mother in \\"Road to Rhode Island\\", Stewie finding his lost teddy bear in \\"Road to Rupert\\", and rescuing Mort Goldman, the town's pharmacist, in \\"Road to Germany\\". and being lost in different dimensions \\"Road to the Multiverse\\". Production and development The Road to episodes are a parody of the seven Road to... comedy films released between 1940 and 1962, which starred actors Bing Crosby, Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour. Family Guy creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane came up with the idea to create the episodes, being a fan of the original film series. The first Road to episode, titled \\"Road to Rhode Island\\", aired in 2000 as a part of the second season of Family Guy, and featured Brian and Stewie attempting to find Brian's mother. The episode was the first Family Guy contribution by director Dan Povenmire, and it was written by Gary Janetti, who had previously written for the show during its first and second seasons.Callaghan, p. 90 MacFarlane granted Povenmire substantial creative freedom. Povenmire recalled that MacFarlane would tell him, \\"We've got two minutes to fill. Give me some visual gags. Do whatever you want. I trust you.\\" Povenmire praised MacFarlane's management style for letting him \\"have [...] fun\\". Dan Povenmire was the director for the first three Road to episodes until he left to create his own series Phineas and Ferb. After the episode's success, including its nomination for a Primetime Emmy Award, a second episode in the Road to series was produced for the third season, titled \\"Road to Europe\\". The episode was inspired by the 1941 film Road to Morocco, including its musical number \\"(We're off on the) Road to Morocco\\", which was previously parodied by the two characters, with new lyrics, in \\"Rhode Island\\". Povenmire returned to direct the episode but this time it was written by Daniel Palladino, who was a guest-writer. The third episode in the series was not produced in the fourth season, but instead it was produced in the fifth season, titled \\"Road to Rupert\\", which followed Stewie in his attempt to relocate his teddy bear, Rupert, who was taken to Aspen, Colorado, was the last episode of the Road shows to be directed by Dan Povenmire. Povenmire left Family Guy soon after, following the conclusion of the fifth season, to create his own series, titled Phineas and Ferb, which has since been nominated for five Primetime Emmy Awards with two Emmy wins. It was written by Patrick Meighan who had written the fourth-season episode \\"8 Simple Rules for Buying My Teenage Daughter\\". alt=A man with short black hair and a black shirt in front of a microphone. His arms are crossed, and he is laughing. As a result, series regular Greg Colton, who had worked on \\"Brian Goes Back to College\\", \\"No Meals on Wheels\\", and also \\"8 Simple Rules for Buying My Teenage Daughter\\", took over Povenmire's role as director of the Road to episodes. The next installment was titled \\"Road to Germany\\", which follows Brian and Stewie going back in time to rescue their neighbor Mort Goldman from the Nazi invasion of Poland. The episode was produced for the seventh season, it aired on October 19, 2008. Meighan returned to write the episode. After reading the script aloud, Jewish executive producer David A. Goodman said, \\"I'm going to get kicked out of my temple.\\"TV Preview: Family Guy Entertainment Weekly The next Road to episode was announced at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con International in San Diego, California, on July 25, 2008. It was titled \\"Road to the Multiverse\\" and it was produced in the seventh eighth season. Though it was not originally intended to be a Road to episode, Greg Colton convinced series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane and \\"Spies Reminiscent of Us\\" director Cyndi Tang to change the episode's title from \\"Sliders\\", parodying the science fiction television series Sliders. Colton's suggestion of the new title \\"Road to the Multiverse\\" was accepted, as was altering the premise of \\"Spies Reminiscent of Us\\", the season's original Road to episode. The episode was not written by Meighan, instead it was written by Wellesley Wild who wrote \\"PTV\\". The sixth episode was announced at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, and follows Brian and Stewie on an adventure to the North Pole. It aired during the show's ninth season, and is titled \\"Road to the North Pole\\". The episode was the first Road show to be produced and broadcast in high-definition, the first to be a full hour in length, and was directed by Colton. The tenth-season episode \\"Back to the Pilot\\", originally titled \\"Road to the Pilot\\", was at first intended to be the seventh installment in the Road series, however it was changed before airing. The seventh episode was announced at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International. The episode involves Brian and Stewie teleporting to Las Vegas. Except something goes wrong with the machine and Brian and Stewie get cloned. One pair has the best possible time in Las Vegas, the other two have the worst possible time. The episode, titled \\"Roads to Vegas\\", aired as the show‚Äôs eleventh-season finale in May 2013. Reception The Road to episodes are often among the most critically acclaimed episodes of the series. In a 2009 review of \\"Road to Rhode Island\\", Ahsan Haque of IGN gave the episode a perfect score of ten out of ten, praising the episode for its \\"great writing, hilarious jokes, a catchy musical, and a story that's both hilarious and touching at the same time\\". In a subsequent review by IGN of \\"Road to Germany\\", Haque again gave the episode high marks for its \\"exciting storyline, and some hilariously offensive humor\\".Similarly, \\"Road to the Multiverse\\" was received very positively by television credits, who called the episode \\"the best of the early episodes we've seen on the series\\". In addition, \\"Road to the Multiverse\\" was the highest rated episode of the eighth season, in terms of total viewership. The episodes are generally praised by critics for the connection between Brian and Stewie. IGN stated that when Stewie and Brian are paired together for adventures in the series it becomes hilarious, also mentioning that it was great that they could learn more deeply Brian and see Stewie's transformation of character. TV Squad critic Brett Love has stated that he enjoys the episodes, especially the parts that show Stewie and Brian relationship, in his review of \\"Road to Rupert\\" he commented that Stewie and Brian's story made the episode for him. Both IGN and TV Squad have praised \\"Road to Germany\\", \\"Road to Rupert\\" and \\"Road to Rhode Island\\" for having that type of connection in their respective reviews. Though the series receives praise there are some critics that give the episodes a negative review. Alex Rocha of TV Guide was critical in her review of \\"Road to Germany\\" stating, \\"it seemed that the show has taken a slight fall back. After having great episodes the past few weeks to get this current season started on a roll, we have witnessed another average, even sub-par episode. Although Brett Love of TV Squad praised \\"Road to Rupert\\", he did state that he did not like the B-story of the episode. Although the Parents Television Council, a frequent Family Guy critic, did not name \\"Road to the Multiverse\\" its \\"Worst TV Show of the Week\\", it did refer to this episode in its negative review of the following episode, \\"Family Goy\\", due to both episodes depicting violence against a recurring Jewish character, Mort Goldman. The PTC did name a later Road to episode, \\"Road to the North Pole\\", as its \\"Worst TV Show of the Week\\" for sexually explicit humor at the episode's beginning, and graphic violence (wherein Stewie beats a homeowner to death after discovering him and Brian in the house and concluding them to be burglars). =Awards= In 2000, \\"Road to Rhode Island\\" was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award in the \\"Outstanding Animated Program (for Programming Less Than One Hour)\\" category, but ultimately lost to The Simpsons episode \\"Behind the Laughter\\". In 2009, \\"Road to Germany\\", along with two other episodes from the seventh season, were nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award in the \\"Outstanding Comedy Series\\" category, the first time in 48 years an animated series was nominated for the same award. The show lost to the NBC series 30 Rock, who had won the award in both 2007 and 2008. In 2011, \\"Road to the North Pole\\" won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Comedy or Drama Series (Half-Hour) and Animation. In IGN's top ten list of Stewie and Brian's Greatest Adventures, the Road to episodes gains each spot on the top five with \\"Road to Europe\\" in spot number five, \\"Road to Germany\\" in number four, \\"Road to Rupert\\" in number three, \\"Road to the Multiverse\\" in number two, and the first episode, \\"Road to Rhode Island\\", in the number-one spot in the list.

He was known for his contributions to the statistical theory of turbulence and theory of random processes. Yaglom spent most of his career in Russia working in various institutions, including the Institute of Theoretical Geophysics. From 1992 until his death, Yaglom worked at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a research fellow in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics. He authored several popular books in mathematics and probability, some of them with his twin brother and mathematician Isaak Yaglom. Education and career Akiva Yaglom was born on 6 March 1921 in Kharkiv, Ukraine to the family of an engineer. He had a twin brother Isaak. The family moved to Moscow when the Yaglom brothers were five years old. During their school years they were keen on mathematics. In 1938 they shared the first prize at the Moscow mathematical competition for schoolchildren. Yaglom joined Moscow State University in 1938, where he studied physics and mathematics. He completed his fourth year of diploma at the Sverdlovsk State University and received the masters in science degree in 1942. After a short period of work at the Main Geophysical Observatory, Yaglom joined the Steklov Institute of Mathematics of the USSR Academy of Sciences and completed his postgraduate studies in 1946 under the mentorship of Andrey Kolmogorov. His dissertation was \\"On the Statistical Reversibility of Brownian Motion\\". After he received his Ph.D, Yaglom was offered a job at the Lebedev Physical Institute by the future Nobel laureates Igor Tamm and Vitaly Ginzburg, but he declined the offer because he knew that the job would have required him to deal with applied problems related to the development of nuclear weapons. He joined in the Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the USSR Academy of Sciences and worked at the Laboratory of Atmospheric Turbulence and worked there for more than 45 years. In 1955, he defended his second doctoral thesis \\"The Theory of Correlation between Continuous Processes and Fields with Applications to the Problems of Statistical Exploration of Time Series and to Turbulence Theory\\". Yaglom was also a full professor in the Faculty of Probability Theory at the Mathematics and Mechanics Department of Moscow State University. In 1992, Yaglom went to the United States and joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He died in Boston, Massachusetts on 13 December 2007. Principal works Yaglom worked in many fields in applied mathematics and statistics, including the theory of random processes and the statistical theory of fluid mechanics. His initial studies on the theory of random functions were published in the lengthy 1952-article \\"Introduction to the Theory of Random Functions\\" which appeared in the journal Uspekhi Fizicheskikh Nauk. Later, this work was published in United States. His study on local structure of the acceleration field in a turbulent flow established the fact that the frequency spectrum of Lagrangian acceleration of a fluid particle in a turbulent flow is constant. This work was later independently repeated by Werner Heisenberg. Awards and honors In 1955, Yaglom received a Doctor of Science degree, the highest scientific degree in the Soviet Union, for his work on theories of stochastic processes and their application to turbulence theory. He received the American Physical Society's Otto Laporte Award in 1988 for his \\"fundamental contribution to the statistical theory of turbulence and the study of its underlying mathematical structure.\\" Yaglom received the European Geosciences Union's 2008 Lewis Fry Richardson Medal, posthumously, for his \\"eminent and pioneering contributions to the development of statistical theories of turbulence, atmospheric dynamics and diffusion, including spectral techniques, stochastic and cascade models.\\" Books authored Yaglom authored six books and about 120 research papers. Most of his materials have been published in English and many other languages. The monograph titled Statistical Fluid Mechanics, co-authored with Andrei Monin, is regarded as an encyclopedic work in the subject field. *A. M.

First we show that L' is in NP, then we will use the deterministic polynomial time machine given by P = NP to show that L is in EXP. L' can be decided in non-deterministic polynomial time as follows. Given input x', verify that it has the form x' = x1^{2^{x^c}} and reject if it does not. If it has the correct form, simulate M(x). The simulation takes non-deterministic 2^{x^c} time, which is polynomial in the size of the input, x'. So, L' is in NP. By the assumption P = NP, there is also a deterministic machine DM that decides L' in polynomial time. We can then decide L in deterministic exponential time as follows.

Television and movie appearances followed including an appearance in the final episode of the CBS television series Square Pegs in 1983.

The building was designed in the Victorian Eclectic style and features brick pier which extend above the roof line, a tower on the south side of the roof, and an arched stone entrance with carved doors. The newer Masonic Lodge adjacent to the original temple at 2312 Alameda Ave is a Spanish Renaissance building constructed in 1927, and was added to provide both an auto parking lot on the ground floor, and an elevator to all four floors of the building that had only previously been accessible by stairs. The building features decorative carvings which adorn its entrances, archways, cornices, and window surrounds, and features two lodge rooms side by side, allowing both Masons and Eastern Stars to meet at the same time, as well as a full kitchen and dining room on the top floor. The Large Lodge Room features a built-in wheel of stained glass emblems in the symbolic East, allowing the room to be quickly changed from a Blue Lodge to the emblem of other frequent renters with a turn of the wheel, as well an organ loft with trap door to a Room of Contemplation, and a passage with multiple hidden doors to the lodge rooms for use in Appendant Body ceremonies. Two of the original stained glass windows from the front of the Park Street face of the Masonic Temple were removed before its sale and are now displayed in the Small Lodge Room of the currently active Masonic Lodge. Oak Grove Lodge #215 (originally located in the Temple and then later moving to the Lodge) helped build the city's first school and the First Methodist Episcopal Church.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. With . Since 1918, the Masonic Temple has hosted numerous events from weddings to family celebrations, meetings and Conferences to product launches. It is considered one of the most intact architectural period pieces in downtown Sacramento, California. It has an room which can accommodate up to 499 guests for a sit- down meal.  The architect  The building was designed by Rudolph Herold, a Sacramento architect that contributed a number of important works to Sacramento's rapidly growing architectural stock in the early twentieth century, including notable public structures as well as private. The Masonic Temple building is approximately five stories in height (from ground level,) with a below-grade basement. The rectangular concrete structure is surfaced on the principal south and east elevations with face brick and patterned terra cotta, beneath a hipped roof parapet sheathed with clay mission tile. The surfaces on the north (alley) and west (above parking lot) are of brick without decorative terra cotta. The principal elevations are divided vertically into bays by shallow terra cotta-sheathed fluted pilasters that extend from the street up to the frieze beneath the projecting cornice. There are eight bays along 12th Street and five along J Street. The north elevation on the alley is brick, with window openings, those on the top floor extending around the building from the south and east elevations. The west elevation overlooks a parking lot, its brick surface penetrated by windows, and part of its surface decorated with a large painted mural. The rear of the building lies on the alley between I and J Streets. The west elevation contains a shallow recess or indentation to provide a light well for windows in the west wall when a former building stood adjacent to the property. The building is divided horizontally into four areas or tiers: the ground floor tier on both 12th and J Streets contains shops and shop bays, with terra cotta spandrels above the arched clerestory and standard shop windows, and angled recessed shop entries. The tall second floor tier contains tall, handsome, arched windows with stained glass insets and tympanums, enframed with detailed terra cotta moldings that emphasize the arches, keystones, and window footings.  Cherubs  Each window is centered above the \\"cupid\\" keystone in the spandrels of the arches below. The third tier is defined by a band of windows surrounding the building on three sides. The fluted pilasters end at the upper edge of the wood sash, multi-paned windows. Each group of windows in each bay is divided into three sections, the center section being the widest. The top tier, (obscuring a high interior ceiling, shallow attic space and the roof,) includes the brick frieze above the windows, terra cotta cornice, and tiled roof parapet. The separation of each of the different tiers is emphasized horizontally by a variety of sizes and shapes of decorative terra cotta trim that include egg and dart motifs, and twisting rope designs. The main entry of the Temple itself is guarded by two full size terra cotta figures representing medieval Knights Templar, mounted on either side of the segmented arched doorway. A terra cotta inscription on the doorway arch provides the name of the building. A richly decorated arched metal canopy with ornamental lamps on the outer two corners covers the entry, with its two sets of decorative metal double doors. Large clerestory windows above the doors provide light to the interior lobby. The lobby is surfaced with light-colored terra cotta shaped to resemble stone laid in courses, a grand staircase with a dramatic and voluptuous newel post and balustrade, marble steps and risers, and patterned terra cotta tile floor. Figured shields, symbolic of aspects of the brotherhood of Masonry, decorate the side walls of the lobby. The ceiling contains layers of different decorative moldings and painted stencil work. The entry lobby contains the handsome original Otis elevator, reputedly the company's first in Sacramento. It is still operational. Two door panels, with glass above and solid metal below, slide behind the same styled outer door to access the cab. Its cab still displays the original open cage frame and meshwork. The outer frame of the elevator contains a cast bronze header of the same design on each floor. The elevator is framed with cast bronze fittings and displays various decorative elements also cast in bronze.  Lodge rooms  The second floor contains four large meeting rooms with tall ceilings that open off the north-south hallway, and extend all the way from the hall to the east wall of the building. The temple meeting rooms, traditionally referred to as \\"lodge rooms\\" by the Freemasons, are outstanding in scale and ornament. The rooms are similar in layout and size, with anterooms and lockers nearest the hallway, and the large rooms beyond through large solid oak doors with inset wood trim of different colors. The rooms have decorative beamed and coffered ceilings, two arched windows on the east, and faux arched windows to appear similar, on north and south. The large expansive interior spaces themselves are decorated with beamed ceilings and a rich variety of stencil patterns, moldings and trim. The ceiling beams and coffers are very finely executed, one room containing richly gilded moldings and another finely stenciled beams, and others a combination. The rooms each contain a balcony supported by terra cotta bracketing. Each room is decorated somewhat differently, but have in common a large tall interior space with raised seating and fine wood wall paneling all around the sides. Special ceremonial chairs are located in the middle of each of the four sides, with the principal focus on the center of the east and west sides of the rooms. All wood paneling surrounding the lower half of the room and including entry doors and locker cabinets, is expertly crafted. Decorative arched stained glass windows provide a filtered exterior light to the meeting rooms from the eastern elevation. There are four small free-standing ceremonial pillars and a central stand in the middle of the rooms. Original hanging light fixtures, and wall fixtures with the symbolic sun\\" design in cast metal light the \\"stations\\" within the rooms. The third floor contains a large ballroom, a dining area, a ladies lounge area, a club room, and an office with a library. The office and club room are positioned along J Street on the uppermost floor. A tall handsome fireplace surfaced with terra cotta tile lies on the west wall of the club room. The room opens into another large adjacent room containing three large oak and slate pool tables with period light fixtures suspended above them. The wood paneled room contains special cupboards behind matched paneling, with players' personal pool cues, chalk etc. These recreational rooms all have handsome hardwood floors in excellent condition. A large, adjacent, light and airy room on the southeast corner of the building is currently being used as an office and contains tall windows on both elevations that flood the room with light.  Ballroom and auditorium  A large ballroom with many tall windows, a large wood floor, and a balcony that, with an auditorium, seats 1200, is located on the third floor. Due to modern fire code restrictions, however, the maximum occupancy of the ballroom has been set to no more than 499 people. The ballroom space is enormous and elegantly appointed. Original light fixtures with an Art Nouveau touch are affixed to auditorium walls that contain terra cotta designs with Moderne style imagery. A large arched opening leads to an area on the back northeast corner, surrounded by windows that can seat many for special programs, dinners, etc., with a kitchen adjacent for the preparation of food and meals. A reception area and restrooms lie beneath the balcony area, accessible from the auditorium floor. An upper hallway balcony provides a downward view of the entire space of the two rooms, and is as elegantly finished in wood detailing, light fixtures and finishes as is the remainder of the building. Each floor's elevator/stair lobby is handsomely appointed with bronze trim, terra cotta flooring, marble steps, and decorative cast-metal balustrades and posts. Light fixtures throughout the building are original and express various stylistic interpretations of the era. Restrooms have largely retained original integrity, with marble wainscotings and stall panels, and most of the original hardware. The topmost floor along the west wall contains mechanical equipment and a string of small rooms or \\"apartments\\" (that are currently vacant) overlooking the parking lot. The basement of the building contains a simply finished utilitarian storage room partly beneath the sidewalk, and the original boiler room that contains two large original cast-metal boilers still in operation.  Modifications  The building is essentially unaltered. Exterior modifications are primarily limited to minor modifications of ground floor commercial space, and the addition of a sign on the southeast corner of the building that appeared circa 1970. The shop entry on the north near the alley has been altered. The facade has been recessed and new windows added to accommodate an architect's office. The interior is essentially original with the following exceptions. The interior of the southernmost Temple room has been repainted from the original. The northwest corner of the ground floor lobby contains a small wood frame entry office/service enclosure that has been built within the original terra cotta walls and decor, and is removable. Acoustical panels have been attached to the walls of the auditorium above the balcony to control acoustics in the large room. The basement storage room has been refinished on the interior and doesn't reflect the age and design of the rest of the building. Historic photographs indicate that awnings of one sort or another appear to have been mounted on the building for most of its life. The current bow-frame awnings were installed circa 1980. A mural has been painted on the west wall that was exposed when an adjacent building was removed. The mural was added by the Downtown Association in about 1997 to commemorate the upcoming California state sesquicentennial.

The film was shown in competition at the 67th Venice International Film Festival. The story is loosely based on a historical incident on the Oregon Trail in 1845, in which frontier guide Stephen Meek led a wagon train on an ill-fated journey through the Oregon desert along the route later known as the Meek Cutoff in the western United States. Plot A small group of settlers travelling across the Oregon High Desert in 1845 suspect that their guide, Stephen Meek, may not know the area well enough to plot a safe and certain route. A journey that was supposed to take two weeks, via what became known as the Meek Cutoff, stretches into five. With no clear sense of where they are going, tensions rise as water and food run low. The wives look on, unable to participate in the decision making, as their husbands discuss how long they should continue to follow Meek. The dynamics of power shift when they capture a lone native and hold him in the hope he will lead them to a source of water, despite Meek's wish to kill him at once. Meek argues that the native cannot be trusted, but the group by now have no greater confidence in Meek. Later, when Meek prepares to shoot the native, Mrs. Tetherow intervenes. In the end, after the group encounter the positive sign of a tree, Meek submits to majority opinion and the group continue to follow the native.

Professor Bell is the Director of the Autonomy, Agency and Assurance Institute (3Ai), which was co-founded by the Australian National University (ANU) and CSIRO‚Äôs Data61, and a Distinguished Professor of the ANU College of Engineering and Computer Science. She holds the university's inaugural Florence Violet McKenzie Chair and is the first SRI International Engelbart Distinguished Fellow. Bell is a Senior Fellow at Intel, where she was formerly a Vice President directing the company's Corporate Sensing & Insights group. She is widely published, and holds 13 patents. Early life Daughter of renowned Australian anthropologist, Diane Bell, Genevieve Bell was born in Sydney and raised in a range of Australian communities, including Melbourne, Canberra, and in several Aboriginal Communities in the Northern Territory. Bell attended university in the United States, where she graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1990 with a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Philosophy in anthropology. Bell went on to attend Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, for graduate studies. In 1993, she earned her Master's degree from Stanford, followed by a PhD in 1998, both in anthropology. Her doctoral research focused on the Carlisle Indian Industrial School which operated in rural Pennsylvania in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Career From 1996-1998, Bell taught anthropology and Native American Studies at Stanford University, in both the Department of Anthropology and Department of Anthropological Sciences, as well as in the Continuing Studies program. She was recruited from her faculty position by Intel Corporation in 1998 to help build out their nascent social- science research competency in the advanced research and development labs. She was based at one of the company's campuses in Hillsboro, Oregon, where she worked as a cultural anthropologist studying how different cultures around the globe used technology. She and her colleagues helped re-orient Intel to a more market-inspired and experience-driven approach and she is widely credited with establishing User Experience as a recognised competency at Intel. She started Intel's first User Experience Group in 2005, as part of Intel's Digital Home Group. The company named her an Intel Fellow, their highest technical rank, in November 2008 for her work in the Digital Home Group. She rejoined the advanced research and development labs in 2010, when Intel made her the director of their newly forming User Experience Research group. This group was Intel's first fully integrated user experience research and development group; they worked on questions of big data, smart transportation, next generation image technology and ideas about fear and wonder. After steering that group to a range of successes inside and outside the company, she was made a Vice President in 2014 and Senior Fellow in 2016. Bell's impact has been recognised repeatedly outside Intel. In 2010, she was named one of the Top 25 Women in Technology to Watch by AlwaysOn and as one of the 100 Most Creative People in Business by Fast Company. In 2012, Bell was inducted to the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame and in 2013, she was named Anita Borg‚Äôs Women of Vision in Leadership. In 2014, she was included in Elle Magazine's first list of influential women in technology and also included in a new exhibit at London's Design Museum profiling 25 women from around the world. Her first book, Divining a Digital Future: Mess and Mythology in Ubiquitous Computing, written in collaboration with Paul Dourish, is an exploration of the social and cultural aspects of ubiquitous computing, with a particular focus on the disciplinary and methodological issues that have shaped the ubiquitous computing research agenda. The book was published by MIT Press in 2011. Bell was also a Thinker in Residence for South Australia from 2008-2010. Her visiting appointment was intended to help guide government policy surrounding a new national broadband initiative. Bell conducted ethnographic research and developed new innovative research methods to identify barriers to adoption and drivers around broadband uptake. Her final report, ‚ÄúGetting Connected, staying connected: exploring the role of new technology in Australian society‚Äù is available online. After 18 years as Intel‚Äôs resident anthropologist in Silicon Valley, Bell returned to Australia in 2017 as the first of five appointments under the ANU Vice-Chancellor Brian Schmidt's Entrepreneurial Fellows scheme. She is a Distinguished Professor at the ANU College of Engineering and Computer Science, where she is focusing on \\"exploring how to bring together data science, design thinking and ethnography to drive new approaches in engineering; and ... exploring the questions of what it means to be human in a data-driven economy and world\\". She is the university‚Äôs inaugural appointee of the Florence Violet McKenzie Chair, named in honour of Australia‚Äôs first female electrical engineer. In 2017, the ANU announced a major 10-year plan to drive the expansion of its program in engineering and computer science. The expansion in part was to be led by Bell as the Director of the newly founded Autonomy, Agency and Assurance Institute, to be known as the 3A Institute or 3Ai, co-founded by Australian National University and CSIRO‚Äôs Data61, Australia's largest data innovation network. The 3A Institute brings together a diverse team from a range of disciplines to tackle complex problems around artificial intelligence, data and technology and managing their impact on humanity. In October 2017, Bell presented the ABC's 2017 Boyer Lectures, interrogating what it means to be human, and Australian, in a digital world. Bell joins the list of prominent Australians selected each year by the ABC since 1959 to present the annual Boyer Lectures and stimulate a national conversation on social, cultural and political issues of contemporary Australian society. Since returning to Australia, Bell‚Äôs expertise in the field of AI development and regulation has been recognised by government and industry. At the 2016 Advance Awards, Bell received the Award for Technology Innovation and Overall 2016 Advance Global Australian Award. In October 2018, Bell was elected as a fellow of the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering (ATSE), a not-for-profit organisation which brings together leading minds in technology and engineering from academia, government and industry sectors. She was also appointed to the National Science and Technology Advisory Council among other members including Nobel Laureate and ANU Vice-Chancellor Brian Schmidt and Chair Prime Minister Scott Morrison. The council is responsible for providing expert advice to the Prime Minister and other Ministers on science and technology challenges facing Australia. In January 2019, Bell was appointed as an Independent Non-Executive Director of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia Board. On January 22, 2020, Bell was named the first Engelbart Distinguished Fellow by SRI International. The fellowship is named after Douglas C. Engelbart, a pioneer of modern computing, and recognises 'visionaries who are disrupting the traditional way we interact with and view technology' from around the globe. Shortly after, Bell was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia in the 2020 Australia Day Honours for distinguished service to education, particularly to the social sciences and cultural anthropology.

Malkin was active in several cultural and educational institutions that deal with cultural and humanistic Judaism. Biography Malkin was born in Warsaw, Poland, to a secular Jewish family. His father, Dov Ber Malkin, was a professor and theatre critic. He attended the Bund school. He moved to Mandatory Palestine at age 7, where he continued his schooling in the school system of the Histadrut labor federation. In 1950 he married the artist Felice Pazner Malkin and they had two children, Professor Irad Malkin (2004 Israel Prize Laureate) and Rabbi Sivan Malkin Maas. He died two weeks before his 93rd birthday in his Jerusalem home. Academic, literary and diplomatic career Starting in 1944, while still a student, Malkin published literary, cinema, and theater critiques, and served as the editor of On the Wall, the magazine of the Hashomer Hatzair youth movement (1944‚Äì1946). During the 1948 Arab- Israeli War, he served as a broadcasting officer for the Haganah and the IDF (1947‚Äì1948) in the underground radio station, Telem Shamir Boaz, that later became the Israel Army Radio (Galei Tzahal). Malkin lectured (in Yiddish) and was active in the Cyprus internment camps before the inmates were sent to Israel, and worked for the IDF arms procurement branch in France 1949. He directed and lectured in Pomansky College for Judaism as Culture in New York in 1951, and founded and directed a Hebrew Ulpan (language school) in the Quartier Latin in Paris in 1956. While in Paris, he also worked as assistant to the cultural attach√© at the Israeli embassy in Paris. He also participated in a lecture tour on Judaism in world literature in Australia (1960), the United States (1965), and France (1970). From 1952 to 1956, Malkin taught comparative literature studies and the Bible as literature at the Seminar HaKibbutzim teachers' college in Tel Aviv. At the same time he served as director of the repertoire department at the Habima national theater and as a drama instructor at the theater schools of Habima and of the Cameri Theater. From 1971 to 1981, he founded and directed the Mateh Yehuda community college, which employed the educational methods of Empire State College (SUNY) where students create personal tracks of study. This was adopted to conditions in Israel and to the particular requirements of working students in the Mateh Yehuda area. From 1969 to 1994, Malkin taught aesthetics, theater and film criticism at the Tel Aviv University. In 1971 he established, together with the Dean of the Faculty for New Arts, Professor Moshe Lazar, the Department for Cinema and Television at the Tel Aviv University. He also served as the university's representative in the founding team of the Tel Aviv Cinematheque, and as editor of the \\"Cinematheque Pages\\" ‚Äì film criticism essays handed out to viewers before the screening of each movie, together with Uri Klein. From 1958 to 1971, Malkin founded and directed the first community centers in Haifa, Beit Rothschild and the Beit Hagefen Jewish‚ÄìArab Center. These municipal centers were at first run by groups of friends who led the centers' dozens of social activities, including the Haifa Cinematheque, built inside Beit Rothschild. During these years Malkin also lectured in the Technion (Israel Institute of Technology) on aesthetics and rhetoric. Today Malkin serves as editor-in-chief for Free Judaism, a magazine for Judaism as a culture, which he founded in 1995 and which came out in print editions until 2004. Malkin also serves as provost at the International Institute for Humanistic Secular Judaism, based in Jerusalem (Tmura) and in Farmington Hills near Detroit in the United States (\\"Birmingham Temple\\"). The institute trains students who hold an undergraduate degree to be community leaders for secular communities and those with a master's degree or a PhD to be secular Rabbis in a four-year track of studies and work. Writings Yaakov Malkin's writings focus on humanistic ethics and the preservation of Jewish culture in a social context where literalist interpretations on the existence of God fade with each generation. Malkin, and many others, argue that to be a Jew is fundamentally a cultural identity, and not a religious one, and he often jokes that he was a descendant of many generations of devout Jews, and then goes on to list several generations of ancestors who were atheists. He further argues that whereas religiosity has been an essential part of Jewish identity, the actual belief in a god was always a matter of friction, and whether individual Jews publicly admitted it or not, he claims most Jews have always understood god as an allegory and seen Judaism as a tradition of cultural - rather than religious - significance. Given this reality, Malkin argues that an honest reflection of one's own Jewish beliefs will demonstrate to oneself that they are already a humanistic or secular Jew. Malkin perceives Judaism as a pluralistic culture, both in its secular and its religious forms. He claims that Judaism has been pluralistic since the biblical era when the culture of the Jewish people was characterized by belief in many gods, religions, rituals, beliefs, and opinions. Beginning in Hellenistic times Judaism developed a variety of cultures, beliefs, and opinions. Unlike atheist scholars such as Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris, who see atheism as the lack of belief, Malkin dedicates his writings to the humanistic beliefs shared by the non-religious community in the West generally, and among the Jewish people in particular. Malkin claims that there are no nonbelievers, but rather people who express a variety of beliefs in their day-to-day lives. These can include religious beliefs, characterized by a commitment to follow religious leaders who claim to speak in the name of a god, or nonreligious beliefs, which include the belief in humans as creators of their own paths and behaviors, whether as individuals or in society, with the goal of attaining the purpose of human life: happiness. In his books What do Secular Jews Believe?, Secular Judaism: Faith, Values, and Spirituality, and The Atheist Belief of Secular Jews, Malkin expresses his views of the humanistic belief in people that leads to national awareness and belief in the rights of all people and all nations. These beliefs lead to a rebuttal of \\"godly religions\\" that obligate the believer to keep the rules of their leaders, especially those that stand in contrast to the values of humanism and universal justice. These anti-humanistic beliefs lead, among other things, to the acceptance of secular ideological religions such as Communism and Nazism wherein believers are also obligated to obey leaders, regardless of the cost. Humanistic nonreligious beliefs include Agnostics such as Socrates, Deists such as Epicurus, Pantheists such as Spinoza or Albert Einstein, and Atheists such as John Stuart Mill and Bertrand Russell, which are all free of commitment to a religious or ideological religion. A contemporary institutionalized Jewish form of humanism is Humanistic Judaism, to which Malkin's works contributed and in which movement Malkin's daughter, Sivan Maas, is a rabbi. These humanistic nonreligious beliefs stand in contrast to postmodern relativism in that they see themselves as bound by humanistic ethical values and by the values of universal justice as articulated by Confucius and Hillel the Elder: \\"Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself\\". These values of justice lead to the moral values of equality, freedom, and human and national rights.

Construction was begun in 1908, and the building was dedicated in May 1909. It is an eight-story, Classical Revival style cubic form building faced in Indiana limestone. The building features rows of engaged Ionic order columns. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs It was jointly financed by the Indianapolis Masonic Temple Association and the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of Indiana, and was designed by the distinguished Indianapolis architectural firm of Rubush and Hunter. The Indianapolis Masonic Temple is the statewide headquarters of the Grand Lodge F&AM; of Indiana, and home to numerous individual Masonic lodges and associated groups. It is also the location of the Masonic Library and Museum of Indiana; the Indiana Masonic Home Foundation; Indiana DeMolay, and many more. The building features an auditorium, two stages, a large dining hall and catering kitchen, a ballroom, and seven large lodge rooms designed for a variety of ceremonial and social purposes.  History  The Freemasons of Indianapolis had previously built two other jointly owned temples in Indianapolis in partnership with the Grand Lodge. Those stood on the southeast corner of Washington Street and Capitol Avenue (formerly Tennessee Street) and diagonally across from the Indiana Statehouse. The Hyatt Regency Indianapolis Hotel currently stands at that site. The current Temple is the third such building in Indianapolis. = Indianapolis Masonic Hall of 1850 = The first Indianapolis Masonic Hall, on the southeast corner of Washington Street and Capitol Avenue (then Tennessee Street), was built in 1850 and demolished in 1873. The first joint Masonic temple in the city, a colonnaded Greek Revival hall, was built in 1850. The building was the site of the Indiana Constitutional Convention of 1850 that met to draft a new state constitution. The state government rented the Masonic temple for the gathering because the House of Representative in the Indiana Statehouse was too small to accommodate the 150 convention delegates. A reporter for the Locomotive Magazine sardonically described the convention scene on February l, 1851: Along with its intended role as a meeting and ceremonial space for the city's Freemasons, the hall's main auditorium became the first large-scale venue in the city for speakers, entertainers, debates and presentations. Despite Freemasonry's strict rules forbidding the discussion of politics in their meetings, such restrictions did not extend to the use of their auditorium. In 1853, the Masonic Hall hosted fiery demonstrations and presentations by the city's black leaders and white anti- slavery speakers in opposition to the Fugitive Slave Act. The events were touched off by charges leveled against John Freeman, an Indianapolis house painter wrongfully accused of being a runaway slave. On September 19, 1859, Abraham Lincoln gave a speech at the Temple (the second of three he ultimately made in Indianapolis during his career). He opened his political remarks by recalling his famous words: ‚ÄúThis government cannot endure permanently, half slave and half free; that a house divided against itself cannot stand.‚Äù = Indianapolis Masonic Hall of 1875 = The second Indianapolis Masonic Hall was built in 1875 and consumed by fire in 1905. The short addition at the rear, called the Indiana Freemasons Hall, was hastily added as large auditorium. The first temple suffered from serious construction defects and was demolished in 1873. It was replaced by an imposing red-brick Romanesque structure on the same corner, officially opened in 1875. The second temple was designed with ample rental space on the first two floors to generate income. Renters would eventually include a cleaners and a Turkish bath, along with several offices. There were ceremonial and social rooms for five Masonic lodges on the upper floors. However, late in the design process it was noted with great alarm by the state's Masons that the architects had neglected to create an appropriately large meeting hall for the annual meetings of hundreds of lodge officers each year. The Grand Lodge was forced to hurriedly purchase an adjoining lot immediately to the south to attach an architecturally incongruous assembly hall to the backside of the building. After an initial estimate of under $70,000, the total cost of the project was $120,000. The embarrassing errors and cost overruns, combined with the great economic Panic of 1873 nearly bankrupted the Grand Lodge. = Indianapolis Masonic Temple of 1909 = The Masons and the economy eventually rebounded, and by 1900 there were eight Indianapolis Masonic lodges and numerous appendant groups that had filled the second building beyond its designed capacity. Following a devastating fire in the second temple in 1905, it was determined that a new building at a different location needed to be constructed. Elias J. Jacoby, an attorney and insurance executive, and a very prominent Mason, helped found the Indianapolis Masonic Temple Association and chaired its building committee. The committee hired the firm of Rubush & Hunter, which has been called \\"the premier Indianapolis architectural firm of the early 20th Century\\", to design the new structure. The firm, headed by Indiana natives Preston C. Rubush and Edgar O. Hunter, were largely responsible for the look of Indianapolis during this period of the city's history, at the height of the City Beautiful movement. They constructed the new building from Bedford limestone in the Greek-Ionic style. It is over tall and measures at ground level. The original cost of construction was $531,000. Indiana Freemasons Hall auditorium in the Indianapolis Masonic Temple On the first floor is what was originally an 1100-seat auditorium which, due to neglect after the 1960s, lay virtually unused for over forty years until its renovation in 2005. During its heyday, the Hall hosted speakers, concerts, political candidates from all parties, debates, movies, and even new citizen swearing-in ceremonies. By 1963, Indiana Masons had outgrown the auditorium and moved their annual meetings across the street into the larger (and air-conditioned) Indianapolis Scottish Rite Cathedral. Because of seating modifications and the closure of the balcony, the Hall's current capacity has been reduced to about 600. Also on the first floor is the headquarters of the Grand Lodge of Indiana, and the Indiana Masonic Home Foundation. A large banquet hall is located on second floor and is available for wedding receptions, business meetings and other events. The Masonic Library and Museum of Indiana, once housed at Compass Park in Franklin, Indiana, is located on the fifth floor of the Temple building and is open to the public at irregular hours. The Egyptian-revival Red Cross Room in the Indianapolis Masonic Temple While many of the Masonic lodge meeting rooms look very similar, the seventh floor is dedicated to the York Rite appendant organizations. It features a large Knights Templar asylum with gallery seating areas and open floorspace for marching in formation; an arched Royal Arch Chapter Room and 'secret vault' area; and a small Red Cross Room that is decorated in a unique Egyptian revival motif with murals and custom furniture original to the building. At the time of its construction the Temple held seven separate pipe organs, of which six survive and remain operable. In 1919, there were 1,174 meetings held in the Temple. More than 41,000 meals were served that year, with thirty-six banquets held in December alone. During World War II, the south end of the basement was converted for use as a Masonic Service Club, a social and recreational area for members of the armed forces, with pool tables, a snack bar, writing desks, and a library of national newspapers‚Äìsimilar to a USO club. Area Masons, women from the auxiliary groups like the Order of the Eastern Star, and teenaged members of the Masonic youth groups like Rainbow Girls and Jobs Daughters volunteered to staff the club 24 hours a day. Even the rooftop was designed for active use. Originally covered in tile, the rooftop was used for drill team practice by the Knights Templar, as well as open air parties and dinners with a view of the city. Today it is largely covered with cell phone towers and is largely inaccessible. The Temple was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. It is also listed in the Indiana Register of Historic Sites and Structures.

Lindsley was murdered with a machete by an unknown assailant on the front steps of her home in St. Augustine, Florida. Her murder remains unsolved. Early life Lindsley was born to a wealthy family in Toledo, Ohio and was raised on the Isle of Pines, an island possession of Cuba in the Caribbean Sea. She spent 20 years in New York as a model, chorus line dancer and hostess on Bud Collyer's television game show \\"Winner Take All\\". She was at one time engaged to Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr., who died while on active duty during World War II. She made an unsuccessful bid for state senator and had plans to run for a seat on the St. Johns County, Florida Commission. She married a former mayor of St. Augustine, James \\"Jinx\\" Lindsley, a successful real estate agent, four months prior to her murder.Giunta, Peter. \\"A Recurring Horror\\", St. Augustine.com (St. Augustine Record) Despite being newly married, they resided in different homes; she lived at 124 Marine Street on the Matanzas River, while he alternatively used the historic Lindsley House at 214 St. George Street and another on Lew Boulevard on Anastasia Island. Death Lindsley had been in an ongoing feud with Alan Griffin Stanford Jr., her neighbor at 126 Marine Street. One of the concerns was the six stray dogs she took in that barked incessantly. In a transcript of an October 1973 county meeting, one of the commissioners had remarked, \\"I am aware you are a neighbor of the Stanfords and that y'all have had neighbor problems,\\" to which Lindsley answered, \\"That's true. (But) my life has been threatened. You mention personal things, he threatened my life.\\" Between 5:30 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. on January 23, 1974, Lindsley was attacked on the front steps of her home at 124 Marine Street by a white middle-aged male wearing a white dress shirt and dark dress pants. According to medical examiner Dr. Arthur Schwartz, who performed the autopsy, she was struck nine times by the machete on her hand, arm and in the head. One of her fingers was severed and she was nearly decapitated. The only thing missing from her house was a pet Blue jay, whose cage was found smashed. Toward the end of the attack, an 18-year-old neighbor, Locke McCormick, heard the sounds of a commotion and went outside to look. He allegedly shouted to his mother that \\"Mr. Stanford is hitting Mrs. Ponsell.\\" After the perpetrator left, the McCormicks went next door and saw Lindsley lying in a pool of blood on her porch and called 911. Stanford was indicted, where he pled innocent and brought to trial; after two hours of jury deliberation, he was acquitted. Critics accused the police of botching the investigation and tainting evidence. In media In 1998 Bloody Sunset in St. Augustine, a work of fiction intermixed with facts from the case, was locally published by Jim Mast and Nancy Powell, friends of Lindsley. In 2000, the cable channel A&E; aired an hour-long documentary on the case in its City Confidential series titled St. Augustine: The Socialite and the Politician. In April 2019 the case was covered on the popular online true crime show BuzzFeed Unsolved. Second attack On November 3, 1974, Lindsley's friend and neighbor Frances Bemis went out for her evening walk and never returned. Her body was found the next day in a vacant lot on the corner of Bridge and Marine streets with her skull crushed. Having been a professional newspaper writer, amongst other professions, she may have been gathering material for a book on Lindsley's murder; she had alluded to having certain information. Her murder, like Lindsley's, was never solved.

In October 1931 he transferred to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where his instructors included Henry McCarter, Daniel Garber, and Francis Speight.Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts 1972. From 1932 to 1966 he exhibited regularly at the Pennsylvania Academy's Annual Exhibitions. In 1935 he married Lila Hill, a sculptor who had also studied at the Academy. Stuempfig was a prolific painter whose works number over 1500. His paintings sold steadily; purchasers from his first solo show in New York in 1943 included the Whitney Museum and the Museum of Modern Art.Salpeter 1948. He painted figure compositions, landscapes and architectural subjects, still lifes, and portraits; all in a style of romantic realism that fell outside the artistic mainstream of his time. Robert Sturgis Ingersoll has written of him: > A layman's chat with him would constitute a lesson in late 16th century and > early 17th century Italian art. His heroes were Caravaggio, Degas and > Eakins. One would risk acrimonious rebuttal if making a disparaging remark > with respect to any one of them and earn a more violent rebuttal to a remark > in praise of American Expressionism. From 1948‚Äì1970 he taught composition and drawing at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. He died in Ocean City, New Jersey at the home of his aunt, on November 29, 1970.

Herbert, i.412), and practised for some time in London in Fleet Street, at the Golden Cross by Fleet Bridge. There, in 1527, he printed his own translation of ‚ÄòThe vertuose boke of Distyllacion of the waters of all maner of Herbes by Jherom Bruynswyke, and now newly translate out of Duyche,‚Äô sm. folio.

It is this work which has given Andrewe the credit of producing an edition of the Grete Herball in 1527. He also printed, without a date, ‚ÄòThe myrrour & dyscrypcion of the World,‚Äô folio, a reproduction of the 1481 text of Caxton, with some of the original wood blocks. Herbert (Typ.

It is part of the so- called \\"Green Belt\\" around Moscow. An $8 billion high speed road, the Moscow‚ÄìSaint Petersburg motorway (M11), has been proposed to go through the forest to connect Moscow and Saint Petersburg. For this purpose, part of the forest would have been cut down. The construction triggered large protests, which turned violent in July, 2010. On 26 August, President Dmitry Medvedev ordered the construction to be halted.  Protests over planned highway  =History of opposition= The M11, a new toll motorway, was proposed to go through the forest. The roadway would connect Moscow and Saint Petersburg. The proposed road attracted local and international opposition due to deforestation and other environmental issues. The forest's fauna includes foxes, elk, wild boars and a number of species of insects and plants considered endangered. Logging in the forest started on 14 July 2010, and activists immediately clashed with the construction workers. The activists included local people and a group called \\"Ecological Defense of the Moscow Region\\", along with Greenpeace Russia, and the \\"Left Front\\" civil movement. On 15 July 2010, environmentalists started to maintain a round-the-clock vigil to prevent the trees from being cut down. On July 28, 2010, dozens of anarchists and antifascists stormed government offices in Khimki. Windows were broken and the assailants left a graffiti with the text \\"Save the Russian Forest.\\" On 22 August, 2,000 activists attended a concert that was held to protest the construction. On 22 August, two opposition leaders and a human rights activist who were participating in rallies marking the National Flag Day of Russia were detained. They claimed that they were detained \\"to prevent the action in defense of the Khimki Forest.\\" Russia's Supreme Court has ruled that the construction of the highway is not illegal. The activists' Khimki Forest Defense movement has filed a suit with the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. In August, the country's largest political party, United Russia asked the President to stop the construction. Reuters analysts speculated the move was an attempt by the party to \\"pre-empt wider protest actions\\" which could have lowered the high popularity enjoyed by the Kremlin and the party. In late August, rock star Bono of the group U2, while his band was on tour in Russia, took a high-profile stand against the highway construction. Asking Russian rock star Yuri Shevchuk, an outspoken critic of the highway's planned route, who had made headlines confronting Vladimir Putin in a face-to-face meeting in May, to join him on stage at a concert, Bono and Shevchuk sang a Bob Dylan tune (Knockin' on Heaven's Door) in front of 60,000 people. Bono said in an interview that he regretted not raising the issue in his own meeting with the president. =Attacks= Various protesters and journalists have been attacked and intimidated by both the police and unknown assailants. Three journalists - Anatoliy Adamchuk from Zhukovskiye Vesti, Mikhail Beketov from Khimkinskaya Pravda and Oleg Kashin from KommersantRussia tries injured editor as fears for media grow, BBC \\\\- have been beaten up in what are thought to be attacks linked to their coverage of the protests.Russian president vows action after reporters attacked, BBC =President Medvedev suspends the project= On 26 August 2010, President Dmitry Medvedev ordered the construction of the highway to be halted, and asked for a period of further discussion. :\\"Taking into account the amount of appeals [against the construction], I have made a decision...to suspend the implementation of the decree on the construction of the toll highway and to hold additional public and expert discussions.\\" One of the activists who had fought to protect the forest hailed the President's decision as \\"victory\\" for the activists. City district prefect and former environmental official Oleg Mitvol has stated that the motorway could be built through another area in the north of the capital. When he presented his idea to Mayor of Moscow Yuri Luzhkov, the mayor supported it. Aleksey Knizhnikov of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) believes that if the logging was stopped right now, the forest would recover in a decade. The role of the French multinational Vinci S.A. The French multinational Vinci jointly with some individuals from Lebanon and Syria owns 50% of the North-West Concession Company, the concessionaire of the project. Soon after the President of Russia Mr. Medvedev put a halt on construction under pressure of the civil protests in August, 2010, Mr. Emanuel Quidet of the French Chamber of Commerce in Russia intervened, asking Mr. Medvedev to resume works as soon as possible. During the discussion, representatives of Vinci threatened Russian Government with 4 billion rubles (about 100 million euro) of compensations in case of a longer delay for the change of the routing. The Movement to Defend Khimki Forest together with the Bankwatch CEE and through the UN Global Compact has written several letters to the executive board of Vinci, indicating environmental damage to the forest and human rights abuses, connected with the project. Vinci was asked to start discussion about changing the route and to intervene with the Russian authorities, but it refused to cooperate, claiming that it had no power to change the route, chosen by the Russian authorities, and denying any connection between the violence and the project.

Soon after Simon's mother dies from overdosing on pills, after being diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer, he discovers that he has testicular cancer and must undergo surgery and chemotherapy. The night of his surgery, Hanna has a sexual encounter with a man called Adam, and Simon learns that he had fathered a child seventeen years earlier, although the woman opted for an abortion. Simon, who had assumed that either he or Hanna was infertile, is assured that he should still be able to have children after his surgery. During his recovery, Simon and Hanna decide to finally wed. Shortly beforehand, Simon encounters Adam at the pool and begins an affair with him as well. The couple's separate affairs lead to greater happiness and sexual desire felt for one another. Adam, unaware that his two lovers are involved, develops feelings for them both. The affairs are divulged soon after Hanna discovers that she is pregnant; because she was sleeping with both Adam and Simon at the time of conception, she does not know the identity of the father.

It is a -story, six-bay-wide by two-bay-deep stone dwelling surmounted by a steep gable roof. It was built in two sections during the late 18th century and early 19th century and features an overlay of Greek Revival details. Also on the property is a contributing stone smokehouse. See also: It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.  Location & Description  Rushmore Farm is located in the town of Athens, near the eastern border of Greene County, The ninety-five acre farm is a long and narrow parcel of land generally bordered by two major north-south transportation features: US 9W on the west and the Conrail railroad tracks on the east. Both of these routes parallel the Hudson River, which is east of the tracks. The nominated property is characterized by woodland, mature trees, a pond, and a landscaped yard. Its highest elevation is along the western boundary, while the land drops off sharply to the east, toward the flats along the river. To the north/northeast of the farm are the Athens Flats; known to be a Native American area used for feeding and watering animals on the way to the Hudson River from the flint ridge located to the northwest/west of the house. A small portion of the Athens Flats is located on this property. The Rushmore property was once much larger, and the nominated ninety-five acre parcel has been defined by numerous land transactions from the late 18th century until the 1970s, when it reached its current size. Much of the original acreage outside the nomination boundary is still actively farmed. Land in the Athens Flats too wet for farming remains uncultivated. Some of the former property along US 9W has been divided off and developed with residences and commercial properties. An easement to the New York Power and Light Company (now National Grid) cuts through the northeast comer of the property. The Rushmore graveyard, a non-contiguous parcel owned by Greene County, is located south of the property along the edge of US 9W and is separated from the farm by intermediate development. The cemetery is not included in this nomination. The entrance to the property is a long gravel driveway from US 9W leading to the building complex, which is located in a small landscaped clearing. Buildings include a stone farmhouse, an early stone smokehouse, a non-historic wood-frame garage, and a small non-historic shed built on the footprint of an earlier milk house. In the fields to the southwest of the house are foundations of a silo and a barn. The latter have not been evaluated for their archeological potential. There is a large stand of locust trees east of the house. The nomination includes two contributing and two non-contributing features. The foundations have not been counted. = The Rushmore Farm House = The Rushmore farmhouse is a -story, six-bay-wide by two-bay-deep stone residence surmounted by a steeply pitched gable roof. Interior stone chimneys pierce the gable ends. The residence, which faces south, was built in two sections, in the late 18th century and early 19th century, and features an overlay of Greek Revival period decoration. The house was built into the side of a hill so that the southeast face of the basement is exposed. The building was constructed of uncoursed fieldstone with a mortar joint that was tooled to obtain a distinctive V-shaped pattern. The fa√ßade appears to have been whitewashed at one time and there are large areas where the original mortar has been replaced with Portland cement. The house features a standing-seam metal roof, overhanging eaves, a projecting wood cornice with returns, and a wide wooden frieze. Two gabled dormers on the south elevation were added at a later, unknown date. The western half of the house was built first and apparently dates to the last quarter of the 18th century. The original structure was three bays wide with a center entrance. A seam near the center of the north and south walls denotes the end of the original house. The eastern half, which was built in the early 19th century, is three bays wide with an entrance in its westernmost bay. This section also features a basement kitchen, with access from underneath the front porch. A full-width porch apparently added in the mid-19th century is supported by flat, paneled posts and features a wood railing. A wood stair leads to the entrance to the west section. At one time part of the porch was screened in; however, all of the screening has been removed. The exposed section of the basement is concealed by lattice screening. The west half of the facade features a wide, wood-panel door within a wood enframement flanked by double-hung, eight-over-twelve wood- frame windows. In the east section, a similar door has a single sidelight to the east and two double-hung, twelve-over-twelve wood-frame windows in the easternmost bays. The east and west elevations each feature one window in the south bay of the first story and two windows in the half story. On the west (side) elevation, the first story contains a double-hung, two-over-two wood- frame window, the upper story windows are smaller but have the same configuration. On the east (side) elevation, the first story features a double-hung, twelve-over-twelve wood-frame window that matches the fa√ßade windows in this section. Half story windows on the east elevation are double hung with six-over-six sash. There is a small basement window on this elevation. A large vertical crack, which has been repaired, runs through east wall, from the roof to the ground, following the location of the interior chimney. Fenestration on the rear (north) elevation is irregular. The western (original) half of the building contains two widely spaced, double-hung, eight-over-eight wood-frame windows on the first story and one small rectangular eight-pane window centered in the half story. The eastern half features a single wood-panel door and a double-hung, twelve-over-twelve wood- frame window on the first story and a small rectangular six-pane wood-frame window above. There is also a small basement window on the east side. The interior plan of the original (western) section has been altered since its original construction. The first floor is divided into four spaces, with a living room occupying the western two-thirds and a kitchen, laundry, and half- bath in the eastern third. An enclosed staircase is located along the west wall of the living room, along with built-in cabinets and a rebuilt fireplace with a wide wooden mantel and a narrow shelf. The trim around the fireplace and windows appears to be original and is in keeping with a late 18th-century construction date; windows contain original glass. The western room features exposed small-dimensioned hand-hewn beams running north-south and a single large summer beam running east-west. The latter was added in the 1970s to provide structural support and probably compensated for the loss of an original east-west that would have divided the room into two spaces, with the larger, southern room serving as the kitchen and the smaller, northern room containing the entrance to the enclosed stair. The original beams in both rooms would have been concealed by a plaster ceiling. Finishes and trim in the kitchen and laundry are similar to those in the living room. It is possible that a chimney was originally located on the east wall of the original house; this would have been removed when the house was enlarged, and there is no evidence of it today. The eastern section of the first floor is divided into a hall and \\"best room\\" (now the dining room), which may be the original configuration. The hall contains an enclosed stair leading to the upper floor and a stairway to the basement, which was the location of the kitchen. There is also a door to the exterior at the northern end of the hall. The eastern wall of the dining room features a fireplace and a built-in hutch; the latter is a contemporary addition. Documentation reveals that this room contained a Franklin stove in the 1820s; however, the fireplace has since been rebuilt. This room also features exposed hand-hewn beams; however, they are significantly larger than those in the west room and the ceiling itself is higher. As in the western section of the house, the ceiling in this room was originally plastered. All windows and trim on the main floor of this section appear original, as does the mantel. The first floor features wide plank hardwood floors throughout. Changes other than those noted include replacement of original hardware and possibly some of the doors. On the upper floor, the western half is now divided into two bedrooms, one with an attached bath. The eastern section is divided into an office with bath (in the hall over the stairs) and a single large bedroom with fireplace. The latter was originally divided into two small bedrooms. Ceilings in the eastern section have been removed, exposing the rafters. Access to the attic in the western section is through a hatch in the office area. Hewn rafters in this section are pegged with no ridge pole and show scribe marks, consistent with the late 18th century construction date. Access to the basement kitchen is from the hall in the eastern section of the house and from an exterior door on the south elevation. A beehive oven survives on the east wall; however, the fireplace has been rebuilt. The basement on the west side of the house is unfinished; however log joists are not typical and may have been later replacements. The Rushmore farmhouse is a good representative example of late 18th century to early 19th century stone residential architecture in Greene County. Original forms and many original materials survive or are clearly discernible. Spatial divisions and room uses have changed over time and help to illustrate how the building was adapted to meet the needs of its occupants over more than a century. = Smokehouse = The smokehouse, located northeast of the residence, is a tall stone structure surmounted by a wood-shingle gable roof with overhanging eaves. There is a vertical-board wood door with iron hardware in the south wall and small rectangular openings in the gables. The smokehouse is believed to date to the late 18th century or early 19th century. = Garage = The three-car garage, constructed in 1980, is a rectangular (20' by 32') wood-frame building with a standing-seem metal gable roof surmounted by a small cupola with weathervane. It sits on a concrete slab and features novelty siding. = Shed = The shed is a small, square (8' by 8'), wood-frame building with novelty siding and a gable roof with overhanging eaves. There is a vertical-board wood door in the north elevation and a small vent in the gable. The shed occupies the site of an original milk house.  Brief History  The Rushmore farmhouse is architecturally significant as a distinctive example of a vernacular stone farmhouse. The six-by-two-bay, -story building was constructed in two stages by Jeremiah Rushmore; a descendant of English Quakers from Long Island, whose family owned the property for more than a century. Although the exact building date is not known, tax records and construction details indicate a late 18th-century construction date or the earlier (western) half, while Rushmore's will confirms that the later (eastern) addition was constructed before his death in 1828. The building underwent renovations in the late 1830s or early 1840s, which probably account for the Greek Revival period trim and porch, dormers were added at a later date. The house was constructed of uncoursed fieldstone and surmounted by a steeply pitched gable roof pierced by interior end chimneys. The building's stone construction and long, low form with steep gables are typical of Dutch, German, and English settlement groups in the late 18th century; however, its specific framing method and spatial divisions are indicative of English building practices and may reflect the family's Long Island origins. These differences are particularly evident in the interior of the older section, which features a jambed fireplace, more and smaller floor joists, and, originally, a compact arrangement of small rooms, all features more common to houses built by those of English descent. When the house was doubled in size in the first quarter of the 19th century, the new eastern section was built with a basement kitchen and hall and \\"best room\\" plan on the first floor, probably reflecting Jeremiah Rushmore's increased wealth and the needs of a larger family. It is interesting that Rushmore's will (1826, codicil 1828) specified how the spaces in the expanded house would be used after his death. He ensured that his widow and unmarried daughter would remain in the house, according them the use of the first-floor best room and two second-floor bedrooms in the new section. At the same time, his daughter was forbidden to enter the old section, now home to her brother Richard and his family. The basement kitchen was apparently accessible to all. Despite a number of changes, the house provides important evidence of regional architecture during the early years of the American republic and illustrates the evolution of a small farm house over time to meet the needs of a changing family. The Rushmore property was a working farm with large orchards for over a century. Although subdivided over time, the nominated ninety-five acre property retains an open setting and several agricultural dependencies, including an original stone smokehouse and the remains of a barn and silo, which burned in the 1960s.  Rushmore Family  The first Thomas Rushmore, a Welsh immigrant, arrived in Long Island in 1648. He married Martha Hicks and had four children, including a son Thomas, born c1655. The younger Thomas Rushmore married Sarah (last name unknown) around 1693‚Äì95. Their son, also Thomas, was born in 1693 in Hempstead. This Thomas married twice. His first marriage, c1715, to Anneke Hendrickson, a Quaker, produced seven children: Martha (b. 1716), Jacob (b. 1720), Sarah (b. 1722), Thomas (b.I724), Silas (b. 1727), Stephen (b. 1731), and Isaac (b.1733 ). Thomas Rushmore's son Silas is believed to be the Silas Rushmore listed in Greene County history. Silas married Phebe Titus in 1753. The pair had six children: Martha (b. 1754), Samuel (b. 1761), Jacob (b. 1755), Jeremiah (1765‚Äì1828), Sarah (no date) and Mary (no date), all of whom were born on Long Island. It is unclear when the Rushmores arrived in what was then Albany County; however, Silas Rushmore, along with Thomas, Jeremiah, and Jacob, who appear to be relatives (brothers or sons), appears in tax documents for the area that became Greene County beginning in 1787. According to deeds located in the Greene County Clerk's office, Silas bought and sold numerous parcels of land in the late 18th century and early 19th century. The Rushmores also owned a grist mill, originally known as the Van Vechten Mill, in the town of Catskill, on the Catskill Creek. A Quaker marriage record from the Nine Partners Monthly Meeting, Dutchess, N.Y. for Thomas Rushmore, son of Silas and Phebe, to Abigail Griffin in 1797 suggests that the Rushmore family was living in the Hudson Valley by this date. Silas Rushmore's son Jeremiah was born in Hempstead, Long Island in 1765. He married Martha Roby and they had three children: Richard (1787‚Äì1837), Anna (b. 1804) and Morris (b. c1814). Between 1790 and 1799, census records list both Silas and Jeremiah Rushmore as heads of households with land in Athens; however, it is unclear which of them purchased the nominated property. Jeremiah Rushmore is the probable builder and first documented occupant of the nominated house. Tax records from 1799 show that Jeremiah Rushmore owned a house and land in the town of Catskill (Athens was not a separate town until 1805) valued at 1,560 pounds and personal wealth of 172 pounds. The 1801 Tax Assessment also lists Jeremiah as owning a house and lands in Catskill with a personal estate value of 3,000 pounds. An article in the Catskill Recorder reporting the death of one of Jeremiah Rushmore's workers in September 1806 documents his ownership of the nominated house by that date. Although another article reported that the house and two hundred acres of land, including one hundred acres of meadow, were for sale in 1811, Jeremiah purchased an additional in 1812 and retained ownership until his death, when the property passed to his son Richard in 1813, another article described the Rushmore property as including three orchards with over three hundred trees. Jeremiah Rushmore died 28 October 1828. His will and codicil, dated 1826 and 1828, respectively, and probated in November 1828, stipulated that his son Morris was to inherit the farm he was living on in Coxsackie and that Richard would inherit the Athens farm. The will confirms that the second half of the house had been constructed before Jeremiah's death, in that it specified that his wife, Martha, and unmarried daughter, Anna, could continue to live in his \\"new house\\" and use the upper (first floor) room and two bedrooms upstairs. In the codicil Rushmore specified that his daughter was not permitted to enter the old house. Martha Rushmore was permitted to use the Franklin stove in the upper room and Richard was directed to provide firewood for Martha and Anna. Jeremiah was very wealthy, and at his death an inventory of his possessions showed that he had almost $300 along with forty-one linen sheets. His widow, Martha, died on 21 February 1830. Richard Rushmore married Deborah Wilson (date unknown) and the couple had nine children: Thomas Lembuck (b. 1810), Delanco (no dates), Mary E. (1815‚Äì1865), Solon (1816‚Äì1870), infant son (1817‚Äì1821), James (1818‚Äì1821), Erasmus (1823‚Äì1886), Martha Ann (1828‚Äì1831), and Laban Coleman (1830‚Äì1909). After her husband's death on 3 January 1837, Deborah and her minor children continued to operate the farm. The New York State Agricultural Census for 1855 reported that the farm consisted of two hundred acres, produced five hundred pounds of butter, and had apple orchards. The Rushmore property appears on local maps in 1856 and 1867. There was also a cider mill located on the property at this time, and the family continued to own and operate the Catskill mill. Between 1837 and 1843, a number of improvements were made on the farm. These were recorded in a document written 11 March 1843 by George Griffin, Jr. 'at the request of my neighbors' to determine an 'estimate of the amount expended in permanent improvements of the farm.' George Griffin owned a farm that bordered the Rushmore Farm, Griffin recorded labor and material costs as well as income earned from 1837‚Äì1843. Repairs to the house include labor costs for a carpenter and mason and for material and labor for work on the kitchen and the east room. Work on the farm buildings included construction of a wood house and root cellar, repairs to the corn house and cider mill, milk room, hog press and barn, hay press and barn, and lower barn, as well as repairs to the stone walls and board fence on the property. Richard and Deborah's oldest son, Erasmus (1823‚Äì1886), never married and worked on the family farm until his death. He never owned the property, however, which continued in his mother's ownership until it passed to his brother Laban. Laban Coleman Rushmore (1830‚Äì1909) lived in the town of Catskill and ran the mill, as documented by local census documents for the years 1869 and 1873. Before and after these years, census records show him living on the farm with his mother, his wife, and his daughter, Ella. Laban married twice. His first marriage was to Elvira Dean, a descendant of the Salisbury family, one of the area's settling families, on her mother's side. Elvira's mother, Eleanor Salisbury Dean, lived on the farm with Laban and Elvira at the end of her life, Elvira Dean Rushmore died in 1877 at the age of fifty-five, and Laban then married Sallie Ann (Sarah Ann) Stone. Sallie Ann Stone Rushmore continued to live on the farm after her husband's death until 1912, when she sold it to Stephen Harrison and moved into the village of Athens, where she lived until her death in 1924. = Later Owners = The Rushmore property has had nine owners since it has passed out of the Rushmore family in 1912. The Stewarts purchased the farm, then containing , from Stephen Harrison in 1914. A 1930 tax assessment shows the property consisting of , with an assessed value of $5,000 (with $142.50 of taxes owed). In 1941, the Stewarts sold the farm to the Deans, who owned it until 1950. The farm passed from the Deans to the Sterritts, who sold to Frank E. Low in 1969. The Lows sold off part of the property, reducing it to the current acreage of , during their ownership. Since the Low period, ownership of the property has changed hands repeatedly. Pamela Hobbs purchased the house in 1971 and proceeded to undertake repairs, including refurbishing the porch and reconstructing the beehive oven. Michele Saunders-Laine, purchased the property in 2004. The current owners, Evren Ay and Asli Ay purchased the property in September 2010.  Architectural Analysis  The Rushmore farmhouse is a -story vernacular stone house built in two separate sections. Stone is a traditional building material in the upper Hudson Valley due to the large limestone ridge that runs the entire length of west side of the Hudson River from Albany south to Kingston and then inland to Port Jervis. Although stone houses are often considered a building type specific to Dutch settlement groups, Huguenot, German, and English settlers built them as well, and members of these groups borrowed freely from each other. Most examples of the type are relatively similar in appearance, characterized by a long, low form, probably reflecting the structural capabilities of the rubble stone walls, and a steep gable roof, and most grew by accretion, adding new rooms in a linear pattern. Nevertheless, within the general type, construction details and spatial divisions varied and often reflected ethnic or geographic differences. Other distinctions, such as overall size, number of rooms, and degree of ornamentation might reflect differences of class and status; however, all stone-houses symbolized that their owners had achieved a certain degree of wealth or position, as those without either were generally housed in wooden structures. Examination of the Rushmore house corroborates a late 18th-century construction date for the western, original half of the building. This section has a three-bay fa√ßade with center entrance and an interior end chimney on the west wall. A window south of the chimney on the west wall is a later addition. Although there is little intact original fabric in this section, several conclusions can be drawn from extant features. The hewn ceiling beams, which run north-south, are relatively small in size, in keeping with late 18th century and early 19th century construction methods. Although the beams are now exposed, the ceiling was probably originally plastered. A large east-west summer beam, added in the 1970s, suggests the approximate location of an original partition in the west room that would have both supported the light beams and divided the room into a two-thirds/one-third configuration, with the larger space, inside the door, serving as the kitchen. The smaller room towards the back of the building was the location of an enclosed stair to the second floor. The space to the east, now a kitchen, laundry and bath, would probably also have been divided into two spaces, and a second chimney may have been located on the east wall of the original house. The latter chimney would have been removed when the east section was added. Hewn rafters with scribe marks in the attic also support a late 18th-century construction date for the west side. The original three-bay facade, as well as the compact arrangement of small rooms, is typical of English building practices and may also reflect the family' s Long Island origins. The eastern section of the building, which doubled the size of the farmhouse, had probably been added by 1813, when Jeremiah Rushmore placed the advertisement describing two houses on his property. The existence of the addition is confirmed by Jeremiah 's will and codicil from 1826 and 1828, respectively, which specified that his mother and sister were to retain use of the parlor and upper bedrooms in the \\"new\\" house. The hall and best room plan survives on the first floor, where other original fabric includes the windows and mantel. The tall ceiling, originally intended to be plastered, is also indicative of the early 19th century period. A built- in hutch was added next to the chimney in a later period. The new kitchen was located in the basement, enhancing the compact design of the house. This variation, while not unique, contrasts with a number of period stone residences, which often featured kitchen additions on rear or end walls. In the half story of the east addition, the original two bedrooms have been combined into one, and ceilings have been removed to expose the original rafters. Despite changes, the interior of the farmhouse retains sufficient integrity to provide information about its original construction and evolution over time. Changes to the exterior of the house include the addition of a full-width porch, frieze, and corniche with returns. Although the date of these alterations is not documented, the use of the Greek Revival style and the fact that a number of repair projects were undertaken by Deborah Rushmore between 1837 and 1843 suggests that these changes may have occurred in that period. Dormer windows on the south elevation are also not original; however, their date of construction is not known. One dependency, a stone smokehouse, survives to represent the agricultural history of the property. Ruins of a barn and silo have not yet been studied but promise to enhance our understanding of the farm. Although the property retains ninety-five acres of original Rushmore land, much of it is too wet for farming, and there are no longer any orchards associated with it. Nevertheless, the property retains an open pastoral quality and a secluded setting that help to recall its long history as a working farm.

The village is east of Quin and north of Shannon. Demographics The population of Kilkishen at the 2006 Census was 443, a rise from 324 at the 2002 Census.Table 12 (contd.) Alphabetical list of Towns with their population, 2002 and 2006 , p. 141 (p. 12 in pdf) According to a report by Samuel Lewis in 1837, the village had a population of 519. Facilities Kilkishen is in the civil parish of Clonlea and in the Catholic parish of O'Callaghans Mills. The first church at Kilkishen was probably built very early in the 19th century. It is mentioned in an 1811 report of a dispute that led to violence over who should sit nearest to the altar. Major renovation or reconstruction of the church of St Senan's was completed in 1865. The church was later abandoned, but in 2014 the building was restored and converted into Kilkishen Cultural Centre. Kilkishen National School is in the village and, according to their website, has an enrollment of 108 students. The village is the home of the Clare Shout Festival, which was first held in 2006 and is now held annually in September. The history of the Clare Shout is uncertain, but is believed to date back to pre-Celtic times in Ireland. There is a theory that the Clare Shout may have been a form of autumnal worship in pagan times. Sport Kilkishen GAA was a hurling team that is now defunct. The team won the Clare Senior Hurling Championship in 1923 and 1932 and were finalists in 1938. The village has a junior level camogie club.

A soft set is a parameterised family of sets - intuitively, this is \\"soft\\" because the boundary of the set depends on the parameters. Formally, a soft set, over a universal set X and set of parameters E is a pair (f, A) where A is a subset of E, and f is a function from A to the power set of X. For each e in A, the set f(e) is called the value set of e in (f, A). One of the most important steps for the new theory of soft sets was to define mappings on soft sets, which was achieved in 2009 by the mathematicians Athar Kharal and Bashir Ahmad, with the results published in 2011. Soft sets have also been applied to the problem of medical diagnosis for use in medical expert systems. Fuzzy soft sets have also been introduced.

There are six parts, screened from Sunday 2 October 1977; the series has not been rescreened as TV One omitted to obtain repeat rights. The series is about Sir George Grey as Governor of New Zealand from 1845‚Äì53 and 1861‚Äì68. In the nineteenth century he was both Governor and (later) Prime Minister of New Zealand, and Governor of South Australia and Governor of the Cape Colony. Neville describes him as ‚Äúa Victorian gentleman, a drug addict (he used laudanum) and a lecher‚Äù. The cost (with over-runs) was $1 million, and Prime Minister Rob Muldoon instigated an investigation by the parliamentary public expenditure committee into budgeting and the control of expenditure in television. The series also aroused controversy because of the emphasis on Grey's private life, and the dialogue in the MƒÅori language, often without subtitles. Keith Aberdein wrote the script, from an idea by Michael A. Noonan, and carried out his own historical research and interviews. The series was produced by Tony Isaac. It won the 1978 Feltex Award for best drama, and Episode 4 won the award for best script.

Early history It was founded by Nyawon Kunga Pel (1285 - 1379) in 1366, under the sponsorship of Prince Phakpa Pelzangpo (1318-1370 CE), Gyantse's first prince. Nyawon Kunga Pel gave teachings to about 600 disciples in epistemology and the Kalachakra Tantra. He invited Drigung LotsƒÅwa Ma·πáika≈õrƒ´j√±ƒÅna (1289 - 1363) to Tsechen for teachings. Tsechen was the seat of the kings of Gyantse until the town expanded in the 15th century. Tsongkapa's principal teacher, Remdawa Zhonu Lodro Zhonu (1349‚Äì1412), resided here. Jamyang Konchok Zangpo (1398 - 1475), the 14th Throne Holder of Jokhang Monastery, held the monastic seat at Tsechen for a time; Namkha Chokyong (1436 - 1507) the 14th Throne Holder of Jokhang Monastery, held the monastic seat at Tsechen for an extended period. It was the seat of the incarnation of Buton Rinchendrub, known as Kungra Lodro.Dorje (2009), p. 313. 20th Century to present On 28 June, Brigadier-General Macdonald, who had just arrived that day, concluded that Tsechen, which guarded the rear of the Gyantse Dzong, would have to be cleared before the assault of Gyantse Dzong could begin. Shortly before sunset, that same day, the nearby \\"seemingly impregnable\\" Tsechen Monastery and Dzong was stormed, after a heavy bombardment by the British ten-pound cannon.Allen (2004), p. 207. :\\"Tsechen was the site of one of the major battles of the Younghusband expedition en route for Lhasa. \\"A force of 1200 Tibetans held a fortified monastery at Tsechen which guarded the Shigatse road ... The capture of the monastery opened the road to Lhasa and effectively meant that all routes in and out of Gyantse were controlled by the British Tibet expedition.\\" As the monastery had resisted the British it was considered \\"fair game\\" and heavily looted. Then, on 5 July, coinciding with the beginning of the assault on Gyantse Dzong, the monastery was set on fire causing a 'tremendous blaze' which burned throughout the night, to prevent it being reoccupied by the Tibetans.Allen (2004), p 208-209, 215. :N.

Thomas Erskine married Elizabeth Scrymgeour.Register of the Great Seal (Edinburgh, 1883), nos. 308, 1132, 1149, 1180. Their son, Thomas, (later styled younger of Haltoun), was married to Agnes Ogilvy by 1541.Register of the Great Seal (Edinburh, 1883), nos. 2432-3. He had license to travel abroad in April 1542, with his cousin John Erskine of Dun, and John Lamby of Duncany.HMC 5th Report: Erskine (London, 1876), p. 639. Career He was first appointed secretary by Margaret Tudor and James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Arran in 1524.'Pittodrie Papers', Spalding Club Miscellany, vol. 2 (Aberdeen, 1842), p. 178. As a reward for his services at home and abroad, in August 1531 Thomas was given the important task of keeping, repairing, and garrisoning Tantallon Castle, which James V of Scotland had obtained from the exiled Earl of Angus.Register of the Great Seal of Scotland, 1513-46 (Edinburgh, 1883), p. 230 no. 1049. He was at Tantallon in July 1533.James Balfour Paul, Accounts of the Treasurer: 1531-1538, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1905), p. 137. As a further reward for his services he was granted the lands and lordship of Brechin and Navar on 4 February 1534. He had been the chamberlain of these lands since 1527. The charter described him as Sir Thomas Erskine of Kirkbuddo. Some of the yearly fees due to the crown for these lands were used for the wages of the garrison of Stirling Castle.The Miscellany of the Spalding Club (Aberdeen, 1842), pp. 188-9. It has been suggested that Erskine was a founder of the College of Justice, and he may have been educated at Pavia.Hannay, Robert Kerr, The College of Justice (Edinburgh, 1933), 63. Later he came under the king‚Äôs suspicion for communicating with the banished Douglas family.'Pittrodrie Papers' (1842), p. 193. Erskine witnessed king James's will on the Salamander at Leith on 12 June 1540 before his voyage to Orkney and the Western Isles.HMC 60 16th Report Mar & Kellie Manuscripts (London, 1904), p. 15. In 1548, Erskine travelled to mainland Europe to rescue one of his sons from captivity.'Pittodrie Papers', Miscellany of the Spalding Club (Aberdeen, 1842), 205. Royal wedding planner James V was destined for a French marriage by the Treaty of Rouen of 1517, which aimed to secure the Auld Alliance. Erskine travelled to France, Rome, and England regarding James‚Äôs marriage, notionally to Madeleine of Valois daughter of Francis I of FranceSpalding Club, (1842), 180-181, 186-7. (Latin). Erskine was sent to France as a diplomat to contract this marriage in April 1530. He was joined in this commission with John Stewart, Duke of Albany.Spalding Club Miscellany, vol. 2 (1842), 180-181 (Latin). However, at this time James V's advisors and the Duke of Albany hoped to gain political advantage by contracting the King's marriage to Catherine de' Medici the young Duchess of Urbino. On his way to Rome to meet Albany in December 1531 to further the Urbino marriage with Pope Clement VI,Spalding Miscellany, vol. 2 (1842), 190-192 (text of Erskine's instructions n.d.) Erskine was shipwrecked on the French coast. When Erskine arrived in Rome in the spring of 1531 he dined with the Spanish ambassador Mai, who may have been a fellow student at Pavia. Erskine's instructions may have included asking Albany to press Clement VI to allow James V to tax the church in Scotland. The historian Robert Kerr Hannay argued that the resultant 'tax of the three teinds' was part of the process of the formation of the College of Justice.Hannay, Robert Kerr, 'On the Foundation of the College of Justice',' in The Scottish Historical Review, vol. 15, no.57 (Oct. 1917), p. 35 citing CSP Spain & L&P;, vol. 5, p.125. The marriage plan changed, and in February 1533, two French ambassadors, William du Bellay, sieur de Langes and Etienne de Laigue, sieur de Beauvais, who had just been in Scotland, told the Venetian ambassador in London that James was thinking of marrying Christina of Denmark.Calendar of State Papers Venice, vol. 4 (London, 1871), no. 861. Two years later, Erskine was in France with David Beaton still trying to secure the King's marriage to Princess Madeleine. He had letters of recommendation from James V to Eleanor of France, the Queen of Navarre, Madame Aubigny and Robert Stuart, sieur d'Aubigny, the Chancellor Antoine Duprat Cardinal of Sens, the Admiral Philippe de Chabot, the Grand Master Anne de Montmorency, and the French Secretary Jean le Breton, sieur de Villandry. Erskine and Beaton were instructed to arrange for Madeleine to come to Scotland next summer, when she was fourteen, or in July 1535.Hay, Denys, ed., The Letters of James V (HMSO, 1954), pp. 172, 182, 189, 254-259. Initially, Francis I organised a substitute bride: Erskine was at Cremieu on 6 March 1536 when the contract was made for James V to marry Mary of Bourbon, daughter of the Duke of Vend√¥me.Cameron, Jamie, James V (Tuckwell: East Linton, 1998), p. 131.

Zuhdi Jasser, and Mohamed Zuhdi Jasser (; born 17 November 1967) is an American medical doctor specializing in internal medicine and nuclear cardiology in Phoenix, Arizona. Jasser is a former lieutenant commander in the United States Navy, where he served as staff internist in the Office of the Attending Physician of the United States Congress. In 2003, with a group of American Muslims, Jasser founded the American Islamic Forum for Democracy (AIFD) based in Phoenix, Arizona, and in 2004 he was one of the founders of the Center for Islamic Pluralism. He is also a contributor to national and international media, where he has advocated separation of mosque and state and spoken against the ideology of \\"political Islam\\" or Islamism. He has been a frequent guest on Fox News Channel, Newsmax TV, CNN, CBS, MSNBC, and TheBlaze. He has also contributed articles to nationally read newspapers such as the Arizona Republic, The Dallas Morning News, The New York Post, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Times. In March 2012, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) appointed Jasser to serve a two-year term on the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom. Biography Born on November 17, 1967 in Dayton, Ohio, Jasser is the son of Syrians who immigrated to the United States in the 1960s, owing to repression in their homeland. His grandfather, Zuhdi Jasser, who owned a vegetable oil company in Syria was a devout Muslim with an admiration of the West. His father, Mohamed Kais Jasser, is a cardiologist who studied medicine at the London University and Syria in the early 1960s, he was an active critic through his newspaper columns, which led to his migration with his pharmacist wife in 1963 from Beirut, Lebanon to the United States. Jasser was raised in Appleton, Wisconsin, until the age of 6. The family then moved to Neenah, Wisconsin, where he was raised in the Sunni branch of Islam. He attended the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee, earning his bachelor of science in 1988; then he attended the Medical College of Wisconsin on a U.S. Navy scholarship, receiving his M.D. in 1992. He served in the Navy for 11 years, receiving the Meritorious Service Medal and attaining the rank of lieutenant commander by the time of his honorable discharge in 1999. His tours of duty included staff internist for the U.S. Congress, medical department head aboard the USS El Paso, and chief resident at Bethesda Naval Hospital. He moved to Arizona after his discharge from the Navy, taking over part of his father's medical practice. Jasser frequently writes and talks about the issue of political Islam. James Woolsey former head of the CIA and Seth Liebsohn, author and radio show host describe him as \\"the kind of man our government should listen to.\\" Jasser utilizes his commentating, speaking engagements, and media appearances \\"to press Muslim leaders to aggressively oppose a 'culture of separatism.'\\" On March 10, 2011, Jasser appeared as a witness at the first in a series of hearings conducted by the United States House Committee on Homeland Security on \\"The Extent of Radicalization in the American Muslim Community and the Community's Response.\\" Jasser's testimony focused on how the polarization of American views of the Muslim community are an obstacle to reform within the faith. During his testimony he said that American Muslim organizations had been \\"circling the wagons\\" and have too frequently cautioned Muslims against speaking to law enforcement without a lawyer present. He also said that political Islam was based on the idea that the government should be run under Islamic law, which he said violated the American concept of separation of church and state. On June 24, 2011, Jasser appeared before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution to testify in favor of H.R. 963, the \\"See Something, Say Something\\" Act. Jasser's medical practice is in Phoenix, Arizona, and he resides in Scottsdale, Arizona, with his wife and three children, who are being raised as Muslims. Views on Islam Jasser describes himself as a devout Muslim who believes that \\"America in fact provides the best atmosphere for Muslims to practice our faith.\\" He does not claim to be a formal expert in Koranic Arabic, or in sharia (Islamic jurisprudence), but he \\"see[s] Islam (consistent with 'Ijtihad,' the tradition of critical interpretation of Islamic scripture) as applicable in the modern world and subject to logic and reason.\\" Jasser began criticizing American Muslim organizations including the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the Islamic Society of North America, the North American Imams Federation, the Assembly of Muslim Jurists of America, Muslim Students' Association, the Muslim Public Affairs Council, the Muslim American Society, the Islamic Circle of North America, and the Center for the Study of Islam and Democracy, because he sees them as Islamist, meaning they support a mixing of Islam and politics. He has been especially critical of CAIR, a Muslim American civil rights group that, according to Jasser, is focused on \\"victimology\\" and does not adequately condemn the goals of the terrorist groups. A CAIR official has responded, \\"[W]ith these people, nothing we would do would satisfy them\\" and going so far as to claim that Zuhdi is \\"a mere sock puppet for Islam haters.\\" Jasser has also engaged in interfaith activities, serving on the board of the Arizona Interfaith Movement; helping to found an Arizona-based organization called The Children of Abraham, a Jewish-Muslim dialogue group in 2000, and a chapter of Seeds of Peace in 2003. Jasser has said that he and his family have helped build a number of small mosques in different cities using locally raised funds, and at times encountering, but always overcoming local opposition. In 2010 Jasser strongly opposed the building of the Park51 project, a 13-story Islamic community center and mosque two blocks from the World Trade Center site, which is also known as Ground Zero. He said he was concerned that the funding of the $100 million project might be coming from foreign Islamist sources, and also said: \\"Ground Zero is purely about being American. It can never be about being Muslim.\\" Jasser believes acts of Islamic terrorism are rooted in the ideology of political Islam or Islamism. He has expressed the opinion that the 2009 Christmas Day attempted airplane bombing, the 2009 Fort Hood shooting, and the 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt have not prodded the United States into the appropriate action, but rather have resulted in politically correct denial by U.S. government authorities, and inaction by most American Muslims. He believes that even the Bush administration took inadequate measures against Islamism in America. He says the U.S. needs to provide alternatives for Muslim youth and promote reformist groups. In his television appearances, Jasser has claimed that 3 to 5 percent of U.S. Muslims are militant and 30 to 40 percent do not believe in separation of mosque and state. He also states that he believes many Western Muslim imams are too timid in their response to Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant seemingly both criticizing but also sympathizing with its goal of a caliphate stating \\"Clearly, the majority of the mosques in the United States are led by imams who are Islamists ‚Äî who believe that in Muslim-majority countries that the state should be identified as an Islamic state.\\"Toledo Blade: \\"Clerics challenge ISIS' view of Islam - Local imams denounce terrorism\\" by Tom Troy November 22, 2015 Views on Israel Jasser is an outspoken supporter of Israel and believes that Muslim organizations and leaders need to be held to a litmus test to see whether they recognize Israel as a state. American Islamic Forum for Democracy Jasser and a group of American Muslims founded the nonprofit American Islamic Forum for Democracy (AIFD) in 2003 with the goal of demonstrating the compatibility of Islam with democracy and American values. Jasser is the group's president and chief spokesman. The AIFD supports separation of religion and state, religious pluralism, equality of the sexes, the unconditional recognition of Israel, and the creation of an independent Palestine \\"on the current 'occupied territories.'\\" The organization rejects terrorism and any justification for it. Documentaries Jasser has contributed to four documentaries. He appeared in the PBS film Islam v Islamists: Voices from the Muslim Center, which PBS suppressed after pressure from Muslim organizations. He was the main narrator in the Clarion Fund film, The Third Jihad, which opens with Jasser stating, \\"This is not a film about Islam. It is about the threat of radical Islam. Only a small percentage of the world's 1.3 billion Muslims are radical. This film is about them.\\" Third Jihad's promotional materials state that \\"radical Islamists driven by a religiously motivated rejection of western values cultures and religion are engaging in a multifaceted strategy to overcome the western world.\\" The film stirred controversy, with the New Republic stating the producer of the film has ties to the Israeli settlement movement. Although Jasser has said he does not agree with everything in the film, he supports the overall message. Jasser also appeared in the 2010 Newt Gingrich film, America At Risk: The War With No Name, a production of Citizens United. The film's promotional materials state that \\"we are long overdue for a serious global strategy in fighting terrorism and the ideology behind it. We must have the courage to tell the truth and to act on that truth.\\" It has been described as \\"anti-Obama\\" by The Nation. Jasser also appeared in the Fox News documentary Fox Reporting: A Question of Honor, which examines the killing of Noor Al-Maleki in Peoria, Arizona, by her father, Falah Al-Maleki, and his subsequent trial. Reception According to the Washington Post, \\"In some ways, Zuhdi Jasser doesn't match the profile of the typical Muslim American. He's an active Republican who has supported the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, is an advocate for Israel and says his faith harbors 'an insidious supremacism.'\\" According to the progressive magazine Mother Jones, \\"Jasser has lately become the right's go-to guy when it comes to providing cover for policies or positions that many Muslim Americans contend are discriminatory. When controversy over the so-called Ground Zero mosque erupted, Jasser, a frequent guest on Fox News, accused the builders of trying to 'diminish what happened' on September 11, 2001. He has supported statewide bans on Shariah law in American courts and has helped bolster conservative warnings that American Muslims seek to replace the Constitution with a harsh interpretation of Islamic law.

These organizations in turn protested his March 2012 appointment to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom.

Jasser referred to Geller's allegations as \\"absolutely false\\", and responded to Geller's claims in an article which he wrote for American Thinker.

Retrieved 31-07-2010 Plot The film is set in Liverpool, where tugboat captain Joe Higgins (Edmund Gwenn), believing he has won a fortune on the football pools, resigns from his job and throws a party in a local public house where family and friends - some of whom have an eye on a share of the winnings - gather to celebrate his good luck. Higgins pays court to the widow Clegg (Maire O'Neill) who he has been wooing, while his daughter Betty (Betty Driver) is targeted by a chancer who sniffs money. The party grinds to a halt with the arrival of the hapless Pat (Jimmy O'Dea), Higgins' Irish first mate on the tugboat, who is forced to admit that he forgot to post the winning pools coupon. There now seems no reason for celebration, but Higgins is mollified when his former employer offers him the captaincy of the best tugboat on the River Mersey, a position to which he had long aspired. The action of the film is interspersed with several musical numbers performed by Driver and one by O'Dea. While O'Dea's song is clearly provided for comic effect, those sung by Driver are presented straight.

It is currently based at 104B E 126th Street in Manhattan. Profile The group is a nonprofit organization whose goal is to end homelessness. It believes that people who are homeless must become an organized, effective voice for systemic change. PTH attempts to develop leadership among homeless people to impact policies and systems that affect their lives. They also endeavor to create space for them, and their agenda, within the broader social justice movement. They are strong proponents of diverting funds from the New York City Department of Homeless Services out of the shelter system and into community land trusts. To this end, the organization founded a coalition called The New York City Community Land Initiative with The New Economy Project and other groups.Brendan O'Oonnor. \\"The Ungentrifiers: Hiding affordable apartments from a ravenous market.\\" The Awl.

Their campaigns have included fighting for affordable housing. Their actions have included occupying buildings and vacant lots.

It had an estimated magnitude of 7.0‚Äì7.5 and triggered a tsunami that was recorded in Libya and Alexandria. The strongest shaking was felt in Nicosia, Limassol and Paphos. Many people died, although there are no estimates for the total number of casualties. Tectonic setting The estimated location of the earthquake is on the southwestern coast of Cyprus and is thought to be associated with the Cyprus arc. The Cyprus arc is part of the plate boundary zone that accommodates the motion of the African Plate relative to the Anatolian Plate. The relative motion of the Anatolian Plate is almost entirely westwards relative to the African Plate. In the eastern part of the arc, earthquakes are entirely strike-slip in character. To the west they show a combination of thrust faulting and strike-slip. A major NE-SW trending strike-slip structure has been identified just west of Cyprus, that is responsible for larger earthquakes in this area. Damage Much damage was caused at Limassol and Nicosia and other parts of the island, but the greatest damage was done at Paphos, where there was great loss of life. Paphos Castle, a Byzantine fort, was destroyed and had to be rebuilt by the Lusignans. A modern excavation at Paphos Castle found the remains of a man who apparently climbed into the castle's main drain to escape the earthquake but was trapped there by falling masonry. The sea retreated from the harbour but returned and flooded the town. A church is said to have fallen, burying the bishop and his congregation. Monks of the Franciscan order abandoned their church in Paphos after the earthquake. The castle of Saranta Kolones, built only 30 years earlier overlooking the harbour, was destroyed by the earthquake. It was never rebuilt, as it was no longer needed to protect the port, which had dried up. The earthquake permanently changed Paphos, rendering the harbour unusable, and moving the shoreline seawards; it no longer had a protected anchorage. Characteristics The estimated magnitude for this event is 7.0‚Äì7.5 with a maximum estimated felt intensity of IX (Violent).

Pupilla loessica is a significant glacial index species for the Pleistocene in Central and Eastern Europe and also in parts of NorthWestern Europe. It lives as extant species in Central Asia.  Distribution  Pupilla loessica was first described by Czech biologist Vojen Lo≈æek in 1954 from late Pleistocene loess from P≈ôedmost√≠ u P≈ôerova (Moravia, Czech Republic). For the Pleistocene in Central and Eastern Europe and also in parts of NorthWestern Europe, Pupilla loessica constitutes a significant glacial index species. Individual specimens had been found since the early Pleistocene. It was widespread above all in the middle Pleistocene and late Pleistocene. Fossil distribution of Pupilla loessica include: * central Europe in Pleistocene. Found in loess sediments. At an early date (1986), Lo≈æek supported the view that Pupilla loessica was alive at the present time in Central Asia.

The approximately 5 strongly curved whorls gradually increase in height and are finely and irregularly ribbed. The short elliptical aperture has no denticles, no palatal callus and is only slightly broadened. The crest is at most indicated by a weak band. The shells are usually a strong brown colour when fresh. The fine ribs evidence very low, fragile rims which are not always visible in recent shells. On weathered shells the fine ribs are still visible although less pronounced, as on the shells of the Pleistocene Pupilla loessica. The width of the recent shells is 1.6-1.8 mm. The height of the shells of the recent shell is 2.5-3.3 mm. The species differs from Pupilla muscorum by its smaller size, the strongly rounded and ribbed whorls and the lack of denticles and crest.  Ecology  Pupilla loessica occur from woodland to dry steppe. The altitude ranges from 560 m a.s.l. to high altitude habitats around 3000 m a.s.l. This species prefer continental types of habitat with average annual temperatures markedly below 0 ¬∞C. The climate ranges from continental to sub-boreal climate. Although it is a frequent loess mollusc, it apparently lived in various glacial habitats. Pupilla loessica is found in various different habitats in the Saylyugem Mountains. These habitats range from stony steppe via open woodland with Larix sibirica, shrubland, mesophilic meadows to humid high altitude meadows with Carex sp. and Dryas oxyodonta (alpine tundra). For example in Saylyugem Mountains Pupilla loessica lives in 2200‚Äì2650 m a.s.l. The closest known meteorological station is the Kosh Agach Station: the average annual temperature recorded amounts to ‚Äì6.7 ¬∞C (January ‚Äì32 ¬∞C, July 13 ¬∞C) and the annual rainfall amounts to about 110‚Äì150 mm on average. This species often accompanies the so-called Pupilla fauna and Columella fauna (according to Lo≈æek 1964).Lo≈æek V. (1964). Quart√§rmollusken der Tschechoslowakei. ‚Äì Rozpravy √öst≈ôedn√≠ho √∫stavu geologick√©ho, Praha, 31: 374 pp. In addition to Pupilla spp., species which like humidity, such as Columella columella or Vertigo genesii, are also often found together with Pupilla loessica. The corresponding accompanying fauna is also adapted to the cold habitats, including e.g. Columella columella, Vertigo genesii, Vallonia tenuilabris, etc. Such malacofauna in recent habitats (especially on the humid alpine meadows) correspond to those of the Pleistocene glacial habitats of the Central European region.

The character originally appeared in the first series of the Hollyoaks spin-off, Hollyoaks Later. In 2010, Hollyoaks series producer Paul Marquess asked Hassan to join Hollyoaks as part of the soap's ongoing rejuvenation, to which she agreed and the character began appearing in the main show from 11 August 2010. Hassan left Hollyoaks in 2012 when her character was killed off during a \\"dramatic cliffhanger\\" episode. To surprise the audience, the actress's exit was not announced beforehand. Hassan's final scenes were broadcast on 21 August 2012, giving viewers the \\"ending they were looking for\\". The character's main storyline during her time on the serial featured her feud with serial killer Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle) in which she was initially targeted by the villain. Lynsey becomes \\"determined to find the evidence\\" she needs to expose Silas, entering into a game of cat- and-mouse with the murderer who begins trying to send her mad so no one will listen to her claims. During the conclusion of the plot, Silas sets Lynsey a \\"sick game\\" to guess his next victim or that victim will die. Silas attempts to kill Lynsey again but mistakenly kills his daughter, Heidi Costello (Kim Tiddy) leading to his arrest. The character also had brief relationships with Malachy Fisher (Glen Wallace), Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan) and Riley Costello (Rob Norbury). Lynsey's exit plot saw the character murdered in a whodunit storyline, with the character clashing with several characters in the run up to her exit to give them motive to kill her. Lynsey's murderer was revealed to be Dr. Paul Browning (Joseph Thompson), who had killed her to prevent her revealing that Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe) had stabbed herself. The character has been described by Hassan who said she is the \\"typical girl next door\\" who sees the best in people. During Lynsey's feud with Silas the character was played to show a stronger and more determined side. Hollyoaks official website has also described the character, saying she has a \\"delicate exterior\\" but the \\"heart and courage of a lion\\". On 9 April 2013, Hassan announced that she would return to Hollyoaks as a ghost or in a vision during a storyline involving the wedding of Doctor Browning and Mercedes McQueen which also happens to be on the first anniversary of her death. Hassan has been nominated for various awards for her portrayal of Lynsey. Lynsey was voted Hero of the Year by fans for E4 special Hollyoaks: Best Bits of 2011 and has been both praised and criticised by the British press for the suspense built up during the Silas plot, for putting herself in danger during her feud with Silas and for the shock of her exit. Following her exit Hassan received a large number of messages on social networking site Twitter and was also praised by her Hollyoaks colleagues. Character creation and casting Lynsey was introduced as the best friend of established character, Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh), during the first series of Hollyoaks Later in 2008. Karen Hassan auditioned for the role of Lynsey, along with twenty other Irish actresses. Hassan said that she felt nervous prior to the audition, as she was a big fan of Hollyoaks. The actress won the role and was contracted for five episodes. Hassan told Dawn Collinson from the Liverpool Echo that once she had completed the five episodes, she returned home to Belfast where she appeared in various television and theatre productions. In June 2010, Kris Green from Digital Spy reported that Hassan would join Hollyoaks in August, as part of an ongoing rejuvenation of the serial. Series producer Paul Marquess believed that Lynsey and the other new characters he was introducing would bring \\"more fun, drama and sexiness to the show\\". Hassan had not expected to be asked to join Hollyoaks and said it was an exciting, but scary prospect. The actress relocated to Liverpool for filming. Her character's introduction to Hollyoaks was low-key, which made Hassan believe that she would just be kept in the background. She felt like Lynsey was \\"kind of plodding along\\" and asked the producer if he was happy with her work. He then revealed that he had been thinking along the same lines and told her that she would be a major part in an upcoming storyline featuring Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle). Character development =Characterisation= During an interview with a reporter from the show's official website, Hassan explained that Lynsey had been best friends with Cheryl for a long time. When Lynsey joined Cheryl in the village, she quickly found herself a job at the local hospital and fell in love. Hassan described Lynsey as being \\"a very loyal person\\", who wanted to see the best in people and would do anything for her family and friends. Hassan tried to make her character's personality similar to her own, so she would be believable to the viewers. Hassan felt that on occasion Lynsey needed to stand up for herself, agreeing with the reporter who called her \\"a bit of a push-over.\\" She later said that Lynsey should speak her true opinions more and stop being \\"a soft touch\\". A new side to the character started to emerge when she began to grow a backbone and Hassan opined that Lynsey could \\"hold her own\\". The actress commented to an OK! journalist that Lynsey was the typical girl next door, who could stand \\"on her own two feet\\" and speak what was on her mind. Hassan also thought that she had a very long fuse, but if it reached the end then you would see the spark in her. During the storyline with Silas, viewers were able to see a stronger and more determined side to the character. A writer for E4's official Hollyoaks website said viewers should not let the character's \\"delicate exterior\\" fool them, as beneath it she had \\"the heart and courage of a lion\\". They explained that Lynsey was required to prove she had a backbone during several crisis situations, in which she demonstrated her \\"superhero antics\\". But that her real test of character came after she was attacked by Silas. They added that the attack marked the beginning of a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse that led to Lynsey losing her friends, job, home and nearly her sanity. Various media sources described Lynsey as flirty, determined, brave, plucky, gorgeous and a beauty. After her exit, Hassan said she would like Lynsey to be remembered as a \\"serial killer hunter extraordinaire\\", the girl next door with a big heart, Cheryl's best friend and \\"the girl who could never really find the man of her dreams!\\" =Relationship with Gilly Roach= In February 2011, Lynsey became attracted to widower Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan) and they began a short relationship. After Gilly became a personal trainer at Look Sharpe, a local day spa, he invited Lynsey to come along for a free session. Quinlan told Inside Soap journalist, Steven Murphy, that Lynsey is \\"looking pretty good when she turns up\\" and she would eventually end up \\"hopping into the tub and dragging Gilly in there fully clothed!\\" Hassan said that she found the scene in which Lynsey pulled Gilly into the hot tub \\"embarrassing\\", despite knowing Quinlan well. She added that the scenes were not romantic to film due to the water being cold. Lynsey and Gilly later arranged a date together, which prompted Gilly to remove his wedding ring. Quinlan thought that Gilly's decision was a \\"bit harsh\\" because it was too soon for him to consider moving on from his wife, Steph (Carley Stenson). The actor stated that viewers would have to wait to see what would happen between Lynsey and Gilly, but believed that there was no comparison when it came to her and Steph. =Feud with Silas Blissett= In February 2011, Susan Hill from the Daily Star reported that Lynsey would become the next target of serial killer Silas Blissett. Hassan revealed that executive producer Paul Marquess brought her into his office to tell her that she would be involved in a \\"really big storyline\\", which he outlined to her, leaving her really excited. The storyline began when Lynsey angered Silas, who then attacked her. Silas was scared off after Lynsey's screams alerted his grandson Riley Costello (Rob Norbury) to the situation. Hassan thought Lynsey's \\"steeliness\\" helped her break free from Silas. Lynsey realised Silas was the one who attacked her, after she heard his voice which \\"triggers a flashback\\" to the moment of the attack. Hassan added that when nobody believed Lynsey, it \\"makes her want to bring Silas down even more. She's determined to find the evidence she needs to expose him for what he is\\". Waugh, who plays Lynsey's best friend Cheryl, explained that everyone believes that Lynsey is crazy and has made up the allegations. Lynsey then turns to Cheryl for help and although she hates seeing her best friend in such a state, Cheryl believed Lynsey was just being paranoid. When Silas suffers a heart attack, Lynsey is faced with a dilemma when he is placed under her care. Hassan revealed that her character is not \\"thinking straight\\" and even though it is her job to save lives, Lynsey can not decide if she should come to the aid of the person who attempted to kill her. Lynsey is not sure if Silas is genuinely ill. In March 2011, Hassan revealed that Silas would want revenge on Lynsey after her telling people that he is behind recent murders. Hassan told a reporter from All About Soap that Lynsey innocently buys diet pills for Cheryl off the internet but Silas sees this as an opportunity to seek revenge and switches them with his heart medication, leading to Cheryl collapsing in Chez Chez. Cheryl is found by Lynsey, who is terrified for Cheryl and feels guilty. Lynsey is told that Cheryl has sedatives in her system although she is \\"completely flummoxed\\" as to how this happened as she does not consider that Silas would have wanted to hurt Cheryl. Hassan explained that Silas plans to \\"blacken\\" Lynsey's name with the scheme. Rawle revealed that Silas would work on \\"discrediting\\" Lynsey and would undermine her because she is aware of his secret. He explained that Silas would do this by breaking into her flat and moving things around in the middle of the night, adding that \\"it's like a war of attrition\\" with Silas planning to \\"wear her down and send her mad\\". Jeff Rawle (pictured) plays Lynsey's nemesis, Silas Blissett who she enters a game of cat-and-mouse with. Hassan explained that when Silas realises Lynsey is trying to bring him down again he \\"basically tells her to bring it on\\". She continued saying that Silas \\"gets off\\" on the idea that Lynsey is trying to prevent him from killing again as it makes his game more interesting. Texas Longford (Bianca Hendrickse-Spendlove) portrays her murdered sister, India (Beth Kingston), in a reconstruction of India's death. The actress explained that during the campaign Lynsey notices Silas is smiling and \\"his eyes are full of glee while Texas is clearly in turmoil\\" reconfirming her earlier suspicions that Silas killed India. Lynsey steals India's necklace from Texas and plants it on Silas before calling the police with an anonymous tip-off. Hassan revealed that Lynsey does this in the hope that Silas' lies will unravel, explaining that now Lynsey has \\"entered into this game of cat-and- mouse with Silas, she'll get deeper and deeper\\". Rawle explained Silas' plan to discredit Lynsey, saying his character plans to send Lynsey mad so that no one will listen to her. He \\"needs to keep her in check, but Silas delights in the idea that Lynsey thinks she's good enough to play him\\". Silas begins messing with items in Lynsey's home, which is part of his plan to alter her reality so that \\"when she insists one thing is happening, it appears not to be the case the next minute\\". Rawle explained that this is a subtle way of sending her mad. Lynsey decides that as Silas is out to silence her she will try to catch him out and turn the tables on Silas, although Rawle teased that Silas will retaliate. He opined that although Lynsey is clever, she is not clever enough to outwit Silas and is \\"screaming from the rooftops about what he's done, but no one's listening\\". Lynsey decides to temporarily leave the village. Hassan revealed Cheryl's brother, Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan), would become involved with the storyline and would begin to think that there is something odd about Silas, although Brendan does not think Silas is a murderer. The actress said that this leaves Lynsey to fight her own battles, teasing that the situation gets \\"even worse before it gets better\\". Lynsey discovers Texas has been speaking to a girl online. Hassan explained that when Texas is telling Lynsey about the girl she realise that the correspondent is actually Silas who is planning to hurt Texas. Lynsey arranges to meet the correspondent in the woods, planning to take journalist Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox) with her. However, Nancy does not plan to turn up following Silas' intervention. Hassan explained that Lynsey is unaware Nancy is not coming until \\"the penny drops that she's all alone in the woods with Silas, she's absolutely terrified\\". Lynsey goes missing, with the actress explaining that nobody knows where her character is. Hassan explained that Brendan finds a note which he believes is from Lynsey telling him to meet her in the woods and because he is already suspicious of Silas he come to rescue Lynsey. Brendan arrives at the woods and discovers the body of Rae Wilson (Alice Barlow) in his car before the police arrive and arrest Brendan. Lynsey soon after returns home. Lynsey is kicked out of the flat by Cheryl who does not believe her claims. It was revealed Jacqui McQueen (Claire Cooper) would become an unlikely ally for Lynsey. Cooper explained that Lynsey supported Jacqui through her rape trial and believed Jacqui was telling the truth. This means Jacqui can relate to Lynsey's situation with Silas as nobody believes Lynsey's claims, leading to them building \\"a great friendship\\". Hassan also commented on the friendship, saying she was surprised to hear the pair would become friends as naturally they would not be expected to be friends. She elaborated on this, saying the characters are at opposite \\"ends of the spectrum\\" but have both been through traumatic times and have had people not believe them. They have shown each other kindness so there is \\"a real tenderness in their friendship\\". Conclusion PJ Brennan (pictured) plays Doug who takes pity on Lynsey, showing her kindness and friendship during Silas' final game with Lynsey. It was revealed Silas would take his torment of Lynsey to a new level when he makes her play a \\"sick game\\". Silas tells Lynsey she has until Halloween to guess who his next victim will be and if she succeeds he will confess to the police but if Lynsey fails Silas will kill his intended victim. Spoiler pictures released indicated that Silas had lined Lynsey up as one of four potential victims. Another promotional image featuring Silas' targets, including Lynsey, dressed as Catwoman surrounding Silas dressed as the Grim reaper was released to coincide with the plot. Rawle explained that Silas makes Lynsey guess his next victim because he \\"really enjoys toying with Lynsey\\". Rawle revealed that Silas' victim could be anyone and that he is not longer acting rationally so is now very dangerous. Hassan explained that her character realises the threat is very real and she knows that her nemesis means business this time. Hassan explained that Lynsey does not cope with the challenge very well as she has already been pushed to breaking point over recent months and now she is trapped having to play Silas' psychotic game. Lynsey can not rest as she is thinking about the challenge, she is losing sleep and she has already lost her friends over her claims. It is a lot to have \\"resting on her shoulders - she knows that somebody's life is in her hands. Lynsey tries to stand up to Silas, but he outwits her at every turn\\". At her \\"lowest ebb\\", Lynsey confides in Doug Carter (PJ Brennan) whose girlfriend, Jenny (Daisy Turner), was killed by Silas. Hassan explained that Lynsey takes a big risk in confiding in Doug but Lynsey trusts him to keep it a secret. Lynsey feels like she should not be bringing Doug in to the dangerous situation but she realises that she needs someone to help her. Her portrayer went on to add that Doug believes Lynsey and shows her a lot of kindness and friendship. Lynsey is given clues by Silas to help her identify his next victim, although they leave Lynsey feeling like she has no way of figuring the potential victim's identity out as the clues seem to fit everyone. Hassan said that by the time Halloween arrives Lynsey feels \\"totally tired and exhausted\\". Silas reveals that Lynsey is the woman he intended to kill but she escapes. Silas kills a woman dressed as Catwoman, initially believing it to be Lynsey until he realises it is his daughter, Heidi Costello (Kim Tiddy). Lynsey soon after exposes Silas who is arrested. Hassan said that she had enjoyed seeing Lynsey show gumption during the storyline and hoped to see more of this side of her character. Reflecting on the storyline, Hassan said the storyline was amazing and added that she was enthusiastic to play the storyline. She said that previous to the storyline she had known she could show a feistier side and more depth to Lynsey which she was always aware existed. =Love triangle= Digital Spy revealed that after their suffering at the hands of Silas, Lynsey and Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe) would become friends after Lynsey becomes a source of support for Mercedes. Hassan said that the pair have a \\"kind of prickly friendship\\" and that they have a lot of things in common although they are very different people. She felt that it is almost like the characters should not be friends, but acknowledged that opposites attracted in this instance. Lynsey is attracted to Mercedes as she sees qualities in Mercedes that she wishes she had herself, such as Mercedes being straight-talking, ballsy and someone who \\"calls a spade a spade, and sometimes Lynsey wishes she had a bit of that gusto\\". When Mercedes begins working at the hospital as a cleaner and becomes involved with Doctor Browning (Joe Thompson), Metcalfe explained that the pair gp through everything which is a \\"real ride of emotions\\". Mercedes begins working as an escort which Lynsey discovers. Metcalfe explained that Lynsey comes to Mercedes' rescue when she is at her lowest point and she can see how broken Mercedes is so just hugs her friend. Lynsey begins a relationship with Mercedes' ex-fianc√© Riley. Metcalfe explained that if Mercedes discovered this she would feel \\"utterly betrayed by Lynsey\\". Metcalfe revealed that Lynsey and Mercedes learn that Silas will not stand trial. Mercedes feels can confide in Lynsey about the situation and has a few heart-to-hearts with Lynsey as she is the one person who fully understands the situation. Metcalfe said Lynsey proves how much she cares about Mercedes when she convinces her to see a psychiatrist. Hassan praised the plot saying it was great because of the chemistry between herself and Metcalfe. Metcalfe similarly praised the friendship saying she has loved it and has enjoyed seeing Mercedes and Lynsey form a good bond. Norbury said that he had spoken to executive producer Gareth Philips about the connection between Riley and Lynsey when they initially shared scenes. Hassan later teased that there could be complicated times for Lynsey when she begins to flirt with Riley. She said that there is a real sexual attraction between them but due to Lynsey's friendship with Riley's ex-fianc√©e Mercedes she would have to support Mercedes while having a secret relationship with Riley which could become complicated. Norbury said that although Riley feels Lynsey is a lovely girl and someone he can have a laugh with, Mitzeee (Rachel Shenton) is a better match for Riley. Hassan felt that her alter-ego is happy to keep things a secret between her and Riley although when Mitzeee discovers the relationship Lynsey is on the \\"receiving end of a lot of jealousy\\". Hassan explained that although Lynsey does not want to go head-to-head with Mercedes and Mitzeee, she will not step aside either. The actress said that Lynsey feels guilty because she is in a relationship with Riley behind Mercedes' back, but Lynsey feels that she deserves to be happy because she usually places everyone else's needs above her own. Mercedes discovers Lynsey's relationship with Riley, which Metcalfe explained comes as a shock to Mercedes who has developed a close friendship with Lynsey so does not react as expected. Hassan said that her character's love rivals, Mercedes and Mitzeee, \\"won't be looking after Lynsey's best interests, so she's going to have to fight for Riley's love. She's going to take care of number one - and if other people get hurt in the process, then so be it\\". She added that Lynsey values her friendship with Mercedes and would not want to lose it while Mitzeee is a different kind of threat. Hassan went on to say that the storyline will become \\"deeper and darker\\" and is not going to end happily, as even though Lynsey and Riley make a good couple Lynsey has never been lucky with men. =Departure and death= Karen Hassan (pictured) kept her exit from the serial a secret to maintain a \\"big shock factor\\" for the character's death. In 2012, Hassan decided to leave Hollyoaks. Her departure was a mutual decision made between herself and the producers. She intended to leave in August 2012, but to facilitate the storyline she had to leave early. Hassan recalled the scenario of filming her final scenes a mere three days prior to her character's on- screen exit. Hassan's departure was not announced and the producers managed to keep Lynsey's exit a secret until transmission of E4's first look edition of the 28 June 2012 episode. This was done to ensure that viewers were taken by surprise. In the episode, Brendan was seen returning home to find Lynsey dead on the sofa. Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy reported that the \\"dramatic cliffhanger\\" would start a whodunit storyline, as many characters had a motive to kill Lynsey. In the run up to her demise, Lynsey was attempting to discover a secret shared by Ally Gorman (Dan O'Connor) and Walker (Neil Newbon). She also learned that Mercedes had been stalking Mitzeee and stabbed herself to frame her rival and Will Savage (James Atherton) secret story of Silas. Meanwhile, Hollyoaks also reintroduced Silas - leaving viewers unsure if he had murdered her. After Lynsey's exit, Hollyoaks released a promotional image featuring her with the main suspects for the murder; Silas, Mercedes, Will, Sampson (Sean Cernow), Walker and Ally. Hassan said that she was often asked if she planned to stay with the serial and although she already knew she was leaving she had to \\"play along with things\\" and keep her exit a secret to maintain the \\"big shock factor\\" she wanted. The actress had previously misled the press, telling a reporter from What's on TV that she was happy to stay at Hollyoaks for the foreseeable future. In May, when questioned by an OK! columnist whether she planned to stay with the serial, Hassan had replied that when her contract ran out in August she would have to see what happens. Having hoped for a dramatic exit storyline, Hassan was happy with her character's demise. While saddened by the nature of such a storyline, filming intense final scenes proved enjoyable for Hassan. She also teased the audience with the revelation that Hollyoaks had not actually aired Lynsey's final on-screen appearance. She touted the scenes as \\"really juicy, [...] very traumatic and tumultuous\\" and refused to confirm whether they would be depicted as flashbacks or previous events in Lynsey's life. But she noted that viewers would have \\"the ending they were looking for\\". Hassan knew the identity of Lynsey's murderer, but remained secretive to protect the conclusion of the storyline. When viewers tuned into the episode broadcast on 17 August 2012, they were met with the identity of the perpetrator, Doctor Browning. Storylines Lynsey is upset when she discovers that her ex-boyfriend Kris, who she still has feelings for, is bisexual and a crossdresser. However, she forgives Kris.

When Malachy is injured in a fire, Lynsey says goodbye before his life support is switched off. Lynsey dates widower Gilly but Lynsey ends their relationship when he is accused of raping Jacqui. When Lynsey gives sexual health advice via a college radio, she angers Silas who prevents her receiving a promotion.

Silas steals her ring but when Riley hears her screams he leaves. Upon hearing Silas' voice, Lynsey accuses him of being her attacker. Riley refuses to believe Lynsey and due to lack of evidence the police do not investigate. Lynsey and Texas begin to question whether Silas is responsible for India's murder. When searching Silas' belongings for her ring, Lynsey is interrupted by Riley and returns home to discover her ring has been returned. Texas makes Riley doubt Silas' innocence and when Lynsey accuses Silas of murdering India, Riley questions Silas. Silas collapses with a heart attack and is taken to hospital where Lynsey is assigned as Silas' nurse. Assuming he is faking a heart attack, Lynsey removes his oxygen mask and questions Silas about his innocence. Silas' daughter Heidi finds Lynsey withholding treatment from Silas and calls for help leading to Lynsey being suspended. Lynsey gives Cheryl some diet pills, which Silas replaces with his heart medication. Cheryl falls, knocking herself unconscious which leads to the discovery of sedatives in her system. Silas tells Cheryl that Lynsey could have given her the sedatives, making her doubt Lynsey's state of her mind. Silas follows Texas to the woods where he plans to murder her when Lynsey and Nancy interrupt him. Lynsey notifies Detective Constable Ethan Scott (Craig Vye) but he does not believe Lynsey's claims. Lynsey steals India's necklace from Texas before planting it on Silas. She notifies the police before Texas discovers her plan, forcing her to confess. Silas warns Lynsey that now her plan has failed she should be worried. Lynsey leaves the village temporarily. Brendan begins to believe Lynsey's claims and warns Silas. Lynsey returns to learn Texas has been corresponding with a girl online, who Lynsey realises is actually Silas. Lynsey arranges to meet the correspondent in the woods with Nancy although Silas sends Nancy to meet a journalist. Lynsey arrives in the woods alone, unaware Nancy is not coming. When Lynsey goes missing, Brendan goes to the woods in search of her. Brendan is arrested after the discovery of Rae's body in his car and Lynsey returns to learn of this. Cheryl evicts Lynsey and she moves in with Jacqui. Lynsey hits Silas over the head with a rock and believing him to be dead tells Ethan although when they arrive Silas is gone and later denies all knowledge of the attack. Silas sets Lynsey the challenge of guessing his next victim before Halloween although if she fails he will kill the intended victim. Lynsey attacks Silas following his taunts and is arrested for GBH and although she is issued a warning, she is released. Lynsey convinces Doug of Silas' plan and together they narrow down the possible victims. Silas sends Lynsey a Catwoman costume to wear to the Chez Chez Halloween party. Lynsey is thrown out of the party after trying to convince the guests that a murder is going to take place. When Lynsey returns home, Silas confronts her, confessing that she is his intended victim and that if he were to kill Lynsey he would confess to the police. Lynsey agrees to die but smashes a vase over Silas' head and runs out the flat. Silas kills a woman in a Catwoman costume, believing her to be Lynsey, although he discovers he has killed Heidi. Lynsey and Riley discover Silas' victim's rings and Mercedes' engagement ring, leading to Silas being arrested. Silas refuses to reveal Mercedes' location, saying that he wants Lynsey as she is an opponent he has a rapport. Silas and Lynsey exchange taunts which angers Silas in to revealing Mercedes location. Mercedes gives birth and Lynsey visits Silas for a final time, telling him that he is just a sad old man that no longer has any hold over her and that she can finally sleep soundly. She leaves, relieved her ordeal is over. Lynsey gains her friends back and she and Cheryl become friends again. Lynsey damages her friendship with Mercedes when she begins a relationship with Riley, which ends because of his feelings for Mitzeee. The latter accuses Lynsey of being a stalker which results in Mercedes being stabbed during a confrontation with Mitzeee. She realises that Mercedes stabbed herself and stalked Mitzeee because of her involvement with Riley. Lynsey is also threatened by Walker and Ally after she becomes suspicious about their shared past. Brendan finds her dead and a murder investigation is launched with Mercedes, Ally and Walker amongst the suspects. Jacqui exposes Doctor Browning as the perpetrator - during flashbacks he kills Lynsey because she discovered Mercedes' vendetta against Mitzeee. Walker is present at the murder and does not prevent it in order to conceal an undercover police operation that she discovers. Lynsey appears as an apparition in Silas' mind and following her funeral, Doctor Browning pleading not guilty to charges of murder. At Christmas, Doctor Browning turns up at Mercedes' door and explains that he was cleared of murdering Lynsey after blaming Riley Costello (Rob Norbury). A year later in September 2013, Riley's name is cleared when Doctor Browning confesses to Lynsey's murder after being arrested for shooting Myra McQueen. Myra actually faked her death with a bullet proof vest and flees the country so Doctor Browning would be sent down and therefore kept away from Mercedes. In 2016, more than four years after her death, Silas told Lindsey Roscoe (Sophie Austin) that she loved her name, as he knew Lynsey before. Reception Both Hassan and her character earned several award nominations. In a poll run by E4 to find the Best Bits of 2011, Lynsey was voted Hero of the Year. In Digital Spy's end of year reader's poll for 2011, the Silas plot, including his feud with Lynsey, won Best Soap Storyline. Kilkelly of Digital Spy also chose Lynsey and Silas' Halloween showdown as one of his favourite moments of Hollyoaks in 2011. At the 2012 British Soap Awards, Hassan received a nomination for Best Actress. She was also nominated for Best Actress at the Inside Soap Awards. In the same year, the Halloween episode in which Lynsey's game with Silas concluded won Best Episode at the All About Soap Awards. Sarah Ellis, writing for Inside Soap, described Lynsey as \\"Hollyoakss very own Miss Marple\\". A reporter from the Sunday Mercury commented that Lynsey should have left Silas alone, saying \\"Surely she realises that exposing a killer is a lethal business?\\" Another reporter from the same paper noted that Lynsey \\"foolishly\\" met Silas in the woods despite knowing he was a murderer. A Western Mail stated \\"Lynsey's not going to stop until she's put herself in an early grave. Determined to expose Silas as a murderer, she's like a dog with a bone, intent on making sure he gets his comeuppance\\". Another Sundary Mercury writer said that Lynsey was \\"very foolish to take part\\" in Silas' challenge to guess who his next victim would be. The Liverpool Echos Dawn Collinson thought that the plot was full of suspense, \\"nail-biting hour after hour of it\\", before adding that it was gripping. Anthony D. Langford from AfterElton commented that Hassan's performance as Lynsey throughout the storyline was \\"effective\\" although he believed that her character had become a \\"little too whiny at times\\". An OK! columnist said that Lynsey and Mercedes are \\"the unlikeliest couple of 'bessie mates'\\" in the serial, but felt the pair proved themselves to be \\"Merseyside's version of Thelma and Louise!\\" Lynsey's death shocked Laura Morgan from All About Soap, who could not believe that she was writing about her death. She felt that it was so unexpected she would never have foreseen the scenario \\"in a million years\\". Sarah Ellis from rival magazine Inside Soap shared Morgan's sentiments, branding it \\"the mother of all shocks\\". Ellis said that she did not see it coming and concluded that she would miss Lynsey, who was on the path of becoming one of her \\"favourite Hollyoaks characters\\". Heat columnist Sophie Wilkinson felt that the episode dealing with the aftermath of Lynsey's death was a \\"shocker\\" and questioned \\"Who could kill butter-wouldn't-melt nurse Lynsey?\\" Langford also expressed shock at her exit, saying that soaps rarely ever surprise him due to there predictability. He wrote that he did not \\"see Lynsey's death coming because it was so sudden. One moment she was there and the next she was gone. It was swift and out of nowhere, yet her death not only made perfect sense, it has galvanized this show in a way that has been missing for so long. Because of Lynsey's death, various disparate storylines and plots are finally coming together under one intriguing umbrella arc\\". Hassan told Digital Spy's Kilkelly that she had received a high volume of messages via social networking site Twitter in response to her exit. She added that viewers named Lynsey as one of their favourite characters amongst \\"some really nice feedback\\". Hassan's colleagues also paid tribute to her after her exit. Rawle (Silas) called Hassan \\"brilliant\\" during their \\"very strong\\" scenes, while Waugh (Cheryl) stated that the \\"phenomenal\\" Hassan could \\"make the audience laugh and cry in equal measure\\". Fox (Nancy) said that Lynsey had been at the core of the serial's \\"best storylines\\". Metcalfe (Mercedes) called her an \\"absolute [professional]\\", while Cooper (Jacqui) commented that she was a \\"generous\\" actress to work with.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=420640 on 2015-02-24  Distribution  The coffee bean snail is found on both coasts of Florida and throughout the Caribbean.  Description  The maximum recorded shell length is 23 mm.Welch J. J. (2010). \\"The \\"Island Rule\\" and Deep-Sea Gastropods: Re-Examining the Evidence\\". PLoS ONE 5(1): e8776. .  Ecology  Minimum recorded depth is -0.3 m. Maximum recorded depth is 0.3 m. This small snail is commonly found in the intertidal zone of mangroves amongst the roots and branches. It is similar in appearance to Melampus bidentatus and the two are often confused. Melampus bidentatus is slightly larger and is more likely to be found in a salt marsh as opposed to mangrove habitat for Melampus coffea. Like other species of Melampus, the coffee bean snail is one of the few pulmonate snails to reproduce via planktonic larvae called veligers (Ruppert & Barnes 1994). Upon hatching, the veligers will spend between 4‚Äì6 weeks in the plankton, and then return to the mangroves on a high tide, and metamorphose into juvenile snails. This species is a detritivore and herbivore, foraging upon fresh and decaying mangrove leaf litter. The coffee bean snail engages in vertical migration leading up to the time of high tide, in order to escape inundation and the increased risk of predation by various fish species.Andrews, J. 1994.

Playing from Ynys Field (later Aberdare Athletic Ground) in Aberdare, the club was one of the first professional Welsh teams, formed in 1908 but folded after just a single season. Club history =Formation= At the beginning of the 20th century, rugby union was the sport of choice for most villages and towns.R League: The day Wales made history Wales Online, 23 December 2007 The sport was strictly amateur and players were not expected to receive any monies for taking part in the sport. If players were to be discovered taking payments, they and their club could be permanently suspended. The problem facing Welsh rugby was the rise of the professional Northern Union (later rugby league) in the North of England, where several clubs had split away from the International Rugby Board and formed their own league where players were paid to play. Many rugby union clubs found their star players poached from them by the new Northern League. To prevent losing their star players, many rugby union clubs secretly paid their players a small amount of money for each match played. The first challenge of the professional era to face the Welsh Rugby Union came in 1907 when E.M. Rees, the ex-Secretary of Aberdare RFC, made claims in the press that his club made player payments.Smith (1880), pg. 180 Rees made three claims in total, firstly that all players at his former club were receiving hidden wages, secondly that Aberdare had received a payment of ¬£15 from rivals Treorchy to throw a crucial League match,Lush (1998), pg. 9. and finally that Merthyr Alexandria had demanded a payment of ¬£7 5s to bring his team to play Aberdare.Lush (1998), pg. 19 The most notable player caught up in these allegations was Dai \\"Tarw\\" Jones, an internationally capped player for Wales and hero of the 1905 encounter with New Zealand. Jones was originally a player for Treherbert, but had switched to Aberdare, and he and his fellow players were being paid 10s a match. When Aberdare came into financial problems, they cut the illegal payments to 5s, and Jones promptly switched back to Treherbert. The WRU held an investigation into all the allegations, and the sub-committees final report, published in September 1907 found Aberdare and Treorchy guilt of professionalism and permanently suspended the entire Aberdare and Treorchy committees, and then permanent suspended eight players from the sport of rugby union, including Dai Jones. These events gave the impetus for clubs sympathetic to the Northern Union the chance to split from the WRU and become professional. It seemed likely that Aberdare and E.M. Rees would be the first to form a league team, but they failed to obtain financial backing or the use of a pitch,Lush (1998), pg. 28 and instead Ebbw Vale and Merthyr Tydfil were the first to form teams in 1907. The catalyst for the formation of a Northern Union team in Aberdare occurred on 1 January 1908, when the Northern Union hired Ynys Park in Aberdare to host the first true international rugby league match, contested between Wales and New Zealand. A crowd of 15000 attended with gate receipts of ¬£560. The commercial potential was realised by a group of 'tradesman and sportsmen', who met in Aberdare in March 1908 and guaranteed a sum of ¬£150 to form a Northern Union club. The prime mover in the formation of the club was Llewellyn Deere, a former Mountain Ash union player who turned professional with Huddersfield in 1900. In 1908 Deere became the Landlord of the Locomotive Inn in Aberdare, and it was he who set about forming the club. A limited company was formed with a share capital of ¬£500 and Deere was made company secretary, while Ted Ruther became chairman. On 21 July 1908, Deere attended a Northern Rugby League Committee meeting, and Aberdare, along with Barry were admitted.Lush (1998), pg. 29 =1908/1909 season= Aberdare's first match was played on 5 September 1908, when Wigan travelled to Ynys Park. A crowd of 3000 paid to watch the game. Wigan was ruthless, and it was reported that Aberdare 'evidenced a decided weakness in their application of the rules', as they lost the game 56-0, Wigan running in 12 tries without reply. A visit to St. Helens two weeks later saw Aberdare score their first League points, but still lost 13-36.Lush (1998), pg. 258 Worse was to come when they lost to fellow newly formed Welsh team Treherbert away from home, then in the return match the very next week they lost again in front of fewer than 300 spectators. The arrival of Wakefield Trinity drew a better crowd on 17 October, but the 26-0 loss brought Aberdare's losing streak to six games. This was followed by another loss to Merthyr Tydfil before the team recorded their first win in a Welsh League match against Treherbert. The 9 November 1908 saw the arrival of the second international team at Ynys Park, the first touring Australian team. The tour match against Aberdare drew a crowd of 5000Kangaroo Tour: 1908-1909 rl1908.com on a Monday afternoon, and the tourists ran out 37-10 winners. The very next match gave Aberdare their first and only win in the Northern Rugby League a massive 43-5 win over fellow strugglers Barry, though Barry had revenge on 12 December when they knocked Aberdare out of the Challenge Cup in the first round. Aberdare's season did not improve after the Barry victory in the League, and they went on to lose ten of their remaining 12 games. Of the games they won, both were in the Welsh League, and these were against Treherbert and Barry.Lush (1998), pg. 259 After crowd numbers failed to improve, Aberdare even tried switching grounds, playing their home encounter with St Helens at Merthyr's College Field. Though there was very little interest in the game and numbers remained poor. Towards the end of the season, Aberdare were expected to travel to West Yorkshire to face Wakefield, but the Wakefield committee failed to meet Aberdare's request for an advance of ¬£15 to cover travelling costs. Wakefield believing the gate receipts would be so low, they wouldn't cover the expenses, and the game never took place. Aberdare finished they first and only season by placing 31st out of 31 clubs in the Rugby Football League, winning one game, drawing none and losing 16. In the Welsh League they fared slightly better coming in fifth out of six, with three wins and no draws from eight matches. The only consolation form the season was when one of their players, Will Hopkins was chosen to play for the Wales national rugby league team. His one and only cap was awarded in the encounter with England on the 28 December 1908. =Club demise= At the end of the season Athletic News branded the four newly formed Welsh clubs, Aberdare, Mid-Rhondda, Barry and Treherbert as 'ignominious failures\\".Lush (1998), pg. 30 Then, in the mid season break, the Northern Rugby League passed a by-law that stated if clubs were in arrears of any kind, the teams would be named defaulters and banned from further competitions. Barry and Aberdare were both cited of this charge. On 8 July 1909, Aberdare told the League that it expected to come out of arrears and would meet its obligations, but two days later the club reported it had 'unexpected difficulties' and resigned from the League. The club never played league rugby again.

It usually occurs between sequences of DNA that have been previously duplicated through evolution, and therefore have low copy repeats (LCRs). These repeat elements typically range from 10‚Äì300 kb in length and share 95-97% sequence identity. During meiosis or mitosis, LCRs can misalign and subsequent crossing-over can result in genetic rearrangement. When non-allelic homologous recombination occurs between different LCRs, deletions or further duplications of the DNA can occur. This can give rise to rare genetic disorders, caused by the loss or increased copy number of genes within the deleted or duplicated region. It can also contribute to the copy number variation seen in some gene clusters. As LCRs are often found in \\"hotspots\\" in the human genome, some chromosomal regions are particularly prone to NAHR. Recurrent rearrangements are nucleotide sequence variations found in multiple individuals, sharing a common size and location of break points. Therefore, multiple patients may manifest with similar deletions or duplications, resulting in the description of genetic syndromes. Examples of these include NF1 microdeletion syndrome, 17q21.3 recurrent microdeletion syndrome or 3q29 microdeletion syndrome.

After all the organizational changes and staff rearrangements it will replace the Israel Land Administration. History \\"The Basic Law: Israel Lands\\" establishes the principle that Israel Lands are nationally owned, and they can only be leased, not sold. Thus, land buyers are granted only lessee's rights, formally not full ownership rights. Based on this law and several other laws, the Israel Land Administration was created in 1960. It's an organization supervising the proper use of lands in the public domain and managing some 93% of Israeli lands. Starting from the beginning of the 2000s there is an ongoing debate including governmental officials whether different issues arising from the national ownership of the land can be solved. On July 12, 2003 and on February 4, 2004 the Constitution, Law, and Justice Committee met as the committee for the Constitution by Broad Consensus to discuss this problem.Israel Land Authority Debate Several academic experts have challenged the necessity to keep 93% of public lands owned by the state, Professor Hanoch Dagan of Tel Aviv University and Professor Rachelle Alterman of Technion - Israel Institute of Technology among them. They noted that the law allows certain exceptions to the prohibition on selling state lands and suggested that there is no need in changing (constitutional) basic laws ‚Äì these exceptions could be broadened by ordinary legislation. According to Professor Joshua Weisman of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem a leaser's rights are equal to that of the owner. This is because: # The leases granted by the Israel Lands Authority are long-term ‚Äì usually two terms of 49 years. # The amount paid for leases is very close to the market price for full ownership. # The state does not actually repossess its land when the leases run out. He also believes that the main principle of the Basic Law: Israel Lands should remain unchanged since it is one of the fundamental features of the Israeli legal system. Another reason is that Israel is a small country with limited land reserves. Land reform Influenced by this debate, in April 2009 Israeli Ministry of Finance has issued a paper offering basic reforms for Israeli economy in 2009-2010. It recommended ‚Äúto pass the law on the land ownership to let all lessees holding lease contracts for housing and employment (gain full ownership rights).‚Äù It was suggested to create a new government agency for this purpose ‚Äì Israel Land Authority. The reform should start from urban lands, but some parts of this paper also noted the importance of privatizing agricultural lands. Financial experts of the ministry saw Israel Land Administration is the main impediment for the economic development of the state since main economic activities depend upon the flexibility of the land reserves. These changes were implemented in the Arrangements Law of 2009 including a section called ‚ÄúIsrael Lands Reform‚Äù. This reform was a part of the privatization process of the ILA and it was heavily criticized by the public. =Reform's components= # Granting ownership rights to leaseholders of real estate designated for residence and employment on the urban lands; # Comprehensive internal organizational change of the Israel Land Administration and turning it into the Israel Land Authority. =Reform's objectives= * Reducing the number of bureaucratic impediments and lowering the costs for housing and small business owners - ownership rights granted will reduce the dependence of land owners from the ILA; * Increasing the stock of land for construction; * Focusing on reaching ILA's objectives - the reduced number of leaseholders will reduce the number of clients for treatment and it will help concentrate on other important issues; * Environment protection and the protection of open-spaced territories through the construction densification and maintaining underdeveloped land reserves for the future generations; * Giving benefit for the middle class and lower - granting ownership rights for free to the leaseholders in the center of the country and also in the periphery; * Protecting national interests. Creation In August 2009, the Knesset passed an Israel Land Authority Law that allows people to own land property in Israel, rather than lease it.Amnon Meranda, Knesset green-lights land reform, Ynetnews, August 03, 2009 According to the law, land privatization will be divided into two steps, with a team of ministers examining the reform.Israeli Land Reform Bill Passes , [Jewish Telegraphic Agency], August 3, 2009 As a part of the same legislature and as a part of the land reform Israeli Land Authority was created. Under the reform some 200,000 acres of state-owned land, comprising 4% of total Israeli lands, will be sold to private buyers, including homeowners, developers and kibbutzim. It will speed development plans, bring more housing quickly to market and thus help reduce soaring housing prices and boost Israeli economy.Daniella Cheslow, Land reform to privatize parts of Jewish state , Jewish Telegraphic Agency, August 05, 2009 Municipalities will gain more power in land allocation and development.Dotan Levy, Is ILA reform a good thing?, Ynetnews, May 20, 2009 According to the official governmental press-release, \\"The reforms are designed to reduce bureaucratic impediments for homeowners who wish to enlarge their homes and the involvement of the Government in the real estate market, and enable the ILA to focus on developing and marketing state lands, as opposed to dealing with leased residential units.\\"Israel Land Administration Reforms Underway, Prime Minister's Office, October 6, 2010 The reforms are meant to offer a greater supply of residential units that would cause housing prices to decline. Upon the agreement reached after negotiations were held between ILA management, Ministry of Finance and Trade unions, some 200 of ILA staff will leave their job voluntarily, as for the rest they will be embedded in the structure of a new Israel Land Authority organization. Israel Land Authority‚Äôs objectives According to the Amendment 7 (2009) of the Israel Land Administration Law (1960), ILA‚Äôs objectives are as follows. * Managing Israeli lands as a resource for development of the State of Israel in the interest of the public, environment and for the future generations, leaving sufficient land reserves for this purpose and for the development of the country in the future, with a proper balance between the needs in conservation for development and the marketing of land to maintain land reserves for public purposes. * Promoting competition in the land market and preventing concentration of land holdingsIsrael Land Authority‚Äôs objectives (Hebrew) Israel Land Authority‚Äôs functions According to the Amendment 7 (2009) of the Israel Land Administration Law (1960), ILA‚Äôs functions are as follows. * Allocation of land for housing, affordable housing, public housing, employment, open space allotments and for other purposes in locations and amounts required for the needs of economy, society and environment, including future needs; * Land acquisition and land expropriation for the state according to the law, primarily for environmental purposes; * Protection of rights of land owners in Israel; * Promotion of registration of real estate rights in the Land books of Israel; * Provision of services to the landholders in Israel as required for management and implementation of their rights; * Publication of information about Israeli lands, including details on agreements made by the Authority regarding lands it manages, and data on the availability of planned Israeli lands for development and maintenance of open space territory; * Any other function related to the Israel land management imposed upon it by law or by any governmental decision.

The port is officially in Beni Ensar / A√Øt Nsar and shares its piers and entrance with the port of the Spanish enclave Melilla. It is a semi-artificial port using the Bou Areg Lagoon.World Port Source about Port Nador, retrieved 10 June 2012 Usage The port is directly connected to the Spanish enclave Melilla: the Port of Melilla uses approximately 70% of the wet area, while Nador port uses the remaining 30% of the south-east area. The port is used as ferry/ro-ro port, dry-bulk and has facilities for hydro-carbons. The ro-ro facilities are used by ferry operators on the route to/from Spain. In 1994 the operator FerriMaroc opened the line to the Port of Almeria. Before that date one could only sail to the area via Melilla or via the ferry-terminal in Al Hoceima. Facilities The operator MarsaMaroc, who operate the main ports in Morocco, offer the following facilities in Nador Port The port can be divided in three main parts: =Terminal 2= The main good terminal has 700 metres of deep- water keys (13 metre deep) and another 300 metre keys with a water-depth of 10 metres. This Terminal 2 is a bulk goods terminal receiving bulk-goods such as ore and billets for the nearby steel-mill SONASID and is also used as (small) fishing port. A total of 14,7 hectare land-area is available for storing or moving goods. =Passengers and vehicle piers= Nador Port is now an important ferry terminal for North-Eastern Morocco with direct daily links to Spain (Almeria and Motril) and weekly connection to France (Sete) For ferries operating to Europe the port offers 600 meter keys for Roll- on/roll-off ferries with elevated foot-bridges for foot-passengers to cross the car-traffic on different levels and thus not hindering each other at (dis)embarkation with also 13 meter depth. =Hydrocarbon port= Finally there is a 100 metre long pier for reception of hydrocarbons with a waterdepth of 13 metres.

The book is the first full-length study of Van Morrison's work which does not claim to be a biography. Mills focusses completely on the music, and also casts light on parts of Morrison's songbook that are usually skipped over in career-overviews and synopses. He concentrates especially on a number of case studies of key albums, particularly on Veedon Fleece, Into the Music and Common One. The book contains interviews with several artists including Ben Sidran, Kevin Rowland (of Dexys Midnight Runners), Folk singer Kate Rusby and Maria McKee. Like Ben Sidran, Mills is a musician as well as a writer so the book offers insight from inside the music as well as in-depth scrutiny of records and shows. The book covers Morrison's musical debt to America, his 'Irishness', his approach to live work, analyses of studio recordings from Them right through to the present day and a whole chapter devoted to a study of Morrison as a singer and a musician.

The Nepalese in South Korea are mainly of four distinct ethnic groups : Bahun (Brahmins), Chhetri (Rajputs), Madhesis and Janjatis. Migration history The first wave of Nepalese immigration began in the late 1980s. After Nepal restored its democracy in the 1990s, labour laws were changed to allow Nepalese youths to go abroad in search of work. The Nepalese community in South Korea thus consists primarily of migrant workers, but also has large numbers of students as well as Nepalese women married to South Korean men they met through international matchmaking agencies. The Nepali government are attempting to induce Nepali workers staying illegally in South Korea (roughly 2,500 ) to return home, in hopes that the South Korean government will increase its intake of Nepali workers in future years. Culture The Nepalese community managed to keep their traditions alive while living in South Korea. Nepalese festivals such as Tihar, Dasain and Teej are celebrated throughout the country. Organisations The Non-Resident Nepali Association of Korea is one organisation for Nepalese people living in South Korea. In 2010, they opened a shelter in Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul to provide charitable assistance for Nepalese who become unemployed or otherwise face difficulties. Another organisation, aimed specifically at international students, is the Society of Nepalese Students in Korea (SONSIK), established in 2004. South Korea's multilingual Migrant Workers' Television was founded by Nepali migrant worker Minod Moktan (Minu), a human rights activist who lived in South Korea for nearly 18 years before being deported in October 2009.

Career  Albert Ganzenm√ºller had taken part in the Munich Beer Hall Putsch in November 1923 while still at Realgymnasium (secondary high school). Afterwards, he became a holder of the Blood Order of the German Nazi Party. After graduating from the Technical College in Munich (now Technical University Munich), where he was a member of a student fraternity known as the Corps Rheno-Palatia M√ºnchen, he became an executive with the Deutsche Reichsbahn (German State Railways) in 1931 and joined the Nazi Party and the Sturmabteilung (SA or ‚Äúbrownshirts‚Äù). In 1940, he had reached the rank of colonel on the staff of the SA supreme command. He held a doctorate degree in Engineering. In 1934 Ganzenm√ºller became a senior railway executive (Reichsbahn-Rat) in Munich and in 1938 was appointed Senior Government Adviser (Oberregierungsrat). He was subsequently head (Dezernent) of electrical engineering at the central office of the German State Railways in Munich. In 1940 he took over the repair and renewal of the electric railway network in occupied France. The following year, at his own request, he was transferred to the Eastern Division at Poltava in central Ukraine. Ganzenm√ºller quickly restored railroad traffic between Minsk and Smolensk. On the recommendation of Albert Speer in May 1942, Ganzenm√ºller was appointed Deputy General Director of the German State Railways and Under-secretary of State at the Reich Transport Ministry, Dr. Julius Dorpm√ºller.  Involvement in deportations  Corpses of Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto who died inside sealed boxcars of the Reichsbahn before reaching Treblinka extermination camp, August 1942 A sealed boxcar of the Reichsbahn at Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp Removing corpses from death train from Romania Ganzenm√ºller was immediately involved in the organisation of trains for deportation. He collaborated in the transportation scheme for elderly German Jews to Theresienstadt and ensured the smooth running of transport to the extermination camps set up under Operation Reinhardt. On 16 July 1942, Karl Wolff, the Personal Adjutant to Heinrich Himmler, complained to the newly appointed under-secretary about irregular transport and track repairs on the line to the extermination camp at Sobibor. Ganzenm√ºller replied in writing on 28 July 1942 as follows: > A train carrying 5,000 Jews has run daily since 22 July from Warsaw to > Treblinka via Malkinia; furthermore, another train has run twice a week with > 5,000 Jews from Przemysl to Belzec. The senior management of the eastern > division of the railways, ‚ÄòGedob‚Äô (Generaldirektion der Ostbahnen), is in > constant touch with the security service (Sicherheitsdienst) in Krakau. The > latter is in agreement that transport from Warsaw to Sobibor via Lublin > should continue while the reconstruction work on this stretch renders such > movements impossible ([until] approximately October 1942). Karl Wolff thanked him on 13 August 1942 in a personal letter: > ‚Ä¶ I note with particular pleasure from your communication that a train with > 5,000 members of the chosen race has been running daily for 14 days and that > we are accordingly in a position to continue with this population movement > at an accelerated pace. [‚Ä¶] At the beginning of 1943, Himmler approached Ganzenm√ºller directly in order to ensure the pending ‚Äúremoval of Jews‚Äù to the Auschwitz concentration camp. Most of the victims were carried to their deaths by Reichsbahn trains in locked and windowless cattle wagons, with few sanitary arrangements and little or nothing in the way of water or food. The wagons were supposed to carry just 50 persons but were normally packed with 100 to 150 victims, the overcrowding making sitting impossible and increasing their distress. The Holocaust trains were hired by Adolf Eichmann, and the Reichsbahn demanded one-way fares be paid by the victims although children below the age of four were allowed free travel to their deaths. The trains travelled to local death camps in Poland at Chelmno, Belzec, Treblinka, Majdanek and Auschwitz-Birkenau, but the early trains in 1939 and 1940 also travelled to Nazi ghettos in the east, and the victims were usually murdered there by Einsatzgruppen organized by Reinhard Heydrich. Conditions on the Holocaust trains were so bad that many passengers died en route to the death camps especially as it often took many days to reach their destinations. The cattle cars in which the victims were carried were completely unheated in winter and unventilated in hot weather and so the passengers were exposed to either hypothermia or heat stroke. Deaths among the elderly, children and sick were common. To maintain the deception, some passengers were given postcards by the guards to send to their relatives with dictated words about their successful \\"resettlement\\". That decepion continued even to the death camps, such as with a bogus station at Treblinka and Sobibor camps that was complete with signs and flower tubs to reassure the victims who debouched there.  Postwar  Ganzenm√ºller escaped to Argentina via Italy from the interrogation camp in 1945. His denazification process was delayed, and in 1952 an amnesty led to the ending of the case against him. He returned to Germany in 1955 and was employed as a planning engineer for transport matters by Hoesch AG. The public prosecutor's office continued to investigate him after 1957, as the exchange of correspondence with Wolff and Himmler had been discovered and published by the historian, Gerald Reitlinger. Ganzenm√ºller remained on remand for ten weeks but the investigations led only to a preferred charge. In 1973 a case was brought by the regional court at D√ºsseldorf. The charge was that by organising transport the 68-year-old Ganzenm√ºller had aided and abetted the murder of millions of Jewish men, women and children whose wrongful detention had resulted in death. The case was provisionally halted in 1973 because of his inability to follow the case and then terminated altogether in 1977.

This article describes these functions and the corresponding solutions for the orbits. General problem The Binet equation for u(œÜ) can be solved numerically for nearly any central force F(1/u). However, only a handful of forces result in formulae for u in terms of known functions. The solution for œÜ can be expressed as an integral over u : \\\\varphi = \\\\varphi_{0} + \\\\frac{L}{\\\\sqrt{2m}} \\\\int ^{u} \\\\frac{du}{\\\\sqrt{E_{\\\\mathrm{tot}} - V(1/u) - \\\\frac{L^{2}u^{2}}{2m}}} A central-force problem is said to be \\"integrable\\" if this integration can be solved in terms of known functions. If the force is a power law, i.e., if F(r) = Œ± rn, then u can be expressed in terms of circular functions and/or elliptic functions if n equals 1, -2, -3 (circular functions) and -7, -5, -4, 0, 3, 5, -3/2, -5/2, -1/3, -5/3 and -7/3 (elliptic functions).Whittaker, pp. 80-95.

It was built in 1136 and was situated about two miles north of OkehamptonHoskins, W. G., Devon, 1954, p. 447 in Devon and was abandoned by the monks after only 5 years on their removal to a nearby site which became Forde Abbey. History Between 1133 and 1136, Richard FitzBaldwin (d. 1137) (Latinised to de Brioniis/Brionis/Bryonis), feudal baron of Okehampton,Sanders, Ivor, English Baronies, Oxford, 1960, p. 69 built a priory on his land at Brightley, on the bank of the West Okement River, near his caput of Okehampton Castle.Southcott Cross (geograph.org.uk - 31 July 2010). He dedicated it to the Virgin Mary and invited Gilbert, Abbot of Waverley in Surrey, to send 12 monks and an abbot to form a new Cistercian community there.Heath, 1911, pp. 25-27. It appears that the agricultural land surrounding the new priory was insufficiently fertile, forcing the monks to consider abandoning it and returning to the mother house in 1141. However, Adelicia de Brioniis, the sister of Richard (who died in 1137)Wright, 1889, p. 112. and successor to his estate, offered them an alternative site instead on the River Axe in the manor of Thorncombe. Here, between 1141 and 1148, they built a new priory which came to be known as Forde Abbey due to its proximity to an ancient ford across the river. The original site is now a farm but one of the farm outbuildings, a rectangular building running east-west, has considerable remains of an ecclesiastical form. It could possibly have been a chapel.Brightley Abbey (English Heritage pastscape).

After the end of this, a deal was struck with Volkswagen which lasted until 1993. Production of a truck using the Volkswagen LT body started in 1979 and ended in 1993 with 72,000 units produced. It was available with four engines and four wheelbases over its lifetime; there was also a 4X4 version called 8.150 FAE. FAE means \\"forward control\\" cab, all-wheel drive, single tyres so the F nomenclature means \\"forward control\\" cab. This series is usually referred to as the G90, from the most common model, but also as the \\"G\\"-series. In the United Kingdom it was originally marketed as the \\"MAN MT\\" series. The original lineup in the UK consisted of the 6.90 and the 8.90 (the first digit denoting the GVW in tonnes, the second for power in metric horsepower) and the 8.136 and 9.136. MAN AG supplied engines which were available in inline-four and inline-six cylinder engine configurations, with DIN rated motive power outputs of:  * MAN replaced the G series with the L2000 and M2000 ranges. Several models of the MAN-VWCV and the VWCV LT ranges were marketed in Spain by Enasa as Pegaso Ekus, in a typical badge engineering operation. Peterbilt also offered this model with their badging, as the 200 or 265 model. VWCV and MAN shared the project development in accordance with the collaboration agreement as follows: Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles took care of: *the tilting driver's cab including steering wheel and fixing, hand levers and foot pedals.cabins so they can fit the truck chassis *the complete interior equipment and heating *the manual gearbox with clutch and gear lever, the rear axle with rear-axle transmission and suspension *the Cardan shafts including bearings *the electrical system for the entire concept, and the platforms for the standard design. MAN was responsible for: *the engine including cooling, exhaust, inlet and fuel system *the front axle with suspension and steering *the frame with all parts for attaching the springs and axles, the steering, the batteries, the power braking system and fuel system *the brakes, i.e. for the complete wheel brakes front and rear, the dual-circuit power brakes and parking brake *the wheels and tyres *the platform for special designs and tipping mechanism.

In The Serious Representation (which he wrote in 1649 while a prisoner in Oxford), he states that in the middle of the 1630s he was forced to leave England for New-England because he opposed the Service Book. cites Eyre, Serious Representation, 1‚Äì2) First Civil War In 1642 Eyre was a sergeant in Denzil Holles's regiment, and fought at Battle of Edgehill. Just over three weeks later he was with the regiment when it was destroyed by a detachment of the Royalist army under the command of Prince Rupert at Battle of Brentford. Eyre joined the Eastern Association and was commissioned by Oliver Cromwell a quartermaster in his own troop. Shortly afterwards he was promoted to captain of the sixth troop in Cromwell's regiment of horse (the famous Ironside). He fought under Cromwell in the Lincolnshire campaign of 1643. When the Parliamentary army left Sleaford on 13 January 1644, Eyre's troop along with two others were left to secure the country around the town. But later that month his troop and two others were captured after a being surprised by Royalists while they slept. His relationship with Cromwell deteriorated as their political views diverged and Eyre resigned his commission that summer. Marriage and property in Ireland, 1647 In 1647 Eyre married Mary, n√©e Leycester, who had outlived two previous husbands, Calcott Chambre (or Culvert Chambers) and of Job Ward. Chambre's father had bought the half-barony of Shillelagh and Carnew Castle in County Wicklow, Ireland, so through his marriage to Chambre's widow, Eyre now acquired a right to this property. He now had an interest in property in Ireland, and Sir Thomas Fairfax nominated Eyre to be a colonel of a regiment of foot in the Parliamentary expeditionary force to be sent to Ireland. Corkbush Field rendezvous, 1647 On 17 November 1647, although his regiment was not part of the New Model Army, Eyre attended the Corkbush Field rendezvous in Hampshire and when he incited the troops to accept the Leveller's Agreement of the People he was arrested for inciting mutiny. He, and fellow levellers arrested at the same time, were hailed as martyrs by their supporters. The ordinary soldiers were tried and sentenced at a court martial on 3 December. Eyre's trial along with other officers was postponed. Eyre was never tried because he agreed to submit to military discipline and on 23 December he was allowed to return to his regiment which was cantoned in Worcestershire. Second English Civil War =Broadway meeting, 1648= In January 1648 Eyre attended the Broadway meeting where 80 officers of five regiments to discuss their men's grievances foremost of which is back pay. It is possible that the officers discussed plans for a mutiny and to pre-empt this, or for other reasons, in February Eyre's regiment was disband. =Henry Marten's Regiment in Berkshire, 1648= After the disbanding of his regiment, Eyre moved to Berkshire and aided Henry Marten (Eyre's farm was adjacent to Marten's estate), a member of the Berkshire county committee to raise a regiment of cavalry. The regiment was unauthorised by Parliament, but as the country was in the midst of the Second Civil War, Marten and Eyre ignored summons from Parliament and refused to appear in Westminster in person to explain themselves. The regiment was reported in the Mercurius Pragmaticus (a knowledgeable contemporary newspaper) said that the regiment claimed to be \\"for the people's freedom against all tyrants whatsoever\\" and were 1,500 strong, made up of serving Leveller troopers encouraged to leave (desert) their regiments for this unofficial one, and local yeomen farmers. They equipped themselves in various ways including they said requisitioning arms, ammunition and mounts from known delinquents such as Lord Craven. One of the victims of this unauthorised requisitioning was Sir Humphrey Foster. He named Eyre as one of the Offices involved in the requisitioning of this property, for which he had three men arrayed before the Assizes in Wiltshire. This move came to nothing when the men brandishing their swords refused to recognise the legitimacy of the arrayment. Over the next few months the regiment was active in supporting the New Model Army and with his Presbetryan enemies purged by Pride the members of the Rump Parliament commissioned Marten's regiment into the New Model Army. Commonwealth Henry Marten had made some political moves that protected him against charges ordering the billeting of men without authorisation, however Eyre failed to persuade Fairfax, the Lord General of the New Model Army, that he had Cromwell's permission to do the same. In February 1649 after Fairfax turned down Eyre offer to take his three troops of horse to Ireland, he ordered the disbanding of the troops and Eyre's decommissioning. =Burford mutiny, 1649= In May 1649 Eyre, who was now a civilian, took part in the Leveller-influenced Burford mutiny. He joined with the Salisbury mutineers and was captured at an inn in Burford on the night that Cromwell captured the Banbury mutineers at Burford Church. Eyre justified his actions in front of Fairfax and Cromwell by saying \\"if ... but ten men appeared for [the cause] , I would make eleven\\" citing Eyre's in Serious Representation Three days later Eyre was taken to Oxford and placed in its prison. =Imprisonment in Oxford and Warwick, and residency in Ireland= In July 1649, the Council of State was aware of unrest that would lead to the Oxford Mutiny; and not wishing to have a known mutineer in the area, ordered Eyre's transfer to Warwick Castle. While imprisoned there Eyre wrote to the Council of State recognising that he had made mistakes and had been misled; and requested that he might be given permission to join his family in Ireland. After spending about a year in Warwick, Eyre was released from prison on 1 August 1650. From there Eyre travelled to Ireland, and with the help of Henry Ireton, the Lord Deputy of Ireland, he gained possession of Shillelagh. Protectorate By 1654 Eyre had left Ireland for London and was conspiring with his old Leveller companions against the Protectorate. On returning to Ireland he was arrested and justified his plotting by referring to the principles in the Solemn Engagement of 1647 agreed to by himself, Ireton (the probable author of the engagement), and Cromwell. He said that although he loved and honoured the Lord Protector Cromwell even he could be corrupted by power., cites: Thurloe, 3.35 After several months when it became clear that the authorities were going to hold him indefinitely without trial he applied to join Robert Venables's expedition, then at Hispaniola. But his application was turned down and he remain in incarcerated until the end of the protectorate. While he was in prison a number of civil suits were entered against his claim to the Shillelagh and Carnew Castle estates. Restoration =Nine years in prison= Eyre was briefly at liberty during the period of the restored Commonwealth of 1659. But was rearrested in May 1660 as a threat to the restored monarchy of Charles II. While being held in Dublin Castle he was accused of trying to foment a mutiny among the Irish foot guards, and while there was not enough evidence to try him for treason, the new regimen decided that he was too dangerous to release and was held in various prisons for the next nine years. =Appeals for recovery of his Irish estates= Eyre was released in December 1669, and with his daughter travelled to London to present his claim to the Shillelagh and Carnew Castle estates to parliament and King Charles. He published two appeals, the first was The Case of William Eyres, Esq. in which he accused the Earl of Strafford, C. Chambre, J. and Nathaniel Fiennes, J. Crew, Sir Philip Percival, the Countess of Carlisle, Leycester of Cheshire, J. Carpenter, H. Wentworth, Col. Jos. Temple, and others of illegally obtaining the estates comprising upwards of , while he was in prison. The second was titled A Particular Deduction of the Case of William Eyre, and described what Eyre considered his right to the Barony of Shelah and Castle of Carnow, in the County of Wicklow, that was in the possession of 2nd Earl of Strafford. The Earl of Strafford claimed that The Case of William Eyres, Esq. had libelled both himself and his father, and presented it as evidence to the House of Lords' Privileges Committee in May 1675. This is the last historical record of Eyre's life; there is no known record of what action if any the Privileges Committee took and of the rest of Eyre's life and death.Calendar of State Papers, domestic series, of the reign of Charles II, 1660-1685 Bibliography *The serious representation of Col.

Most often found growing at the base of oak trees, it causes white rot and decay of the trunks. It secretes an amber liquid which weeps from tubes in its upper surface. Description A close-up of the fruit body showing its exudate. The thick fruiting body of Inonotus dryadeus varies in size from 5 cm to 30 cm in width, although specimens up to 75 cm have been found. Its velvety upper surface is cream to rusty brown with a yellower margin, and is pitted with tubes up to 3 cm deep which ooze an orange-brown liquid when the fruit body is young, hence the name \\"weeping conk\\". On the buff underside there are 4‚Äì6 fine pores per millimetre. These are initially greyish-white but mature to yellow or ochre. The flesh is soft and fibrous, yellow-brown in colour and has an unpleasant odour. =Spores= The spores are white, smooth and globose, with dimensions in the range of 6.5‚Äì8√ó7‚Äì8 Œºm. =Similar species= I. cuticularis grows on beech, sycamore and elm. Habitat and distribution Inonotus dryadeus is a parasitic saprobic fungus, with spores entering wounds on broadleaf trees (predominantly oak, although sometimes maple, elm and chestnut). It grows close to the ground on the trunk, thickly attached, and either singly or in groups. It has been observed in North America and temperate northern Europe, where it is described as widespread but locally common. Fruiting occurs in summer and autumn, but fruit bodies may overwinter and persist for several years, eventually turning black and cracked. Presence of a fruit body may indicate that the mycelium has penetrated and weakened the root crown of the tree.

Obara left a strong mark in education philosophy and on the theories of liberal education, art education and vocational education. In addition to creating his own education theory, Zenjin (or \\"Whole Person\\") Education, he was among the leaders of the New Education Movement in Japan and disseminated in that country the works of earlier reformers such as Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi. He was the founder of the campus Tamagawa Gakuen and for many years president of its university, Tamagawa University. Biography =Personal life= Born to a Samurai family on 8 April 1887 in the Kagoshima Prefecture of Japan, in a village called Kushi, Obara was the grandson of a famous educator. He was adopted into the Ajisaka family in his early childhood after the death of his parents. Obara converted to Christianity in his early adulthood and remained a devout Christian throughout his life. In 1920, he married educator Nobu Takai, who remained his wife until her death six months before his own. In the last months of his life, Obara was diagnosed with disease of the pancreas and hospitalized. He died on 13 December 1977. =Education= Obara studied at Kagoshima Normal School and Hiroshima Higher Normal School before becoming an English teacher at Kagawa Normal School in Shikoku, where he also taught education and psychology. He entered the Kyoto Imperial University in 1915. There, he was influenced by prominent professors in the Kyoto School of philosophy, including Kitaro Nishida and Seiichi Hatano. His first book was published in 1918. Ky√¥iku no Konpon Mondai to shite no Sh√ªky√¥ (\\"Religion as the fundamental problem of education\\") was a retitling of his bachelor's thesis, Sh√ªky√¥ ni yoru Ky√¥iku no Ky√ªsai (\\"The salvation of education through religion\\"), which he had completed the same year. =Professional career= Following his graduation, Obara became the head of the Department of Educational Affairs of the elementary school at Hiroshima Higher Normal. Already involved with the New Education Movement, Obara became the director of the Seijyo Elementary School in 1919. In 1921, Obara joined seven other education reformists (Choichi Higuchi, Kiyomaru Kohno, Kishie Tezuka, Kinshichi Inage, Meikichi Chiba, Heiji Oikawa and Noburu Katakami) in the \\"Eight Educators Educational Advocacy Conference\\". Here he devised his \\"Zenjin (Whole Person) Education\\" philosophy. Influenced by Plato, Erasmus and Swiss education reformer Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, this philosophy promoted a balanced and individualized approach to the development of the student in the six aspects of truth (veritas; academic ideals), goodness (bonum; moral education), beauty (pulchritudo; art education), holiness (sanctitas; religious education), health (sanitas; physical education), and wealth (copia; vocational education). Obara prioritized the first four of these aspects, which he considered \\"absolute values\\", over the final two, which \\"instrumental values\\" were necessary to help achieve the first four but not intrinsically valuable. In the 1920s, Obara founded three schools ‚Äî a junior high school (1922), a kindergarten (1925), and a senior high school (1926) ‚Äî moving all the schools to create the \\"Seijyo Gakuen\\" comprehensive campus in Kinuta. In 1929, wanting a school that would fundamentally embody his personal education philosophies, Obara decided to create a new complex, Tamagawa Gakuen. Beginning with the elementary school, he gradually built up the campus through the university level. Once his multi-generation campus was completed, he opened additional Tamagawa Gakuen in Japan, the United States, and Canada, with campuses in Los Angeles (1930), Kugenuma (1933), Kushi (1948), and Nanaimo (1976). The Tamagawa Gakuen became famous in Japan for its innovative approach to education. Throughout this period, Obara also worked as a publisher, a profession he undertook in 1923 with the founding of his Idea Shoin Press, which was later renamed Tamagawa University Press. In 1928, Obara published The Complete Works of Pestalozzi, popularizing the works of the Swiss reformer in Japan. In the early 1930s, he published a 30-volume encyclopedia for Japanese children, the first such encyclopedia in the nation. From 1967 to 1974, Obara became president of the Japanese section of the UNESCO World Education Fellowship. Throughout his later life, Obara was a frequent lecturer. His works have been collected in 48 volumes. Influence Obara was highly influential in Japanese education in several areas. In his early work, he helped popularize and spread the New Education Movement in Japan. He helped revive Japanese arts education, in significant part a response to his introduction of \\"school drama\\" to the elementary studies at Hiroshima Normal. But his greatest contribution was perhaps his theory on \\"Zenjin Education.\\" Even after the New Education Movement faded in Japan, a result of the rise of militaristic nationalism after the Great Depression, the \\"Zenjin Education\\" philosophy retained its influence. Since the early 1970s, it has been part of the Japanese Ministry of Education's general guidelines. From the publication of his first book, Obara's work was underscored by his belief that all education should derive from religious education, without which he feared academic education would fail to fully develop the student. Though Obara was a Christian, his religious instruction drew on a variety of religious and moral traditions. He took an equally global view to other elements of education, believing that international education was an important aspect of world peace. He invited a wide variety of international educators to visit his Tamagawa Gakuen campuses. Honors Obara was internationally honored for his work, receiving among other recognition the Royal Order of Commander of the Dannebrog, Knight, bestowed during his 1975 visit to Denmark with his wife.

His grandmother was a niece of sociologist Emile Durkheim and a much younger first cousin of anthropologist Marcel Mauss.\\"Interview of Maurice Bloch\\": Maurice Bloch interviewed by Alan Macfarlane on 29 May 2008 Maurice attended the Lyc√©e Carnot in Paris. His father was killed by the Nazis while in the French Army. When Maurice was eleven, his widowed mother married British biologist John S. Kennedy, whom she had met at a conference. She and her son moved to England to join Kennedy, and Bloch became a British citizen, attending The Perse School in Cambridge. He studied as an undergraduate at the London School of Economics, attending lectures at the School of Oriental and African Studies. He continued his training in anthropology at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, where he obtained his doctorate in 1967.Optima: Fitzwilliam College Newsletter, Issue 21, Summer 2015 (p. 2) Career His subsequent career has been almost entirely at the London School of Economics, where he was appointed a full professor in 1983. In 2005 Bloch was appointed European Professor at the Coll√®ge de France.\\"Maurice Bloch\\" He was until 2009 visiting Professor at the Free University of Amsterdam. He has taught and has been an occasional visiting professor in most European countries, as well as Japan. In the US, he was a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley, at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and at the New School for Social Research in New York City. At present, he is Emeritus Professor at the London School of Economics and an associate member of the Institut Jean Nicod of the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in Paris. He has supervised many younger anthropologists, several of whom hold prestigious posts in the UK, US, Australia, Japan, France, Canada, the Netherlands, China, Argentina, Madagascar and Malaysia. His writings have been translated into at least twelve languages. In 1990, Bloch was elected a Fellow of the British Academy. Research Bloch's field research has been mainly carried out in two different areas of Madagascar. One field site has been among the peasants of central Imerina; and the other in a remote forest inhabited by a group of people called Zafimaniry. His writing deals with religion, kinship, economics, politics and language. His research has been much influenced by French Marxist ideas. He has been an innovator in relating social anthropology to linguistics and cognitive psychology. Much of his theoretical work since the 1970s has concerned the interface between cognition and social and cultural life. What he has written on this subject faces two ways: on the one hand, he criticises anthropologists for exaggerating the particularity of specific cultures; on the other hand, he criticises cognitive scientists for underestimating it. He has published more than a hundred articles and many books, half of which concern Madagascar in some way.

It was designed by Col. James Lewis Glenn in 1863. The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2020. History Ypsilanti had earlier cemeteries, established in the first half of the 19th century. However, by 1850 the city was expanding eastward, and in 1858 Mayor Chauncey Joslin proposed that the city purchase the plot that subsequently became Highland Cemetery. However, this move failed, likely over objections to using tax money to purchase the land. However, in 1863, a group of citizens formed the Highland Cemetery Association for the purpose of establishing a cemetery. They hired James L. Glen to draw up a plan, and in 1864 purchased the land and dedicated Highland Cemetery. By 1880, nearly 550 burial plots had been spoken for. In 1880, the ornamental gate was constructed in the front of the cemetery, and in 1888 a Richardsonian Romanesque chapel was built in the center of the cemetery. In 1901, additional property to the south was added to the cemetery. A short time later the entrance lodge was moved, and fieldstone piers added. A mausoleum was built in 1925. Further portions of the cemetery were platted as needed, and Highland Cemetery remains the primary burial place for the city of Ypsilanti. It is still operated by the Highland Cemetery Association. Description Highland Cemetery covers about 50 acres, with a rolling, sloped topography which includes knolls, valleys, and ravines. A number of structures dating from 1880-1925 are included on the grounds. As designed by Glen, the cemetery features curved paths through stands of trees. The cemetery is the site of the Starkweather Memorial Chapel which was commissioned by Mary Ann Starkweather to honor her husband. The chapel, an example of Richardsonian Romanesque style, was designed by George D. Mason and completed in 1889. There is also a Civil War memorial on the cemetery grounds, which an inscription says was also presented by Mary Ann Starkweather. The entrance to the cemetery is located at 943 N. River St. The cemetery is located in a wooded area of oak, pine, cedar and willow trees. The gates at the cemetery entrance are constructed of decorative wrought iron and measure high and wide. The Highland Cemetery Association, a non-profit cemetery company founded in 1863, owns and operates the cemetery. In 2009, the cemetery began sponsoring an ice cream social after the annual Ypsilanti Memorial Day parade which terminates at the cemetery. Notable persons interred at Highland * Edward P.

Kardynalovska was the daughter of a Russian general of artillery Mykhailo Hryhorovych Kardynalovsky. She also was an older sister of a Ukrainian architect Yelyzaveta Kardynalovska. Tetyana finished one of the Kiev city gymnasiums and studied at the Engineering Department of the Kiev Polytechnic Institute which she did not manage to finish due to the war with Russia. After finishing gymnasium she married Vsevolod Holubovych who at that time was a General Secretary as well as a deputy to the Russian Constituent Assembly. That marriage, however, did not last for long and in 1919 the couple petitioned for divorce. For some time Tetyana continued to live in Kamyanets-Podilsky, working for a local editorship of Chervony Shliakh headed by her former husband, Holubovych. Tetyana later married a former Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary and writer Serhiy Pylypenko who in 1919 joined the ranks of the Bolsheviks and was a Combrig of the Red Army. Pylypenko, like numerous other Ukrainian nationals, was murdered by the Stalinist regime in March 1934, when he was recognized as a counterrevolutionary. After that Tetyana continued to live as a widow of the former enemy of the people in Ukraine until World War II when in 1943 she was deported to Austria for \\"work\\". After escaping from a labor camp she lived in neighboring Italy, then Great Britain. After the war she emigrated to the United States, as returning home was not an option. In the United States she worked as a pedagogue at Harvard University where Kardynalovska taught Russian at first and later the Ukrainian languages. She wrote a collection of her memoirs Nevidstupne mynule (Persistent past). Kardynalovska also was one of the authors of the Russian language textbook \\"Modern Russian\\" (1964/65).

History Born in the late 1970s out of an idea to form a society to further the aims of those with an interest of model engineering. The then \\"Doncaster Model Engineering Society\\" built its track at the rear of the most famous railway place on earth, \\"Doncaster Plant Works\\". Birthplace of Mallard, Flying Scotsman, Green Arrow, Cock of the North to name a few. The group laid 900 feet of ground-level track. Only five years later, they were dismayed to be told after all this hard work had been done that below the top soil, underneath the track bed lies \\"The Works\\" dumping ground of blue asbestos boiler lagging. At the end of the 1984 operating season, and with winter approaching the opportunity arose to consider the next move. Well somebody moved it, the track that is. Only problem was they forgot to tell the group about it, the whole of the track disappeared, removed by a person or persons unknown. The group then met at a local factory, a members home and a country pub until an approach to Thorne Parish Council in 1996, to see if they wanted a miniature railway in their local park, was welcomed by the council. Plans were submitted and the appropriate permission was given. The council offered the use of a very solid brick building a former Second World War air raid shelter, with power and a nearby water supply, a better start could not have been wished for. The building is now the locomotive depot, which was recently adapted by the addition of a steel end door for the rolling stock to gain access to it. The first stage of the venture at Thorne was completed by late July 1998, with a loop of dual ground-level track with a branch line to the preparation area and locomotive shed. In 2000 the Doncaster Model Engineering Society became the Doncaster & District Model Engineering Society Limited. A second loop of track was laid in 2003‚Äì04, with a diamond crossing connecting the two. More recent work to the loco shed has seen the installation of a steel door to enable locomotives and rolling stock to be taken out directly on the track. Installation of fencing at the Thorne Central Station area provides a new central platform. The train service was now becoming a regular feature in the park with good support from the local population and many visitors from other parts of Britain and Overseas. It operates on Sundays from Easter to the end of October,there is no winter running. The service also runs on the annual Thorne Festival weekend. The society has a new web site, www.thornerailway.webs, this is now the official website of the Doncaster & District Model Engineering Society.

Early Years Dawkins was the third of five siblings born in 1957 in Saginaw, Michigan to parents Willie and Ollie Dawkins. Growing up on Saginaw‚Äôs east side, he attended Heavenrich Elementary along with older siblings Willie and Patricia, and younger brother Robert. Paul developed a love for basketball early on at the age of 9, but his only opportunities to play were at the school‚Äôs gym. So he fashioned a rim out of coat hangers, attached a net and hung it inside of the family‚Äôs garage. It was inside the garage where Paul developed his sweet left-handed shooting touch, spending countless hours swishing a volleyball through the makeshift rim. He was unbeatable whether one-on-one or two-on-two, taking on neighborhood friends and brother Robert. Paul parlayed his hoop passion into starting on Heavenrich‚Äôs fourth through sixth grade teams. Next he attended Central Junior High School and starred as a scorer, leading the eighth and ninth grade teams to city championships. Growing to 6‚Äô5, he stood out with the Saginaw High School varsity team in his junior and senior years, earning All-Saginaw Valley League Honors.

As a senior in 1978‚Äì79, he was the Mid- American Conference Player of the Year, and finished 5th in the nation in scoring, at 26.7 points per game. Given the nickname \\"Doctor D\\" by Huskies fans, he earned All-MAC honors three times (First-Team in 1977-79 and honorable mention in 1976-77) and MAC Player of the Week, plus repeat team co- captain and Most Valuable Player (1977-79). Paul was named on the All-Time Chick Evans Field House team in 1997, and NIU's All-Century team in 2000-01. He finished with at least seven school records, including season points (695), career points (1,749), season field goals (291), career field goals (751), and season scoring average (26.7). Professional career Following his collegiate career, Dawkins was drafted in the 10th round, of the 1979 NBA Draft, by the Utah Jazz. Dawkins appeared in 57 NBA games, while averaging 13.6 minutes and 5.5 points per game. He scored 30 points in one half, during a game against the Portland Trail Blazers, making 13 of 15 shots from the field.Northern Illinois All-Century Cager Paul \`Doctor D' Dawkins Honored In Hometown .

Founded in 2010, the CRL organizes the Canada national rugby league team and supports the development of the game through the country's domestic competitions. History Canada Rugby League was formed in February 2010, by Eric Perez, \\"with a vision to bring rugby league to the people of Canada\\". The organisation was founded to redevelop organised rugby league in Canada, which had been dormant since the Canadian Rugby League Federation folded in 2000. The CRL reestablished the Canada national rugby league team to participate in international competition and set up a domestic league from which national team players would be drawn. The team played its first competitive game in ten years at the 2010 \\"War at the Shore\\" tournament, hosted by the American National Rugby League (AMNRL) in New Jersey. In September 2010 CRL hosted its first international game in Canada, with Canada facing the United States in the Colonial Cup. Later that year they competed in the Rugby League Atlantic Cup in Jacksonville, Florida. Canada won its first international match since 2000 on 31 July 2011 defeating Jamaica 40-10 in Markham, Ontario. In 2017, Toronto Wolfpack to begin play in the third tier of the British rugby league system.http://www.loverugbyleague.com/news_21086-off- the-record-rugby-league-transfer-gossip-25.html They achieved promotion to the second tier in their first attempt.

In July 2010, St. Catharines Bobcats, based in St. Catharines in Ontario's Niagara Region, were announced as the league's first domestic team. In September 2010 the Bobcats were joined by a second team, the Toronto City Saints.http://www.saintsrlfc.com/news/2797 The Saints formed a relationship with the St Helens R.F.C. of the Super League. The Bobcats and Saints played two games against each other, with players for the national squad being drawn from the two teams.http://www.rleague.com/db/article.php?id=37892 Toronto won both games.http://www.rugbyleagueinternationalscores.com/index.php/2010/10/no- rest-for-the-best/ In 2011, the CRL announced the domestic competition would expand to four teams in Ontario. St. Catharines Bobcats changed their name to the Niagara Bobcats, while two new clubs from the Toronto area were announced. The two new clubs are the York Region Reds, based in Ontario's York Region, and the Scarborough Centurions, based in Toronto's Scarborough area. York Region has a team partnership with Salford of the Super League, while Scarborough has a partnership with Leigh, who play in the Co-operative Championship. In 2012, British Columbia commenced a new domestic competition which had 5 teams under the British Columbia Rugby League Competition (BCRL) banner. By the end of 2012, BC had become the premier competition within Canada. In 2013, BCRL expanded to 6 teams namely Bayside Sharks, Kelowna Crows, Richmond Bears, Sea to Sky Eagles, Surrey Beavers and Vancouver Dragons. Logo The Canada Rugby League logo, used since 2010, incorporates symbols and imagery of Canada and rugby league football. The CRL designed the logo to be \\"unique compared to other Canadian sports logos, yet instantly recognisable to the League community\\". The CRL gives this description of the logo: \\"Blended with the core rugby league imagery of the ball and twin vee, the CRL logo has been designed to incorporate some very Canadian imagery including an outline of the entire country, and naturally the maple leaf. The colours of red, black and white are also synonymous with the country, and will be prominent on the Canadian national team.\\" In 2015, after a whole new board was put in place, the logo was updated for the 2017 World Cup Qualifiers against Jamaica and the USA, with new sponsors IMPACT Prowear providing the kit. IMPACT Prowear then designed an entire off field range, which was released in collaboration with the CRL for these qualifiers. International rugby league Rugby league's capacity to draw crowds has surprised since the sport's re-establishment in 2010. The national side regularly draws crowds exceeding 5,000 to international matches, with some attendances over 7,000. In comparison, Canadian rugby union, which has been established for many years longer, has only drawn a handful of international attendances over 10,000 since the formalization of the sport's split from Canadian football.

Biography Kiki studied humanities and social sciences before turning towards drawing and painting. In Montparnasse, he was introduced by the actor Michel Simon to Henry Miller who advised him to devote himself to photography. He then worked with the ethnologist Robert Jaulin and traveled through Asia, Central Europe, Cuba, Jamaica, and the United States. In the early 1990s he joined the humanistic photography movement, associating with Willy Ronis. Kiki of Paris built his artistic image around themes that were important to him, such as everyday life in the Italian summer. The Kiki of Paris Committee was founded in 2006 with the sole aim of promoting the artist‚Äôs work and to provide certificates of authenticity for his work. Kiki of Paris has been a member of ADAGP.1 since 1999. Kiki of Paris‚Äôs melancholy The photograph Key West depicts the yellow taxi that Kiki of Paris had just ridden into Miami. The shot is defined by its inherent strangeness, particularly the sense of loneliness and isolation we feel through the photographer‚Äôs gaze. Although taken in a busy city, the taxi driving off into the heat certainly fills the viewer with the sense of loss and abandonment experienced by the photographer. Kiki of Paris' work is defined by his ability to capture the abstract in everyday situations and settings. For example, The Last Ride depicts a fairground ride making its last run of the day. While this alone is nothing striking, the photographer perfectly captures the sense of time slipping away through the positioning of his subjects, both the rider operator and its passengers. This photograph is noteworthy for its use of a contemporary style and reliance on popular culture, although it‚Äôs truly made by the sense of romance it manages to find in this seemingly normal situation. One of the most striking things about Kiki of Paris‚Äô career is his small portfolio. This is because he destroys much of his work, or manages to lose the images, whether deliberately or not. Polymorphous Structures Along with creating new images, Kiki of Paris also reworks existing pictures in a series he calls Polymorphous Structures. His intention with this series is to find new meaning in what exists, along with provoking thought among his viewers. He uses these images to create an allegory, such as Ulysses or Sacrifice of the Cockerel. Desolation Canyon is a perfect example of this thought process in action. In the image, the photographer uses a group of people he photographed in Charleroi and transposes them onto an American Landscape, specifically Death Valley. All of Kiki of Paris' works capture his sense of subjectivity, along with his appreciation of the ordinary in everyday life and the way he views the world. Some notable examples of this include Loulou the dog, which only uses pedestrian crossings, or the coy smile of a member of the Prague majorettes. He manages to capture the innate intimacy between people and the world around them, simply with the purpose of showing how we interact with our surroundings. Adios Queen (Manhattan - New-York) 1988 Sense and imagination Kiki of Paris' work bears many similarities to popular artists such as David LaChappelle or Nan Goldin, but it also stands out in its own right. Importantly, Kiki of Paris manages to find the unusual even in the most normal circumstances. This is the cornerstone of his humanistic approach to photography, as shown in the image Key West. Kiki of Paris claims this image reminds him of the book Visions of Cody by Jack Kerouac: ‚ÄúYou know that strange feeling when the taxi leaves and you feel lonely in the world, like an orphan?‚Äù Among the many of Kiki of Paris 's influences, it is worth noting some of the very brief encounters that guided her choices and her destiny: Henry Miller of course, but also the American director Joseph Losey and the survivors of the beat generation who passed through Paris. Notably among them was Burroughs, who, according to Kiki of Paris, had such a disturbing look on his face. \\"What makes the image is culture, photography is a piece of encapsulated time, and the result is a composite chemistry. Add to that the \\"right moment, the T moment, the meeting between the idea, the concept, the aesthetic and a well-framed subject\\".

She was the first Asian-American to be ordained as a rabbi, and the first Asian-American to be ordained as a hazzan (cantor) anywhere in the world.

Early life  Buchdahl was born in Seoul, South Korea, to a Japanese-born Korean Buddhist mother, Sulja Yi Warnick, and Frederick David Warnick, an American Ashkenazi Reform Jew, whose ancestors emigrated from Moine»ôti, Romania, and Russia to the United States.Buchdahl, Angela Warnick, \\"My Personal Story: Kimchee on the Seder Plate\\", Sh'ma: A Journal of Jewish Responsibility, Published June 2003. Reprinted March 28, 2012. At the age of five, she moved to the United States with her family. She was raised Jewish, attending Temple Beth El in Tacoma, Washington, which her great-grandparents had assisted in founding a century before. Like her mother, she became very involved in temple activities, and became a leader in school and within the youth group. At the age of 16, she visited Israel through Bronfman youth fellowships with other Jewish teenagers from the U.S. and for the first time had the authenticity of her Judaism questioned by those who believe that only the children of a Jewish mother can be Jewish. Her Orthodox roommate told Buchdahl she did not consider her to be Jewish, and Israelis asked if she knew the meaning of the Star of David on her necklace. She notes that her experience in Israel was a painful one, where she felt marginalized and invisible. As a college student, she spent her summers working as head song leader at Camp Swig, a Reform Jewish camp in Saratoga, California. At the age of 21 she underwent a conversion or \\"giyur\\", which she views as a \\"reaffirmation ceremony\\". Buchdahl attended Yale University, where she was one of the first female members of Skull and Bones, a secret society which counts former President George W. Bush and United States Secretary of State John Kerry as members.Women rabbis who waded into a sea of opposition still fighting the waves article in Times of Israel, 8 December 2016. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Religious Studies from Yale University in 1994, and began her cantorial and rabbinic studies at Hebrew Union College. Career In 1999 she was invested as a cantor and then ordained as a rabbi in 2001 by HUC-JIR, an American seminary for Reform Judaism. She became assistant rabbi and cantor at Westchester Reform Temple, which in 2003 had membership of over 1,200 families. She appears in the PBS documentary 18 Voices Sing Kol Nidre. She joined Central Synagogue, a large Reform congregation in Manhattan, as senior cantor in 2006. During her tenure as of 2012, Friday night attendance at the synagogue had doubled, post-bar mitzvah retention had tripled and the waiting list for membership had risen to over 300. In 2013, she was named as the Senior Rabbi of the Central Synagogue. She is the first woman and the first Asian-American to be their Senior Rabbi. She has served as faculty for the Wexner Heritage Foundation and for the Union for Reform Judaism (URJ) Kallot programs, and on the board of Auburn Theological Seminary, Avodah Jewish Service Corps, UJA Federation, and the Jewish Multiracial Network. On July 1, 2014, Angela Buchdahl succeeded Peter Rubinstein as Senior Rabbi at Central Synagogue, the first woman and first Asian-American to hold the post in the Synagogue's long history, and one of only a few women serving as leaders of a major U.S. synagogue.

In December 2014 she was welcomed by President Barack Obama to lead the prayers at the White House Hanukkah celebration. At the podium, she commented on how special the scene was, asking the President if he believed America's founding fathers could possibly have pictured that a female Asian-American rabbi would one day be at the White House leading Jewish prayers in front of the African-American president. Her speech on the meaning of Hannukah and religious freedom met with applause and cheers. Writer Abigail Pogrebin, who also served as President of Central Synagogue (where Buchdahl is Senior Rabbi), noted that as Buchdahl \\"stood alongside the African-American president and led us in the Hebrew blessing over the candles, there was a moving magnificence both in that unlikely tableau and in the sound of a Jewish prayer filling The People's house\\".

(1892) is a fungal genus within the phylum Basidiomycota, Class Puccinomycetes, Order Septobasidales, Family Septobasidiaceae. Approximately 175 described species are associated with this genus. Septobasidium species are known as Entomopathogens. Description Septobasidium spp. are characterized by their presence on the underside of branches and leaves of deciduous trees, shrubs and in a symbiotic association with scale insects (Coccoidea). Fruiting bodies form a crust (resupinate) and range in color and size, from small patches (1 mm in diameter) to 2 meters wide. Species of this genus are often distinguished based on the thickness of the fruiting body. Some species form elaborate chambers and tunnels that house scale insects with top and bottom layers while others form a very thin hyphal network. Microscopic characteristics, such as the number of basidiospores produced on a basidia, presence of pillars supporting the top layer (if applicable), number of cells in a basidia, and shape of haustoria (infectious cells) that form within the scale insects are used to distinguish species. Septobasidium is unique in that it is one of a few genera within the family Septobasidaceae that exists in symbiotic relationships with scale insects ranging from obligately parasitic to mutualistic. This type of fungus is fairly unique for having a mutualistic relationship with scale insect hosts, rather than killing them. Although it weakens the insects it parasitizes, it does not kill them and it benefits the population as a whole, helping provide protection from parasitoid wasps by forming a mycelial mat that helps conceal the insects. The fungus benefits from the relationship, as it is nourished by the waste products the insects produce.  Symbiotic association with insects  Couch proposed in 1938 that the symbiotic relationship between Septobasidium and scale insects was mutualistic. He suggested that at a population level, scale insects benefit from certain species of Septobasidium that provide protection from predators, and prevent desiccation. Couch also remarked that some scale insects remain uninfected while others are infected and rendered sterile. Some Septobasidium species provide no discernable shelter and parasitize all scale insects associated with the fruiting body. This suggests that the symbiotic relationships within this genus are complex, and merit further investigation. Additionally, no clear benefit has been demonstrated for scale insects associated with the fungus compared to free- living scale insects. The scale insect itself is a parasite of the host tree or shrub, resulting in a tri-partite symbiosis between the fungus, insect, and tree. The fungus itself does not parasitize the tree tissue and the scale insects do not need the fungus to survive. During the spring months, basidia gives rise to sexual spores known as basidiospores that are capable of infecting a first instar scale insect walking across the surface of the fruiting body. The infected insect will either 1) settle with other scale insects within the same fruiting body it was infected by, 2) travel to another fruiting body and settle, or 3) move to an un-infected plant tissue and settle, forming a new colony of the fruiting body. Scale insects are mobile during the first instar after hatching, which co-occurs in the spring when basidiospores are released. Scale insects begin to feed on plant sap and settle into one location, eventually molting and shedding legs. Hyphae emerge from natural openings of infected insects and form a mycelial mat above the infected and non-infected insects. The lifecycle completes itself when hyphae gives rise to new basidiospores on the surface of the mycelial mat during spring rain events, and infects the next generation of scale insects.

Early life Gay was born in Lantenay, Ain in 1790, the son of a public notary. He served in the First Empire's military and became a carpenter by trade, settling in Lyon. A very religious man, he desired to become a monk even during his youth. At the age of 46, he applied for entry into the Abbey of La Trappe d'Aiguebelle, and was accepted as a lay brother. He subsequently left the monastery due to a nervous disorder, which some claimed to be demon possession. Allegations of demon possession Friar Burnoud, a former superior of the Missionaries of La Salette, wrote a letter to the then-Bishop of Grenoble in which he wrote that \\"We have examined Master Gay of Lyons three times, each session lasting from one to two hours. We consider it very probable that this man is possessed by a devil\\", citing various pieces of evidence including Gay disclosing \\"several secret things about which he had no means of knowing\\" and his apparent ability to understand Latin despite never having learned the language. A physician, one Dr. Pictet, expressed the view that Gay enjoyed \\"perfect health of body and mind\\" but was also \\"under the influence of some occult power, which we are naturally unable to detect by medical means\\" and that \\"we remain convinced that his extraordinary state can only be attributed to possession\\", citing as evidence \\"the fact that during our first interview with M. Gay, that extraordinary thing which speaks through his mouth revealed the inmost secrets of our heart, told us the story of our life from the age of twelve onwards, giving details that are known only to God, our confessor, and ourselves.\\" Following Pictet's observations, Gay's friends tried to have him readmitted to the Abbey of La Trappe, asking the abbot to perform an exorcism. The abbot refused because he was in the diocese of Valence, while Gay was from the diocese of Lyons. Antoine Gay lived in Lyons for the next few years, at one point being arrested as a lunatic and jailed for three months before being released. Fr. Chiron Friar Marie-Joseph Chiron, who had founded a community that looked after the mentally disturbed, took an interest in Antoine Gay, believing him to be possessed. One day, Chiron brought Gay with him to the house of a woman nicknamed Chiquette, who was also allegedly possessed by a demon that Chiron referred to as \\"Madeste\\". Fr. Chiron claimed that when Gay met Chiquette, their demons began to argue with each other: \\"A remarkably violent dialogue arose between the two fallen angels. The two devils sounded like mad dogs. They spoke a totally unknown language, very softly and we understood nothing. I was later informed by Isacaron, who translated the dispute for me, that it was on a question of precedence, as to which was the greater of the two....the two possessed, it is needless to say, had never met each other, but the devils in possession knew each other well. Six times during the following days there occurred the same violent disputes, in the same unknown language, and in the presence of several witnesses.\\" Friar Chiron claimed afterward that \\"Such facts are inexplicable except as cases of possession.\\" No exorcism was ever performed for Antoine Gay, and he died in June 1871 in Lyons.

DeRosa competed professionally in Naples, Italy until a knee injury ended his playing days. Before settling in the United States in 1967, he had previously coached the Italian Army team and also served as an assistant for Italy's Olympic squad.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&dat;=19711216&id;=07slAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=R_MFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=4257,2148965 Once in America, he served as coach, general manager and owner of the Syracuse Scorpions of the American Soccer League. In 1969, he guided the Scorpions to a tie at the top of the Northern Division and won a one match playoff for the division crown over Rochester, before losing to the Washington Darts in the ASL finals. He took over as coach the Lancers (who had since moved to the NASL) midway through the 1970 season, bringing five of the Scorpions‚Äô top players along with him, including midfielder Frank Odoi and goalie Claude Campos. Over the final thirteen games of the season, he guided the Lancers to a mark of 6-4-3 and into the NASL title series, defeating those same Washington Darts (who had also jumped leagues) by a 2 match aggregate of 4-3. He also won the 1970 NASL Coach of the Year award.http://www.nasl.com/article/uuid/x2teee3hefe51t667thdnfocy/former-nasl- championship-coach-sal-derosa-passes-away#.UxocZoWAfbg In 1971 the Lancers won the NASL regular season title under him, but lost in a grueling semi-final serieshttp://www.ussoccerplayers.com/2011/09/back-in-the-day-the-nasls- longest-game.html to eventual champion Dallas. That year the Lancers also were awarded the NASL Governor's Cup, given to the squad with best record against foreign teams. This was in large part due to their 4th place finish in the 1971 CONCACAF Champions' Cup, where they finished 4-1-2 (and +4 on goal dif) in all matches. DeRosa went on to coach the Miami Gatos (formerly the Washington Darts) in 1972, before returning to Rochester to coach the Lancers for one more season. Several years later, Sal also served as vice-president and general manager of the Buffalo Stallions of the Major Indoor Soccer League and as their coach from 1979-1980.http://blogs.buffalonews.com/sports_ink/2011/12/this-day-in-buffalo- sports-history-a-new-coach-in-town.html He founded the Buffalo Storm of the United Soccer League in 1984 and has served as special consultant and president of the citizens advisory committee for the Buffalo Blizzard of the NPSL in the 1990s.

Plot After failing one of her midterm exams in a Madrid high school, Paz Velasco decides to drop out of the academic circuit. She takes this prompt decision much to the chagrin of her father, an overbearing taxi driver. In exchange, he forces her to join him at work so she can learn the trade and earn a living. Her reconnection with the so-called \\"Family\\", the close-knit group of her father's co-workers, is initially uneventful. One of its members is Dani, Paz's childhood sweetheart and a young taxi apprentice about to be discharged from the military service. Upon meeting for the first time in many years, they rekindle their mutual attraction and start dating, much to the apparent satisfaction of Dani's mother Reme‚Äîa fellow cabbie who is having a secret affair with Paz's father. Reme's husband is a former taxi driver who, according to the explanations given to Paz, was shot by two drug dealers during a robbery. One of the shots left him paralyzed and the \\"Family\\"'s visits to him in the hospital are a staple in their common social life. Aside from Dani, Velasco and Reme, this group is completed by a shady individual named Calero and a thuggish brute nicknamed \\"Ni√±o\\" who seems to act as an informal henchman of sorts for the former. Paz realizes Calero is a former cop even before being told so, and their mutual distrust is vivid and ever-increasing throughout the film. From the outset, it is made clear to the audience that the \\"Family\\" is in fact a neo-fascist death squad whose members use their cabs to abduct non-white, immigrant, LGTB and drug-addicted customers with murderous intent. There is also some evidence of rudimentary tactics, e.g. using code words for each \\"kind\\" of victim in order to lure unwitting victims to the killing box. Dani has been recently groomed into the group and partakes in their activities, although it is made apparent to the audience that he does so reluctantly. The \\"Family\\" seems to be generally successful in its exploits: two murders are shown on-screen, as well as a raid on a Moroccan camp during which Dani accidentally kills a man. The film does show, however, one botched attack during which the victim manages to run away unharmed. It is left unclear whether or not the group is restricted to the core members shown onscreen. It is also left unclear whether the group's activities were prompted by the attack that crippled Dani's father or it was just a casual event that fuelled them further, or whether the version given to Paz was a lie and the attack was a direct result of the group's illegal pursuits. Their activities are spontaneous and seemingly not officially sanctioned, but there are ominous references by Calero to people \\"up there\\" who know and approve of the group's activities, leaving the door open to speculation on a wider conspiracy. Although initially ignorant of the actions and general demeanour of the \\"Family\\", Paz gradually finds out the truth through a series of details and coincidences, such as a profusion of fascist and pre-democratic antics and regalia, purportedly intimate family reunions attracting skinheads and other sinister individuals and ending in massive Roman salutes, casual bigoted remarks from her father and Dani (as well as the latter's violent outburst on a black street vendor) and a disturbing pattern of codenames or \\"labels\\" directed at different collectivities. Paz's unassuming and long-suffering mother seems increasingly distraught at the prospect of having Dani close to her daughter, and although Paz initially blames this on his general lack of education and ambition, it becomes increasingly clear that her mother knows more than she says about him and the whole group. Once confronted with the evidence, her disgust and adamant disapproval set up a chain of events leading to the climax. The paranoid and increasingly unstable Calero, who saw her as a potential liability to the group from the very beginning, now wishes to silence Paz at all costs. He shoots (and presumably kills) her father when he tries to stop him, and confronts her and Dani in the Retiro Park, shooting Dani, and being shot to death by Paz seconds before he is about to finish him off. The camera pans over the park as she walks away with the injured Dani, and credits roll. The fate of the rest of the group is left undisclosed.
