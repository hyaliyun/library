Davies was born in Llangennech, Carmarthenshire, Wales, the son of Rhys and Ann Davies. After an elementary education he initially worked as a farm labourer. He subsequently moved to the Rhondda Valley, where he worked as a coalminer for ten years. From an early age he was involved in the local co-operative society and became a union official organising shop-assistants throughout South Wales. This led to his moving to Manchester, to take up a post with the Amalgamated Union of Co- operative Employees and later the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers.'Obituary: Mr R J Davies', The Times, 2 November 1954. He was a member of Manchester City Council for thirty years, and also president of the Manchester and Salford Trades Council and of the Withington Divisional Parliamentary Labour Party. In 1921, William Wilson, Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for Westhoughton, died, and Davies was elected at a by- election to succeed him. He served in the first Labour Government in 1924 as Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department. This was the only government office he held. He retained the Westhoughton seat through successive elections until he retired from the House of Commons early in 1951 due to ill health.'MP not to seek re-election', The Times, 10 April 1951, p. 7. At the time he was the longest-serving Labour MP. Davies was a strong supporter of the temperance and pacifist movements, whose causes he advocated in Parliament and in the country. He was also a committed parliamentarian, and served as joint secretary of the British group of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. He married Margaret Griffiths in 1902, and they had three sons. Davies died at his home in Porthcawl, Glamorgan, in 1954, aged 77.

Early life Flora Payne Whitney was born on July 27, 1897 and raised in Manhattan. Her father was Harry Payne Whitney (1872‚Äì1930), a sportsman and heir to the Whitney family fortune, and her mother was Gertrude Vanderbilt (1875‚Äì1942), heiress to a substantial part of the Vanderbilt family fortune. She attended Brearley School in New York and Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Virginia, where she met and became close lifelong friends with the artist Kay Sage. Career During World War I, she worked with Ruth Hanna McCormick, wife of Senator Joseph M. McCormick, at the Washington headquarters of the Republican Women's National Executive Committee. Whitney worked closely with her mother, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney in the founding and endowing of the Whitney Museum of Art in New York. After her mother's death, Whitney served as President of the Museum from 1941 until 1966, and as Chairman from 1966 through 1974. Whitney's daughter and granddaughter remain active in museum affairs to this day. Personal life On August 4, 1916, Whitney made her debut at \\"The Reefs,\\" the Payne-Whitney \\"cottage\\" in Newport, Rhode Island. She was escorted by Quentin Roosevelt, son of President Theodore Roosevelt, although her father did not approve of young Roosevelt. After the United States entered World War I, Quentin enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Service, and became engaged to Whitney before leaving for duty overseas. The glamorous young couple never married, since Quentin was killed in aerial combat in July, 1918. Love letters exchanged between Flora and Quentin while he was at the front were featured in Edward Renehan's book about TR's sons, The Lion's Pride (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998). In 1920, Whitney married Roderick Tower at St. Bartholomew's Church, New York. He was an aviator who had trained with Quentin Roosevelt at Mineola air field on Long Island. Tower was also a stockbroker, and son of U.S. Ambassador to Russia and Germany Charlemagne Tower, Jr. The marriage was a failure, however, due to Tower's drinking and infidelity. Before their divorce in August 1925, they had two children together: *Pamela Tower (b. 1921), who married Jay Ketchum Secor (1912‚Äì1960) in 1941. They divorced in 1950 and she later married Thomas LeBoutillier (1913‚Äì1979) *Whitney Tower (1923‚Äì1999) In 1927, Whitney married George Macculloch Miller III (d. 1972) in Cairo, Egypt. Miller was an artist and member of the architectural firm of Noel & Miller, from 1930 to 1948, and a grandson of George Macculloch Miller (1832‚Äì1917), the founder what would become the United Hospital Fund. The marriage to \\"Cully\\" Miller was long and happy, and Whitney had two more children: *Flora Miller (b. 1928), who married Michael Henry Irving She later married Sydney Francis Biddle (1918‚Äì2004) *Leverett Saltonstall Miller (b. 1931) She died on July 18, 1986 at Community Hospital in Glen Cove, L.I. =Descendants= Whitney's grandson John LeBoutillier is a political columnist and commentator and a one-term U.S. Representative representing a Long Island district.

The term is often used to refer simply to contracting out services, which takes place extensively in many countries today; for instance, in the form of various prison services provided piecemeal by private vendors. Taken to its fullest extreme, however, privatization entails private-sector control over all the decisions regarding the use of resources devoted to the protection of persons and property. Many criminal justice services are privatized because the government lacks the means to carry them out. For example, private bail bondsmen help enforce the laws requiring those released on bail to appear for trial. If the defendant disappears, the bondsman may hire a bounty hunter to find them and bring them back. The bondsman also has a monetary incentive to make an accurate assessment as to the defendant's likelihood of jumping bail; if he declines to grant a bond to an individual who would have shown up to trial, then he loses business, but if he grants bail to a person who jumps bail, then he suffers a financial loss. The government does not have such incentives built into its decisionmaking mechanisms for pretrial release. In the mid-1960s, Florida Governor Claude Kirk commissioned Wackenhut Services for a $500,000 \\"war on organized crime\\" contract that led to more than 80 criminal indictments, including many local politicians and government employees. Multi-State, a firm established by a former Columbus, Ohio police chief and employed thirteen former police officers with narcotics experience in 1973 \\"rented\\" skilled narcotics agents to small-town police forces in Ohio and West Virginia; more than 150 arrests and seizures of $200,000 in drugs took place. In 1993, the Kentwood, Michigan police department signed a three-year contract with a private firm to investigate and recover bad checks. The contractor handles all merchant contacts, telephone calls regarding bad checks, and investigations, in an effort to recover the face value of the check as well as the expenses for both the merchant and the police department. According to Wyoming Detective James Maguffee, \\"\\"They've got a great track record...It's just been a phenomenal success.\\"Rise in check fraud leads to new investigative team - Advance Newspapers - MLive.com In Switzerland, Securitas provides police services for more than 30 Swiss villages and townships. Paradise Island also has a private police force. In 1975, Oro Valley, Arizona contracted for police services with Rural/Metro Fire Department but the arrangement was challenged by the Arizona Law Enforcement Officers Advisory Council. Rural/Metro could not pay the legal fees needed to fight the challenge and the arrangement was ended in 1977. In some cases, private police are deputized in order to ensure compliance with the law, but continue to be paid by the hour so that money can be saved by releasing them during slow times; as when Kalamazoo, Michigan contracted for street patrol and traffic control with Charles Services. Other jurisdictions that have had contracts for police services with private firms include Indian Springs, Florida, Buffalo Creek, West Virginia (which was served by Guardsmark) and Reminderville, Ohio which contracted with Corporate Security in 1981; as well as Sussex, New Jersey, which contracted for police services with Executive Security and Investigations Services after the town's entire four-officer police force was dismissed in 1993 because of a drug scandal. In the United States, policy manuals for policing are written by Lexipol, a private company, which are then implemented by thousands of law enforcement agencies, particularly small and medium-sized departments.

Its fossils are known from the Late Cretaceous deposits in Inner Mongolia, China. Wu et al. (1993), Wu et al. (1996) and Gao (1997) proposed and argued that it was the oldest known amphisbaenian; this, however, was challenged by other authors, such as Kearney (2003) and Conrad (2008), who instead assigned Sineoamphisbaena to the group of squamates variously known as Macrocephalosauridae, Polyglyphanodontidae or Polyglyphanodontia. A large- scale study of fossil and living squamates published in 2012 by Gauthier et al. did not find evidence for a particularly close relationship between amphisbaenians and Sineoamphisbaena; in their primary analysis Sineoamphisbaena was found to be the sister taxon of the clade containing snakes, amphisbaenians, the family Dibamidae and the American legless lizard. The primary analysis of Gauthier et al. did not support a close relationship between Sineoamphisbaena and polyglyphanodontians either; however, the authors noted that when all snake-like squamates and mosasaurs were removed from the analysis, and burrowing squamates were then added individually to it, Sineoamphisbaena grouped with polyglyphanodontians. Gauthier et al. (2012) considered it possible that Sineoamphisbaena was a burrowing polyglyphanodontian.

The film was directed by Paul Bogart and stars Fierstein as Arnold, Anne Bancroft as Ma Beckoff, Matthew Broderick as Alan, Brian Kerwin as Ed, and Eddie Castrodad as David. Executive Producer Ronald K. Fierstein is Harvey Fierstein's brother. Wanting to highlight the work of female impersonator Charles Pierce, Fierstein created the role of Bertha Venation specifically for him. Broderick originally refused the role of Alan because he was recuperating from an automobile accident in Ireland. Tate Donovan was cast, but two days into the rehearsal period Broderick had a change of heart and contacted Fierstein, who fired Donovan. Although the play was over four hours, the film was restricted to a running time of two hours at the insistence of New Line Cinema, necessitating much editing and excisions. The time frame was regressed to begin several years earlier than when the play was set. Plot * 1971: Arnold (Harvey Fierstein), a New York City female impersonator, meets Ed (Brian Kerwin), a bisexual schoolteacher, and they fall in love. Ed, however, is uncomfortable with his sexuality and he leaves Arnold for a girlfriend, Laurel. * 1973-79: During Christmas, Arnold meets the love of his life, a male model named Alan (Matthew Broderick). They settle down together, later spending a weekend with Ed and Laurel in the country, where their relationship is tested but endures. Eventually, they apply to foster a child together with a view to adoption, and their application is eventually successful and so they move to a bigger apartment. However, on their first night at their new home, Alan is killed in a homophobic attack. * 1980: Months later, in the spring of 1980, Arnold's mother (Anne Bancroft) comes to visit from Florida, but her visit leads to a long-overdue confrontation. Arnold's mother disapproves of Arnold's homosexuality and his planned adoption of a gay teenage son, David (Eddie Castrodad), as well as Arnold's use of their family burial plot for Alan. They have a series of arguments where Arnold demands that she accept him for who he is, insisting that if she can't then she has no place in his life. The following morning, before she returns to Florida, they have a conversation where, for the first time, they seem to understand each other. With both David and Ed (who is now more mature and settled) in his life, and a successful new career creating his own stage revue, Arnold's life is finally complete.

The album charted on the jazz charts of industry magazines Billboard and Cashbox. The song \\"This Time the Dream's On Me\\" sung by Ella Fitzgerald, which is used several times throughout the film including over the closing credits, was excised from the planned soundtrack album by Norman Granz, Fitzgerald's long-time manager, when he invoked a contractual clause which gave Fitzgerald the right to refuse her material to appear on an album featuring another artist (known in the music industry as a \\"coupling clause\\"). In actuality, Granz was unhappy with the money offered by the record company, PolyGram Records (now part of Universal Music), for the use of the song in the film and refused permission for its inclusion on the album out of spite. Original music by Peter Matz and contemporary pop tunes such as Rod Stewart's \\"Maggie May\\" were used in the film, but not contained on the soundtrack as its producers, Larry L. Lash and Matz, felt they broke the overall \\"torch song\\" theme of the album. The track listing is as follows: # \\"'S Wonderful\\" ‚Äì Count Basie Orchestra, Joe Williams # \\"Dames\\" ‚Äì Harvey Fierstein, Nick Montgomery, Robert Neary, Ken Page, Charles Pierce, Axel Vera # \\"But Not for Me\\" ‚Äì Billie Holiday # \\"Body and Soul\\" ‚Äì Charlie Haden Quartet West # \\"Svelte\\" ‚Äì Harvey Fierstein # \\"Skylark\\" ‚Äì Marilyn Scott # \\"I Loves You, Porgy\\" ‚Äì Bill Evans # \\"Can't We Be Friends?\\" ‚Äì Anita O'Day # \\"Love for Sale\\" ‚Äì Harvey Fierstein # \\"What's New?\\" ‚Äì Billie Holiday Home media Torch Song Trilogy was released on VHS in 1989, and on DVD in May 2004. The DVD version contains an audio commentary track by actor and writer Harvey Fierstein. Reception Torch Song Trilogy was generally well received by critics, with reviews from Variety, Time Out, Roger Ebert and Janet Maslin all praising the film. It holds a 71% score on Rotten Tomatoes based on 17 reviews. Janet Maslin from The New York Times wrote ‚ÄúLike La Cage aux Folles, Torch Song Trilogy presents a homosexual world that any mother, with the possible exception of Arnold Beckoff‚Äôs, would love. Greatly shortened from Mr. Fierstein‚Äôs long-running, Tony Award-winning play, the film version emphasizes the lovable at every turn, but the surprise is that it does this entertainingly and well.‚Äù Roger Ebert commented ‚ÄúAs written and performed by Harvey Fierstein as a long-running stage hit, it was seen as a sort of nostalgic visit to the problems that gays had in the years before the horror of AIDS. The movie has more or less the same focus, but because it‚Äôs a movie, it becomes more intimate and intense.‚Äù Awards and nominations At the 1989 Deauville Film Festival, director Paul Bogart was nominated for the Critics Award and won the Audience Award. The film was also nominated for Best Feature and Fierstein was nominated for Best Male Lead at the Independent Spirit Awards that same year.

His latest works include conceptual self-portraits in drag reminiscent of the works of Cindy Sherman. Easton lives and works in Los Angeles. In addition to creating fine art, he teaches workshops in mosaic and pastel technique. In 2006, he wrote and directed the performance art piece ‚ÄúThe Staggering Libido Sisters Sing Songs of Love‚Ä¶ and Revenge‚Äù which is rescheduled for production in 2009. Early years Easton was born on January 19, 1959 in Lakehurst, New Jersey, USA. Shortly after his birth his family moved to Dayton, Ohio. Although Easton became interested in the visual arts as early as elementary school, his interest in theatre arts led him to Wright State University and Arizona State University where he studied acting and stage design. Upon graduating he relocated to Los Angeles, California, where he worked in the television and movie industries and in interior design. Easton continued his education by attending classes and workshops in art and art history at Santa Monica College, Cal State Northridge, Otis-Parsons, and Art Center in Pasadena, where he focused on his drafting skills and use of color. In 1994, he wrote the screenplay for the movie Dressed to Thrill, which was developed by Fineline Features. Overwhelmed by the ‚Äúrampant egos‚Äù and what he coined the ‚Äúplastic flash-and-cash‚Äù of Hollywood culture, Easton left that business in order to focus fully on visual and conceptual art. But the entertainment industry and celebrity culture became the major subject matter of his ensuing works. Artistic career Easton‚Äôs earliest works included his popular mosaics which utilize classical techniques and materials yet address contemporary art tastes. His ongoing work in pastel and acrylic is ‚Äúall about play‚Ä¶ enjoying the sensuality of my materials in relation to the subject matter.‚Äù In 2007 he began creating contemporary pop art pieces in self-portraits as an alter ego by the name of Aida Libido, ‚Äúnamed by Time Magazine the most beloved and influential pop culture personality‚Ä¶ ever.‚Äù While Easton insists that Aida Libido is not an alter ego but in fact simply ‚Äúis,‚Äù bemused critics point to an uncanny similarity of physical features and the fact that Libido‚Äôs situational comedy relates closely to the celebrity culture Easton came to detest at the end of his Hollywood years. Either way, Aida Libido has taken on a life and career of her own, ‚Äòstarring‚Äô in ‚ÄúThe Staggering Libido Sisters Sing Songs of Love‚Ä¶ and Revenge,‚Äù and appearing frequently as Easton‚Äôs subject and muse in his latest gallery exhibitions, greeting card lines, and assorted kitsch.

A subdistrict of the Lakeview District Area, its boundaries as defined by the City Planning Commission are: Lake Pontchartrain to the north, Bayou St. John to the east, Robert E. Lee Boulevard to the south and Pontchartrain Boulevard and the New Basin Canal to the west. The neighborhood is composed of the Lakeshore and Lake Vista subdivisions, built on land reclaimed from Lake Pontchartrain. The Lakefront is a term sometimes used to name the larger neighborhood created by the Orleans Levee Board's land reclamation initiative in early 20th century New Orleans; it includes Lakeshore and Lake Vista, as well as Lakeshore Drive, the lakefront park system, the University of New Orleans, Lake Terrace, and Lake Oaks. History While Lakeshore and Lake Vista are among New Orleans' newer neighborhoods, the area includes the 18th century Old Spanish Fort, whose origins predate the official founding of the city. The circa 1939 Lake Vista neighborhood is a fine example of the Garden City movement, and is much beloved by its residents for its superblock design devoid of thru-streets and possessing separate, non-intersecting vehicular and pedestrian networks. Lakeshore and Lake Vista lie on land reclaimed from the shallows of Lake Pontchartrain in the early 20th century. Soil was dredged from the lake and a seawall constructed in a project started by the Orleans Levee Board in the 1920s and continued by the Works Progress Administration during the Great Depression. Most of the buildings in this predominantly residential district were not built until after World War II. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, while some homes and businesses flooded (especially those on and near Robert E. Lee Boulevard) the majority of the section - like the majority of the Lakefront - escaped the disastrous post-Katrina flooding of New Orleans, by virtue of the higher elevation of this man-made land. Post- Katrina, the Lakefront appeared as a slender, curiously undamaged and almost wholly recovered zone adjacent to the far lower-lying and hard-hit Lakeview and Gentilly neighborhoods on the other side of Robert E. Lee Boulevard. The Robert E. Lee strip mall at the edge of Lakeshore was flooded by the Hurricane Katrina-induced levee failures Geography Lakeshore/Lake Vista is located at and has an elevation of . According to the United States Census Bureau, the district has a total area of . of which is land and (94.3%) of which is water. The area between the New Basin Canal and the Orleans Canal is the Lakeshore neighborhood, divided into \\"Lakeshore West\\" and \\"Lakeshore East\\" by Canal Boulevard. The Robert E. Lee strip mall occupies the southwest corner of Lakeshore West. East of the Orleans Canal and the linear park along its banks is the Lake Vista neighborhood. Lake Vista was designed along Garden City lines. The entire subdivision is one superblock; that is, arterial streets (e.g., Robert E. Lee, Lakeshore Drive, Marconi) pass around but not through it. All interior streets terminate in culs-de-sac. A separate, all-pedestrian system of circulation is composed of small lanes, all of which flow into axial, pedestrian-only parkways of varying length that, in turn, meet at the center of the development. The original vision for Lake Vista sought to support the pedestrian circulation network as the primary means of movement within the neighborhood by encouraging house designs where the house's front faced either the lane or the parkway; elevations on the vehicular street side were secondary in importance and typically hosted garages or carports. Though some of the original houses in Lake Vista retain this aspect, most newer residential construction has followed a more conventional design, with the front of the house facing the street. Also envisioned for Lake Vista was a town center in the middle of the development, complete with a public school, shops and apartments. Though some apartments were built, without frontage on a major thoroughfare the Streamline Moderne-style commercial structure commissioned for the town center struggled; today the building houses small offices. While the projected public school was never realized, St. Pius X Catholic Church and School were constructed, and today join Lake Vista United Methodist Church and the historic Lake Vista commercial building at the heart of the neighborhood. Though Lake Vista and the other Lakefront neighborhoods of Lakeshore, Lake Terrace and Lake Oaks contain numerous fine examples of mid-20th century modernism, no local or national historic district has been established to bring attention to this unique architectural inventory, or to the noteworthy overall design of New Orleans' Lakefront neighborhood. Lacking local historic district designation to protect the existing built environment from unwarranted demolitions, the mid-20th century architectural fabric of the Lakefront is being slowly eroded as existing residential structures are torn down to accommodate new construction. =Adjacent Neighborhoods= * Lake Pontchartrain (north) * Lake Terrace/Lake Oaks (east) * City Park (south) * Lakeview (south) * West End (west) =Boundaries= The City Planning Commission defines the boundaries of Lakeshore/Lake Vista as these streets: Lake Pontchartrain, Bayou St. John, Robert E. Lee Boulevard, Pontchartrain Boulevard and the New Basin Canal. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 3,615 people, 1,543 households, and 1,056 families residing in the neighborhood. The population density was 3,228 /mi¬≤ (1,247 /km¬≤). As of the census of 2010, there were 3,453 people, 1,435 households, and 971 families residing in the neighborhood.

Biography Ervin Ac√©l was born in Timi»ôoara, the son of a Jewish physician, M√≥ricz Ac√©l, and his wife. He studied in the musical high school in his home town as well as in the Conservatories of Bucharest and of Cluj-Napoca. He began his conducting career in Boto»ôani, where he was active from 1960 to 1963. From 1965 to 1992 he was Chief Conductor of the Oradea Philharmonic Orchestra, in which capacity he also acted as their Administrative Director from 1980 to 1989. He succeeded in greatly raising the artistic level of the ensemble which soon developed into one of Romania's finest orchestras. Besides his numerous concerts, he released some 30 gramophone recordings. During his tenure, he paid special attention to two important composers who had lived in Oradea: Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf and also Michael Haydn, whose symphonies he was the first to record commercially. For a short period between 1981 and 83, Ac√©l was the director of the Istanbul State Opera and Ballet. From 1991 to 1999 he was the Director and Chief Conductor of the Szeged Symphony Orchestra, the second most important orchestra in Hungary. His performances met with great popular success and during this period he performed a most eclectic repertoire ranging from baroque to modern music. With this orchestra he toured extensively, giving performances in 1997 in Portugal (where he appeared with the mezzo-soprano Agnes Baltsa), Russia, Italy and Korea. He also conducted the Staatskapelle Dresden, the Washington Philharmonic Orchestra, the Columbus Symphony Orchestra and participated in many international festivals such as the \\"Giornale Musicale di Vicenza\\", and the Santa Cecilia Conservatory in Rome. Ac√©l was a consummate master of the Viennese Classical Style, giving remarkable performances of the music of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms and Richard Strauss. Possessing a fabulous conducting technique, an extraordinary artistic temperament, and a refined sense for orchestral sound, balance and color, he was also an inspired interpreter of the Russian and French repertories and moreover a specialist of the music of B√©la Bart√≥k. Ervin Ac√®l was an outstanding teacher of orchestral conducting, first organizing masterclasses for young conductors in Romania from 1983, in Hungary (Szeged) from 1992 to 1999, and in Austria (Vienna) from 1996. These courses became well known internationally, attracting numerous students from all over the world. Ac√©l, a polyglot, established an easy rapport with the multinational groups of students, alternating with facility between English, German, Italian, French and also his two mother-tongues, Hungarian and Romanian. His method of instruction was deliberate and considerate and the results most impressive. From 1996, Ac√©l taught conducting at the renowned Vienna Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Darstellende Kunst (formerly the Academy of Music and today the Vienna University of Music) in tandem with the Austrian conductor, Leopold Hager, until his death in 2006. In Italy he performed at Castelgandolfo for Pope John Paul II, conducting the Dances from Galanta by Zolt√°n Kod√°ly with the Philharmonia Hungarica. Besides his teaching responsibilities in Vienna, he continued to conduct in Oradea (from 1999), Satu Mare, Timi»ôoara and several other Romanian and Hungarian cities and also toured throughout Asia (Korea, Taiwan, Japan). Death After a long disease. Ac√©l died on 24 August 2006 in Vienna, aged 71.

According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) census, it had a population of 2,375 in 2007.2007 PCBS Census. Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics. p. 108. Location Talluza is located north of Nablus. It is bordered by al-Badhan and Wadi al Far'a to the east, Yasid to the north, and ‚ÄòAsira ash Shamaliya to the west and south.Talluza Village Profile, ARIJ, p. 4 History Pottery sherds from the Iron Age II and the Byzantine eras have been found here. Although inconclusive, early biblical explorers (RobinsonRobinson (1856), p. 303 and Gu√©rinGu√©rin (1874), p. 366) thought that Talluza was to be identified with the ancient Tirzah of Song of Songs 6:4 and mentioned as one of 31 Canaanite cities conquered by Joshua.Joshua 12:24 In late antiquity, Talluza has been identified as the Samaritan town of Tira Luzeh where the high priest Baba Rabba erected a synagogue in the 4th century CE.Crown, 1989, p. 352 The Talmud mentions the village as \\"Turluzeh\\" where the Romans burnt the sacred Hebrew scrolls. According to Albright, the name \\"Tur-Luzeh\\" (T√ªr L√¥zah) was Aramaic for \\"almond mountain\\". In 1941, a Greek inscription was found bearing the name of \\"Yosef Ben Ya'akov Zechariah\\", a Samaritan from the 4th‚Äì5th centuries. Later, in 1985 a rock-hewn Samaritan burial cave containing three coffins for members of the Samaritan Ptolemayos family was excavated. A handful of glass beads and an oil lamp were also found in the excavation. Inside the village is the maqam (\\"holy tomb\\") of Nabi Harun (\\"the Prophet Aaron\\") according to local tradition. A columbarium and Byzantine ceramics have been found in the village.Dauphin, 1998, p. 767 In 1322, the village was mentioned by Sir John Maundeville under the name of Deluze. Pottery remains have also been found from the early Muslim and medieval eras. =Ottoman era= In 1596, it appeared in Ottoman tax registers as \\"Talluza\\", a village in the nahiya of Jabal Sami in the liwa of Nablus. It had a population of 62 households, all Muslim. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 33.3% on various agricultural products, such as wheat, barley, summer crops, olive trees, goats, and beehives, in addition to \\"occasional revenues\\" and a press for olives or grapes; a total of 9,902 ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 125 In 1838, Edward Robinson classified Talluza as being in the Haritheh district, north of Nablus.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, p. 158, 2nd app, p. 129, no 7 In 1852, he visited Talluza, noting \\"The town is of some size, and tolerably well- built. We saw no remains of antiquity, except for a few sepulchral excavations and some cisterns.\\" Robinson further remarked the house of the village's sheikh was \\"built round a small court in which cattle and horses were stabled.\\"Zertal, 2004, p. 517Robinson and Smith, 1856, pp. 302 -303 Robinson suggested that Talluza might be ancient Tirzah (Latin form: Thersa), one of 31 Canaanite cities the Bible lists as having been conquered by Joshua; the modern Arabic name being a derivation of the ancient name by way of its Hebrew form, or possibly its original Canaanite form, whereby the r sound was replaced with a l. French explorer Victor Gu√©rin also argued that Talluza was the site of ancient Thirza. Later, Conder & Kitchener suggested that Tayasir was a more likely candidate,Conder and Kitchener, SWP II, 1882, pp. 216, 228 however, today Tell el-Farah (North), northeast of modern Nablus is generally accepted as the site of Tirzah. When Gu√©rin visited Talluza in 1870, he described it as being a large village with 1,000‚Äì1,200 inhabitants. He also noted that many of the houses were partially destroyed, and that there were ancient cisterns there.Guerin, 1874, pp. 365-368 ff The PEF's Survey of Western Palestine found in 1882 Talluza to be \\"A good-sized village, well- built, with a central Sheik's house. It stands on a knoll, with a very steep descent on the east, and the sides of the hill are covered with beautiful groves of olives....The women of the village go down to the fine springs on the east, about a mile distant, where there is a perennial supply of good water.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 158 Following the 1908 Young Turk Revolution, clan-based clashes between the inhabitants of Talluza and neighboring Asira ash-Shamaliya broke out in the wake of lax security in the area in the immediate aftermath of the revolution. Two to three men were killed in the fighting which began after Talluza's residents raided and seized Asira's cattle.Macalister, 1921, pp. 128‚Äì129. =British Mandate era= In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Talluza had an entirely Muslim population of 1,116,Barron, 1923, Table IX, p. 24 increasing in the 1931 census when Talluza (including the villages of Wadi al- Badhan and Wadi al-Far'a) had a population of 1,376, still all Muslim, in a total of 323 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 65 In the 1945 statistics, the population was 1,830, all Muslims,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics, 1945, p. 19 while the total land area was 57,710 dunams, according to an official land and population survey.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

In 1961, Talluza had a population of 1,667.Government of Jordan, Department of Statistics, 1964, p. 26 It was further noted (note 2) that it was governed through a village council. Historically Talluza is linked to the village of Wadi al-Far'a since the latter village's lands were previously owned by the residents of Talluza, who used it for agricultural purposes. In the 1960s residents from Talluza settled in Wadi al-Far'a and established a separate village.Wadi al-Far'a Village Profile Applied Research Institute - Jerusalem. February 2006. =1967-present= After the Six-Day War in 1967, Talluza has been under Israeli occupation. Under the interim Oslo Peace Accords, areas of the West Bank, which Israel occupied in the 1967 Mideast war, were divided into various categories. According to ARIJ, 99% of the village land is in Area A, where the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) holds responsibility for internal security and public order, the remainder 1% of land being in Area B.The Palestinian Locality Profiles, Talluza Village Profile, p. 16. In 1996 Wadi al-Far'a was officially separated from Talluza and was granted its own village council under the administration of the Tubas Governorate. Geography Situated on the northern part of Mount Ebal along the slope of a plateau, Talluza has an average elevation of above sea level. Its ancient village center is small and surrounded by relatively newer building structures. There are 50 cisterns in the village and the nearest source of water is away from the village at Ein al-Beida. Talluza is located off the road connecting Nablus with Asira ash-Shamaliya,Zertal, 2004, p. 516 and nearby localities the latter to the southwest, Yasid to the northwest, Far'a Camp to the northeast and Ein al-Beida to the southeast.

It stars Victoria Abril, Yohana Cobo and Juan Diego. The plot, based on a true story, follows a bitter rivalry between two families that started with an ill-fated love affair, and grows over three decades. The screenplay was written by Ray Loriga. Plot In an isolated village in Extremadura, the Jim√©nez and Fuentes families have a violent history of land disputes, jealousy, envy, and violence. The hatred between the two families begins in the 1960s as a love story, between Amadeo Jim√©nez and Luciana Fuentes. Their romance ends when the fickle Amadeo drops Luciana, when she already has prepared for marriage. Feeling betrayed, Luciana expresses a vengeful wish on her seducer in the presence of her fragmented, devoted brother Jer√≥nimo who, in turn, executes his sister's wish, resulting in the young man's cold and brutal murder in an open field. Despite Jer√≥nimo's capture and 30-year prison sentence, the shame on the Fuentes family still proves to be terrible burden as the townspeople continue to treat the siblings with open contempt and derision, culminating one day in a suspicious fire that engulfs the family home with their mother still inside. The Fuentes siblings move to a nearby village to avoid direct contact with the Jimenez family headed by Amadeo‚Äôs brother, Jos√©, who feels the two families are now even. Humiliated, forcibly driven out of town, and struggling with Luciana's delusional obsession over her broken engagement, the Fuentes's harbored animosity festers with each passing year, awaiting Jer√≥nimo's release and pondering the inevitable day of reckoning against the community that had turned its back against them. Two decades later when Jer√≥nimo is released from jail, he rushes to look for J√≥se and stabs him. J√≥se survives. Carmen, J√≥se's wife, deeply affected by the attempt on her husband‚Äôs life, pressures him to leave the village and move out to a big city, but Antonio is unable to sell his butcher shop for the money he is asking, and refuses to leave town out of fear. The events are narrated by Isabel, the oldest of Jos√©‚Äôs three young daughters. A summer romance develops between the teenager Isabel and Chino, a young rebel who goes around town riding his motorcycle. He is sincere in his affections and she falls for him. With his help, Isabel is determined to discover the seed of hatred that has tragically marked the story of the two families for more than thirty years. There is a town crazy, a \\"tonto\\", that watched Jose light the Fuentes house on fire. However, Isabel dismisses the testimony of the slow-witted, drug-addicted witness, the child of an incestuous relationship. Isabel‚Äôs love for Chino ends, before it has time to deepen, when Chino is forced to leave town abruptly fleeing the authorities that have discovered his illicit drug dealing. He gives her a gold chain as a farewell gift. Upset, she throws the chain into a swimming pool then dives in to retrieve it. \\"On the seventh day of creating the world, God rested\\", Isabel notes, and that is why the most horrible things happen on Sunday. One Sunday the two aging brothers Antonio and Emilio Fuentes come to town with shotguns and ammunition. Their revenge engulfs the entire village and its inhabitants pay with their blood. Systematically and in cold blood, they gun down every person that cross their path beginning with the three young Jim√©nez sisters. Nine (9) are killed, 12 are injured. When the killing spree is over, Isabel is among the wounded survivors, but her two sisters Antonia and Encarna are, like many others, dead. When the police look for the two Fuentes brothers, they find them in a field and they do not struggle to be arrested. The two Fuentes sisters go to an asylum. The next day, the Fuentes brothers are captured and sent to jail for life. Their two sisters, Luciana and √Ångela, are also found guilty, but regarded as mentally unstable, they are locked away in a mental institution. Isabel Jim√©nez and her mother (Carmen) move to a city on the coast, leaving J√≥se behind. He has refused to leave the village. Isabel beholds a picture of happier times in which she is with her sisters.

Early life and family Pickard was born in Kippax near Leeds in the West Riding of Yorkshire the son of a collier. He started work as a pit- boy at the age of twelve years. He earned a reputation as a studious boy and attended Kippax School. He also received religious training as a Wesleyan, becoming a local preacher and was connected with the Lord's Rest Day Association throughout his life. He was associated from an early age with the trade union movement becoming lodge secretary at the age of sixteen. In 1864 he married Hannah Elizabeth Freeman of Kippax and they had four sons and four daughters. His wife died in 1901. Trade union official In 1873 Pickard was appointed assistant secretary of the West Yorkshire Miners' Association and in 1876 he became secretary. He was responsible for uniting the West and South Yorkshire Miners' Associations into one body in 1881 and became the first secretary of the Yorkshire Miners' Association. In 1877 he was assistant secretary of the Miners' National Union and was a leading player in the foundation of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain, of which he was elected the first president. In 1893 Pickard led the miners in the biggest industrial dispute the country had hitherto seen. The result of the combined strike and lockout was the establishment of a Board of Conciliation to address problems arising in the industry and most disputes over the coming years were settled using this machinery. He played an active part in obtaining legislation in the mining industry including the Eight Hours Bill, restricting the hours miners could work underground, although it did not become law until after his death. International work Pickard was active in establishing the International Federation of Mineworkers in 1890. He organised six international congresses of miners from Britain, Germany, Austria, France and Belgium which were held in Paris, Jolimont near La Louvi√®re, Brussels, Berlin, Aix-la-Chapelle and London. He also attended about eighteen Trade Union Congresses. In 1897 his interest in arbitration and the work of the Peace Society led to his inclusion in a peace deputation to Grover Cleveland, President of the United States. Politics In addition to his commitment to the interests of organised labour, Pickard was known as an 'ardent liberal'. He served as a member of the Wakefield School Board from 1881 until 1885 and in 1889 was appointed an alderman of the West Riding County Council on which he was a co-opted member. He was re-elected alderman in 1895 and 1901. In 1885 the Yorkshire Miners Association came to an agreement with the Liberal Party allowing the association to nominate the candidate for elections to Parliament for the Normanton division of Yorkshire, a constituency in which more than 60% of the electorate were coal miners. Pickard was selected and won the seat at each election under this arrangement from 1885 until his death in 1904. In return he generally supported the Liberals in Parliament. Death Pickard died of heart failure in Westminster in 1904, having been ill for some time.

Shell of Cochlicella acuta This species does well on sandy calcareous soils, and often prefers a coastal setting such as sand dunes. It aestivates by attaching itself to vertical surfaces such as fence posts, tall weeds and so on. Shell description The shell of this species is an unusual shape for a helicid, elongatedly conical, 10 to 20 mm high, with a width of only 4 to 7 mm. The spire tapers regularly, but ends in a blunt tip. The oval aperture has a thin lip, and the narrow umbilicus is almost covered. The shell is very variable in color and markings, often having a cream or off-white background with many pale brown blotches, which are sometimes organized into spiral bands. The shell is often streaked across the whorls with brown. There are sometimes two spiral bands of dark brown or black, which are frequently reduced to only one band, restricted to the body-whorl. Sometimes there are no bands at all. Welter-Schultes description. For terms see gastropod shell The 9-15 x 4-7 mm shell has 8-11 whorls, in juvenile specimens with a sharp edge. It is evenly white or with brown spots. The shell is less brownish, more slender and higher than the shell of Cochlicella barbara and upper whorls are slightly more rounded in C. acuta (juveniles have a much sharper edge at the periphery of the lowest whorl). The animal is very light yellowish, dorsum with blackish brown pigments, one dark medial line on dorsum, two dark lines (= retractor muscles) from the sides to the upper tentacles.

He has previously played for the San Francisco Giants, Los Angeles Dodgers, Tampa Bay Rays, and Miami Marlins. As a closer for the Giants, he recorded three saves during the 2012 World Series, helping the Giants win the title. During the playoffs, he had saves in the clinching games of the NL Division Series and the World Series. Early life Romo was born in Brawley, California to Mexican parents. He grew up a Los Angeles Dodgers fan.https://www.denverpost.com/2017/02/17/sergio-romo-los-angeles-dodgers/ His grandfather and father both played baseball; his grandfather was a member of the Mexico City Diablos Rojos. Frank, Sergio's father, built a pitching mound in the backyard and taught Romo how to throw. He graduated from Brawley Union High School in 2001, having played shortstop and third base on the baseball team. With no scholarship offers from four-year colleges, Romo nearly signed enlistment papers to follow his father in the U.S. Navy, but opted to play baseball at junior college instead. College career Romo went to Orange Coast College before transferring to Arizona Western College. Romo was named to the All-Region I second team of the Arizona Community College Athletic Conference in 2002 and 2003. In 159 innings, Romo earned a 16-4 overall record with a 2.79 earned run average (ERA). For his junior and senior years, Romo played NCAA Division II baseball at two colleges: the University of North Alabama (2004) and Mesa State College (2005). He was named First-Team All-Gulf South Conference in 2004 while playing for North Alabama and was 10‚Äì3 with a 3.69 ERA in 97.1 innings. In his senior year with Mesa State, he was the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference Pitcher of the Year. In 2009, the RMAC named Romo \\"All-Time Top Pitcher.\\" Professional career =San Francisco Giants= Romo was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 28th round (852nd overall) of the 2005 Major League Baseball draft. He began his professional career with the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes of the Single-A short season Northwest League. Used as a starter, he had a 7-1 record and a 2.75 ERA in innings. His seven wins led the Northwest League, while his 65 strikeouts ranked ninth. The following year, Romo was assigned to the Augusta GreenJackets of the Single-A South Atlantic League. In 31 games (10 starts) he had a 10-2 record, a 2.53 ERA, 95 strikeouts, and four saves in innings. He made 41 relief appearances for the San Jose Giants of the Single-A advanced California League in 2007, compiling a 6-2 record, a 1.36 ERA, 106 strikeouts, and nine saves in innings of work. Romo's 14.38 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched was the fourth-best mark in the minors, and milb.com named Romo the Class A Advanced Relief Pitcher of the Year. Aided by his contributions, San Jose won the California League championship. Romo began the 2008 season with the Double-A Connecticut Defenders of the Eastern League. Used as the closer, he had 11 saves in 27 games, and his ERA was 4.00. 2008-09 Romo had his contract purchased by the San Francisco Giants on June 24, 2008, when Vinnie Chulk was designated for assignment. He made his big league debut on June 26, 2008, in a 4-1 loss to the Cleveland Indians, striking out two in an inning pitched. Romo posted a 2.35 ERA in his first 15 games but was designated for assignment on August 6, because the Giants were adding up two relief pitchers. Romo was on trade waivers at the time and thus could not be optioned to the minors. He was eventually sent to the minors, but was recalled on August 16, when Jonathan S√°nchez was placed on the disabled list. Romo replaced Matt Palmer in the bullpen as Palmer took S√°nchez's rotation spot. During the 2008 season, Romo dominated left-handed hitters, which is unusual for a right-handed pitcher. In 29 games as a rookie, Romo had a 3-1 record, a 2.12 ERA, 33 strikeouts, and eight walks in 34 innings. He played winter baseball with the √Åguilas de Mexicali of the Mexican Pacific League. In nine relief appearances, Romo made six of seven attempted saves and posted a 2.89 ERA. Romo started the 2009 season on the disabled list with a right elbow sprain, and was activated on May 30, 2009. From June 5 through June 20, he threw scoreless innings, allowing just two hits. He picked up wins on both June 19 and 20, against the Texas Rangers. He completed his first major league save on July 7 against the Florida Marlins. He got the last two outs of the game, both of which were via the strikeout. Romo had a 2.31 ERA through July 11, but in four games between July 11 and 20, he gave up seven runs in two innings, raising his ERA to 6.59. He then had a 2.21 ERA in his final 27 games, which brought his ERA down to 3.97 at the end of the year. In 45 games, he had a 5-2 record, 41 strikeouts, and 11 walks in 34 innings. He was one of eight NL relievers to allow one or fewer home runs. Romo also stranded 92.9% of inherited runners, second in the NL to Juan Rinc√≥n's 95%. 2010-2016 Romo with the San Francisco Giants in 2010 Romo got off to a tough start to the 2010 season, posting a 4.50 ERA through his first 14 games and losing three of them. Starting May 9, he posted a 1.50 ERA in his final 54 games of the year. In mid-June, Giants' manager Bruce Bochy removed the struggling Guillermo Mota from the setup role and replaced him with Romo, who held it for the rest of the regular season. Romo gained notoriety for being one of the team's \\"Beards\\", along with LHP Jeremy Affeldt and closer Brian Wilson. In 68 games (second to Wilson on the Giants), Romo had a 5-3 record, a 2.18 ERA, 70 strikeouts, and 14 walks in 62 innings. This year, he held right-handed batters to a .185 average. His 5.00 strikeout- to-walk ratio ranked sixth among NL relievers, and his 2.18 ERA ranked 10th. In Game 2 of the National League Division Series (NLDS) against the Atlanta Braves, Romo gave up two hits without recording an out; both runners scored as the Giants went on to blow a three-run lead and lose 5-4 in 11 innings. Romo replaced S√°nchez in the eighth inning of Game 3 and allowed a go-ahead two-run home run to Eric Hinske but was charged with the win as the Giants rallied in the ninth to win 3-2. The Giants won the series in four games. In Game 4 of the NL Championship Series (NLCS) against the Philadelphia Phillies, Romo gave up an RBI double to Jayson Werth and was charged with a blown save, but the Giants won 6-5. He held the Phillies scoreless in his other two outings of the series (losses in Games 2 and 5), and the Giants won the series in six games. Romo made one appearance in the World Series against the Texas Rangers, throwing of a scoreless eighth inning in the Giants' 11-7 victory. Romo earned his first World Series ring as the Giants won the series in five games to win their first title since 1954. In 2011, Romo became the fifth reliever in MLB history to throw nine or more consecutive perfect innings, retiring thirty straight batters in 10 innings over a span of fourteen games from July 4 through August 6. From August 16 through August 28, he was on the disabled list with right elbow inflammation. From June 30 through September 23, he had the longest scoreless streak of his career, throwing scoreless innings. Romo appeared in 65 games in 2011; his stat line for the year was: 3-1 record, 1.50 ERA, 70 strikeouts, five walks, 13.1 K/9, and .9 BB/9 in 48 innings. His ERA was the third-lowest among NL relievers, and his strikeout-to-walk ratio of 14:1 was the best in MLB and the best ever since Dennis Eckersley's 18.25:1 ratio in 1990. He stranded 81.8% of runners (fifth in the NL) and trailed only Kris Medlen in strike percentage (71%) among NL pitchers with at least 20 innings pitched. Romo performed very well to begin the 2012 season and did not allow an earned run until May 17, 2012. After Brian Wilson underwent Tommy John surgery in April, Santiago Casilla was given the closer role. Casilla blew five out of ten saves entering August, however; Bochy announced on August 7 that the Giants would use a \\"bullpen by committee\\" strategy, with Romo, Javier L√≥pez, and Jeremy Affeldt pitching the final two innings of close games, depending on which hitters they would be facing. Romo and L√≥pez received most of the save opportunities; Affeldt only had one save after that point. From then through the end of the season, Romo converted nine out of nine save opportunities and posted a 1.33 ERA. Romo appeared in 69 games of the 2012 season, earning 14 saves with a 1.79 ERA, which was fourth among NL relievers and trailed only Craig Kimbrel (1.01), Aroldis Chapman (1.51) and Eric O'Flaherty (1.73). The Giants won the NL West; in the NLDS against the Cincinnati Reds, Romo appeared in three games, winning Game 3 and saving Game 5. He pitched in all four of the Giants' wins in the NLCS against the St. Louis Cardinals but did not get a single save opportunity. However, in the World Series against the Detroit Tigers, he made three appearances and recorded the save in each of them. He pitched the final inning of the deciding Game 4 and struck out three straight, including Miguel Cabrera for the last out and the Giants' win. In the World Series, Romo pitched three perfect innings and had five strikeouts. Romo pitching for the Giants in 2013 In February 2013, Romo and the Giants agreed to a two-year, $9 million contract. Romo began the 2013 season as the Giants' closer. He had 10 saves in April, second in Giants' history for the month to Rod Beck (11). On July 14, he was added to the NL All Star Game roster after Jeff Locke and Jordan Zimmermann made starts on Sunday and became ineligible to pitch. It was the first All- Star selection of his career. However, Romo was not used in the All-Star Game. In August, Romo converted all nine of his save opportunities. Romo finished the 2013 season with a 2.54 earned run average and 38 saves in 43 chances, appearing in 65 games. He had a career-high five wins but also a career-high eight losses. His 38 saves made him the sixth Giant to achieve 30 saves in a season and tied him for third in the league with Chapman, behind Kimbrel's 50 and Rafael Soriano's 43. Romo began the 2014 season well, with a 1.65 ERA and 12 saves through May 9. However, Romo struggled after that, recording five blown saves and a 9.00 ERA from May 9 to June 30. Romo was removed from the closer role on that date, with the Giants announcing their intention to go to a closer-by-committee. Used as the eighth inning setup man for the remainder of the season, Romo appeared 30 times after July 1 and had a 2.10 ERA over innings with 32 strikeouts and 5 walks. He finished the year 6-4 with a 3.72 ERA, 59 strikeouts in 58 innings, and 12 walks over 64 games. In save opportunities, he was 23 for 28. In the 2014 NLDS against the Washington Nationals, Romo pitched three scoreless innings over three games. He took the loss in Game 2 of the NLCS against the Cardinals after allowing a game-ending home run to Kolten Wong. He recovered to earn the win in Game 3 by retiring Matt Holliday as the Giants won in extra innings. In the 2014 World Series, Romo appeared in two games, pitching 2 innings with 4 strikeouts and no runs allowed, earning his third World Series championship with the Giants. On December 22, 2014, Romo and the Giants finalized a two-year contract worth $15 million. On August 30 at AT&T; Park against the Arizona Diamondbacks, Romo came into his five-hundredth career game, becoming the fifth Giants pitcher in franchise history to appear in at least five hundred games. =Los Angeles Dodgers= Romo signed a one-year, $3 million, contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers on February 15, 2017. In 30 games for the Dodgers, he allowed 17 runs in 25 innings and he was designated for assignment on July 20, 2017. =Tampa Bay Rays= On July 22, 2017, the Dodgers traded Romo to the Tampa Bay Rays for cash considerations or a player to be named later (PTBNL). In 2017 he threw a slider 58.4% of the time, tops in MLB.Statcast Pitch Arsenals Leaderboard  baseballsavant.com He re-signed with the Rays on a one-year, $2.5 million, contract on February 13, 2018. After 588 major league relief appearances, Romo made his first career start on May 19, 2018, as the Rays' opener, pitching one scoreless inning against the Los Angeles Angels, striking out the side. He started again the next day, pitching 1 scoreless innings and becoming the first pitcher since Zack Greinke in 2012 to start on consecutive days. On August 19, Romo recorded his 100th career save. For the season, he appeared in a career high 73 games while collecting 25 saves. In innings, he struck out 75. =Miami Marlins= On February 12, 2019, Romo signed a one- year, $2.5 million deal with the Miami Marlins. He served as the closer up until late July, recording 17 saves in 38 appearances. =Minnesota Twins= On July 27, 2019, the Marlins traded Romo, Chris Vallimont, and a PTBNL to the Minnesota Twins for Lewin D√≠az. On December 16, 2019, Romo elected to return to the Twins for the 2020 season, signing a 1-year, $5M deal. The deal also contains a club option for 2021. Pitches With a low-three quarters delivery Romo features three pitches: a unique no dot slider that sits 75‚Äì79 mph which he uses against right-handed batters, a two-seam fastball sitting 88‚Äì90, and a change up which he uses against left-handed hitters, sitting 80‚Äì83. Romo possesses the ability to analyze and correct his own mistakes, which he has done since his rookie season. After one game in 2008, Romo, while watching video, noted he had been leaning over more than usual in the game. He said, \\"I felt like I was overcorrecting just a little bit\\", and worried that this affected his pitch command. Through 2013, Romo led all post-integration MLB pitchers in lowest career FIP with a minimum of 250 innings pitched. His career 2.24 ERA was second only to Mariano Rivera. Personal life Sergio had his first child, a boy, Rilen Serge Romo, in January 2006, followed by his second son, Rex Ryder Romo, in September 2011.

Tarbox's career statistics were fairly modest, but as his obituary in Wisden noted, he frequently chipped in with a few useful runs or wickets, valuable commodities for the generally weak Worcestershire sides of the day. He achieved his best innings figures in his first season of 1921, in only the seventh match of his first-class career, when in June he claimed 7‚Äì55 against Somerset at Worcester. A few weeks later, and against the same opponents, he achieved what was to prove his only ten-wicket match haul, picking up 4‚Äì126 and then 6‚Äì32 in a big Worcestershire victory at Taunton. He ended 1921 with 629 runs at 17.97 and 47 wickets at 27.29. Wisden said that Tarbox \\"never fulfilled the promise\\" of that first season. However, he continued to put in useful performances and was generally a regular in the team. His most productive seasons with the ball were 1927 and 1928, when he took 81 and 79 wickets respectively. As a batsman, the highlights were the only two centuries of his career: 103 not out against local rivals Warwickshire at Edgbaston in May 1925, and 109 ‚Äì in an innings in which the second highest score was 29 ‚Äì against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge in July 1927. The 1929 season was a very poor one for Tarbox ‚Äì he averaged under 12 with the bat and over 42 with the ball ‚Äì and Worcestershire released him at the end of the summer. That was the end of his first-class playing career, but he returned to his home county of Hertfordshire and played for them for several years in the Minor Counties Championship; for them he scored relatively few runs but took many wickets, including 6‚Äì13 against Berkshire in July 1931. After his last game for Hertfordshire in 1934, Tarbox became an umpire, and stood in over 150 English first-class games between 1936 and 1947. He then added another ten matches as an umpire in South Africa.

The museum has no permanent displays due to conservation issues. When exhibitions are on it is open daily except Mondays and public holidays; an admission fee is charged and varies depending on the exhibition programmed. The museum opened its doors again 28 September 2013 after being closed for major renovation. Palais Galliera is one of the 14 City of Paris museums that have been incorporated since 1 January 2013 in the public institution Paris Mus√©es. History The Duke of Galliera was a partner in the urban planning firm Thome & Cie, and owned a large parcel of land in one of the finest neighborhoods in Paris. Upon his death in 1876, his wife, Marie Brignole-Sale de Ferrari, the Duchesse de Galliera, became heir to his immense fortune. The duchess decided that she wanted to use the land to build a museum, at her expense, to hold their works of arts. According to her wishes, a notary prepared a deed of gift to give the land parcel to the French state. However, after the gift was registered and accepted by presidential decree on 30 August 1879, it was discovered that the notary had made a serious error. Rather than donating the parcel to France, the deed was written as a gift to the City of Paris. Unable to change the deed at this point, the gift remained as written. Construction of the museum began in 1879 on an opulent design by architect L√©on Ginain, who also supervised its construction. In 1884, the Duchess gave 6.5 million francs to the City of Paris for work already done as well as funds necessary to complete it. On 22 June 1886, Jules Gr√©vy and Georges Clemenceau convened the Chamber of Deputies of the French Third Republic and adopted a law expelling any person who was a direct heir of a royalist dynasty that had reigned in France. The Duchess Galliera, who had descended from the House of Orl√©ans, was outraged by the law, no less because she had already donated the H√¥tel Matignon to France. Unable to revoke her gift of the new museum, she abandoned the rest of her planned legacy to Paris. Thus, her collection of paintings and fine art were given to Genoa, Italy, where they are now displayed at the Palazzo Rosso and Palazzo Bianco. The Duchess died in December 1888, before the museum was completed, but in May 1889, her heirs gave the City of Paris 1.3 million francs to finish its construction. L√©on Ginain completed the museum in February 1894, which was officially received by the city a few months later, in July. In the absence of the Galliera art collection, for which it was designed, the City of Paris used the museum for temporary displays. The first exhibition, devoted to portraits of women and lace, was inaugurated by President F√©lix Faure on 1 March 1895. It became a museum of industrial arts in 1902, and later, it served as space for temporary shows of modern art. The city also rented it to auctioneers for prestigious sales. The building The Palais Galliera faces Brignole Galliera Square, immediately north of the Palais de Tokyo and one block east of the Mus√©e Guimet. The architect L√©on Ginain based his design on a palace that the Duchess Galliera owned in Genoa. The building is faced in cut stone in the Italian Renaissance style supported by an underframe of steel, constructed by the Eiffel Company. The mosaic floors and domes are the work of Giandomenico Facchina (1826‚Äì1904). The statues on the fa√ßade that fronts Avenue du President Wilson represent \\"Painting\\" by Henri Chapu, \\"Architecture\\" by Jules Thomas, and \\"Sculpture\\" by Peter Cavelier. In 1916, a fountain was built in front of the museum. Fashion Museum Since 1977, the City of Paris has operated the Palais Galliera as the Mus√©e de la Mode de la Ville de Paris, a permanent museum devoted to fashion. It displays exhibits of French fashion design and costume from the eighteenth century to the present day. The museum is closed in between exhibitions. In December 2017, the fashion historian Miren Arzalluz was named as the director of the Palais Galliera. The museum's holdings contain about 70,000 items, and are organized as follows: * Costumes - from the 18th century to the present, including clothes owned by Marie-Antoinette, Louis XVII, and the Empress Josephine, the dress worn by Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), and displays of fashions by the leading 19th and 20th century designers including Balenciaga, Pierre Balmain, Anne-Marie Beretta, Louise Ch√©ruit, Sonia Delaunay, Christian Dior, Jacques Fath, Mariano Fortuny, Jean Paul Gaultier, Givenchy, Paul Poiret, Paco Rabanne, Yves Saint Laurent, and Elsa Schiaparelli. * Undergarments - an excellent collection of slips, corsets, crinolines, etc. * Accessories - including jewelry, canes, hats, fans, purses, scarves, gloves (including a pair owned by Sarah Bernhardt), parasols, and umbrellas. * Graphic arts and photography - stamps, drawings, photography, advertisements, etc. See also * List of museums in Paris References * Hubert Demory, Auteuil et Passy : De l'Annexion √† la Grande Guerre, Paris:L'Harmattan, * B√©atrice de Andia, Le 16e : Chaillot - Passy - Auteuil : M√©tamorphose des trois villages, Paris:D√©l√©gation √† l'Action Artistique de la Ville de Paris, External links * Official Palais Galliera site * Galliera Museum page on Paris Mus√©es' website * Paris Mus√©es official website * ParisInfo entry Category:Museums in Paris Category:Buildings and structures in the 16th arrondissement of Paris Category:Fashion museums in France Category:Museums established in 1895 Category:1895 establishments in France Category:Paris Mus√©es ","title":"Palais Galliera"},{"id":"18119003","text":"HD 88836 is a double star in the southern constellation of Antlia.

For decades Lakewood Country Club operated in the neighborhood, predating most residential construction and bestowing its name upon the developing area. With the finalization of I-10's and I-610's routes in the 1960s, much of Lakewood's golf course was expropriated for the sprawling I-10/I-610 interchange. Lakewood Country Club relocated to the Algiers neighborhood, on the West Bank of the Mississippi River, and the remainder of the golf course was developed as the Lakewood North and Lakewood South subdivisions. The former clubhouse remained for years, visible from I-10 and lastly used as the main building for the now- closed New Orleans Academy.

The museum houses artifacts, memorabilia, photographs, and manuscripts pertaining to Rogers' life, and documentaries, speeches, and movies starring Rogers are shown in a theater. Rogers' tomb is located on its grounds overlooking Claremore and Rogers State University. Until March 7, 2016, the museum was managed by the Will Rogers Memorial Commission, a state agency. On that date, the Governor of Oklahoma signed legislation dissolving the state commission and transferring the property and all its assets to the Oklahoma Historical Society, another state agency. History Interior, with Jo Davidson's statue Will Rogers was born near Oologah, Oklahoma, where his father had settled. He had originally purchased the land in 1911, a plot containing that overlooks the Tiawah Valley, as the site of his retirement home. The price was reportedly $500 per acre. After his death, it was passed on to members of the Rogers family. Will's widow, Betty Rogers, donated the property in 1937, during the Great Depression, to the state of Oklahoma. The Oklahoma legislature appropriated $200,000 for the construction of a museum honoring Rogers. The original limestone building was designed by John Duncan Forsyth. Groundbreaking occurred April 21, 1938, with Will's sister, Sallie Rogers McSpadden, turning the first spadeful of dirt. Construction was completed November 4, 1938, on what would have been Rogers' 59th birthday.\\"Will Rogers Memorial Museum in Claremore, Oklahoma.\\" Accessed April 6, 2016. The museum opened in 1938, three years after Rogers' death. An addition was constructed in 1983. Interior The rotunda contains a famous sculpture of Will Rogers by artist Jo Davidson. The pedestal is inscribed with a famous quotation by Rogers, \\"...I never met a man I didn't like.\\" The statue is another cast of the work that the artist created in 1938 and which has represented the state in the National Statuary Hall at the United States Capitol. The 1983 addition includes a large library and offices that serve as research areas for scholars and writers. This area covers and holds more than 2000 volumes relevant to Will Rogers, plus other topics such as Indians, genealogy, vaudeville, early motion pictures. and history of the 1879‚Äì1935 era. Museum archives also contain an estimated 18,000 photographs, as well as thousands of original manuscripts, private letters, contracts, and personal papers, as well as motion pictures, home movies, and audio tapes. Exterior The tomb of Will Rogers is outside the building, and overlooks the city of Claremore. Other family members interred there are Rogers' wife, Betty (1879‚Äì1944), three of their four children: Fred Stone Rogers (1918‚Äì1920), Mary Amelia Rogers Brooks (1913‚Äì1989), and James Blake (Jim) Rogers (1915‚Äì2000). Jim's wife, Marguerite Astrea Kemmler Rogers (1917‚Äì1987) as well as Jim's oldest son, James Kemmler (Kem) Rogers (1939‚Äì2014) are also interred there. Merger with the Oklahoma Historical Society On March 7, 2016, Governor Mary Fallin signed Senate Bill 1570 into law, which put the Will Rogers Memorial Commission, which governed both the Will Rogers Memorial Museum and the Dog Iron Ranch, Will Rogers' birthplace in Oologah, under the control of the Oklahoma Historical Society. The new law became effective immediately.\\"Will Rogers Memorial Commission Transferred To Oklahoma Historical Society.\\" News on 6. March 7, 2016. Accessed April 9, 2016. There was little opposition to the merger, which was unanimously approved by the Joint Appropriations Budget Committees of both the Oklahoma House of Representatives and the Senate. Tad Jones, director of the Memorial, noted that the Memorial had previously been targeted by political budget cutters for several years, and a bill had been introduced during the previous year to eliminate state contributions to the museum. He expressed a belief that the merger would reduce pressure to cut the museum's funding.Sturgill, Kristy, \\"Legislation proposes merging Will Rogers Memorial with Oklahoma Historical Society.\\" Claremore Progress.

The merger was enthusiastically approved by Rogers' descendants, according to Jennifer Rogers-Etcheverry, a member of the Will Rogers Memorial Commission and great-granddaughter of Will Rogers. She said that she saw no disadvantages to the merger. The Act also requires that the governor appoint a direct descendant of Rogers to the OHS board of directors.

The poem was also included in one of Morris's volumes of collected poems, The Deserted Bride and Other Poems, 1838, which ran into several editions. Morris was friends with artist Robert Walter Weir to whom he dedicated his only book of prose, The Little Frenchman and His Water Lots (1839).Callow, James T. Kindred Spirits: Knickerbocker Writers and American Artists, 1807‚Äì1855. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1967: 238. A collection of short stories and sketches, the little Frenchman of the title story was the victim of an unscrupulous dealer in real estate bordering Wallabout Bay, that was under water at high tide. Morris died July 6, 1864. Horace Binney Wallace wrote the introductory biographical notice for Morris's posthumous collected works. Critical response Critic and writer Edgar Allan Poe acknowledged the popularity of Morris's songs, \\"which have taken fast hold upon the popular taste, and which are deservedly celebrated\\". In April 1840, Poe wrote that Morris was \\"very decidedly, our best writer of songs‚Äîand, in saying this, I mean to assign him a high rank as poet\\".Sova, Dawn B. Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z. New York: Checkmark Books, 2001: 169.

It used the newly developed 2N404 germanium transistor instead of vacuum tubes. It consisted of a KG-3 transmitter a KG-12 receiver. The transmitter used about 500 transistors and the receiver about 300. The transmitter was switchable to function as a receiver. KG-13 (PONTUS)  The KG-13 Electronic Key Generator, Transmitter/Receiver was similar in appearance to the KG-14. This solid state design dating from the mid-to-late 1960s, originally cost $13,000 per copy. It was one of the first crypto machines to encrypt data such as facsimile. Crypto technicians received 10 to 12 weeks training on the machine. The KG-13 was composed of a KG-3 transmitter and a KG-12 receiver. A KG-13 unit. One drawer bears the designation KGD-3/TSEC. The total weight is around 250 pounds. The KG-13 was controlled by \\"key cards\\". These were IBM-like punch cards that determined the starting point of the KG-13 encryption which was done by \\"koken stages\\". The key cards were changed daily at HJ time. When the USS Pueblo, with a KG-13 aboard, was captured by the North Koreans in 1968, the personnel didn't have time to destroy it. As a result, a working model of the KG-13 fell into enemy hands. NSA quickly designed a modification to the koken stage board to alter its operation in order that the enemy didn't have an identical working model. =Card Reader Description= Select this link to see the inside of the card reader. Ronald Coppock, who worked with the KG-13 indicates that it was fitted with a card cutter and also without. \\"In Ethiopia, I worked at two locations (Stonehouse and Tract C) that had KG13's equipped with the KW26 style card cutters. All the machines at Stonehouse were equipped that way and about 20% at Tract C. At the 7th Radio Research in South East Asia, about 30% of the KG13's had the card cutter style card readers. 13's equipped with the card cutters were operated on very high priority circuits with short cycles to change key material. Some were on 6 hour and others on 12 hour cycles\\". The KG-13 did have a major difference in that in its latter years, it was equipped with a Card Reader Insert Board or CRIB. =Internal Description= The KG-13 employed \\"FLYBALL\\" modules. These were modules made of discrete components set up as logic element circuit groups such as NAND gates, NOR gates, XOR gates, flip flops, monostables, multivibrators, etc. Once tested, the modules were potted in a compound whose colour indicated their function. The coloured potting compound was extremely hard and any attempt to penetrate it resulted in damage to the internal circuitry. In a KG-13, the following colours are confirmed: Pink, Yellow, Green, Blue, Red, Orange and Black. Purple and Brown modules were probably used but those colours are unconfirmed as of this time. Yellow modules were single transistor emitter follower clock drivers. Pink modules were two transistor shift register flip flops. Each yellow module drove nine pink ones. A two transistor multivibrator module drove the audio alarm thru an amplifier. Two transistor monostables were also used. NAND and NOR modules were built from a single transistor and XOR modules were built from two transistors. Failures usually occurred in the power supplies, buffers, and synchronizers though most problems were quickly resolved. When new, there was a high frequency of failures due to cold solder joints. One board in the KG-13 had a black module which was a noise generator containing a Zener diode noise source. This was the only classified module because the noise was used to randomize the key stream on startup. The circuitry inside the module then used the koken chain shift registers to create an pseudo random key stream. That was why there was no problem in restarting the KG-13 with the same card. The noise source ensured that the chances of duplicating the start point was negligible. Two of the key cards were for the transmitter and the third for the receiver. There were two for the transmitter because it had two key generators. The keystream mixed with the plain text produced the ciphertext. Two key generators generating the same keystream should match bit for bit at the output and a mismatch would cause a crypto alarm and a shutdown of the output. A key generator failure would stop transmission and prevent a compromise. With only a single key generator in the transmitter a failure could produce a trivial keystream (all one's, all zero's or alternations). A receiver key generator failure just produced garble. The KG-3 could be used to transmit or receive since there is a XMIT/RECV switch on in the lower right hand portion of the lowest unit. In the 1964/65 time frame, crypto techs were taught that it would take 50,000 years to break the key on a KG-13 using state of the art techniques which were available at the time. The KG-13 also employed traffic flow security. Steve Gardner recalls \\"One of our operations sites which monitored satellites used an item called a \\"shark\\" between the teletype and the KG-13. It was a block message transceiver\\". KG-13's were taken out of service around 1989-90. This was one of the last discrete component crypto machines built. Shortly after this time, integrated circuits started to appear in crypto machine designs. An illustrated article describing its arrival at the museum appeared in the Spring 2004 issue of the NCMF internal publication, \\"The Link\\". As of 2010, the KG-13 is in storage.

History =Founding= Crosscut was founded in 2007 by David Brewster,Idealog: Crosscut.com, new online daily for the Northwest, launches April 2, 2007 who also started the Seattle Weekly in 1976 and launched Town Hall Seattle in 1999. Other investors included former Seattle mayor Paul Schell, former Seattle City Councilman and KING-TV commentator Jim Compton, and former KING Broadcasting Company president Stimson Bullitt. =Editors= Until November 2008, the site's editor was former Weekly and Seattle Union Record editor Chuck Taylor, who was also a reporter, editor, and graphic designer at the Seattle Times. He left Crosscut during its transition to a nonprofit. For almost a year, the site was edited by Brewster alone until former Seattle Post-Intelligencer and Seattle Times editor Mark Matassa joined in September 2009. Matassa only stayed with Crosscut for three months, leaving in December to join the administration of new Seattle mayor Mike McGinn. He was replaced by his sister, former Times journalist Michele Matassa-Flores, and former P-I columnist Joe Copeland. Matassa-Flores left in the summer of 2011. Crosscut was then edited by Greg Hanscom (executive editor), Drew Atkins (managing editor), and Copeland (senior editor). Florangela Davila later came on as managing editor. Currently, Victor Hernandez serves as executive editor, Mark Baumgarten serves as managing editor, and Knute Berger is the editor-at- large. =Transition to a nonprofit= On November 17, 2008, Brewster announced that a switch to nonprofit status was being explored by Crosscut LLC, which necessitated temporary staff cuts. Brewster remained the only employee until September 2009, when grant funding finally materialized and Crosscut was able to hire an editor and support staff,http://crosscut.com/2009/11/18/crosscut/19293/Updated:-Crosscut-s-new- approach/ Updated: Crosscut's new approach including an editor, an advertising director, and eventually a Web developer.

Illustrations on blueprint carried out by Auckland City Council heritage management staff members following a soil subsidence into a cavity below the concrete blast cap The Albert Park tunnels are found largely beneath Albert Park, in central Auckland, New Zealand. The tunnels were constructed as air raid shelters during the Second World War. At the conclusion of the war they were sealed to prevent vandalism or misuse by the public, and as a protection against carbon dioxide build-up or tunnel collapse. Conception  New Zealand's involvement in the war began in 1939, and with Axis naval activity occurring in New Zealand waters, domestic defence plans were necessary, with much capital being invested. Matters became urgent with the entry of Japan into the war in 1941. A number of coastal defences were already in place throughout the country, with a concentration in Auckland, and Auckland City Council felt the need for air raid shelters in the central city, in preparation for Japanese attack. Work began in December 1941, and by January 1942, 16,300 feet of slit trenches had been dug around the city. Additional shelters were created in basements, the Domain, Grafton Gully, and the old Parnell railway tunnel. Auckland city centre had a daytime population of 70,000, but by April 1942 shelter capacity was only 20,000. Furthermore, experience in Britain during the Blitz indicated that deep shelters provided greater protection. Due to its topography and central location, Albert Park ‚Äì a communal facility built in the 1880s on the site of an 1840s army barracksClough, Rod (PhD); Albert Park Conservation/Management Plan: Archaeological Assessment, Clough & Associates, Auckland, 1996 ‚Äì was chosen as the site for a major construction. In 1942 a large complex of tunnels and shelters was established under the park, capable of sheltering 20,400 people. The tunnels were designed by city engineer James Tyler, and were estimated to cost ¬£120,000 (about ¬£6 per head), with ¬£90,000 of the cost met by the government and the rest by Auckland City. With planned shifts running twenty- four hours, the work was expected to take four to six months. Work began in February, with up to 300 men in gangs working three shifts a day six days a week, and the digging was completed in August. Carpentry and plumbing, at additional cost, was added over the following two months. The tunnels were officially opened by Mayor John Allum in October 1942. Construction and structure There are more than of tunnels, reaching from Constitution Hill to Wellesley Street, involving a network of shelters, sanitation facilities and first aid posts, all ventilated by air shafts, with a total of nine entrances. The tunnels run through sandstone and volcanic rock, and were mainly dug by hand by a team of 114 council workers, most of whom were middle-aged men who were unfit for war. The tunnels were lined with over 975 km of New Zealand native timber, including Kauri, Heart Rimu, Larch and New Zealand Stringy Bark.\\"Heritage Walks: The Engineering Heritage of Auckland\\" by Elizabeth Aitken Rose and the Auckland Engineering Heritage Committee of IPENZ. A total of 315 people were involved with this project. The central, arched access tunnels were , , and ; the grid of accommodation galleries ‚Äì totalling ‚Äì were square and provided with wooden seating. The floors were covered with scoria. The tunnel complex, unlike many other air raid shelter complexes, does not have blast doors, but instead has baffles. The baffle is a block in a tunnel constructed from wood, lead and stone to absorb the shock wave in the event of a bomb blast. The small tunnels around them allowed passage and reduced the shock with the perpendicular reflections. A diesel engine from an old meatworks powered the ventilation fans and emergency lighting, as well as a loud-speaker system.

By February 1945, without the money to upgrade or convert the tunnels to other use, plans were made to fill them in. The tunnels were filled in with 8.8 million unfired clay blocks made by Crum Brick and Tile in New Lynn. It took 15 men a total of 12 months to complete the back-filling process and the entrances were sealed and buried by 18 April 1946. Since then, a number of schemes have been proposed to make use of reopened tunnels. In the 1960s there were newspaper articles proposing ideas, and interest was renewed in the 1990s by two groups: a businessman seeking to open them as a tourism venture, and a group of architecture students with their lecturer who considered the tunnels might offer a solution to Auckland‚Äôs traffic problems.Exploration by the Intrepid Binary Brothers In 1996, the city council signed a contract with tourism promotor William Reid, giving him permission to unseal the tunnels and perform an inspection, with a view to developing a tourist attraction.\\"Albert Park Tunnels Agreement Signed\\", SCENE, 4 March 1996 Related legislation was passed in 2001.New Zealand Government Website \\"Access to Albert Park tunnels included in new legislation\\", 9 October 2001. In 2005, subsidence occurred within the park, due to the collapse of in-fill soil within the old ventilation shafts.\\"Investigation into subsidence in Albert Park\\" Wednesday, 19 October 2005, 12:56 pm Press Release: Auckland City Council Blocked entrances can be seen at the top of Victoria Street ‚Äì hidden by a decorative wall ‚Äì and the steel door present at the foot of Constitution Hill. Three other blocked entrances are located behind the Park's Gateway sculpture. As of June 2012, two Auckland residents Bill Reid and Mark Howarth, were working on plans to have the first 25m of tunnel five excavated in order to create a museum depicting its history. However, Auckland Council advised that no investigations had been carried out with regards to work required to reopen the tunnels. In January 2017, Reid was engaged in meetings with Auckland Tourism, Events and Economic Development (ATEED) and campaigning for the tunnels to be reopened as a tourist attraction and as a direct link for walkers and cyclists between Victoria St and Parnell.

In the past, linguists considered the Midland dialect to cover an even larger area, extending eastward through Pennsylvania to the Atlantic Ocean. The color blue on this map indicates the Inland North dialect, which is intruding southward into the middle of this region towards St. Louis, Missouri and Peoria, Illinois show variation between the Midland and Inland North dialects. The distinction between a North and a South Midland region is that the South Midland shows a tendency for extra features usually associated with Southern U.S. dialects: notably, strongest fronting and a glide weakening of before certain sonorant consonants. Midland American English is a regional dialect or super-dialect of American English, geographically lying between the traditionally-defined Northern and Southern United States.Labov, William; Ash, Sharon; Boberg, Charles (1997). \\"Dialects of the United States.\\" A National Map of The Regional Dialects of American English. University of Pennsylvania. The boundaries of Midland American English are not entirely clear, being revised and reduced by linguists due to definitional changes and several Midland sub-regions undergoing rapid and diverging pronunciation shifts since the early-middle 20th century onwards.: \\"The Midland does not show the homogeneous character that marks the North in Chapter 14, or defines the South in Chapter 18. Many Midland cities have developed a distinct dialect character of their own[....] Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and St Louis are quite distinct from the rest of the Midland[....]\\"Bierma, Nathan. \\"American 'Midland' has English dialect all its own.\\" Chicago Tribune. These general characteristics of the Midland regional accent are firmly established: fronting of the , , and vowels occurs towards the center or even front of the mouth; the cot‚Äìcaught merger is neither fully completed nor fully absent; and short-a tensing evidently occurs strongest before nasal consonants. The currently-documented core of the Midland dialect region spans from central Ohio at its eastern extreme to central Nebraska and Oklahoma City at its western extreme. Certain areas outside of this core also clearly demonstrate a Midland accent, including Charleston, South Carolina; the Texan cities of Abilene, Austin, and Corpus Christi; and central and southern Florida. Twentieth-century dialectology was the first to identify the \\"Midland\\" as a region lexically distinct from the Northern and Southern U.S., later even focusing on an internal division (North Midland versus South Midland); however, 21st-century studies now reveal increasing unification of the South Midland with a larger, newer Southern accent region, while much of the North Midland retains a more \\"General American\\" accent. Early 20th-century boundaries established for the Midland dialect region are being reduced or revised, since several previous sub-regions of Midland speech have since developed their own distinct dialects. Pennsylvania, the original home state of the Midland dialect, is one such area, having now formed such unique dialects as Philadelphia and Pittsburgh English. Original and former Midland The dialect region \\"Midland\\" was first labeled in the 1890s, but only first defined (tentatively) by Hans Kurath in 1949 as centered on central Pennsylvania and expanding westward and southward to include most of Pennsylvania, and the Appalachian regions of Kentucky, Tennessee, and all of West Virginia.Kurath, Hans (1949). A Word Geography of the Eastern United States. University of Michigan.) A decade later, Kurath split this into two discrete subdivisions: the \\"North Midland\\" beginning north of the Ohio River valley area and extending westward into central Indiana, central Illinois, central Ohio, Iowa, and northern Missouri, as well as parts of Nebraska and northern Kansas ; and the \\"South Midland\\", which extends south of the Ohio River and expands westward to include Kentucky, southern Indiana, southern Illinois, southern Ohio, southern Missouri, Arkansas, southern Kansas, and Oklahoma, west of the Mississippi River.Kurath, Hans; McDavid, Raven Ioor (1961).The Pronunciation of English in the Atlantic States. University of Michigan Press. Kurath and then later Craig Carver and the related Dictionary of American Regional English based their 1960s research only on lexical (vocabulary) characteristics, with Carver et al. determining the Midland non-existent according to their 1987 publication and preferring to identify Kurath's North Midland as merely an extension of the North and his South Midland as an extension of the South, based on some 800 lexical items. Conversely, William Labov and his team based their 1990s research largely on phonological (sound) characteristics and re-identified the Midland area as a buffer zone between the Inland Southern and Inland Northern accent regions. In Labov et al.'s newer study, the \\"Midland\\" essentially coincides with Kurath's \\"North Midland\\", while the \\"South Midland\\" is now considered as largely a portion, or the northern fringe, of the larger 20th- century Southern accent region. Indeed, while the lexical and grammatical isoglosses encompass the Appalachian Mountains regardless of the Ohio River, the phonological boundary fairly closely follows along the Ohio River itself. More recent research has focused on grammatical characteristics and in particular a variable, possible combination of such characteristics. The original Midland dialect region, thus, has split off into having more of a Southern accent in southern Appalachia, while, the second half of the 20th century has seen the emergence of a unique Western Pennsylvania accent in northern Appalachia (centered on Pittsburgh) as well as a unique Philadelphia accent. =Mid-Atlantic region= The dialect region of the Mid-Atlantic States‚Äîcentered on Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Baltimore, Maryland; and Wilmington, Delaware‚Äîaligns to the Midland phonological definition except that it strongly resists the cot‚Äìcaught merger and traditionally has a short-a split that is similar to New York City's, though still unique. Certain vocabulary is also specific to the Mid-Atlantic dialect, and particularly to its Philadelphia sub-dialect. =Western Pennsylvania= Based on Labov et al., averaged F1/F2 means for speakers from Western PA. The merger of and is complete for 11 out of 14 speakers; is backer and lower than in the rest of the North Midland. The emerging and expanding dialect of western and much of central Pennsylvania is, for many purposes, an extension of the South Midland; it is spoken also in Youngstown, Ohio, 10 miles west of the state line, as well as Clarksburg, West Virginia. Like the Midland proper, the Western Pennsylvania accent features fronting of and , as well as positive anymore. Its chief distinguishing features, however, also make it a separate dialect than the Midland one. These features include a completed - merger to a rounded vowel, which also causes a chain shift that drags the vowel into the previous position of . The Western Pennsylvania accent, lightheartedly known as \\"Pittsburghese\\", is perhaps best known for the monophthongization of to ( to ), such as the stereotypical Pittsburgh pronunciation of downtown as dahntahn. Despite having a Northern accent in the first half of the 20th century, Erie, Pennsylvania, is the only major Northern city to change its affiliation to Midland by now using the Western Pennsylvania accent. Phonology and phonetics Based on Labov et al.; averaged F1/F2 means for speakers from the (North) Midland (excluding Western PA and the St. Louis corridor). and are close but not merged. *Rhoticity: Midland speech is firmly rhotic (or fully r-pronouncing), like most North American English. *Cot‚Äìcaught merger in transition: The merger of the vowel sounds in and is consistently in a transitional phase throughout most of the Midland region, showing neither a full presence nor absence of the merger. This involves a vowel merger of the \\"short o\\" (as in cot or stock) and \\"aw\\" (as in caught or stalk) phonemes. **On boundary: A well-known phonological difference between Midland and Northern accents is that in the Midland, the single word on contains the phoneme (as in caught) rather than (as in cot), as in the North. For this reason, one of the names for the boundary between the dialects of the Midland and the North is the \\"on line\\". *Epenthetic R: The phoneme sequence , as in wash, squash, and Washington, traditionally receives an additional sound after the , thus with Washington sounding like \\"Warshington\\" . Likely inherited from Scots-Irish influence, this features ranges from D.C., Maryland, southern Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, Arkansas, West Texas, and the Midland dialect regions within Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Kansas.Kelly, John (2004). \\"Catching the Sound of the City\\". The Washington Post. The Washington Post Company. Studied best of all in southern Pennsylvania, this feature may be declining.Barbara Johnstone, Barbara; et al. (2015). Pittsburgh Speech and Pittsburghese. Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KGp. p. 22. *The short-a phoneme, , most commonly follows a General American (\\"continuous\\" and pre-nasal) distribution: is raised and tensed toward before nasal consonants (such as fan) but remains low in other contexts (such as fact). An increasing number of speakers from central Ohio realize the vowel as open front . *Fronting of : the phoneme (as in goat) is fronter than in many other American accents, particularly those of the North; the phoneme is frequently realized as a diphthong with a central nucleus, approximating . *Fronting of : the diphthong (as in mouth) has a fronter nucleus than , approaching . *Fronting of : among younger speakers, (as in bug, strut, what, etc.) is shifting strongly to the front: . *Lowering of : the diphthong (as in face, reign, day, etc.) often has a lower nucleus than the Northern accents just above Midland region, so that the Midland diphthong approaches . *Phonologically, the South Midland remains slightly different from the North Midland in one major respect: its greater likelihood of using a \\"glideless\\" vowel reminiscent of the Southern U.S. accent, though deletion in the South Midland only appears before sonorant consonants: . For example, fire may be pronounced something like fahr or even far. Southern Indiana is the northernmost extent of this accent, forming what dialectologists refer to as the \\"Hoosier Apex\\" of the South Midland, with the accent locally known as the \\"Hoosier Twang\\". Grammar *Positive anymore: A common feature of the greater Midland area is so-called \\"positive anymore\\": It is possible to use the adverb anymore with the meaning \\"nowadays\\" in sentences without negative polarity, such as Air travel is inconvenient anymore. *\\"Need + participle\\": Many speakers use the construction \\"need + past participle\\". Some examples include: **The car needs washed to mean the car needs to be washed **They need repaired to mean they need to be repaired **So much still needs said to mean so much still needs to be said :To a lesser degree, a small number of other verbs have been reportedly used in this way too, such as The baby likes cuddled or She wants prepared. *\\"All the + comparative\\": Speakers throughout the Midland (except central and southern Illinois and especially Iowa) may use \\"all the [comparative form of an adjective]\\" to mean \\"as [adjective] as\\", when followed by a subject. Some examples include:\\"All the Further\\". Yale Grammatical Diversity Project English in North America. Yale University. 2017. **I held all the tighter I could to mean I held as tight as I could **That was all the higher she could jump to mean That was as high as she could jump **This is all the more comfortable it gets to mean This is as comfortable as it gets *Alls: At the start of a sentence, \\"alls [subject] [verb]\\" can be used in place of \\"all that [subject] [verb]\\" to form a noun phrase followed by is or was. For example (with the entire clause in italics): \\"Alls we brought was bread\\" or \\"Alls I want to do is sing a song\\". This has been especially well-studied in southern Ohio, though it is widespread throughout the Midwest.\\"The alls construction\\". Yale Grammatical Diversity Project English in North America. Yale University. 2017. *Many other grammatical constructions are also reported to varying degrees, predominantly of Scots-Irish origin, that could hypothetically define a Midland dialect, such as: what-all (an alternative to what), wakened (an alternative to woke or woke up), sick at the stomach, quarter till (as in quarter till two to mean the time 1:45), and whenever to mean when (e.g. I cheered last Saturday whenever I won the award).

Another possible Appalachian and South Midland variant is you'uns (from you ones), though it remains most associated with Western Pennsylvania English. Charleston Today, the city of Charleston, South Carolina clearly has all the defining features of a mainstream Midland accent. The vowels and are extremely fronted, and yet not so not before . Also, the older, more traditional Charleston accent was extremely \\"non-Southern\\" in sound (as well as being highly unique), spoken throughout the South Carolina and Georgia Lowcountry, but it mostly faded out of existence in the first half of the 20th century. Cincinnati Older English speakers of Cincinnati, Ohio, have a phonological pattern quite distinct from the surrounding area (Boberg and Strassel 2000), while younger speakers now align to the general Midland accent. The older Cincinnati short-a system is unique in the Midland. While there is no evidence for a phonemic split, the phonetic conditioning of short-a in conservative Cincinnati speech is similar to and originates from that of New York City, with the raising environments including nasals (m, n, ≈ã), voiceless fricatives (f, unvoiced th, sh, s), and voiced stops (b, d, g). Weaker forms of this pattern are shown by speakers from nearby Dayton and Springfield. Boberg and Strassel (2000) reported that Cincinnati's traditional short-a system was giving way among younger speakers to a nasal system similar to those found elsewhere in the Midland and the West. St. Louis Corridor St. Louis, Missouri, is historically one among several (North) Midland cities, but it has developed some unique features of its own distinguishing it from the rest of the Midland. The area around St. Louis has been in dialectal transition throughout most of the 1900s until the present moment. The eldest generation of the area may exhibit a rapidly-declining merger of the phonemes (as in for) and (as in far) to the sound , while leaving distinct (as in four), thus being one of the few American accents to still resist the horse- hoarse merger (while also displaying the card-cord merger). This merger has led to jokes referring to \\"I farty-far\\", although a more accurate eye spelling would be \\"I farty-four\\". Also, some St. Louis speakers, again usually the oldest ones, have instead of more typical before ‚Äîthus measure is pronounced ‚Äîand wash (as well as Washington) gains an , becoming (\\"warsh\\"). Since the mid-1900s (namely, in speakers born from the 1920s to 1940s), however, a newer accent arose in a dialect \\"corridor\\" essentially following historic U.S. Route 66 in Illinois (now Interstate 55 in Illinois) from Chicago southwest to St. Louis. Speakers of this modern \\"St. Louis Corridor\\"‚Äîincluding St. Louis, Fairbury, and Springfield, Illinois‚Äîhave gradually developed more features of the Inland North dialect, best recognized today as the Chicago accent. This 20th-century St. Louis accent's separating quality from the rest of the Midland is its strong resistance to the cot‚Äìcaught merger and the most advanced development of the Northern Cities Vowel Shift (NCS). In the 20th century, Greater St. Louis therefore became a mix of Midland accents and Inland Northern (Chicago-like) accents. Even more complicated, however, there is evidence that these Northern sound changes are reversing for the younger generations of speakers in the St. Louis area, who are re-embracing purely Midland-like accent features, though only at a regional level and therefore not including the aforementioned traditional features of the eldest generation. According to a UPenn study, the St. Louis Corridor's one- generation period of embracing the NCS was followed by the next generation's \\"retreat of NCS features from Route 66 and a slight increase of NCS off of Route 66\\", in turn followed by the most recent generations' decreasing evidence of the NCS until it disappears altogether among the youngest speakers.Friedman, Lauren (2015). A Convergence of Dialects in the St. Louis Corridor. Volume 21. Issue 2. Selected Papers from New Ways of Analyzing Variation(NWAV). 43. Article 8. University of Pennsylvania. Thus, due to harboring two different dialects in the same geographic space, the \\"Corridor appears simultaneously as a single dialect area and two separate dialect areas\\".\\"Northern Cities Panel\\". 43rd NWAV. School of Literature's, Cultures, and Linguistics. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Texas Rather than a proper Southern accent, several cities in Texas can be better described as having a Midland U.S. accent, as they lack the \\"true\\" Southern accent's full deletion and the oft-accompanying Southern Vowel Shift. Texan cities classifiable as such specifically include Abilene, Austin, San Antonio and Corpus Christi. Austin, in particular, has been reported in some speakers to show the South Midland (but not the Southern) variant of deletion mentioned above.

Their teachings in the law school of Bologna were based on glosses and commentaries on the rediscovered Corpus juris civilis of Justinian. Martinus may have studied with the founder of legal scholarship in Bologna, Irnerius.Peter Landau, \\"The development of law\\" in The New Cambridge Medieval History :124f. The revived importance of Roman law, in the form of medieval Roman law, embodied by the Quattuor Doctores made its first impact in the political arena in 1158, when they gave their support to Frederick Barbarossa's Diet of Roncaglia in his conflict with the Italian communes over imperial rights in Lombardy. Of the four the strongest contrast in interpretations of the revived Roman law were Bulgarus and Martinus. Bulgarus took the law at face value and applied the narrowest interpretation, the ius strictum; Martinus, on the other hand, applied the legal principle of aequitas, \\"equity\\" or \\"equivalence\\", which permitted broad latitude in extending Roman principles to modern situations. The followers of Bulgarus, the Bulgari, held sway in Bologna in the following generation, as nostri doctores (\\"our doctors\\"), while the followers of Martinus, the Gosiani, taught particularly in southern France. The form of Questiones, questions and answers on the principles of law, rather than glosses on specific texts, was the particular contribution of Hugo.Porta Ravennata, the \\"Ravenna gate\\" of Bologna, was the location of Hugo's classrooms.

The fossils are from organisms that lived in the area nearly 50 million years ago when the area that is now the city of Republic was part of an ancient lake. The old lake's bottom layers are now volcanic ash hardened into sedimentary rock, becoming fine-grained tuffaceous shale.

Some common obligations for which tax refunds are intercepted include student loans, child support, fines, restitution, and wage garnishments; however this is usually done if said debts are in considerable arrears. Debtors who have been making agreed payments on the dot are usually not subject to this as creditors often feel interception unnecessary. While taxes are sometimes intercepted to pay off the balance to a government- operated collection agency, few jurisdictions allow refunds to be intercepted to pay a private collection agency. In the United States, the Internal Revenue Code allows the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to divert overpayments of taxes to satisfy other federal taxes,Internal Revenue Code section 6402(a). certain past-due support obligations,Section 6402(c). debts owed to other Federal agencies,Section 6402(d). state income tax obligations,Section 6402(e)., county taxes, local taxes and unemployment compensation debts.Section 6402(f). Unlike private debts, refund interception for the said taxation will often occur even if prompt prior payments were made. In many cases, the Department of Revenue (DOR) has the authority to intercept state tax refunds or refundable credits to repay debts owed to government agencies. Tax refunds may be intercepted to repay debts that are owed to the DOR, child support debts, court ordered restitution debts, debts owed to state or local governments, debts owed to the IRS or federal government, or debts owed across states. If one disagrees with the interception of their refund, then contacting the DOR is the best way to dispute the interception. https://www.revenue.wi.gov/Pages/faqs/ise-refintcp.aspx Tax refunds are intercepted with the purpose of forcing citizens to comply to their required debts. If one has student loan payments, child support payments, or worker's compensation payments that they have not fulfilled, then their refund will be intercepted and put towards the payments of those obligations. https://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2011/chapter7/article2C/section7-2C-2/ In order for a debt to be permitted for interception it must: Be a debt greater than or equal to $100 in value. Be owed to a claimant agency that is legally obliged or contractually obligated to collect said debt. Be owed through contract, tort, or some other operation of the law. https://law.justia.com/codes/new-mexico/2011/chapter7/article2C/section7-2C-3/ When a tax refund has been intercepted, the debtor will receive a notice from the treasury departments Financial Management Service (FMS) that the interception has occurred. This notice will contain information on the original tax refund amount and how much was offset in the interception. It will also contain information on what agency is intercepting the refund along with information on how to contact that agency. https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/six-facts-on-tax-refunds-and-offsets In cases where one feels that their tax refund has been wrongfully intercepted, there are some options for the interception to be appealed. For example, if one has divorced their spouse then the debt is no longer theirs to pay and a copy of your divorce paperwork should be sent to the intercepting agency. In cases where there are disputes, but no direct paperwork to prove ones cause, then it is best to contact the internal revenue service or the other collecting agency directly. There are other miscellaneous sources of income that are subject to interception. For example lottery winnings and state issued vendor payments may be intercepted if they are over a certain amount of money.

Web typography refers to the use of fonts on the World Wide Web. When HTML was first created, font faces and styles were controlled exclusively by the settings of each web browser. There was no mechanism for individual Web pages to control font display until Netscape introduced the \`font\` element in 1995, which was then standardized in the HTML 3.2 specification. However, the font specified by the \`font\` element had to be installed on the user's computer or a fallback font, such as a browser's default sans-serif or monospace font, would be used. The first Cascading Style Sheets specification was published in 1996 and provided the same capabilities. The CSS2 specification was released in 1998 and attempted to improve the font selection process by adding font matching, synthesis and download. These techniques did not gain much use, and were removed in the CSS2.1 specification. However, Internet Explorer added support for the font downloading feature in version 4.0, released in 1997. Font downloading was later included in the CSS3 fonts module, and has since been implemented in Safari 3.1, Opera 10 and Mozilla Firefox 3.5. This has subsequently increased interest in Web typography, as well as the use of font downloading. CSS1 In the first CSS specification, authors specified font characteristics via a series of properties: * font-family * font-style * font-variant * font-weight * font-size All fonts were identified solely by name. Beyond the properties mentioned above, designers had no way to style fonts, and no mechanism existed to select fonts not present on the client system. =Web-safe fonts= Web- safe fonts are fonts likely to be present on a wide range of computer systems, and used by Web content authors to increase the likelihood that content displays in their chosen font. If a visitor to a Web site does not have the specified font, their browser tries to select a similar alternative, based on the author-specified fallback fonts and generic families or it uses font substitution defined in the visitor's operating system. =Microsoft's Core fonts for the Web= Since being released under Microsoft's Core fonts for the Web program, Arial, Georgia, and Verdana have become three de facto fonts of the Web. To ensure that all Web users had a basic set of fonts, Microsoft started the Core fonts for the Web initiative in 1996 (terminated in 2002). Released fonts include Arial, Courier New, Times New Roman, Comic Sans, Impact, Georgia, Trebuchet, Webdings and Verdana‚Äîunder an EULA that made them freely distributable but also limited some rights to their use. Their high penetration rate has made them a staple for Web designers. However, most Linux distributions don't include these fonts by default. CSS2 attempted to increase the tools available to Web developers by adding font synthesis, improved font matching and the ability to download remote fonts. Some CSS2 font properties were removed from CSS2.1 and later included in CSS3. =Fallback fonts= The CSS specification allows for multiple fonts to be listed as fallback fonts. In CSS, the \`font-family\` property accepts a list of comma-separated font faces to use, like so: font-family: \\"Nimbus Sans L\\", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; The first font specified is the preferred font. If this font is not available, the Web browser attempts to use the next font in the list. If none of the fonts specified are found, the browser displays its default font. This same process also happens on a per-character basis if the browser tries to display a character not present in the specified font. =Generic font families= To give Web designers some control over the appearance of fonts on their Web pages, even when the specified fonts are not available, the CSS specification allows the use of several generic font families. These families are designed to split fonts into several categories based on their general appearance. They are commonly specified as the last in a series of fallback fonts, as a last resort in the event that none of the fonts specified by the author are available. For several years, there were five generic families: Sans-serif : Fonts that do not have decorative markings, or serifs, on their letters. These fonts are often considered easier to read on screens. Serif : Fonts that have decorative markings, or serifs, present on their characters. These fonts are traditionally used in printed books. Monospace : Fonts in which all characters are equally wide. Cursive : Fonts that resemble cursive writing. These fonts may have a decorative appearance, but they can be difficult to read at small sizes, so they are generally used sparingly. Fantasy : Fonts that may contain symbols or other decorative properties, but still represent the specified character. CSS 4 introduces several new options: System-ui : Default fonts on a given system: the purpose of this option is to allow web content to integrate with the look and feel of the native OS. ui-serif : Default fonts on a given system in a serif style ui-sans-serif : Default fonts on a given system in a sans-serif style ui-monospace : Default fonts on a given system in a monospace style ui-rounded : Default fonts on a given system in a rounded style Emoji :Fonts using emoji Math :Fonts for complex mathematical formula and expressions. Fangsong () :Chinese typefaces that are between serif Song and cursive Kai forms. This style is often used for government documents. Web fonts =History= A technique to refer to and automatically download remote fonts was first specified in the CSS2 specification, which introduced the @font-face construct. At the time, fetching font files from the web was controversial because fonts meant to be used only for certain web pages could also be downloaded and installed in breach of the font license. Microsoft first added support for downloadable EOT fonts in Internet Explorer 4 in 1997. Authors had to use the proprietary WEFT tool to create a subsetted font file for each page. EOT showed that webfonts could work and the format saw some use in writing systems not supported by common operating systems. However, the format never gained widespread acceptance and was ultimately rejected by W3C.W3C team comment In 2006, H√•kon Wium Lie started a campaign against using EOT and rather have web browsers support commonly used font formats.Microsoft's forgotten monopolyWeb fonts: the view from the free worldCSS @ Ten: The Next Big Thing Support for the commonly used TrueType and OpenType font formats has since been implemented in Safari 3.1, Opera 10, Mozilla Firefox 3.5 and Internet Explorer 9. In 2010, the WOFF compression method for TrueType and OpenType fonts was submitted to W3C by the Mozilla Foundation, Opera Software and Microsoft, and browsers have since added support.WOFF File Format 1.0 Submission Request to W3C Google Fonts was launched in 2010 to serve webfonts under open-source licenses. By 2016, more than 800 webfont families are available. Webfonts have become an important tool for web designers and as of 2016 a majority of sites use webfonts.Richard Fink (2016-09-06)Webfonts on the Prairie, Alist Apart =File formats= By using a specific CSS @font-face embedding technique it is possible to embed fonts such that they work with IE4+, Firefox 3.5+, Safari 3.1+, Opera 10+ and Chrome 4.0+. This allows the vast majority of Web users to access this functionality. Some commercial foundries object to the redistribution of their fonts. For example, Hoefler & Frere-Jones says that, while they \\"...enthusiastically [support] the emergence of a more expressive Web in which designers can safely and reliably use high-quality fonts online,\\" the current delivery of fonts using @font-face is considered \\"illegal distribution\\" by the foundry and is not permitted. Instead, Hoefler & Co. offer a proprietary font delivery system rooted in the cloud. Many other commercial type foundries address the redistribution of their fonts by offering a specific license, known as a web font license, which permits the use of the font software to display content on the web, a use normally prohibited by basic desktop licenses. Naturally this does not interfere with fonts and foundries under free licences.See Open-source typefaces and Free software Unicode typefaces listings for such fonts. TrueDoc TrueDoc, while not specifically a webfont specification, was the first standard for embedding fonts. It was developed by the type foundry Bitstream in 1994, and became natively supported in Netscape Navigator 4, in 1996. Due to open source license restrictions, with Netscape unable to release Bitstream's source code, native support for the technology ended when Netscape Navigator 6 was released. An ActiveX plugin was available to add support for TrueDoc to Internet Explorer, but the technology had to compete against Microsoft's Embedded OpenType fonts, which had natively supported in their Internet Explorer browser since version 4.0. Another impediment was the lack of open-source or free tool to create webfonts in TrueDoc format, whereas Microsoft made available a free Web Embedding Fonts Tool to create webfonts in their format. Embedded OpenType Internet Explorer has supported font embedding through the proprietary Embedded OpenType standard since version 4.0. It uses digital rights management techniques to help prevent fonts from being copied and used without a license. A simplified subset of EOT has been formalized under the name of CWT (Compatibility Web Type, formerly EOT-Lite) Scalable Vector Graphics Web typography applies to SVG in two ways: #All versions of the SVG 1.1 specification, including the SVGT subset, define a font module allowing the creation of fonts within an SVG document. Safari introduced support for many of these properties in version 3. Opera added preliminary support in version 8.0, with support for more properties in 9.0. #The SVG specification lets CSS apply to SVG documents in a similar manner to HTML documents, and the @font- face rule can be applied to text in SVG documents. Opera added support for this in version 10, and WebKit since version 325 also supports this method using SVG fonts only. Scalable Vector Graphics Fonts SVG fonts was a W3C standard of fonts using SVG graphic that became a subset of OpenType fonts. It allowed multicolor or animated fonts. It was first a subset of SVG 1.1 specifications but it has been deprecated in the SVG 2.0 specification. The SVG fonts as independent format is supported by most browsers apart from IE and Firefox, and is deprecated in Chrome (and Chromium). That's now generally deprecated; the standard that most browser vendor agreed with is SVG font subset included in OpenType (and then WOFF superset, see below), called SVGOpenTypeFonts. Firefox has supported SVG OpenType since Firefox 26. TrueType/OpenType Linking to industry-standard TrueType (TTF) and OpenType (TTF/OTF) fonts is supported by Mozilla Firefox 3.5+, Opera 10+, Safari 3.1+, and Google Chrome 4.0+. Internet Explorer 9+ supports only those fonts with embedding permissions set to installable. Web Open Font Format The Web Open Font Format (WOFF) is essentially OpenType or TrueType with compression and additional metadata. WOFF is supported by Mozilla Firefox 3.6+, Google Chrome 5+, Opera Presto, and is supported by Internet Explorer 9 (since March 14, 2011). Support is available on Mac OS X Lion's Safari from release 5.1. Unicode fonts Only two fonts available by default on the Windows platform, Microsoft Sans Serif and Lucida Sans Unicode, provide a wide Unicode character repertoire. A bug in Verdana (and the different handling of it by various user agents) hinders its usability where combining characters are desired. On free and open-source software platforms such as Linux, GNU Unifont and GNU FreeFont provide a wide range of Unicode character. Alternatives A common hurdle in Web design is the design of mockups that include fonts that are not Web-safe. There are a number of solutions for situations like this. One common solution is to replace the text with a similar Web-safe font or use a series of similar-looking fallback fonts. Another technique is image replacement. This practice involves overlaying text with an image containing the same text written in the desired font. This is good for aesthetic purposes, but prevents text selection, increases bandwidth use, is bad for search engine optimization, and makes the text inaccessible for users with disabilities. Also common is the use of Flash-based solutions such as sIFR. This is similar to image replacement techniques, though the text is selectable and rendered as a vector. However, this method requires the presence of a proprietary plugin on a client's system. Another solution is using Javascript to replace the text with VML (for Internet Explorer) or SVG (for all other browsers).About Cufon Font hosting services allow users to pay a subscription to host non-Web-safe fonts online. Most services host the font for the user and provide the necessary @font-face CSS declaration. An example of a CSS @font-face setup: @font-face { font-family: 'Journal'; src: url('http://your-own.site/fonts/journal/journal.woff') format('woff'), url('http://your-own.site/fonts/journal/journal.svg#Journal') format('svg'), url('http://your-own.site/fonts/journal/journal.ttf') format('truetype'), url('http://your-own.site/fonts/journal/journal.eot'), url('http://your- own.site/fonts/journal/journal.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'); font- weight: normal; font-style: normal; } Practical considerations In practice, it matters not only what web browser the audience is using but also how their operating system is configured. In 2010, type designer and consultant Thomas Phinney (Vice President of FontLab and formerly with Adobehttp://www.adobe.com/products/type/font-designers/thomas-phinney.html) wrote a step-by-step process for finding the best rendering solution, which‚Äîmore or less jokingly‚Äîuses a large number of goto statements.Thomas Phinney (October 13, 2010) Font rendering in web browsers: a find-your-font adventure A more visually oriented flow chart was posted in the same year on the Typophile forum by Miha Zajec. as cited by Phinney Internet Archive link See also * Scalable Inman Flash Replacement * List of RFC as mentioned in WOFF (draft of 2009-10-23): ** RFC 1950 ZLIB Compressed Data Format Specification ** RFC 2119 Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels ** RFC 4647 Matching of Language Tags Notes References External links * W3C CSS Fonts Specification * Typoscan is a designer tool helping you to scan the typography of any website in less than a second.

M. Stirling, the fourth novel in the alternate history series The Domination. The novel was released in the United States on January 1, 1996. Plot introduction Set centuries since the last war between the Domination and the Alliance, the Domination has conquered the Earth and the solar system, while the Alliance survivors have fled to the Alpha-Centauri star system where they have started a new civilization called the United States of Samothrace. The two societies have traded technology and skirmished some, focusing most of their efforts on colonizing all new habitable worlds they discover. Space combat has been rare since faster-than-light (FTL) travel formerly has been impossible. Combat only occurred when colonists from both sides reached the same world, an incident that happened only once. (Stirling later said the Samothracians won due to their superior ship.DragonCon 2009 Q&A;) The Draka continued their enslaving any new intelligent species they discover, using genetic engineering to produce a meek and submissive version of it. Plot The book starts in 2442 A.D. somewhere in North America - thinly inhabited and with scattered remnants of the Americans having been quite literally bombed into the Stone Age - where Gwendolyn Ingolfson is ending a camping and hunting trip. On her way back to the civilization she contacts legate Tamirindus Rohm, who sends her to the Reichart Station to oversee the creation of a wormhole generator. During a test of the generator an error occurs and before she can get clear she is caught by the wormhole and is sent to an alternate Earth, called Earth/2. The event is detected by the USSNF President Douglas, which is an FTL starship of the United States of Samothrace utilizing wormhole technology and is positioned a tenth of a lightyear outside Pluto. Gwendolyn lands in a warehouse where a drug deal is taking place between 22 persons. They notice her and try to kill her, but she kills all of them instead and steals their money. Detective Henry Carmaggio arrives later on the crime scene where he learns that most of the victims died from blunt trauma or as a result of cutting blows from a bladed weapon honed to an unnatural sharpness. They also find an arm that does not belong to any of the victims and appears to be from an animal. Meanwhile, Gwendolyn tries to figure out where she has ended up and learns that she is in New York City in 1995. She quickly learns that not only did she travel back in time but also to a parallel Earth, one where the Domination of Draka never existed. She hides out for a while in various apartments, after killing the owners. Carmaggio is constantly one step behind and during his interviews with the victims‚Äô acquaintances he meets Jennifer Feinberg. Gwendolyn decides that she needs to figure out a way to contact her Earth. In an effort to make her stolen drug money look legitimate she decides to go to Cali, Colombia where she recruits her first followers. Gwendolyn also starts a company named IngolfTech to use as a front to sell high technology to raise the capital necessary to build the equipment necessary to contact her Earth. During the same time Kenneth Lafarge comes to Earth/2, ending up in a cornfield somewhere in Illinois. He starts with trying to contact the CIA, explaining why he's there and who Gwendolyn is, but everyone thinks he's insane and he is forced to fight his way out. However, this makes Carmaggio look deeper into Gwendolyn and her business, but he still can't do much. At the same time he and Jennifer Feinberg start to develop a relationship. Jennifer follows her boss and a few other co-workers down to the Bahamas where IngolfTech's headquarters is located. Lafarge learns about Gwendolyn's location and also travels there, attempting a sneak attack on her headquarters. He is forced to retreat, however, when he is unable to fight off both the security and Gwendolyn herself. Lafarge returns to New York and contact Carmaggio and explains everything to him. Carmaggio agrees to help him stop Gwendolyn and recruits some of his colleagues as well. Lafarge provides them with a small number of plasma rifles he has built with local technology. Gwendolyn returns to New York and buys the warehouse where she first came to Earth/2 and the area around it. She intends to open up a wormhole there and let through large numbers of soldiers to take over Earth/2. During a brief contact with Earth/1, she learns the Samothracians attacked Earth but were beaten back \\"only just.\\" Both Carmaggio and Lafarge decide that this is their best and only chance they have to stop Gwendolyn. They attack the warehouse and fight Gwendolyn and her security forces. Lafarge and Gwendolyn battle, damaging the wormhole generator and making it explode. Only Carmaggio and Jennifer survive. Afterwards Carmaggio and Jennifer take over IngolfTech, thanks to Lafarge hacking Gwen's records and creating a fake will. At the same time, two of Gwendolyn's followers are traveling under the sea in a secret submarine and with them a cloned baby of Gwendolyn. Main characters *Detective Lieutenant Henry Carmaggio: The main protagonist of the story, he is a detective at the NYPD whose investigation of Gwen's first murder leads him into doing everything in his power to prevent Gwen from conquering the Earth. After Gwen's death he becomes the owner of IngolfTech and decides to sell the advanced technology brought to this Earth by Gwen. *Gwendolyn Ingolfsson: A genetically engineered Draka and the main antagonist, she is accidentally sent to Earth/2 when supervising construction of a wormhole generator. She tries to recontact her Earth to bring about the conquest of Earth/2. *Kenneth Lafarge: A Samothrace agent, sent to Earth/2 to stop Gwendolyn, teams up with Henry Carmiggio. Distant relative to Chantal Lefarge (Under the Yoke) and Frederick and Marya Lefarge (The Stone Dogs) *Jennifer Feinberg: Girlfriend of one of Gwendolyn's victims, she later starts to have feelings for Henry Carmiggio and the two marry at the end of the novel. Postscript A framing device included in the collected edition, The Domination, is set several years after the events of Drakon. By that time Caramaggio is the wealthiest man in the world and is living in an orbital habitat. In the story he introduces a young scientist in his employ to the company's real secret: that they are reverse engineering technology instead of making new discoveries and that he hopes to allow them to advance Earth technology to be able to stave off a Draka attack. Film adaptation In a 2002 interview, Stirling said that out of all of his novels, Drakon would make the best movie and he would want James Cameron to be director. No information has been released on whether Drakon has been optioned, however.

Prior to the Gulf War, Kuwait was the only \\"pro- Soviet\\" state in the Persian Gulf region. Kuwait acted as a conduit for the Soviets to the other Gulf states and Kuwait was used to demonstrate the benefits of a pro-Soviet stance. Background =Russian Empire relations= In the beginning of the 20th century, the Russian Empire sought to expand its international presence by creating new spheres of influence, and the Empire looked to the Arab world. Russian interest in the region was twofold. Inroads were made by the Empire in Persia, and there was increasing rivalry between the French and British in the region. Britain had suffered major setbacks in the Boer War, and its colonial rivals sought to capitalise upon the position of the British which was increasingly undermined in the region. The Russians were also further motivated to increase their presence in the region, as both the Russians and Arabs shared a common hostility towards the Ottoman Empire. At the same time, the German Empire was planning to build a railway which would ultimately link Baghdad with Berlin, which was planned to terminate in Kuwait. In 1899 the German cruiser Arkona appeared in the Persian Gulf, which was mistaken by the British to be a Russian warship. Upon hearing of this, the Russian envoy to Tehran made a recommendation that the Empire should send a warship to the Persian Gulf. Tsar Nicholas II approved the decision to send the gunboat Gilyak. Vladimir Lambsdorff, the Russian Foreign Minister, wrote to Pyotr Tyrtov, the head of the Ministry of the Navy explaining that the purpose of sending the Gilyak was to show the British and local authorities that by flying the Russian flag in the Persian Gulf, the Empire regards the Persian Gulf as being open to vessels of all nations, and that there was no aggressive intent nor plans for terrorial acquisitions. When the Gilyak arrived in Kuwait in February 1900, the British attempted to stop the Emir of Kuwait, Mubarak Al-Sabah, from meeting the Russians, but he did travel from the desert to greet the Russians, whom he saw as an ally against Britain. Extensive discussions with the Russians led to Mubarak in the spring of 1901 asking for Russian protection; only 2 years after he had agreed to become a British protectorate, although Russian sources indicate that the request was turned down to avoid antagonising the British. In April 1900 the Russians had plans to open a regular steamship line between Odessa and ports in the Persian Gulf, leading them to open consulates in Basra and Bushehr. The protected cruiser Varyag sailed into Kuwait on 8 December 1901, and Jabir bin Mubarak, the son of the Emir, boarded the vessel to greet the visitors. The Emir was in Jahra preparing for an expected Wahabi attack, and the ship's officers were taken to Jahra, where they were warmly met by the Emir and were informed that he would turn to Russia for help if Kuwait were to be in danger, and that the Emir would like to see as many Russian ships in Kuwait as possible. The visit of the Varyag was a success, and the Russians left the Persian Gulf leaving the impression of naval superiority over their British rivals. After the visit of the Varyag, the next Russian to have an audience with the Emir was N.V. Bogoyavlensky, a zoologist, who was engaging in research in the region for the Society of Lovers of Natural Science, Anthropology and Ethnography of Moscow University. Upon meeting the Russian, the Emir was reported as telling the zoologist, \\"I believe the Russians are friends. I am happy to play host to them. I am always ready to do everything I can for them.\\" On 1 December 1902, the protected cruiser Askold sailed into Kuwait, and was met by Jabir bin Mubarak and his son Ahmad. The Russians noted that whilst the Ottoman flag flew in front of their palaces, the Sheikh did not recognise the Sultan's authority and paid him no tribute. The Boyarin arrived in Kuwait on 20‚Äì23 February 1903, along with the French cruiser Infernet. The purpose of the joint visit was to demonstrate to the British the unity and power of the French‚ÄìRussian alliance, although the French feared a Russian presence in the Persian Gulf, which was evident by their refusal to allow the Russians to utilise their coal-bunkering station in Muscat. This led to the Russians wanting to establish such a facility in Kuwait, however, by the end of 1903, Russian attention turned away from the Persian Gulf towards events in the Far East which eventually led to the Russo-Japanese War. =Soviet-era relations= Kuwait gained independence from the United Kingdom on 19 June 1961, and applied for membership of the United Nations. The Soviet Union vetoed the admission of the newly independent State on 7 July 1961. Kuwait again applied for membership in November 1961, and again the Soviets vetoed the admission of the country in the United Nations Security Council, based on an argument that Kuwait was not yet fit to be seen as an independent State, and also due to their opinion that the 1961 treaty with the United Kingdom submitted the Persian Gulf state to foreign political influence. The Soviet attitude towards Kuwait was ultimately guided by its cordial relations with Iraq, which had long held territorial ambitions towards Kuwait. When the Iraqi leader Abd al-Karim Qasim was overthrown in a coup d'√©tat on 8 February 1963, Moscow's relations with Baghdad deteroriated, leading to a warmer attitude towards Kuwait. This led to the two countries establishing diplomatic relations on 11 March 1963. Kuwait saw the establishment of relations as an insurance policy, of sorts, against new Iraqi territorial ambitions, and Russia saw the relationship as a bridge between the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean. In the years that followed, relations between the Soviet Union and Kuwait were not always cordial, which was exemplified by Premier of the Soviet Union Nikita Khrushchev making disparaging remarks towards the Kuwaiti leadership whilst on a state visit to Egypt in March 1964. Relations began to improve when Leonid Brezhnev became the Soviet leader in October 1964; however, in the 1973 Kuwait‚ÄìIraq Sanita border skirmish, Russia favored Iraq over Kuwait. In the latter part of the 1970s, relations became more cordial. The Soviets supported the Kuwaiti's nationalisation of its oil industry, and the two countries shared similar views on foreign policy issues, in particular in relation to the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict. Kuwait appreciated Soviet support for the Palestinians, and after the outbreak of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, the country began to support Soviet proposals in the Persian Gulf after recognising that the Soviet presence in the Persian Gulf was of a stabilising nature, and also as Moscow acted as a guarantor against Iraqi or Iranian aggression. This led to Kuwait actively lobbying members of the Gulf Cooperation Council to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviets, ending the diplomatic isolation of the superpower amongst the countries on the Arabian Peninsula; for most of the Cold War, Kuwait was one of only two countries which maintained such relations with the Soviet Union. Prior to the Gulf War, Kuwait was the only \\"pro-Soviet\\" Persian Gulf state. Kuwait acted as a conduit for the Soviets to the other Gulf states and Kuwait was used to demonstrate the benefits of a pro-Soviet stance. In 1987, after U.S.A refused to supply Stingers, Kuwait signed a 327 million dollar deal with Soviet Union for the purchase of surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles, tanks and other military equipment. Reportedly, Soviet experts would assemble and operate military equipment and train Kuwaiti personnel. After the August 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Iraqi forces, due to Iraqi demands, the Soviet Union evacuated its embassy in Kuwait. A spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry noted that the embassy, under international law, was still open, albeit vacant, and that the evacuation of the 882 Soviets in Kuwait did not alter the Soviet stance on the illegality of the Iraqi invasion. The President of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev explained that the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait had created an \\"extraordinary and extremely dangerous\\" situation in Persian Gulf. Furthermore, Gorbachev warned Iraqi President Saddam Hussein that refusal to abide by United Nations Security Council resolutions would see the Council introducing further measures against Iraq. Russian Federation relations =Diplomatic ties= Embassy of Kuwait in Moscow. On 28 December 1991, Kuwait recognised the Russian Federation as the successor state to the Soviet Union. Russia has an embassy in Kuwait City, and Kuwait has an embassy in Moscow. The current Ambassador of Russia to Kuwait is Mr Alexey Solomatin. The current Ambassador of Kuwait to Russia is Abdulaziz A. AladwaniPhotos who presented his credentials to Vladimir Putin on 16 January 2014. =Political ties= In 1991 the Kuwait Foreign Trading Contracting & Investment Co. extended Vnesheconombank a loan of US$1 billion on a seven-year term. On 30 May 2006, the Russian and Kuwaiti governments agreed to settle the US$1.6 billion debt of the former Soviet Union, with the repayments to take the form of US$1 billion in cash, and US$600 million in goods. =Military ties= On 29 November 1993, Kuwait became the first Persian Gulf Arab state to sign a military agreement with Russia, which followed joint naval exercises at the end of 1992. In May 1994, Pavel Grachev, the Russian Minister of Defence announced that Kuwait had signed an agreement for the delivery of a number of BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicles and S-300V surface-to-air missiles. Kuwait was the first Gulf Arab state to sign a military agreement with Russia. In recent years, Russia has established extensive military cooperation with Kuwait. =Economic ties= Speaking at the 2009 Saint Petersburg International Economic Forum, Ahmed Rashid Al Harun, the Kuwaiti Minister of Trade and Industry, noted that relations between the two countries extended over 100 years, and called for the intensification of investment between both countries. Trade statistics In 1998 bilateral trade between Russia and Kuwait amounted to US$400,000, and by the period JanuaryOctober 2005 this figure had increased to US$22.2 million.

Originally completed by Merritt Savings and Loan in 1986 and later re-opened under state management in 1992, the building rises 37 floors and in height. Office space constitutes the lower 29 floors, housing more than 1,100 employees in 14 state agencies. The nine upper floors are unoccupied, containing a maintenance area, cement staircase, a ladder to the rooftop deck and then an eighth-floor spiral staircase leading to the top of the spire and the flagpole. The flagpole atop the building reaches to , higher than any building in the state. The flags flown from the tower's poles are (by order of former Governor Martin O'Malley) a large and noticeable Star-Spangled Banner flag (a recreation of that flown over Fort McHenry during the War of 1812); and a smaller Maryland state flag. Both are usually clearly visible throughout the downtown area and most of the city. The iconic building was renamed for William Donald Schaefer (1921‚Äì2011), who served as the Mayor of Baltimore (1971‚Äì1987), Governor of Maryland (1987‚Äì1995), and state comptroller (1999‚Äì2007). History The Merritt Commercial Savings and Loan Association, originally from Merritt Boulevard in the southeast Baltimore County suburban area of Dundalk, was one of several savings and loan associations (S&Ls) which had experienced rapid growth in deposits in the late 1970s and early 1980s. To invest a portion of this capital and increase its prestige, Merritt S&L constructed the Merritt Tower to replace its small brick offices on the west side of St. Paul Street just above East Baltimore Street. The new building would also overshadow the headquarters of rival Baltimore Federal S&L, a recreated Georgian/Federal-style building known as \\"Colonial Corner\\" which had dominated St. Paul Street since the 1950s, and the headquarters of many of the traditional larger banks and insurance companies which had dominated the city's skyline since the Great Baltimore Fire of 1904. The Merritt Association went bankrupt along with several other major S&Ls in the metropolitan area during the aftermath of the Old Court Savings and Loans financial embezzlement scandals, following a run on its deposits in 1985. The Merritt Tower was sold at auction for US$30 million. After a succession of owners, the Maryland state Department of General Services purchased the building from Chemical Bank of New York for US$12.2 million, which was less than half of the building's estimated cost, and eventually planned to use it for supplemental center-city state offices in addition to the long-time \\"State Office Building Complex\\" (formerly known as the Mount Royal Plaza). It was renamed for William Donald Schaefer who served as city mayor (1971‚Äì1987) and state governor (1987‚Äì1995). Building characteristics The building was an immediate landmark for its scale and copper-colored metal-clad roof. The upper floors were designed as a loft apartment with a huge palladian window overlooking the inner harbor. It was to be a \\"shag pad\\" for the personal and private use of the developer (the president of Merritt S&L). The floor in front of the window had been scheduled to have a hot tub installed and the upper mezzanine-style half-floors on the left and right sides of the space were to be bedroom areas for his personal entertainment. the now-finished floor is a conference room for the Maryland Transit Administration.\\"What's atop the Schaefer Tower in Baltimore?\\" The Baltimore Daily Record.

It was the first U.S. mill to produce and market patent flour, and its \\"Dundas Straight\\" was once considered the best flour in the country. The Archibald Mill is associated with the introduction of hard spring wheat to Minnesota, and was one of the nation's first outfits to convert fully into a roller mill. The site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for its national significance in commerce, industry, and flour milling. Today only the foundation of the 1857 mill remains, while the ruins of the 1870 mill stand on the river's edge near a trailhead for the Mill Towns Trail.  History  The first mill in Dundas was built by cousins John Sidney (J.S.) Archibald and George Archibald on the east bank of the Cannon River in late 1857. At the time, the Cannon River had only one channel in Dundas and an 1860 flood caused a split, routing water further east of the mill and creating an island, which still exists today. Across the river was a sawmill, built in 1856 and purchased by the Archibalds for use in constructing their mill. Wooden dams on both channels controlled water flow. The mill used the most current technology available and produced flour of a fine quality. Called EXTRA, the flour was sold for $1 or $2 more per barrel than other local flours. A second mill was built in 1870 on the west bank of the west channel. In 1879 the original mill was completely remodeled. A Hungarian roller system was added and it produced better quality flour at an increased rate. On December 31, 1892, both mills caught fire and burned. The Archibalds sold the site to the owners of the local grain elevator, who rebuilt the mills. A rebuilt mill burned on November 19, 1914. The monetary loss of the fire was $30,000, partially covered by insurance. After the 1914 fire, the Archibald Mill was rebuilt for the final time and later partially destroyed in the early 1930s.

History A possible reason behind Deir al-Dubban's name is that its ancient inhabitants worshiped Ba'l Zabub (\\"Lord of the Flies\\"), a chief Canaanite deity in the region. Moshe Sharon, professor of early Islamic history at Hebrew University, has examined the inscriptions in the caves of Deir al-Dubban. He dates them from early 8th century C.E. to early 10th century C.E. =Ottoman era= The village was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, and in 1596 it appeared in the tax registers as being in the Nahiya (\\"Subdistrict\\") of Al-Quds of the Liwa (\\"District\\") of Al-Quds, with a population 72 Muslim households, an estimated 396 persons.

Incumbent president Nursultan Nazarbayev won the election with over 80% of the vote, and was sworn into office on 20 January 1999. Most observers viewed the election as blatantly unfair, further confirming that Nazarbayev was not interested in promoting a democratic system of government.Olcott, p119 Voter turnout was reported to be 87.0%.Dieter Nohlen, Florian Grotz & Christof Hartmann (2001) Elections in Asia: A data handbook, Volume I, p424 Background Kazakhstan's second presidential election was originally scheduled to occur in 1996. However, after a 1995 referendum the date was then set to be in December 2000. Parliamentary action in the fall of 1998, however, ultimately resulted in the election occurring in early 1999. On 7 October 1998, nineteen amendments to the constitution were passed by Parliament and signed into law by President Nazarbayev. One amendment to article 94 read: \\"By consent of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan the present term of the powers of the President of the Republic may be reduced by resolution of the Parliament of the Republic, adopted at the joint session of its Chambers by the majority of votes of the total number of deputies of each Chamber. In such case the Majilis of the Parliament within one month shall order elections of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan.\\"Constitution of Kazakhstan Legislation Online Acting under this new amendment, the following day Parliament asked Nazarbayev to shorten his current term in office. The president agreed, after which the Majilis set 10 January 1999 as the date for new elections.OSCE-ODIHR, p7 The main opposition candidate, Akezhan Kazhegeldin, was barred from running in the election, a move criticized by many observers. A recently passed law prohibited anyone convicted of a crime from running in the election. Kazhegeldin had recently been convicted of participating in an unsanctioned election rally, thereby becoming ineligible to seek office. Conduct Even before the election, groups such as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) expressed concern about the short preparation and campaigning period. OSCE pressed the Kazakh government to postpone the election so that all candidates could have adequate time to campaign, but to no avail.OSCE-ODIHR, p3 American Vice President Al Gore called Nazarbayev in November 1998 to express concerns about the upcoming election. The lack of fair access to mass media also concerned many observers.

History  The origins of the site go back to about 920. The first monastic settlement at Steinfeld took place in about 1070, and the Premonstratensians settled here in 1130. It became an important monastery in the German Empire, and established a number of daughter houses across Europe, including Strahov Abbey in Prague. It was raised to the status of an abbey in 1184. In 1802, Steinfeld Abbey was secularised. The basilica was put to use as a parish church, while the conventual buildings were used for a number of secular purposes until 1923, when the Salvatorians acquired them.  Basilica  Steinfeld Basilica The basilica, formerly the abbey church, was built between 1142 and 1150 by the Premonstratensians as one of the earliest vaulted churches in Germany. The present structure includes features from a number of periods and styles, from the original Romanesque style through Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque up to modern stainless steel elements. The church received the status of a papal basilica minor in 1960. It comprises altogether eight bays and six chapels, including Saint Stephen's Chapel and Saint Ursula's Chapel. Tomb of Hermann Joseph (note the apple), with the K√∂nig-Orgel in the background The basilica contains the tomb of Hermann Joseph of Steinfeld, a popular Premonstratensian saint, situated in the middle of the church and covered with a slab and a recumbent figure of alabaster, carved in 1732. This has become a pilgrimage destination. By custom apples are left here, in reference to a legend that Hermann once offered an apple to the Christ Child in the arms of the Madonna in the church of St. Maria im Kapitol at Cologne - who took it.  King Organ  The basilica also contains the well-known K√∂nig-Orgel (\\"King Organ\\"), one of the most significant church organs of the Rhineland Baroque period. It was built around 1600, with additions in 1680, 1727 and 1934. It was taken out of service in 1977. In 1981, the organ was thoroughly restored by the firm Josef Weimbs Orgelbau from Hellenthal. It is composed of 1,956 pipes and 35 registers; the original pipework is still largely intact.  Cloister glass  The original Romanesque cloister was replaced between 1492 and 1517 by a Gothic one. After the dissolution in 1802 the stained glass windows, made between 1526 and 1557 by Gerhard Remisch, were sold by a local dealer to a compatriot in Norwich in England. Some panels found their way to village churches in East Anglia, but the majority reached Lord Brownlow's collection at Ashridge Park, from where they were purchased by the Victoria and Albert Museum. Two panels are now in Steinfeld again. While at Ashridge the glass was catalogued by M. R.

It was located in what is now the hamlet (frazione) of Cospaia in the comune of San Giustino in the Province of Perugia. History It unexpectedly gained independence in 1440 after Pope Eugene IV, embroiled in a struggle with the Council of Basel, made a sale of territory to the Republic of Florence. By error, a small strip of land went unmentioned in the sale treaty and its inhabitants declared themselves independent. The misunderstanding arose from the fact that, about 500 meters from the stream that was to establish the demarcation (simply called \\"Rio\\"), there was a homonymous stream. The delegates of the Florentine republic considered the \\"Rio\\" which was located further north as the new delimitation, whereas the delegates of the Papal States considered it the one further south. Thus a sort of terra nullius was formed whose inhabitants declared themselves independent, no longer subject to any authority. In 1484 its autonomy was formally recognized. On May 25, 1826, Cospaia was divided between Tuscany and the Papal States. The treaty was signed by the fourteen surviving members of Cospaia, in exchange for a silver coin, and being allowed to grow up to half a million tobacco plants a year. =Birth of the republic= The republican form of government, was extremely rare until the French Revolution. There were maritime republics (with aristocratic institutions), the Republic of San Marino and alleged Republic of Senarica (in Abruzzo), with an elected doge akin to the system used in Venice, but its real existence has not been historically proven with proper documentation. The cospaiesi, therefore, preferred to base their independence on the total freedom of the inhabitants, all holders of sovereignty, not entrusted to any organ of power, unlike in states. Cospaia also had an official flag, which is still used on some occasions. The banner was characterized by a black and a white field, divided diagonally. In the coat of arms there appeared \\"the village between the two small streams, with two fish on the right and the plant of Nicotiana tabacum on the left, above was the motto and years of the republic\\". The cospaiesi did not, therefore, have tribute obligations with either the Papal States nor the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, and the goods that passed through the territory were not subject to any tariffs; it was therefore a free economic zone and buffer state between the two powers. Although Cospaia extended over just 330 hectares (2 kilometers long and about 500 meters wide), the 250 inhabitants treasured the situation and took advantage of it to increase the cultivation of tobacco, among the first in the Italian peninsula. Even now, some varieties of tobacco are defined with the name of cospaia. Cospaia was an early centre of tobacco production within Italy, using 25 hectares of fertile soil to grow it. One of the reasons for the prosperity of Cospaia was that it was the only place in Italy that didn't follow with the papal ban on tobacco growing, thus ensuring a monopoly on production. =Form of government= San Giustino Umbro, Cospaia The Republic of Cospaia did not have a formal government or official legal system. There were no jails or prisons and there was no standing army or police force. At the head of the administration, there was the Council of Elders and Family Heads, which was summoned for decision making and judicial duties. The curate of San Lorenzo also took part in the meetings of the \\"Council of Elders\\", as \\"president\\", a position shared with a member of the Valenti family, the most important in the country. Council meetings were held in the Valenti house until 1718, when the council began to meet in the Church of the Annunciation, where they would stay until the republic's dissolution. On the architrave of the church door one can still read the only written law of the tiny republic: \\"Perpetua et firma libertas\\", or Perpetual and secure freedom. The Latin phrase referred to was also engraved on the parish bell. After several centuries of existence, Cospaia was reduced to a mere receptacle of contraband. The concept of freedom was somewhat tarnished in favor of its privileges, which attracted people of all kinds, for economic reasons or to escape the justice of the two large adjacent states. This situation was not unusual in the small states, especially in the \\"border\\" ones.Graziano Graziani, Stati d'eccezione, Roma, edizioni dell'asino, 2012, p. 15. =End of the republic= After the end of the Napoleonic Era, on 26 June 1826, with an act of submission by fourteen representatives of the republic, Cospaia became part of the Papal States: every Cospaiese, as \\"compensation\\", obtained a papal silver coin and the authorization to continue tobacco cultivation, which was taken over by rich local landowners such as the Collacchioni and the Giovagnoli, who bought most of the territory contained within the borders of the former republic. They then extended tobacco production to the whole valley, imposing it as the principal agricultural commodity.Enrico Fuselli, Cospaia tra tabacco, contrabbando e dogane, San Giustino, Fondazione per il Museo Storico Scientifico del Tabacco, 2014. pg. 39 See also *Republic of Senarica *List of historic states of Italy *European microstates *List of republics References * External links * Ex Repubblica di Cospaia * The Republic of Cospaia: An Anarchist Renaissance City by Ellie McFarland Category:States and territories disestablished in 1826 Category:States and territories established in 1440 Category:Former countries on the Italian Peninsula Category:Former republics Category:History of Tuscany Category:History of Umbria ","title":"Republic of Cospaia"},{"id":"18120279","text":"Yanun () is a Palestinian village in the Nablus Governorate in northern West Bank, located southeast of Nablus, and 3 miles north of Aqraba.

According to Edward Robinson, Yanun corresponds to the Jan≈ç(·º∏Œ±ŒΩ·Ωº) of Eusebius and Jerome, a village in Acrabatene east of Neapolis, which, according to Robinson, these two Church fathers confused with the ancient frontier town of Yano·∏•ah(◊ô◊†◊ï◊ó◊î) of Naphtali, which belonged to the Tribe of Ephraim.Robinson, 1856, p. 297Saunders, 1881, p. 226 Victor Gu√©rin argued that both Eusebius and Jerome had confused the Yano·∏•ah of the tribe of Ephraim with the quite distinct, homophonous village belonging to the tribe of Naphtali (p. 7) Modern researchers, following Guerin, have suggested that the Biblical Yano·∏•ah refers to Khirbet Yanun, as pottery sherds from lron Age I has been found there, and not at Yanun.Finkelstein and Lederman, 1997, p. 828 Several caves dot the area, which the local school headmaster claims were dwelt in by the Canaanites.

The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 33,3% on various agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, olives, goats or beehives, and a press for olives or grapes; a total of 7,500 ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 135 Edward Robinson visited Yanun in 1852. He wrote that the village was mostly in ruins and only a few houses were inhabited. In the 19th century, Yanun was settled by some 50 Bushnaks (Bosniaks), Muslims from Bosnia, after their country was ceded to the Austro-Hungarian Empire by the Congress of Berlin. The sultan Abdul Hamid gave the immigrants a significant part of the village. According to Haaretz, these were soldiers sent to reinforce Ottoman rule in Palestine. Adopting a common surname, Bushnak, they later moved to nearby Nablus and leased their farmlands to villagers from Aqraba who gradually left their village to settle in Yanun themselves. The villagers are their partners and descendants. In 1870, Victor Gu√©rin visited, and noted the Neby Nun east of Yanun.Gu√©rin, 1875, pp. 6-8 In the 1882, the Survey of Western Palestine described it as \\"A small village on the edge of a deep valley, with a sacred place to the east (Neby Nun), and a small spring about 1 mile to the north\\".Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 387 =British Mandate era= In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Yanun had a population of 70; all Muslim,Barron, 1923, Table IX, Sub-district of Nablus, p. 25 increasing in the 1931 census to 120, still all Muslims, in a total of 22 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 66 According to the 1945 statistics, Yanun had a population of 50 Muslims,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics, 1945, p. 19 with a total of 16,439 dunams of land,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

After the 1995 accords, 31% of the land of Aqraba/Yanun was classified as Area B, the remaining 69% as Area C.Aqraba Town Profile (including Yanun Locality) ARIJ, p. 16 As of 2002, the village is still leased by the residents of Aqraba and payment for leasing the land could be made in the form of wheat, olive oil or cash. About three-quarters of Yanun's 16,000 dunams of land is still leased. According to Vikram Sura, Itamar settlers used to trade with local farmers and visit Yanun to enjoy refreshments like cardamom-spiced coffee and mint tea there. In the mid-late 1990s, Itamar began 'annexing' hills stretching out from the settlement towards Yanun. Trailer homes from Itamar began to be set up along the ridge overlooking the village. The last, \\"Givot Olam\\" (hills of the universe), looking down over the village of Yanun, was created by Avri Ran, who obtained the land by trespassing on Yanun-owned areas and on Israeli state land, and assaulting any Palestinians who approached his settlement.Chaim Levinson, 'Israeli 'hilltop youth' accuse their former hero of stealing settlers' land,' at Haaretz, 31 January 2013. Though they felt surrounded, the Yanun villagers did not feel vulnerable. Relations changed with the outbreak of the Al-Aqsa Intifada in October 2000, when 13 Israeli Arabs were shot dead during the suppression of a riot protesting the visit of Ariel Sharon to the Temple Mount. Yanun lies far from the main areas where Palestinian militants and the IDF subsequently clashed, and till then grievances between the two communities were less than the norm. Over the next three years, Palestinian militants killed roughly 11 Itamar settlers. A Californian who made aliyah to Itamar later accused Yanun of having aided these terrorists. No member of the village has been linked to any attack on settlers.Palestinians 'forced to abandon village,' BBC News, 21 October 2002. The youths on Avri Ran's hilltop outpost argue that they have a prerogative to respond with violence when they feel their Palestinian neighbours are preventing them from realizing their right, as legal heirs of God's bequest, to work the land.Pedahzur and Perliger, 2013, p. 115 Armed settlers, according to local reports began to hinder Yanun farmers from harvesting their olive crops, intimidating the villagers and damaging the village's electrical generator.Vikram Sura, ‚ÄòNo olive branch for Yanun?‚Äô, at The Hindu, October 12, 2003. According to a survey reported and compiled by Yanun councilor Abdelatif Sobih, Yanun villagers have since been subjected to repeated assaults on their homes and farms; beatings; shootings, some resulting in death; poisoning and shootings of their flocks; the use of fierce dogs to impede farmer access to their lands; blocking of their access roads; pollution of their water resource; destruction of their electric generator, constructed with a donation from the Economic Development Group; the ploughing of fields sown with crops, or the burning of crops at harvest time; theft of olive trees; shooting at relatives' cars travelling to visit Yanun; and interrogation of teachers at the Yanun elementary school.Settlers Force Desertion of Yanun Village, Settlement Report  Vol. 12 No. 6  November‚ÄìDecember 2002, Foundation for Middle East PeaceFerran Izquierdo Brichs, \\"El cor de la neteja √®tnica: Relat d'un viatge a Cisjord√†nia i la Franja de Gaza\\" in Bel√©n Vic√©ns (coord.), L'Orient Mitj√† en el punt de mira, Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona, 2005 p.132 2002 temporary exodus Assaults and shootings by settlers at Palestinian farmers and foreign volunteers at olive harvest time took place in 2002.Shulman, 2008, pp. 8, 107-108, 181-2. A Council spokesman for the Israeli settlement of Itamar, in response to queries about the incidents, replied that he was unaware of claims of harassment and that settlers were trying to keep Palestinian villagers away from themselves. Another Itamar spokesman told The Guardian at the time ‚ÄúIf anyone is being terrorized it is us. Arabs have to learn that if they continue to be violent they can‚Äôt live here. There is all this talk of Arab olives, what about Jewish blood?‚Äù The village was temporarily abandoned on October 19, 2002,Robert Blecher, 'Living on the Edge: The Threat of \\"Transfer\\" in Israel and Palestine,' in Beinin and Stein, 2006, p. 191 dates the evacuation to the day before: 'Piling their furniture and personal belongings into a truck, the last residents of Yanun abandoned their West Bank village on October 189, 2002. \\"Our life here is more bitter than hell,\\" said one villager, lamenting years of attacks, recently intensified, from Israeli settlers living nearby. In the past months, rampaging bands had smashed windows, destroyed water tanks, burned the village's electric generator, stolen sheep, beaten villagers, and shot at workers in the fields.' the first exodus in recent times of a Palestinian community abandoning a village in the wake of attacks by settlers. The last of 25 families relocated to nearby Aqraba after a reported worsening in their harassment by Itamar residents, including Avri Ran and his organization, the Hilltop Youth. Two aged people stayed behind, refusing to accept the village decision to go.Lavie, Aviv. Avri Ran has a farm and Jewish followers in the West Bank. But for his Arab neighbours, it's a rule by force Ha'aretz. 2003-09-04. The village was re-occupied with the aid of peace activists from Ta'ayush and the International Solidarity Movement, who came and held a round-the-clock presence there for two weeks when the villagers started moving out in response to harassment.Reinhart, 2006, p. 176Yizhar, 2008, Afterword, pp. 127-128. The presence of foreign volunteers as witnesses has acted as a brake on settler assaults.‚Äô On Friday, 18 October 2002, the last remaining residents (17 families) of Yanun village (10km south- east of Nablus) fled to the nearby village of Aqraba for fear of further settler violence. Originally home to 25 families, Yanun has, for the last four years, suffered from constant harassment and attacks from the settlers of Itamar settlement. The settlers had set up a series of \\"illegal outposts\\" surrounding the village. During October there was an increase in settler attacks due to the advent of the olive harvest. Villagers reported that the settlers have been attacking the village on a weekly basis, which has led to one death and several people injured. The settlers, they report, have been entering the village at night on horseback with their faces covered, have been firing at the village, smashing windows, breaking doors, and they have cut off the village's water and electricity supplies.Yanun's residents depend on agriculture and the olive harvest for their livelihood. They reported that settlers had issued a direct threat ordering them not to harvest their olives or they would be shot at whenever they attempted to enter their fields. Moreover, farms have been attacked, sheep poisoned, crops burned and shepherds prevented from reaching the pastures to tend to their flocks.Yanun is believed to be the first case in recent years in which the entire population of a village has fled to escape settler violence and intimidation. As a result, volunteers from the Israeli-Palestinian organization Ta'ayush, Israeli volunteers, and foreign volunteers from the International Solidarity Movement went to the area intending to stay a couple of weeks to give the villagers some \\"protection\\" and to encourage their return to Yanun. * Encouraged, some families did decide to return. However, the presence of volunteers did not deter some settlers. On Sunday 27 October, the olive pickers were again attacked by settlers and four Palestinians, including two children, and four volunteers were reported injured. *Information from a team of NGO and UN staff who visited Yanun on 22 October.‚Äô OCHA, ‚ÄôOCHA Humanitarian Update Occupied Palestinian Territories, 31 Oct 2002 Ta'ayush activist David Nir was reportedly pushed by Avri Ran in Yanun. Amiel Vardi, professor of classics at Hebrew University, was also shot there by a settler whom he subsequently identified and took to court. The case was dismissed.Shulman, 2008, pp. 78, 107-108, 181-2. Since 2003, EAPPI has maintained a round-the-clock protective presence in Yanoun, reporting on human rights violations. On October 30, 2002, together with David Shulman, a group that included the distinguished Israeli writers Amos Oz, Meir Shalev, A. B. Yehoshua, David Grossman, the daughter of Haim Gouri, with Rabbi Menachem Froman, co-founder of Gush Emunim and a settler in Tekoa, Ian Buruma and an assortment of Israeli television camera crews and journalists visited Yanun to assist the returned villagers with their harvest and ward off settlers.Shulman, 2008, pp. 107-113. According to Shulman, one of the settler rabbis had declared that Jews had the right to steal olives from the Palestinians, since the land belonged to the former. Rabbi Froman, armed with a heavy pile of books, including the Gemara and Shulchan Aruch, turned up to show that these texts actually forbid stealing olives from non-Jews.Shulman, 2008, p. 109 Incidents Early in 2012, the IDF began reviewing plans to revive a dormant firing range, 904A, in the area, and began forbidding Palestinians from using the area, though the ban does not apply to settlers of the Giva 777 outpost of Itamar. Over the summer, Rahed Fahmi, the head of the Yanun council, together with Rabbis for Human Rights and an Israeli-Palestinian association Lohamin Leshalom (Fighting for Peace) have been involved in an intense campaign to convince Israeli authorities of the right of Yanun and Aqraba villagers to their lands. They succeeded in obtaining a right to visit their fields for one week, from July 3 to July 10, by which time the wheatcrop had mostly withered.Amira Hass, 'Lambs to the settlers' slaughter, screaming and unheard,' at [Haaretz], 5 August 2012. On Saturday July 7, two military jeeps accompanied the farmers to their fields. According to local farmers, sheep were being beaten by settlers. According to the EAPPI and Amira Hass, dozens of Jewish settlers attacked Yanun, one of 50 settler assaults in the West Bank in that month, assailed villagers and killed three sheep, with four villagers, members of the Bani Jaber family, badly injured and requiring hospital treatment. In the assault one was beaten and later handcuffed by soldiers who intervened. A fifth, Jawdat Ibrahim, was reportedly beaten, wounded, bound and left in a field, where he was found the following day. 'Settler attack on Yanoun leaves 5 injured.', EAPPI 9. July, 2012. According to an IDF source, the Israeli army intervened in a stone- throwing fray between settlers and villagers, and used tear-gas to stop the clash.The Associated Press 'Palestinians claim Jewish settlers attack villagers, killed livestock,' at Haaretz, July 8, 2012 According to an official of the Nablus Governorate, one of the victims, Jawdat Bani Jabir, was shot in the face and the foot by soldiers and subsequently stabbed by settlers. Five head of cattle were also slaughtered.Palestinian Jawdat Bani Jabir, 43 years old, stabbed and shot in settler attack near Nablus. Ma'an News Agency, 7 July 2012. According to the EAPPI, \\"The attack began mid- afternoon, when three Palestinian farmers working in their fields were set upon by settlers armed with machine guns and knives. The settlers stabbed three of the farmers‚Äô sheep to death. When EAs arrived at the scene at the request of the head of the village, there were also fires burning in two wheat fields and an olive grove. Israeli soldiers fired tear gas at Palestinians who were trying to reach the area to put out the fires.\\" The day after another 10 sheep of the flock died. The entire area reserved for their agriculture is now denied them, but the fields are now tended by settlers permitted to live in the new firing range. EAPPI reported that Rashed Murrar, head of the village, fears that the intention of the attack was to cause the Palestinian villages to give up their wheat fields. The village, which is home to just 65 people, is surrounded by Israeli outposts, which are considered illegal both under international law and Israeli law. The villagers reportedly managed to deter settlers who undertook an attack on the village during the olive harvest in October 2015.'Settler attacks continue in Nablus area, olive trees burned,' Ma'an News Agency 9 October 2015.  Critical judgements  The civilian population of Yanun, along with that of Bil'in, Jinba and several other places, in the judgement of scholar and Ta'ayush peace activist David Shulman, has been subject to practices that are 'singularly cruel'. Amira Hass, writing for Haaretz, argues that the systematic attacks on Palestinian villagers like those at Yanun, who are Semites, constitute a form of Antisemitism, with the difference that such assaults in the West Bank are rarely if ever reported.Amira Hass, 'The anti-Semitism that goes unreported. Tens of thousands of people live in the shadow of terror,' at Haaretz, 18 July 2012. The recent history of the village has been cited for the theory that after the Oslo Accords, Israel is applying a policy of slow transfer of Palestinians from villages near Israeli settlements on the West Bank.McMahon, 2010, pp. 82-83. The Spanish scholar, Ferran Izquierdo Brichs, cites what has happened there as an example of ethnic cleansing.Ferran Izquierdo Brichs, \\"El cor de la neteja √®tnica: Relat d'un viatge a Cisjord√†nia i la Franja de Gaza\\" in Bel√©n Vic√©ns (coord.), L'Orient Mitj√† en el punt de mira, Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona, 2005, p.132: 'El poble de Yanun s'ha convertit en l'exemple m√©s visible de la pol√≠tica de desestructuraci√≥ econ√≤mica i d'assetjament com a mecanismes de neteja √®tnica.'  Environment  Yanun has been described as an 'idyllic village', if one discards its recent troubles.Irving, 2012, p. 229: 'If it weren't for the threats posed to it by Itamar, Yanoun would seem an idyllic village.' Driving in from Aqraba, fine views of hillocks full of olive groves meet the eye, while to the right the land falls steeply down into the Jordan Valley.Baltzer, 2007, pp. 41ff., 43.

Richard Jukes Rev. Richard Jukes (1804‚Äì1867) was a popular Primitive Methodist minister and hymn writer. This article provides a brief biography, and a summary of his work as a popular minister and hymn writer during the first half-century of Primitive Methodism. Biography Richard Jukes was born on 9 October 1804 at Goathill, and died 10 August 1869. He served as a Primitive Methodist minister from 1827 to 1859. Jukes married Phoebe Pardoe in 1825, and later, widowed, he married Charlotte.W Leary, Directory of Primitive Methodist Ministers and their Circuits, (1990), p. 119, hb or sb =Circuits= *1827 ‚Äì Hopton Bank *1828 ‚Äì Brinkworth *1829 ‚Äì Brinkworth (6 months) *1829 ‚Äì Motcombe (6 months) *1830 ‚Äì Pillowell *1831 ‚Äì Salisbury *1832 ‚Äì Birmingham *1833 ‚Äì Nottingham *1834 ‚Äì Ramsor *1838 ‚Äì Darlaston *1842 ‚Äì Tunstall *1845 ‚Äì Congleton *1846 ‚Äì Dudley *1849 ‚Äì Darlaston *1851 ‚Äì Brierley Hill *1853 ‚Äì Coventry *1855 ‚Äì West Bromwich *1859 ‚Äì West Bromwich (retired) Leary, op. cit. Work as a minister While Richard Jukes left his mark in Kendall's history as a hymn writer, his work as a minister was widely appreciated. It is noteworthy that, after a number of appointments where he would have been the junior, Jukes was appointed to three of the most significant Circuits of that time. Tunstall, Staffordshire was the place of origin of Primitive Methodism and Ramsor had been almost as significant. Darlaston was very much the leading light in the Black Country.Kendall, ‚ÄúOrigin and History of the Primitive Methodist Church‚Äù, 1906, Vol 1, p.519-522 Jukes spent a large part of his active ministry in The Black Country and retired there. Hugh Bourne reveals a special interest in Ramsor in his writings in The Primitive Methodist Magazine, through the way he illustrates articles with anecdotes of Ramsor people.Hugh Bourne, ‚ÄúThe Primitive Methodist Magazine‚Äù, November 1824; Anecdote of a Present Salvation is a typical example. Hymns Holliday Bickerstaffe Kendall says of Richard Jukes, ‚Äúalthough he was a prolific and popular hymn-writer of his day, is in some danger of being forgotten.‚Äù Kendall, ‚ÄúOrigin and History of the Primitive Methodist Church‚Äù, 1906, Vol 2, p.33 The major biography of Jukes has the title \\"Poet of a Million\\", reflecting this claim to fame. Kendall also says, ‚ÄúJukes‚Äô hymns have been sung from one end of the Connexion to the other, by tramps in the street and Christians in the chapels; and the late Dr. Massie says, the hymn entitled ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the news,‚Äù &co.;, has been sung and repeated in the great Revival in Ireland.‚Äù Kendal, op. cit. =Hymn tunes= Part of the genius of Richard Jukes the hymn writer was his ability (shared with other Primitive Methodists including Henry Higginson ) to use the best popular melodies of his time. A contemporary account by a Jonathan Ireland in Lancashire will be useful to researchers into 19th-century hymns. > Before the Primitive Methodists came to this city (Manchester), and for some > time after, it was very common to hear lewd or ribald songs sung in the > streets, especially on the Lord‚Äôs day. But our movements drove them away by > putting something better in their place. We used to pick up the most > effective tunes we heard, and put them to our hymns; and at our camp > meetings people, chiefly young ones, used to run up to hear us, thinking we > were singing a favourite song. But they were disappointed therein; > nevertheless, they were arrested and often charmed by the hymn, which at > times went with power to their hearts. And so the words of the hymn put > aside the words of the song. It will show the utility of singing lively > hymns in the streets; yea, more particularly, it will show the use to > society in general of our hymn singing in the streets, if I here relate a > fact which was told me by a friend on whose veracity and accuracy I can > place reliance. He said : ‚ÄúI was one day in a hair-dresser‚Äôs shop in a > country village, when a man came in to be shaved, having a handful of > printed hymns, which he had been singing and selling in the streets. I > entered into conversation with him, in course of which he said : ‚ÄúYour Jukes > has been a good friend to us street-singers; I have sung lots of his hymns, > and made many a bright shilling thereby. People generally would rather hear > a nice hymn sung, than a foolish song, ‚Äì and his hymns are full of sympathy > and life. Depend on it, the singing of hymns in the streets has done a good > deal of good ; for children stand to listen to us, and they get hold of a > few lines, or of the chorus ; and with the tune, or as much of it as they > can think of, they run home, and for days they sing it in their homes, and > their mothers and sisters get hold of it, and in this way, I maintain, our > hymn-singing is of more use than many folks think. I shall always think well > of Jukes,‚Äù concluded the man. Kendall, op. cit. =The hymn \\"Christ for me\\"= Much of Jukes‚Äô output seems to have been published in special collections. Unfortunately, his writing was not used in many hymn books, and the only hymn to have survived in common use is ‚ÄúChrist for me‚Äù. Even this was not used in the 1882 Primitive Methodist Hymnal, but only in the 1911 Supplement. As an example of Jukes' hymns, here is the version used in the 1911 Supplement. Other verses have been sung. My heart is fixed eternal God, Fixed on Thee : Fixed on Thee : And my immortal choice is made : Christ for me. He is my Prophet, Priest and King, Who did for me salvation bring ; And while I‚Äôve breath I mean to sing : Christ for me. Christ for me. 2 In Him I see the Godhead shine ; Christ for me. Christ for me. He is the Majesty Divine ; Christ for me. The Father‚Äôs well-beloved Son, Co-partner of His royal throne, Who did for human guilt atone ; Christ for me. Christ for me. 3 Let others boast their heaps of gold; Christ for me. Christ for me. His riches never can be told ; Christ for me. Your gold will waste and wear away, Your honours perish in a day ; My portion never can decay ; Christ for me. Christ for me. 4 In pining sickness or in health, Christ for me. Christ for me. In deepest poverty or wealth, Christ for me. And in that all-important day, When I the summons must obey, And pass from this dark world away, Christ for me. Christ for me. R.

While on the air, they may ask for donations to support their ministries. Most hours begin with world and national news from the Salem Radio Network (SRN News). History In 1950, the station signed on as KFGQ-FM in Boone, Iowa.Broadcasting Yearbook 1952 page 138 It was the FM counterpart to AM 1260 KFGQ, (now KDLF). Both stations were owned by the Boone Biblical College. Because the AM station was a daytimer, required to sign off at sunset, the religious programming could be heard around the clock on KFBQ- FM. The transmitter and broadcast tower were originally located in southwest Boone, Iowa on West Park Avenue. The call sign switched to KFFF-FM on February 1, 2005. The call letters switched again in 2010 to KTIA. Truth Broadcasting applied to move KTIA's transmitter from Boone to Huxley and also change the city of license to Huxley. This move would represent a 15-mile relocation to the southeast and provide a better signal to the Des Moines area, thus adding 400,000 people into KTIA's listening range. Truth had opposition from Saga Communications, which owns several Des Moines radio stations. Saga said the move would put KTIA in the Des Moines and Ames media markets. That resulted in the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in serving Truth Broadcasting with a Deficiency Letter that gave the owners the opportunity to rebut Saga's assertion. Truth Broadcasting countered with its own petition asking that the Deficiency Letter be reviewed and reversed because the move could not hit the Des Moines market without being over 50% of the metro, while the Commission noted that at one site with a directional pattern, the signal could get into over 50% of the Ames area. As a result of this, the FCC denied Truth's request and Petition for reconsideration, thus canceling the application.FCC Nixes KTIA Move from All Access (December 23, 2013) After reconsidering the decision, the FCC reversed its previous ruling and granted the construction permit for KTIA moving to Huxley. The station was issued its license to cover Huxley on July 6, 2015. The move of the studios, transmitter and other broadcast oriented items was accomplished in May/June 2015.

Early life The third son of Labour politician Donald Anderson, Baron Anderson of Swansea and his missionary wife Dorothy, herself the daughter of Bolivian missionaries, he was raised at his parents' London home in Notting Hill. Anderson was educated at Fox School in Notting Hill and Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith. Taking a gap year in Asia, Anderson says he lived the hippy life and smoked dope. He then undertook a degree in history at Queens' College, University of Cambridge, and then an MA in revolutions at Sussex University. Thereafter he went to Goa, India where he eked a living as a hippy selling trinkets on Goa's beaches. Banking In 1996, Anderson's older brother Hugh who worked as fund manager with Dutch investment bank ABN Amro arranged an interview for him. In a later interview with Al Jazeera, Anderson mused that at that time, he knew nothing about either finance or the City. Anderson was resultantly employed as a utilities analyst, composing models of publicly listed companies. Within five years, his salary had jumped from ¬£24,000 to ¬£120,000; his first three years of bonuses: ¬£14,000; ¬£55,000 and ¬£140,000. In 1997 he moved to Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, and in 1999 to Commerzbank. In 2000 Anderson joined Dresdner Kleinwort. He was named top stock-picker two years running, appointed joint team leader of the utilities research team, his team became number two in the utilities sector and Anderson was personally judged the fourth highest-ranked analyst (out of around 100). City Boy Anderson started writing his City Boy column in the third quarter of 2006 for thelondonpaper, which became a popular piece with some readers of the newly launched free newspaper. On 18 June 2008, it was revealed that Anderson was the columnist City Boy of thelondonpaper. The following week he published his first book: Cityboy: Beer And Loathing In The Square Mile. A second book Cityboy: 50 Ways to Survive the Crunch was published in November 2008. In 2010 Anderson revealed that he was working on a third book, \\"Just Business\\". It is about a man who writes an anonymous column for a London-based newspaper, breaks into his boss‚Äôs computer and discovers a major crime.

It is the largest structure of its kind in the country. It was built between 1976 and 1985 and it generates approximately 15% of the country's power. The dam's construction was very controversial and displaced many indigenous Maya Achi peoples. Government forced relocations resulted in the R√≠o Negro massacres which claimed up to 5,000 lives between 1980 and 1982. History Construction on the dam started in 1976, with funding from the World Bank and the Inter- American Development Bank. Major redesign work was needed to address adjusted seismic criteria for the dam and tunnelling works, following the heavy 1976 earthquake. Additional costs were made to correct engineering errors, and to finance repairs to tunnel damage in the first year of operation, resulting in substantial over-budgeting. From the US$372.7 million calculated costs in 1978, the Chixoy project ended up costing US$944 million. The construction of the dam, and its reservoir, displaced several local communities with a total population of 3,445 people. Community resettlement efforts were poorly handled by the consecutive military governments at the time. Subsequent popular protests and claims were met with extremely brutal repression by government forces, and culminated in what is known as the R√≠o Negro Massacres. Claims have not yet been settled 25 years after the hydro-electric plant went into operation. Power plant The hydroelectricity plant has 5 x 60 MWe pelton turbines with an effective capacity of 275 MWe, which is approximately 15% of Guatemala's total electricity production (2006) and 60% of INDE's electricity production. A 26 km long tunneling system with an elevation difference of 433 m, feeds the water to the plant's turbines.

It is located at 580 Frederick Street, and is currently the administrative headquarters of the Detroit Medical Society. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Building construction and description The building housing the Dunbar Hospital was built in 1892 by the Guy W. Vinton Company as a home for real estate developerDunbar Hospital from the National Park Service Charles W. Warren.Dunbar Hospital from the state of Michigan The home was constructed in a fashionable 19th century residential district. The structure is a three-story home of mixed Romanesque Revival and Queen Anne style,[Eric J. Hill, John Gallagher, and the American Institute of Architects Detroit Chapter,] AIA Detroit: The American Institute of Architects Guide to Detroit Architecture, Wayne State University Press, 2002, , p. 182 built of red brick and rough-cut ashlar. The entrance is through a recessed, arched first-floor porch and the second story has a double-arch brick balcony. The roof is slate, with a bay-windowed gabled dormer surmounting the front fa√ßade. Founding of the Dunbar Hospital In 1894, Dr. James W. Ames, a graduate of both Straight University and Howard University, arrived in Detroit after a stint of teaching in New Orleans. He quickly became influential in both Detroit's white community and its then- small black community. Detroit's mayor at the time was Hazen Pingree. During his subsequent re-election campaign, Pingree actively courted the black vote, in part by supporting Ames's bid for election to the Michigan state legislature.Vivian M. Baulch, \\"How Detroit got its first black hospital,\\" The Detroit News, November 28, 1995. The nationally famous black poet Paul Laurence Dunbar, popular in both the black and white community, visited Detroit and lent his voice to those supporting Pingree, penning the poem, \\"Vote for Pingree and Vote for Bread.\\" Both Ames and Pingree won their respective elections, and Ames spent the next two years in the legislature. He was the last black elected until the 1920s. Two decades later, in the years following World War I, the black population of Detroit soared. In 1910, fewer than 6000 blacks called the city home; in 1917 more than 30,000 blacks lived in Detroit. The increase in black residents led to a crisis in health care. Hospitals were still segregated, and physicians like Ames were required to ask permission to admit black patients. Often black patients were simply denied care. The increase in the black population threatened to overwhelm the city's 30 black doctors. In 1918, Ames led the group of 30 black physicians to form the Allied Medical Society. The area around Frederick street was at the cusp of becoming the center of social and cultural life for Detroit's black community, and the AMS purchased the Warren home on Frederick They opened their own non-profit hospital in the building, the first in the city to serve the black community, as well as an associated nursing school. The hospital was named for the poet Dunbar, who had died in 1906. The hospital had 27 beds and an operating room.\\"Black-Owned and Operated Hospitals in the Detroit Metropolitan Area during the 20th Century,\\" University of Michigan Medical School, Winter Newsletter 1998 Later history In 1928, demand led Dunbar Hospital to move from its first home to a larger facility several blocks to the east. The facility was renamed Parkside Hospital, and continued in operation until 1962. Soon after Dunbar moved from its home on Frederick, Charles Diggs Sr., who was later the first African-American Democratic state senator, purchased the home. Diggs's son, Charles C. Diggs Jr., served in the Michigan State Senate from 1951 to 1954 and the U.S. House of Representatives from 1954 to 1980. In 1978, the Detroit Medical Society (the successor to the Allied Medical Society) purchased and restored the building. It now serves as their administrative headquarters and a museum.

Known as Hawthorne Road, the state highway runs from MD 210 in Potomac Heights east to U.S. Route 301 (US 301) in La Plata. MD 225 connects La Plata, the county seat of Charles County, with Indian Head in the northwestern part of the county, which is home to Indian Head Naval Surface Warfare Center. The state highway was designated one of the original state roads by the Maryland State Roads Commission and constructed in the mid 1910s. MD 225 was reconstructed in the early 1950s, shortly after the highway's western terminus was moved to Potomac Heights following the completion of Indian Head Highway during World War II. Route description View west along MD 225 at MD 224 in Mason Springs MD 225 begins at an intersection with MD 210 (Indian Head Highway) in Potomac Heights. The state highway heads south as a two-lane undivided road, descending into the forested bottomlands of Mattawoman Creek, where the highway intersects the Indian Head Rail Trail and intersects MD 224 (Livingston Road). The two highways join in a concurrency to cross the creek into the hamlet of Mason Springs, where MD 224 diverges to the west toward Marbury and MD 225 passes the historic home Araby. MD 225 heads southeast along the southern edge of Myrtle Grove Wildlife Management Area to the community of Ripley, where the highway curves east. At the hamlet of Marshalls Corner, the state highway intersects Marshall Corner Road, which heads north to Pomfret, and Rose Hill Road, which provides access to Thomas Stone National Historic Site. MD 225 passes the historic home Locust Grove before intersecting Valley Road and Mitchell Road at the corner of the Hawthorne Country Club. Valley Road heads north toward a trio of historic homes--Linden, Mount Carmel Monastery, and Thainston-- and the La Plata campus of the College of Southern Maryland. MD 225 enters the town of La Plata, passing through a residential area before heading south of a park and ride lot and reaching its eastern terminus at US 301 (Robert Crain Highway). The roadway continues east as Hawthorne Drive, the old alignment of MD 225, east to Washington Avenue, the old alignment of US 301. MD 225 is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial from Quailwood Parkway just west of the town of La Plata east to US 301 in La Plata. History The La Plata-Indian Head road was one of the original state roads marked for improvement by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1909. A short section of pavement had already been laid as a state aid road in Potomac Heights by 1910. The highway was constructed as a gravel road from Indian Head to Mason Springs in 1913 and from La Plata to Ripley in 1915. The gap between Mason Springs and Ripley was filled by 1919. In La Plata, the highway's eastern terminus was originally Washington Avenue, which was the original alignment of MD 3 and later US 301. MD 225 originally extended west along Strauss Avenue through Indian Head to the entrance to U.S. Naval Proving Ground. The state highway was supplanted by Indian Head Highway as the main access to the military base when that highway was constructed from Washington to Indian Head during World War II. MD 225 was relocated from Strauss Avenue to its present terminus western terminus in Potomac Heights in 1950. The state highway was widened to a road with a bituminous-stabilized gravel surface from La Plata to Ripley in 1949 and 1950 and from Ripley to Potomac Heights in 1951. MD 225 was resurfaced again in 1953 and 1954. MD 225's eastern terminus was rolled back from Washington Avenue to US 301 around 1956.

He was the first Arkansan to be successfully trained by the federal government as a civilian licensed pilot. He overcame the social injustices of racism and bigotry to serve his country during World War II as a civilian flight instructor. Early life Crenchaw was born to Reverend Joseph C. Crenchaw and Ethel Pitts Crenchaw at Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1919. His father was a local civil rights leader with the NAACP who was president of the Little Rock Chapter during the Little Rock Central High School Crisis, and a professional tailor. His mother was a beautician. Crenchaw had three siblings. He graduated from Dunbar High School (the local black high school) in 1936. After graduating, he attended Dunbar Junior College where he received a teaching certificate in auto mechanics. After leaving Dunbar Junior College, Crenchaw pursued a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering at the Tuskegee Institute in 1939. He did not receive a degree, however because he postponed his academics to pursue becoming a pilot. Crenchaw was the first Arkansan to arrive and to graduate from Moton Airbase in Tuskegee, Alabama. Aviation career Crenchaw went from living the life of a college student to flying in the Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP). The CPTP was sponsored by the Army Air Corps. He was a flight instructor. After the start of World War II, there was a shortage of pilots. To combat this problem, then President Franklin D. Roosevelt, helped start a program to train more civilian pilots (thus increasing military preparedness). Crenchaw graduated in 1941 with his civilian pilot certificate from the Army Air Corps program sponsored by the Civil Aeronautics Administration. Crenshaw was named Primary Flight Instructor in 1942 at Tuskegee Army Air Field in Tuskegee, Alabama. He was one of the two original supervising squadron members under Chief Pilot Charles A. Anderson. Anderson was the first African-American man to have a private pilot license in 1929. Mr. Crenchaw taught many pilots and cadets known as the Tuskegee Airmen. Some of the notables were William T. Mattison, Charles Debow, Daniel ‚ÄúChappie‚Äù James, Lieutenant Colonel Charles ‚ÄúChuck‚Äù Dryden, and fellow Arkansan Woodrow Crockett. Not only did Crenchaw serve at Tuskegee but he also served at Fort Sill in Oklahoma from 1953 to 1954, Camp Rucker (now Fort Rucker) in Alabama from 1954 to 1966, and Fort Stewart in Georgia from 1966 until 1972. While at Camp Rucker, Crenchaw conquered another first. He became the first black flight instructor on these predominantly white airbases. In 1947, Crenchaw returned to his hometown of Little Rock. He wanted to start aviation courses at Philander Smith College. He shared the idea to then-president, Dr. M. L. Harris. Harris agreed, and Philander Smith held such classes at Little Rock's Adams Field (now the Little Rock National Airport) in the building of the Central Flying Service. Crenchaw taught aviation at Philander Smith from 1947 to 1953. From 1972 until 1983, Crenchaw worked as an equal employment opportunity officer with the Department of Defense and as a race relations officer at Fort Stewart in Georgia. He died on November 17, 2015 at the age of 96 near Atlanta, Georgia from pneumonia and cardiovascular disease. Awards Crenchaw has received numerous awards and certificates for his role as a Tuskegee Airman. Milton Crenchaw was a member of the now-defunct Judge Robert Decatur Chapter of the Tuskegee Airmen, Inc. (TAI). He has received thanks from many including Congressman Vic Snyder and President Bill Clinton Crenchaw was inducted into the Arkansas Aviation Hall of Fame in 1998. On March 27, 2007, he was honored by Arkansas Governor Mike Beebe for his historic efforts as a Tuskegee flight instructor and service to his country. Along with all the other estimated 16-19,000 participants of the \\"Tuskegee Experience\\" (1941-1949), Crenchaw was collectively, not individually awarded the Congressional Gold Medal on March 29, 2007 by President George W. Bush in Washington, D.C. The Tuskegee Airmen are the largest group to ever receive this medal. The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest civilian honor bestowed by Congress. Crenchaw was inducted into the Arkansas Black Hall of Fame on October 27, 2007 due to the efforts of Edmond Davis; it is the topic of an upcoming book entitled, Airkansan: The Milton Crenchaw Story to be published in 2009.

He brought his kingdom greatness and prosperity. King Jayadewata often linked with King Siliwangi, the semi- legendary great king of Sunda. Some suggests that he was the real historic person that inspired the legend. However, other historian suggests that King Siliwangi might be inspired by other Sunda king. Historiography The historical record of his reign can be found in Batutulis inscription, discovered in Bogor, where he is known in his formal stylized name Sri Baduga Maharaja Ratu Haji di Pakwan Pajajaran Sri Sang Ratu Dewata. The inscription was created not during Sri Baduga's reign, but later in 1533 by Sri Baduga's son, King Surawisesa, to honor and commemorate his late father.Prasasti Batutulis, Arsip Kota Bogor Reign Batutulis inscription in Bogor mentioned about the historical great king Sri Baduga Maharaja. The stylized name: Sri Baduga Maharaja Ratu Haji di Pakwan Pajajaran Sri Sang Ratu Dewata literally means \\"His Majesty Maharaja King of Pakuan Pajajaran, His Excellency King of deities\\". Most of literature recognize his name as Sri Baduga Maharaja while other argues that it was only the title to address the king, as Baduga corresponds to paduka, the footwear of kings. According to Hindu etiquette the king is held so high that common people should not directly address the king by his name, but through his shoes. Thus his real name is Sang Ratu Jaya Dewata. According to Batutulis inscription, he is the son of Rahyang Niskala and the grandson of Rahyang Niskala Wastu Kancana. King Jayadewata become the king of the unified kingdom of Sunda and Galuh. He transferred the capital city from Kawali Galuh to Pakuan Pajajaran. One of the Pantun legends tells vividly about a beautiful royal procession of queen Ambetkasih and her courtiers moving to the new capital of Pakuan Pajajaran, where her husband awaits. The Batutulis inscriptions mentioned that the King has embarked in several public projects. Among others are erecting the wall and dug the defensive moat around his capital in Pakuan (modern Bogor), built Gugunungan religious sacred mounds, built Balay or pavilions, also created Samida forest as a conservation forest. He also built a dam and create a lake called Sanghyang Talaga Rena Mahawijaya. The lake is probably functioned as hydraulic project for rice agricultural purpose, and also a recreational lake to beautify his capital city. The tradition hailed that King Jayadewata ruled justly from his palace of Punta Bima Sri Narayana Suradipati Madura at Pakuan Pajajaran and his reign is celebrated as the golden age for Sundanese people.

The state highway runs from Marshall Hall east to U.S. Route 301 (US 301) in White Plains. MD 227 connects the communities of Bryans Road, Pomonkey, and Pomfret in northwestern Charles County. The state highway, which was constructed in the mid-1920s and early 1930s, originally had its western terminus at Pomonkey; the remainder of the current route was part of MD 224 and all of MD 226. MD 227 gained its present western terminus in the mid-1950s. Route description MD 227 eastbound at intersection with Brierwood Road near Pomfret View west along MD 227 at US 301 in White Plains MD 227 begins at a boat ramp on the Potomac River adjacent to the ruins of the namesake mansion at Marshall Hall within Piscataway Park. The state highway heads south as Marshall Hall Road, a two-lane undivided road through a forested area. MD 227 crosses Mill Swamp and begins to pass residential subdivisions as the highway approaches the community of Bryans Road, where the highway intersections MD 210 (Indian Head Highway). The state highway continues south as Livingston Road to Pomonkey, where MD 224 continues southwest as Livingston Road toward Mason Springs while MD 227 veers southeast as Pomfret Road. The state highway crosses Mattawoman Creek, passes by the historic farm McPherson's Purchase, and intersects the Indian Head Rail Trail on its way to Pomfret, where the highway meets Marshall Corner Road. MD 227 turns north onto Marshall Corner Road, curving to the east and passing the entrance to Green's Inheritance before meeting the southern end of MD 229 (Bensville Road). East of Pomfret, the state highway passes close to another pair of historic homes, Pleasant Hill and Oak Grove, the latter of which is on the intersecting Turkey Hill Road. MD 227 crosses Pages Swamp and passes close to another historic home, Spye Park, before reaching White Plains, where the state highway reaches its eastern terminus at US 301 (Robert Crain Highway) opposite county-maintained Willetts Crossing Road. History Present-day MD 227 was built as part of three different state highways. Livingston Road between Bryans Road and Pomonkey was constructed around 1923 as part of MD 224, which originally ran from MD 6 at Doncaster to the District of Columbia border in Forest Heights. Marshall Hall Road was built as MD 226 between 1924 and 1927. MD 227's portion of Marshall Corner Road was constructed between 1924 and 1926. The final portion of MD 227, Pomfret Road, was started in 1929 and complete from Marshall Corner Road to the bridge over Mattawoman Creek in 1930. The gap between Mattawoman Creek and Livingston Road was filled by 1933. MD 227 was extended north over Livingston Road and Marshall Hall Road to its present western terminus, taking over all of MD 226's course, in 1956.

During his crime rampage, he had committed a variety of criminal acts in several U.S. states, including sexual assault, robbery, and carjacking, and he caused the death of one person in a hit and run accident while attempting to flee law enforcement. His spree ended on May 11, 2001 in a New York hotel when he was shot to death by law enforcement agents. He was 35 years old. It was believed that compulsive gambling was his motivation for his life of crime as he became desperate to obtain money for additional gambling. In 2002, the story of Mansoor's life of crime was aired on The FBI Files, in an episode titled \\"High Stakes.\\" Crimes Mansoor was either convicted of or wanted for the following crimes: *In 1996, he was convicted of sexually abusing a 14-year-old girl. He served 6 months in prison. *In 1997, he was sentenced to 11 months in prison for violating the conditions of a plea agreement. *Kidnap and sexual assault of a 17-year-old girl in Las Vegas *Was the suspect in a 1998 Las Vegas rape case, but was never charged *Robbery of the Trump Taj Mahal hotel of over $500,000 in cash and valuables *On January 9, 2001, he was wanted for causing the death of a construction worker in Louisiana. This occurred after he was attempting to purchase a ticket at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport in New Orleans, when the sales clerk became suspicious of him and alerted police. Confronted by officers, he dashed into the airport's parking garage and carjacked a woman. He then led police on a high speed chase with the stolen vehicle, which he crashed into the worker, causing fatal injuries. Manhunt During a national manhunt for Mansoor, he was difficult to catch or identify. He had used a large number of aliases and disguises, making the determination of his identity or nationality a challenge for law enforcement.

The title is a reference to the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause. History \\"Rebel Without a Pause\\" was the first song created for It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back. The group had recently finished a tour with fellow Def Jam artists LL Cool J and Eric B. & Rakim, among others. According to Chuck D., the group felt that their prior album Yo! Bum Rush The Show was already dated, as production innovations had occurred during the album's release that he felt made it sound like a timestamp of 1986.Don't Rhyme For The Sake Of Riddlin' by Myrie, Russell Chuck D and Bomb Squad leader Hank Shocklee wanted to push the innovation in hip hop instead of follow it and decided one key idea to separate themselves from other hip hop acts was to speed the BPM of the songs. Chuck D said in an interview \\"Most rap records at the time had a BPM of 98 BPM. Our stuff was around 109.\\"The History Of Rock & Roll TLC Special, 1995 They had experimented with faster beats at concerts and loved the added energy it gave the crowd so decided they wanted to make a record to capture their live energy. Shocklee got the idea to sample an alto saxophone glissando from The J.B.'s instrumental \\"The Grunt\\", which became the track's distinctive whistling sound. He had a Mirage sampler that was only able to hold 4 bits' worth of audio (or 3 seconds) to create his demo to give to Chuck to write his rhymes. When they got to a studio and had a superior sampler, the S-900 that held 30 seconds of audio, they felt it took away the impact of the Mirage sample, which forced in a second of delay before the sample reloaded as opposed to the endless loop the studio's sampler gave, and decided to go with it instead. The song is widely remembered for the high- pitched scream effect sampled from \\"The Grunt\\".http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/video- archive/transcript/hank_shocklee__art_brut/transcript The same glissando sample was reversed and used in another track by Public Enemy‚Äî\\"Terminator X To the Edge of Panic\\".http://www.whosampled.com/sample/10493/Public-Enemy- Terminator-X-to-the-Edge-of-Panic-The-J.B.'s-The-Grunt/ The Bomb Squad could not find a drum sample they felt was adequate for what they wanted to create, so they instead had Flavor Flav, who was the best drummer of the group, play an original beat on their electronic drum. Chuck D wrote the rhymes in less than a day and took three takes before he was happy with his performance in the studio. Originally Public Enemy's longtime musical associate Johnny Juice was going to come in to record the scratching, but Public Enemy's live DJ Terminator X asked if they'd give him a chance to scratch on the song because he had some ideas for it and scratched out the famous \\"Rock And Roll\\" sample, which was dubbed \\"The Transformers Scratch\\" (taken from the belief that the scratch sounded like the noises the robots on the Transformers cartoon made when they transformed). Shocklee made the final mix with Steve Ett and upon hearing the finished product, Chuck D announced, \\"I could die tomorrow. Because that record right there? Nothing could f**king go nowhere near it.\\" The song was certified as an instant classichttps://hiphopgoldenage.com/list/top-100-hip-hop-songs-1980s/ by music critics and fans upon its release. Shocklee remembers knowing it was going to be a hit when he saw the reaction from the live crowds. \\"Public Enemy was performing, and they went halfway through the set. And halfway through the set Rebel came on. And I saw kids just running in the (Madison Square) Garden just like kids stealing their chains and shit, alright, because that was the highball, that was like the‚Äîthe scene was a fight breaking out on the floor.

He was a prominent official of the Han Dynasty, who served Emperor Wu of Han and his successor Emperor Zhao. He is famous for his economic policies during the reign of Emperor Wu, the best known of which include the state monopolies over iron and salt - systems which would be imitated by other dynasties throughout Chinese history. Due to political conflict, he was executed in 80 BC by Huo Guang (d. 68 BC). Sang was one of the participants in the debate of Salt and Iron which took place in 81 BC. Youth and Officialdom Sang Hongyang was born in Luoyang, one of the Han Dynasty's major commercial centres, to a family of merchants. In his youth, he was known for his mathematical prowess. When Emperor Wu ascended to the throne in 141 BC, Sang came to his notice and was eventually invited to become an Attendant (). This was one way which the Emperor gained and retained talented individuals in the palace, and by which many important officials began their careers. Sang would remain an Attendant for 26 years. Rise to Importance Sang's skill at economic policy would only come into play during the middle of Emperor Wu's reign. By then, the ongoing campaigns against the Xiongnu had drained the wealth built up by Emperor Wu's predecessors, and the state had entered a financial crisis. In 120 BC, the Minister of Agriculture, Zheng Dangshi, first proposed the idea of state monopolies on iron and salt, recommending two powerful salt and iron magnates to join the government and manage the industry on a national scale. Sang Hongyang was then assigned to aid the magnates in their planning. With the success of the monopolies in improving the empire's financial situation, Sang eventually rose to become Assistant Minister of Agriculture. As the Assistant Minister, Sang soon implemented several more measures to refill the national coffers. These included an asset tax, payable by artisans, bankers, merchants, and owners of carriages and boats, which was calculated according to the amount of assets. Smallholders only needed to pay half the official rate of tax. At the same time, laws were enacted under which false reporting and concealment of assets was punishable by confiscation of assets and exile to the borders for a year. People were encouraged to report cases of concealment with half the confiscated assets being awarded to the reporters. Imperial Secretary In 87 BC, Sang Hongyang became the Imperial Secretary (also known as Imperial Counsellor and Grandee Secretary), one of the three most senior posts in government known as the Three Excellencies. In the wake of the death of Emperor Wu and the installation of the child Emperor Zhao of Han in that year, Sang became one of the key politicians during the period of the triumvirate formed by Huo Guang, Jin Midi, and Shangguan Jie. However, Sang was executed in 80 BC by the regent Huo Guang on charges of treason for his alleged involvement in the attempted coup by Liu Dan, King of Yan, aimed at taking over the throne of Han and having Huo Guang murdered.Loewe (1986), 180-181.

PUMA began as an effort by supporters of Obama's primary rival, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who believed that Clinton should have been the Democratic nominee. According to PUMA, \\"We [were] protesting the 2008 Presidential election because we refuse to support a nominee who was selected by the leadership rather than elected by the voters.\\" On May 11, 2011, the PUMA PAC was stripped of its status as a recognized Political Action Committee for failure to meet reporting requirements. Organization =Origin= The PUMA PAC registered as a non-affiliated political action committee (PAC) with the Federal Election Commission and organized as a 527 Organization with the Internal Revenue Service in June 2008.PUMA PAC. PUMA's founders state that the group originated out of online comments of a group of Clinton supporters on a pro-Clinton blog, The Confluence, which was created by New Jersey biochemist and former John Edwards supporter \\"Riverdaughter,\\" who had been recently banned from a pro-Obama liberal blog. The website ClintonsForMcCain.com was, however, registered by the Republican National Committee on May 15, 2008, well in advance of Clinton's concession speech. PUMA was also part of a coalition of online activists with similar goals, the JustSayNoDeal coalition. The PUMA acronym as originally coined stood for \\"Party Unity My Ass\\", but the PAC was registered as \\"People United Means Action,\\" a backronym. Executive director Darragh Murphy estimates that PUMA PAC proper had gathered over 10,000 members and the organization's official site had received more than a million hits between its founding in June through August 2008. Dianne Mantouvalos, founder of the larger JustSayNoDeal coalition, estimates the coalition comprises over 100 groups, and accounted for more than 10% of the 18,000,000 votes Clinton received in the primaries. Will Bower, a media spokesperson for PUMA and JustSayNoDeal, summarized many of PUMA's objections to the actions of the Democratic Party during the 2008 presidential primaries. PUMA's stated beliefs were that the Democratic Party leadership chose Obama undemocratically despite the desires of Democratic voters, and that Obama was unfairly advantaged by the ruling by the Rules and Bylaws Committee on seating Florida and Michigan delegates. PUMA members pointed to charges that the media directed sexism and misogyny at Clinton during the primary campaign and expressed anger at Democratic Party leaders' failure to speak against it or otherwise respond appropriately. After the primaries, while focusing none of his comments on Obama, Democratic National Committee chair Howard Dean did criticize the media, saying, \\"The media took a very sexist approach to Senator Clinton's campaign\\" in response to hearing objections from what he described as a \\"cross-section of women, from individual voters to powerful politicians and chief executives.\\" Some media and online commentators used the term PUMA to describe any Clinton primary voter who did not support Obama's nomination or the Democratic Party leadership, regardless of PAC affiliation. =Political action= PUMA's protest actions during the 2008 election took several forms, including encouraging a Clinton write-in campaign for the general election, voting for no presidential candidate, and supporting other candidates such as Obama's Republican opponent, Senator John McCain. Some hoped that enough superdelegates would change their minds to give Clinton the nomination at the upcoming Democratic National Convention that August. Other expressed desires were to help defeat Obama in the general election by electing McCain president to set up another run for Clinton in 2012, or that Clinton run as an independent candidate in the election. Some have noted that the Internet fostered the organization. Many PUMA advocates are part of the blogosphere and use it for organization, advocacy and viral communication. PUMA advocated for an open convention in which Clinton's name would be placed in nomination and her delegates allowed to vote for her. The allied organization The Denver Group spearheaded an ad-based media campaign advocating for an open nomination convention including placing Clinton's name in nomination, allowing speeches in support and a roll-call vote. The campaign emphasized a connection between historical events and the 2008 convention, calling on DNC Chairman Howard Dean and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to \\"follow fair and honest application of the democratic process and according to democratic principles\\" and resist turning \\"the convention into a coronation.\\" PAC members were among the groups protesting the 2008 Democratic National Convention. Organizers, co-founders and associated movements Darragh Murphy, executive director of PUMA PAC, created the organization in June 2008, saying that her website's immediate goal was \\"to let the party know, let the leadership know that millions and millions of us are not going to support Obama, that we believe the nomination process was flawed beyond belief, that it was unfair and biased.\\" According to one reporter who interviewed her, \\"Murphy ... believes that the only way to save the Democratic Party at this point was to destroy it. Mr. Obama must lose, and his supporters must be purged.\\" But Murphy had characterized PUMA PAC's goals as \\"not an organized effort to leave the Democratic Party, but to get it back, to bring real unity to the party. Millions of voters are still very unhappy. We're going to still be here on November 5.\\" Diane Mantouvalos, who also founded HireHeels.com, a website trying to involve women in politics, founded \\"Just Say No Deal.com\\" along with Peter Boykin (creator of the slogan for the domain name), Will Bower, Cristi Adkins, Amy Goldman, Anne Franklin, Robin Carlson, and Thuc Ngyuen after Hillary Clinton announced the suspension of her campaign. Just Say No Deal was a coalition of groups, including PUMA, advocating against Obama as the nominee. Clinton supporters including Christi Adkins, Anne Franklin, and Peter Boykin created Clintons4McCain.com. Clintons4McCain's group membership intended to vote for McCain in November 2008, and believed that he would be a tolerable president.Clintons4McCain.com About us Adkins and Franklin were interviewed on Third Rail Radio and Fox News on multiple occasions about PUMA's mission.Member of Clintons for Cristi Adkins, Speaks. Fox News, June 11, 2008. Adkins and Bowers and other PUMAs appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart during the convention. Criticism PUMA has been criticized for its support of Republican candidates John McCain and Sarah Palin, especially considering the sharp policy differences between the Republican ticket and Hillary Clinton; this left the organization open to charges that it supported the McCain campaign solely out of spite or racism, with no concern for whether a McCain victory would actually advance Clinton's policy agenda. Some Democrats argued that the organization's goals contradicted Clinton's stated views, and PUMA's lack of support from Clinton herself undermined its credibility. On CNN's Situation Room, Clinton said, \\"I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that anyone who supported me ... understands what a grave error it would be not to vote for Senator Obama.\\"Clinton: It'd be 'terrible mistake' to pick McCain over Obama May 14, 2008 CNN PUMA suggested that Clinton was not sincere in endorsing Obama, but was simply trying to avoid damage to her position in the party. One Democratic state committeewoman who said she supported Clinton, and whose attitude was \\"Enough with this PUMA stuff,\\" said: \\"It's not like it's 'Rah rah Obama'. No. But he was our candidate....\\" Patti Higgins, the chair of the Alaska Democratic Party, wrote to a PUMA supporter: \\"Having Senator Clinton's name on a roll call without having the votes would just embarrass her, waste time, and make people agonize over nothing. I find it difficult to believe that this organization was not an undercover McCain operation.\\" On August 14, 2008, Clinton and Obama issued a joint news release stating that Clinton's name would be put into nomination and a roll-call vote held at the convention, in response to calls from Clinton supporters. Clinton previously stated at a fundraiser: \\"[I] believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected. I think that was a very big part of how we actually come out unified.\\" Amanda Marcotte of Pandagon had accused PUMA of being a front for McCain advocacy, pointing to Darragh Murphy's financial support of McCain in February 2000. Murphy acknowledged having donated to McCain, stating that the donation was to help him defeat George W. Bush in the primary. She said she voted for Democratic nominee Al Gore in the general election, although she did not donate to his campaign, and said she was \\"devastated when Bush stole the election\\". According to The Huffington Post's Fundrace 2008, Murphy had donated $850 to Clinton's presidential campaign through Q3 2008.Huffington Post Donations Search Fundrace 2008 Marcotte's accusation, however, omits Murphy's campaign contributions to Clinton. FEC records show a $200 donation to WomenCount PAC by Murphy in June 2008. Bower rejects the claims of Marcotte and others: \\"People have been trying to paint this as a Trojan horse, you know, as though I'm a Republican, that this was a Republican strategy ... No, that's not it at all. From dog-catcher to president, I've voted Democrat.\\" Florida Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Clinton supporter, argued that while she saw why many subscribed to the \\"PUMA attitude\\", she argued that for \\"reproductive rights, the economy and a range of other issues, the only choice was Obama\\", and that voting for McCain, or letting him win by default, was worse than not having Clinton as the nominee. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stated that PUMAs and other Clinton supporters \\"have been less than gracious\\" for their continuing refusal to support Obama. DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee co-chair James Roosevelt disputed the claim that the Michigan-Florida delegate decision was in any way preordained to favor Obama. He argued that party rules and regulations were \\"followed and interpreted fairly,\\" saying that there were allegations of impropriety in the Texas caucuses, but only one complaint was filed with a delegate. After McCain's defeat in the general election, some commentators accused PUMA of essentially misrepresenting their influence or numbers, as some exit polls showed that Obama won over 90% of the Democratic vote. Later studies, however, found that between 24% and 25% of voters who supported Clinton in the primary voted for McCain in the general election. Among the anti-PUMA blogs, StupidPumas! was perhaps the least restrained, accusing the group of both overt and covert racism, duplicity, and even fraud. StupidPumas! posted copies of official letters sent to PUMA-PAC from the Federal Election Commission, demanding the filing of long-overdue financial reports. PUMA film In 2009, Los Angeles filmmakers Brad Mays and Lorenda Starfelt finished work on their feature-length political documentary The Audacity of Democracy, which followed the 2008 race for the Democratic presidential nomination and focused in particular on PUMA. Shot from June through September 2008, Mays and Starfelt filmed interviews and political activity in Los Angeles, Princeton, Dallas, Austin, Washington, D.C., Chicago, New York City and at the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver. Mays came under almost immediate fire from pro-Obama groups, citing conflict of interest due to the production having been financed by PUMA-PAC itself. Mays acknowledged these concerns but maintained that his film would be an objective account of what he saw and heard during the primary. About a week before the convention, all of Mays' camera equipment was stolen en route to Chicago. Most of the gear was eventually replaced, but the crucial Chicago shoot was seriously compromised. When Mays decided to film interviews with Internet journalist Tommy Christopher, an outspoken PUMA critic, the rank and file of the PUMA movement quickly denounced the filmmaker, distancing themselves from the entire project. In multiple subsequent Blog-Radio interviews, Mays has expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the finished film, revealing that he had not been allowed to complete shooting in the manner originally agreed to, and adding that many of the PUMA members who had decided to switch their support from Clinton to McCain did not care for the way their newfound Republican leanings played onscreen.

In geographies where it is hard to find providers of good map data, user contributions were used to increase map quality. Changes to Google Map Maker were intended to appear on Google Maps only after sufficient review by Google moderators. Google Map Maker was used at Google Mapathon events held annually. In November 2016, Google announced that Google Map Maker would be retired and merged with Google Maps. Google Map Maker was officially shut down on March 31, 2017. Interface Using the find or browse tools, contributors were able to add and draw features directly onto a map where the borders had already been drawn, and could add features such as roads, railways, rivers and so on. In addition, users could add specific buildings and services onto the map such as local businesses and services. Three kinds of drawing tools were available: placemark (a single point of interest on the map), line (for drawing roads, railways, rivers, and the like) and polygon (for defining boundaries and borders, adding parks, lakes and other large features). The approach encouraged by users and by Google was to trace features such as roads from the existing satellite imagery. This approach was not useful in areas with poor satellite imagery, and users consequently created less map data in those areas. New users' contributions were moderated by more experienced users or reviewers at Google to ensure quality and prevent vandalism. As users made more successful contributions, their edits were less closely monitored and may have been published on the map straight away. Certain larger features may have taken a long time to appear on the map as they were waiting to be rendered by the server. Contributors could assign areas of the map as their 'neighbourhood', that is an area they know well enough to make detailed contributions to. Users could also moderate the contributions of others within their neighbourhood. This information was private; the neighbourhood a user selected was not publicly associated with the users' account. Availability As of 6 March 2016, the service was available in Bangladesh, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, Costa Rica, Croatia, Czech Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark (not including Greenland and the Faroe Islands), Egypt, El Salvador, Estonia, France, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, India, Iran, Iraq, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Macedonia, Malaysia, Mexico, Moldova, Morocco, Nepal, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, the Philippines, Poland, Puerto Rico, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Taiwan, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, the United States, Venezuela, and Vietnam. 2015 vandalism incident In April 2015, Google removed user-created Map Maker content that showed an \\"Android robot urinating on the Apple logo\\" and a separate feature saying \\"Google review policy is crap\\", after they were discovered on Google Maps. Following the \\"large scale prank\\", Google disabled auto-approval and user moderation, and on 8 May, the Map Maker team announced that editing would be temporarily disabled worldwide as of 12 May 2015. Google reenabled the service in six countries in August 2015, with plans to enable in other countries in the following weeks. On 10 August, editing was re-opened to Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, India, the Philippines, and Ukraine; Google relied on regional moderators to review edits as an extra precaution, in addition to automated and human moderation. On 26 August, Google Map Maker re-opened to 45 more countries. Criticism Map Maker required contributors to grant Google a \\"... perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, distribute, and create derivative works of the User Submission\\".Terms of Service for Google Map Maker While Google provided a form to request Map Maker data downloads, it provided no programmatic access to data.

He was the only former US Marine to serve as a Confederate general. Early life Kirkland was born in Hillsborough, Orange County, North Carolina. He was appointed to the United States Military Academy in 1852, but did not graduate. Despite this failure, he was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps in 1855. In 1856 he participated in the Battle of the Barrier Forts. He resigned his commission in 1860. Civil War When the Civil War broke out, Kirkland was initially appointed a captain in the Confederate army and then elected colonel of the 11th North Carolina Volunteers, later designated the 21st North Carolina, in June 1861. He commanded his regiment at First Manassas as part of Brig. Gen Milledge Bonham's brigade, but was not significantly engaged. In October, the 21st North Carolina was attached to Isaac Trimble's brigade and the following spring, he participated in Stonewall Jackson's Shenandoah Valley Campaign. Kirkland was shot through both thighs during the First Battle of Winchester, putting him out of action for several months. During his recuperation, Kirkland served as chief of staff for Patrick Cleburne during the Murfreesboro campaign in December 1862. Kirkland returned to active service with his old regiment at the Battle of Gettysburg, taking part during the fighting on July 1-2. He was promoted to brigadier general on August 31, to rank from August 29, and commanded the former brigade of J. Johnston Pettigrew at the Battle of Bristoe Station, where the ulnar bone of his left arm was fractured by a bullet. He spent the next few months recuperating and in February 1864 returned to duty. He fought in the Battle of the Wilderness and the Battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse before being wounded again at the Battle of Cold Harbor, when he was once again shot in the right thigh. Kirkland was assigned to the command of another brigade in Robert F. Hoke's division the following August. Kirkland served under James Longstreet at Richmond, taking part in the attack on Fort Harrison in October 1864. Transferred to North Carolina in December, Kirkland assisted in the defense of Fort Fisher by forcing back the Federal advance under the command of Benjamin Butler. Later, when the Confederates abandoned the fort and withdrew to Wilmington, he commanded the rear guard and directed events in the fighting at Wise's Fork. He fought at Bentonville and surrendered with Joseph E. Johnston on April 26, 1865 in Durham, North Carolina. After the war, Kirkland settled in Savannah, Georgia, where he worked in the commission business. He later moved to New York City and worked for the post office there. Kirkland spent the last years of his life in a soldier's home in Washington, D.C., where he died of kidney disease on May 12, 1915, and was buried in Elmwood Cemetery in Shepherdstown, West Virginia. Kirkland's daughter Bess became famous on the Broadway stage under the name Odette Tyler. His family home, Ayr Mount, in Hillsborough, NC, is now a house museum.

Designed by William Douglas Lee in the Gothic Revival style, the building opened in 1926 as a center for garment manufacturing. It has since been converted to condominiums. Construction and operation The Textile Center Building was developed by Florence C. Casler, a pioneering woman real estate developer and contractor. When the building was completed, Casler maintained her office there during the height of her career. In April 1926, the Los Angeles Times reported on the building's opening as follows: > \\"More than 6000 people were present at the formal opening of the new Textile > Center Building, the new loft building on the corner of Eighth and Maple, > built and owned by Lloyd & Casler, Inc., and catering exclusively to the > wholesale garment manufacturers of the city.\\" As part of the grand opening, a fashion show was conducted featuring wearing apparel manufactured in Los Angeles. A $400,000 bond offering in May 1927 noted that the Textile Center Building had a total floor area of and was completed in January 2006 at a cost of $626,240.68. It stated that the building was 100% rented to 56 tenants with gross annual income of $92,584 against expenses of $22,394.61, for net earnings of $70,189.39. The building was sold in 1945 for $450,000. Conversion to loft-style condominiums In 2005, the building was converted into loft-style condominiums. Demolition of the building's interior began in January 2005 to make way 64 condominiums and of retail space. The project was part of MJW Investments' $130 million conversion of nine former garment buildings into live/work lofts and retail space. In 2006, the Los Angeles Business Journal reported that the building was \\"being filled with modern loft dwellers seeking an urban lifestyle.\\" Historic designations The Textile Center Building has been recognized as a historic building at both the local and national levels. In April 2002, it was designated a Historic Cultural Monument (No. 712) by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission. And in 2005 it was listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

Standing 35 feet high and supporting four 15-foot blades, the Dutch turret-mill style windmill was constructed by German immigrant Fred Meiss, Jr. and Otto Fiek near Spring Creek. The turret-style allowed the top to be turned so the sails face the wind. The millstones were made in Europe and shipped through the port of Indianola. The stones were capable of grinding 500 pounds of cornmeal a week. The walls of the mill are constructed of wooden logs and covered with shakes.

It was responsible for the Register of the National Estate. Creation and role The Australian Heritage Commission was one of a number of ventures by the Whitlam Labor Government to establish cultural heritage as a more substantial government activity. In his Policy Speech in November, 1972, the Federal Labor leader said that ...one overriding objective of a Labor Government would be 'to preserve and enhance the quality of the National Estate. When the Labor Government came to office in December 1972 a Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate was set up, with terms of reference ...to report on: the nature and state of the National Estate; the measures presently being adopted; the measures which should be adopted; the role which the Australian Government should play in the preservation and enhancement of the National Estate; the manner in which the National Trusts of Australia and other appropriate conservation groups could be supported by public funds and the amount required in order that these bodies can immediately increase their effectiveness, in arguing and working for the preservation and enhancement of the Nation1 Estate. The AHC had a wide gamut, covering natural, indigenous and historical heritage. It was first proposed in the Government-appointed Committee of Inquiry into the National Estate, chaired by Mr Justice R.M. Hope, in April 1973. The Committee reported to Federal Parliament in August 1974 that ...uncontrolled development, economic growth and 'progress' to that time had had a very detrimental effect on Australia's national estate... and called for ...prompt action and public education to prevent further neglect and destruction.1301.0 - Year Book Australia, 1988 An Interim Committee on the National Estate was formed in August 1974 to continue the work of the Inquiry and begin to develop a national policy for the National Estate, based on UNESCO‚Äôs Committee for the Protection of World Cultural and National Heritage, which spoke of an ‚ÄòInternational Estate‚Äô.Ashton, Paul & Jennifer Cornwall, 2006, Corralling Conflict: The Politics Of Australian Federal Heritage Legislation Since The 1970s, Public History Review, Vol 13, 2006, Pp53-65 The Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 was assented to on 19 June 1975. The Commission was a statutory authority, responsible to the Commonwealth Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. Commissioners meet four to six times a year, and with the part-time Chairman and six part-time Commissioners being chosen for their skills and interest in the natural and cultural environment. Standards and criteria In the 1980s and 90s the AHC developed a number of policy documents which became standard heritage practice. Heritage practitioners including Jane Lennon and Michael Pearson were important figures in this process.Canberra Times 10 June 2013 The first meeting of the seven part-time members of AHC chaired by (later Professor) David Yencken, was held on 27 July 1976. A small staff supported the work of the Chairman and Commissioners.Industrial Heritage and the National Estate, Sharon Sullivan, Executive Director, Australian Heritage Commission 1995 A critical component of the Commission was the creation of the Register of the National Estate, which was intended as an inventory of ...those places, being components of the natural environment of Australia or the cultural environment of Australia, that have aesthetic, historic, scientific or social significance or other special value for future generations as well as for the present community.AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION ACT 1975 No. 57 of 1975 - SECT 4 The AHC was an important catalyst to other state and local heritage protection and took on the early role of establishing guidelines, standards and criteria for assessment and managing places of heritage significance. An example was the development of the Australian Historic Themes for use by heritage professionals at the national level, as a means for co-ordinating research and significance assessments.AUSTRALIAN HISTORIC THEMES A framework for use in heritage assessment and management AUSTRALIAN HERITAGE COMMISSION 2001 The Commission also established criteria for the assessment of places on the Register of the National Estate, which have been subsequently adapted and adopted by most State and community heritage organisation.Identification, Assessment and Protection of National Estate Values Southern NSW CRA Region Demise Formed just as the Fraser Liberal-Country coalition government came into power, the AHC came under criticism from mining and development lobbies, and the Commonwealth Government itself over issues such as the Ranger Uranium Mine in Kakadu, and the Gordon-below-Franklin dam proposal which had been placed on the World Heritage List in 1983.

Early History The windmill was built in 1809 and was added to the National Historic Register in 1978. See also: Still retaining its internal machinery, this windmill is unusual for Long Island, in that it has a fantail to turn the sails into the wind. The Hayground Windmill, in 1984, was one of eleven surviving 18th and early 19th century wind-powered gristmills on Long Island It was also the busiest, turning out more bushels than nearby windmills. Open seasonally, it operated 4 months of the year, turning out in 1870 800 bushels of wheat, 800 of oats and 400 of corn. It was in Haye Ground, an early part of Bridgehampton on the main Montauk Highway going to Watermill. The Hayground Windmill stood on the old triangular commons at the center of the village of Hayground, midway between Bridgehampton and Water Hill. This was the only mill in Hayground through the 19th century and serviced the village and surrounding countryside. The mill operated into the 20th century; by 1912 it was grinding just corn and feed during the summer months-. In its last year of operation(1919) the Hayground Mill was the only windmill on Long Island still running. After 1919 the mill was used variously as a tea room and artist's studio. In 1950 Robert Dowling purchased the windmill and moved it to his estate on the dunes in East Hampton where it was a decorative motif.New York Times, March 28th,1950, page47, Dowling buys old windmill 1950's move In 1950 it was purchased by Robert Dowling and he moved it to his estate on the dunes by ox cart.

As a fervently abolitionist and strongly Republican state, Maine contributed a higher proportion of its citizens to the Union armies than any other, as well as supplying extensive equipment and stores. Although no land battles were fought in Maine, the Battle of Portland Harbor (1863) saw a southern raiding party thwarted in its attempt to capture a revenue cutter. Abraham Lincoln chose Maine's Hannibal Hamlin as his first Vice President. The future General Joshua L. Chamberlain and the 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment played a key role at the Battle of Gettysburg, and the 1st Maine Heavy Artillery Regiment lost more men in a single charge during the Siege of Petersburg than any Union regiment in the war. Maine's contributions Maine was so eager for the cause that it ended up contributing a larger number of combatants, in proportion to its population than any other Union state.Whitman & True, p. 21. About 80,000 men from Maine served in the U.S. military as soldiers and sailors. They were organized into 32 infantry and two cavalry regiments, and seven light artillery batteries and one heavy artillery regiment. Hundreds of civilians served as nurses, doctors, relief workers, and agents at home and on the field of battle. Many served in the United States Sanitary Commission or United States Christian Commission, as well as similar organizations.Maine Civil War Trails Retrieved 2008-10-13 According to a letter by Walter Stone Poor, a Union soldier from Maine, his reason for fighting for the Union in the war was to end slavery, a cause he stated he would gladly give his life for: =The homefront= During the early part of the war, several vocal abolitionist organizations kept the issue of slavery in the public eye. Newspaper editors informed the populace of the conduct and outcome of the war efforts. Maine factories produced ships, naval stores, and supplies, army equipment, tents, etc. Thomas Lincoln Casey oversaw the state's coastal fortifications including forts McClary and Preble. He completed the massive Fort Knox on the Penobscot River. No Civil War land battles were fought in Maine, but anti-Confederate passions were inflamed in June 1863 when Southern raiders triggered the Battle of Portland Harbor after seizing a revenue cutter and trying to escape to the ocean.Harper's Weekly, July 11, 1863. Notable leaders from Maine =Political= Hannibal Hamlin of Paris, Maine, was Lincoln's vice-president during his first term. A strong orator and opponent of slavery, he urged both the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation and the arming of African Americans. He became aligned with Radical Republicans, which may have caused him to be dropped from the ticket in 1864.Biography at Mr. Lincoln's White House Retrieved 2008-10-13. Augusta newspaperman and U.S. Congressman James G. Blaine was a powerful voice on Capitol Hill and dominated post-war politics during the Reconstruction period. The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was substantially Blaine's proposition, and later he was the 1884 Republican nominee for President. =Union Army= More than two dozen men from Maine served in the Union army as generals, and dozens more Mainers led brigades at one time or another as colonels. The highest- ranking officer was Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard of Leeds, who commanded the XI Corps in several major battles, including Chancellorsville and Gettysburg. He had lost an arm at the Battle of Seven Pines during the 1862 Peninsula Campaign. In the fall of 1863, Howard and his corps were transferred to the Western Theater to join the Army of the Cumberland in Tennessee. In the Battle of Chattanooga, Howard's corps helped capture Missionary Ridge and force the retreat of Gen. Braxton Bragg. In July 1864, Howard became commander of the Army of the Tennessee and fought in the Atlanta Campaign. He led the right wing of Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman's forces in the famous March to the Sea and the subsequent Carolinas Campaign.Cimbala, Paul A., \\"Oliver Otis Howard\\", Encyclopedia of the American Civil War: A Political, Social, and Military History, Heidler, David S., and Heidler, Jeanne T., eds., W.

His subordinate officers, including Ellis Spear and Holman S. Melcher, and the men of the 20th Maine successfully repulsed a series of charges made by Alabama troops of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia. Earlier in the war, the 20th had been led by Adelbert Ames of Rockland. The son of a sea captain, Ames rose at Gettysburg to command of a division. He led the successful assault in the Second Battle of Fort Fisher (commanding the 2nd Division, XXIV Corps), accompanying his men into the formidable coastal fortress as most of his staff were shot down by Confederate snipers.Budiansky, Stephen, The Bloody Shirt: Terror After Appomattox, Viking Adult, 2008, . p. 65. Other notable generals from Maine included George Lafayette Beal of Norway, who led a brigade in the Red River Campaign and the Valley Campaigns of 1864. He was promoted to general for gallant service at the Battle of Cedar Creek, where his brigade broke the Confederate lines during the turning point of the battle. Hiram Berry of Rockland was killed at Chancellorsville while leading his 2nd Division of the III Corps in a bayonet charge. James G. Blunt, a fiery abolitionist born in Trenton, won a victory at the Battle of Honey Springs, bringing much of the Indian Territory into Union control. In 1864, Blunt's division inflicted the final defeat to Sterling Price at the Second Battle of Newtonia, ending Price's Missouri Raid.

Condon While serving as Attorney General for South Carolina, Condon argued as respondent in the case Reno v. Condon. Congress enacted the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994 (DPPA), which establishes a regulatory scheme that restricts the States' ability to disclose a driver's personal information without the driver's consent, after finding that many States sell such information. The DPPA conflicts with South Carolina law, under which information contained in the State's DMV records is available to any person or entity that fills out a form listing the requester's name and address and stating that the information will not be used for telephone solicitation. The Attorney General of South Carolina filed suit, alleging the DPPA violated the Tenth and Eleventh Amendments. After success in District court and Appeals Court, the suit wound up in front of the Supreme Court. Condon was successful in the Appeals Court which ruled that Congress was stepping illegally into state territory and noted further that there exists no constitutional right to privacy in information contained in public records. South Carolina Attorney General Charlie Condon, when hearing that the Supreme Court agreement to hear the case, said he believed citizens have a right to keep their privacy protected‚Äîwhich he says is guaranteed by a clause in the South Carolina Constitution. But the real question is who should be enforcing that protection Condon said. Condon and other state officials strongly believe that states should have full autonomy when it comes to administering public records. In the case before the Supreme Court, South Carolina will argue that the new federal law violates the 10th Amendment.http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9905/21/license.priv.idg/ \\"The people of Carolina established drivers' records, maintained them, and have a right to determine their use,\\" he said in a statement. \\"South Carolina should be run by South Carolinians.

The Declaration and Constitution were ratified by popular vote in July 1793, and officially adopted on 10 August; however, they never went into effect, and the constitution was officially suspended on 10 October. It is unclear whether this suspension was thought to affect the Declaration as well. The Declaration was written by the commission that included Louis Antoine L√©on de Saint-Just and Marie-Jean H√©rault de S√©chelles during the period of the French Revolution. The main distinction between the Declaration of 1793 and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789 is its egalitarian tendency: equality is the prevailing right in this declaration. The 1793 version included new rights, and revisions to prior ones: to work, to public assistance, to education, and to resist oppression. The text was mainly written by H√©rault de S√©chelles, whose style and writing can be found on most of the documents of the commission that also wrote the French Constitution of 1793 (\\"Constitution of the Year I\\") that was never implemented. The first project of the Constitution of the French Fourth Republic also referred to the 1793 version of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen. The 1793 document was written by Jacobins after they had expelled the Girondists. It was a compromise designed as a propaganda weapon and did not fully reflect the radicalism of the Jacobin leaders. It was never put in force.Louis R. Gottschalk, The Era of the French Revolution (1929) pp. 236‚Äì38 Equality as the first natural right of man Equality is the most important aspect of the Declaration of 1793. In its second article, equality is the first right mentioned (followed by liberty, security, and property). In Article 3 states \\"All men are equal by nature and before the law\\". As such, for the authors of this declaration equality is not only before the law but it is also a natural right, that is to say, a fact of nature. There was already at that time a school of thought that stated that liberty and equality can quickly become contradictory: indeed liberty doesn't solve social inequalities since there exist some natural inequalities (of talent, intelligence, etc.). That school of thought considered that the government had only to protect liberty and to only proclaim natural equality, and eventually liberty would prevail over social equality since all people have different talents and abilities and are free to exercise them. The question raised by this declaration is how to solve social inequalities. Article 21 states that every citizen has a right to public help, that society is indebted to each citizen and therefore has the duty to help them. Citizens have there a right to work and society has a duty to provide relief to those who cannot work. Article 22 declares a right to education. These rights are considered \\"2nd generation rights of Man\\", economic and social rights (the first ones would be natural or political). These rights entail a greater government intervention in order to reach society's goal, stated in article 1: common welfare. The protections of Liberty Individual liberty is still a primary right and some aspects are more precisely defined than in Declaration of 1789. The declaration explicitly states the freedom of religion, of assembly, and of the press (article 7), of commerce (article 17), of petition (article 32). Slavery is prohibited by article 18 which states \\"Every man can contract his services and his time, but he cannot sell himself nor be sold: his person is not an alienable property.\\" The protections of the citizens against their own government If in a way, this declaration has a more liberal bent in the modern American sense, since it states that there ought to be public policies for the general welfare, it also contains some very strong libertarian aspects. Article 7 states \\"The necessity of enunciating these rights supposes either the presence or the fresh recollection of despotism.\\" Article 9: \\"The law ought to protect public and personal liberty against the oppression of those who govern.\\" Article 33 states that resisting tyranny is a logical consequence of the rights of man: \\"Resistance to oppression is the consequence of the other rights of man\\". Article 34 states that if one is oppressed, everyone is. Article 27 states \\"Let any person who may usurp the sovereignty be instantly put to death by free men.\\" Though the usurpation of sovereignty is not detailed, sovereignty is explained in article 25 as residing \\"in the people\\". There is no doubt that this way of thinking deeply influenced the revolutionary government during the Terror. Finally, article 35 states \\"When the government violates the rights of the people, insurrection is for the people and for each portion of the people the most sacred of rights and the most indispensable of duties.\\" Though this declaration was never enforced (like the Constitution of 1793), history has shown that the French people have followed this advice with many successful (1830, 1848) and unsuccessful (1832, 1870) revolutions throughout the 19th century.

Several Connecticut politicians played significant roles in the Federal government and helped shape its policies during the war and the subsequent Reconstruction. Connecticut at the beginning of the war Before the Civil War, Connecticut residents such as Leonard Bacon, Simeon Baldwin, Horace Bushnell, Prudence Crandall, Jonathan Edwards (the younger) and Harriet Beecher Stowe, were active in the abolitionist movement,Connecticut Abolitionism, Connecticuthistory.org a CThumanities Program and towns such as FarmingtonUnderground railroad, Connecticut Freedom Trail and Amistad sites tour in Farmington and Middletown were stops along the Underground Railroad.Warner, Elizabeth, A Pictoral History of Middletown. Norfolk, Virginia: Greater Middletown Preservation Trust, Donning Publishers, 1990. Slavery in Connecticut had been gradually phased out beginning in 1797 with less than 100 slaves in Connecticut by 1820; slavery was not completely outlawed, however, until 1848.Timeline of Connecticut Slavery The state, along with the rest of New England, had voted for Republican presidential candidate John C. Fr√©mont in the 1856 presidential election, giving \\"the Pathfinder\\" all 6 electoral votes. The Republicans opposed the extension of slavery into the territories, and Connecticut residents embraced their slogan \\"Free speech, free press, free soil, free men, Fr√©mont and victory!\\"1856 election results Four years later, once again Connecticut favored the Republican candidate, this time Illinois lawyer Abraham Lincoln. Residents cast 58.1% of their ballots for Lincoln, versus 20.6% for Northern Democrat Stephen Douglas and 19.2% for Southern Democrat John C. Breckinridge. A handful of voters (1,528 or 2% of the ballots cast) favored John Bell of Tennessee. The 1860 U.S. Census enumerated 460,147 people living in Connecticut as of June 1 of that year. Of that count, 451,504 were white, with only 8,627 blacks and 16 Indians. More than 80,000 of the whites were foreign-born, with 55,000 coming from Ireland. More than 20% of the population was still engaged in farming, but industry and the trades had become major employers.U.S. Census of 1860. Starting in the 1830s, and accelerating when Connecticut abolished slavery entirely in 1848, African Americans from in- and out-of-state began relocating to urban centers for employment and opportunity, forming new neighborhoods such as Bridgeport's Little Liberia. War efforts Governor William Buckingham was a wealthy businessman and energetic Republican; he won a narrow election in April 1860, as a moderate Republican who was temperamentally cautious. His anti-slavery attitude hardened as the war went on. Even before Fort Sumter, he collaborated with fellow Republican governors in New England, and alerted the state militia to watch out for sabotage. The state specialized in machinery, and had a strong reputation for making artillery and firearms. The opposition party, the Democrats, were largely dominated by the antiwar or peace element, led by former governor Thomas H. Seymour. When Lincoln called for troops the day after Fort Sumter, Buckingham mobilized militia units, but had no state authority for financing the war. The legislature was not in session, but the banks eagerly volunteered to loan money to the state until the Legislature made good.Richard F. Miller, ed., States at War: volume 1 (2013) pp 52-57 =Military recruitment and participation= Following the bombardment of Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor in April 1861, a few days later, on the 15th, President Lincoln called for volunteers to join the new Union army. The next day, Governor William A. Buckingham, like Lincoln a Republican, issued a proclamation urging his citizens to join state-sponsored regiments and artillery batteries.Buckingham, Samuel G., The Life of William A. Buckingham. Springfield, Massachusetts: W. F. Adams Co., 1894. In response, by the end of the month, the 1st Connecticut Infantry and two other regiments had been raised and recruited for a term of three months (all the time that was expected to be needed to crush the rebellion and end the war). Daniel Tyler of Brooklyn was selected as the 1st Regiment's initial colonel, and the regiment arrived in Washington, D.C. on May 10.Connecticut Military Department The state furnished thirty full regiments of infantry, including two that were made up of black men. Two regiments of heavy artillery also served as infantry toward the end of the war. Connecticut also supplied three batteries of light artillery and one regiment of cavalry.Civil War Archive Retrieved 2008-10-06.Dyer's Compendium. Fort Trumbull in New London served as an organizational center for Union troops and headquarters for the U.S. 14th Infantry Regiment. Here, troops were recruited and trained before being sent to war.History of Fort Trumbull Among the regiments trained there was the 14th Connecticut Infantry, which played a prominent role in the Army of the Potomac's defense of Cemetery Ridge during the Battle of Gettysburg.Stevens, Rev. Henry S., Late Chaplain of the Fourteenth Connecticut Volunteers, 14th Regiment C.V. Infantry. The 2nd Connecticut Heavy Artillery (19th Connecticut Infantry) suffered significant casualties in the 1864 Overland Campaign and the Siege of Petersburg. Among the troops from the \\"Nutmeg State\\" that fought in the Trans-Mississippi Theater was the 9th Connecticut Infantry, which aided in the capture of New Orleans, Louisiana, as part of the \\"New England Brigade.\\" During the war, the State Hospital in New Haven (a precursor to Yale-New Haven Hospital) was leased to the government to serve as the Knight U.S. Army General Hospital. 23,340 soldiers were treated in the hospital with only 185 deaths. One of the first officers killed in the Civil War was New Haven's Theodore Winthrop, who died in an early engagement at Big Bethel in western Virginia. Casualties from Connecticut military units during the war included 97 officers and 1094 enlisted men killed in action, with another 700 men dying from wounds while more than 3,000 perished from disease. Twenty- seven men were executed for crimes, including desertion. More than 400 men were reported as missing; the majority were likely held by the Confederate Army as prisoners of war.Croffut & Morris, p. 852. =The homefront= Prominent among military manufacturers with Connecticut ties was the New Haven Arms Company, which provided the army with the Henry rifle, developed by New Haven's Benjamin Tyler Henry.Winchester 1860 Henry Rifle Colt's Manufacturing Company, founded and owned by Hartford-born industrialist Samuel Colt, was another significant arms and munitions supplier. The company shipped large quantities of sidearms to the Union Navy.Colt 1861 Navy Model The Hartford- based firm of Pratt & Whitney provided machinery and support equipment to Army contractors to produce weapons. Most of the brass buttons used on Federal uniforms, belt buckles and other fittings, were made in Waterbury, the \\"Brass City\\", notably by the Chase Brass and Copper Company.Chase Copper & Brass website and history The shipyards at Mystic provided ships for the Union Navy. The USS Monticello (1859), USS Galena (1862), USS Varuna (1861) were all built at Mystic. The popular late war marching song Marching Through Georgia was written by Henry Clay Work, a Middletown resident.H. C. Work biography at pdmusic.org Notable leaders from Connecticut Nathaniel Lyon, lithograph possibly depicting the Battle of Wilson's Creek. Glastonbury native Gideon Welles was a prominent member of the Lincoln Cabinet and perhaps its leading conservative. He was the Secretary of the Navy from 1861 to 1869 and was the architect of the planning and execution of the blockade of Southern ports. During his tenure, he increased the size of the United States Navy tenfold.Mr. Lincoln's White House: Gideon Welles Shortly after the war began, Col. Daniel Tyler of the 1st Connecticut was promoted to brigadier general. Later, other field officers in Connecticut regiments such as Alfred Terry, Henry Warner Birge (both born in Hartford), and Robert O. Tyler of the 4th Connecticut Infantry would be raised in rank to general. Some Connecticut-born men with antebellum U.S. Army service also became leading generals early in the war, including Ashford-born Nathaniel Lyon, one of the war's earliest army commanders to be killed when he was shot down at the Battle of Wilson's Creek in Missouri. Cornwall's John Sedgwick commanded the Union VI Corps for much of the war until killed at the Spotsylvania Court House. He was succeeded by Horatio G. Wright of Clinton, a long-time officer in the Regular Army.Croffut & Morris, pp. 850-51. Major General Joseph K. Mansfield of Middletown led the II Corps of the Union Army of the Potomac during the middle of 1862. He was killed in action at the Battle of Antietam during the 1862 Maryland Campaign.Eicher, p. 363. Another casualty of the fighting at Antietam was Brig. Gen. George Taylor, who had been educated at a private military academy in Middletown. Joseph R. Hawley of New Haven commanded a division in the Army of the Potomac during the Siege of Petersburg and was promoted in September 1864 to brigadier general. Concerned over keeping the peace during the November elections, Hawley commanded a hand-picked brigade shipped to New York City to safeguard the election process. Other Union generals with Connecticut roots included Henry W. Benham of Meriden, Luther P. Bradley of New Haven, William T. Clark of Norwich, Orris S. Ferry of Bethel, and Alpheus S. Williams of Deep River.

At the start of the Civil War, modern-day Idaho was part of the Washington Territory. On March 3, 1863, the Idaho Territory was formed, consisting of the entirety of modern-day Idaho, Montana, and all but southwest Wyoming. However, there were concerns about Confederate sympathizers in the eastern half of the territory, in what is present-day Montana. As a result, in 1863 Sidney Edgerton traveled quickly to see President Abraham Lincoln about the situation; this was one reason to split the Montana Territory from the Idaho Territory. The split also resulted in most of Idaho Territory's land consisting of modern-day Wyoming being reassigned to the Dakota Territory.Sargent, Tom. The Commanding Officers in Montana, The Civil War in Montana. Virginia City Preservation Alliance, 1999. Volunteer soldiers who served in Idaho did not fight against the Confederacy, but instead monitored traffic along the Oregon Trail and protected communications routes between the western and eastern United States. Fort Boise, at the site of the city of Boise was founded on July 3, 1863. Old Fort Boise near the present day city of Parma was a French post (thus where the name Boise comes from) and was built in 1834. it became one with the Snake River in 1854, and although the French began to rebuild, they later abandoned it. Many people are confused by the two forts of the same name. Gold had been found at Orofino and Florence, Idaho that brought trouble with the friendly Nez Perce tribe. Camp Lapwai‚Äîlater Fort Lapwai‚Äîwas established to keep the peace between the Indians and the miners. The Bear River massacre took place on January 29, 1863, on what was thought to be the boundary of Washington Territory and Utah Territory near the present-day city of Preston in Franklin County, Idaho. On that date, 300 soldiers of the 3rd California Volunteer Infantry Regiment led by Colonel Patrick Connor slaughtered an encampment of at least 250 members of the Shoshone tribe; only about twenty Shoshone men survived. This was in response to numerous attacks against white settlers in the previous year which were blamed on the Shoshone. The incident saw little coverage outside California and Utah, as most major newspapers were concerned with news of the main war fronts. The Bear River Massacre Site is currently a National Historic Landmark.Bearss, Edwin. Bear River Battleground (National Park Service, 1990) pg. 8.2Bear River Massacre at Boa Ogoi, Idaho (American Civil War.com)Heidler, David. Encyclopedia of the American Civil War (W. W. Norton & Company, 2002) pg. 485 There were some Southerners in the territory at the time. Most had originally gone to California, and came to Idaho to pursue gold mining.Dunn, Jacob, Indiana and Indianans (The American historical society, 1919) pg. 1166 In the early part of the Civil War, Oregon and California Volunteer patrols had several clashes with the Paiute, Bannock and Shoshone bands in Oregon and the Territories of Washington (later Idaho), Utah, and Nevada collectively known as the Snake Indians. However the invasion of their territory by miners in 1863, to places like Silver City, brought on the Snake War. The Volunteers fought the Snakes until relieved by Federal troops in late 1865; the war continued until 1868. After the Civil War, Idaho attracted many veterans of the Union Army to the state, including several governors. An Idaho Soldiers Home was constructed during the 1890s. In the 20th century, the deaths of veterans routinely made the news. The last Civil War veteran to die in Idaho was Israel Broadsword in 1952.House, Rod.

New York was the most populous state in the Union during the Civil War, and provided more troops to the Union Army than any other state, as well as several significant military commanders and leaders.Phisterer, p. 88. The Empire State was politically divided, with a significant peace movement, particularly in the mid- to late-war years, as well as being a strong bastion of Radical Republicans who favored harsh treatment of the rebelling Confederate States of America. New York provided a key member of the Lincoln Administration, as well as several important voices on Capitol Hill. The press and media of the state, heavily concentrated in New York City, influenced not only state politics and the public's view on the war, but helped shape and mold national opinion as well. Important periodicals based in New York included The New York Times, New York Tribune, Harper's Weekly, Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper, and others. German-born illustrator Thomas Nast was among the early political cartoonists.Virginia Civil War Archive In the decades after the war ended, numerous memorials and monuments were erected across the Empire State to commemorate specific regiments, units, and officers associated with the war effort. Several archives and repositories, as well as historical societies, hold archives and collections of relics and artifacts. Military recruitment Upstate New York was among the leaders in the revolutions in transportation, agriculture, and industry. Turnpikes, canals (notably the Erie Canal), and railroads connected eastern cities with western markets. New York's farmland was some of the most productive in the nation. The Genesee country became known as the breadbasket of the nation for its extraordinary grain production. Rapid-flowing rivers offered power for major industrial sites. Following these expanding economic opportunities, people (including African Americans as well as European Americans of many different backgrounds) poured into upstate New York. They came from several different cultures‚ÄîNew England Yankees, Dutch and Yorkers from eastern New York, Germans and Scots Irish from Pennsylvania, and immigrants from England and Ireland.Bruegel, Martin, Farm, Shop, Landing: The Rise of a Market Society in the Hudson Valley, 1780-1860, 2002. The New York Seventh Militia in Washington, DC, 1861New York provided 400,000‚Äì460,000 men during the war, nearly 21% of all the men in the state and more than half of those under the age of 30. Of the total enlistment, more than 130,000 were foreign-born, including 20,000 from British North American possessions such as Canada. 51,000 were Irish and 37,000 German. The average age of the New York soldiers was 25 years, 7 months, although many younger men and boys may have lied about their age in order to enlist.Phisterer, p. 47-48. By the time the Civil War ended in 1865, New York had provided the Union Army with 27 regiments of cavalry, 15 regiments of artillery, 8 of engineers, and 248 of infantry.Phisterer, pp. 53-54. Federal records indicate 4,125 free blacks from New York served in the Union Army, and three full regiments of United States Colored Troops were raised and organized in the Empire State--the 20th, 26th, and 31st USCT.Phisterer, p. 43. Among the more prominent military units from the state of New York was the Excelsior Brigade of controversial former congressman Daniel Sickles.Tagg, Larry, The Generals of Gettysburg. Francis B. Spinola was commissioner of New York Harbor when the war erupted; he joined the volunteer army in a New York regiment and was commissioned as an officer, appointed brigadier general of Volunteers, and recruited and organized a brigade of four regiments, known as Spinola's Empire Brigade. Several early volunteer regiments traced their origins to antebellum New York State Militia regiments, including the 14th Brooklyn, which became known for its bright red chasseur-style pants.14th Brooklyn short history . The first organized unit to leave the state for the front lines was the 7th New York State Militia, which departed by train for Washington, D.C. on April 19, 1861. The 11th New York Infantry, a two-years' regiment of new recruits, departed ten days later.Phisterer, p. 54. Among the earliest casualties of the Civil War was Malta, New York, native Col. Elmer E. Ellsworth, who was killed in May 1861 during an armed encounter in Alexandria, Virginia. Supporting the war effort New York had long played an important role in the U.S. military, with the United States Military Academy in West Point providing a significant number of officers to the antebellum Regular Army. New York Harbor was ringed with several military outposts, forts, and garrisons, and many officers who were prominent during the war had spent considerable time in New York before the conflict erupted in early 1861. MacDougall Hospital at Fort Schuyler would become a leading wartime military hospital,See: a \\"post history\\" for Fort Schuyler on NARA microfilm M903 reel 4; Brooklyn Eagle, October 22, 1863, p. 3; and History of Fort Schuyler, http://us.geocities.com/twentiethnyva/schuyler. and Davids' Island was a significant prisoner-of-war camp for captured Confederates. Railroad bridge at Albany used by troop trains during the Civil WarSeveral wealthy New York industrialists played crucial roles in supporting the war effort through materiel, weapons, ammunition, supplies, and accoutrements. Railroad impresario Cornelius Vanderbilt used his growing network of rail systems to effectively move large quantities of troops through the state to staging and training areas.Renahan, Edward, Commodore: The Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt, New York: Basic Books, 2007. The Union Navy contracted with U.S. Congressman Erastus Corning's iron works to manufacture parts and materials for the USS Monitor, the Navy's first ironclad warship. The Brooklyn Navy Yard was an important shipbuilding and naval maintenance concern. Foundrymen Robert Parrott and his brother Peter produced significant quantities of artillery pieces and munitions, and their Parrott rifle, an innovative rifled gun, was manufactured in several sizes at the West Point Foundry.Putnam County Recorder article on Parrott The National Arms Company in Brooklyn produced firearms, including large quantities of revolvers. Other important producers of weaponry and munitions were the Federal government's Watervliet Arsenal and the privately owned Remington Arms Company of Ilion.Remington Arms Company's website Wartime politics Henry RaymondIn the presidential election of 1860, 362,646 (53.7%) New York voters chose Abraham Lincoln, with 312,510 (46.3%) supporting Democrat Stephen Douglas. Powerful New York politicians played important roles in setting national policy and procedures during the war. Roscoe Conkling was among the leading Radical Republicans who strongly supported the vigorous prosecution of the war. They were opposed by moderate Republicans including Henry Jarvis Raymond, a New York newspaperman who served as the Chairman of the Republican National Committee in the latter half of the war. William H. Seward, a United States Senator from New York and an outspoken critic of Lincoln, became the Secretary of State and an important member of Lincoln's Cabinet.Goodwin, Doris Kearns, Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln (2005) . By contrast, the colorful mayor of New York City, Fernando Wood, was a prominent early supporter of the Confederate cause. He argued unsuccessfully that the city should secede from the Union as a separate entity. New York City had many economic and financial ties to the South; by 1820, half of its exports were related to cotton, and upstate textile mills processed Southern cotton. In addition, the numerous immigrants in New York worried that freeing slaves would bring more labor competition to a market where they struggled over the lowest-paid jobs. When the war began, former New York Governor Horatio Seymour took a cautious middle position within his Democratic Party, supporting the war effort but criticizing its conduct by the Lincoln administration. Seymour was especially critical of Lincoln's wartime centralization of power and restrictions on civil liberties, as well as his support of emancipation. In 1862, Seymour was again elected governor, defeating Republican candidate James S. Wadsworth. As governor of the Union's largest state, Seymour was the most prominent Democratic opponent of the President for the next two years. He strongly opposed the Lincoln administration's institution of the military draft in 1863. Alfred Ely, Chairman of the House Committee on Invalid Pensions, was among the first U.S. representatives to be captured by the Confederate Army when he and other civilian onlookers were taken prisoner following the First Battle of Bull Run. He spent six months in a Confederate prison before being exchanged and released. Retrieved on 2008-08-05 Hamilton Fish In 1861 and 1862, former U.S. Senator Hamilton Fish became associated with John A. Dix, William M. Evarts, William E. Dodge, A.T. Stewart, John Jacob Astor, and other New York men on the Union Defence Committee. They cooperated with the New York City government in the raising and equipping troops, and disbursed more than $1 million for the relief of New York volunteers and their families. Later in the war, several leading New York politicians and businessmen helped found the Union League, a pro-Union, pro-Lincoln organization that helped fund the Republican Party, as well as charitable relief groups such as the United States Sanitary Commission.Lawson, Melinda, \\"The Civil War Union Leagues and the Construction of a New National Patriotism\\" Civil War History Volume 48, Issue 4, 2002. pp. 338+. During the Gettysburg Campaign of 1863, despite his sharp political differences with Pennsylvania's Republican Governor Andrew G. Curtin, Governor Seymour dispatched significant quantities of New York State Militia to Harrisburg to help repel the invasion of Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia.New York Times website The first Union soldier killed on Pennsylvania soil was a native Pennsylvanian, Corporal William H. Rihl serving in a company assigned to the 1st New York Cavalry.Pennsylvania webpage on Corporal Rihl's death =Lingering effects of the New York Draft Riots= During the draft riots of July 1863, 120 civilians were killed and 2,000 men injured. The draft riots also resulted in about $1,000,000 in property damage. This was also coupled with a strong anti-war movement sparked by Copperheads and other Peace Democrats, made New York one of the closest contested states in the presidential election of 1864. 368,735 (50.46%) New Yorkers chose the incumbent Abraham Lincoln, with 361,986 (49.54%) supporting Democrat challenger and former army commander George B. McClellan. Lincoln captured all 33 electoral votes. The New York Legislature oversaw the approval of funding the state's war effort, including bounties, fees, expenses, interest on loans, and for the support of the families of soldiers where needed. Total expenditures exceeded $152 million during the war.Phisterer, pp. 83-84. Military actions Monument to New York's \\"Tammany Regiment\\" at Gettysburg No Civil War battles were fought within the Empire State, although Confederate agents did set several fires in New York City as an act intended to terrorize the community and build support for the peace movement.The New Yorker, 25 August 1934 New York troops were prominent in virtually every major battle in the Eastern Theater, and some New York units participated in leading campaigns in the Western Theater, albeit in significantly smaller numbers than in the East. New Yorker John Schofield rose to command of the Army of the Ohio and won the Battle of Franklin, dealing a serious blow to Confederate hopes in Tennessee. More than 27,000 New Yorkers fought in the war's bloodiest battle, the three-day Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Nearly 1,000 men - 989 soldiers were killed in action, with 4,023 wounded (many of whom died of wounds or disease in the months following the battle). 1,761 New Yorkers were taken as prisoners of war, and many were transported to Southern prisons in Richmond, Virginia and elsewhere. It was the largest number of casualties for New York troops in any battle.New York at Gettysburg, p. 108. Among the scores of officers from New York to die at Gettysburg was Brig. Gen. Samuel K. Zook, a long-time resident of New York City.Gambone, A. M., \\"...if tomorrow night finds me dead...\\" The Life of General Samuel K. Zook (Army of the Potomac), Butternut and Blue, 1996, . Col. Patrick \\"Paddy\\" O'Rourke of Rochester died a hero while leading the 140th New York Infantry into action on Little Round Top.Biography from the Gettysburg National Park website Col. Augustus van Horne Ellis was killed near Devil's Den on July 2; he was later memorialized with the only full-sized statue of a regimental commander to be erected on the battlefield.Hawthorne, Frederick, Gettysburg: Stories of Men and Monuments (1988). During the entire war, New York provided more than 370,000 soldiers to the Union armies. Of these, 834 officers were killed in action, as well as 12,142 enlisted men. Another 7,235 officers and men perished from their wounds, and 27,855 died from disease. Another 5,766 were estimated to have perished while incarcerated in Southern prisoner-of-war camps. New York City New York City, the most populous in the United States, was a bustling city that provided a major source of troops, supplies, and equipment for the Union Army. Powerful city politicians and newspaper editors helped shape public opinion towards the war effort and the policies of President Lincoln. The port of New York served as fertile recruiting grounds for the Army as immigrants from Europe (primarily Irish and Germans) at times stepped off the oceanic transports and into the muster rolls. Recruiters such as Michael Corcoran filled muster rolls with thousands of immigrants in response to Lincoln's initial call for 75,000 volunteers from New York.The Wild Geese Today. Politically, the city was dominated by Democrats, many of whom were under the control of a political machine known as Tammany Hall. Led by William \\"Boss\\" Tweed, they gained numerous offices in New York City, and even to the state legislature and judges' seats, often through illegal means. From 1860 to 1870, Tweed controlled most Democratic nominations in the city, while Republicans tended to be more prevalent in upstate New York. =Draft Riots= The draft riots were marked by clashes between angry mobs and Union soldiers The city's strong commercial ties to the South, its growing immigrant population, and anger about conscription led to divided sympathy for both the Union and Confederacy, culminating in the Draft Riots of 1863, one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American history. The week of July 11 to July 16, 1863, was known at the time as \\"Draft Week\\". Barnes 5 Residents, mainly Irish immigrants, were upset with new laws passed by Congress to draft men to fight on what they viewed was the unpopular Civil War. The ensuing disturbances were the largest civil insurrection in American history apart from the Civil War.Foner, E. (1988). Reconstruction America's unfinished revolution, 1863-1877. The New American Nation series. Page 32. New York: Harper & Row. President Lincoln sent several regiments of militia and federal troops to control the city. Irish rioters numbered in the thousands and began rampaging through the streets of New York, attacking blacks and burning whatever building that either belonged to the wealthy or was sympathetic to the Union cause. Smaller-scale riots erupted in other cities throughout the North, including in other places in New York State, at about the same time.Ohio Historical Marker #3-38: Holmes County, Ohio, Draft Riots Draft protests occurred in scores of towns, but few reached the stage of a riot, and none approached New York City in magnitude or damages. The exact death toll during the New York Draft Riots is unknown, but according to historian James M. McPherson (2001), at least 120 civilians were killed.McPherson, James M Ordeal by Fire: The Civil War and Reconstruction 399 Estimates are that at least 2,000 more were injured. Total property damage was about $1 million. Historian Samuel Morison wrote that the riots were \\"equivalent to a Confederate victory\\". The city treasury later indemnified one-quarter of the amount. Fifty buildings, including two Protestant churches, burned to the ground. On August 19, the draft was resumed. Notable leaders from New York New York was the most populous state in the Union at the outbreak of the American Civil War, with more than 3.5 million residents.United States Census, 1860. As such, it provided a significant number of leading generals, admirals, and politicians who were either born in New York or spent considerable time there before the war.

It served as an unorganized region that had been set aside specifically for Native American tribes and was occupied mostly by tribes which had been removed from their ancestral lands in the Southeastern United States following the Indian Removal Act of 1830. As part of the Trans-Mississippi Theater, the Indian Territory was the scene of numerous skirmishes and seven officially recognized battles involving both Native American units allied with the Confederate States of America and Native Americans loyal to the United States government, as well as other Union and Confederate troops. A total of at least 7,860 Native Americans from the Indian Territory participated in the Confederate Army, as both officers and enlisted men;American Civil War Resource Database most came from the Five Civilized Tribes: the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole nations.Confer, Clarissa. The Cherokee Nation in the Civil War, Norman, Oklahoma: University of Oklahoma Press, 2007, pg. 4 The Union organized several regiments of the Indian Home Guard to serve in the Indian Territory and occasionally in adjacent areas of Kansas, Missouri, and Arkansas.Tom Franzmann. \\"Indian Home Guard.\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History & Culture Native American alliances Before the outbreak of war, the United States government relocated all soldiers in the Indian Territory to other key areas, leaving the territory unprotected from Texas and Arkansas, which had already joined the Confederacy. The Confederacy took an interest in the territory, seeking a possible source of food in the event of a Union blockade, a connection to western territories, and a buffer between Texas and the Union- held Kansas. At the onset of war, Confederate forces took possession of the U.S. army forts in the area. In June and July 1861, Confederate officers negotiated with Native American tribes for combat support. After refusing to allow Creek lands to be annexed by the Confederacy, the Creek Principal Chief Opothleyahola led the Creek supporters of the Union to Kansas, having to fight along the way. Leaders from each of the Five Civilized Tribes, acting without the consensus of their councils, agreed to be annexed by the Confederacy in exchange for certain rights, including protection and recognition of current tribal lands.Gibson, Arrell. Oklahoma, a History of Five Centuries (University of Oklahoma Press, 1981) pg. 117‚Äì120 After reaching Kansas and Missouri, Opothleyahola and Native Americans loyal to the Union formed three volunteer regiments known as the Indian Home Guard. It fought in the Indian Territory and Arkansas. The following Indian Nations signed treaties of alliance with the CSA: * Cherokee Nation * Chickasaw Nation * Choctaw Nation * Creek Nation * Seminole Nation * Comanche Nation * Osage Nation * Quapaw Nation * Seneca‚ÄìCayuga Nation * Shawnee Nation Logistics in Indian Territory After abandoning its forts in the Indian Territory early in the Civil War, the Union Army was unprepared for the logistical challenges of trying to regain control of the territory from the Confederate government. The area was largely undeveloped relative to its neighbors: roads were sparse and primitive, and railroads did not yet exist in the territory. Pro-Union Indians had abandoned their own farms because of raids by pro-Confederacy Indians and fled to Kansas or Missouri, seeking protection from better-organized Union forces there. The Union did not have enough troops to control the few roads, and it was not feasible to sustain a large military operation by living off the land. This was demonstrated in 1862 when General William Weer's \\"Indian Expedition\\" into the Indian Territory from Kansas met with disaster when food and supplies were quickly exhausted and Union supply trains failed to arrive. Military actions Colonel (later Brigadier General) Douglas H. Cooper commanded Confederate forces in the Indian Territory The first battle in the territory occurred on November 19, 1861. Opothleyahola rallied Indians to the Union cause at Deep Fork. A total of 7,000 men, women, and children resided in his camp. A force of 1,400 Confederate soldiers under Colonel Douglas H. Cooper initiated the Battle of Round Mountain, but were repulsed after several waves, leading to a Southern defeat. Opothleyahola then moved his camp to a new location at Chustenalah. On December 26, 1861, Confederate forces again attacked, this time driving Opothleyahola and his people to Kansas during a snowstorm.Gibson pg. 121 The decisive Union victory at the Battle of Pea Ridge in northwest Arkansas in March 1862 established federal control of Arkansas and Missouri and limited the Confederate government's ability to protect its Indian allies. Stand Watie, who fought at Pea Ridge, and other officers operating out of the Indian Territory had to fight on without support. The Union army recaptured its forts in the territory, but was forced to temporarily abandon them when faced with ongoing raids by Stand Watie; later the Union recaptured them again. Stand Watie was the last Confederate commander in the field to surrender. =Indian Expedition of 1862= Major General James G. Blunt, commander of U.S. forces in the Indian Territory In 1862, Union General James G. Blunt ordered Colonel William Weer to lead an expedition into the Indian Territory. The expedition included five white regiments, two Indian regiments and two artillery battalions,Tom Franzmann, \\"Indian Expedition of 1862.\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Accessed October 15, 2015. more than 5,000 men in all. The main objective of the expedition was to escort the Indian refugees who had fled to Kansas back to their homes in the Indian Territory; a secondary objective was to hold the territory for the Union.Cottrell, Steve. Civil War in the Indian Territory, Chapter 1. 1995. Available on Google Books. Accessed October 15, 2015.

May, \\"Locust Grove, Battle of\\", Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture Retrieved April 13, 2013. The expedition camped at Locust Grove for two weeks, waiting for a Union supply train. One detachment from the main force moved on to Fort Gibson, causing the Confederates stationed there to withdraw. However, the Union supply train failed to arrive and supplies of food, forage and ammunition ran low. Weer dithered about what to do next and found solace in drinking heavily. The men under his command soon mutinied, arresting Weer and putting Colonel Frederick Salomon in command and bringing the expedition to an end before making any further progress into Indian Territory.\\"Indian Expedition of 1862.\\" Franzmann, Tom. Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Retrieved December 27, 2014. The expedition encouraged the organization of three Indian Home Guard regiments in support of the Union. =First Battle of Cabin Creek= Two military engagements were fought at the Cabin Creek Battlefield in the Cherokee Nation within Indian Territory. The location was where the Texas Road crossed Cabin Creek, near the present-day town of Big Cabin, Oklahoma. Both the First and Second Battles of Cabin Creek were launched by the Confederate Army to disrupt Union Army supply trains bound from Fort Scott to Fort Gibson. In the First Battle of Cabin Creek, which occurred July 1‚Äì2, 1863, the Union escort was led by Colonel James Monroe Williams. Williams was alerted to the attack and, despite the waters of the creek being swelled by rain, made a successful counterattack upon the entrenched Confederate position and forced them to flee. The battle was the first in which African-American troops fought side-by-side with their white comrades.Steven L. Warren, \\"Cabin Creek, Battles of\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Regtrieved December 30, 2014 =Battle of Honey Springs= Honey Springs Depot, a site of frequent skirmishes, was chosen by General James G. Blunt as the place to engage the largest Confederate forces in Indian Territory. Anticipating that Confederate forces under General Douglas H. Cooper would attempt to join with those under General William Cabell, who was moving to attack Fort Gibson, Blunt approached Honey Springs on July 17, 1863 with a force of 3,000 men, including Native Americans and African-American former slaves. On the morning of July 17, he engaged Cooper in the Battle of Honey Springs, who commanded a force of 3,000‚Äì6,000 men composed primarily of Native Americans. Cooper's troops became unorganized and retreated when wet gunpowder caused misfires and rain hampered their movements. The battle was the largest of the war in the Indian Territory. Following the battle, which essentially secured the Indian Territory for the Union, guerrilla warfare became the primary means of engagement between opposing forces in the territory.Gibson pg. 122‚Äì125 =Battle of Perryville= Perryville, a town halfway between Boggy Depot and Scullyville on the Texas Road, had become a major supply depot for the Confederate army. After the Battle of Honey Springs, General Cooper retreated to Perryville, where his troops could be resupplied. General Blunt, who had returned to Fort Gibson, learned that the Confederates had regrouped there and believed his troops could capture the depot and destroy Cooper's forces. Blunt reassembled a force and led them to Perryville. Arriving there on August 23, 1863, he found that the Confederate commanders, Cooper and Watie, had already left for Boggy Depot. Only a small rear guard, commanded by Brigadier General William Steele, remained at Perryville. Blunt attacked under cover of darkness and the two sides exchanged artillery fire. The Union forces quickly scattered the Confederates, who eventually retreated again, leaving their supplies behind. Blunt's forces captured whatever supplies they could use, then burned the town.Edwards, Whit. \\"Perryville, Battle of,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture, 2009. Accessed March 1, 2015. Instead of following the retreating Confederates southwest toward Boggy Depot, Blunt proceeded to attack Fort Smith, which he captured on September 1, 1863.The History of Oklahoma.

Available on Google Books.Retrieved September 21, 2014. =Battle of Middle Boggy= On February 13, 1864, a force of about 350 Union troops supported by two howitzers attacked a Confederate outpost in the Indian Territory. The outpost was guarded by about 90 poorly armed Confederate soldiers. The outpost was located where the Dragoon Road crossed the Middle Boggy River. The Confederates resisted, holding off the Union troops for about half an hour, then fled on foot toward Fort Washita. The Union Army claimed victory because 49 Confederates were killed, while the Union forces suffered no deaths.Messer, Dr. Carroll. \\"Battle of Middle Boggy: Phillips' Expedition of 1864 into Indian Territory.\\" May 17, 2014. Retrieved January 2, 2015. The encounter had no strategic impact on the outcome of the Civil War. This was the last significant skirmish of the war in Indian Territory. It was a defeat for the Confederates, but the mistreatment of civilians and killings of wounded soldiers by the Union troops strengthened the resolve of Confederates and their sympathizers to continue the fight.Steven L. Warren, \\"Middle Boggy, Battle of,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Retrieved February 28, 2015. =Second Battle of Cabin Creek= Brigadier General Stand Watie, the last Confederate general to surrender The Second Battle of Cabin Creek was part of a plan conceived by Confederate Brigadier General Stand Watie, who had been promoted from colonel after the First Battle of Cabin Creek. The plan was to have a Confederate force attack central Kansas from Indian Territory, raiding Union Army facilities and encouraging Indian tribes in western Kansas to join in an attack on the eastern part of the state. Watie presented the plan to his superior, General Samuel B. Maxey, on February 5, 1864. Maxey approved the plan on the condition that the attack would start by October 1, to coincide with an attack on Missouri already planned by General Sterling Price. =Guerrilla warfare= From 1864 until the early summer of 1865, hostilities in the Indian Territory consisted mainly of guerrilla attacks. Confederate Colonel William Quantrill and his gang committed a number of raids throughout the lands of the Five Civilized Tribes. Armed gangs known as \\"free raiders\\" mostly stole horses and cattle, while burning the communities of both Confederate and Indian supporters. A third type of marauder was the Confederate Army unit led by General Stand Watie, which attacked only objectives having military value. They destroyed only houses and barns used by Union troops as headquarters, for quartering troops or for storing supplies. Watie also targeted military supply trains because that not only deprived the Union troops of food, forage and ammunition but gave significant amounts of other booty that he could distribute to his men. One of Watie's most notable successes during this time was the ambush of the steamboat J.R. Williams in September 1864. Watie surrendered, along with his troops, at Doaksville on June 23, 1865. Aftermath 42 years after the end of the Civil War, Indian Territory entered the Union as the State of Oklahoma. However, American Indians would not become full U.S. citizens until 17 years later. Allen Wright (Choctaw) sought reconciliation and led his tribe's delegation to sign the Treaty of 1866. At Fort Towson in Choctaw lands, General Stand Watie officially became the last Confederate general to surrender on June 25, 1865. Watie went to Washington, D.C. later that year for negotiations on behalf of his tribe; as the principal chief of the pro-Confederacy group elected in 1862, he was seeking recognition of a Southern Cherokee Nation. He did not return home until May 1866.Confer pg. 9, 158 The US government negotiated only with the Cherokee who had supported the Union; it named John Ross as the rightful principal chief (he had gone into exile in 1862 when the majority supported the Confederacy). As part of the Reconstruction Treaties, U.S. officials forced land concessions upon the tribes; it also required the Cherokee and other tribes to emancipate their slaves and give them full rights as members of their respective tribes, including rights to annuities and land allocations.Confer pg. 156 The Southern Cherokee had wanted the U.S. government to pay to relocate Cherokee Freedmen from the tribe. Later the issue of citizenship caused contention when American Indian lands were allotted to households under the Dawes Commission. In the early 20th century, the Cherokee Nation voted to exclude the Freedmen from the tribe, unless they also had direct descent from a Cherokee (not just a Cherokee Freedman) listed on the Dawes Rolls (1902‚Äì1906).

Most of the plants placed here were once assembled with more or less related genera in the paraphyletic Sterculiaceae; a lesser number were placed in the Tiliaceae which were also not monophyletic. The Dombeyoideae were originally described by Carl Beilschmied in 1833. In the present delimitation, they contain roughly 20 genera with about 380 species, some 60% of which are in Dombeya (one of the most speciose genera of Malvaceae). They grow in the Old World tropics, especially Madagascar and the Mascarenes where about two-thirds of the species occur. In the Mascarenes, they are among the most diverse angiosperm groups, analogous to such (unrelated) plants as the aeoniums on the Canary Islands or the silversword alliance of the Hawaiian Islands.Cao et al. (2006) The subfamily is sometimes further divided into tribes (Corchoropsideae, Dombeyeae, Eriolaeneae, Helmiopsideae), but this is more often considered unwarranted. Probably, most or all of these supposed subdivisions are not monophyletic and thus technically synonyms of the whole subfamily. Several species are noted for their beautiful timber which is used for inlays and other artwork. Others ‚Äì namely from the type genus Dombeya ‚Äì are popular ornamental plants due to their beautiful flowers.

See also: Origins The mill was built by James Mitchel in 1800 at North Haven, on a peninsula just north of Sag Harbor called Hog Neck in the nineteenth century. Relocated here in 1813, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The windmill measures 29 feet 4-1/2 inches from the first floor to the apex of the cap, making it the shortest surviving windmill on Long Island.

Of the local mills, it is the only example of the early type of smock mill, which had a stationary tower with a revolving cap that sat directly on a greased curb at the top of the tower.

Originally the windmill was built in Sag Harbor and moved by oxen to the commons in Water Mill. In later years (1860) the land was deeded to the Corwith family after the mill had operated on public lands for 50 years, similar gristmills in the area were considered to be community property and also sat on public land. Several generations of Corwiths operated the mill until grinding ceased in 1887. The Water Mill Village Improvement Association (a non-profit group) currently owns and maintains it. The windmill was completely restored In 1987. In 2010, the WMVIA replaced the main driveshaft and all the wind vanes. The Watermill Green surrounding the Windmill is used for community activities such as antique auto shows and events throughout the year. The gristmill was landmarked in 1984.https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/ny1142/ The shortage of paper records makes the financials relating to the operation of the windmill murky. Purchased for $750, there was records of indebtedness where it was used as collateral for James Corwith's bills, but he maintained ownership. He is listed as a farmer in 1860 but by then was no longer active as a miller. Unlike the Hook (1806), Beebe (1820), Shelter Island (1810), Hayground (1801) and Wainscott (1813) mills, as well as others, the Windmill at Water Mill never appears on the United States Products of Industry Census in any decade between 1850 and 1880.http://cdn.loc.gov/master/pnp/habshaer/ny/ny1100/ny1142/data/ny1142data.pdf pg.10 With several other custom windmills a few miles away from Water Mill in Bridgehampton, Amagansett, East Hampton, Southampton, Hayground, Wainscott and Shelter Island, the Corwith mill probably mainly served just the small community of Water Mill, which by 1887 had roughly two hundred inhabitants engaged primarily in farming. By 1890, wealthy city dwellers were buying properties in the east end and creating large country estates, some farmers turned to the service economy of being tradesmen to these newcomers. James son Samuel, a carpenter, took over the day to day ownership and operation of the mill.Elizabeth H. White, \\"The Water Mill Windmill,\\" Southampton Press (September 8, 1932, n.p., clipping in the Southampton Colonial Society Scrapbook, 655. The property was sold in 1888 to Josiah Lombard and Marshall Ayres, businessmen from New York City. They had purchased eight acres southwest of the windmill and built a large Queen Anne style summer house on the site. The landscaping altered the prevailing summer wind making mill operation even harder, so Samuel Corwith sold the mill to them for $900. Ayers and Lombard sold it back to Samuel in 1895 for $1 and he immediately conveyed it to his son, James, for $10. Dr. Edward L. Keyes bought the Lombard/Ayers estate in 1896 and the now worthless mill from James Corwith for $10 in 1898. The mill now served as a decoration on the Keyes estate, over time the stones under it were replaced by a foundation and ivy grew on the walls. In 1909, Edward P. Morse, a Brooklyn shipbuilder, bought the Keyes property, including the triangle the windmill sat on.L.I.

Shortly thereafter, the sisterhood deeded the windmill and its 1.852 acre triangular green to the Trustees of Water Mill Park on the condition that the Town of Southampton maintain it as a public park and \\"keep the windmill thereon in good repair.\\"WINDMILL AT WATER MILL HAER No. NY-134 (page 18) Apparently - all the conditions were \\"not performed,\\" and the title to the property reverted to the Nuns.

During the 1930s there were some exterior repairs but none to the machinery. The hurricane of 1938 did considerable damage to the mill and additional repairs were made, the cap was dislodged and the tailpole needed re-attachment. A new windshaft was fashioned by a carpenter in Southampton, no other interior work was done until after another hurricane in 1954. In the late 1950s the frames of at least two of the sails were again replaced and in the early 1970s new sash was installed throughout.Interview, Eric P. Corwith, May 2, 1978; interview, James L.

Meithalun has four mosques, six schools, four pharmacies, two weather stations, two kindergartens, two clinics: maternity and general, several workshops, two multipurpose halls, two cemeteries, a police station, an office of the Ministry of Interior, three bakeries, four Internet cafes, two cultural centers, two major diwans, and a bank (Bank of Palestine). The town occupies an area of around 12,495 dunums. Etymology According to E. H. Palmer, Meithalun's name derives from Mithilihieh, which in Phoenician means \\"an image\\". The classical Arabic translation is \\"traces of a dwelling which are becoming effaced\\".Palmer, 1881, p. 112 and p. 187. History Pottery from the Roman and Byzantine periods in Palestine have been found in the old core of Meithalun.Zertal, 2004, p. 245 =Crusader era= Meithalun was referred to \\"Gastine Medeclala\\" and \\"Gastine Mesdedula\\" by the Crusaders. King Amalric I apportioned half of the site to the Crusader lord Guido and the other half to another lord known as Gilbert of Neapolis. In 1186, it became part of the Jeoshafat Abbey after it was purchased from Guido.R√∂hricht, 1893, RRH, p. 170, # 643 =Ottoman era= Meithalun was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire with the rest of Palestine in 1517. In the 1596 Ottoman tax records, Meithalun had a population of 16 families and one bachelor. The entire population were Muslim. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 33.3% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, olive trees, goats and beehives, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 7,160 ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 128. During the later Ottoman era, Meithalun was part of the Mashariq Jarrar subdistrict and in the 19th century was in the zone of influence of the Nablus-based textile merchant Hajj Isma'il Arafat, along with the villages of Sanur, Beit Lid, Silat ad-Dhahr and Jaba'.Doumani, 1995, pp. 79-80. In 1838, Biblical scholar Edward Robinson saw the village when he travelled in the region, and described it as being situated in an extremely fertile area.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, pp. 151, 153 He listed it as part of the District of Haritheh, north of Nablus.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, 2 appendix, p. 129. In 1851‚Äì52, French archaeologist Louis F√©licien de Saulcy noted that Meithalun was one of two villages in the southern part of the Marj Sanur valley, the other village being Sir. He describes the Marj Sanur valley as being ‚Äúenclosed within a belt of mountains of a very woody and agreeable aspect.‚ÄùSaulcy, 1854, vol 1, p. 87 In 1870, French explorer Victor Gu√©rin described Meithalun as ‚Äúa small village on a low hill.

In the latter census, the hamlet of Kheibar was counted with Meithalun.Mills, 1932, p. 71 In both censuses, the entire population was Muslim. Meithalun's two main clans, the Na'irat and the Ruba'iya, participated in the countrywide 1936‚Äì1939 revolt against British rule and increased Zionist settlement in Palestine. Rebels from the Na'irat clan, who had ties to the Jarrar clan, fought under commander Fawzi Jarrar of Jaba', while the Ruba'iya fought under the Qassamite commander Abu Khalid of Silat ad-Dhahr and Abu Saysan of Qabatiya. The latter was a traditional ally of the Abd al-Hadi clan, who had economic and political ties to the Ruba'iya.Swedenberg, 2003, p. 132 In the 1945 statistics the population was 1,360, all Muslims,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics, 1945, p. 16. with 12,495 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

They first appeared as a common enemy in 1988's Super Mario Bros. 3, in which they were called Boo Diddleys (a reference to the American blues singer Bo Diddley). Since then, they have been a mainstay in the Mario series, usually appearing as enemies, but occasionally appearing as playable characters in the Mario spin-off games, or even as allies of Mario. They also have prominent roles in Luigi's Mansion, Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon and Luigi's Mansion 3. They are named after the sound that one might make when trying to frighten someone (\\"boo!\\"), whereas their Japanese name comes from the verb , meaning 'to be shy'. A Boo's most common pattern of attack is to sneak up on the player (usually Mario) from behind while they are facing away from them; however, they stop their attack if looked at. Being ghosts, they are usually invincible, and unable to be defeated without certain items or conditions. It has been implied that Boos may have been other living species before they became Boos, but this has not been made clear. There are also sub- species of Boo based on other species; for example undead Shy Guys become \\"Boo Guys\\" while undead Lakitus become \\"Fishin' Boo\\"s. Concept and creation Artwork of two \\"Boo Diddleys\\" from Super Mario Bros. 3 (1988) In an interview with Nintendo Power magazine, Mario franchise creator Shigeru Miyamoto stated that while working on Super Mario Bros. 3, co-designer Takashi Tezuka had the idea of putting his wife in the game. According to Miyamoto, \\"(Tezuka's) wife is very quiet normally, but one day she exploded, maddened by all the time he spent at work. In the game, there is now a character who shrinks when Mario looks at it, but when Mario turns away, it will grow large and menacing\\". Boos appear as white, spherical, levitating ghosts, similar to the will-o'-the-wisp phenomenon or the Japanese Hitodama. They have faces featuring large fangs and long tongues, and three short extremities which resemble two arms and a tail. Being ghosts, Boos often appear in haunted house-themed levels in the games, in which they'll \\"sneak up\\" on the player, much in the fashion of ghosts of popular culture. Their presence can be recognized by their signature cackle. They are generally depicted as bashful and mischievous in nature. Appearances =Mario series= Boos first appeared as \\"Boo Diddleys\\" in 1988's Super Mario Bros. 3 for the NES, appearing in the more difficult fortress levels in which they pester Mario or Luigi by sneaking up on them. Since their first appearance, apart from their names being shortened simply to \\"Boos\\", their design or habits have not changed significantly, despite their appearances in most games since Super Mario Bros. 3. They have, however, spawned a number of subspecies over the years, with the first being the \\"Stretch\\" that also debuted Super Mario Bros. 3. Stretches are essentially Boos that are attached to platforms that will pop up to Mario or Luigi should they attempt to step on it. Boos played a much more prominent role in Super Mario World, in which they were the starring enemies in the game's many Ghost House levels. In these levels, Boos would attack in groups and in a number of creative attack patterns, such as flying in wide circles in order to create obstacles for the player, or swarming in order to increase their attack radius. Super Mario World also introduced the \\"Fishin' Boo\\", a ghostly version of a Lakitu, as well as the secret boss \\"Big Boo\\", a larger and stronger Boo who would return as a boss throughout the series and even gain a subspecies of the same name. Super Mario World was also the first game to reveal that some Boos were able to transform into blocks, which, if lured into a suitable position, can be used to reach otherwise unreachable platforms. This trait later reappeared in Yoshi's Story of the Yoshi series and Super Mario Sunshine. In Super Mario 64, an entire course was designed around the Boo character, titled \\"Big Boo's Haunt\\". In this game - unlike most preceding it - Boos could actually be killed by attacking them, by using moves such as a punch or ground pound. Staying true to the gameplay mechanic of previous games featuring Boo, if Mario looks away from Boo, it will attempt to move closer and attack Mario. However, if Mario retains eye contact with Boo, it will become translucent and impervious to attack. King Boo (left) and Luigi (right) in Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon promotional artwork In the 2001 GameCube launch title, Luigi's Mansion, the Boos were given the role of primary villains, alongside other miscellaneous ghosts of the mansion. The game's primary antagonist is King Boo, their king who leads the Boos of the mansion and who is responsible from trapping Mario inside a portrait. It was this game that established Luigi's fear of ghosts - particularly Boos - which would become a defining aspect of his timid and somewhat cowardly personality. To continue this theme, Boos began to target Luigi in future games, with King Boo in particular becoming Luigi's archenemy. For instance, they locked Luigi away in Super Mario 64 DS and trapped Luigi in a haunted mansion in Super Mario Galaxy. King Boo and his minions once again play a prominent role in its sequels. In Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2, Mario and Luigi are able to transform into Boos themselves, through the use of the \\"Boo Mushroom\\" (a version of the series' famous Super Mushroom). In this form, the player is able to levitate and pass through certain walls, and being able to understand the Boos' language, \\"Booish\\". Boos also make frequent appearances in the Mario spin-off games, sometimes as enemies or as part of the scenery, but sometimes as playable characters, the first instance of this being a playable Boo in Mario Tennis for the Nintendo 64. Starting in Mario Kart 64, Boos have appeared as items in some of the Mario Kart games, in which their purpose is to steal items from other racers. King Boo appeared as a playable racer in Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and Mario Kart Tour. Boos reappear in Super Mario 3D Land and New Super Mario Bros. 2, the latter of which introduces a new subspecies called the \\"Boohemoth\\". The first appearance of a friendly Paper Boo who fought on Paper Mario's side was Lady Bow from the first Paper Mario game. Since then, later games, particularly the Paper Mario series (especially Mario & Luigi: Paper Jam), have presented other Paper Boos in a friendly and more positive light. Since the release of Mario Party: Star Rush, a Boo amiibo figure (which glows in the dark) was released. =Yoshi series= Being the sister series of the Mario games, Boos also appear in similar roles throughout the Yoshi series, making their first appearance in the 1991 puzzle game, Yoshi (known as Yoshi's Egg in Japan and as Mario & Yoshi in Europe and Australia), in which they appeared alongside Goombas, Piranha Plants and Bloopers as \\"blocks\\" which must be stacked in order to hatch a sizable Yoshi. They also appear as opponents in 1992's Yoshi's Cookie, as well as appearing as enemies in the 1993 first-person shooter Yoshi's Safari. Boos have also appeared in a number of forms in all of Yoshi's main platform games, starting with Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island in 1995, in which they appear as common enemies, as well as having a boss in the form of 'Bigger Boo'. In the Yoshi games, Boos mainly act in the same way as they do in the Mario games. =Other appearances= Outside of the games, Boos also appear in the Super Mario-kun comics. They also make an appearance in The Legend of Zelda: Link‚Äôs Awakening, along with several other Mario characters. Boo also appeared in Super Mario Bros. U crossover Puzzle & Dragons Z.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic- riffs/wp/2015/06/09/puzzles-dragons-z-super-mario-bros-edition-struggles-to- make-free-to-play-games-worth-a-higher-price-of- admission/?utm_term=.c4c34bfe0909 Reception With Boo being one of the more popular Mario enemies, their image has been used in official Nintendo merchandise, such as plush dolls, as well as cookie cutters. IGN's Audrey Drake listed Boo as one of the best enemies in the Mario series while GameDaily ranked Boo seventh in a similar list, saying it is \\"unique\\" due to the fact that \\"Mario cannot kill with a Fire Flower or using one of his special suits.\\" They also placed Boo fifth in a list of Nintendo characters that deserve their own games, calling it \\"Nintendo's favorite ghost\\". Boo was listed as the second best ghost in video game history by Joystick Division. In a reader-based poll, it placed on top of best ghost characters in a Nintendo game, receiving four times as many votes as the Pac-Man ghosts; King Boo also featured on the same list, placing eighth. A Cel-shaded of Mario cosplay takes on a Borderlands 3, with the recreation of Boo and being locked in a cage that hung from behind the cosplayer back and being the eyes lit up.https://www.dexerto.com/cosplay/cel-shaded-super-mario-cosplay- borderlands-3-twist-1158404 Celeste Monsour of geek culture website Fandomania published a list of ten of her favorite Boo-related arts and crafts created by fans for Halloween. The British Official Nintendo Magazine included the Boo Mushroom in their \\"Top 20 Mario Power-ups\\", ranking it at fourteenth, stating that it's \\"ruddy mint\\". Geekosystem also included the Boo Mushroom in their list of the \\"10 Greatest Mario Power-Ups\\", rating it 3rd in usefulness and 5th in whimsy, and 7th overall. Game Informer editor Tim Turi listed Big Boo among the top 10 ghosts, calling all Boos \\"timid, invulnerable nuisances\\", but calling out the \\"huge, screen filling\\" Big Boo in particular because of the need to trampoline over it in Super Mario World. In 2013, ScrewAttack placed King Boo at number 2 in top ten Ghosts in video game history.

They were known as Desavazhis, who were directly subordinate to the supreme power which was NƒÅduvƒÅzhi. Pallichal Pillai and Kodumon Pillai were the most powerful domains among the eight in Travancore. In the earlier 17th century the Karanavar of the family of Pallichal Pillai moved to Vanchimuttam near Attingal. All the family members of Pallichal Pillai family remained in Pallichal. This was because the Pallichal Pillai had slightly more alliance with Kollam and Attingal Swaroopams, and the south and east part of Karamana River was under the jurisdiction of Travancore, and because Pallichal is in this area. So he moved to avoid allegation of sedition on him by the Travancore royal family. There are other legends attributable to the 8 Pillais. One view is that the king had no regular army those days. When war was threatened, the King sent messages to the 8 Pillais, who were masters of the ancient martial art \\"Kalaripayaatu\\" and had several trained warriors under their command. They sent their forces to fight the war. However Marthanda Varma, the King was a very ambitious man and he felt that this system had to change if he was to have his way. Since the Pillais were very popular they could not be done away with easily. False stories were spread about them and their houses and families destroyed by surprise attacks with the help of alien forces called \\"Maravas\\" and using soldiers and firearms captured from the Dutch.

The prison has several separate sections. The compound houses up to 20,000 inmates. Within the perimeter of the compound are the Women's Central Prison, often referred to as \\"Lat Yao\\" or \\"Lat Yao women's prison\\". There is the Central Correction Institution for Drug Addicts (also known as \\"Bambat Phiset\\") \\"Bangkok Special Prison\\", and the Central Correctional Hospital. The Lat Yao men's section takes custody of male offenders whose sentence term is not over 25 years. As of 2002 the men's section held 1,158 foreigners from 56 countries out of a total of 7,218 prisoners. It is a part of the Thai Department of Corrections. The Klong Prem section for women houses female death row inmates.Joseph, Joanne and Larissa Focke. Drug Muled: Sixteen Years in a Thai Prison. Jacana Media, 2013. , 9781920601201. p. 195. \\"Goosen says that[...]when she was on death row,[...]She tells of how, shortly after she arrived at Lard Yao,[...]\\" History Klong Prem Central prison was originally a temporary prison established in 1944 in the Lat Yao District as a consequence of demands during World War II when Thailand was at war with Britain and the United States. In 1959 it was used as a vocational training centre for those who, in the words of the Thai corrections department, \\"act and behave as gangsters\\". In 1960 the old Klong Prem prison on Maha Chai Road (now the Bangkok Corrections Museum) had become overcrowded so all prisoners were transferred to the vocational training centre site. The Interior Ministry established a temporary prison within the new compound by dividing one part into a vocational training centre and the other part into the Lat Yao temporary central prison. In 1972 the Interior Ministry issued orders establishing the prison on Maha Chai Road as the \\"Bangkok Remand Prison\\" and the prison in the Lat Yao Subdistrict was designated the \\"Klong Prem Central Prison\\". Visiting Klong Prem Klong Prem Central Prison allows the families and pre-registered guests of inmates to visit prisoners. Visiting rules and times vary and international visitors have some special privileges. Different days are allocated to certain cell blocks. Weekend visits are typically prohibited. Additional privileges (e.g., phones, longer visits) when visiting foreign prisoners can sometimes be attained with a letter from the appropriate embassy or with bribes to prison guards. Food for prisoners can be purchased at the commissary by completing a form listing the items to be purchased and the prisoner's name. After paying for the items, the order is generally delivered that evening or the next day. As of October 2018, prisoners are normally held in Bangkok Remand Prison until sentencing. After sentencing, they may be sent to either the main prison, Bambat Phiset (for drugs offences), or complete their sentence in Bangkok Remand Prison. In Bangkok Remand Prison there are eight buildings in which prisoners may be held. Prison World Cup With the large number of foreign nationals at Klong Prem, the prison is able to hold a football World Cup. Teams of 10 are chosen by prison staff to represent Nigeria, Japan, the US, Italy, France, England, Germany, and Thailand. Games consist of two 20-minute halves on a half-sized pitch. The winners are given a replica of the real World Cup trophy, which is made of wood in the prison workshop. Current and former notable prisoners Foreign prisoners are concentrated in Building 2, and those prisoners may have contact visits for several days providing visitors can demonstrate they have traveled from another country. As of June 2010, there are many foreign prisoners in other buildings of the prison complex. * Jon Cole, American heroin smuggler.

The girls, Rose (Lucy Hale) and Sage (Ashley Newbrough), are beautiful, rebellious, and less- than-thrilled with their new tutor, but Megan is determined to win them over as she enjoys the perks of her new job: breathtaking private suite, gorgeous convertible, and live-in chef Marco (Allan Louis).

Due to the Mexican Revolution in 1906, she and her family were asked to leave the country, forcing them to migrate to the United States. She did her undergraduate work at the New Mexico State University, graduating with a Bachelor of Science in 1927. She went on to earn a master's degree from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1930 and a Ph.D in microbiology from the University of Chicago in 1939. In 1949, she became the first woman to be awarded an MD Degree from Georgetown University School of Medicine.Biography from gwis.org =Career= Sarah Elizabeth Stewart, ca 1950 Stewart joined the National Institutes of Health (NIH) from 1935-1944 while completing her PhD at the University of Chicago. During her time there, she took part in developing a vaccine for gangrene, which helped many soldiers during the second world war. She later left her position in the NHI in order to pursue her goals and research field, which was to prove that there was a connection between cancers and viruses. This proved to be difficult because, at the time, not many scientist took this field seriously. She had also recreated Ludwik Gross‚Äô experiment with mice, which showed that the Leukemia found in certain mice was indeed caused by viruses; they released a paper together discussing their findings. She went on to teach microbiology at Georgetown University's School of Medicine, and once women were allowed to enroll, she became their first female graduate at the age of 39. Stewart returned to the NIH in 1951, joining the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and eventually becoming medical director. Stewart developed an interest in researching viral links to cancer in light of the pioneering research of Jonas Salk in developing a vaccine for the virus which caused polio. Stewart is credited with discovering the Polyomavirus in 1953. She and research partner, Dr. Bernice E. Eddy, were successful in growing the virus in 1958 and the SE (Stewart-Eddy) polyoma virus is named after them. They were able to prove that the polyoma virus could create 20 different kinds of tumors in mice as well as other animals. Stewart was the first to successfully demonstrate that viruses causing cancer could be spread from animal to animal.Stanley, Autumn. Mothers and Daughters of Invention, Page 165. 1993, Rutgers University Press. This experiment and its results, amongst other similar experiments, led many researchers to becoming interested in the field viral oncology. She left the NIH to become professor at Georgetown University in 1971. =Death and afterward= Stewart died of cancer at her home in New Smyrna Beach, Florida on November 27, 1976. A collection of her papers is held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland. = Awards = In 1965, Stewart was awarded the Federal Women‚Äôs Award. She also won the Lenghi Award of the Accademia Nazionale Dei Lincei and the Daughters of Penelope Salute to Women Award in 1972 amongst many more.

Biography Countess Maria von Maltzan was born into a wealthy family at Militsch Palace, Silesia, Germany (today Milicz, Poland) and was raised on the family's estate, the youngest of eight children. After completing grade school in Berlin in 1927, she decided to undertake studies in zoology at the University of Breslau, a rare occurrence for a girl during this time. Her family was strictly against the idea, but her teachers supported her and she got permission. In 1928 she enrolled at the University of Munich where she received her doctorate in natural sciences five years later. When the Nazis seized power in 1933, her sense of justice made her join different resistance movements against the Nazis almost immediately. For years she worked as an underground-fighter. Due to her status and relation to numerous Nazi officers, von Maltzan was at first above suspicion. Maria von Maltzan's sister Alix was married to Field Marshal Walther von Reichenau. As the brutality of the Nazi R√©gime accelerated with murder, violence and terror, the seeds of their plan for the total extermination of the Jews dawned on Maria von Maltzan in all its horror - and she immediately decided to act. Back in Berlin since 1935, she always responded to calls for help and took the Jews into her own home, fed and protected them, right under the noses of the Gestapo. Due to her well-known political attitude she had to get by with numerous jobs before in 1940 she began studying veterinary medicine, graduating in 1943. Throughout the war the Countess von Maltzan in cooperation with the Swedish Church provided a safe haven for more than 60 Jews, deserters and forced labourers, arranging for them to escape to safety. She falsified official visas and other documents and helped many Jews escape from Berlin in trucks that she often drove herself. Before World War II she got to know the Jewish author Hans Hirschel, the former editor of Das Dreieck, an avant-garde German literary journal founded in 1925. From 1942 to the end of the war she sheltered Hirschel in a special hiding place inside a couch in the living room of her apartment in Wilmersdorf, thus saving his life at the peril of her own. Von Maltzan became pregnant with Hans's child. She later recalled how the new- born baby was placed in an incubator and the hospital was bombed. The electricity running the incubator stopped and the baby died. Shortly afterwards she adopted two little girls from a children's camp. After the war von Maltzan married Hans Hirschel but the marriage failed. They separated after two years, then remarried in 1972. During the post-war-years Maria had many difficulties, but grateful Jews, who never forgot her heroism, helped her survive bitter years. Because of the horrors of the war she became addicted to drugs and at times lost her approbation as a veterinarian. She later recalled how she was even brought to a psychiatric hospital and had to scrub floors day after day to afford a living.  Post-war life and legacy  After Hans Hirschel died in 1975, Countess Maria von Maltzan, aged 66, decided once again to build up a new existence with her own veterinary practice in Berlin, from 1981 on located in the Kreuzberg district, where she became famous for the cost-free treatment of dogs owned by local punks and her struggle for improvement of the living conditions of immigrants. In 1986, she published her autobiography titled Beat the Drums and Be Without Fright, which made her life and work known to a wider public. She was granted the Righteous among the Nations award from the Israeli Government one year later. She died in Berlin in 1997.

(November 15, 1905 - October 19, 1985), was an American percussionist from the early 1930s to the late 1950s. In New York and Hollywood he worked on radio, in films, and as a recording artist. He is the father of Hollywood film score composer and Boston Pops Laureate Conductor John Williams, and the grandfather of singer Joseph Williams and pianist/composer Paula Arlich. Raymond Scott Quintette Williams played drums in the New York-based CBS Radio orchestra in the early 1930s, and achieved stardom as drummer for the Raymond Scott Quintette from 1936 to 1939. Despite the name, the band was a sextet. Formed by Scott from the ranks of the CBS orchestra, the Quintette was an overnight sensation at the end of 1936, thanks to Scott's eccentric approach to jazz and idiosyncratic titles (e.g., \\"Dinner Music for a Pack of Hungry Cannibals\\" and \\"War Dance for Wooden Indians,\\" both of which showcase the drummer's virtuosity). In addition to the standard jazz drum and cymbal setup, Williams used a lot of cowbell, wood block, and tuned percussion. He had a flawless sense of timing, and was able to execute faithfully the abrupt tempo shifts of Scott's dynamic arrangements. Existing film clips of the Quintette show Williams displaying a high degree of showmanship, including stick twirls, tom- tom rides, and popgun rim-shots. His theatrical, effects-heavy approach predated and no doubt influenced the hyperactive style of musician-comedian Spike Jones. Scott was a notorious perfectionist, demanding retake after retake in the rehearsal studio. About this process, Williams told historian Mich√®le Wood, \\"All he ever had was machines, only we had names.\\" Williams, explaining Scott's (commercially successful) penchant for recording rehearsals and using the reference discs to develop and finalize his compositions, said, \\"He didn't write anything, but he edited everything. We would work these things up and we would never change them, ever. We had to do them note for note. It was highly unsatisfactory, and it sold like hell.\\"Wood, Mich√®le, \\"The Men Who Made the Music: Raymond Scott,\\" in The Swing Era, 1937-1938, Time-Life Records, 1971, pp.48-53 Scott painted \\"portraits in jazz,\\" or \\"descriptive jazz\\" ‚Äî what he felt were musical vignettes of colorful evocations, such as \\"Reckless Night on Board an Ocean Liner\\" and \\"Celebration on the Planet Mars\\". Williams considered it undignified, but admittedly lucrative. \\"We really didn't want to do any of it,\\" he told Wood. \\"We thought [it] was descriptive, all right, but not jazz, because jazz is right now, not memorized note for note. And after all this compulsive rehearsal, suddenly it all caught on and we were making more money than anybody else in town, all thanks to him. We were doing records, public appearances, making movies, everything.\\" Williams also acknowledged a performance dividend. \\"All that discipline helped ... It had to. I developed a technique way beyond what I'd had\\", he told Wood.Wood, ibid. The Quintette recorded for the Master, Brunswick, and Columbia labels. When Scott went to Hollywood in late 1937 to work in motion pictures, Williams accompanied the bandleader and appeared on camera with the Quintette in the films Happy Landing (starring Sonja Henie, Ethel Merman, and Don Ameche), Sally, Irene and Mary (starring Alice Faye, Tony Martin, and Fred Allen), and Ali Baba Goes to Town (starring Eddie Cantor). Although he does not appear on camera, his drumming is heard with the Quintette in the films Nothing Sacred, Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm, and Just Around the Corner. Scott and his band returned to New York in 1938, allegedly due to the leader's disgust at Hollywood culture (\\"They think everything is 'wonderful',\\" he told an interviewer). After dissolving his Quintette in 1939, Scott formed a swing- fashioned big band. Williams remained with the bandleader for at least one incarnation of Scott's newly constituted orchestra. (Scott re-formed the Raymond Scott Quintet [sic] in 1948, but Williams was not involved.)Personnel of Scott's 1948-49 Quintet at AllMusic Professional history Williams featured on the cover of Leedy Drum Topics promotional booklet, October 1939, with Raymond Scott, Kate Smith, Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson, and othersThroughout his association with Scott, Williams continued as an in- demand drummer for the CBS radio network. His assignments included playing for bands led by Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey, Vincent Lopez, Leo Reisman, Jacques Renard, and Alfonso D'Artega. He drummed for singer Kate Smith's radio program and in Mark Warnow's orchestra on the long-running radio program Your Hit Parade in the 1930s and 1940s. (Note: Warnow was Scott's older brother.) When Your Hit Parade moved to California in 1948, Williams relocated to the west coast. In Hollywood he found session work in films, performing for Columbia Pictures in soundtrack orchestras for such films as On the Waterfront, Picnic, and From Here to Eternity. In the 1953 film Let's Do It Again, he \\"ghost- drummed\\" for actor Ray Milland. Williams recorded at least twice under his own name, as Johnny Williams and His Swing Sextet (1937, Variety Records) and Drummer Man Johnny Williams and His Boys (1939, Vocalion Records). These recordings reflect the standard Dixieland-swing style of the period, rather than the Scott novelty approach. Personal life Williams was born in Watertown, Massachusetts. While playing in the CBS Orchestra in New York during the 1930s, Williams studied architecture at Columbia University. He married Esther Towner. In a 2008 interview with Stan Warnow (Raymond Scott's son, a filmmaker) and Jeff Winner (of The Raymond Scott Archives), Williams explained that his father was also an expert marksman who won national awards in pistol shooting. \\"He made his own ammunition,\\" said John, \\"We had a target range in our basement in Queens where he practiced for pistol competitions\\". Williams was a marine instructor during World War II, specializing in the use of the Colt .45 handguns. An early Raymond Scott composition on which Williams fired a loaded pistol on microphone in the pre-Quintette days was a novelty entitled \\"Duet For Pistol and Piano\\". In one surviving shellac of a live radio program where this number was featured, Williams had to improvise rimshots to simulate the gunshots after the pistol he was firing failed.

Prominent vertical datum in use by professionals include the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 and the North American Vertical Datum of 1988. Methods In common usage, elevations are often cited in height above sea level, although what ‚Äúsea level‚Äù actually means is a more complex issue than might at first be thought: the height of the sea surface at any one place and time is a result of numerous effects, including waves, wind and currents, atmospheric pressure, tides, topography, and even differences in the strength of gravity due to the presence of mountains etc. For the purpose of measuring the height of objects on land, the usual datum used is mean sea level (MSL). This is a tidal datum which is described as the arithmetic mean of the hourly water elevation taken over a specific 19 years cycle. This definition averages out tidal highs and lows (caused by the gravitational effects of the sun and the moon) and short term variations. It will not remove the effects of local gravity strength, and so the height of MSL, relative to a geodetic datum, will vary around the world, and even around one country. Countries tend to choose the mean sea level at one specific point to be used as the standard ‚Äúsea level‚Äù for all mapping and surveying in that country. (For example, in Great Britain, the national vertical datum, Ordnance Datum Newlyn, is based on what was mean sea level at Newlyn in Cornwall between 1915 and 1921). However, zero elevation as defined by one country is not the same as zero elevation defined by another (because MSL is not the same everywhere), which is why locally defined vertical datums differ from one another. A different principle is used when choosing a datum for nautical charts. For safety reasons, a mariner must be able to know the minimum depth of water that could occur at any point. For this reason, depths and tides on a nautical chart are measured relative to chart datum, which is defined to be a level below which tide rarely falls. Exactly how this is chosen depends on the tidal regime in the area being charted and on the policy of the hydrographic office producing the chart in question; a typical definition is Lowest Astronomical Tide (the lowest tide predictable from the effects of gravity), or Mean Lower Low Water (the average lowest tide of each day), although MSL is sometimes used in waters with very low tidal ranges. Conversely, if a ship is to safely pass under a low bridge or overhead power cable, the mariner must know the minimum clearance between the masthead and the obstruction, which will occur at high tide. Consequently, bridge clearances etc. are given relative to a datum based on high tide, such as Highest Astronomical Tide or Mean High Water Springs. Sea level does not remain constant throughout geological time, and so tidal datums are less useful when studying very long- term processes. In some situations sea level does not apply at all ‚Äî for instance for mapping Mars' surface ‚Äî forcing the use of a different \\"zero elevation\\", such as mean radius. A geodetic vertical datum takes some specific zero point, and computes elevations based on the geodetic model being used, without further reference to sea levels. Usually, the starting reference point is a tide gauge, so at that point the geodetic and tidal datums might match, but due to sea level variations, the two scales may not match elsewhere. An example of a gravity-based geodetic datum is NAVD88, used in North America, which is referenced to a point in Quebec, Canada. Ellipsoid-based datums such as WGS 84, GRS80 or NAD83 use a theoretical surface that may differ significantly from the geoid. Types Common types of vertical datums include: * The surface of the datum ellipsoid, resulting in an ellipsoidal height * The mean sea level as described by the gravity geoid, yielding the orthometric heightDMA Technical Report Geodesy for the Layman, The Defense Mapping Agency, 1983 Along with the latitude \\\\phi and longitude \\\\lambda, the height h provides the three-dimensional geodetic coordinates or geographic coordinates for a location. To completely specify a location of a topographical feature on, in, or above Earth, one also has to specify the vertical distance from Earth's center or surface. Earth is not a sphere, but an irregular shape approximating a biaxial ellipsoid. It is nearly spherical, but has an equatorial bulge making the radius at the Equator about 0.3% larger than the radius measured through the poles. The shorter axis approximately coincides with the axis of rotation. Though early navigators thought of the sea as a flat surface that could be used as a vertical datum, this is not actually the case. Earth has a series of layers of equal potential energy within its gravitational field. Height is a measurement at right angles to this surface, roughly toward Earth's center, but local variations make the equipotential layers irregular (though roughly ellipsoidal). The choice of which layer to use for defining height is arbitrary.

Galandou Diouf) (14 September 1875 - 6 August 1941) born in Saint-Louis Senegal, was the first African elected official from the advent of colonialism in the territory of French West Africa. Early life Diouf was born to the aristocratic Diouf family. He was of Wolof and Serer background, and as a native of one of the Four Communes of Senegal considered part of France, was granted the (nominally) full rights of French citizenship. He began his career as a schoolteacher and minor government clerk but became progressively involved in politics. Political career Diouf was elected in 1909 to represent the commune of Rufisque at the advisory General Assembly (Conseil G√©n√©ral) of Saint-Louis, then capital of colonial Senegal. He was an editor of the influential \\"La D√©mocratie\\" newspaper, and founding editor of \\"Le S√©n√©gal\\". As a journalist and political leader, he was the political godfather of Blaise Diagne, whose fame and political success quickly supplanted Diouf's own. Diouf and Diagne finally broke in 1928 over Diouf's view that Diagne had conceded too much to French interests, and over Diouf's increasingly anti-Communist and anti- French Socialist Party views. With the death of Blaise Diagne, Ngalandou Diouf was in 1934 elected to the French National Assembly, the seat formerly held by Diagne, leading a coalition of the Centre Left, small farmers, Senegalese veterans of the French military, and followers of the Tijaniyyah Sufi brotherhood which defeated the Socialist and Mouride brotherhood coalition of Lamine Gu√®ye, the attorney who would later carry out much of Diagne's political program.The Cambridge History of Africa J. D. Fage, Roland Anthony Oliver. Cambridge University Press (1977) In the French National Assembly In the Assembly, Diouf joined with the Gauche ind√©pendante (Left Independents), connected to the Parti radical- socialiste of Camille Pelletan. With the German invasion of France in 1940, Diouf did not vote against the 10 July 1940 granting of power to the collaborationist regime of Marshal Petain, having already fled. Diouf had opposed the armistice with the Germans, even drafting an appeal on 19 June 1940 with the Guadeloupean Deputies Gratien Candace and Maurice Satineau to President Albert Lebrun that called on the government to continue the war in the colonies.Gratien Candace 1940 - Gaulliste au 19 juin 1940 / L‚Äôappel du 19 juin . The Massilia Deputies, a rump of 27 Assembly members, including Diouf, √âdouard Daladier, Georges Mandel, Jean Zay, and Pierre Mend√®s-France, boarded the Massilia, a ship chartered to transport Assembly members to Casablanca, where they planned to set up a government in exile.

Randolph Field was innovatively designed using Garden city movement principles, and includes a unique and well-preserved assemblage of Mission Revival and Art Deco architecture. Built between 1929 and 1931, it was the first permanent flight training facility of the United States military establishment, then the United States Army Air Corps and later the United States Air Force. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996, and was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2001. and Description and history The United States Army Air Service provided the aerial warfare capability of the United States during World War I, but most of its facilities were disbanded with the end of that war in 1917. Some flight training operations were maintained at a variety of temporary facilities around the nation into the early 1920s, while a debate took place over the status of the air corps as part of the United States Army. In 1926, the War Department decided to centralize flight training operations, and the Randolph site northeast of San Antonio was identified in 1927. Construction began in 1928 and was essentially complete by the end of 1931. Early plans for the airfield included a circular central element, originally divided by function. The final plan for the base was drafted by George B. Ford, and combined the idea of the circular center with Garden city movement principles, in which the circle contains residences, and the functional and operational parts of the base were located outside the circle. The design also addressed army concerns over the impact of long taxi distances (which increased exposure of the aircraft to dust, resulting in higher maintenance costs) by placing rows of hangars parallel to the field's two runways. The runways were oriented to maximize the benefits of prevailing winds. The design also included the visually prominent Administration Building, known colloquially as the \\"Taj Mahal\\", which is approached from the main base entrance and includes a tower that embeds the base's water tower. Most of the residential buildings on the base are in the Mission Revival style. Their orientation in circular bands eliminates the procession of architecture often found on military bases, and there is individual variation among the buildings, with wings placed on different ends, and the exterior stucco given different coloring. The site includes 350 contributing buildings, sites, and structures, and 47 non- contributing ones; in the Mission Revival, Spanish Colonial Revival, and Streamline Moderne styles.

This solution was developed by A. Flamant A. Flamant. (1892). Sur la r√©partition des pressions dans un solide rectangulaire charg√© transversalement. Compte. Rendu. Acad. Sci. Paris, vol. 114, p. 1465. in 1892 by modifying the three-dimensional solution of Boussinesq. The stresses predicted by the Flamant solution are (in polar coordinates) : \\\\begin{align} \\\\sigma_{rr} & = \\\\frac{2C_1\\\\cos\\\\theta}{r} + \\\\frac{2C_3\\\\sin\\\\theta}{r} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sigma_{r\\\\theta} & = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sigma_{\\\\theta\\\\theta} & = 0 \\\\end{align} where C_1, C_3 are constants that are determined from the boundary conditions and the geometry of the wedge (i.e., the angles \\\\alpha,\\\\beta) and satisfy : \\\\begin{align} F_1 & \\\\+ 2\\\\int_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\beta} (C_1\\\\cos\\\\theta + C_3\\\\sin\\\\theta)\\\\,\\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\, d\\\\theta = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ F_2 & \\\\+ 2\\\\int_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\beta} (C_1\\\\cos\\\\theta + C_3\\\\sin\\\\theta)\\\\,\\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\, d\\\\theta = 0 \\\\end{align} where F_1,F_2 are the applied forces. The wedge problem is self- similar and has no inherent length scale. Also, all quantities can be expressed in the separated-variable form \\\\sigma = f(r)g(\\\\theta). The stresses vary as (1/r).  Forces acting on a half-plane  Elastic half-plane loaded by two point forces. For the special case where \\\\alpha = -\\\\pi, \\\\beta = 0, the wedge is converted into a half-plane with a normal force and a tangential force. In that case : C_1 = - \\\\frac{F_1}{\\\\pi},\\\\quad C_3 = -\\\\frac{F_2}{\\\\pi} Therefore the stresses are : \\\\begin{align} \\\\sigma_{rr} & = -\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi\\\\,r} (F_1\\\\cos\\\\theta + F_2\\\\sin\\\\theta) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sigma_{r\\\\theta} & = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sigma_{\\\\theta\\\\theta} & = 0 \\\\end{align} and the displacements are (using Michell's solution) : \\\\begin{align} u_r & = -\\\\cfrac{1}{4\\\\pi\\\\mu}\\\\left[F_1\\\\\\\\{(\\\\kappa-1)\\\\theta\\\\sin\\\\theta - \\\\cos\\\\theta + (\\\\kappa+1)\\\\ln r\\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\\\\\} + \\\\right. \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\qquad \\\\qquad \\\\left.

This feature of the Flamant solution is confusing and appears unphysical. For a discussion of the issue see http://imechanica.org/node/319. = Displacements at the surface of the half-plane = The displacements in the x_1, x_2 directions at the surface of the half-plane are given by :\\\\begin{align} u_1 & = \\\\frac{F_1(\\\\kappa+1)\\\\lnx_1}{4\\\\pi\\\\mu} + \\\\frac{F_2(\\\\kappa+1)\\\\text{sign}(x_1)}{8\\\\mu} \\\\\\\\\\\\ u_2 & = \\\\frac{F_2(\\\\kappa+1)\\\\lnx_1}{4\\\\pi\\\\mu} + \\\\frac{F_1(\\\\kappa+1)\\\\text{sign}(x_1)}{8\\\\mu} \\\\end{align} where : \\\\kappa = \\\\begin{cases} 3 - 4 u & \\\\qquad \\\\text{plane strain} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\cfrac{3 - u}{1+ u} & \\\\qquad \\\\text{plane stress} \\\\end{cases} u is the Poisson's ratio, \\\\mu is the shear modulus, and : \\\\text{sign}(x) = \\\\begin{cases} +1 & x > 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & x < 0 \\\\end{cases}  Derivation of Flamant solution  If we assume the stresses to vary as (1/r), we can pick terms containing 1/r in the stresses from Michell's solution. Then the Airy stress function can be expressed as : \\\\varphi = C_1 r \\\\theta\\\\sin\\\\theta + C_2 r\\\\ln r \\\\cos\\\\theta + C_3 r \\\\theta\\\\cos\\\\theta + C_4 r\\\\ln r \\\\sin\\\\theta Therefore, from the tables in Michell's solution, we have :\\\\begin{align} \\\\sigma_{rr} & = C_1\\\\left(\\\\frac{2\\\\cos\\\\theta}{r}\\\\right) + C_2\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\cos\\\\theta}{r}\\\\right) + C_3\\\\left(\\\\frac{2\\\\sin\\\\theta}{r}\\\\right) + C_4\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sin\\\\theta}{r}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sigma_{r\\\\theta} & = C_2\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sin\\\\theta}{r}\\\\right) + C_4\\\\left(\\\\frac{-\\\\cos\\\\theta}{r}\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sigma_{\\\\theta\\\\theta} & = C_2\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\cos\\\\theta}{r}\\\\right) + C_4\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sin\\\\theta}{r}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} The constants C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4 can then, in principle, be determined from the wedge geometry and the applied boundary conditions. However, the concentrated loads at the vertex are difficult to express in terms of traction boundary conditions because # the unit outward normal at the vertex is undefined # the forces are applied at a point (which has zero area) and hence the traction at that point is infinite. Bounded elastic wedge for equilibrium of forces and moments. To get around this problem, we consider a bounded region of the wedge and consider equilibrium of the bounded wedge.Slaughter, W. S. (2002). The Linearized Theory of Elasticity. Birkhauser, Boston, p. 294. J. R. Barber, 2002, Elasticity: 2nd Edition, Kluwer Academic Publishers. Let the bounded wedge have two traction free surfaces and a third surface in the form of an arc of a circle with radius a\\\\,. Along the arc of the circle, the unit outward normal is \\\\mathbf{n} = \\\\mathbf{e}_r where the basis vectors are (\\\\mathbf{e}_r, \\\\mathbf{e}_\\\\theta). The tractions on the arc are : \\\\mathbf{t} = \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{n} \\\\quad \\\\implies t_r = \\\\sigma_{rr}, ~ t_\\\\theta = \\\\sigma_{r\\\\theta} ~. Next, we examine the force and moment equilibrium in the bounded wedge and get : \\\\begin{align} \\\\sum f_1 & = F_1 + \\\\int_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\beta} \\\\left[\\\\sigma_{rr}(a,\\\\theta)~\\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\- \\\\sigma_{r\\\\theta}(a,\\\\theta)~\\\\sin\\\\theta\\\\right]~a~d\\\\theta = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sum f_2 & = F_2 + \\\\int_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\beta} \\\\left[\\\\sigma_{rr}(a,\\\\theta)~\\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\+ \\\\sigma_{r\\\\theta}(a,\\\\theta)~\\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\right]~a~d\\\\theta = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\sum m_3 & = \\\\int_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\beta} \\\\left[a~\\\\sigma_{r\\\\theta}(a,\\\\theta)\\\\right]~a~d\\\\theta = 0 \\\\end{align} We require that these equations be satisfied for all values of a\\\\, and thereby satisfy the boundary conditions. The traction-free boundary conditions on the edges \\\\theta=\\\\alpha and \\\\theta=\\\\beta also imply that : \\\\sigma_{r\\\\theta} = \\\\sigma_{\\\\theta\\\\theta} = 0 \\\\qquad \\\\text{at}~~\\\\theta=\\\\alpha, \\\\theta=\\\\beta except at the point r = 0. If we assume that \\\\sigma_{r\\\\theta}=0 everywhere, then the traction-free conditions and the moment equilibrium equation are satisfied and we are left with : \\\\begin{align} F_1 & \\\\+ \\\\int_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\beta} \\\\sigma_{rr}(a,\\\\theta)~a~\\\\cos\\\\theta ~d\\\\theta = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ F_2 & \\\\+ \\\\int_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\beta} \\\\sigma_{rr}(a,\\\\theta)~a~\\\\sin\\\\theta ~d\\\\theta = 0 \\\\end{align} and \\\\sigma_{\\\\theta\\\\theta} = 0 along \\\\theta=\\\\alpha, \\\\theta=\\\\beta except at the point r = 0. But the field \\\\sigma_{\\\\theta\\\\theta} = 0 everywhere also satisfies the force equilibrium equations. Hence this must be the solution. Also, the assumption \\\\sigma_{r\\\\theta}=0 implies that C_2 = C_4 = 0. Therefore, : \\\\sigma_{rr} = \\\\frac{2C_1\\\\cos\\\\theta}{r} + \\\\frac{2C_3\\\\sin\\\\theta}{r} ~;~~ \\\\sigma_{r\\\\theta} = 0 ~;~~ \\\\sigma_{\\\\theta\\\\theta} = 0 To find a particular solution for \\\\sigma_{rr} we have to plug in the expression for \\\\sigma_{rr} into the force equilibrium equations to get a system of two equations which have to be solved for C_1, C_3: : \\\\begin{align} F_1 & \\\\+ 2\\\\int_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\beta} (C_1\\\\cos\\\\theta + C_3\\\\sin\\\\theta)~\\\\cos\\\\theta~ d\\\\theta = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ F_2 & \\\\+ 2\\\\int_{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\beta} (C_1\\\\cos\\\\theta + C_3\\\\sin\\\\theta)~\\\\sin\\\\theta~ d\\\\theta = 0 \\\\end{align} = Forces acting on a half-plane = If we take \\\\alpha = -\\\\pi and \\\\beta = 0, the problem is converted into one where a normal force F_2 and a tangential force F_1 act on a half-plane.

The highway runs from MD 6 at Riverside north to MD 227 at Pomonkey. MD 224 is a C-shaped route that mostly parallels the Potomac River through southwestern Charles County. The northern part of the highway passes through the villages of Chicamuxen, Rison, Marbury, and Mason Springs on the south side of Mattawoman Creek. MD 224 originally included Livingston Road north from Pomonkey through Accokeek, Piscataway, and Oxon Hill in southwestern Prince George's County to Washington. This highway connected Washington with Fort Washington and the Naval Proving Ground at Indian Head. MD 224 was constructed from Mason Springs north to Bryans Road and from Oxon Hill south to Piscataway in the early to mid-1920s. The highway was built from Mason Springs south to Rison in the mid-1920s and completed to its original southern terminus at Doncaster along what is now MD 344 in the late 1920s. MD 224 was completed when the portion through Accokeek was built in the early 1930s. The Riverside- Chicamuxen highway was constructed as MD 563, which began construction in the mid-1930s and was finished in the late 1940s. MD 224 north of Mason Springs was functionally replaced by the construction of what is now MD 210 during World War II and then removed from the state highway system in the mid-1950s. MD 224 replaced MD 563 from Chicamuxen to Riverside in the mid-1950s and was extended to its present northern terminus at Pomonkey in the early 1960s. Route description View south at the north end of MD 224 at MD 227 in Pomonkey MD 224 begins at an intersection with MD 6 (Port Tobacco Road) just north of the latter highway's western terminus at the Potomac River in Riverside. MD 224 heads west as two-lane undivided Riverside Road through densely forested southwestern Charles County, paralleling the left bank of the Potomac River about inland. Near Maryland Point, which is the southernmost point on the portion of Charles County around which the Potomac River flows, the state highway narrows from . West of Maryland Point Road, MD 224 temporarily narrows to . The highway crosses Thorne Gut and gradually curves to the north, then passes through Purse State Park. The highway widens from at its intersection with Liverpool Point Road west of Nanjemoy. The portion of MD 224 between MD 6 and Liverpool Point Road had an average annual daily traffic measure of 114 vehicles per day in 2011. MD 224 continues north parallel to the Potomac River and passes to the east of Mallows Bay. The highway follows Riverside Road to its northern end at Chicamuxen Road, which heads south as MD 344. MD 224 turns north onto Chicamuxen Road and veers east across Reeder Run and through the hamlet of Chicamuxen. MD 224 passes along the southern edge of Chicamuxen Wildlife Management Area and intersects Stump Neck Road, which leads to the Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division. The state highway passes through the villages of Rison, the site of Smallwood State Park, and Marbury, where the road crosses Marbury Run. The state highway passes through Mattawoman Natural Environmental Area, passes Henry E. Lackey High School, and intersects the northern end of MD 425 (Mason Springs Road) at Mason Springs before joining MD 225 (Hawthorne Road) to cross Mattawoman Creek. North of the creek, MD 224 turns east onto Livingston Road. The highway intersects the Indian Head Rail Trail and passing Maryland Airport before reaching its northern terminus at MD 227 (Pomfret Road) in the hamlet of Pomonkey. MD 227 continues north on Livingston Road toward Bryans Road. History Livingston Road follows much of the course of a road that has connected Charles County and the District of Columbia parallel to the eastern shore of the Potomac River through Prince George's County since the late 18th century. The road became more important as the highway connecting Washington with both Fort Washington and Fort Foote and later the Indian Head Naval Proving Ground, a gunpowder factory and testing area started by the federal government in the late 19th century. At its southern end at Mason Springs, Livingston Road was connected to Indian Head by the La Plata-Indian Head road that later became MD 225. At the District of Columbia boundary in what is now Forest Heights, Livingston Road continued north to Atlantic Street, which connected with Nichols Avenue (now Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue), which headed north to a crossing of the Anacostia River at the site of the 11th Street Bridges. The first segment of Livingston Road in Maryland to be paved as a modern highway was from the District of Columbia boundary south to Oxon Hill Road in Oxon Hill, which was paved by Prince George's County with state aid as a macadam road by 1910. According to the 1878 Hopkins regional Atlas, Livingston Road was so named because the road's District of Columbia section passed a large estate home owned by a Livingston, just before feeding into \\"Asylum Road\\" (present Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue) in today's Congress Heights. MD 224 southbound on Riverside Road near Chicamuxen The next section of what is now MD 224 to be improved was the short stretch across Mattawoman Creek on the La Plata-Indian Head road, which was built as a gravel road between 1916 and 1919 and later became MD 225. Livingston Road was improved as a gravel road from Oxon Hill south to Carey Branch south of Oxon Hill by 1921. By 1923, the highway extended south to Fort Washington Road at what was then the village of Silesia. That same year, another section of Livingston Road was graveled from the Charles-Prince George's county line southwest through Pomonkey to Mason Springs. The northern section of Livingston Road was extended south from Silesia to Old Fort Road between 1924 and 1926. The gravel road was extended from there to Piscataway between 1926 and 1928. MD 224 was extended south to Accokeek by 1930. The final piece of Livingston Road from Accokeek to the Charles-Prince George's county line was graveled starting in 1930 and completed by 1933. Chicamuxen Road was constructed as a gravel road from Mason Springs to Rison in 1923. That road was extended to Chicamuxen between 1924 and 1926. MD 224 was completed to its original southern terminus at MD 6 at Doncaster in 1929 and 1930. The first piece of MD 563 was constructed as a gravel road from MD 224 south to Sandy Point Road in 1934. The next portion of Riverside Road was a disjoint segment from Liverpool Point Road south to Smith Point Road in 1935. The two sections of MD 563 were united in 1936. The fourth segment of Riverside Road, from MD 6 at Riverside west to Maryland Point Road, was built by 1946. MD 563 was completed in 1947 and 1948 with the section of the highway between Maryland Point Road and Smith Point Road. MD 224 was marked from Doncaster to the District of Columbia by 1933. By 1934, MD 224 was proposed to be widened from from Oxon Hill to Piscataway. The need for upgrades to Livingston Road became acute by 1940 with the greatly increased activity at Fort Washington and the Indian Head Naval Powder Factory in the years before the United States entered World War II. Relief finally came in 1945 and 1946 when the mostly straight Indian Head Highway (now MD 210) was constructed between Washington and Indian Head, replacing the circuitous Livingston Road as the primary highway through the corridor. MD 224 throughout Prince George's County was transferred to county maintenance in 1954 except for the portion of Livingston Road in Accokeek that became part of MD 373. MD 224 was truncated again at its northern end in 1956 when the remaining Livingston Road portion of the state highway between Mason Springs and Pomonkey was transferred to Charles County maintenance; MD 227 took over the portion of Livingston Road from Pomonkey to Bryans Road as part of its extension north to Marshall Hall along what had been MD 226. At the same time, MD 224 was extended south along what had been MD 563 from Chicamuxen south to Riverside. The Chicamuxen-Doncaster portion of MD 224 was renumbered MD 344 by 1957. The present alignment of the MD 224-MD 225 concurrency and the bridge across Mattawoman Creek were constructed in 1956 and 1957. MD 224 was reconstructed and widened from Mason Springs through Marbury to Rison starting in 1956. The highway's reconstruction from Mason Springs to Rison and on to Chicamuxen was completed in 1959. Sections of the old highway at Mason Springs, Marbury, and Rison became segments of MD 865. The portion of Livingston Road between MD 225 and MD 227 was returned to the state highway system in 1963; MD 224 then assumed its current northern terminus at Pomonkey.

The Moondance Diner was a diner in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, located at 80 Sixth Avenue, between Grand Street and Canal Street. History The diner opened in 1933, when it was named the Holland Tunnel Diner. It could seat about 34 people, with six tables and ten counter stools. Like most diners of its vintage, it was built elsewhere and transported to its site. The entire structure was roughly thirty-six by sixteen feet. Circa 1997, it was purchased by Sunis Sharma. In 2007, it was announced that due to rising rent, the diner would be closing, and a demolition date of August 1 was set. Preservationists and the neighborhood's residents organized benefits for the diner. In mid-2007, the diner was donated by Extell Development Company to the American Diner Museum in Providence, Rhode Island, which put it up for sale on its website before the structure was moved. In August the diner was purchased from the museum for $7,500 by Vince and Cheryl Pierce and transported on the back of a semi-trailer truck to La Barge, Wyoming, at a cost of $40,000. However, shortly after the move, there were reports that the diner was unused and falling into dilapidation in its new site. During its first Wyoming winter, in January 2008, the diner's walls buckled and the entire roof caved in under the weight of ice and snow. The rotating moon sign, kept safe in storage, was undamaged. By March 2008, the diner was mostly repaired and restored, and was open for business six days a week. It was included in a late 2000s / early 2010s list of 51 \\"great burger joints\\" compiled by USA Today through reader suggestions. After a decline in trade due to a downturn in the local Wyoming gas drilling industry, the diner closed in March 2012, and by July was again put up for sale. While condominiums were announced to be built on the diner's former site in New York, the James Hotel went in instead. In popular culture *In the television sitcom Friends, the character Monica Geller (Courteney Cox) worked at the Moondance Diner, which was depicted as a 1950s theme restaurant with singing waitstaff (akin to the real-life Ellen's Stardust Diner).

PLoS ONE 11(1): e0147009. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0147009 Taxonomy The genus Tetralophodon (meaning \\"four-ridged tooth\\") was named in the mid-19th century with the discovery of the specialized teeth. Description Restoration Tetralophodon was an elephant-like animal which existed through the late Miocene to the Middle Pliocene epochs, approximately 10.9 million years. Like the gomphotheres, to which it was not closely related, Tetralophodon had four tusks and a trunk. They are believed to have been about tall at the shoulder and up to 10 tonnes in weight, larger than the size of the present Asian elephant, with a long trunk and incisors ranging up to long. These incisors are believed to have been used as a defense mechanism. The large, four-cusped cheek teeth of these animals are about by , about six times the size of a normal human tooth. These low-crowned, bunodont teeth were adapted for crushing and grinding, compared with other mammals during this era that had sharp teeth used for cutting. The teeth indicate a diet of large fruits and vegetables. This diet was aided by the large size and long trunks that enabled these mammals to reach tall, fruit-bearing trees. Some features, mainly concerning the teeth, would seem to place Tetralophodon close to the origin of today's elephants. The molars, in particular, are more advanced and specialized than those of the other gomphotheres. Distribution Fossil skull and tusks of T. longirostris, from Ballestar, Spain at the Museu Geol√≤gic del Seminari de Barcelona, Barcelona These animals were very widespread and successful proboscideans. Their fossils have been found from the late Miocene to the Middle Pliocene epochs of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Most fossil records of Tetralophodon are of four-ridged teeth. The North American species, T. campester and T. fricki, have been moved to the genus Pediolophodon in 2007. The majority of the gomphotheres became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene. While the reason for this extinction is still debated, what is known is that these massive elephantoids under the genus Tetralophodon did not survive.

Among his most famous works are La Leyenda de los Volcanes, La Leyenda, Popocapetl & Ixtaccihuatl, Hidalgo, \\"Rompiendo las Cadenas\\", El Aguila y la Serpiente, and Juan Diego y la Virgen de Guadalupe. Biography =Early life= Jes√∫s Enrique Emilio de la Helguera Espinoza was born to Spanish economist Alvaro Garcia Helguera and Maria Espinoza Escarzaga on May 28, 1910 in Chihuahua, Mexico. He lived his childhood in Mexico City and later moved to C√≥rdoba in the state of Veracruz. His family fled from the Mexican Revolution to Ciudad Real, Castilla la Nueva, Spain and thereafter moved to Madrid. Jes√∫s first gained interest in the arts during primary school and would often be found wandering the halls of the Del Prado Museum. At the age of 14, he was admitted to the Escuela Superior de Bellas Artes and later studied at the Academia de San Fernando. Helguera later married Julia Gonzalez Llanos, a native of Madrid, who modeled for many of his later paintings and with whom he raised two children. =Career= Jes√∫s first worked as an illustrator at the Editorial Araluce working on books, magazines and comics with many of his published works done in gouache. He became a professor of visual arts at a Bilboa Art Institute at the age of 18 and worked for magazines such as Estampa. Helguera was forced to move back to the Mexican state of Veracruz due to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War and following economic crisis. Upon his arrival, mural making was en vogue and he was hired by Cigarrera la Moderna, a tobacco company, to produce calendar artwork printed by Imprenta Galas de Mexico. Much of his work reflected his own fascination with Aztec Mythology, Catholicism, pin-up girls and the diverse Mexican landscape. His paintings showed an idealized Mexico and it was his romantic approach that gave his paintings the heroic impact that eventually made him famous. In 1940, he created what is arguably the most famous amongst his paintings, La Leyenda de los Volcanes, which was inspired by the legend of Popocat√©petl and Iztacc√≠huatl. It was later purchased by Ensenanza Objectiva, a producer of didactic images for schools. Many of his paintings would later be reproduced in a variety of different calendars and cigar boxes reaching households and businesses throughout Mexico. =Death and legacy= Helguera continued to paint privately and illustrate for various clients until his death on December 5, 1971. Jesus Helguera continues to be celebrated in Mexico, Spain and the United States.

She was one of six ex-United States Navy Barnegat-class small seaplane tenders/ex-United States Coast Guard Casco-class high endurance cutters received from the United States after the Vietnam War, two of which were acquired to supply spare parts for the other four. Andr√©s Bonifacio was considered the lead ship of her class in the Philippine Navy, and she and her three commissioned sister ships were the largest Philippine Navy combat ships of their time. In July 2016, a newer frigate received by the Philippine navy from the US navy was also named BRP Andres Bonifacio (FF-17). History =Construction and United States Navy service 1943‚Äì1946= as USS Chincoteague (AVP-24) circa 1945 Andr√©s Bonifacio was built in the United States by Lake Washington Shipyard at Houghton, Washington, as the United States Navy Barnegat-class seaplane tender . Commissioned in April 1943, she operated in support of the New Guinea campaign and in the Central Pacific during World War II and operated at Okinawa and in China after the war. She was decommissioned in December 1946 and placed in reserve. =United States Coast Guard service 1949‚Äì1972= as USCGC Chincoteague (WAVP-375) circa 1964 In 1949 the U.S. Navy loaned Chincoteague to the United States Coast Guard, in which she was commissioned as the Casco- class Coast Guard cutter USCGC Chincoteague (WAVP-375). She was reclassified as a high endurance cutter, redesignated WHEC-375, and transferred permanently from the Navy to the Coast Guard in 1966. Her primary duty was to patrol ocean stations in the North Atlantic Ocean, providing weather data and engaging in search-and-rescue and law-enforcement operations. The Coast Guard decommissioned her in June 1972. =Republic of Vietnam Navy service 1972‚Äì1975= Due to the Vietnamization Program of the United States Government, Chincoteague was transferred to South Vietnam in June 1972 and was commissioned into the Republic of Vietnam Navy as patrol vessel . She participated in the Battle of the Paracel Islands against ships of the People's Republic of China on 19 January 1974. When South Vietnam collapsed at the end of the Vietnam War in late April 1975, L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát fled to Subic Bay in the Philippines, packed with South Vietnamese refugees. On 22 May 1975 and 23 May 1975, a U.S. Coast Guard team inspected L√Ω Th∆∞·ªùng Ki·ªát and five of her sister ships, which also had fled to the Philippines in April 1975. One of the inspectors noted: \\"These vessels brought in several hundred refugees and are generally rat-infested. They are in a filthy, deplorable condition.

Technical details There were changes made to the Andr√©s Bonifacio class as compared to their original design during its service with the US Navy, US Coast Guard and the Republic of Vietnam Navy. The ships were passed to the Philippine Navy with fewer weapons on-board and old surface search radars, and these were addressed later on by the Philippine Navy through modernization programs, including the addition of a helicopter landing pad in 1979. The single Mk. 12 5-inch/38-caliber (127 mm) gun was Andr√©s Bonifacios primary weapon. It was mounted in a Mark 30 Mod 0 enclosed base ring and had a range of up to yards. The gun was a dual-purpose type, capable of both antisurface and antiair warfare. She also carried a two twin Mk. 1 Bofors 40mm L/60 anti- aircraft guns and two single Bofors 40mm L/60 anti-aircraft guns, four twin 20mm Oerlikon cannons, four M2 Browning .50-caliber (12.7-mm) general-purpose machine guns, and two 81mm mortars.DLSU N-ROTC Office.

At one all-candidates' meeting Dukszta held up a hand- made pink triangle and a yellow star to illustrate the danger he saw in anti- homosexual sentiment being used against New Democrats. \\"I saw this sort of thing in Poland during the war, when the Germans made homosexuals wear pink triangles and Jews had to wear the star,\\" Dukszta told the Globe and Mail saying of the anti-gay organizations \\"These groups are dangerous.... It is the start of fascism.... Are we going to go through another McCarthy period when minorities will be attacked allegedly in the name of the moral majority?\\" Dukszta claimed he was also the target of a smear campaign that falsely accused the psychiatrist of being an abortionist. \\"Some of their canvassers were saying I was doing abortions in the back room. Our canvassers were hearing it.\\" Dukszta helped write the NDPs health and education policy. As a member of the NDP caucus he served as critic for housing and, subsequently, for culture and recreation. Dukszta had also taken time out of his re-election campaign to treat fellow NDP MPP Tony Lupusella who had suffered a nervous breakdown and was unable to campaign but was nevertheless re-elected by 231 votes. After politics Dukszta returned to psychiatric practice following his defeat and, by 1986, was head of medical staff at Queen Street Mental Health Centre in Toronto. Since retired, he still sees private patients. Dukszta is dedicated to the arts, the visual arts in particular. Over his almost half-century living in Canada he has purchased and commissioned hundreds of works of art, many of which have been donated to museums and galleries. In particular, many of the commissioned works include portraits of himself in a variety of poses. In 1985, he had collected about 30 such pieces which were displayed in his Rosedale apartment. In 2010, the University of Toronto Art Centre held an exhibition entitled Portrait of a Patron that showcased artwork that Dukszta had commissioned since 1953.

The Tikkun HaKlali is a unique innovation of Rebbe Nachman of Breslov, and its recital is a regular practice of Breslover Hasidim to this day. Form The Tikkun HaKlali consists of the following ten Psalms said in this order: 16, 32, 41, 42, 59, 77, 90, 105, 137, and 150. Each recital is preceded by a paragraph expressing one's desire to bind himself to the tzadikim of all generations, especially Rebbe Nachman, and several verses which are customarily recited before any saying of Psalms. The recital of the ten Psalms is followed by a prayer composed by Reb Noson, the Rebbe's foremost disciple, asking God for forgiveness from sin. History Rebbe Nachman first revealed the existence of a rectification for involuntary nocturnal emissions in 1805. At that time, he stated that any ten Psalms would serve as a rectification, since they correspond to the ten expressions of song and praise on which the Book of Psalms is based. These ten types of song are: Ashrei, Beracha, Maskil, Nitzuach, Shir, Niggun, Mizmor, Tefilla, Hoda'ah, and Halleluyah.Pesachim 117a; Zohar III, 101a. In that lesson, Rebbe Nachman explained how some of these expressions stand in direct opposition to the kelipah (forces of evil), and therefore have the power to extract the wasted seed from the realm of unholiness.Likutey Moharan I, 205. Rebbe Nachman's main teaching on Tikkun HaKlaliLikutey Moharan I, 29. was given on Shavuot 5566 (May 23, 1806). Yet he did not reveal the specific ten Psalms of the Tikkun HaKlali until April 1810. At that time, Rebbe Nachman revealed the specific ten Psalms to two of his closest disciples, Rabbi Aharon of Breslov and Rabbi Naftali of Nemirov, making them witnesses for an unprecedented vow: > \\"Bear witness to my words: When my days are over and I leave this world, I > will still intercede for anyone who comes to my grave, says these ten > Psalms, and gives a penny to charity. No matter how great his sins, I will > do everything in my power, spanning the length and breadth of the creation > to cleanse and protect him. > \\"I am very positive in everything I say. But I am most positive in regard to > the great benefit of these ten Psalms. > \\"These are the ten Psalms: 16, 32, 41, 42, 59, 77, 90, 105, 137, 150. > \\"This is the General Remedy. There is a specific remedy for each sin, but > this is the general remedy. > \\"Go out and spread the teaching of the ten Psalms to all men. > \\"It may seem like an easy thing to say ten Psalms. But it will actually be > very difficult in practice.\\"Rabbi Nachman's Wisdom #141. In the accompanying lesson, in which he enumerated and discussed the allusions of the specific ten Psalms, Rebbe Nachman asserted: > Know that the ten Psalms which a person must recite on the very same day as > he has an impure experience, God forbid, are: 16, 32, 41, 42, 59, 77, 90, > 105, 137, 150. These ten Psalms are a very great remedy for this problem. > One who is worthy of saying them on the same day need have no more fear > whatsoever of the terrible blemish caused by an impure emission, because it > has indubitably been corrected by this remedy without any doubt.Likutey > Moharan II, 92. Mystical meaning The Tikkun HaKlali is based on the idea of the Brit (Covenant) which God made with the Jewish people. In return for absolute allegiance to God on the part of the nation, God promised to be their God and to give them the land of Israel as an inheritance (Genesis 17:7-8). As a mark of this Covenant, God commanded Abraham to perform the mitzvah of brit milah (circumcision): > \\"This is My Covenant which you shall keep between Me and you and your seed > after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised. And you shall be > circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be a token of a > Covenant between Me and you.\\" (Genesis 17:10-11) By choosing this specific organ to bear the sign of the Covenant, God indicated the tremendous power of the sexual organ. When it is used in the context of marriage, the sexual organ is elevated and man becomes a partner with God in creation. But when it is used for personal gratification, it distances a person from God and leaves him unfulfilled, frustrated and depressed. Rebbe Nachman taught that the antithesis of the joy one should feel by uniting with a marriage partner and performing all of God's other mitzvot is depression, a state which is in the domain of Lilith, the name of the kelipah associated with unholiness. The Tikkun HaKlali comes to rectify the sin of misusing the sexual organ and, by extension, undoes the root feelings of depression that lie at the core of any sin. It does this through the power of Psalms (Tehillim in Hebrew), which are songs of praise and rejoicing in God. The word Tehillim has the same gematria as the word Lilith (with five units added for each of the letters of Lilith). Moreover, the word Tehillim has the same gematria as the two names of God, El and Elohim, which have the power to release the seed from the kelipah. Thus, by reciting these ten Psalms, the wasted seed is released from the forces of evil and rectification is complete. Other rectifications Although the sin of wasted seed is considered the most serious of the violations of the Covenant, other sins also accomplish the same thing. Rebbe Nachman taught that one who earns his livelihood dishonestly also breaches the Covenant, as his craving for money can make him go so far as to rob his fellow man.Likutey Moharan I, 22:5 The way one thinks, speaks and acts are also areas in which he can uphold or damage the Covenant. Rebbe Nachman further taught that the Tikkun HaKlali can rectify all spiritual and physical flaws or maladies. He stated, > \\"There are places that are so fine and narrow that no remedy has the power > to penetrate them except through the General Remedy, which injects healing > into even the narrowest, finest places. First it is necessary to apply the > General Remedy, and through this all the individual flaws will automatically > be rectified.\\"Likutey Moharan I, 29:4,10. For this reason, many Breslover Hasidim recite the Tikkun HaKlali every day. Women also recite it as a general rectification for sin.https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/breslov1.html Breslov Judaism: Questions and Answers.

Conditions before independence African access to educational opportunities was highly limited for most of the colonial period. Until the 1950s, facilities run by the government were few and largely restricted to urban areas. Responsibility for educating Africans rested with Roman Catholic and Protestant missions. As a consequence, each of the missions established its own school system, although all were subject to ultimate control by the Portuguese with respect to certain policy matters.Warner, Rachel. \\"Conditions before Independence\\". A Country Study: Angola (Thomas Collelo, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (February 1989). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Education beyond the primary level was available to very few Africans before 1960, and the proportion of the age group that went on to secondary school in the early 1970s was still quite low. Nevertheless, primary school attendance was growing substantially. Whether those entering primary schools were acquiring at least functional literacy in Portuguese was another matter. Primary school consisted of a total of four years made up of a pair of two year cycles. Portuguese statistics do not indicate how many students completed each of the cycles, but it is estimated that far fewer completed the full four years than entered the first cycle. Similarly, there seems to be general agreement among observers that a great number of those who entered secondary school did not complete it. In general, the quality of teaching at the primary level was low, with instruction carried on largely by Africans with very few qualifications. Most secondary school teachers were Portuguese, but the first years of secondary school were devoted to materials at the primary level. Conditions after Independence The conflict between the Portuguese and the various nationalist movements and the civil war that ensued after independence left the education system in chaos. Most Portuguese instructors had left (including virtually all secondary school staff), many buildings had been damaged, and the availability of instructional materials was limited.Warner, Rachel. \\"Conditions after Independence\\". A Country Study: Angola (Thomas Collelo, editor). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (February 1989). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. A report of the First Party Congress published in December 1977 gave education high priority. The report emphasized Marxism-Leninism as a base for the education system and its importance in shaping the \\"new generation,\\" but the objectives of developing national consciousness and respect for traditional values were also mentioned. The training at all levels of persons who would be able to contribute to economic development was heavily stressed. The government estimated the level of illiteracy following independence at between 85 percent and 90 percent and set the elimination of illiteracy as an immediate task. Initiated in November 1976, the literacy drive gave priority to rural peasants who had been completely ignored by the Portuguese education system. The priorities for education were, in order of importance, literacy, primary education, secondary education, and intermediate and university education. The government established the National Literacy Commission (under the leadership of the minister of education) to administer the literacy campaign. The government reported that in the first year of the literacy campaign (November 1976 to November 1977) 102,000 adults learned to read and write; by 1980 the figure had risen to 1 million. By 1985 the average rate of adult literacy was officially estimated at 59 percent; United States government sources, however, estimated literacy at only 20 percent. In late 1987, Angola's official press agency, Angop, reported that the provinces with the most newly literate people included Hu√≠la, Huambo, and Benguela and that 8,152 literacy teachers had participated in the campaign since its inception. At independence there were 25,000 primary school teachers, but less than 2,000 were even minimally qualified to teach primary school children. The shortage of qualified instructors was even more pronounced at the secondary school level, where there were only 600 teachers. Furthermore, secondary schools existed only in towns. The First Party Congress responded to this problem by resolving to institute an eight-year compulsory system of free, basic education for children between ages seven and fifteen. Four years of primary education, provided free of charge, began at age seven. Secondary education, beginning at age eleven, lasted a further six years. School enrollment, which rose very slowly considering Angola's youthful population, reflected the dire effects of the insurgency. In 1977 the government reported that more than 1 million primary school students were enrolled, as were about 105,000 secondary school students, roughly double the numbers enrolled in 1973. What proportions of the relevant age groups these students constituted was not known, but in the case of the primary school students it may have been almost two-thirds, and in that of secondary school students, perhaps a tenth to an eighth. Official government statistics released in 1984 showed that primary school enrollment had declined to 870,410, while secondary school enrollment (including vocational school and teacher training students) had increased to 151,759. This made for combined primary and secondary school enrollment consisting of 49 percent of the school-age population. By 1986 the primary school enrollment had increased to 1,304,145. Luanda's Agostinho Neto University, the country's only university, had an enrollment of 4,493 students in 1984, which had declined to 3,195 by 1986. A total of 72,330 people were enrolled in primary adult education programs in 1986. The government began implementation of its education plan in close cooperation with its allies, particularly Cuba. Between 1978 and 1981, Cuba sent 443 teachers to Angola. According to an Angolan source, in 1987 an estimated 4,000 Angolan students, representing one- fourth of all foreign students from Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean studying in Cuba, were attending Cuban elementary, middle, and college preparatory schools, as well as polytechnical institutes and the Superior Pedagogical Polytechnic Institute. Also in Cuba, assisting in the education of their compatriots, was a group of twenty-seven Angolan teachers. In addition, the Soviet Union participated in Angolan education programs. More than 1,000 Angolan students had graduated from intermediate and specialized higher education programs in the Soviet Union by the end of 1987, at which time 100 Soviet lecturers were teaching at Agostinho Neto University, the Luanda Naval School, and the Institute of Geology and Cartography in the Angolan capital. By mid-1988 United States sources reported that 1,800 Angolan students were studying in the Soviet Union. A number of Angolan organizations become active during the 1980s in the quest for better educational facilities.In 1987 the JMPLA launched a special campaign to recruit 1,000 young people to teach in primary schools in Luanda Province. The groups targeted by the campaign included secondary school and higher education graduates, as well as some workers. The OMA not only sponsored programs to teach women to read and write but was also involved in programs to reduce infant mortality and promote family planning. Even the military formed a special group in 1980, the eighth contingent of the Comrade Dangereux Brigade, whose basic function was to teach primary school; 6,630 brigade members were reported to have taught 309,419 students by 1987. Despite the government's efforts, the UNITA insurgency prevented the construction of a new education system on the remains of that inherited from the Portuguese. The demands of the war had drained funds that could otherwise have been applied to building schools, printing books, and purchasing equipment. In 1988, according to the United States Center for Defense Information, the Angolan government spent more per capita on the military (US$892) than on education (US$310). The war in the southern and central regions of the country also prevented the spread of the school system; the consequences of the fighting, including UNITA attacks on schools and teachers and the massive displacement of rural populations in those areas, disrupted the education of hundreds of thousands of school-age children. Further damaging to Angola's future was the fact that many of those studying abroad had either failed to complete their courses of study or had not returned to Angola.

It is part of the North Port-Bradenton-Sarasota, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. History The area originally was assembled in 1905 by John Schroeder as Schroeder-Manatee Ranch (SMR). The land was purchased by members of Milwaukee's Uihlein family in 1922 for ranch operations such as timber and cattle. In 1977, the Sarasota Manatee Airport Authority announced intentions to build a new airport near the Sarasota- Manatee county line about east of its current location, linking to future Interstate 75. The airport authority struck down the idea in 1985 and expanded the existing airport facility. The airport proposal and the construction of Interstate 75 resulted in SMR's board of directors to pursue creating a planned community for the land. In the 1980s, SMR designed a destination resort project called Cypress Banks. The project consisted of and included 5,000 mixed residential units, three golf courses, and a 300-room hotel. The project and development of regional impact (DRI) were initially denied by Manatee County in 1987 but later approved in December 1989. The project never broke ground and SMR maintained vested rights to the land. The first neighborhood development, Summerfield, was built and completed in 1995. Government Lakewood Ranch was established as a development of regional impact (DRI), as defined in Section 380.06 of the Florida Statutes, in December 1989. The master-planned community is maintained through the Lakewood Ranch Stewardship District and five community development districts (CDD) within the District. The District was established on June 14, 2005 by the Florida legislature. The District encompasses within Manatee and Sarasota counties. The CDDs main powers are to plan, finance, construct, operate, and maintain community-wide infrastructure and services specifically for the benefit of its residents.

It was founded in 1971 and is based in Toluca, Mexico State, Mexico; its home hall is Sala Felipe Villanueva.  History  On August 27, 1971, under the initiative of Enrique B√°tiz Campbell and the government of the Mexico State, the Orquesta Sinf√≥nica del Estado de M√©xico (OSEM) was founded. Its purpose is the spreading of music as an art, to create unity and identity among the citizens of the state. The orchestra is located in the city of Toluca, and its home hall is the Sala Felipe Villanueva. The Orchestra has been characterized by its endeavor to carry its message to all the municipalities of the state, to all corners of the country. It was also the first institution of its kind to visit the 16 political divisions of the Federal District. It began giving concerts in the main settings of the capital of the country, from the Bellas Artes theater and National Auditorium to the Sala Nezahualcoyotls, as well as other halls in the outlying areas, such as the San Benito Abad theater of the Centro Escolar del Lago, in the municipality of Cuautitl√°n, which, in spite of its location-40 kilometers from the center of the city-rose in popularity for the metropolitan public, due to the area and the admirable acoustic conditions and the comfort of the hall. The OSEM performed at the Fourth Festival of the Historic Center of Campeche, and the following year at the Orchestral Festival organized by the National Council for Culture and Arts. For 6 years, the orchestra carried out a Festival in Valle de Bravo, in the state of Mexico, showing through it how excellent art can be when it is the result of a joint effort of the living forces of the country. Between 1983 and 1985, the orchestra was under the direction of maestro Manuel Su√°rez, and later, until 1989, Eduardo Diaz Mu√±oz.  Tours  In 1975, the OSEM made its first tour to the United States, returning continuously for three years, starting in 1979, playing in the most important cities. In 2002, it toured for the first time in Germany. In 2003, a European Tour led the orchestra to Spain, Poland, Germany and France. In 2005, the orchestra traveled to Paris, France and offered two concerts, one in Salle Gaveau and the other in Theater Mogador, with extraordinary success. In September 2005, the OSEM traveled to the People's Republic of China to offer six concerts in the most important cities of this country, including Changsha, Shanghai, Shenyang, Harbin and Beijing. In 2008 the OSEM was invited by Colombia Artists Management to play a 49 concert tour of the USA last more than nine weeks. Concerts were performed all over the US, including New York, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Illinois, Iowa, California, and Nevada. In 2010 the OSEM and Enrique Batiz performed two concerts in Granada, Spain, which were broadcast live and recorded for DVD video release.  Contributions to the performing community  The promotion of new musical talents has been an objective of the orchestra since its beginnings. It has given rise to over forty excellent soloists, and also participated in the discovery and encouragement of young performers, through the \\"International Henryk Szeryng Violin Contest\\", begun in 1992. In the four times this contest was held, the OSEM enjoyed the presence of the most notable aspiring violinists of the world, and rewarded a dozen of them. The OSEM has also hosted many guest directors and soloists, chosen from the most outstanding in the world. An accomplishment of the OSEM, assisted by the Trust Foundation, has been the institutionalization of the Festival Valle de Bravo year after year, since 1997. Concerts of this festival take place in the town in Valle de Bravo as well as in the theater of Bellas Artes in Mexico City.  Recordings  The recordings of the OSEM cover the broadest range of any Mexican orchestra. They include recordings dedicated to the works of Verdi and Rossini, Mexican and Spanish music, the works of Isaac Alb√©niz, Joaqu√≠n Rodrigo, Manuel M. Ponce and Carlos Ch√°vez, and the integral series of the symphonies of Ludwig van Beethoven, Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.  Awards  Both the orchestra and its artistic director have repeatedly received the Annual Award from the Mexican Union of Chroniclers of Theater and Music, given for its 25th anniversary by the First Festival of Classical Music in 1996 with the participation of other orchestras in the country, as well as for its promotion of musical activities in Mexico.

Bush, 752 F. Supp. 1141 (D.D.C. 1990), was a D.C. Federal District Court decision by United States District Judge Harold H. Greene, denying the plaintiffs, members of Congress, a preliminary injunction against President George H.W. Bush to stop implementation of his orders directing the United States military to fight in Iraq without first obtaining a declaration of war from Congress, the only branch Constitutionally mandated to declare war.Article I, Section 8, clause 11, U.S. Constitution. Fifty four members of Congress, including U.S. Representative Ron Dellums, sued George H.W. Bush in 1990 attempting to halt a preemptive military buildup in the Middle East in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The plaintiff members of Congress asserted that military action without a declaration of war would be unlawful under U.S. Const. art. I, ¬ß 8, cl. 11 of the United States Constitution. The District Court held that, although the plaintiff's claims were plausible, because the President had not yet initiated war-like actions and only 54 members of Congress (53 members of the House and one member of the Senate) were involved in the suit, and not a majority, the dispute was not ripe for adjudication at that time. Accordingly the motion for preliminary injunction was denied. Dellums is notable in that it is one of only a few cases in which the Federal Courts have considered whether the War Powers Clause of the U.S. Constitution is justiciable in the courts. The Court in Dellums indicated that, in that instance, it was, but because Congress had not yet acted as a majority, the lawsuit was premature. The reasoning used in Dellums has not escaped criticism by some authors as an intrusion on executive power.

Description The book outlines \\"17 simple rules of financial safety\\" and provides detailed commentary on their explanation and implementation. The chapter for Rule #11 is called \\"Build a Bullet Proof Portfolio for Protection\\" and makes a case for a diversified investment portfolio of stocks, bonds, cash and gold to ensure financial safety. According to the author this type of portfolio has the goal of assuring \\"that you are financially safe, no matter what the future brings\\" including economic prosperity, inflation, recession or deflation.Browne, Harry (1999) Fail-Safe Investing: Lifelong Financial Security in 30 Minutes, pp 39-42 According to the book this is because some portion of the portfolio will perform favorably during each of those economic cycles. The book calls this type of investment portfolio, a \\"permanent portfolio\\" and advocates it be re- balanced once per year so that the 25% allocation is precisely maintained for each asset class. The breakdown is as follows Analysis of Harry Browne's portfolio at Get Rich Slowly 20 April 2009 * 25% in U.S. stocks, to provide a strong return during times of prosperity. For this portion of the portfolio, Browne recommends a basic S&P; 500 index fund such as VFINX (closed to new investors since publication, replaced by VFIAX, which is also Vanguard 500 Index fund) or FSMKX (Fidelity Spartan 500 Index). * 25% in long-term U.S. Treasury bonds, which do well during prosperity and during deflation (but which do poorly during other economic cycles). * 25% in cash in order to hedge against periods of ‚Äútight money‚Äù or recession. In this case, ‚Äúcash‚Äù means U.S.Treasury bills. * 25% in precious metals (gold) in order to provide protection during periods of inflation. Browne recommends gold bullion coins. According to Browne such a permanent portfolio should be safe, simple and stable. Authors Craig Rowland and J. M. Lawson call it a passive style of investing. Reception The concept of a permanent portfolio, as described in the book, has received significant attention and discussion in the financial community. The book has popularized this portfolio strategy for individual investors whose goal to safeguard their investments during changing economic conditions. Advocates have cited the strategy's \\"solid performance\\" during the first decade of the 21st century including the period of the 2008 financial crisis as an indication that the strategy is beneficial. Author Mark Tier, called it a \\"well-thought-out investment strategy that successfully applies diversification to the aim of not just preserving capital, but increasing that capital's purchasing power over time\\". The book has been described as \\"long on theory but short on actual details\\" for implementation of its investment philosophy. Critics questioned its ability to outperform the S&P; 500 index in a future era of rising interest rates. They have pointed out that since its inception in 1982 the Permanent Fund Portfolio mutual fund, which utilizes the permanent portfolio principles outlined in the book, has had inferior performance when compared to the S&P; 500. However the Permanent Portfolio is a widely diversified investment strategy so a comparison to a pure stock portfolio is an inaccurate benchmark. Historically for instance, the Permanent Portfolio has around 1/4th the volatility of the S&P; 500\\\\. According to an article in The Globe and Mail, the permanent portfolio approach is more of an \\"investment idea\\" rather than an \\"exact blueprint\\" for an investor's portfolio.

Early life  Sim was born in Mangaweka in the Manawat≈´-Whanganui region, and attended Oroua Downs School. His artistic talents were discovered at Palmerston North Technical School, where from the age of 14 he learned under H. Linley Richardson. Richardson had him learn by copying other artists, including old masters and Charles F Goldie. Sim later worked as a \\"well diviner,\\" choosing the best place to dig a well, in the Manawatu in the 1950s. He also used his artistic skills working as a signwriter.  Forgery  Sim noticed his art from school being auctioned off as originals of other artists, and from there started forging on purpose. He would forge artists such as Frances Hodgkins, Colin McCahon, and Charles F Goldie, He started selling forged paintings and drawings in his 40s, out of his antique and wine shop in Foxton. By selling the artwork through his shop, it created provenance, bolstering the claim of authenticity. By signing the artist's name on the pictures, he sold them as original, genuine pieces of art. He even managed to sell off a van Dyck for around $600. Eventually the amount of art coming out of his shop raised suspicions, and the police raided it and arrested him in 1985. Sim had gotten caught with spelling mistakes in some signatures, specifically with van der Velden forgeries where he capitalized the v in van, as well as signing one painting \\"Veldon.\\" He was convicted of 40 counts of forgery and sentenced to 200 hours community service and a fine of $1,000. Afterward he changed his name to Carl Feoder Goldie, so he could legally sign his work as CF Goldie. Following his conviction he continued to forge art, using associates to sell his forgeries through auction houses in New Zealand, Australia and the United Kingdom until shortly before his death. He was responsible for a set of six forged artworks attributed to Paul Gauguin displayed at an Auckland exhibition in 2000. Though one auctioneer claims his fakes were obvious and wouldn't fool experts since he used the same techniques and pigments in his forgeries.  Later life  Sim was guest of honor at the inaugural 'Mangaweka Fakes & Forgeries Festival' held in 2007 in his birth town. He appeared again as prize presenter in 2011 at the now two yearly event, and was planned to appear at the 2013 event in November, before his death in October of that year. In 2007, he was named the 8th greatest art forger in the world. He wrote a book in 2003, called Good As Goldie (), later republished as C F Goldie and the Creative Art of Forgery (). He died on 21 October 2013 at North Shore Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand. A couple purchased his old flat and turned it in an antique shop named Goldie's Junk 'N Disorderly to keep his legacy alive.

All she wants, is to fall in love and have a family, even if it means giving up her Immortality. The worst happens, when Han discovers that Cai-Sheng killed his master and wouldn't tell him, though he later understands why.

Regional interests focus on Chinese society, especially in Taiwan, with a secondary interest in pre-Columbian Mexico. Jordan has published on language, social structure, folk religion, and sectarianism in Taiwan and China and has written in and about Esperanto and the social movements associated with it and the associated area of interlinguistics. Jordan is a researcher in Chinese Anthropology as well as Ethnographic Christianity research. Even after retirement, Jordan continued to work at the University with his last post as the Interim Provost of Sixth College. Jordan continues to teach both undergraduate and graduate courses at his home institution in the Departments of Anthropology as well as Eleanor Roosevelt College's \\"Making of the Modern World\\" sequence.Jordan: Main Web Page =Chinese Anthropology= Jordan's research focused on Chinese Popular Religion, and Traditional Chinese Culture. Jordan also teaches and founded these courses in the Department of Anthropology at University of California, San Diego.http://infopath-1.ucsd.edu/catalog/courses/ANTH.html =Chinese Studies= Jordan was one of the founders of the Chinese Studies Program at UC San Diego, where he served as the Program Director and still remains as an affiliated faculty. He also created a very large database on Chinese culture and society with an emphasis on an anthropological view on his personal website which includes detailed contents on almost all aspects of the traditional Chinese life.http://anthro.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/chin/china.html Jordan's research in Chinese Studies focused on an ethnographic study in Taiwan,http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/afs/pdf/a296.pdfhttp://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/books/jordan- minor-preface.pdf in which he produced a general integrated picture of rural Taiwanese religious life for the first time in English. He also produced ethnographically based accounts of Chinese sworn siblinghood and traditional matchmaking, long-term Chinese traditions that had had little ethnographic study. Jordan is also known for his research on the topic of Chinese Ghost Marriage.http://www.religionfacts.com/chinese_religion/beliefs/spirits.htm =Ethnographic Christianity= Jordan also did much research in the field of Ethnographic Christianity. He teaches the course to the Ph.D students at UC San Diego in preparation for these students' field work in Christianized portions of the world. His research in this field include:http://weber.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/xy/xybibliography.html * Christianity as a Religious Organization * The Historical Jesus * The Early Church * The Mythological Traditions * Historical & Ethnographic Variations: (General Histories, Comparative Studies, Asia, Latin America, Anglophone America, Africa, Europe) * The \\"Scientific Study\\" of Religion Visiting Professorships Jordan was a visiting professor at Harvard University in the summer of 1974 and at San Francisco State University several summers.

The station also has a low power repeater in Watertown, New York which broadcasts with 50 watts. The audio from this station can be heard on Time Warner Cable in Watertown, New York on channel 96. Time Warner picks up the broadcast from repeater 104.1 which is also in Watertown. Since the FM audio subcarrier for cable channel 96 can be heard on 101.75 FM, cable subscribers in the greater Watertown area can hear WLFK in a much larger area than its low powered Watertown signal can cover. Owned and operated by Community Broadcasters, LLC, it broadcasts a country format. The station carries a national news feed from CNN at the top of each hour. The station has a local disc jockey, Wolfman Bill, (weekdays 6-9am), and local news courtesy of John Moore at WWTI-TV 50 (Watertown, New York). The remainder of the schedule is filled by satellite, with no local news after that. The station broadcasts Clarkson University hockey. The announcer is Bob Ahlfeld. Station history WLFK signed-on for the first time on Monday evening, December 4, 1967, as WIGS-FM on 92.7 MHz. The 3,000-watt station was put on- the-air to provide coverage to areas that were unable to receive the signal of (or received interference with) the 1,000-watt WIGS (AM) 1230 (now defunct). The two stations simulcasted originally. In the fall of 1977, the FM station changed call letters to WLUF. The callsign was changed back to WIGS-FM on December 18, 1978. At noon on February 25, 1981, WIGS-FM moved to its current frequency of 95.3 MHz to make room at Ogdensburg, New York for WPAC (now WQTK). In later years, the simulcast ended, with the AM side going country and the FM taking on an adult contemporary format. The station callsign changed to WGIX-FM on July 1, 1988. In February 1991, both stations suddenly left the air but returned with new owners that fall. The Wireless Works had already owned WSLB and WPAC in Ogdensburg, as well as WZOZ in Oneonta, New York. In recent years, The Wireless Works formed an all-oldies trimulcast of WSLB/WIGS/WGIX as \\"FSR Full Service Radio.\\" WIGS signed off permanently in the mid-1990s, and the two remaining stations continued a simulcast until WSLB became \\"Talk 1400\\" in the early part of this decade. WGIX became \\"Oldies 95.3\\" then \\"Cool 95.3.\\" In 2003, WGIX-FM added a 50-watt repeater in Watertown, New York which was formerly used by Majic 103.1. Then in 2008, the station added a 19-watt repeater in Lowville. On Tuesday, March 9, 2010, the station switched formats to country music, re-branding itself as WLFK, \\"95-3 The Wolf\\", and changing the callsign to match.

The campaign was one of several clashes between the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps and the Black Flag Army during the Tonkin campaign (1883‚Äì1886), and took place during the period of undeclared hostilities that preceded the Sino-French War (August 1884‚ÄìApril 1885).Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 170‚Äì77; Histoire militaire, 68‚Äì72  Background  Following the defeat and death of the French naval captain Henri Rivi√®re at the Battle of Paper Bridge on 19 May 1883 at the hands of Liu Yongfu and the Black Flag Army, the French government sent substantial reinforcements to Tonkin. General Alexandre-Eug√®ne Bou√´t (1833‚Äì87), Rivi√®re's successor, attempted to destroy the Black Flag Army in the summer and autumn of 1883, but although the Black Flags suffered substantial losses in the Battle of Ph·ªß Ho√†i (15 August) and the Battle of Palan (1 September), the French failed to defeat them decisively. In October 1883 command of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps was given to Admiral Am√©d√©e Courbet. The French now prepared for a major offensive at the end of the year to annihilate the Black Flags, and tried to persuade China to withdraw its support for Liu Yongfu, while attempting to win the support of the other European powers for the projected offensive. Jules Ferry and the French foreign minister Paul-Armand Challemel-Lacour met a number of times in the summer and autumn of 1883 with the Chinese minister Marquis Zeng Jize in Paris, but these diplomatic discussions proved abortive.Eastman, 85‚Äì7 The Chinese stood firm, and refused to withdraw substantial garrisons of Chinese regular troops from S∆°n T√¢y, B·∫Øc Ninh and L·∫°ng S∆°n, despite the likelihood that they would be shortly engaged in battle against the French. In turn, the French consolidated their hold on the Delta by establishing posts at Qu·∫£ng Y√™n, H∆∞ng Y√™n and Ninh B√¨nh. In December 1883 Admiral Courbet was authorised by Ferry's government to attack S∆°n T√¢y. The French cabinet accepted that an attack on Liu Yongfu would probably result in an undeclared war with China, but calculated that a quick victory in Tonkin would force the Chinese to accept a fait accompli.Lonlay, 111‚Äì16; Duboc, 207; Huard, 164‚Äì70; Sarrat, 108‚Äì10  The forces  Liu Yongfu (1837‚Äì1917) Admiral Anatole-Am√©d√©e-Prosper Courbet (1827‚Äì85) S∆°n T√¢y lay a few kilometres to the south of the Red River. The town was protected by a kite-shaped pentagonal curtain wall just over eleven feet high, with three short sides facing roughly east and two long sides converging to a sharp point to the west of the town. The curtain wall was enclosed on all five sides by a wide, deep moat filled with water and by a tall bamboo palisade. Even if an attacker crossed these obstacles and breached the curtain wall, he still had to capture the central citadel of S∆°n T√¢y. The citadel, built by Vietnamese engineers on the model of the French citadels of Cochinchina, lay at the heart of the town. It was square-shaped, and its walls were 300 metres long. It was dominated by a watchtower 18 metres high. According to the reports that the French had received, there were at least a hundred cannon in battery behind the defences.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 172‚Äì4; Histoire militaire, 69 To remain in contact with the flotilla, the French were bound to approach S∆°n T√¢y from the east, with their right flank lying on the Red River. In theory, they could march past S∆°n T√¢y on its northern side, squeezing their columns between the town and the river, and deploy for an attack on the vulnerable acute angle where the two long walls met to the west of the town. However, the defenders had done their best to ensure that they would never get there. The dyke paths leading to S∆°n T√¢y from the Day River converged at the village of Phu Sa, just to the northeast of the town. The Black Flags had hired European engineers to convert Phu Sa into an impregnable strongpoint. Water-filled ditches, bamboo palisades and trenches surrounded a central redoubt, and subsidiary defences hampered the approach to the main position. From the Phu Sa strongpoint, the Black Flags had an excellent field of fire both out to the east, from where the initial French attack was likely to come, and north to the Red River. To deploy to the north and west of S∆°n T√¢y, the French would first have to capture Phu Sa. This would not be an easy task, as Liu Yongfu had strongly garrisoned the village and packed it with cannon. The cannon were dug in beneath casemates, making them a difficult target to knock out.Thomazi, Conqu√™te, 172‚Äì4; Histoire militaire, 69 S∆°n T√¢y was defended by 3,000 veteran soldiers of the Black Flag Army under the command of Liu Yongfu, around 7,000 Vietnamese troops of indifferent quality under the command of Prince Ho√†ng K·∫ø Vi√™m, and a contingent of 1,000 Chinese troops under the command of Tang Zhiong (ÂîêÁÇØ). Ho√†ng K·∫ø Vi√™m's Vietnamese garrisoned the citadel, and the Chinese were deployed inside Sontay. The curtain wall and the outwork of Phu Sa were held by Liu Yongfu's Black Flags. Neither the Vietnamese nor the Chinese contingents would play any significant role in the battle, which was essentially a straight fight between the French and the Black Flags. Admiral Am√©d√©e Courbet led the bulk of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps to S∆°n T√¢y. The French deployed around 9,000 men for the campaign, organised into two columns under the respective command of Colonel Belin and Colonel Bichot.Thomazi, Histoire militaire, 69 Belin's column, 3,300 men strong, consisted of two Turco battalions (chefs de bataillon Jouneau and Letellier), one marine infantry battalion (chef de bataillon Roux) with an attached company of Cochinchinese riflemen, the 1st Foreign Legion Battalion (Lieutenant-Colonel Donnier), 800 Tonkinese riflemen (chef de bataillon Bertaux-Levillain) and three marine artillery batteries.Jouneau's Turco battalion was the 1st Battalion, 3rd Algerian Rifle Regiment (Captains Godinet, Noirot, Carles and Massip). Letellier's Turco battalion was the 2nd Battalion, 1st Algerian Rifle Regiment (Captains Servant, Cannebotin, Omar ben Chaouch and Ligrisse). Roux's marine infantry battalion consisted of the 25th, 26th and 30th Companies, 4th Marine Infantry Regiment (Captains Drouin, B√©court and Martelli√®re) and the 4th Annamese Rifle Company (Captain Serre de Bazaugour). Donnier's Legion battalion was the 1st Battalion, 1st Foreign Legion Regiment (Captains Conte, Moulinay, Bergounioux and Broussier). The column's artillery included the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Marine Artillery Batteries bis (Captains R√©gis, Dupont and Roussel). Bichot's column consisted of three marine infantry battalions (chefs de bataillon Chevallier, Dulieu and Reygasse), each with an attached company of Cochinchinese riflemen, a battalion of fusiliers-marins (capitaine de fr√©gate Laguerre), three marine artillery batteries and a 65-millimetre naval battery.Chevallier's battalion consisted of the 25th, 28th and 29th Companies, 1st Marine Infantry Regiment (Captains Poulnot, Boulle and Durruthy) and the 1st Annamese Rifle Company (Captain de Beauquesne). Dulieu's battalion consisted of the 21st, 22nd and 23rd Companies, 2nd Marine Infantry Regiment (Captains Bauche, Cuny and Leverger) and the 2nd Annamese Rifle Company (Captain Doucet). Reygasse's battalion consisted of the 26th, 29th and 33rd Companies, 3rd Marine Infantry Regiment (Captains Poisot, Noble and Trilha) and the 3rd Annamese Rifle Company (Captain Berger). The column's artillery included the 4th, 5th and 6th Marine Artillery Batteries bis (Captains Roperh, P√©ricaud and Dudraille) and lieutenant de vaisseau Amelot's naval battery.  The campaign  Both French columns set off from Hanoi at dawn on 11 December 1883. Courbet had told nobody the objective of the expedition, and many of the combatants had been expecting to march against B·∫Øc Ninh, which had been occupied by around 20,000 troops of China's Guangxi Army in the autumn of 1882. Belin's column marched overland to the Day River from Hanoi, while Bichot's column was transported up the Red River by six French gunboats of the Tonkin Flotilla (Pluvier, Trombe, √âclair, Hache, Mousqueton and Yatagan) and several steam launches, junks and tugs. On the afternoon of 11 December Bichot's column went ashore on the western bank of the Day River and secured a passage for Belin's slower-moving column. Meanwhile, Belin's column marched over Paper Bridge and through the villages of Ph·ªß Ho√†i, Kien Mai and Phong, recrossing the battlefields of 19 May and 15 August, and reached the Day River without incident. On 13 December both columns met five kilometres from the forward defences of S∆°n T√¢y. Belin's men needed rest, and Courbet postponed the battle for S∆°n T√¢y to the following day.Thomazi, Histoire militaire, 69  The battle for S∆°n T√¢y  The capture of S∆°n T√¢y, 16 December 1883 The battle to take S∆°n T√¢y was the fiercest engagement the French had yet fought against the Black Flags. The Black Flags fought ferociously to defend the city. Early in the afternoon of 14 December the French advanced from the east on the Phu Sa positions, beating off a Black Flag sortie against their right flank. Artillery was brought up, and in a two- hour bombardment the Black Flag guns at Phu Sa were gradually silenced. Later in the afternoon Roux and Chevallier's battalions captured the forward Black Flag positions at Phu Sa, but attempts to exploit this success failed. Godinet's company of Jouneau's Turco battalion and Cuny's company of Roux's marine infantry battalion assaulted the central redoubt, but were thrown back with heavy casualties. By nightfall the French were still stalled in front of Phu Sa. French casualties on 14 December were 68 killed (including 3 officers) and 249 wounded (including 17 officers). Nearly half these casualties were sustained by Jouneau's Turco battalion, which was unable to play any further role in the battle. In one day Courbet had lost more men than his predecessors Rivi√®re and Bou√´t had done in all their battles put together. Hoping to exploit Courbet's defeat, Liu Yongfu attacked the French lines the same night, but the Black Flag attack also failed disastrously. Liu Yongfu lost so many men in this counterattack that he was obliged to abandon the Phu Sa positions and withdraw into the fortified perimeter of S∆°n T√¢y. After resting his troops on 15 December, Courbet assaulted the defences of S∆°n T√¢y from the northwest on the afternoon of 16 December. This time the attack was thoroughly prepared by artillery, and delivered only after the defenders had been worn down. To hearten his troops, Courbet set an example of the utmost personal courage, riding forward to a position well within range of the Black Flag fire. At 5 p.m. Donnier's Foreign Legion battalion and Laguerre's fusiliers-marins captured the western gate of S∆°n T√¢y and fought their way into the town. Liu Yongfu's garrison withdrew to the citadel, and evacuated S∆°n T√¢y under cover of darkness several hours later. On the morning of 17 December the French stitched together an enormous tricolour flag from strips of cloth torn from captured Black Flag banners and hoisted it over the citadel of S∆°n T√¢y while Courbet made a triumphal entry on horseback.Bastard, 211‚Äì28; Cahu, 40‚Äì64; Challan de Belval, 139‚Äì41; Lonlay, 133‚Äì80; Grisot and Coulombon, 417‚Äì28; Huard, 180‚Äì7 and 202‚Äì31; Nicolas, 300‚Äì19; Sarrat, 110‚Äì17  Order of the day  On 17 December 1883 Courbet issued the following order of the day to the soldiers and sailors of the expeditionary corps: > Les forts de Phu-Xa et la citadelle de Son-Tay dont d√©sormais illustr√©s par > votre vaillance. Vous avez combattu, vous avez vaincu un ennemi redoutable. > Vous avez montr√© une fois de plus au monde entier que la France peut > toujours compter sur ses enfants. Soyez fiers de vos succ√®s. Ils assurent la > pacification du Tonkin.Thomazi, Histoire militaire, 72 > (The forts of Phu Sa and the citadel of S∆°n T√¢y will henceforth be famed for > your valour. You have fought and conquered a formidable enemy. You have once > again shown the whole world that France can always count upon her children. > Be proud of your successes. They have ensured the pacification of Tonkin.)  Significance  Courbet had achieved his objective, but at considerable cost. Total French casualties during the two days of fighting amounted to 83 dead and 320 wounded. The dead or mortally wounded officers included Captain Godinet of Jouneau's Algerian Rifle battalion, Captains Doucet and Cuny and Lieutenant Clavet of the marine infantry, and Captain Mehl of Donnier's Legion battalion. Twenty-two other officers were wounded.Thomazi, Histoire militaire, 71 One jaundiced French officer commented, 'Admiral Courbet took S∆°n T√¢y as you would expect a sailor to do: by boarding.'Huguet, page number to be supplied According to reports later received by the French, Chinese and Vietnamese casualties at S∆°n T√¢y had been heavy: 900 dead and around 1,000 wounded. Nearly all these casualties were suffered by Liu Yongfu's Black Flag Army.Thomazi, Histoire militaire, 71 The fighting at S∆°n T√¢y took a terrible toll of the Black Flags, and in the opinion of the British observer William Mesny broke them once and for all as a serious fighting force. The disproportionate sacrifices made by the Black Flag Army at S∆°n T√¢y had important consequences. Liu Yongfu felt that he had been deliberately left to bear the brunt of the fighting by his Chinese and Vietnamese allies, and determined never again to expose his troops so openly. After the fall of S∆°n T√¢y, Liu retreated with the Black Flag Army to B·∫Øc Ninh, but made little attempt to coordinate the movements of the Black Flag Army with those of the Chinese forces at B·∫Øc Ninh. The absence of the Black Flags from the battlefield was an important factor in the defeat of China's Guangxi Army in the B·∫Øc Ninh campaign in March 1884.

Michele himself was a wool carder.S. K. Cohn, Popular Protest in Late Medieval Europe (Manchester, 2004), p. 240 Role in the Ciompi Revolt There was much discontent in Florence in 1378. Salvestro de' Medici was challenging the authority of the Guelf Party and facing heavy resistance from the nobility. Moreover, many workers in Florence remained without a guild to represent them and were therefore entirely disenfranchised.S. K. Cohn, Popular Protest in Late Medieval Europe (Manchester, 2004), pp. 201‚Äì3 On 22 July 1378, violence broke out in Florence once again. Michele di Lando went to the Piazza of the Signoria where he was given a banner of justice with which to lead the people. He ordered that the Palace of the Signoria should be taken and the governors chose to flee.S. K. Cohn, Popular Protest in Late Medieval Europe (Manchester, 2004), pp. 240‚Äì1 Michele took power and for six weeks, he fought to restore stability.G. A. Brucker, Renaissance Florence (London, 1969), p. 47 His government had three new guilds created so that almost all men gained representation.S. K. Cohn, Popular Protest in Late Medieval Europe (Manchester, 2004), pp. 202‚Äì3 However the radicals were not happy with the new government for many of the old structures of government remained so they selected the Eight of Santa Maria Novella to represent them instead. This led to a conflict between the Priors led by Michele and the Eight. Michele was able to defeat the radicals and so returned to power. As a result of the revolt, he had the guild representing the lowest workers and the apprentices disbanded but left the others intact.S. K.

While the foundation works collaboratively with the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department, it is an independent organization, with its own board and priorities. Its mission is \\"to raise funds to enhance and preserve the experience of using the more than 260 Oregon State Parks, now and for generations to come.\\" History The foundation was established as the Oregon State Parks Trust on May 16, 1995. Founding trustees included Lucille S. \\"Lu\\" Beck, Brian G. Booth, Cynthia J. Ford, Lynn W. Newbry, and Nancy N. Russell. According to its initial articles of incorporation, Oregon State Parks Trust's principal purpose was \\"to acquire, obtain, and maintain funds or property for donation to the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department for public park or public recreation purposes.\\" Oregon State Parks Trust was registered as a charitable organization with the Oregon Department of Justice on June 19, 1995. The organization held its first official meeting on August 23, 1995. The Oregon State Parks have not been funded by the State General Fund (Taxes) since 1998. In 1998, the voters approved measure 66, which allocated 15% of the State Lottery proceeds to Parks & Natural Resources. Lottery funds allocated to Parks and Natural Resources are administered through the Parks and Natural Resources Fund and divided equally between Parks (7.5%) and watershed enhancement/salmon restoration (7.5%). The Parks portion is further split with 6.6% going to State Parks and .9% going to county and local parks. Immediately after passage, Governor Kitzhaber removed the General Fund from the Parks Department Budget. The Legislature has not been able/willing to replace those funds since. As a result, not a single penny of state taxes have gone to the state parks since 1998. In the early years of Lottery funding (2006-2015), the State Parks department was assigned the money-losing Oregon State Fair‚Ä¶this diverted $60 million of the lottery contribution from the other State Parks to retire debt and run the fair. The Lottery Funds, while important and significant to the State Parks, cover about 40% of the State Parks department budget and do not change in relation to the costs of running the State Parks. The amount of money from the Lottery for parks is fixed by law at 7.5% of the Lottery proceeds, which are subject to different fluctuations than the expenses of the State Parks. 12% of the funds must go to County Parks, leaving 6.6% available for the State Parks.https://www.oregonstateparksfoundation.org/our-work/why-is-the- foundation-needed/ See also *List of Oregon state parks References External links *Oregon State Parks Foundation (official website) Category:Environmental organizations based in Oregon Category:1995 establishments in Oregon ","title":"Oregon State Parks Foundation"},{"id":"18124069","text":"Nation Ford High School (NFHS) is a public high school in Fort Mill, South Carolina, United States.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed June 3, 2011 waterway in southwest Tennessee. It starts in extreme southeastern Shelby County, Tennessee, near the town of Collierville. From there, it flows westward, forming the southern border of Germantown. The creek continues to flow west through Memphis and through Whitehaven. Nonconnah Creek empties into McKellar Lake, an oxbow of the Mississippi River. There are three major expressways that follow most of its route. These are Interstate 55, Interstate 240, and Tennessee State Route 385, formerly named and still locally referred to as \\"Nonconnah Parkway\\".  History  Nonconnah Creek was created from glacial runoff around 12,000 years ago. Prior to around year 400, the creek flowed from its headwaters west- northwesterly until the location of the present-day I-240/TN 385 interchange. From there it continued across what is now East Memphis and Midtown and connected with the Wolf River just before it empties into the Mississippi River. Around AD 400, a massive seismic event in the Ellendale Fault (part of the New Madrid Fault system) raised a low ridge across present-day east Memphis, diverting Nonconnah Creek away from the Wolf, causing it to flow directly into the Mississippi River several miles south of the Wolf's mouth. The lowermost section of the Nonconnah that continued to flow into the Wolf eventually became known as Cypress Creek. Nonconnah Creek was widened and channelized in the 20th century (like many of the rivers in West Tennessee) from its mouth to near Houston Levee Road in Collierville. Name Nonconnah is a name derived from the Choctaw language or Chickasaw language purported to mean \\"seer, prophet\\".  Drainage basin  The Nonconnah Creek watershed covers parts of two counties in Tennessee (Shelby and Fayette) and two counties in Mississippi (Marshall and Desoto). The creek drains approximately half of the city of Memphis, the rest being drained by the Wolf River.  Major flooding  Major floods occurred in the basin on 21 November 1934, when 10.48 inches of rain fell in 24 hours, and on 9 May 1958, when 4.76 inches of rain fell in approximately eight hours. The most recent significant flood occurred on 3 December 1978, when 4.9 inches were recorded at the Memphis International Airport. The 1978 storm appears to be between the 5-year and 10-year frequency events. Under present day conditions, the 1934 and 1958 flood levels would cause considerably higher damages due to increased urbanization.Geology: Nonconnah Greenbelt Dedication Ceremony  Backwater flooding  If the Mississippi River gets above 40 feet on the Memphis river gauge, the Nonconnah, along with other local streams and rivers connected to the Mississippi, will begin to experience backwater flooding, which is when these streams begin to flow backwards as the Mississippi river rises and fills them. Backwater flooding occurred in both the 1927 and 1937 floods along the Mississippi River. In the 1940s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built an earthen levee system with pumping stations along the northern side of Nonconnah Creek from its mouth to Prospect Street in South Memphis. During the 2011 Mississippi River floods, these levees kept water off of the northern side. However, backwater flooding occurred on the south side causing damage to several subdivisions. The creek also flowed backwards within its channel to the Lamar Avenue (U.S. Route 78) overpass.  Greenbelt  The Nonconnah Greenbelt, a proposed system of trails, is currently being planned and constructed. If completed, it would stretch from Collierville to the Mississippi River. Phase I was completed in late 2007. It is located near Collierville near the intersection of TN 385 and Forest Hill Irene Road.Geology: Nonconnah Greenbelt Dedication Ceremony  See also  * Mississippi River Flood Map of 1927 * 2011 Mississippi River floods *List of rivers of Tennessee  External links  * National Weather Service, Hydrologic Prediction Service, Mississippi River * U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Mississippi River At Memphis, TN (Weather Bureau Gage)Gage Zero: 183.91 Ft, Record High Stage:48.7 Ft. = 232.61' Memphis River Gage Record High in Feet Above Sea Level * Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA issued Flood Maps * Photo 35, Year 1927, Looking West from U.S. 61 bridge along the sandbagged levee and Photo 39 February 9, 1937.

other married name of Mary Seymour, Lady Beauchamp and her maiden name Mary Capell, was an English noblewoman, gardener and botanist.Molly McClain, Beaufort: The Duke and His Duchess (Yale University Press, 2001)  Early life  Cornelius Johnson c.1640, at the National Portrait Gallery, London. Mary was born in Hadham Parva, Hertfordshire, sometime before 16 December 1630, on which date she was baptised. She was the daughter of Sir Arthur Capell, 1st Baron Capell of Hadham and Elizabeth Morrison. Life Sir Peter Lely, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art On 28 June 1648, Mary married her first husband Henry Seymour, Lord Beauchamp, and they had one son and one daughter. Her husband was a Royalist, imprisoned during the English Civil War. Her second husband, whom she married on 17 August 1657 was Henry Somerset, who became 1st Duke of Beaufort, by whom she had six children. During the Popish Plot, she was required in her husband's absence to call out the militia, to deal with a false alarm of a French invasion at the Isle of Purbeck, and did so \\"in a state of deadly fear\\". The supposed invasion, like much that happened (or failed to happen) during the Plot, was simply the result of public hysteria.Kenyon, J.P. The Popish Plot Phoenix Press reissue 2000 p.123 Despite this moment of panic, in general she maintained a detached and rational attitude to the Plot, expressing her amazement that the informer William Bedloe, whom she knew to be \\"a villain whose word would not have been taken at sixpence\\", should now have \\"power to ruin any man\\".Kenyon pp.109‚Äì110 She attended the trial of the Catholic barrister Richard Langhorne, presumably in case Bedloe, a bitter enemy of her husband, made any charges against him, and took notes of the evidence. When Bedloe protested at her presence, the Lord Chief Justice, William Scroggs, pointed out that the trial was open to the public, and asked irritably what a woman's notes amounted to anyway: \\"no more than her tongue, truly\\".Kenyon p.189 She was a notoriously exacting employer \\"striking terror in the hearts of her servants\\":Fraser, Antonia King Charles II Mandarin edition 1993 p.331 every day she would do a tour of the house and grounds, and any servant not found hard at work was instantly dismissed.Fraser p.331 Even neighbouring landowners held her in awe, and were anxious not to cross her. =Botanist and gardener= The Duchess of Beaufort was one of Britain's earliest distinguished lady gardeners, Alice Coats observes.Coats, Garden Shrubs and Their Histories (1964) 1992:212 (brief notice of her gardening abilities). She began seriously to collect plants in the 1690s,Douglas Chambers, \\"'Storys of Plants': The assembling of Mary Capel Somerset's botanical collection at Badminton\\" Journal of the History of Collections, 1997 and her interest in gardening intensified in her widowhood.Alice Coats remarks that \\"she would probably have been greatly annoyed had she known that Aiton was to date the year of her introductions from the date of her husband's death, not of her own.\\" (Coats (1964) 1992:212); Aiton's work was Hortus Kewensis. She had the assistance of such well-known gardeners and botanists as George London and Leonard Plukenet; seeds came to her from the West Indies, South Africa, India, Sri Lanka, China and Japan.Chambers 1997. In 1702, she engaged the services of William Sherard as tutor for her grandson, \\"hee loving my diversion so well. Sherard helped introduce more than 1500 plants, most of them greenhouse subjects, to her collection, at Badminton House or at Beaufort House, Chelsea. Sir Robert Southwell, Sir Hans Sloane and Jacob Bobart are all known to have sought her assistance in growing and identifying plants from unidentified seeds, some of which had come to them through the Royal Society of London.Julie Davies, \\"Botanizing at Badminton House: The Botanical Pursuits of Mary Somerset, First Duchess of Beaufort\\" in Domesticity in the Makingof Modern Science, ed. Donald L. Opitz, Staffan Bergwik, Brigitte Van Tiggelen (Palgrave Macmillan, 2016) p.33.

Hodder & Stoughton) Cover art by Val Biro This Rough Magic is a romantic suspense novel by Mary Stewart, first published in 1964. The title is a quote from William Shakespeare's The Tempest. Like several other novels by Stewart, it is set in Greece and has an element of suspense. Plot summary Lucy Waring, a young actress, is on holiday in Corfu with her sister Phyl, who is married to a rich Italian. Lucy meets photographer Godfrey Manning, the famous actor Sir Julian Gale, his aloof son Max, and Phyl's housekeeper Maria, whose husband is imprisoned in Albania. She also befriends a dolphin tame enough to approach humans. The peaceful scene is shattered when Maria's teenage son is reported drowned after falling overboard while out at night sailing in Godfrey's boat. When Lucy stumbles on a second dead man, she realizes something is terribly wrong on the idyllic island. The book's major theme is Shakespeare's play The Tempest, which Sir Julian believes was set on Corfu. Julian Gale and the play Tiger, Tiger (with a different author) are also mentioned in The Wind Off the Small Isles (1968) by the same author.

By its nature, the Agora Center is interdisciplinary and networked. Its purpose is to conduct, coordinate, and administrate top-level research and development that relates to the knowledge society and which places emphasis on the human perspective. The research and development is conducted in the form of fixed-period projects in cooperation with the University of Jyv√§skyl√§‚Äôs other faculties and separate institutes, businesses, the public sector and other relevant parties. The Agora Center also promotes researcher training through its various research projects. One of the core missions of the Agora Center is to effectively combine research and development with education. The project staff includes a high number of students and post-graduate students. The Research in the Agora Center is mainly based on Human Technology. Human Technology refers to the human-centred approach to technological systems and methods that takes into account human needs and requirements as well as its implications for humans. The Agora Center‚Äôs administration model follows the requirements of being a separate institute of the University of Jyv√§skyl√§ and the needs for networking. The directors of the Agora Center are professors from different departments who work in this position in addition to their departmental commitments and activities. The Agora Center has an interdisciplinary Managing Board, on which all of the faculties of the University of Jyv√§skyl√§ are represented. The Agora Center also has an international Advisory Board. Agora in winter Agora in summer History In order to enable growth of Human Tech research, the facilities of the Agora Human Technology Center were built in 2000. The University simultaneously created the Faculty of Information Technology, combining the Department of Computer Science and Information Systems, the Department of Mathematical Information Technology and the Information Technology Research Institute. The faculty plays the main role in technological research within the Agora concept. The other essential side of the Agora concept is constituted by the human and social sciences. From the beginning it was evident that to study human technology, an interdisciplinary approach was needed. The networked activity started in the form of the Psykocenter in 2000. In the initial period of the Center‚Äôs history, the network was associated with the Centre of Excellence in Psychology in order to coordinate the human-centred research related to the knowledge society. However, it soon became clear that for the intended interdisciplinary research to function, the research operations needed an independent entity with its own, in other words autonomous, administration. Thus, in 2002, the University of Jyv√§skyl√§ established the Agora Center as a separate institute that also included the Psykocenter. The Agora Center‚Äôs first operating period was from 1.2.2002 to 31.7.2005. Nonetheless, in April 2004, the lifespan of Agora Center was extended to the year 2009. In order to support the functioning and networking of the Agora Center‚Äôs interdisciplinary research environments, the Agora Center takes various forms of action. For example, it promotes researcher training and university education, supports researchers in managing interdisciplinary projects, holds open events and forums for multiple disciplines and sectors of society, surveys and promotes the wellbeing of its personnel and conducts Public Relations exercises. Laboratories The research and development activities in the Agora Center are carried out in interdisciplinary environments called laboratories. Each of them concentrates on a specific research area. The laboratories offer the environment for versatile research projects. =Mind Tech Laboratory= The Agora Mind Tech Laboratory develops and applies technology for the study of the human mind. Its objectives and strengths are to be found in the way it combines scientific and technological expertise in the fields of psychophysiological measurement and mathematical information technologies. The three major themes of the laboratory are learning, the evaluation of skills, and the neurological basis of perception. Central applications for this research are the treatment of dyslexia and the intensive training of language skills. The laboratory utilizes fields such as psychology, information technology, statistics, and cognitive neuroscience. All research projects involve several international researchers and extensive cooperative networks. =Learning Laboratory= The Agora Learning Laboratory‚Äôs (ALL) multidisciplinary research center explores the use of virtual learning environments, knowledge in designing powerful new learning environments, pedagogical innovations, evaluation methods for e-learning purposes, and knowledge management. ALL works collaboratively with the Institute for Educational Research. The contexts of the ALL research projects transcend curricula areas, levels of education, and work organizations, with the primary aim of developing e-learning models. Collaboration between the basic research conducted at the University of Jyv√§skyl√§ and its practical application in educational and business organizations is highly valued. This integration of high-level scientific knowledge, pedagogical expertise, and product development know-how facilitates the rapid transfer of knowledge into meeting the needs of societies. =Game Laboratory= The multidisciplinary Agora Game Laboratory (AGL) focuses on the design, development, and research of digital games. The AGL offers an open forum for students, researchers, and others who are interested in games and gaming. Its multidisciplinary expertise covers such areas as educational sciences, computer science, mathematical information technology, and psychology. The research unit designs and studies both serious and entertainment games. Its strengths lie in the game-like learning environments and user-centred game design in which future users (e.g. children, young people, adults, elderly) actively participate in the design process. The laboratory also serves as a network for other actors in the field, and thus forms a link between the University, other game research networks, and businesses. =Industrial IT ‚Äì tutkimus= The Agora Industrial IT Group organizes innovative interdisciplinary research and development in the area of information and communication technologies. It aims to advance the technological know-how of networked global industries. As the focus of global markets move more from products to services, businesses and industries require new, human-centred solutions based in information technology. The goal is to develop innovations that arise from international research cooperation, and to transfer new technology into the business world. The strengths of the group are scientific computation and optimisation, and, by extension, solutions to support production and logistics in businesses‚Äô product design. In addition to the technological applications, the projects emphasize developing the human resources and business competitiveness and attend to the role of the person as the user of technology. The group collaborates closely with public sector organizations. =User Psychology Laboratory= The Agora User Psychology Laboratory investigates the behavior of the user with technologies and services in various types of interactive situations. The models of user behavior are significantly valuable in, for example, for device and software design, in education and training, and in industrial R&D; processes. Basic research, as well as usability analyses of companies‚Äô products and services, is conducted in the laboratory. Applications can be found in wide areas of human activity. Examples of research topics include mobile services, e-learning, agent technologies, ubiquitous computing, vehicle‚Äìdriver interaction, surgery simulation, emotional computing and mobile social networks. At the core of the research in the laboratory is a holistic view of the user. Subsequently, the research must be multidisciplinary. The laboratory‚Äôs researchers come from the fields of cognitive science, information systems, education, psychology, and art research. =Virtual Environment Center= The Agora Virtual Environment Center (AVEC) conducts research in the fields of computer graphics and virtual reality. It also offers visualisation and graphics programming services to various departments within the University of Jyv√§skyl√§ and to companies. AVEC also arranges seminars and lecture courses. The foci of AVEC are virtual reality applications, interactions in virtual environments, and programming architectures for virtual reality applications. When selecting and implementing research topics, AVEC‚Äôs management emphasizes issues that have technical, financial, and/or scientific significance. The topics also develop the use of virtual reality visualisation in both research and industry. Virtual reality visualisation can be used to improve understanding of complex structures and phenomena. For example, a virtual prototype can reduce the amount of time an industry invests in the product development cycle, and a simulated model of a product can be built and tested in a virtual environment. Virtual reality simulations can significantly improve a product‚Äôs quality and functionality. =Innoroad Laboratory= The Agora Innoroad Laboratory serves as a forum for international cooperation and regional collaboration in multidisciplinary research on road traffic and other driver and transportation-related issues. The Lab‚Äôs key strengths include the modeling, optimisation, and application of ICT tools in traffic and transportation, as well as research in predicting human error. Among the projects ongoing in the lab is research funded by the Research Council of Norway on optimising newspaper delivery and waste collection, and the development of new optimization tools for communal logistic applications, funded by the KAKS foundation. A driving simulator is used to study people‚Äôs driving skills and what they do under various circumstances. This device also provides training and evaluation for professionals for whom driving is an essential element, such as the drivers of emergency vehicles. The simulator also provides opportunities to evaluate the driving skills of, for instance, old and young drivers, and to develop innovations and new products that enhance driving, traffic, and transportation systems. =Service Sciences Laboratory= Services science is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to bring together knowledge from diverse areas to improve the service operations, performance, and innovation within industry and the public sector. In essence, it represents a melding of technology with an understanding of human behaviour and thinking, as well as business processes and organization. With methods such as scientific computing, overall IT-expertise and knowledge on human behaviour, the Agora Service Sciences Laboratory aims at creating new service solutions that can range, for instance, from new applications, better understanding of the research subject or new improved operations models to enhanced logistical structures. Much of the research done in the Service Sciences Laboratory has been related to promoting health care and wellbeing of people through an interdisciplinary and multipartner approach. The experts at the Agora Center have collaborated tightly across disciplines with each other, the end-users and other partners to create new innovative solutions to enhance the operations of social and health care services. For example, in the conducted NOVA-project the operations of an emergency duty clinic of Central Finland Health Care District have been enhanced through ICT-based simulations targeting the basic and special health care processes and structure, health care economics and quality of the activities. The successfully met aim was to speed up the patient‚Äôs treatment process from the diagnosing phase to the ward. Online Journal Human Technology The international journal Human Technology: An Interdisciplinary Journal on Humans in ICT Environmentshumantechnology.jyu.fi is an open-access, on-line, scholarly journal that explores current topics regarding the interaction between people and technology. Innovative, peer-reviewed articles in Human Technology address the issues and challenges surrounding the role of humans in all areas of our ICT-infused societies.

It was released June 24, 2008. It is written by Queenie Chan and Koontz, with illustrations by Chan in a manga style. Plot summary In Odd We Trust serves as a prequel to the first Odd Thomas novel. The ghost of a young boy appears to Odd, and he embarks on a quest to bring justice to the boy's killer so that his ghost can move on. Odd's friend, the Chief of Police Wyatt Porter, shares some details of the case, and informs him that the boy's babysitter is the one that discovered the body. The babysitter turns out to be Sherry Sheldon, a childhood friend of Odd's girlfriend and soulmate, Stormy Llewellyn. Sherry relates that a stalker has been leaving her disturbing notes for several months, and believes this stalker may be the murderer. Odd and Stormy resolve to catch the stalker before he kills again. Odd asks the ghost of the little boy to help him find his killer, and Joey leads him to a street corner, where he sees a suspicious man. The man flees when Odd tries to address him. Odd gives chase, but loses his quarry when he trips over a lawn gnome. Four neighborhood children are believed to be targets, as they have each received a note from the killer. Chief Porter assigns police escorts to each of the houses, and Odd and Stormy decide to spend the night with Sherry at the house where she is babysitting a girl named Angelica. The policeman on stakeout at the house finds an empty car containing a mutilated mannequin, and from this Odd deduces that the killer is nearby, taunting them. He throws open the doors of a nearby van, and discovers the man he chased earlier. He and Odd trade veiled threats, but when Stormy shows up with a gun, the man drives off. Chief Porter traces the van's license plates to a man named Kyle Bernshaw, and gives Odd the resulting address. Odd and Stormy break into Bernshaw's house, to find giant piles of magazines (from which his mysterious notes have been cut and glued together), and a note to Odd, revealing that this was a trap. Odd turns to find himself cornered by a vicious dog, from which he is saved at the last minute by Joey's ghost. Odd and Stormy race back to the house where they left Sherry, only to find out that Angelica's parents have fired her and she has left. Odd realizes that Sherry, not one of the four children under police protection, was the target all along. The two borrow a car and, using Odd's psychic magnetism (an ability that draws him to a person if he concentrates on them while traveling), they locate Bernshaw in an abandoned slaughterhouse. Odd fights him, with limited success, until Stormy shoots him in the leg, and Odd is able to subdue him. They free Sherry from the trunk of Bernshaw's car. The killer is taken into custody, but refuses to confess, insisting that he will be given a chance to escape, as he has made a deal with the devil and everything he wants always comes to him. He threatens to reveal Odd's identity and abilities to the world, bringing a storm of media attention, one of the very things Odd fears most. Odd lies and pretends that he, too, has sold his soul to the devil for his powers, but just as he begins to make headway with taking Bernshaw into his confidence, a guard collapses and the killer is able to grab the guard's gun. He fires, but the bullet ricochets off a chair Odd is holding. The bullet kills Bernshaw. Angelica's parents re-hire Sherry, and the story ends with Odd and Stormy musing on the happy ending they have managed. Characters =Odd Thomas= Odd Thomas is the protagonist of the Odd Thomas series. He is a short-order cook at the Pico Mundo grill, who has the ability to see the lingering dead. He uses this ability to try and bring peace to the ghosts he encounters, so that they can move on to the next life. Traumatic childhood experiences left him extremely uncomfortable with guns, so he relies on his resourcefulness to escape the sometimes hostile situations in which he finds himself. =Stormy Llewellyn= Stormy Llewellyn is Odd's girlfriend and soulmate. She grew up in an orphanage, except for a six-month stint in which she was adopted by a family, only to be sexually abused. Stormy intends to marry Odd, but she is waiting until she overcomes her traumatic past. She does not share Odd's fear of guns, and carries a pistol with which she provides backup for Odd on his adventures. =Chief Wyatt Porter= Wyatt Porter is the Chief of Police in Pico Mundo, and serves as a father figure to Odd. He is one of the few people who are aware of Odd's abilities, and has sometimes been able to catch elusive criminals with Odd's paranormal help. =Terri Stambaugh= Terri is Odd's boss at the Pico Mundo Grill, and something of a mother figure to him. Odd does not own a car, and when circumstances force him to drive somewhere, Terri loans him her Mustang. =Sherry Sheldon= Sherry Sheldon is a new character introduced in the graphic novel. She is a childhood friend of Stormy's, who grew up with her at the orphanage. She babysits children, one of whom is the murdered boy, Joey. She is being stalked by a mysterious figure who leaves her constant notes.

In 1973, Mark Tenser, who had been vice-president, became president with Jacobs' ascension to become chairman of the board. Jacobs' daughter Marilyn Jacobs Tenser became vice president. In July 1988, Jacobs died in a motorcycle accident, which resulted in his son, Louis, taking the helm of Crown International.History of Crown International Pictures by Crown International Pictures. Filmography Crown International began releasing both low-budget films as Bloodlust! and The Seventh Commandment, by American producers, as well as foreign films such as First Spaceship on Venus and Varan the Unbelievable (released as a double feature in 1962) which Crown was able to acquire inexpensively, due to the US dollar's strength. Crown began producing its own films, starting with Coleman Francis' The Skydivers, in 1963. Beginning in 1961, Crown began by releasing six films, with the number rising to 12 a decade years later. Jacobs felt that Crown survived by having carefully planned growth and not overextending its product.p.13 A Salute to Red Jacobs Box Office Magazine 8 Feb 1971 He said that Crown did not want to be regarded as a mini major studio but as the top of the independents, to give the company more freedom in selecting and exploiting its film library.p.14 Ibid Well over 50% of exhibitors showing Crown's products were drive-in theatres, with the number decreasing to 30% in 1981.p.183 Segrave, Kerry Drive-In Theatres: A History from their Inception in 1933 1992 McFarland Notable Crown International movies include: * The Beast of Yucca Flats (1961) * Bloodlust!

Established in 1961 as Albury North High School, the school enrolled approximately 730 students in 2018, from Year 7 to Year 12, of whom 15 percent identified as Indigenous Australians and seven percent were from a language background other than English. The school is operated by the NSW Department of Education; the principal is Jennifer Parrett.  History  The establishment of the school resulted from a realisation (originally in 1954) that the town of Albury would need a second high school. It was established to serve the educational needs of the rapidly developing North Albury and Lavington area, and its original name was Albury North High School. It was first opened in 1961, receiving a student intake of 150 students in January (housed in the town's other high school) and moving into its own first new buildings in June of that year. There was a fire in B Block in 1973. In 1982 an Aboriginal Liaison Officer was appointed. This is believed to be the first such appointment in a NSW school. Visual Arts Head Teacher John Skillington designed the Centenary of Federation Medallion. The school has participated in 126 Rock Eisteddfod Challenges; participating in the Premier Division for the past 7 years. = Name change = The name of the school was changed in 1996 to James Fallon High School. Further, the motto became \\"excellence in diversity\\". James Fallon (1823‚Äì1886) was an Irish-born businessman (son of a farmer in Athlone, Ireland) who arrived in Sydney in 1841 and moved to Albury in 1854 to open a general store. He rose to great prominence in the town, and served (from 1859) as its first mayor. He also became a successful vineyard owner and wine merchant.  Facilities  The school currently has a hall, a dance hall, seven school teaching blocks, two large ovals and a multi-sports complex.

Wave picking is an application of short-interval-scheduling. Managers, using a WMS, may assign groups of orders into short intervals called \\"waves\\", to initially simulate the flow for the day, consistent with the order departure plan and available labor. When the plan is satisfactory, it is accepted. The WMS will then release the waves to the warehouse sequentially throughout the day, to allow managers to coordinate the several parallel and sequential activities required to complete the daily work plan.Dan Gilmore, \\"Warehouse Management: To Wave or not to Wave?\\", Supply Chain Digest, June 8, 2006. Accessed 12 June 2014 One of the objectives of wave picking is to minimize the variation of workload in each work function by wave.Oracle Warehouse Management User's Guide, v12.1. Accessed 12 June 2014 The wave planning data includes the workload (order lines, cases, each items, value added services, etc.) by order or function (case picking, repack picking, pallet movement, pick position replenishment, packing, etc.), providing management the information to calculate staff requirements (Reasonable Expectancies or Productivity Standards) to guide the assignment of staff by function, with the reasonable expectation that the work in each function, within each wave. Waves are often constructed (based on each day's order characteristics and available staffing) to last between 1 and 4 hours, with resulting 8 to 2 waves in a shift. There are three basic management tasks accomplished and benefits of wave picking. #To organize the sequence of orders and their assignment to wages, consistent with routing, loading and planned departure times of shipping vehicles or production requirements, etc., and therefore to reduce the staging space required for shipping dock handling to assemble orders, load and ship; #To assign staff to each wave and function within each wave, with the expectation that all the work assigned to each wave will be completed at approximately the same time, within the wave period, providing management with the ability to monitor and manage performance throughout the day, responding in a timely way to problems that occur, and more effectively utilize the staffing throughout the shift; and #To support management control, before and during a work shift, to achieve the daily plan and react in a timely way, and measure and report the results. Material handling methods and equipment are independent of waving. Each set of methods (e.g., order picking, batch picking, bulk picking) and equipment (e.g., conveyor and sorter, ASRS, order picker, pallet jack, forklift) will yield a different expected productivity rate for management to use in determining the number of staff-hours to assign to each function by wave. Additional benefits of wave picking include the improved ability to #measure productivity within a function; #estimate staff required; #estimate the throughout capacity based on staffing levels; #evaluate the impact of changes in methods and equipment by function; #provide feedback regarding performance; and #better understand the nature of the workload as it changes seasonally, as a consequence of demand, and as a consequence of sales efforts and marketing campaigns.

It had a population of 21 household;H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 114 who were all Muslims. They paid a fixed tax-rate of 33.3% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, olive trees, vineyards, fruit trees, goats and beehives, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 7,750 ak√ße. In 1838, ‚Äò‚ÄôKefr Malik‚Äô‚Äô was noted as a Muslim village in the District of Beni Salim, east of Jerusalem.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, Appendix 2, p. 125 In 1870, Victor Gu√©rin found Kafr Malik to have 350 inhabitants, some thirty Catholics and fifteen \\"schismatic Greek\\"; the others were Muslim. In the courtyard of the medhafeh, or guesthouse, he was shown several beautiful stone plaques and three sections of columns and several capitals of the Doric form belonging to an old edifice long since destroyed.Gu√©rin, 1874, pp. 208-209 An Ottoman village list of about 1870 counted a population of 416 Muslims in 77 houses, and 15 Christians in 6 houses. In total 432 persons in 83 houses, though the population count included men only.Socin, 1879, p. 156 also noted it was located in the Beni Salim DistrictHartmann, 1883, p. 115, also noted 83 houses In 1882, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Kefr Malik as: \\"a village of moderate size on high ground.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1882, SWP II, p. 292 In 1896 the population of Kefr Malik was estimated to be about 870 persons.Schick, 1896, p. 122 =British Mandate era= In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, the village, called Kufr Malek, had a population of 943, all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table VII, Sub- district of Ramallah, p. 17 increasing in the 1931 census to 972; 922 Muslims and 20 Christians, in 217 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 50 In the 1945 statistics the population was 1,100; 1,080 Muslims and 20 Christians,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics, 1945, p. 26 while the total land area was 52,196 dunams, according to an official land and population survey.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

It was annexed by Jordan in 1950. The Jordanian census of 1961 found 1,346 inhabitants in Kafr Malik.Government of Jordan, Department of Statistics, 1964, p. 24 It was further noted (note 2) that it was governed through a village council. =1967-present= Since the Six-Day War in 1967, Kafr Malik has been under Israeli occupation. After the 1995 accords, 12,7% of Kafr Malik‚Äôs land iwas classified as Area B, the remaining 87.3% as Area C. Israel has confiscated land from Kafr Malik for the Israeli settlements of Kokhav HaShahar and Mitzpe Kramim.

In 2010 the leading causes of death among men aged 15 to 64 were alcohol related deaths, ischaemic heart disease, accident, suicides, lung cancer and cerbrovascular diseases. Among women the leading causes were breast cancer, alcohol related deaths, accidents, suicides, ischaemic heart disease and lung cancer.  Health status  A new measure of expected human capital calculated for 195 countries from 1990 to 2016 and defined for each birth cohort as the expected years lived from age 20 to 64 years and adjusted for educational attainment, learning or education quality, and functional health status was published by the Lancet in September 2018. Finland had the highest level of expected human capital: 28¬∑4 health, education, and learning-adjusted expected years lived between age 20 and 64 years. = Alcohol consumption = The total annual alcohol consumption has risen from 7.6 litres (in 1985) to 10.0 litres of 100% alcohol equivalent per capita in 2010. There has been a small reduction in alcohol consumption in the recent years. Alcohol use is highest in the Northern Finland with 10.9 litres and lowest at the √Öland Islands with 5.7 litres per person. Although the consumption is average to other western countries, binge drinking with especially teenagers and becoming intoxicated has remained as a characteristic of Finnish drinking habits. Finland has a national alcohol programme to reduce the long-term effects of alcohol consumption. The World Health Organization has published a list of countries by alcohol consumption. = Smoking rates = The percentage of Finish adults who smoked in 2011. Smoking among adults has shown a marked decline over the past thirty years in most OECD countries. Much of this decline also in Finland can be attributed to policies aimed at reducing tobacco consumption through public awareness campaigns, advertising bans and increased taxation. Smoking in Finland has reduced, and now the smoking rates among adults in Finland in 2009 stood at 18.6%, lower than the OECD average of 22.3%. = Drug usage = Drug use is not a major public health problem in Finland. The most commonly used drug is cannabis. According to a study from 2008, the percentage of the population aged 15 to 69 who had at some point in their lives tried cannabis was 13%; 3% of the population had used cannabis within the previous 12 months. = Obesity = Overweight and obesity are common in Finland. Half of the adults are overweight, and every fifth adult is obese. The weight in men has increased since 1970‚Äôs, in women since 1980‚Äôs. Among the Nordic countries Finland ranks the highest in a percentage of adults who are overweight. In comparison to other European countries, Finland is slightly above the average but overweight is still more common in South Europe and Great Britain. Overweight among children and adolescents has also become widespread. The number of overweight 12- to 18-year-olds has nearly tripled in the past four decades. 10% of boys and 15% of girls in preschool were overweight in a follow-up from 2007 to 2009 =Communicable diseases= HIV/AIDS is not a major public health concern in Finland. The prevalence among adult population on 2009 was 0.1%. HIV/AIDS in Europe is much more common than in Finland, and the countries very near to Finland have much higher prevalence rates, due to increased travel HIV/AIDS rates in Finland may rise. It had the lowest rate of death from communicable diseases in Europe (9 per 100,000) in 2015. =Noncommunicable diseases= The most significant public health problems are currently circulatory diseases, cancer, musculoskeletal diseases and mental health problems. Emerging problems are obesity, chronic lung diseases and type 2 diabetes. 300 000 Finns are diagnosed with diabetes. Approximately 200 000 suffer from type 2 diabetes unknowingly and many more have prediabetes. The number of people with diabetes are estimated to double in 10 years. Most of the incidences could be prevented with healthy life styles, i.e. sufficient level of physical activity, obtaining normal weight and eating healthy. Major causes of deaths in Finland are cardiovascular diseases, malignant tumours, dementia and Alzheimer's disease, respiratory diseases, alcohol related diseases and accidental poisoning by alcohol. In 2010 the leading causes of death among men aged 15 to 64 were alcohol related deaths, ischaemic heart disease, accident, suicides, lung cancer and cerbrovascular diseases. Among women the leading causes were breast cancer, alcohol related deaths, accidents, suicides, ischaemic heart disease and lung cancer. Proportional mortality (% of total deaths, all ages, both sexes) =Mental health= Suicide mortality in Finland has generally been one of the highest in Europe, but it has reduced to 18 per 100 000 population in 2005\\\\. One reason for this may be the large national suicide prevention project which was carried out between 1986 and 1996. The World Health Organization has compiled a list of countries by suicide rate.

He was the founder of the Irish and the Rhenish Provinces of the Order. Life Fr Lavalin Nugent (he took the name Francis on entering the Capuchins) was born in Walshestown near Mullingar, Co. Westmeath. He was the son of Edward Nugent, of the Dysert family, and Margaret O'Connor, the daughter of the 'Great O'Connor Offaly'. At an early age he was sent to France to receive an education which the Penal Laws denied him at home. Before the age of twenty he obtained the degree of doctor at the Universities of Paris and Louvain; and he occupied chairs in these two centres of learning, prior to his entrance into religion. He acquired a knowledge of Greek and Hebrew, and could speak a number of European languages fluently. In 1589 he joined the Capuchin Flandro-Belgian Province, taking the name of Francis. In due course he was professed and ordained priest. Towards the close of 1594, or the beginning of 1595 he was sent to France where the French Capuchin provinces were being formed and established communities at Metz and Charleville. Meanwhile, he continued to deliver lectures in philosophy and theology at Paris. In 1596 he went as custos-general of France to the general chapter at Rome, and was appointed commissary general of the Capuchins at Venice. Three years later, being again in Rome he took part in a public disputation in theology at which Pope Clement VIII presided. Father Francis maintained his thesis with skill and eloquence, and was awarded the palm of victory. At the general chapter of 1599 he was relieved of the provincialate and returned to Belgium, where he remained about eleven years. In 1610, at the request of John Zwickhard, Archbishop of Mainz, seven friars of this province were sent to establish the order in the Rhine country, and Father Francis was appointed their commissary general. He founded a convent at Paderborn in 1612, and two years later communities were settled at Essen, M√ºnster, and Aachen. He also established the Confraternity of the Passion at Cologne; amongst its first protectors were two friends, Mgr Antonio Albergatti, the nuncio at Cologne, and Frederick of Hohenzollern, the dean of the cathedral. In 1615 he began a monastery at Mainz, and Pope Paul V nominated him vicar Apostolic and commissary general with full power to establish the Order in Ireland. Meanwhile, in 1618 the monastery of Charleville, in the Ardennes, became a training-school for friars intended for the Irish mission, and facilities for the same purpose were offered by the Flandro-Belgian Province. A fresh band of workers was soon sent to Ireland and Father Nugent was thus enabled to found the first monastery in Dublin in 1624. The Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Fleming, in 1629 addressed to the Irish clergy a letter commending the Capuchin Fathers specially mentioning \\"their learning, prudence, and earnestness\\". Two years later Father Nugent founded a monastery at Slane, in the diocese of his friend, Dr. Dease, who had previously borne public testimony to the merits of the Capuchins. Owing to failing health, he retired in 1631 to Charleville. He is generally credited with the foundation at Lille of an Irish College with his cousin Fr. Christopher Cusack (President-general of the Irish Colleges in the low countries) for the free education of poor youths from Ulster and Meath for the Irish clergy. He died at Charleville on the Feast of the Ascension, 1635. Giovanni Battista Rinuccini described him as \\"a man of most ardent zeal and most exemplary piety\\", and the annalists of the order state that he refused the Archbishopric of Armagh offered him by Pope Pius V, who styled him \\"the support of the Church and the light of the orthodox faith\\". Works He wrote several works, of which the principal are: *\\"Tractatus De Hibernia\\" *\\"Cursus philosophicus et theologicus\\" *\\"De Meditatione et Conscienti√¶ examine\\" *\\"Paradisus contemplantium\\" *\\"Super regula Minorum, Expositio Copiosa\\".

Statement The theorem states that the entire polynomial hierarchy PH is contained in PPP; this implies a closely related statement, that PH is contained in P#P. Definitions #P is the problem of exactly counting the number of solutions to a polynomially-verifiable question (that is, to a question in NP), while loosely speaking, PP is the problem of giving an answer that is correct more than half the time. The class P#P consists of all the problems that can be solved in polynomial time if you have access to instantaneous answers to any counting problem in #P (polynomial time relative to a #P oracle). Thus Toda's theorem implies that for any problem in the polynomial hierarchy there is a deterministic polynomial-time Turing reduction to a counting problem.1998 G√∂del Prize.

As the show begins, there is a spotlight on the floor and the voice of Georgia Holt, Cher's mother, is heard calling her young daughter: \\"Cher? Cher? Cher, is that you? I thought I asked you not to mess up my record albums.\\" Cher steps into the spotlight, made up to look like a younger version of herself with her hair in pigtails. The young Cher sits on the floor and tells her mother that she is upset because she is not blonde and she says that all the pretty girls have blonde hair and blue eyes. Her mother tells her daughter that she is beautiful and someday she will realize just how special she really is. Cher tells her mother that she will try to understand and explains that she got into the record albums so that she could learn the songs from West Side Story for school.

Career His works consist mostly of landscapes painted on location, of realistic historical naval scenes very precisely detailed and brushed by his ambidextrous hands, and of still-lives blended with eccentric imagery. His oeuvre is a reflection of his knowledge of the maritime world, his numerous travels, his interest in and taste for distinctly drawn landscapes, and a consequence of an overflowing imagination that made him a phenomenal story teller animated by nostalgia‚Äîat times even by a certain anguish. Born into a family of artists (he was the maternal grandson of two recognized painters Hortense Dury-Vasselon Grand Prix de Rome and Marius Vasselon, and the paternal grandson of Victor Le Baube, painter/sculptor), he began to draw at a very early age (his parents Marthe Vasselon and Robert Le Baube were themselves exceptional at drawing). The novels of Jules Verne (and the illustrations contained in the Hetzel book collection) left a profound mark on him in his childhood, and as a result they would be a longstanding source of inspiration. He studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts. Family Le Baube was the father of the photographer Guy le Baube and the uncle of the painter Guillaume Le Baube.

Life Entering the order at the age of twelve, he made his religious profession in 1612, and studied philosophy and theology in the convent of St. James at Paris. He obtained (1632) the doctorate in theology at the Sorbonne, and taught in various houses of the order. Besides Latin and Greek he was conversant with Italian, Spanish, and Hebrew. He was a member of the commission appointed to examine the works and teachings of the Jansenists and to prevent the further dissemination of their doctrine in the Sorbonne. In the disputes on grace between the Thomists and Molinists, which the teaching of Jansenius revived, he adhered strictly to the Thomistic doctrine. He was esteemed at the royal court and received a pension of 600 francs. He was buried in the chapel of the convent of St. James in Paris, and a marble stone beside the grave bears a long inscription recounting his virtues, his learning, and his services to his country. Works His numerous works fall into three classes: (a) new editions of older theologians which he supplied with commentaries and explanatory notes; (b) his own theological works; (c) his poetical and political writings. In the first class are *\\"Raineri de Pisis [1351] ord. Fr. Praed. Pantheologia sive universa theologia ordine alphabetico per varios titulos distributa\\" (Lyons, 1670): to each of the three volumes of this work he added a dissertation against the Jansenists; *\\"S. Thomae Aq. Expositio continua super quatuor evangelistas\\" (Lyons, 1670); *\\"S. Thomae Aq. commentaria in quatuor libros sententiarum P. Lombardi\\" (Lyons, 1659); *\\"Commentarius posterior super libros sententiarum\\" (Lyons, 1660); *\\"S. Thomae Aq. quaestiones quodlibetales\\" (Lyons, 1660); *\\"S. Thomae Aq. Summa theologica innumeris Patrum, Conciliorum, scripturarum ac decretorum testimoniis ad materias controversas vel ad moralem disciplinam pertinentibus. . . illustrata\\" (Lyons, 1663); *\\"S. Thomae Aq. explanatio in omnes d. Pauli Ap. epistolas commentaria\\" (Lyons, 1689). His important theological works are: *\\"Judicium seu censorium suffragium de propositione Ant. Arnaldi sorbonici doctoris et socii ad quaestionem juris pertinente\\" (Paris, 1656); *\\"Theses theologicae de gratia seu theses molinisticae thomisticis notis expunctae\\" (Paris, 1656); *\\"Apologia naturae et gratiae\\" (Bordeaux, 1665). Against Launoy, the champion of the \\"Gallican Liberties\\", he wrote: *\\"De jejunii christiani et christianiae abstinentiae vero ac legitimo ritu\\" (Paris, 1667); *\\"De Concilio plenario, quod contra Donatistas baptismi quaestionem ex Augustini sensu definivit\\" (Paris, 1667); *\\"De plenarii Concilii et baptismatis hereticorum assertione dissertatio posterior anteriorem firmans\\" (Paris, 1668); *\\"De baptismi antiquo usu ab Ecclesia instituto, dissertatio\\" (Paris, 1668); *\\"De Constantini baptismo, ubi, quando et a quibus fuerit celebratus historica dissertatio\\" (Paris, 1680). The purpose of his poetical and political writings seems to have been to extol the dignity and glory of France and her kings. He delivered in Rome in 1628 a panegyric in honour of the victory of Louis XIII at La Rochelle and in 1661 composed a poem in honour of the son of Louis XIV.

Batsford, London, 1979, p. 433. but if it means \\"Rock\\", it may refer to Down Hill situated to the east of it. It was the fifth fort on Hadrian's Wall, after Segedunum (Wallsend), Pons Aelius (Newcastle), Condercum and Vindobala. It is situated about seven and a half miles west of Vindobala, and is two and a half miles north of Corstopitum. The site of the fort is bisected by the B6318 Military Road, which runs along the route of the wall at that point. Description The fort guards Dere Street as it crosses the Roman Wall through the valley immediately to the west of it. The original fort was an oblong, measuring north to south by east to west, but at a later date the section south of the Wall was extended to the west making the south wall of the fort long and giving the fort an L-shaped appearance. The areas occupied by the northern and southern sections are 4.3 and respectively. There were four main gates, at the main points of the compass, with double portals with guard chambers. At various times some of the portals have been blocked up and both portals of the west gate were blocked almost at once. There were towers at each corner of the fort, and also on either side of the main gates. It is believed that the fort was built between 122 AD and 126 AD. The Vallum passed some short distance south of the fort, and was crossed by a road leading from the south gate to vicus just south of the Vallum. Garrison A dedicatory slab from the west gate of the fort tells us that the Legio VI Victrix were responsible for the initial building work. The fort was initially garrisoned, probably, by a cohort of 500 partly mounted troops. In the third century it held a regiment of cavalry, the Ala I Pannoniorum Sabiniana, also called Ala Sabiniana, and named after Sabinus who first raised it Excavations The field north of the Military Road containing the northern section of the fort was first ploughed in 1827, and a fine bath-house was found. This contained dry and moist hot rooms, a warm room and cold rooms, and a dressing room. Such a large bath-house is a rarity on the Wall. References * J.

The vaccine was developed by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and patented in September 2006. The vaccine was one of the H1N1 vaccines approved for use by the European Commission in September 2009, upon the recommendations of the European Medicines Agency (EMEA). The vaccine is only approved for use when an H1N1 influenza pandemic has been officially declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) or European Union (EU). The vaccine was initially developed as a pandemic mock-up vaccine using an H5N1 strain. In August 2010, The Swedish Medical Products Agency (MPA) and The Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) launched investigations regarding the development of narcolepsy as a possible side effect to Pandemrix flu vaccination in children, and found a 6.6-fold increased risk among children and youths, resulting in 3.6 additional cases of narcolepsy per 100,000 vaccinated subjects.Report from an epidemiological study in Sweden on vaccination with Pandemrix and narcolepsy, Swedish medical product agency, June 30, 2011. Stanford University studies suggested that narcolepsy is an autoimmune disease and that it appears to be triggered by upper airway respiratory infections in China, where 2009 H1N1 vaccines did not contain adjuvants. Constituents As well as the active antigen derived from A/California/7/2009 (H1N1), the vaccine contains an immunologic adjuvant AS03 which consists of DL-Œ±-tocopherol (vitamin E), squalene and polysorbate 80. Thiomersal (thimerosal) is added as a preservative. Being manufactured in chicken eggs, it contains trace amounts of egg proteins. Additional important non-medicinal ingredients are formaldehyde, sodium deoxycholate, and sucrose. =Use of adjuvant= While other 2009 H1N1 vaccines have been developed, the use of a proprietary immunologic adjuvant is claimed to boost the potency of the body's immune response, meaning that only a quarter of the inactivated virus is needed. Professor David Salisbury, Head of Immunisation at the UK Department of Health said the vaccines with adjuvants offer good protection even if the virus changes over time; \\"One of the advantages with adjuvanted vaccines is their ability to protect against drifted (mutated) strains. It opens the door for a whole new strategy in dealing with flu.\\" Dosage The vaccine is supplied in separate vials, one containing the adjuvant, and the other the inactivated virus, which require mixing before intramuscular injection. Originally it was thought that two doses given 21 days apart would be required for full efficacy. Subsequent testing has allowed the UK programme to consist of just a single dose for most people, with a two-dose schedule for children under the age of 10 years and immunocompromised adults. Availability As of 3 December 2009, 11.2 million doses of Pandemrix had been delivered to health services in the UK, where the vaccine forms the bulk of the government's mass vaccination programme. The Marketing Authorisation from the European Medicines Agency expired in August 2015 when GSK Biologicals did not apply for renewal of it citing lack of demand for the vaccine.European Medicines Agency, Public Statement, EMA/656472/2015 \\"Pandemrix Expiry of the marketing authorisation in the European Union\\" 19 October 2015 Clinical trials The EMEA reported results from some clinical trials in the CHMP Assessment Report. These relate to vaccination against H5N1 (Bird Flu) and not H1N1 (Swine Flu). *H5N1-007 was initiated at a single site in Belgium (Ghent) in March 2006. *H5N1-008 was initiated at 41 sites in seven countries (6 EU MS plus Russia) in May 2006. *H5N1-002 was initiated on 24 March 2007 in four SE Asian countries. GlaxoSmithKline reported results from the second clinical trial, from the pediatric clinical trial, and the response from the elderly population. Side effects According to GlaxoSmithKline's Patient Information Leaflet, the following side effects may occur (sorted by rate of occurrence): * Very common (affects more than 1 in 10 people) ** Headache ** Tiredness ** Pain, redness, swelling or a hard lump at the injection site ** Fever ** Aching muscles, joint pain * Common (affects at least 1 in 100 people) ** Warmth, itching or bruising at the injection site ** Increased sweating, shivering, flu-like symptoms ** Swollen glands in the neck, armpit or groin * Uncommon (affects at least 1 in 1,000 people) ** Tingling or numbness of the hands or feet ** General constitutional upset of sleepiness or sleeplessness, generally feeling unwell, dizziness. ** Diarrhea, vomiting, stomach pain, feeling sick ** Skin reactions of itching, rash or urticaria (hives) * Rare (affects at least 1 in 10,000 people) ** Serious generalised allergic reactions of anaphylaxis ** Fits ** Severe stabbing or throbbing pain along one or more nerves ** Low blood platelet count which can result in bleeding or bruising * Very Rare (affects less than 1 in 10,000 people) ** Vasculitis ** Neurological disorders such as encephalomyelitis, neuritis or Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome temporary paralysis Narcolepsy investigations In the summer of 2010, the Swedish Medical Products Agency (MPA) and the Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) received reports from Swedish and Finnish healthcare professionals that narcolepsy was a suspected adverse drug reaction to the Pandemrix flu vaccination. The reports concern children 12 to 16 years old, whose symptoms occurred one to two months after vaccination. The symptoms were later confirmed to be compatible with narcolepsy. Consumer reports describing similar symptoms were also received. Both organizations, in consultation with external experts, have assessed the possible relationship between the vaccination and the reported reactions. MPA and THL have been in contact with other EU member states to enquire whether there have been any similar reports in other countries. THL recommended that further Pandemrix vaccinations be discontinued pending further investigation into 15 cases of recently vaccinated children who developed narcolepsy in late 2009 and early 2010. THL later raised this figure to 17; the expected average annual occurrence is 6 cases. In Sweden, MPA has discovered 12 confirmed cases and another 12 suspected cases. Additionally, MPA says it is aware of individual case reports from France, Norway and Germany. On 27 August 2010, the European Medicines Agency announced that the agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use would be launching a review of Pandemrix in light of the \\"limited number of cases\\" reported in Finland and Sweden, so as to \\"determine whether there is evidence for a causal association\\". In August 2010 the Swedish MPA issued a statement which included the following: \\"An investigation is ongoing, but any relationship between the vaccination and the reported symptoms can not be concluded.\\" In February 2011, THL concluded that there is a clear connection between the Pandemrix vaccination campaign of 2009 and 2010 and the narcolepsy epidemic in Finland. The probability of developing narcolepsy was determined to be nine times higher in those who received the Pandemrix vaccination than those who didn't. A total of 152 cases of narcolepsy have been found in Finland during 2009‚Äì2010, and ninety percent of them had received the Pandemrix vaccination. Authorities believe that the number of cases may still increase. At the end of March 2011, an MPA press release stated: \\"Results from a Swedish registry based cohort study indicate a 4-fold increased risk of narcolepsy in children and adolescents below the age of 20 vaccinated with Pandemrix, compared to children of the same age that were not vaccinated.\\" The same study found no increased risk in adults who were vaccinated with Pandemrix. While cautioning that the increase in risk for children is still uncertain in magnitude, it recommends they not be vaccinated. A study by the Stanford University School of Medicine examined the incidence of narcolepsy in relation to upper airway infection and a H1N1 vaccine (not Pandemrix) in Chinese patients. Their principal conclusion was that an increased incidence of narcolepsy was seen following a wave of upper airway infections (such as H1N1 influenza). They found no correlation between vaccination and narcolepsy. According to the authors, \\"the new finding of an association with infection, and not vaccination, is important as it suggests that limiting vaccination because of a fear of narcolepsy could actually increase overall risk.\\" Since narcolepsy is now believed to be an autoimmune disease, the authors suspect that these upper airway infections trigger an immune response which leads ultimately to narcolepsy in susceptible individuals. Pandemrix contains two adjuvants designed to provoke a stronger immune response; they were not in the vaccine used in China, however. In 2013, the New Scientist reported that \\"part of a surface protein on the pandemic virus looks very similar to part of a brain protein that helps keep people awake\\". However, the original scientific article claiming that HA protein in both the virus and the vaccine could, in some people, trigger an immune reaction against hypocretin, was recently retracted because the data could not be reproduced. However, further investigations indicated that \\"antibodies to influenza nucleoprotein cross- react with human hypocretin receptor 2\\". https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/07/why-pandemic-flu-shot-caused- narcolepsy In 2014, a Finnish group published results that showed Pandemrix contained a higher amounts of structurally altered viral nucleoproteins than Arepanrix, a similar vaccine not associated with narcolepsy. In 2015, it was reported that the British Department of Health was paying for Sodium oxybate medication for 80 patients who are taking legal action over problems linked to the use of the swine flu vaccine, at a cost to the government of ¬£12,000 per patient per year. Sodium oxybate is not available to patients with narcolepsy through the National Health Service.

A member of the Republican, he served as a member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and was the 82nd Mayor of Philadelphia from 1916 until 1920. Biography Smith was born November 2, 1868 in Philadelphia. Prior to this political career, he worked for the Pennsylvania Railroad, The Philadelphia Record and the National Surety Co. of New York. He entered politics as the Republican Party‚Äôs chairman for the 28th Ward and won election to the Common Council, which was the lower house of the Philadelphia City Council. In 1905, he won a seat in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, where he served one term. Later he secured appointments as postmaster for the city of Philadelphia and the Public Service Commissioner. =Mayor of Philadelphia= In 1915, he ran for mayor and defeated George Porter in the general election. During the 1917 primary election, Smith, who was allied with William Scott Vare‚Äôs political machine, supported Issac Deutsch in for the Republican nomination. Jim McNichol, who was part of the Boies Penrose machine, supported James Carey. Deutsch‚Äôs supporters brought a gang from New York who attacked Carey. During the melee, a police officer, George Eppley, was shot and killed. Much of the blame fell on Smith, who, as mayor, controlled the police, worked to ensure that the officers assigned to the district would support Vare‚Äôs candidate and harass supporters of Carey. The District Attorney, Samuel Rotan, who was a Penrose ally, indicted Mayor Smith for ‚Äòconspiracy to commit murder‚Äô as well as impeding a free and fair election. While he was acquitted of the charges, the cloud of suspicion hung over the mayor for the remainder of his term. Smith died April 17, 1949 in Abington Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.

It is a sequel Wanted: Monty Mole released the previous year. While the game was marketed as Monty Is Innocent, it is never referred to by that title in-game; instead it merely displays Great Escape!. The inlay also features this title, on the newspaper that Monty Mole is reading in his cell.  Story  Monty Mole has been sentenced to five years in Scudmore Prison for stealing a bucket of coal. Monty's best friend, the mysterious masked rodent, Sam Stoat, is determined to set Monty free. Sam must face the evil forces, lurking in the depths of Scudmore, and rescue Monty.  Gameplay  While billed as a sequel to the game Wanted: Monty Mole, Monty Is Innocent is very different; in addition to the obvious difference (the player controls Sam Stoat, rather than Monty) the previous Monty Mole game was a platform game whereas Monty Is Innocent is a linked, multi-screen 3D maze game. The player must collect a key from the Governor's office to open a cell door. There are eight keys (which open eight doors) and the player must return to the office each time until the key to open Monty's cell is found. A number of bottles containing a magic disappearing potion can be found around the prison, which will cause Sam to become invisible for a short time. There is also an armoury which contains an endless supply of guns, although the weapons have only five bullets each. Points are scored for completing the game; the faster the game is completed, the more points are awarded.  Reception  Reviews were mixed, with CRASH giving the game 78%. and Sinclair User awarding 7/10, while Sinclair Programs gave only 40%. CRASH declared that \\"Monty Is Innocent is great.

Retargeting tags online users by including a pixel within the target webpage or email, which sets a cookie in the user's browser. Once the cookie is set, the advertiser is able to show display ads to that user elsewhere on the internet via an ad exchange. Dynamic creative (also known as personalized retargeting), allows an advertiser to display a banner created on-the-fly for a particular consumer based on specific pages that they viewed. For example, if a consumer visits an advertiser's website and browses products A, B, and C ‚Äì they will then be retargeted with a display banner featuring the exact products A, B, and C that they previously viewed. This is typically restricted to the visitor's browsing on a single website. A refined version improves on re-engagement with customers. If a customer begins an online order, for example, but fails to complete it, a flag indicates they had an interest in the product being ordered. Later, ads showing the product of interest can be custom-linked to point back into the order system. When the user clicks on the ad, they are returned to their incomplete order. Such an implementation requires that the order system support deep linking or other retargeting services. Types While all retargeting depends on setting cookies in a user's browser, there are several different methods of doing this: * Site retargeting * Search retargeting * Link retargeting * Email retargeting *Social retargeting Pricing Retargeting ad campaigns usually run on lower cost media, such as display ads, which not only increases effectiveness by specifically targeting an interested audience, but also improves the overall ROI of the advertiser. A common use-case of retargeting is situations where a website visitor's actions did not result in a sale or conversion. Retargeting providers employ a variety of pricing models to charge advertisers for the ads viewed by consumers. Three prominent models include: * CPM (Cost per mille or cost per thousand) * CPC (cost per click) * CPA (cost per action) Cost per impression (CPM) is a common metric used in the online advertising industry to charge advertisers for inventory based on a set price per thousand-page impressions. An impression is defined as any time a banner ad loads on an individual's web browser. Pay per click (PPC) charges advertisers for every verifiable click that leads consumers back to a retailer's website. Unlike the CPM model, which charges advertisers a flat rate, advertisers working under the PPC model are only charged when a person clicks on an ad. Cost per action (CPA) is a pricing model in which advertisers are charged based on pre- arranged action (a purchase, a view through, etc.), although a completed sale is the most common action used under the CPA model. Concerns In the United States, several organizations, including the Federal Trade Commission, Congress and the media, have expressed privacy concerns around the practice of retargeting; however, responsible personalized retargeting providers don't collect personally identifiable information (PII) on consumers. Providers should be blind to a user's age, sex and other personal information. Instead, providers rely upon data gathered from cookies that are placed on a consumer's browser by the websites they visit. This information should not be shared among publishers, other advertisers or third parties and cannot be linked to a specific user. The United States has not legislated many laws around the practice, and instead relies upon the industry and its overarching organizations, such as the Interactive Advertising Bureau, Network Advertising Initiative and TRUSTe to self-regulate. In October 2010, the IAB announced its Advertising Option Icon, which partner sites will place near banner advertisements that collect non-PII user data. In the EU, the 2002 ePrivacy Directive and its 2009 revision require opt-in consent for the use of cookies and stipulate that users must be given the option of opting out.

Jackson Knight (\\"Jack/Jackson/J.K.\\") was born in Sutton in Surrey on 20 October 1895, the son of George Knight and his wife, Caroline Louisa Jackson.Birth registered in Epsom Registration District in the last quarter of 1895. George Wilson Knight, Jackson Knight: a biography (1975), passim. He was educated at Kingswood House, a preparatory school in Epsom, as a day boy, before going on to Dulwich College. He was elected to one of two Open Classical Scholarships at Hertford College, Oxford in December 1913. Great Britain having entered the First World War in August 1914, Knight volunteered for full-time military service and was attested in the Royal Engineers at Kingston-on-Thames on 1 November 1915. He was posted to the Motorcyclist Company, Signal Depot, Royal Engineers at Dunstable, trained, and posted to the British Expeditionary Force in France, where he landed on 21 December 1915. He served on operations in France and Flanders as a Motorcyclist Corporal, mustered as despatch rider, until he returned to England to undergo officer training in 1917. He was discharged from the Army to take up a temporary commission on 21 August 1917.UK National Archives, War Office: Soldiers‚Äô Documents, First World War ‚ÄòBurnt Documents‚Äô (Microfilm Copies). Commissioned temporary Second Lieutenant, Royal Engineers, on 22 August 1917, he returned to France, where he continued to serve on operations until wounded in action in the summer of 1918, arranging signals equipment in the front line on the Somme. He was evacuated to England for treatment in August 1918, being admitted to Epsom Hospital. ‚ÄúThe wounds were bad. ‚ÄòDressings ripped off behind my knee‚Äô 18‚Äô (i.e. 1918), he wrote (1951), ‚Äòthe orderly fainted, visu exsanguis!‚Äîgave me bad moments.‚Äô Amputation was at first expected ‚Ä¶ but the leg was saved. There was considerable suffering with shell-shock.‚ÄùGeorge Wilson Knight, op. cit., p. 56. Knight survived the war and was eventually demobilised and released from the army, retaining the rank of Lieutenant, in January 1920. Thereafter he ‚Äúalways carried a stick, having been very seriously wounded ‚Ä¶ . More often than not he carried it under his arm, and this often caused it to come in contact with passers-by.‚Äù George Wilson Knight, op. cit., p. 5. Despite his keen appetite for soldiering, Knight had an unusual perspective on the war, ‚ÄúIt was such a frightfully dressy affair ‚Ä¶ Not only the generals, but their ADC‚Äôs and all the junior staff officers wore gorget patches on their lapels.‚ÄùGeorge Wilson Knight, op. cit., p. 368. Teaching career After some months teaching at a preparatory school and a cramming establishment, Knight returned to Hertford College, Oxford in September 1920. Having taken a Second in Greats in 1922, he was appointed to the staff of All Saints' School, Bloxham in Oxfordshire in 1925. His time at Bloxham was memorable chiefly for his impact on the school cadet corps: First appointed as a Lieutenant, Officers Training Corps, General List, Territorial Army, for service with the Bloxham School Contingent, Junior Division, Officers Training Corps, in October 1925, he was promoted to Captain and assumed command of the unit in November 1926. He achieved a considerable reputation for turning the Contingent into one of the best units of its kind in the United Kingdom, and received official recognition for himself and the school in being promoted to Brevet Major when he relinquished command with effect from 1 January 1932.The London Gazette (27 October 1925), p. 6922; (30 November 1926), p. 7817; (1 January 1932), p. 51. George Wilson Knight, op.cit., pp. 3, 105. He left Bloxham School, after ten years' service, in July 1935. Classical scholar and academic During this period Knight had started to become more and more active in classical scholarship: ‚ÄúIn the early nineteen-thirties, readers of the learned journals in both Britain and the United States became aware of the work of a classical scholar called WFJ Knight, writing from Bloxham School in Oxfordshire. The articles were not only numerous, erudite, and very wide-ranging; they were also, in more ways than one, distinctly original‚Äù (Wiseman).T.P. Wiseman, Talking to Virgil: a miscellany (1992), p. 171. In 1932, for examble, he published ‚ÄúMagical Motives in Seneca's Troades‚Äù in The Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association(vol. 63) (1932), pp. 20‚Äì33. and the book, Vergil‚Äôs Troy, essays on the 2nd book of the Aeneid.(Oxford: Basil Blackwell) (Virgilian Studies Series). pp. ix + 158. Having left Bloxham in 1935, he spent a short time as a temporary lecturer in the University of St. Andrews, and then, in January 1936 accepted an appointment as Assistant Lecturer in Classics at the University College of South West England in Exeter.Exeter & Plymouth Gazette (Friday, 7 February 1936), p. 9. MS 75:Knight Family Papers, c 1920‚Äì1975, Archival description at the University of Exeter. Once arrived, he was also made Warden of Great Duryard House, one of the College Halls of Residence (afterwards Thomas Hall). And ‚Äì despite \\"strenuous opposition from some students,\\" he founded and took temporary command of the University College (Exeter) Contingent, Senior Division, Officers' Training Corps, in November 1936.Exeter & Plymouth Gazette (Friday, 18 December 1936), p. 20. B.W. Clapp, The University of Exeter: a history (1982), p. 93. He was appointed Reader in Classical Literature in 1942. Notwithstanding the pressures of change in his personal circumstances and academic duties, he published a major work, Cumaean Gates in 1936, of which it has been said, ‚ÄúKnight had little gift for sustained and coherent argument and exposition, and he could, under the influence of whatever book or article he had just been reading, write what can only be described as nonsense. Yet he was a remarkable man, who certainly widened the knowledge and the sensibilities of readers of Virgil; and ‚Ä¶ he had a power to stimulate and inspire which is not given to many classical scholars‚Äù (M.L. Clarke).Review in The Classical Review (New Series), (vol. 18, no. 3) (December 1968), p. 354. Cumaean Gates was followed by Accentual Symmetry in Vergil in 1939,(Oxford: Blackwell) (Virgilian Studies Series). pp. x + 107. Roman Vergil in 1944,(London: Faber and Faber). pp. viii + 348.

Knight (who always preferred to spell the Roman author's name as \\"Vergil\\"), helped to found, and was appointed as an honorary Joint Secretary of, the Virgil Society in 1943. He served as President of the Society during 1949‚Äì1950. He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1945 and as an Honorary Life Member of the International Mark Twain Society (USA) in 1946, and he attended, and played a prominent role in, the constituent assembly of the Sodalitas Erasmiana in Rome in September 1949. 1950 was a very significant year in Knight's life. On 8 July 1950 his beloved mother, Mrs. Caroline Louisa Knight, died. The following month Knight flew to South Africa, where he visited and lectured at the University of the Witwatersrand. He also visited Cape Town, and lectured at the University of Cape Town. His friend Theodore Johannes Haarhoff, Professor of Classics in the University of the Witwatersrand, subsequently wrote that his visit 'was a great success although he was a difficult guest.' (quoted in Gosling)\\"They first met in 1935, although they had already been corresponding for some time, and it was Haarhoff who was responsible for recommending Jackson Knight to a post at Exeter, where he spent the rest of his working life. Haarhoff believed himself to be in communication with Heraclitus, among others, and in 1951 first made contact with Virgil, initially through a medium, but increasingly through automatic writing. Both on his own account and on behalf of Jackson Knight, who had begun work on his Penguin translation of the Aeneid in the same year, he consulted Virgil on the meaning of disputed passages in the epic\\" (M.A. Gosling, \\"Unde Animae Excitantur\\" in Scholia Reviews (no. 2) (1993). The following year, 1951, he began work on what is arguably his most famous work, the Penguin Classics edition of The Aeneid, which was eventually published in 1956 as Virgil, The Aeneid, A New Translation. But his scholarly reputation was now increasingly tarnished by his spiritualism. \\"The most astonishing part of Knight's life was his concern with spiritualism. ... When he began his Penguin Aeneid translation, T.J. Haarhoff, 'who had for years claimed spirit- contacts with Vergil himself ‚Ä¶ now put his powers at Jack's service'‚Ä¶ . Vergil visited Haarhoff 'every Tuesday evening' and wrote out answers to questions raised by Knight, whom Vergil regularly called 'Agrippa.' ‚ÄòHe still does,' writes Haarhoff in January 1968 ‚Ä¶ . Vergil then began to contact Knight 'directly at Exeter' warning him 'to go slow and be extra careful about the \\"second half.\\"' Knight gratefully dedicated his translation to Haarhoff. After Knight's death ‚Ä¶ Haarhoff [was] assured by a medium that 'Vergil met him when he went over' (Calder)W.M. Calder, Review (untitled) in The Classical World (vol. 70, no. 6) (1977), at p. 404. \\"Clearly Haarhoff, or Haarhoff's Virgil, influenced Jackson Knight's translation, but equally clearly Jackson Knight kept his critical faculties alert and did not blindly accept everything Haarhoff reported Virgil to have said\\" (Gosling, op. cit.) See also D.P. Harmon 'Talking to Virgil', Bryn Mawr Classical Review 03.04.16 (1992). Review of T.P. Wiseman, Talking to Virgil, 1992. Retirement and death Knight retired from Exeter University in 1961, and died, aged 69 years, in Frenchay Hospital in Bristol on 4 December 1964. He never married.Death registered in Bristol Registration District in the last quarter of 1964. Jackson Knight left a strong impression on people. Cecil Day-Lewis, afterwards Poet Laureate, remembered his first meeting with him in the nineteen thirties: ‚Äúa dapper, dandyish figure, a high-pitched voice ‚Äî which later I was to describe as ‚Äòthe sound of a demented seagull‚Äô, and alternating of enthusiasm with moodiness.‚ÄùGeorge Wilson Knight, op.cit., p. 11. Day-Lewis was himself a translator of The Aeneid, rendering it in modern English verse, comparable to Vergil's original, unlike Jackson Knight's modern English prose.

It came as a result of the merger between the Water Supply Foundation and the Agricultural Foundation. Over the years many different programs have developed to help the rural communities of Poland.  History The foundation was created by two separate organizations merging. The Water Supply Foundation and The Agricultural Foundation make up what is now the current Rural Development Foundation. Water Supply Foundation This organization was established in 1987 from negotiations between the Catholic Church and the Communist regime. The main goal was to allow foundations to exist because the state had owned all property and existing foundations by law since 1952. The Water Supply Foundation supplied grants and loans to construct water and sewage systems in rural communities. Also, the foundation worked to organize trainings for locals starting small businesses, agrotourism, environmental protection, and learning about democracy. Agricultural Foundation This organization began in 1991. The main goal was to make rural communities less dependent on agriculture by creating other options for income. The foundation made this possible through supplying loans to people so they could become more independent and establish their own work places. The Agricultural Foundation was the only non-governmental organization in the country at the time and supported small water retention projects and reconstructing small hydro-electric power sites.  Programs  =Micro-Loan Program= One of the Rural Development Foundation's main objectives is to support non-agricultural business while fighting rural unemployment. the Micro-loan program started in 2003 to give to individuals of rural communities who wish to start their own small business. The maximum amount that could be loaned is 20,000 PLN (4,654.47 USD) and were given free of interest between 24‚Äì36 months. To date only a half percent of microloan recipients have not been able to repay their loan. The program reaches Voivodships all over Poland from the north to the south. Hydroelectric and Wind Power Stations This part of the loan program lends money to people who are investing in small hydroelectric or wind power stations. This part of the program has been going since 1994 and is the only program of its kind in Poland. =Financial Education= Since 2008, the Rural Development Foundation (RDF) partnered with Polish National Bank and Microfinance Center (MFC) to create a Financial Education program for Polish village residents. Throughout Poland‚Äôs rural areas, like most of Eastern Europe, the financial literacy rate is extremely low and has often been found to contribute to stagnant low-income levels among families. According to the Microfinance Center, this is a result of communist times when managing individual finances was discouraged. Decades later, still a majority of Poland‚Äôs population does not use any form of credit or have any long-term savings plan. This has become a growing concern for both the elderly and low-income families and for the future growth of Poland‚Äôs economy. The program has been structured in two parts. First, courses are held to train up trainers to teach future classes in more villages. Then the trainers go to their towns and villages to offer classes. The first series was on ‚ÄúHow to budget expenses‚Äù and then a second series on ‚ÄúWhat is credit and how do I manage it?‚Äù By 2009, the next phase of the Financial Education initiative was called ‚ÄúPlan Your Future.‚Äù RDF put together these workshops with the support of the Polish National Bank. There were nearly 150 new trainers and 50 villages participating with approximately 1,000 workshops held for rural area residents to attend. The Rural Development Foundation has plans to continue the financial education program for more Polish village residents to be more informed and live better lives because of it. =Program e-VITA= Since January 2004 the Rural Development Foundation (RDF) in partnership with the Polish-American Freedom Foundation has organized the \\"Active Village, Building the Information Society, e-VITA‚Äù program. The e-VITA program brings technology and information to residents of Poland‚Äôs villages by working with local governments in making technology more readily available in rural areas. This is done through both establishing infrastructure and networks as well as educating residents on how it works. By providing more people access to the Internet villages are able to communicate faster, find better solutions to common problems, and broaden their understanding of the world. The program has been implemented in two editions, first in 2004-05 and then from 2006‚Äì08. Each edition has three main objectives: to support selected communities in the use of information technology, build portal for rural areas to be able to have internet connection, and then hold classes for community members to learn how to use the new technology. These two editions of e-VITA program have built enough networks for 1,967 village residents to access the Internet. The networks have especially benefitted schools, health facilities, recreational areas, and libraries. Furthermore, villages have taken their own initiatives to use the Internet to promote municipal information, cultural heritage festivals, and along with many other weekly events. Today, the third edition of e-VITA now focuses two tasks. The first is on activities for design and construction of computer networks in 27 municipalities. At the same time, e-VITA provides locals support though free expert advisory assistance for construction of networks, advise in preparing EU grant applications, and training for local leaders in the planning and implementation of technical projects. The second task of e-VITA is known as ‚Äòround table‚Äô debates. These debates bring together experts in technology, local government officials, NGO leaders, and business representatives to host discussions on relevant community topics for the public to attend. E-VITA has developed a close partnership with local governments and NGO‚Äôs and they have been essential to the success of the program. Through e-VITA‚Äôs success a nationwide web portal has recently been launched to provide a one-stop source for up-to-date information for Polish villagers to use. The website,Witryna Wiejska has become an essential meeting place for thousands of people from all over Poland to find useful information. The progress of the e-VITA program has had an extremely important role in building a technologically savvy society. The interest of local authorities and their understanding of these issues is an essential to gain success in these rural area residents. RDF will continue to work with other NGO‚Äôs, business and government leaders to speed the growth of access to networks for more communities throughout Poland in the future. =Training and Education Programs= left This program includes developing agro-tourism, planning projects to benefit local communities, and internet instruction for senior citizens. Sometimes training is done in three-day workshop settings and sometimes skills are taught through a course. People over 50 years old are trained to use a computer and to navigate their way through the internet. Another effective way for villagers to educate themselves is through the attending the nationwide conference of all active organizations in rural areas. This meeting is a good way for people to broaden their horizon by exchanging information and gaining ideas and knowledge. =Witryna Wiejska Website= This website is meant to give practical advice, information, and direct help to its users, but also to display current topics on education, advising, financing and life in local communities. The website developed from Atlas Initiative through an agreement between the Foundation and organizations that funding would be supplied for their projects in exchange for sharing their success stories online. This link still exists on the site today with listings of projects that worked well. =Internet competitions for young people= There are two internet competitions for students in secondary schools in Poland. The first is called Know Poland and teaches students how to find information about Poland on the internet. The winners of the contest are awarded a three day stay in Warsaw, with their parents and also receive diplomas or certificates for their achievements. There is also a Know America internet contest where students fill out a questionnaire about the United States online. This project is coordinated through the United States Embassy in Poland and with Collegium Civitas. The Rural Development Foundation administers the program and Collegium Civitas provides a lecture on the United States. It is a great opportunity for students across Poland to gain a better understanding of their country and the United States. =Grant Competition Programs= \\"With 10,000 PLN, how can one improve the quality of life in our village, parish, or post-state farm settlement?\\" This is the question asked to the local NGO participants in this grant competition. This program's focus is to improve the quality of life in rural villages. NGO organizations such as associations, societies, foundations, religious organizations, private care establishments, youth organizations, rural minicentres, women's organizations, urban renewal groups, rural administrations, rural administration councils, parishes, voluntary fire brigades, and rural women's circles are allowed to submit an application. Applicants with projects fulfilling requirements can be awarded up to 10,000 PLN. Protection of Biodiversity This program works to make villagers want to preserve old species of flowers and plant life through grants for local projects. The program further encourages care for native livestock and wild animals in Poland that include, but are not limited to, the preservation of cows, pigs, sheep and horses. Past Projects right =The \\"Razem\\" Partnership- EQUAL= The Rural Development Foundation partners with EQUAL in \\"Eurovillage\\" partnership. This program focuses on getting people jobs who have not been employed before or who were unemployed. One of the main projects this program focuses on is creating thematic villages. These villages normally have high unemployment and very little opportunity for education. By preparing a thematic village, jobs will be created and allow people to avoid future unemployment. The themed villages will also attract outside investors (depending on the theme) and encourage young Poles to not emigrate from their village. The RDF has created 'Hobbiton' in Sierak√≥w S≈Çawie≈Ñski, obviously themed after hobbits. =Pre-School Children's Clubs= This program comes from a partnership among the Rural Development Foundation, the Polish Children's Development Centre in Lublin, and the Teacher Training and Ongoing Education Centre in Suwa≈Çki. This group works to find alternative forms of pre-school education in rural communities in order to create equal education opportunities between rural and urban children. In areas where no pre-schools exist, Pre-School Children's Clubs are created to benefit teachers, students, and parents.

At the beginning of the development of this area of linguistics, Ignace Gelb coined the term grammatology for this discipline; later some scholars suggested calling it graphologyUsed in this sense e.g. in The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language, second edition, Cambridge University Press, 1997. to match phonology, but that name is traditionally used for a pseudo-science. Others therefore suggested renaming the study of language-dependent pronunciation phonemics or phonematics instead, but this did not gain widespread acceptance either, so the terms graphemics and graphematics became more frequent. Graphemics examines the specifics of written texts in a certain language and their correspondence to the spoken language. One major task is the descriptive analysis of implicit regularities in written words and texts (graphotactics) to formulate explicit rules (orthography) for the writing system that can be used in prescriptive education or in computer linguistics, e.g. for speech synthesis. In analogy to phoneme and (allo)phone in phonology, the graphic units of language are graphemes, i.e. language-specific characters, and graphs, i.e. language- specific glyphs. Different schools of thought consider different entities to be graphemes; major points of divergence are the handling of punctuation, diacritic marks, digraphs or other multigraphs and non-alphabetic scripts. Analogous to phonetics, the \\"etic\\" counterpart of graphemics is called graphetics and deals with the material side only (including paleography, typography and graphology). Graphotactics Graphotactics refers to rules which restrict the allowable sequences of letters in alphabetic languages.Carney, Edward. A common example is the partially correct \\"I before E except after C\\". However, there are exceptions, for example Edward Carney in his book, A Survey of English Spelling, refers to the \\"I before E except after C‚Äù rule instead as an example of a ‚Äúphonotactic rule‚Äù.Carney, Edward. Graphotactical rules are useful in error detection by optical character recognition systems. In studies of Old English, \\"graphotactics\\" is also used to refer to the variable-length spacing between words.

It contains 14 structures located along three streets: East Forest, Garfield, and East Canfield, between Woodward Avenue on the west and John R. on the east. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.  History  The area where this district is now located was originally settled by Detroit's wealthier citizens in the 1880s, seeking suburban homes near Woodward Avenue and well out of downtown. Early residents included Detroit Edison Company presidents Alex Dow, president of ; Herman Kiefer Hospital founder Dr. Guy L. Kiefer, and Detroit College of Medicine professor Dr. Nathaniel Webber. Around 1900, the area was a major center for Jewish Detroiters, as well as medical staff working at the hospitals nearby. The neighborhood remained substantially Jewish through the 1930s. As population pressure increased, however, apartments were constructed and what once were large single family homes were subdivided. In 1936, the first nightclub in what is now the Sugar Hill District opened, the Harlem Cave. Meanwhile, Detroit's first African American residents settled in Black Bottom and Paradise Valley. As the black population grew into the 1930s, the Paradise Valley area expanded up Hastings Street to Warren Avenue, and developed onto the parallel streets of St. Antoine, Beaubien, and Brush. Rebuilding caused many residents living near downtown to move northward.The Foundation, Quarterly Newsletter of the Detroit Historic Commission, Winter 2003 However, the areas where black residents could move were limited due to enforced housing restrictions and covenants, and the areas on John R and westward remained segregated. In 1941, however, Ernest White purchased the Gotham Hotel at the corner of John R and Orchestra Place just south of this district. Although the purchase was apparently a case of mistaken racial identity, it set a precedent, and more African-Americans began moving and establishing businesses in the area. At the same time, more clubs opened in the Sugar Hill district, some Jewish-owned, but an increasing number owned by African- Americans. By 1950 what had been a quiet residential neighborhood became a thriving entertainment district. The area east of Woodward where the Detroit Medical Center now stands became the center of the nightlife jazz scene in Detroit. Some of the greatest musicians of the time stayed in hotels and played in clubs in the area. These included Count Basie, Billie Holiday, Muddy Waters, B. B. King, Dinah Washington, and John Lee Hooker. In addition, the entertainment world became gradually integrated as \\"black and tan\\" clubs - nightclubs open to patrons of both races - opened in the 1940s. The Sugar Hill jazz district flourished into the 1960s, and played a major factor in the early careers of Berry Gordy, Al Green, Jackie Wilson, Marvin Gaye, and other young performers who would go on the establish the Motown sound. However, the targeted urban renewal of the 1960s decimated Paradise Valley, and the expansion of the hospitals in the Detroit Medical Center area caused the demolition of what had been the heart of the entertainment district. In particular, a number of former clubs were razed to make room for the construction of the John Dingell Detroit Veterans' Administration Hospital in the 1990s. The remaining structures in the Sugar Hill district were considered for demolition as late as the 1990s. However, there has been recent investment in the district. In June 2010, the rehabilitation of the Garfield Manor Apartments (71 Garfield) was completed. The building is intended as artist residences and studios and includes solar power, solar water heaters, water reclamation, and geothermal heating. Plans call next for a residential and commercial building to be constructed on the corner of John R. and Garfield. The building will be dubbed the \\"Sugar Hill Building.\\" Description The Sugar Hill Historic District contains 14 structures constructed between 1885 and 1938, including single-family houses, apartment buildings, a church, and commercial buildings. The district is the largest portion remaining of a flourishing 1940s and 1950s neighborhood which had a large concentration of black-owned or operated jazz venues other commercial enterprises. The Garfield Building (separately designated on the National Register) stands at the corner of Woodward and Garfield in the center of the district, as does the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit. These buildings, although physically adjacent to the Sugar Hill Historic District, are not included in the district proper. Two of the structures in the district have been demolished: the York Apartments at 74 Garfield, which was demolished after a fire in the summer of 2008, and the Randora Hotel at 92-98 Garfield, demolished in 2009. The structures included in the district are: =Houses= * Agnes Inglis house, 102 Garfield (1891) This house was built for Agnes Inglis in 1891, and was the home of Alex Dow from 1907 to 1922.

It changed the diphthongs ie [i…ô], uo [u…ô] and √ºe [y…ô] to respectively ie [iÀê], u [uÀê] and √º [yÀê]: before 11th century > nowadays liebe [i…ô] > liebe [iÀê] guote [u…ô] > gute [uÀê] br√ºeder [y…ô] > Br√ºder [yÀê] The digraph \\"ie\\" has kept its spelling despite monophthongization. The New High German monophthongization started in the 11th century in the center of the German-speaking area. Bavarian and Alemannic dialects in the south did not undergo the monophthongization changes and thus these dialects remain in an older language state. Greek Greek underwent monophthongization at many points during its history. For instance, the diphthongs monophthongized to around the 5th century BC, and the diphthong monophthongized to in the Koine Greek period. For more information, see and Koine Greek phonology. French French underwent monophthongization and so the digraph , which formerly represented a diphthong, represents the sound or in Modern French. Similarly, the digraph and trigraph represent the monophthong due to the same process.

Early years Paterson was born on the West Side of Buffalo, New York. He is the son of Tony Paterson, an award-winning sculptor who was Professor of Sculpture at the University at Buffalo, and Eleanor Paterson, a painter and bilingual education director at Erie Community College who received her Ph.D. in bilingual education from the University at Buffalo. Although Paterson was surrounded by sculptors and painters while growing up,Schulslaper, Robert, Giving a Voice to American Music: A Conversation with Composer Robert Paterson, Fanfare Magazine, March 28, 2011. his father enjoyed contemporary classical music and took him to new-music concerts at the University at Buffalo, where he heard works by Morton Feldman and John Cage, with both composers in attendance.

He has one brother, David Paterson, who is also a musician and teaches in the New York City public schools. Paterson began composing on his own at age 13 and studied composition privately for two years with William Ortiz-Alvarado from 1984‚Äì86. He also took private percussion lessons at age 12 and attended the Interlochen Center for the Arts for two summers, in 1982 and 1983. He attended the Nichols School in eighth grade and middle school and high school at the Buffalo Academy for Visual and Performing Arts, where he performed in the wind ensemble, jazz band and various choirs, and also played on the tennis team. He also studied percussion with various teachers in the greater Buffalo area, including Lynn Harbold (former principal percussionist with the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra), Jack Brennan (former assistant timpanist with the Buffalo Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, timpanist with the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra), David DePeters (currently percussionist and Executive Director, Iris Orchestra), Anthony Miranda and John Bacon, as well as piano with Claudia Hoca (pianist for the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra) and Edmund Gordanier. While a high school student, Paterson also attended the Boston University Tanglewood Institute for two summers where he studied percussion with members of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, including Arthur Press, Charlie Smith and Tom Gauger, and also performed in the BUTI Orchestra under Eiji Oue and guest conductor Leonard Bernstein. Education Paterson received a Bachelor of Music degree from the Eastman School of Music where he studied with Christopher Rouse, Joseph Schwantner, Samuel Adler, Warren Benson and David Liptak, graduating in 1995. While at Eastman, he was a double major in composition and percussion and studied percussion with John Beck, and also performed in Eastman's Musica Nova ensemble under Sydney Hodkinson and also became a member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia. In 2001 he received a Master of Music degree from the Jacobs School of Music of Indiana University in Bloomington, where he studied composition with Frederick A.

Career After leaving graduate school, Paterson moved to New York City and soon after began teaching at Bronx Community College for one year, and then Sarah Lawrence College for four years. While teaching, Paterson began working on a variety of commissions for ensembles such as Quintet of The Americas, The California EAR Unit and Volti. In 2005, Paterson and his wife Victoria co- founded the American Modern Ensemble and American Modern Recordings, an Independent record label distributed by Naxos of America (a division of Naxos Records) specializing in contemporary classical music, with an emphasis on music by living American composers. Paterson's music has been performed throughout the United States, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia, and his works have been commissioned and/or performed by over one-hundred ensembles, including American Modern Ensemble, both self-produced as well as presented by ChamberMusicNY at Merkin Concert Hall, the Louisville Orchestra, Vermont Symphony Orchestra, Austin Symphony, American Composers Orchestra, Minnesota Orchestra, Quintet of the Americas, Chamber Choir of Europe, Musica Sacra (New York) and the Volti choir of San Francisco.

As a conductor, Paterson has conducted the American Modern Ensemble since it was founded in 2005, and has also conducted the Society for New Music ensemble and Atlantic Music Festival Contemporary Ensemble. As a percussionist, Paterson spent many years developing a six-mallet technique based on the Burton grip. He developed this technique while studying with John Beck at the Eastman School of Music, where he presented the world's first all six-mallet marimba recital. As well as composing his own six-mallet works, he has \\"been instrumental in the commissioning of six-mallet works for solo marimba\\" and has to date, written fourteen works using a six-mallet technique (extended technique) he developed.Jones, Timothy, A Survey of Artists and Literature Employing Extended Multiple Mallets in Keyboard Percussion; Its Evolution, Resulting Techniques and Pedagogical Guide, Doctoral Dissertation, College of Fine Arts, Graduate College, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, August 2003, p. 15. His recording Six Mallet Marimba is the first all six- mallet marimba album ever released, and contains many of Paterson's six-mallet marimba compositions. Paterson performs on a five-octave marimba made by Doug DeMorrow. Paterson's work as a composer and percussionist appear on recordings for American Modern Recordings (AMR), Mode Records, Bridge Records, Centaur Records, Capstone Records, and Riax.

Musical Style Paterson's music is influenced by nature (particularly the classical elements), and many of his works have ecological themes, such as \\"A New Eaarth\\" and \\"Embracing The Wind\\". His works are also inspired by rock and roll (such as \\"Ghost Theater\\" which quotes the John Bonham drumset part from When the Levee Breaks by Led Zeppelin and \\"Hell's Kitchen\\"), jazz (the last movement from \\"Symphony in Three Movements\\" and \\"Thursday\\"), world music (\\"The Book of Goddesses\\")Smith, Ken, The composer's own ensemble in a broadly influenced work, Gramophone, December, 2011.Nugent, Patricia, Digging The Deities, Organic Spa Magazine, November‚ÄìDecember, 2011. Retrieved July 2, 2015. and Indian music (the third movement of \\"Sun Trio\\"). Paterson is also influenced by the music of other classical composers, including Russian composers such as Igor Stravinsky (\\"Sun Trio\\", second movement), Dmitri Shostakovich and Alfred Schnittke, and French composers such as Maurice Ravel, Erik Satie, Claude Debussy and Olivier Messiaen, and American composers such as Aaron Copland, Charles Ives, Steve Reich and many of his former teachers. He has said, \\"...I am essentially interested in unifying all musical elements‚Äîand many non-musical elements (i.e. ‚Äònoise‚Äô) ‚Äî into a cohesive whole.‚Äù Stylistically, although many of Paterson's works are atonal, a large selection of Paterson's works are tonal, combining major and minor scales and modes with chromaticism, Octatonic scales, Blues scales, Tone rows, artificial scales and scales from non-Western cultures, such as his use of the Indonesian Pelog scale in his work \\"Quintus\\". Some of his works derive their material from chromatically saturated harmonic patterns that combine chords, melodies and motivic ideas that complete the chromatic scale within given sections of works. Formally, some of Paterson's works are highly episodic, such as his \\"Sextet\\" and \\"Hell's Kitchen\\", while others are more seamless, such as \\"Dark Mountains\\" for orchestra, \\"A Dream Within A Dream\\" for a cappella choir or \\"Deep Blue Ocean\\" for two pianos. Paterson's music is generally very colorful, and he incorporates extended techniques in many of his works, such as \\"Scorpion Tales\\" for two harps, \\"The Book of Goddesses\\" for flute, harp and percussion, \\"Komodo\\" and \\"Piranha\\" for solo marimba and \\"Eating Variations\\" for baritone and chamber ensemble. He also occasionally uses found objects, such as in his work \\"Hell's Kitchen\\" which calls for kitchen utensils, pots and pans, and even a kitchen sink. Many of his works also use bell sounds, and Paterson has said, \\"I am fascinated with resonance, and how notes ring. I also like bell sounds, and often ask non-percussionists to play cup gongs (temple bowls or Tibetan bowls), finger cymbals and other hand-held percussion instruments\\",Carey, Christian, Robert Paterson: Marimba Plus Six Mallets, Sequenza21, November 13, 2012. Retrieved July 2. 2015. such as \\"The Thin Ice of Your Fragile Mind\\", which calls for many of the performers to use graduated finger cymbals and Tingshas, \\"Eating Variations\\" which calls for specifically- pitched singing bowls, and \\"A New Eaarth,\\" which calls for non-percussionists (such as one of the flute players) to use specifically-tuned wind chimes. Many of Paterson's works are programmatic, such as \\"Electric Lines\\" for orchestra, \\"Crimson Earth\\" for symphonic band and \\"Sextet\\" for chamber ensemble. Themes that have inspired Paterson have included famous icons such as Thomas Edison (for his work \\"Sonata for Bassoon and Piano\\") and Mike PiazzaGreene, Dan. Catchy Tunes: A concert features a tenor's take on Mike Piazza and other sports notes, Sports Illustrated, March 12, 2012. Retrieved July 2, 2015. (in his song cycle \\"Batter's Box\\", formerly titled \\"Stepping Into The Batter's Box, He Hears His Father's Voice\\"), while other works are inspired by famous paintings (\\"Closet Full of Demons\\" for sinfonietta, inspired by The Nightmare by Henry Fuseli, \\"Crimson Earth\\", inspired by The Triumph of Death by Pieter Bruegel the Elder) and the third movement of his \\"Wind Quintet\\", inspired by Salvador Dali's The Persistence of Memory. A few of his works quote the works of other composers, such as his\\" Elegy for Two Bassoons and Piano\\" and \\"Elegy for Two Cellos and Piano\\", the same work with different instrumentation, both of which quote the music of J.S. Bach. His work \\"Looney Tunes\\" quotes Olivier Messiaen and Charlie Parker,Smith, Steve, Composers Explain Whys and Wherefores, The New York Times, March 26, 2013.

In the second movement of Paterson's \\"Wind Quintet, \\"Suburban waltz-fantasy\\", there are quotes from well-known television show themes, including The Jetsons, All in the Family, Green Acres, The Dick Van Dyke Show, The Brady Bunch and Leave It To Beaver. Although many of Paterson's works are serious or at least musically abstract in nature, a selection of his works incorporate humorous elements, such as his chamber vocal song cycles \\"Batter's Box\\" and \\"CAPTCHA\\", and his choral works \\"The Essence of Gravity\\" and \\"Did You Hear.\\" Regarding humor in his own music, Paterson has said, ‚ÄúOf all of the aspects of writing that seem to intrigue people regarding my work, my embracing humor is probably the most contentious: some people like, it, some do not. Many composers admit that they do not care to write ‚Äòfunny‚Äô music. It seems as if they think they are in danger of being considered trivial or not serious if they embrace humor.\\" Paterson has spent a good part of his career composing vocal works. Although he has set numerous poems by poets such as Wallace Stevens and Robert Creeley,da Fonseca-Wollheim, Corinna, Robert Paterson: ‚ÄòWinter Songs and Other Vocal Works‚Äô, The New York Times, December 11, 2013 he has also set a myriad of diverse, alternative texts, such as fictitious answering machine messages (\\"Thursday\\" for soprano and piano), onomatopoeia words (\\"The Essence of Gravity\\" for a cappella choir), and even nursery rhymes (\\"Life is But a Dream\\" for a cappella choir). One of these works, \\"CAPTCHA\\" for baritone and piano, \\"...derives its lyrics from the two- word answers to reCAPTCHA puzzles. The lyrics are a combination of words, numbers and fragments of words and nonsense.\\"Author Unknown, Techman Texts: From passwords to piece of music, Pittsburgh Post Gazette, December 2, 2013. Within his vocal output, one of his primary works is the climate change inspired \\"A New Eaarth\\" for orchestra, chorus and narrator, commissioned by the Vermont Youth Orchestra Association, and inspired by Eaarth by Bill McKibben, who narrated at the premiere. Described by the press as \\"an amazingly colorful tone poem\\", \\"A New Eaarth\\" consists of alternating sections of pure orchestral music, narration, and sections for orchestra and chorus (these excerpted choral movements also exist as a work for a choir and piano entitled \\"Suite from A New Eaarth\\"). The work addresses climate change and is divided into four main sections, each section centered on one of the four classical elements and how they relate to environmental disasters such as flooding, tornadoes, hurricanes and forest fires, all thought to be exacerbated by climate change. The text for this work consists of narrative text by Paterson based on statements and statistics in McKibben's book, as well as poems by Wendell Berry, James Joyce, Percy Bysshe Shelly and William Wordsworth and well-known quotes and aphorisms.

The company toured schools and theatres across East Anglia, especially in its home county of Norfolk. Most of its productions were also toured across the UK to theatres, art-centres and festivals. Tiebreak was run by an administrative team of three, employing freelance actors, writers, composers, designers and other artists to produce theatre productions and workshops for young people and their families. The company also toured internationally to Ireland, Germany and several children's festivals across western Canada and the USA. Tiebreak received commissions from such prestigious agencies as the Natural History Museum, Forest Enterprise and The National Trust. The company was known for its innovative approach to a wide range of work including live music theatre, new writing commissions, participatory projects and issue-based plays. Writers included Kay Adshead, Leslie Davidoff and Neil Duffield. Most of the company's last productions were written by Artistic Director David Farmer, who left to pursue a freelance career in writing, teaching and directing.

It was discovered in 2007 by Dutch schoolteacher Hanny van Arkel while she was participating as a volunteer in the Galaxy Zoo project, part of the Zooniverse group of citizen science websites. Photographically, it appears as a bright blob close to spiral galaxy IC 2497 in the constellation Leo Minor. Description Hanny's Voorwerp (HsV) is about the size of a small galaxy and has a central hole over 16,000 light years across. In an image taken with the HST, HsV is colored green, a standard false color that is used to represent the presence of several luminous emission lines of glowing oxygen. HsV has been shown to be at the same distance from Earth as the adjacent galaxy IC 2497, which is about 650 million light-years away. Star birth is occurring in the region of HsV that faces IC 2497. Radio observations indicate that this is due to an outflow of gas arising from the IC 2497's core which is interacting with a small region of HsV to collapse and form stars. The youngest of these stars are several million years old. A 40-page comic and associated promotional offers about HsV and the story surrounding it were presented at the 24th Dragon Con in Atlanta on 3 September 2010, as well as first pictures of HsV from the Hubble Space Telescope. The launch was streamed live on UStream. Hypotheses HST zooms in on a space oddity350px One hypothesis suggests that HsV consists of remnants of a small galaxy showing the impact of radiation from a bright quasar event that occurred in the center of IC 2497 about 100,000 years before how it is observed today. The quasar event is thought to have stimulated the bright emission that characterizes HsV. The quasar might have switched off in the last 200,000 years and is not visible in the available images. This might well be due to a process known as AGN feedback. One possible explanation for the missing light-source is that illumination from the assumed quasar was a transient phenomenon. In this case, its effects on HsV would be still visible because of the distance of several tens of thousands of light years between HsV and the quasar in the nearby galaxy: HsV would show a \\"light echo\\" or \\"ghost image\\" of events that are older than those currently seen in the galaxy. On 17 June 2010, a group of researchers at the European VLBI Network (EVN) and the UK‚Äôs Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN), proposed another related explanation. They hypothesized that the light comes from two sources: (1) a supermassive black hole at the center of IC 2497, and (2) light produced by an interaction of an energetic jet from the black hole and the gas surrounding IC 2497. Voorwerpjes A Hubble Space Telescope combined image of eight quasar ionisation echoes, or Voorwerpjes. CREDITS: NASA, ESA and Prof. William Keel In February 2012, W. C. Keel and others published a paper in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. As a result of the interest in similar ionized clouds for the study of both the history and obscuration of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), participants in the Galaxy Zoo (GZ) project carried out a wide search for such clouds using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This search yielded a list of 19 galaxies with AGN-photoionized clouds detected to beyond 10 kiloparsecs from the nuclei. These were nicknamed 'Voorwerpjes' from the Dutch for 'small objects'. In August 2013, F. Schweizer and others published a paper in the Astrophysical Journal. This reports the finding of a Voorwerpje on the outskirts of the well-studied NGC 7252. In May 2015, W.C. Keel and others published a study in the Astrophysical Journal. This studies 8 of the original 19 Voorwerpjes in greater detail, focusing on 'the host-galaxy properties and origin of the gas.' Among the telescopes used was the 6 meter BTA-6 at the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Science. In February 2018, Treister et al. studied the galaxy Mrk 463 with VLT/MUSE, VLT/Sinfoni and ALMA. This study found extended emissions around this galaxy and that the supermassive black hole accretion rate, on the Mrk 463E nucleus changed by a factor 3‚Äì20 in the last 40,000 years. Similar to other Voorwerpje galaxies. Galaxy zoo volunteers did identify this galaxy as a candidate Voorwerpje, but the [O III] emission was already described by earlier studies. In March 2018, Lansbury et al. studied the Teacup Galaxy, also known as the Teacup AGN or SDSS J1430+1339 in x-rays with Swift and Chandra. The extended clouds around the Teacup AGN consist out of a \\"eastern bubble\\", seen in optical images and a \\"western bubble\\", only seen in radio images by the Very Large Array. The Chandra observations revealed a loop in x-ray emission, consistent with the \\"eastern bubble\\". The Chandra data also show evidence for hotter gas within the bubble, which may imply that a wind of material is blowing away from the black hole. Such a wind, which was driven by radiation from the quasar, may have created the bubbles found in the Teacup. The observations in x-rays revealed a powerful, highly obscured active galactic nucleus. This new result suggests that the AGN might not require fading. The quasar has dimmed by only a factor of 25 or less over the past 100,000 years. In March 2019, Keel et al. studied AGN photoionization of gas in galaxy pairs. The study found UGC 6081 as a candidate Voorwerpje, using data from the 2.5-meter telescope of the Caucasus Mountain Observatory. The emission extends 18 kpc from both AGN. Extended X-ray emission in IC 2497 In April 2016, a study was published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society using data gathered by the Chandra X-ray Observatory in January 2012. The study found extended soft X-ray emission in IC 2497 which suggested the presence of a bubble or cavity surrounding the AGN. The authors hypothesize that this could be due to the bubble being inflated by the AGN, or by a past luminous quasar.

It has an area of and had approximately 379,500 inhabitants as of 2010. It is home to Mount Lao, which gave the district its name. Geography Laoshan District is located in the south of the Shandong Peninsula, facing the Yellow Sea in the east and south. It covers with of coastline. The mountain ranges of Laoshan cover most of the eastern part of the district. The district belongs to north temperature zone, with a monsoon-influenced temperate climate. There is neither intense heat in summer nor severe cold in winter. Most of the district is highland with the average altitude of 55m and surface water of 3m. There is abundant high quality ground water. In fact, Laoshan mineral water is renowned and sold China-wide. Natural resources are abundant, with granite being the prevalent mineral in the area. Economy Laoshan District is home to several Hi-tech industries, tourism and a large service-based industry. In terms of Hi-Tech, the focus is laid on IT, Software, Marine Biological Pharmacy and new materials. Emphasis has been put on sustainable development and green technology, taking advantage of the still-intact mountain forests and the seaside. The Qingdao International Convention And Exhibition Center (QICC) with an area of 250,000 m2 is currently remains the largest venue for exhibition and convention purposes in Shandong province. It was put into use in April, 2001 and ever since has marked a rapid development phase of Qingdao exhibition and convention economy. Tourism Tourism is also essential to the district, with a wide variety of recreational, ecological, seaside sight- seeing tourism facilities including the Polar Ocean World and Shilaoren Sightseeing Garden. The district is home to several well-known festivals, including the Qingdao International Beer Festival, Laoshan Tea Festival and Laoshan Tourism Culture Festival, all of which attract visitor from China as well as abroad. The main tourist attraction within the district is Mount Lao itself, which is a 5A tourist destination. with about 176,000 tourists visiting during the 2012 Golden Week. Other tourist destinations include the Qingdao Museum (), Haier Museum (), Qingdao Grand Theatre () and the Beach at Old Stone Man (). Laoshan tea Laoshan is well known for its famous green tea. It has a unique character gained as a result of being grown at a higher latitude than any other tea within China. The high latitude makes it all the more difficult for the tea plants to grow which gives the tea a full and complex taste. Education Laoshan District is home to over 65 schools and institutions of higher education. It is host to three major universities, most notably the main campus of both the Ocean University of China and the Qingdao University of Science and Technology, as well as a branch campus of Qingdao University.

The museum logo is W&F.;Wisbech & Fenland Museum, Culture24, UK. Listing on Cornucopia, URL accessed 25 June 2008.  History   19th century  The Museum Society was founded in 1835 and was originally located in two rooms of 16 Old Market Place, a detached part of the house of George Snarey and opened in July. The collections could be seen 'from 11 to 2 o'clock every Friday'. In 1839 admission was 1s. Wisbech Institute were given permission to bring members for a tour at 6d per member. In 1845 the museum building was sold and it re-located to the present purpose-built building in 1847. Originally designed to house both the Museum (founded in 1835) and Literary Society (founded in 1781), the latter ceased in 1877 and the Museum trustees became the sole owners.http://www.wisbech-society.co.uk/museum.html The Wisbech Society & Preservation Trust, Wisbech & Fenland Museum A Grade II* listed building, designed by architect George Buckler, and opened in 1847, the museum retains its original display cases and bookcases. The building suffers from subsidence, due mainly to its location. Having been sited over the location of the former moat to the Wisbech Castle, settlement of the infill has resulted in movement to the front elevation of the building closest to St Peter's Church. In 1887 the library was extended. The museum houses a number of important collections relating to local history and the anti-slavery campaigner Thomas Clarkson. A significant exhibit is the original manuscript of Charles Dickens' Great Expectations, the bequest of Chauncy Hare Townshend.Wisbech and Fenland Museum, Stride Guides. Other notable artefacts include reputedly Napoleon's S√®vres breakfast service, said to have been captured at the Battle of Waterloo and Thomas Clarkson's chest, containing examples of 18th century African textiles, seeds and leatherwork which he used to illustrate his case for direct trade with Africa.  20th century  The museum holds an extensive collection of maps and these were exhibited in Cambridge in 1934, Peckover House in 1954 & 1976 and in the museum in 1993.  21st century  In May and June 2018 an archaeological dig was carried out by Archaeological Project Services (APS) as part of The Wisbech High Street project in the museum grounds. Members of FenArch and the public took part in this community dig.  Local and Social History  The W&F; collection includes agricultural implements, drainage tools and pipes, shooting and fishing equipment and as such reflect the culture and economy of the Fens up until modern mechanisation deleoped in the 20th century. In addition, the history of Borough and port is represented by collections which include a shipping industry display - the port authority is now the Fenland District Council, the town was a major port for grain and wood, slates, coal and stone was imported to serve the area's needs. Crime and punishment items used locally are on display. The town once had a gaol, pillory, stocks and gibbet. A mantrap once belonging to the Peckover House and Garden is on display in the museum. 19th and early 20th century life is illustrated through the collection of domestic objects and others relating to local trades. The museum exhibits include bill posters for the town's Georgian Angles Theatre, one of the country's oldest purpose-built theatres. A model of a woad mill at Parson Drove and associated items are on display. Woad growing industry was mostly confined to the Cambridgeshire and Lincolnshire Fens. A display of items linked to the Cambridgeshire Regiment is found in the uppermost gallery.  Natural History  W&F; has a vast collection of local, British and international geology (rocks & minerals), paleontology (fossils), conchology (shells), 19th century bird, mammal and fish mounts, lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), coleoptera (beetles) and a herbarium (botanical specimens). Among the fossils to be seen are ichthyosaurs, belemnites, sea urchins and sharks teeth.  Archaeology  The extensive archaeology collection of the W&F; enables visitors to understand the development of Fenland life from the pre- historic through medieval times to the recent past. W&F;'s Romano- British collection features fine examples of pottery as well as a skeleton of c.1700-year-old woman from Coldham. The jewel of the Museum's Celtic material is a highly decorated Iron Age Wisbech Scabbard (c.300 BC), found locally by Samuel Smith (photographer). Pottery and other artefacts recovered in the soils of the Welle Stream (an extinct Fenland river) give an insight into the life in the Iron Age, Roman and Medieaval Periods. W&F; acquires finds from digs in the area, it recently received some of the collection of the 2009 Dig in the Wisbech Castle. W&F; also worked with the Wisbech High Street project and Fenland Archaeological Society to carry out a community dig on the museum's grounds and loaned items for a temporary exhibition and open day at Wisbech castle in 2019.  Ancient Egyptian  W&F; houses a Victorian collection of artefacts which illustrate much about the Egyptian lives and beliefs. A dis-membered mummified hand is mounted on a red velvet cushion. Other items include a mummified cat, idolets of Osiris, Isis and Horus and Canopic jars and several stelae (gravestones). W&F; has an Egyptian handling collection which is very popular with school parties and groups of other visitors.  Photography  The W&F; collection includes 19th century photographs of Wisbech and surrounding area by Samuel Smith (photographer); topographical images of East Anglia taken by Herbert Coates in the 1920s, Wisbech building and street scenes photographed by Geoff Hastings in the 1950s and 1960s and photographs in the 1970s by George Annis. It also has some of the earliest examples of photographs of Madagascar taken in the 1850s by William Ellis (1794-1872), a prominent member of the London Missionary Society.  Public access  Admission is free to the W&F; for all visitors. The museum is open 10am - 4pm Tuesday to Saturday. It is sometimes open on some Bank Holidays but usually closed on Sundays. The W&F; is an important venue for widening interest in Wisbech and Fenland and regularly participates in Fenland-wide events and Twilight at the Museums. It puts on activities for families and individuals as well as temporary exhibitions, workshops and other events. During January and early February the museum is only open on Saturdays. The museum was upgraded to include a lift to access different levels and a rear access for wheelchair users and those visitors unable to enter by the main entrance on Museum Square. The rear access is via Wilderness Walk (off Market Street). The communication system enables reception to allow access.  Museum Library  The W&F; has a reference library of c.12,000 volumes. Non-fiction works of History, Biography, Medicine, Travel and Exploration comprise the bulk of the collection with less Fiction and Drama, and Theological and Political works are uncommon. Friends of Wisbech and Fenland Museum The Friends of Wisbech and Fenland Museum raise funds for the museum and publish books on local history. The Trade of a Farmer: John Peck of Parson Drove by Dian Blawer was published in 2000. In 2019 a series of books of photos by Geoff Hastings were published; the first print run of 100 copies of Photos of Wisbech no.1 sold out in a week and was reprinted the same month. Photos of Wisbech no.2 followed in December. Images of Wisbech no.3 was launched in February 2020 to coincide with an illustrated talk by writer William P.Smith.  Funding  The museum operates a free admission policy and relies to a large degree on volunteer support with income from a combination of sponsorship, donations, museum shop sales and grants. Since the Fenland District Council withdrew grant support, the Wisbech Town Council grant and a recent 'Re-founders' scheme (¬£1k pa for five years) and grants from the 'Friends' and other organisations have been important sources of funds. More recently a 'Supporters Circle' scheme using monthly Direct Debits of ¬£5 Clarkson, ¬£10 Peckover or ¬£20 Townsend has been launched by the museum. A planned coffee shop, may if approved become another income stream.

Paragrammatism is the inability to form grammatically correct sentences. It is characteristic of fluent aphasia, most commonly receptive aphasia. Paragrammatism is sometimes called \\"extended paraphasia,\\" although it is different from paraphasia. Paragrammatism is roughly synonymous with \\"word salad,\\" which concerns the semantic coherence of speech rather than its production. Cause Huber assumes a disturbance of the sequential organization of sentences as the cause of the syntactic errors (1981:3). Most students and practitioners regard paragrammatism as the morphosyntactic \\"leitsymptom\\" of Wernicke's aphasia. However, ever since the introduction of the term paragrammatism some students have pointed out that paragrammatic and agrammatic phenomena, which in classical theory form part of Broca's aphasia, may co-occur in the same patient. History Since Kleist introduced the term in 1916, paragrammatism has denoted a disordered mode of expression that is characterized by confused and erroneous word order, syntactic structure or grammatical morphology (Schlenck 1991:199f) Most researchers suppose that the faulty syntactic structure (sentence blends, contaminations, break-offs) results from a disturbance of the syntactic plan of the utterance (de Bleser/Bayer 1993:160f) In non-fluent aphasia, oral expression is often agrammatic, i.e. grammatically incomplete or incorrect. By contrast, expression in fluent aphasia usually appears grammatical, albeit with disruptions in content. Despite this persistent impression, errors of sentence structure and morphology do occur in fluent aphasia, although they take the form of substitutions rather than omissions.
