The blog, which further covered ongoing intra-party operations, political issues and scandals, was started in June 2005 by Democratic consultant Mark Nickolas, former campaign manager for both Speaker of the Kentucky House Jody Richards and U.S. House Rep. Ben Chandler's 2003 gubernatorial campaign . The blog, edited solely by Nickolas for most of its active period, described itself as \\"An Unfiltered and Candid Look at Politics, Politicians and the Media in Kentucky\\". The chief recipient of the blog's criticism was Governor Fletcher. Fletcher and many of his subordinates were indicted as part of the state's 2005‚Äì2006 merit system investigation, and this, in addition to other controversies surrounding the Fletcher administration, had become the focus of a large number of posts. Other major targets were Kentucky Supreme Court Chief Justice Joseph Lambert, Republican Senate President David L. Williams and former Kentucky Democratic Party chairman Jerry Lundergan. On May 24, 2007, Nickolas announced on the blog that he would be moving with his girlfriend to Montana, her home state, at the end of the month. Nickolas continued blogging up until a week before he closed the blog permanently on July 2. In Montana, Nickolas started a new blog called Rocky Mountain Report. After an infusion of financial support, BluegrassReport.org was revived on August 6, 2007 to continue running at least through the 2007 Fall statewide campaigns in Kentucky. According to the Internet Archive, the last post on the blog occurred on August 19, 2008 and the website was shut down sometime in 2009. Controversy and legal issues In June 2006, the blog became the focus of a controversy involving a state government clampdown on the access of particular genres of websites, including political blogs, where BluegrassReport.org amongst a range of blogs was blocked, while some blogs remained accessible, leaving a widely reported impression that the blocks were selective and perhaps political in nature. On July 10, 2006, Public Citizen filed a lawsuit on behalf of Nickolas challenging the constitutionality of the state government's blocking actions. On January 17, 2007, Nickolas was indicted on charges of willfully failing to file any state income tax returns for 2003, 2004 or 2005. The Courier-Journal reported that Nickolas told the paper he paid his state income taxes in full for those years in December 2006, after the state Revenue Cabinet informed him that he was under investigation. The Lexington Herald-Leader reported that Nickolas paid those taxes with checks from an account in the name of the nonprofit foundation through which he runs his blog. The case against Nickolas was dropped on May 18, 2007. Awards BluegrassReport.org tied with Tennessee Guerilla Women to win the 2005 Koufax Award for \\"Best State or Local Blog\\".

The population of Coalmont is roughly 100 full-time residents. It is near the community of Tulameen and Otter Lake and the Coldwater Junction of the Coquihalla Highway. The town was established in 1912 to serve as a supply point to the neighbouring coal mine at Blakeburn. History Coal was first discovered in the area as early as 1858; a fully exposed vein that reportedly could be lit by a match. When Columbia Coal and Coke moved their offices from Granite Creek to Upper Town in 1911, they gave Coalmont its name. The area just west of Coalmont, formerly referred to as \\"Cardiff\\", became \\"Upper Town\\", the location for the mining office, shipping terminal, power plant, company stables, school and workers' residences. \\"Coalmont\\" was the location for stores, hotels and other businesses, and residences. The lumber to build the necessary buildings came from their sawmill in nearby Tulameen. The original minesite was on the hillside overlooking the south side of the Tulameen River, a bit west of Coalmont, and part of the wooden abutment for the Upper Town Bridge still survives on the south shore of the Tulameen River, about a kilometre upstream of the present bridge. They were attempting to mine the coal from underneath, but the ground proved unstable, and the coal seams fractured. Coalmont Collieries took over the operation in 1913, and began mining higher on the mountain, accessing the coal from above, but production and all development in the town stopped when War broke out in 1914. After the War, owners Blake Wilson and Pat Burns reorganized the company, and resumed operations. When the three-mile-long aerial tramway was built to carry the coal from the Blakeburn minesite down to Coalmont, production increased from about 10,000 tons a year to over 100,000 and it eventually peaked at 167,461 tons in 1928. The tramway operated by gravity, the full hoppers of coal moving down providing the energy to take the empty buckets back up, and it could transport a ton of coal a minute. The Kettle Valley Railway, part of the C.P.R., originally purchased the coal for their steam engines, but quickly discovered that it burned too hot and warped the firebox grates, a similar problem to that experienced by the locals when used in their stoves. Stove lids and grates were big sellers in the local stores! The old KVR railbed (sans rails) is now part of the well- maintained Trans Canada Trail. The older buildings in Coalmont, like the hotel, meat market, general store, livery stable, and the office section of the Mozey-On-Inn, date to 1911‚Äì1912, when the town was established. The Mozey- On-Inn Office had a twin which was the post office from 1948 to 1950, and was destroyed by fire in the 1960s. Both buildings were located on the west side of Parrish Ave. between Main St. and Front St. The Mozey-On-Inn Office, which was the post office in 1951‚Äì1952, survived and was moved diagonally across the intersection of Main & Parrish during the 1970s. The post office moved into the general store in 1952, and Walt Smart took over as postmaster. Walt Smart ran the general store from 1946 to 1971, and later the Coalmont Emporium, which he built directly across the street, where the old twin post offices once sat. His father, James, was the postmaster from 1942 to 1950, and his grandfather, W.H. Holmes, was a placer miner at Granite Creek during the Gold Rush days. Railway The railway arrived in Coalmont in November 1911, and although it was officially known as the Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railway, the line to all practical purposes was a regular Great Northern Railway branch line, as they had purchased the VV&E; charter to build through Canadian territory. The Kettle Valley Railway took over operation of the line in 1915, and in 1944 the Canadian Pacific Railway purchased the Princeton- Brookmere line outright. The Train Station and Water Tower (which were both standard GNR designs) were located to the south side of the KVR tracks, just west of Parrish Ave., in the vacant field to the right as one turns into town from Princeton. If you proceed west on Main St., out of town towards Tulameen, on your left you will see a large concrete pillar, which was the lower anchor point for the tramway. The \\"Tipple\\", or lower terminal for the tramway, was a large, three-story building, and once surrounded this structure. There are some other ruins in the area, notably the old power house, now just a foundation, and everywhere you look you can see pieces of the steel cable from the tramway, embedded in the spilled coal which litters the area. If you look at the larger pieces of coal, you will often find veins of clear yellow amber running through it, and green amber (resinite) has also been found. There are also large piles of \\"clinkers\\" which is fused coal ash from the power house. Looking north, across the highway, there are still two buildings standing that were part of \\"Upper Town\\". Just across the KVR right of way is a house, still in use, on the east side of the highway, and further to the east of it is the derelict remains of the last of the \\"Seven Sisters\\", a row of seven identical buildings that housed some of the workers. Modern Coalmont Coalmont had its ups and downs over the years, largely due to the mining operation which shut in 1940. Coalmont was also a junction on the Kettle Valley Railway, whose roadbed is now the Trans-Canada Trail. The Coalmont Hotel recently celebrated its 100th anniversary (2012) and its bar is once again open for business (2014). Update ‚Äì As of the summer of 2015, the bar has once again been closed. Recently, coal mining (Coalmont Energy Corp.) started up again, after years of Coalmont being a lumbering and summer cabin area. (As of late 2013, the Coalmont Energy mine shut down soon after a settling pond breached its bank.)

Bride service and bride wealth models frame anthropological discussions of kinship in many regions of the world.   Patterns Patterns of matrilocal post-marital residence, as well as the practice of temporary or prolonged bride service, have been widely reported for indigenous peoples of the Amazon basin.  * Among these people, bride service is frequently performed in conjunction with an interval of uxorilocal residence. The length of uxorilocal residence and the duration of bride service are contingent upon negotiations between the concerned parties, the outcome of which has been characterized as an enduring commitment or permanent debt. The power wielded by those who ‚Äúgive‚Äù wives over those who ‚Äútake‚Äù them is also said to be a significant part of the political relationships in societies where bride service obligations are prevalent. Rather than seeing affinity in terms of a \\"compensation\\" model whereby individuals are exchanged as objects, Dean‚Äôs (1995) research on Amazon bride service among the Urarina demonstrates how differentially situated subjects negotiate the politics of marriage. Example An example of bride service occurs in the Hebrew Bible, , when Jacob labored for Laban for fourteen years to marry Rachel. Originally the deal was seven years, but Laban tricked Jacob by giving him Leah on their wedding day, so Jacob had to work another seven years to obtain the girl he had originally fallen in love with, Rachel.

It sits at the confluence of a creek that runs through an unusually beautiful small valley and that feeds into the Delaware Division of the Pennsylvania Canal, an old barge canal formerly used for transporting coal and cement from Northern Pennsylvania to Philadelphia. The canal is now the Delaware Canal State Park. Although it is tiny, it previously had several mills along the creek including one that milled railroad ties and it also had two quarries along the canal. Cuttalosa had been the site of a ferry across the Delaware River. Later one of the stone quarries operated a cable tram to convey rock across the river to the railroad on the New Jersey side of the river. The hamlet is also identified as Lumberton, although it was commonly called Cuttalossa after the creek that runs through it. In the past, the community had bourne the name of several of the operators of the ferry (Roses Ferry, Thorne's Ferry, Warner's Ferry, and Painter's Ferry). From 1819 until 1833 it was named Hard Times after a long standing tavern. For many years, the tavern has been a private residence and ironically, the principal mill has been a fine restaurant and bar. Perhaps the most famous resident of the hamlet was Col. Zebulon Pike of Pike's Peak fame who spent his childhood there.\\"Solebury Township Bucks County Pennsylvania, a Short History of the Township and a Report on Township Officers and Affairs\\", by John Richardson, Offset Service Company, Philaldelphia, 1958. Note that this may complement or may contradict sources saying that he was born in Lamberton, NJ. Cuttalossa was also home to the artists Daniel Garber and William F. Taylor. Taylor also founded the Cuttaloosa Inn and during the late 1940s and early 1950s was one of the prime movers and shakers in saving the old barge canal and having it restored and refilled.

It is a loose, ricotta-like cheese used to make cheese spreads. A mild, unsalty ricotta can be substituted. This variety is most often sold in the markets wrapped in fresh corn husks. In El Salvador, cheeses such as reques√≥n can sometimes be transported wrapped in banana leaves instead. The Portuguese product https://tradicional.dgadr.gov.pt/pt/cat/queijos-e-produtos- lacteos/586-requeijao-serra-da-estrela-dop is white to yellowish-white, solid, and usually having a characteristic strong taste; typically sold in specially designed draining plastic or basket-like weaved containers, or in plastic cups. The Brazilian product is a type of cream cheese white in color (but not similar to the American notion of cream cheese, and may be better understood as \\"creamy cheese\\"). It has a mild taste and its consistency can vary from creamy solid, like the Catupiry, to liquid. Traditionally associated with the state of Minas Gerais, the mineiro presence in Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo from the start of the 20th century on popularized it and nowadays it is produced all over the country. Its most common variant is requeij√£o cremoso, with a consistency similar to that of condensed milk; usually sold in glass or plastic cups, both generally re-employed by Brazilians as regular cups. Romeu- e-Julieta is a dessert that combines white cheese and guava paste. It usually calls for queijo minas, requeij√£o or ricotta, with requeij√£o generally being the one used in Brazilian-adapted pizzas, cr√™pes, waffles, pancake rolls and spring rolls.  Manufacturing  Skim milk is held until lactic acid bacteria acidify and coagulate its proteins. The curdled milk is stirred and heated to a temperature as high as 80 ¬∞C (175 ¬∞F), then the whey is drained off and the curd is gathered in bags and pressed. The curd is placed in flat pans, broken up, and washed with warm skim milk, to form a mixture consisting of two parts milk to one part curd. This mixture is stirred and heated, as before, until the casein in the milk curdles and adheres to the mass of curd. The steps of draining, pressing, adding more skim milk, and heating are repeated once more. The curd is drained again, salted (2 to 2.5% by weight) and kneaded on a table for about 15 minutes. Hot butterfat or rich cream is added, about one part of butterfat for every five parts of curd, and the mixture is once again heated and stirred. The cheese is then molded in parchment-lined boxes. About 11 kg of cheese is obtained from 100 kg of skim milk and 3.4 kg of cream. Composition varies, but a typical cheese can contain 55-70% water, 8-20% fat, and 16-20.5% protein.

The third book in the trilogy is Shadow of the Flame. Plot introduction The setting is in Taladas, although it's generally in the jungles of Neron and the Imperial League. Plot summary Shedara, Forlo, and Hult, prepare to leave Coldhope Keep, but are attacked by shadow-fiends. The shadow-fiends outnumber them, and are losing as well as badly injured. Luckily, Eldako shows up and manages to kill the rest of the shadow-fiends. They decide to stay in Coldhope Keep until they recover. Later, the Fourth Legion of the Imperial League arrives, intent on arresting Forlo for desertion. Forlo claims he didn't desert, but they are still determined to arrest. Eldako and Shedara manage to escape via a magic levitation spell, by jumping down a cliff. However, Hult is afraid of magic, so he didn't manage to escape. Forlo didn't want the Fourth Legion to capture just Hult, as they would torture him since they wouldn't get himself, so he stayed with Hult and was arrested too. Hult and Forlo are taken back to the capital, Kristophan, and since Eldako and Shedara can't overpower so many minotaurs, they travel back to Armach-nesti to see if they can get help. At the same time, Essana is in the jungles of Neron, and held captive by the Brethren who are trying to resurrect Maladar. The faces of the Brethren are scarred, and hidden behind hoods, just like Maladar. They want to resurrect Maladar because they believe that Taladas is declining due to war, famine, etc., and that Maladar will reestablish the empire of Aurim, bringing peace and prosperity. There are six of the Faceless Brethren; the Keeper, the Master, the Teacher, the Slayer, the Watcher, and the Speaker. She later learns that the Keeper is secretly a spy for the kings of the Rainward Isles. She is forced to watch them sacrifice elves of the jungle to Maladar. Meanwhile, the scenario in Armach-nesti is even worse. Thousands of shadow- fiends have invaded the woods, and the elves are hard-pressed to keep them back. The city has been overrun, and it's basically a melee. She discovers that her brother only has sixty elves total in his force, but he still manages to spare some to help rescue Forlo and Hult. Since Forlo \\"deserted\\", he's brought to Rekhaz, who is now the Emperor of the Imperial League. Rekhaz has no pity for Forlo, and declares his life forfeit. Forlo manages to call on his Imperial right of dueling in the arena, and so he and Hult are sent to fight a horax, and begin to lose soon after. Shedara, Eldako, and the elves of Armach- nesti manage to sneak into Kristophan, rescue Forlo and Hult, and escape. Forlo kills Rekhaz in cold blood on the streets of Armach-nesti. The elves of Armach-nesti gives Hult a magical pendant of language, so that he can understand what other people are saying. Now reunited, they head north to the snowy fields of Panak, where they search for the Wyrm-Namer, a dragon that can name other dragons. They arrive in Panak on a magical elven boat, and quickly meet the Wolf-clan, a friendly clan that Eldako has lived with before. On their way to the clan village, they are beset by a snow storm, and pursued by the Eyes, which are almost invulnerable evil creatures that kill any that venture into the snow storms. However, they can be held at bay by statues of the Patient Folk. They arrive at the Wolf-clan's village, and meet the seer, Tulukaruk. Tulukaruk lets a spirit-wolf take control of his body to communicate with them. They learn that the spirit-wolf will only tell them where and how to find the Wyrm-Namer only if they will agree to kill it when they're done. Forced with no choice, they agree. Angusuk, the lead hunter of the tribe leads them to the mountain of the Wyrm-Namer, where Hult uses his magical pendant to communicate with the snow-ogres that guard his lair. They entire the Namer's lair, and discover that he's dying. Before he dies, he manages to tell them the name of the dragon, Gloomwing, who lives in the valleys of Marak, home of the kender. They head back to the village and discover that the shadow-fiends had massacred everyone there, and toppled the statues of the Patient Folk. They notice that some hunters may have escaped, so Angusuk decides to stay and look for the rest of his tribe. Shedara, Hult, Eldako, and Forlo head for Marak. Essana and the Keeper attempt to escape through a tunnel, and Essana begins to miscarriage in the tunnel. They manage to exit the tunnel and get to the rendezvous point with the elves, although they are ambushed. Essana faints, and when she wakes up she discovers that she is chained. The Master shows her what happened to the Keeper, he's mutilated, and is being kept alive by a magic spell. Meanwhile, the four arrive in Marak, and discover that Gloomwing left, though the kender are nearing extinction because the shadow-fiends capture kender, and take them to the Teacher, who arrives when the black moon is full to turn them into more shadow-fiends. Luckily (or unluckily), the black moon was full that night, so they attempt to ambush the Teacher. They capture him, and question him. After that, they desire revenge, so they kill him. After that, they sail to Neron, and as soon as they arrive, Gloomwing decides to \\"meet\\" them. The four notice that the elves were gathering in the woods preparing to ambush Gloomwing, so Eldako decides to be a \\"dummy\\" for Gloomwing. Gloomwing dives at Eldako and breathes acid at him, and at the last second Eldako falls into the water. The elves meanwhile kill Gloomwing. They search for Eldako until it is dark, and are forced to leave and head for the elven village because mind flayers patrol the woods after dark. They meet the oldest elf in the village, the Grandmother. Grandmother tells them that a prophecy foretold that two humans and two elves would destroy the Brethren. She notices that they are missing Eldako, so she scries for him. They find out that the mind flayers captured Eldako, and that he was badly hurt by the dragon's acid. Eldako's right eye was gone, and his vision in his left eye is cloudy. His skin was melted by the acid, and his right leg was the only part of him untouched by the acid. They rescue him, and they assault the temple of Maladar. They manage to kill the Brethren, and Eldako manages to kill the Master by jumping to his death with the Master. They rescue Essana and Azar, Essana's son, who is already eighteen due to age altering magic. However, instead of Maladar taking over Azar, he accidentally manages to take control of Forlo, and he escapes to the Burning Sea where he will try to resurrect Aurim.

It provides a method to allow libraries to directly bind symbols to other libraries, rather than weakly bind to them and leave the dynamic linker to figure out which library contains the symbol.  Theory  When linking a shared library or dynamic linked executable, the linker normally populates the symbol table for that library with all required symbols. It adds symbols in the current object with their offset, and leaves undefined symbols in the object unresolved. Unresolved symbols must still be known at link time, but the linker is passed shared libraries to link with and, when it finds a symbol in another library, it places a note in the output library indicating that it depends on these other shared libraries. This kind of weak linking forces the dynamic linker to resolve which library contains which symbol when the executable is run. The dynamic linker on Linux, for example, reads through the DT_NEEDED section of an ELF object and loads needed libraries; but isn't told where required symbols are. For this, it must iterate through each unresolved symbol in the object, and for each of these, iterate through each loaded library, checking until it finds a matching symbol. This can be time consuming. Direct linking works around this problem by storing an equivalent list of pointers to DT_NEEDED entries in a separate ELF section. Each pointer corresponds to a symbol in the object; thus, these pointers create a relation between a symbol and a DT_NEEDED entry. This allows the linker to locate the library specified by a particular DT_NEEDED entry and check only its symbol table for each symbol, rather than iterate through potentially every library for every symbol.

It is centred around Forest Lake Road, which is used by around 10,000 vehicles a day. For quite a long time there was swamp in a large part and this has now been drained but Lake Rotokaeo remains and the ground remains quite damp in parts. Forest Lake is named after the forest that once surrounded Rotokaeo.  History  Until the 1863 invasion of the Waikato, the area lay between the pƒÅs of Mangaharakeke and Kirikiriroa on the lands of NgƒÅti Wairere. After confiscation, farms were established on from Lake Rotoroa to Forest Lake Rd, owned by Thomas Jolly, and , to the north, owned by John Carey, a doctor with the 4th Waikato Regiment. The first housing was the Laurenson Settlement, on Forest Lake Road, near Walsh Street, built for workers between 1914 and 1921, under the Workers Dwellings Act 1910. The 1927 Hamilton map showed that most of Forest Lake had by then been built on an area north of Waitawhiriwhiri Stream in what had been Pukete Parish when the 1913 map was drawn. Demographics Forest Lake (Hamilton City) had a population of 2,487 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 198 people (8.7%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 357 people (16.8%) since the 2006 census. There were 981 households. There were 1,155 males and 1,332 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.87 males per female. The median age was 36.3 years, with 516 people (20.7%) aged under 15 years, 492 (19.8%) aged 15 to 29, 990 (39.8%) aged 30 to 64, and 489 (19.7%) aged 65 or older. Ethnicities were 73.7% European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 22.4% MƒÅori, 4.7% Pacific peoples, 11.1% Asian, and 2.8% other ethnicities (totals add to more than 100% since people could identify with multiple ethnicities). The proportion of people born overseas was 19.7%, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 46.8% had no religion, 38.6% were Christian, 2.8% were Hindu, 1.4% were Muslim, 0.8% were Buddhist and 3.5% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 417 (21.2%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 357 (18.1%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $31,500. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 984 (49.9%) people were employed full-time, 216 (11.0%) were part-time, and 81 (4.1%) were unemployed.

The Model Engineers Club moved to the park in 1983 and now has of miniature railway track, a 1953 diesel shunter and the former Frankton signalbox. The playground was modernised in 2015. A cycleway is planned to link the playground with Nawton. = Rotokaeo Lake = The MƒÅori language-name translates as Lake () of freshwater mussels (). It also provided other food, such as , and (eels), and plants such as , and flax. Electro- fishing in 2009 found catfish, goldfish and mosquitofish, as well as eels. The lake is supertrophic, sometimes resulting in algal blooms. An outlet weir keeps water at a maximum depth of . The catchment is about , mainly stormwater from neighbouring streets. Rotokaeo now covers , but once extended south into the area of the netball courts and BMX track, which was filled in for a rugby ground and then a stock car track. Before urbanisation the lake probably also had a larger area of peat bog. Before 2007 Mexican water lilies covered 86% of the lake, attracting many wading birds, but, after weed control, a 2008 survey found mallard, pukeko, coot, black shag, little black shag, little shag, black swan, Canada goose, Japanese snipe and dabchick. There is little submerged vegetation but kahikatea bush has been planted to the north and west, with baumea, kawakawa, mahoe, manuka, swamp millet and Hypolepsis distans, wheki, mata, turutu and silver ferns.

With over 150 hiking trails extending for more than , within its boundaries, including a seventy-mile segment of the Appalachian Trail, hiking is the most popular activity in the national park . Development of hiking trails in the national park As plans to create a national park in the eastern United States began to unfold in the 1920s, specifically in the area of eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina, various organizations began the process of procuring lands and constructing for the eventual national park. At the same time, the Great Depression had wrought havoc among the nation's people, leaving many homeless and unemployed. One of the organizations then-president Franklin Delano Roosevelt created to get Americans working again, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was instrumental in the development of the hiking trails and campsites in the national park. Many of the hundreds of miles of trails in the park were dug by the CCC in its formative years‚Äîeven those still in place today. Other hiking trails were, in another incarnation, in use hundreds of years in the past. Before the settlement of Anglo-Americans, largely from Scotland and Ireland, in the area of today's Great Smoky Mountain National Park, the region was a small portion of the expansive Cherokee territory. The Cherokee often traveled over the mountains via established routes for trading and reaching hunting grounds away from their homes. Over the years with the steadying encroachment of white settlers, many of the old Cherokee mountain roads were adapted to the uses of the new settlers and, eventually, a few of these were converted over to some of the hiking trails in the national park . In addition to the work of the Civilian Conservation Corps and mountain routes of the Cherokee Indians, various hiking clubs have also worked to improve upon currently established trails and to construct entirely new trails in their own right. Perhaps the most popular of these, the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, which promotes the conservation of the Appalachian Trail, works through an affiliated club to maintain the trail within the national park. Other similar groups perform similar functions on trails throughout the park. Hiking trails of the national park Of the more than 150 hiking trails in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, the majority of traffic centers on a few of the shorter trails located just off the main highway, U.S. Highway 441 (Newfound Gap Road). The lengthier, more isolated trails are much less frequented, though, at any one time, very few hikers are completely alone in the park. Trails in the park cover all types; Short, self-guided nature trails are found off the highways in purposely diverse areas of the park, while longer, strenuous backpacking hikes are available along the Appalachian and various other primarily highland trails. Some trails are paved, some lead to waterfalls, others to overlooks, and still others lead to more trails. =Cross-country trails= Perhaps the most famous trail in the world (certainly in the United States), the Appalachian Trail bisects the national park, for most of its length within the park running on the border of Tennessee and North Carolina. Another lesser known, more recently constructed footpath, the Mountains-to-Sea Trail, begins (or ends) at the Clingmans Dome Observation Tower, and runs, as the name suggests, from North Carolina's mountainous border with Tennessee, to the Atlantic Ocean at Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. *Appalachian Trail: Seventy miles of the Appalachian Trail cut through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, entering northward at Davenport Gap and exiting southward near Fontana Dam. The trail remains among the crestline of the Great Smoky Mountains throughout this portion of its length, passing just behind the observation tower at Clingmans Dome, the highest point anywhere along the trail (at ). Shelters are placed approximately equidistant of one another, at locations roughly equivalent to one day of backpacking from one shelter to the next. While spending the night there is free, unless determined to be thru-hiking (which the national park determines as anyone starting a minimum of fifty miles [eighty kilometers] and ending at least as far outside of the park) it requires a permit obtainable through the park service to stay in the shelters. *Mountains-to-Sea Trail: Though only of the planned trail is completed, North Carolina's statewide trail is intended to stretch from the mountains of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to the state's Outer Banks on the Atlantic Ocean. The segment of the trail within the national park extends for twenty- five miles (forty kilometers) and is three-fourths completed, starting near the summit of Clingmans Dome. Since this part (and many other portions) of the trail is composed largely of other pre-existing trails, it is navigable for much of its existing length . =Trails: Cades Cove= Cades Cove is the most visited area of the most visited national park in the United States . Though most of these two million visitors each year don't veer very far away from the one-way loop road that traverses the valley, hiking trails accessible from the road are nonetheless still often busier than most. *Abrams Falls Trail: The Abrams Falls Trail, often clogged with visitors to Cades Cove, is the most popular trail in the area. It leads to the most voluminous waterfall in the national park, under which many summer patrons enjoy swimming in its large natural pool. The trail continues beyond the waterfall for to connect with Little Bottoms Trail and backcountry campsite 17. A total hike of will lead to the trail head at Abrams Creek campground. This is a much more difficult trail than the section from Cades Cove. Campsite 17 is fairly popular and much of the trail provides good access for fishing. *Gregory Bald Trail and Gregory Ridge Trail: The national park service only maintains two balds in the park: Andrews Bald and Gregory Bald. Two trails provide access to the grass bald, one of the largest in the national park. The [round trip] Gregory Bald Trail isn't in Cades Cove itself, but Parsons Branch Road, which provides dayhikers access to the trailhead, leads one way out of the cove, while the Gregory Ridge Trail [round trip] is just out of Cades Cove, on Forge Creek Road. Though the views that it offers are available year-round, Gregory Bald is most noted for the flame azaleas that bloom wildly in late June. *Rich Mountain Loop Trail: Rich Mountain dominates the Cades Cove valley. A one-way gravel road leads out of the national park over Rich Mountain, though this road is surprisingly lonely. The loop trail, though, gets a bit more traffic. Extending from its lone terminus at the foot of the Cades Cove Loop Road, the trail skirts just behind the popular John Oliver Cabin before ascending Rich Mountain, offering a few views down into the Cades Cove below, via a three trail path. Other trails in the area *Crooked Arm Ridge Trail *Grave Gap Trail *Rich Mountain Trail *Scott Mountain Trail =Trails: Cherokee Orchard/Roaring Fork= The Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail is a one way paved roadway accessible only via Cherokee Orchard Road just out of the small resort city of Gatlinburg. The area's proximity to Gatlinburg lends it to a relatively high number of visitors during mid-day in the peak tourist seasons and on weekends, though dayhikers usually concentrate at Grotto and Rainbow Falls. Three of the trails in this region lead to the summit of Mount Le Conte, one of the most popular destinations for hikers in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Here, the LeConte Lodge provides the only commercial lodging within the national park and annually sells out all of its rooms, which contain no electricity or running water, months in advance. The mountain is also popular for its vistas at Myrtle Point and the Cliff Tops. Bullhead Trail *Bullhead Trail: Of the five trails that lead to the summit of Mount Le Conte, the Bullhead Trail is the least popular. There are two reasons for this designation: its isolation and its lack of side attractions. Besides that accessing the trail requires at least a walk to the trailhead along the Old Sugarlands Trail, all of the other trails en route to the LeConte Lodge at Mount Le Conte pass by other significant landmarks, such as waterfalls or unique rock formations, but the Bullhead Trail simply ascends Le Conte. Of course, though, for some hikers, this loneliness is a good thing. *Baskins Creek Trail: Baskins Creek Falls is by far the least known waterfall in this area. The others, Rainbow and Grotto Falls, both get so many sightseers that their auxiliary parking lots are routinely overflown with vehicles. The round trip Baskins Creek Trail passes by an old cemetery just a few yards into its length where many residents of the area were buried before it became a national park. *Rainbow Falls Trail: One of the five trails that leads up Mount Le Conte, the Rainbow Falls Trail follows a route similar to that taken by a group of politicians before the creation of the national park to see just what the area had to offer. The trail's namesake, Rainbow Falls, which at eighty feet contains the highest single-drop of water in the national park, is located miles into the footpath to the summit of Mount Le Conte. While the trek to the waterfall will be bustling with hikers, once beyond Rainbow Falls the trail thins out considerably. *Trillium Gap Trail: Another of the five trails that ascends Mount Le Conte, the Trillium Gap Trail first passes behind Grotto Falls at , the only waterfall in the park where this is possible. Just like at the Rainbow Falls Trail, the hike to the waterfall will be quite busy under normal circumstances, but, from points onward of the falls, will be much less populated. Trillium Gap lies along the trail at a junction with the Brushy Mountain Trail, where hikers can choose to pay a visit to Brushy Mountain or continue on to the summit of Mount Le Conte. Other trails in the area *Grapeyard Ridge Trail *Old Sugarlands Trail =Trails: Cosby/Greenbrier= Cosby and Greenbrier campgrounds are located about fifteen miles (24 km) apart on the Tennessee side of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The campgrounds share many similarities and even a few connecting hiking trails. Each are found east of the city of Gatlinburg and, while there still exists a town of Cosby, the old Greenbrier community largely came to an end with the establishment of the national park in the 1930s. *Lower Mount Cammerer Trail: The Lower Mount Cammerer Trail is just one of a few trails that can be taken to reach the landmark Mount Cammerer lookout tower. This, along with the Appalachian and Low Gap trails are often taken as a loop trail back down to the Cosby Campground. The trail itself is , but the firetower from which panoramic views of the area are available is reached by a spur trail down the Appalachian Trail from the end of the Lower Mount Cammerer Trail. *Ramsey CascadesRamsey Cascades Trail: Located as deep as is accessible by motor vehicle in the Greenbrier Cove area, the beginning of the Ramsey Cascades Trail follows an old jeep road for about the first . Not far past here the trail enters the largest old-growth forest remaining in the national park. One of the primary reasons that the park was created was in response to the damage that the logging industry had done to the ancient forest in the region. This forest was one of the few to remain mostly unscathed. Some of the trees along the trail are among the largest known remaining in the park. The waterfall itself is about ninety feet high and is four miles (6.4 km) from the trailhead. Four people have died in recent years attempting to climb the waterfall; in response to this, the national park service advises spectators to refrain from climbing the rocks at the falls. One of these fatalities was Louise Barber, who at age 14 (circa 1963) decided to look over the falls from above and fell to her death. She was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. David West Barber, Jr. and granddaughter of David W. Barber, Sr., one of the original members of the Great Smoky Mountains Hikers Club. *Old Settlers Trail: The Old Settlers Trail is a very long footpath that links Greenbrier Cove to Cosby, passing of old homesteads from the days before the national park was created, moving out families that for generations lived and farmed the area. Most hikers arrange for this as a shuttle hike, whereby a friend or relative, or commercial service, is notified of about when the hiker is due to arrive at the trail's end and is driven out, rather than walking back to the beginning of the trail. *Gabes Mountain Trail: This trail, in length, is known more for its access to Henwallow Falls than anything else, though it does extend over four miles (6 km) further, past the Sugar Cove campsite at around before running out at a junction with the Maddron Bald Trail. The trail begins just before the parking lot at the Cosby Campground. Other trails in the area *Brushy Mountain Trail *Maddron Bald Trail *Low Gap Trail *Snake Den Ridge Trail *Porters Creek Trail =Trails: Clingmans Dome= The highest point both in the State of Tennessee and along the Appalachian Trail, Clingmans Dome is also the hub of numerous dayhikes and longer backpacking trips. The mountain itself is one of the most popular destinations in the national park, as a seven-mile (11 km) paved road allows visitors to park only a half mile from the concrete observation tower erected in 1963, from which views into several states (on clear days) are available. *Clingmans Dome/Clingmans Dome Bypass Trails: The only trail that possibly gets more traffic than the Clingmans Dome Trail is the Laurel Falls Trail near the park headquarters. Because of such heavy visitation, the park service has paved each trail, both for better accessibility and to stem erosion. Many visitors to the mountain, however, are unaware of the Clingmans Dome Bypass Trail, which is reached by walking a tenth of a mile off the main trail, and then rises steeply to the Appalachian Trail. Some hikers use this as a means to avoid the clogged paved trail and continue on their way to points beyond the tower, while others see it as a more traditional route to the observation tower, which is a third of a mile (half of a kilometer) to the right of the junction with the Appalachian Trail. *Forney Ridge Trail: Reached by veering left at the base of the Clingmans Dome Trail, the Forney Ridge Trail immediately descends via a carefully implemented level of stairs built into the ground for a tenth of a mile to a junction with the Clingmans Dome Bypass Trail. From here the rocky trail continues to the left through highland Appalachian terrain to Andrews Bald, one of only two balds maintained by the National Park Service. The hike to the bald is fairly popular, though not nearly to the extent of its neighboring trail to Clingmans Dome, but very few hikers venture beyond Andrews Bald, as the trail descends down Forney Ridge to Board Camp Gap and a junction with the Springhouse Branch Trail. *Road Prong Trail: Named for the stream the trail accompanies for its entire length, the Road Prong Trail follows an old Indian trail that was used for an unknown length of time before the settlement of whites in the region, who eventually widened the trail into a toll road, which was used from 1839 for nearly a century until the discovery of Newfound Gap and the subsequent construction of Newfound Gap Road, which effectively put Indian Gap Road (as the road had become known) out of commission. The \\"road\\" is today little more than a trail that links Clingmans Dome Road, at Indian Gap, to Newfound Gap Road (as the Road Prong Trail runs into the Chimney Tops Trail at its lower terminus) one mile (1.6 km) from the junction. Other trails in the area *Appalachian Trail *Mountains-to-Sea Trail *Forney Creek Trail *Noland Divide Trail *Spruce Fir Nature Trail =Trails: Little River Road/Elkmont/Tremont= Beginning at a fork with Newfound Gap Road and the national park headquarters at Sugarlands Visitor Center, Little River Road links the main park thoroughfare with Cades Cove, the most popular destination in the national park. The road also provides access to the Elkmont Campground (and the historic community that once thrived there), Metcalf Bottoms Picnic Area, and the Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont. *Laurel Falls Trail: Probably the most popular trail in the entire national park, the wildly popular walk to Laurel Falls has been paved by the park service, as the heavy traffic was causing major erosion to the former traditional footpath. The trail does go on for a total length of to the lookout tower at Cove Mountain, but this portion is mostly neglected by hikers, most of whom stop at the waterfall, one of the largest in the national park. *Gatlinburg Trail: Only two trails in the national park allow pets (on leashes) and bicycles, and this is one of them. Most hikers pick up the Gatlinburg Trail from behind the Sugarlands Visitor Center and walk along the West Prong of the Little Pigeon River right into the city of Gatlinburg. In fact, since the trail ends at the foot of the city of Gatlinburg, a visitor staying in the resort community can walk out of his or her hotel room, onto the sidewalk, and into the national park and the Gatlinburg Trail without taking one-hundred steps. *Spruce Flats FallsSpruce Flats Falls Trail: This trail really has no name, is not marked, and, without knowing in advance where s/he is going, a hiker would not have any knowledge of the waterfall at the end of this trail. Because of its anonymity, Spruce Flats Falls is the most likely least visited waterfall of its size in the national park. The trail itself is only slightly longer than a mile in length and offers some views of nearby mountains before descending to the waterfall. Stop in the first building on your left after crossing the bridge at Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont to get a map and details about this trail. Other trails in the area *Sugarland Mountain Trail *Meigs Mountain Trail *Roundtop Trail *Cove Mountain Trail *Old Sugarlands Trail *Jakes Creek Trail =Trails: Newfound Gap Road= As the primary roadway through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Newfound Gap Road (U.S. Highway 441), is the hub of activity in the national park. Both of the largest visitors centers are on either end of the highway, near Gatlinburg (Sugarlands) and just out of Cherokee, North Carolina (Oconaluftee), as are most of the most popular hiking trails in the park. Newfound Gap, about midway into the park, is home to the Rockefeller Memorial, from which Franklin Roosevelt dedicated the national park in 1940. The gap is also crossed by the Appalachian Trail, which crosses alongside the memorial and over the highway towards Clingmans Dome. Views from Alum Cave Bluff Trail *Alum Cave Bluff Trail: The most popular of the five trails that lead to the summit of Mount Le Conte and the LeConte Lodge, the Alum Cave Bluff Trail has two parking areas which are both filled and spilt over onto the roadside. Most of the people hiking the trail do so for the unique rock formations at Arch Rock, just in the trail, and Alum Cave Bluff, about a mile further along. From about the point onward, the trail is one of (if not the single most) scenic trails in the national park, which, combined with its short length relative to the other Le Conte trails (), makes it also the favored trail for those heading to the Le Conte massif. *Chimney Tops Trail: Another of the very popular Newfound Gap Road trails, the Chimney Tops Trail owes much of its popularity to its short length and notoriously panoramic summit. The length, only , however, makes for a very steep hike ‚Äî so much so that many would-be hikers do not reach the summit. Once at the top, signs erected by the National Park Service remind hikers to exercise caution, not to stray beyond the peaks of the Chimney Tops, as the fame and treachery of the Chimney Tops' summit has led to numerous injuries of often careless enthusiasts. *The Boulevard Trail: Though only in length, The Boulevard Trail is accessible only by trail; the closest and most common point of entry being along the Appalachian Trail from Newfound Gap, the total hike to Mount Le Conte and the LeConte Lodge amounts to . The Boulevard is the highest path to Le Conte: it is the only Le Conte trail that begins above , and nowhere along the route does the elevation fall below . In addition, The Boulevard is the only trail to pass alongside High Top, the Le Conte's highest peak. *Appalachian Trail ‚Äî Newfound Gap to Charlie's Bunion: This popular dayhike leading from Newfound Gap comprises a four-mile (6.4 km) portion of the Appalachian Trail to Charlie's Bunion, from which expansive views are afforded into the surrounding mountains.

He was considered a hero among the Hmong nationalists, but regarded as a crazed man among the French- subdued Hmong, but in present times, he is unanimously considered a national hero. Political setting From the late 15th century onward, the European Powers raced to conquer the world. By the late 19th century the British Empire was the largest Empire in the world. France sought to balance the British influence in China and India by conquering the land in between. By the late 19th century, France had consolidated all the nations in Southeast Asia into one conglomerate known as French Indochina. In the years following the beginning of World War I, the French's colonial strangle-hold in Indochina was beginning to weaken. Though they had conquered Indochina hoping to benefit economically, the French gained little from the venture. So in response to the high cost of war in Europe, the French heavily taxed the people of Indochina in the form of silver bars, and opium cash crop. The Hmong bore the brunt of the burden because they were already marginalized by the Lao, Vietnamese, and Tai people. The situation became so bad that many were forced to sell their children to pay the tax. Youth Pa Chay was an Hmong Vue orphan who grew up in L√†o Cai Province, Vietnam, which is still a stronghold of the Hmong. He was raised by an Vue uncle, Xao Chu Vue (RPA: Xauv Tswb Vwj) who adopted him. After his marriage and the birth of his first child he claimed to be called by God to show the Hmong how to live in good health and harmony with their environment and to free the Hmong people from the oppressors, mainly the Tai and French. As proof of his divine calling, he performed spectacular feats, such as jumping onto the top of a house, making a ball of cotton explode, etc. He was also instructed on a Hmong writing system which was practiced by many of his followers. People began to revere Pa Chay as the long-awaited Hmong leader who the elders have been waiting for to usher a period where Hmong would again have a kingdom. Pa Chay used his influence and the reputation of his miraculous powers to convince his followers that he could deliver his people from French domination. Many Hmong united and began a nationalist Hmong movement which drew villagers from all over northern Laos, northern Vietnam, and parts of southern China. Pa Chay then organized the Hmong nationalists to fight against the French in the rebellion known as \\"Guerre Du Fou\\" (Madman's War \\"Rog Paj Cai\\"). He also attracted the support of other oppressed minorities, mainly the Mab Daum and Khmu. The war The stimulus for the rebellion was heavy taxation by the French and abuse of power by the ethnic Lao and Tai tax collectors. The Hmong people were divided into two opposing sides - those who resented the yoke of slavery under France, and those few who benefited from French patronage at the expense of their own people. The rebellion, called \\"Rog Paj Cai\\" by the Hmong Nationalists and \\"Rog Phim Npab\\" by Hmong who sided with the French, was a self-initiated and self-sustaining movement; all the guns were the Hmong-designed and manufactured flintlocks (a bit different from the traditional western flintlock gun). The gunpowder was also of a Hmong sort (salt peter, charcoal, and guano is used similar to western black powder, but shavings from a type of tree is added to increase the explositivity). The Hmong won battle after battle, in for the majority of the rebellion; the French were surprised and did not know how to fight in the jungles nor did they know how to fight a near invisible army. France was also heavily involved in World War I in Europe, and resorted to using 50% French and 50% native Vietnamese, Lao, and Tai, and traitor Hmong soldiers, who all had little desire to fight the liberating Hmong forces. The following below is incorrect. This was during the indochina war between the Chinese and Hmong: One particular weapon that especially scared the French army was the Hmong cannon, made with the trunk of a tree, and packed with metal pieces from pots, and a lot Hmong gunpowder. This cannon was designed by Kuab Chav, and is said to have weighed over 200 lbs, such that only one man named Lwv was able to carry it. As the French army came up the mountainous trails, the cannon would spray the metal shards at the French army, sending them into hiding while wounding and killing many of them. They never knew what it was because they assumed the Hmong did not have the technology to build such a weapon. The French morale was also weakened because of rumors of that Pa Chay's army was protected by magic. As the French Army chased the Hmong army through the mountainous passes and ravines, they never saw any dead Hmong soldiers. The reason was that Pa Chay had commanded his men to never leave anyone behind, and to cover up the blood as quickly as possible. This gave the illusion to the French that indeed Pa Chay's army was invincible. Kao Mee, a sister of Pa Chay, also played an important role. She carried a white flag made of hemp, which she used to deflect bullets. She is said to have been a righteous virgin, which is why the Heavens allowed her to have such miraculous powers. She led the army into many success in battle. At its height, the rebellion encompassed 40,000 square kilometres of Indochina, from ƒêi·ªán Bi√™n Ph·ªß in Tonkin to Nam Ou in Luang Prabang, and from Muong Cha north of Vientiane to Sam Neua in Laos. As World War I came to an end, the French reinforcements began to outnumber, and their firepower outpowered the Hmongs. They also learned from certain Hmong informants such as Lauj Kiab Toom, that the Hmong gunpowder does not work well when wet, so they attacked especially during the monsoon season. The Hmong believed their defeats were temporary, caused by violations of the Oath to Heaven by some of the soldiers, and despite these defeats, there was still strong support from the populace. Death In addition to their military might, the French also understood (through the ethnographic works of Fran√ßois-Marie Savina, a Catholic missionary) that in order to stop the rebellion they would have to kill the \\"messiah\\" ‚Äì Pa Chay. Knowing the historical conflicts between the Khmu and the Hmong, they hired Khmu mercenaries to find Pa Chay. Many Hmong believe they also hired men who were close to Pa Chay to kill him. Of the five men hired to assassinate Pa Chay, Qhua Kuam Lis is the only one known by name, and the only Hmong. One of the Khmu hired is said to have a been a close friend and high commander of Pa Chay. Pa Chay was carrying his youngest child on his back at the farm house used for his hideout in Muong Heup, Luang Prabang, on 17 November 1921. The bullet pierced the child and killed both the child and Pa Chay Vue. His head was cut off and, along with his flintlock gun, was to be taken to the French officials as proof of his death. Because of previous demonstration by Pa Chay that a steel blade could not cut him, it is believed that the bullet was shot through the child to make sure his 'magic' did not protect him. The French paid each assassin 500 bars of silver. Aftermath The French were not satisfied with this however; they captured many of those who had laid down their arms and sent them to Xieng Khouang (the headquarters for the colonial power in Laos) where some of them were decapitated and some were thrown off of high platforms into glass shards. A man known as Tus Cheem Rog (the one who stopped the war - presumed by many to be Savina), came to plea on behalf of the people so that not everyone who was sent to Xieng Khouang would have to die. This man came to stay at Txooj Tub Yiv Vwj's house in Xieng Khoung and left his heavy jacket. He is described as a tall non-Hmong person who spoke fluent Hmong. Interesting enough he is also described as having worn a turban head wrap. Kao Mee was also hunted down and killed by Khmu and French soldiers. The French offered a bounty of 20 silver bars, and then 200 silver bars to find the family of Pa Chay. They claimed it was because they had taken away Pa Chay, so they wanted to care for his wife and kids. Of course no Hmong person was stupid enough to betray the family. Everytime the French came into his village, the villagers would tell them that Pa Chay's wife was just an old Hmoob Lauj lady with no children. They left her alone, either because she was so old, or because they knew it wasn't true. Regardless, when that old lady died, Pa Chay's family killed a white buffalo for her because she was willing to take the punishment on behalf of the family. Legacy The revolt against the French served to strengthen the bond between the pro-French Hmong leaders and their colonial rulers for another generation. Kiatong LoBliaYao (Lauj Npliaj Yob), a French loyalist and puppet leader, extorted many silver bars from those who had been loyal to Pa Chay Vue in exchange for their lives, an action that many Hmong still remember even today, and which also ultimately caused his power to be given to Touby Lyfoung, his nephew. Touby Lyfoung was the famous Hmong royalist who fought, in succession, the Japanese, the Vietnamese and the Lao Communists. To this day there is still a flower, called Pa Chay's grass (Nroj Paj Cai), that blooms every year around the months of December and January. This little red flower appeared for the first time following his death that year and thus it was named in his honor to commemorate his legacy. The communist Vietnamese and Lao government created a military squadron in honor of Pa Chay, called, (Kong Pang Pa Chai) Koos Phaas Paj Cai. This squadron was heavily used during the Vietnam war as propaganda to recruit Hmong people, and to do ambush attacks. All members of this squadron are of the Hmong ethnic group, though in recent years there has been an effort to integrate more Laotian into the unit to prevent any possible collusion of rebellion. The squadron is heavily used to fight the Chao Fa (Hmong Freedom Fighters) in Laos.

SMAD9, as its name describes, is a homolog of the Drosophila gene: \\"Mothers against decapentaplegic\\". It belongs to the SMAD family of proteins, which belong to the TGFŒ≤ superfamily of modulators. Like many other TGFŒ≤ family members, SMAD9 is involved in cell signalling. When a bone morphogenetic protein binds to a receptor (BMP type 1 receptor kinase) it causes SMAD9 to interact with SMAD anchor for receptor activation (SARA).The binding of ligands causes the phosphorylation of the SMAD9 protein and the dissociation from SARA and the association with SMAD4. It is subsequently transferred to the nucleus where it forms complexes with other proteins and acts as a transcription factor. SMAD9 is a receptor regulated SMAD (R-SMAD) and is activated by bone morphogenetic protein type 1 receptor kinase. There are two isoforms of the protein. Confusingly, it is also sometimes referred to as SMAD8 in the literature.  Nomenclature  The SMAD proteins are homologs of both the drosophila protein, mothers against decapentaplegic (MAD) and the C. elegans protein SMA. The name is a combination of the two. During Drosophila research, it was found that a mutation in the gene, MAD, in the mother, repressed the gene, decapentaplegic, in the embryo. The phrase \\"Mothers against\\" was added since mothers often form organizations opposing various issues e.g. Mothers Against Drunk Driving or (MADD); and based on a tradition of such unusual naming within the gene research community.\\"Sonic Hedgehog, DICER, and the Problem With Naming Genes\\", Sep 26, 2014, Michael White. psmag.com  References  Category:Developmental genes and proteins Category:MH1 domain Category:MH2 domain Category:R-SMAD Category:Transcription factors Category:Human proteins ","title":"Mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 9"},{"id":"5688858","text":"George Hendric Houghton (February 1, 1820 - November 17, 1897) was an American Protestant Episcopal clergyman.

It was the location of the Aboke abductions, in October 1996. Location Aboke is located in Akwiridid Parish, Aboke sub-county, Kole District, in the Lango sub-region, in Northern Uganda. It is approximately , by road, north-west of the city of Lira, the largest urban centre in the sub-region. This is approximately , by road, southeast of the city of Gulu, the largest urban centre in Northern Uganda. The geographical coordinates of Aboke are:02¬∞21'28.0\\"N, 32¬∞40'59.0\\"E (Latitude:2.357778; Longitude:32.683056). Aboke sits at an average elevation of above sea level. Overview Aboke lies on the old Lira-Gulu Road, just north of the Okole River. The town is the location of the five-parish Aboke sub-county. The parishes in Aboke sub-county are: (a) Akwiridid (b) Apach (c) Apuru (d) Ogwangacuma and (e) Opeta. The town is also the location of St. Mary's College Aboke Girls School, a residential girls-only secondary school administered by Italian nuns. It is at this school that the Aboke abductions occurred on the early morning of 10 October 1996. Aboke abductions The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), the rebel group which started in January 1987 by Joseph Kony, began as a liberation group aimed at removing the National Resistance Movement led by Yoweri Museveni from power. In the early 1990s the LRA began to receive support and supplies from the government of Sudan at that time. The character of the LRA changed. The rebels began to target civilians, mutilating those they thought to be government sympathisers and abducting children as child soldiers and sex slaves. In the early morning hours of 10 October 1996, an estimated 300 rebels of the LRA invaded St Mary‚Äôs College Secondary School Aboke and abducted 139 young girls aged 13 to 16 years of age. Sister Rachele Frassera, an Italian nun, who was the deputy headmistress at the school, followed the rebels and negotiated the release of 109 girls. The rebels kept the other 30 as sex slaves for their commanders. Four of the girls died in captivity while the remaining 26 eventually escaped from Sudan, back to their families in Uganda. Many had babies fathered by the rebels, including Joseph Kony himself. The girl to escape was Catherine Ajok, who on 14 December 2008, escaped from the LRA when the UPDF bombed the LRA base in Garamba, in the DR Congo. She arrived at a UPDF base in Dungu, DRC, in March 2009.

There are two versions of this story, one published in 1902 and the other in 1908. The story written in 1908 has become an often anthologized classic, while the 1902 story is less well known. The 1908 version is about an unnamed male protagonist who ventures out in the subzero boreal forest of the Yukon Territory. He is followed by a native dog and is en route to visit his friends‚Äîignoring warnings from an older man (an elder from the Sulphur Creek) about the dangers of hiking alone in extreme cold. The protagonist underestimates the harsh conditions and slowly begins to freeze to death. After building a fire and leaving it to continue his journey, he later attempts to build another. He then tries to kill the dog to gain access to its body heat, but fails to do either. He slips into unconsciousness and dies of hypothermia. The 1902 version describes a similar situation with a different plot. Though the structure and story line are similar in both, in 1902 the weather is not as cold and horrendous, no dog follows the protagonist, the fire is not doused, and the man (named Tom Vincent) suffers only from permanent frostbite and survives to become a more melancholic but wiser person. The 1908 \\"To Build a Fire\\" is an oft-cited example of the naturalist movement that portrays the conflict of man vs. nature. It also reflects what London learned in the Yukon Territory. 1908 version plot An unnamed man sets out to hike through the forests bordering the Yukon River on a winter day whose temperature has fallen to ‚àí75 ¬∞F (‚àí59 ¬∞C). Having ignored warnings against traveling alone in such conditions, he is accompanied only by a large husky dog. The animal's instincts warn it about the dangers of the extreme cold, but the dog follows the man unwillingly. As they follow the course of a frozen creek, the man is careful to avoid patches of thin ice hidden by the snow that cover pockets of unfrozen water. His goal is to reach a group of prospectors (\\"the boys\\") at their camp by six o'clock that evening. At half past noon, the man stops and builds a fire so he can warm up and eat his lunch. Shortly after resuming his hike, he accidentally breaks through the ice and soaks his feet and lower legs, forcing him to stop and build another fire so he can dry himself. Having chosen a spot under a tree for this fire, he pulls twigs from the brush pile around it to feed the flames; the vibrations eventually cause the snow to tumble down from the branches overhead and extinguish the fire. The man quickly begins to lose sensation in his extremities and hurries to light another fire, now starting to understand the warnings about the life-threatening danger posed by the extreme cold. He lights the fire, igniting all of his matches and burning himself in the process due to the numbness in his hands. While trying to remove a piece of moss from the fire, he inadvertently pokes the burning twigs apart and extinguishes them. With no way to start another fire, the man tries to kill the dog and use its body heat to save himself, but his hands are so stiff that he can neither strangle the animal nor draw his knife to cut its throat. Finally, he tries to restore his circulation by running toward the camp, but stumbles and falls multiple times in the snow. The man dies of hypothermia, imagining himself standing with \\"the boys\\" as they find his body, and the dog leaves the body after dark to find food and shelter at the camp. Character relationships The protagonist and the old man of Sulphur Creek are seen in the beginning of the story. The old man of Sulphur Creek warns the protagonist about the danger of travelling alone in such cold temperatures, but being ignorant the protagonist scoffs at the advice of the old man. The protagonist is seen reflecting on his advice towards his demise, and realizes that the old man of Sulphur Creek was right in his warning. The man and the dog's relationship is followed throughout the story. The man has strict control of the dog, as explicitly mentioned by London. The dog is almost like the man's slave. The dog is shown cowering before the man and following orders. There is no physical intimacy or compassion between the two. The man does not pet the dog or treat it fondly. In fact, the man forces the dog to go ahead of him when he suspects the ice will break. This helps to build the idea that the man believes nature is intended to serve him. The man's interactions in this relationship is how the reader discovers the man's personality and character. By including the dog, the author makes the man less likable. He was cruel towards the dog by having the dog walk in extreme temperatures. Moreover, in the end, he tried to kill the dog for his own benefit. London even describes the dog as his \\"toil-slave\\". Full text of the famous second version, published for an adult audience. While the man sees the dog only as his slave on the journey, the dog sees the man as a provider of his needs, which helps follow his instincts. Placing the dog in the story allowed London to show the wisdom of nature over the arrogance of the man, which eventually leads to his demise. Doing so, allowed London to show that animals survive through instinct. On the other hand, London shows that men who lack that same intellect, such as man in the story, fail and don't survive. Themes \\"Man vs. Nature\\" is one of the themes present in this short story. The protagonist decides to face the brutally cold temperatures of the Yukon Territory, despite being warned by an older man. The short story depicts the protagonist's battle of life and death while highlighting the importance of the fire. One theme illustrated in the story is the man's sense of judgment contrasted with the dog's animal instincts. Throughout the story, London hints that the dog has more knowledge of survival than the man. The judgment-versus-instinct theme is evident when the man builds the first fire. While the dog wants to stay by the fire to keep warm, the man is determined to keep moving. As the dog reluctantly follows the man across a frozen river, the dog is more cautious than the man. The protagonist's desperation is evident throughout the majority of the story. It is noticeable soon after the man falls into a frozen-over river. In order to save himself, he scrambles to build a fire but is too busy worrying about his survival to notice the mistake of building a fire underneath a tree which has collected an enormous amount of snow. After the first fire is put out, his desperation becomes more defined as he seemingly will do anything to survive, including attempting to kill his dog for warmth and using all his matches at once in a final attempt to light his last fire. His desperation for survival and his fear of death cause him to panic, leading to his final demise as he freezes to death at the end of the story. =Perseverance= Another evident theme in the story is perseverance. Although the man makes several mistakes and is getting frostbite in his fingers and toes, he continues to fight for survival. He ignored all the signs that he would not make it to the village he was headed to. For instance, London described ‚ÄúHe did not bare his fingers more than a minute and was surprised to find that they were numb.‚Äù In less than 60 seconds his fingers were numb indicating to him that it is too dangerous for him to be outside. =Wisdom and Experience= Another theme that is present is that of wisdom and experience. London shows us throughout the story that the man lacks the knowledge in order to survive in the Yukon. Based on instincts, the dog knew that it was too cold to travel in the snow. London wrote: ‚ÄúThe dog was sorry to leave and looked toward the fire.‚Äù This line indicates that the dog wanted to be closer to heat. However, the unnamed protagonist ignored all the signs before him. He knew that it was cold but he did not realize the threat this posed on his life. Stupidity and arrogance are personified in the story's protagonist. For example, he goes through the extremely cold territory alone, despite going for the first time. He laughs off the crucial advice from the old man of Sulphur Creek about traveling with an acquaintance because he thinks he knows what he's doing. This arrogance results in the protagonist putting himself in a dangerous situation that was preventable. At first, he thinks it's nothing and that everything will be fine. By the end of the story, he dies as a result of his arrogance. Through this story, London shows how the man's demise is due to his humanity and lack of thought when going into this journey. Also, he shows that the dog survives because of following its instincts which is something that the man does not pay attention to. Another example of arrogance occurs when the protagonist disregards the possibility that there may be situations he cannot overcome. The old man warns the protagonist of this and also seems to have a better understanding of the natural world, respecting the fact that there are some situations the man will be unable to control. Not only does the old man see the protagonist's stupidity, but the dog notices the man's lack of knowledge about the terrain and its obstacles after he fails to keep a fire going. =Death= Succumbing to death is another theme in the story: more specifically the peace that may be found in death. London foreshadows the death of the man early in the story, so it is not a surprise that the man dies and closer to the end, he recalls the cold and the old timer as he accepts his fate. However, London depicts death quite differently than many other authors do. The man drifts off into a calm, peaceful slumber devoid of suffering and pain. London's use of relaxing words dissuades the reader from feeling a great deal of sympathy for the man, as the death is merciful and graciously anticipated, rather than sad. In contrast to more dramatic depictions of death, London's depiction reveals death as a peaceful escape from tumult and pain. =Individualism= Another common theme London portrays in the story is individualism. The man only relies on himself to get him through the Yukon; he doesn't believe that he needs any help. This theme can also be connected to the theme mentioned above of the man's judgment, and the man's arrogance. 1902 version The earlier version was first published in The Youth's Companion on May 29, 1902. Full text of the first, more juvenile version. Although it differs in some details, the general structure and storyline are similar; the primary differences are as follows: in the first version it is not as cold, there is no dog, the fire is not doused, and the man (named Tom Vincent) suffers some permanent frostbite damage but survives, sad but wiser.

Arhangela Mihaila) is a Serbian Orthodox cathedral church in the centre of Belgrade, Serbia, situated in the old part of the city, at the intersection of Kralja Petra and Kneza Sime Markoviƒáa streets. It was built between 1837 and 1840, on the location of an older church also dedicated to Archangel Michael. It is one of the most important places of worship in the country. It is commonly known as just Saborna crkva (The Cathedral) among the city residents. It was proclaimed as a Cultural Monument of Exceptional Importance in 1979. The cathedral church is one of the few preserved monuments of Belgrade from the first half of the 19th century. During the times when new social and political structures were slowly emerging, the cathedral church became a central support in the independence fight from Turkish centralism to the final freedom from Ottoman rule. History =Older church= There was an older church, dedicated to St. Archangel Michael, at the site of today's church. Protestant priest and a writer on travel Stjepan Gerlach provided valuable records of its looks in his descriptions of travels of the Emperor's delegates to Istanbul, 1573‚Äì1578. Although spacious, with all necessary liturgical accessories and furniture, it was not large enough to receive all the Christian citizens of Belgrade. King Peter I's coronation on 21 September 1904 Later records of existence of this churchBeside the cathedral church dedicated to Saint Archangel Michael, some sources (as Spomenica Saborne crkve u Beogradu), about existence of one more church in former Belgrade, that was dedicated to Saint John the Baptist, but without any closer records. were mainly saved by travel writers from the 17th and 18th centuries. During the Austro‚ÄìTurkish conflicts in the beginning of the 18th century it was destroyed, and the Austrian authorities were explicit in their order not to restore the damaged Serbian temples. Former Metropolitan Mojsije Petroviƒá, who had expected the support of Russian Czar Peter The Great, who had meanwhile died, started renewal of the Church from its foundations, decorating it with a new iconostasis. Following the Treaty of Belgrade concluded in 1739, Ottoman Turks once again entered Belgrade and \\"as soon as they entered the town they showed their anger toward Serbs and Serbian relics on this occasion\\".Joakim Vujic, Putesestvije po Srbiji, I knjiga, 1828. godina, Beograd, 1901, 23. Impressive residence of Serbian Metropolitan was torn down, and the church was \\"robbed and its roof torn down\\". Few decades later, at the beginning of 1798, the church once again suffered from damage, this time from fire. Repaired for services it served until the beginning of 1813, when after breaking of the First Serbian Uprising Turks desecrated and robbed it. Necessary restoration work was performed after the Second Serbian Uprising. Following the Sultan's Hatisheriff on the day of St. Andrew in 1830, which granted Serbs the freedom to perform the religious service, and by the order of Prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá a wooden bell tower was built beside the old church.Nikola Nestorovic, Gradjevine i arhitekti u Begradu proslog stoleca, Beograd, 1937, 22. For the purpose of bell casting, a great fire was lit, which burned for three days. People would pass by and throw various silver objects to mould with bronze that was melting, so the bells would have \\"a more silvery\\" sound. Former Belgrade citizens were waiting for this happening \\"as for something great and unreachable. For them the sound of bells did not represent just an ordinary religious custom. The bells represented a symbol of centuries-expected victory\\".Spomenica Saborne crkve u Beogradu, 41. Decision brought by Prince Milo≈° was accepted among Turks with doubt and threat. An anecdote was saved until present days about a threat of Belgrade's vizier Husein-Pasha Gavanozoglu (1827‚Äì1833) referring to Duke Petar ƒåukiƒá, who was in charge of construction of the bells, that he shall be punished for that. The Duke replied: \\"I know, I know efendi Pasha, if I raise them I shall die of Turkish hand, and if I do not, I shall die of hand of my master Prince Milo≈°. I prefer to die from a Turkish hand than from the hand of my master, as his disobedient servant.\\".Dragan J. Rankovic, Iz Beogradske proslosti, BON, 1938. br. 3, 210 Today, the bell of the old cathedral church is situated in the bell tower of the Church of the Ascension (1863) along with four more historical bells, different in size and origin. This bell sounded for the first time on 15 February 1830 when Serbian Princedom got its autonomy. Destroyed and repaired, the old church had struggled until 22 June 1836, when, after numerous discussions, Prince Milo≈° ordered the church to be torn down and a new one constructed. Construction of the new cathedral church had begun on 28 April 1837. Its foundations were consecrated on 15 July 1837, Milan Dj. Milicevic, Uspomene, 1831-1855, Beograd, 1952, 61. a contemporary described as an exceptional happening, witnessed by Metropolitan Petar Jovanoviƒá, Church dignitaries of high rank, Princess Ljubica and successors Milan and Mihailo, serfs, children and \\"folk of both sexes\\". The cannons were roaring and people were saying \\"church blessing this happy and happier time\\". On the day of patron's feast day of the church, St. Archangel Michael, on 8 November 1845, Metropolitan Petar Jovanoviƒá has consecrated the finished church and served the first liturgy in it. Stari Grad Although the author of the design remained controversial for a long time, it is certain that the Church was built by constructors from Panƒçevo, according to project made by Franz Jancke Friedrich Adam Querfeld. =Present church= The cathedral was built between 1837 and 1840. The gold-plated carved iconostasis was made by the sculptor Dimitrije Petroviƒá, while the icons on the iconostasis, thrones, choirs and pulpits, as well as those on the walls and arches were painted by Dimitrije Avramoviƒá, one of the most distinguished Serbian painters of the 19th century. The Cathedral church was one of the biggest religious buildings in Serbia, and after the Church of Peter and Paul in Topƒçider (1832‚Äì1834), the oldest in Belgrade. The Church has a single nave construction with semi-circular apse on the East side and narthex on the West side above which the high bell tower is rising. The inner space is divided to alter part, nave and narthex in which baptistery and stairs leading to bell tower are situated. Diff erent from the North and South fa√ßade, shaped simply and in the same manner, the West fa√ßade is emphasized by distinct portal and wide entrance stairs. Architecture of the cathedral church directly adopted with its assembly and fine proportions the standards of neoclassical churches with recognizable baroque tower, that were built at the same time in Austria. Somewhat older cathedral church in Sremski Karlovci (1758), which also belongs to this group, could have been a possible model. Architecture of this church was used as a model in sacral architecture during the reign of Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá. Decoration and interior works were performed after finishing of the construction. Belgrade's church municipality hired a sculptor, engraver and smelter, Dimitrije Petroviƒá (1799‚Äì1852), educated on the Academy in Vienna to make drawings for iconostas and choir. Exuberant in form with certain eclectic decorative elements, iconostas of the cathedral church in Belgrade is certainly the most prestigious classicist iconostas in Serbia. Painting of the cathedral church was confided to one of the most famous 19th-century Serbian painters Dimitrije Avramoviƒá (1815‚Äì1855), who painted eighteen big wall compositions and almost fifty icons for iconostas during the period of 1841 to 1845. The artist was under the influence of the historical school of Vienna and German Nazarenes, but his distinct feeling for a dramatic colour scheme and plastic-dramatic rhythm created a recognizable Serbian manner. He has created unique monumental compositions of religious content at the walls of the cathedral church, highly evaluated in newer Serbian painting. Besides painting, engraving works on the iconostasis, choir and pulpit, wall paintings, a treasury presents a special value, where applied art objects are kept ‚Äì golden products from the 18th and 19th centuries, priests' garments, crosses, individual icons from second half of the 19th century and other objects of cultural historical importance. A detail featuring Serbian coat of arms, interior of the church In the vicinity of the Church, in today's Zadarska Street and part of Kralja Petra Street and Kosanƒçiƒáev Venac an old Serbian graveyard was situated. Its gradual broadening included the church yard of the Cathedral, which was not fenced during the first decades of the 19th century and it served as a graveyard, where prominent Serbian persons of those times were buried. The skull of Duke Karaƒëorƒëe was buried in the south part of the Church yard until 1837, when it was, according to wish and order of Princess Ljubica taken out and transferred to Topola. The relics of St. Czar Uros and St. Despot Stefan ≈†tiljanoviƒá (‚Ä†1540), tombs of Serbian rulers Prince Milo≈° (1780‚Äì1860) and Mihailo Obrenoviƒá (1823‚Äì1868), as well as the tombs of certain Church dignitaries are situated in the Church. Serbian writer and educator Dositej Obradoviƒá (1742‚Äì1811) and reformer of Serbian language Vuk Karad≈æiƒá (1787‚Äì1864) were buried in front of the main entrance of the Church. The first Belgrade Singers Society ‚Äì performing Serbian sacred music, which is active today as well, was founded in 1853 at the cathedral church. This choir has been conducted by all distinguished composers of Serbian music, like Josif Marinkoviƒá, Stevan Mokranjac, Kornelije Stankoviƒá and others. Relics and graves The special value of the church is its treasury, in which the relics of Serbian saints emperor Stefan Uro≈° V, parts of the relics of Lazar of Serbia, despot Stefan ≈†tiljanoviƒá, and the graves of Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá, Mihailo Obrenoviƒá, Metropolitan Mihailo, Metropolitan Inokentije, Patriarch Gavrilo V, Patriarch Vikentije II, Vuk Karad≈æiƒá, Dositej Obradoviƒá. Patriarchate of the Serbian Orthodox Church The Cathedral Today's Building of the Patriarchate was built from 1934 until 1935 and designed by architect Viktor Lukomski. It is located across Saborna Crkva. The building has a square base, it is solid and has monumental forms. On the main facade, against the cathedral church, an impressive portico stands out, with low columns and an arched portal above which is a sculpted coat of arms of the Serbian Orthodox Church. On the top of this facade, in a niche, is a mosaic composition representing St. John the Baptist. In the east part of the building, there is a chapel dedicated to St. Simeon. It contains a carved iconostasis, the work of Ohrid masters, bearing icons painted in 1935 by Vladimir Predojeviƒá. The Cathedral Church of St. Michael the Archangel was declared Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979, and it is protected by Republic of Serbia. The Library and Museum of Serbian Orthodox Church are in this building, too. Attraction The cathedral is a popular tourist attraction in Belgrade; however, for tourists, it is best to visit the church during weekdays as the church usually holds weddings, baptisms etc. during the weekend.

It centered on Joe, a German Shepherd in the military's K-9 corps, and his master, Sergeant Will Corey (played by Arch Whiting). The show was considered as a cross between Lassie and The Fugitive. Like The Fugitive, and later The Incredible Hulk, it centered on a falsely accused person (in this case, the \\"person\\" was a dog) running from authorities and helping people it meets along the way. The show was produced by D'Angelo Productions, which also produced the NBC young adult drama Westwind, and other live-action series for Saturday mornings. Plot One day, during training, Joe was falsely accused of attacking his master, a crime for which the dog would be euthanised as punishment. However, the dog escaped before being killed and a $200 bounty was put on its head. Sgt. Corey believed Joe was innocent and joined the pursuit, hoping to find Joe before the authorities did. During the show's second season, Sgt. Corey, having never found Joe (although he always came close), was called back to duty. Joe then teamed with a hiker, Josh McCoy (played by Chad States), and continued to help others, all the while still on the run.

At the close of voting, it had received 13 points, placing 19th in a field of 22. The song is a mid-tempo love ballad, with Ingeborg explaining to her lover that she \\"never feel[s] lost\\" as a result of him, despite the titular wind. Ingeborg also recorded the song in English, as \\"Breakaway\\". It was succeeded as Belgian representative in the 1990 Contest by Philippe Lafontaine singing \\"Mac√©domienne\\".

It was developed from a WHO multi-country collaborative study, the items being selected for the AUDIT being the best performing of approximately 150 items including in the original survey. It is widely used as a summary measure of alcohol use and related problems. It has application in primary health care, medical clinics, and hospital units and performs well in these settings. Using different cut-off points, it can also screen for Alcohol Use Disorder (DSM-5) and Alcohol Dependence. Guidelines for the use of the AUDIT have been published by WHO and are available in several languages. It has become a widely used instrument and has been translated into approximately fifty languages. The AUDIT consists of ten questions, all of which ask explicitly about alcohol: # Questions 1 to 3 ask about consumption of alcohol (frequency, quantity or typical drinking occasions, and consumption likely to cause impairment); # Possible dependence on alcohol (Questions 4 to 6), and # Harmful alcohol use, including concern expressed by others (Questions 7 to 10). Each question is scored between 0 and 4 depending on the response and so the total score ranges between 0 and 40. Based on responses in the original WHO multi-centre study a score of 8 or more is the threshold for identifying hazardous or harmful alcohol consumption with a score of 15 or more indicating likely alcohol dependence, and 20 or more indicating likely severe dependence and harm. Using the cut-off point of 8, its performance in the original collaborative WHO study indicated a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 94% for the diagnoses of hazardous and harmful alcohol consumption. The AUDIT was designed to be used internationally, and was derived from a WHO collaborative study drawing patients from six countries, representing different regions of the world and different political and economic systems. More than 300 studies have been undertaken to examine its usefulness and validity in various settings. Multiple studies have found that the AUDIT is a reliable and valid measure in identifying alcohol abuse, hazardous consumption and harmful alcohol use (consumption leading to actual harm) and it has also been found to be a valid indicator for severity of alcohol dependence. There is some evidence that the AUDIT works in adolescents and young adults; it appears less accurate in older adults. It appears well-suited for use with college students, and also with women and members of minority groups. There has also been significant evidence for its use in the trauma patient population to screen for possible alcohol use disorders.In the trauma patient population, AUDIT has been shown to be more effective at identifying possible alcohol abuse than physician judgement and the blood alcohol content (BAC) test. A shorter version of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C) has been created for rapid use, and is composed of the first 3-question of the full length AUDIT pertaining specifically to quantity of alcohol consumed.

These are the boards that regulate the accountancy profession in the United States of America. There is one board for each of the 50 states, plus the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. Structure of the U.S. accounting profession In the United States, the designation of Certified Public Accountant (CPA) is granted at state level. Individual CPAs are not required to belong to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), although many do. NASBA acts primarily as a forum for the state boards themselves, as opposed to AICPA which represents CPAs as individuals. Role of NASBA NASBA's primary role is to: * Act as a forum for state boards to discuss issues of common concern * Encourage reciprocal recognition of the CPA qualification between states * Enable state boards to speak with one voice in dealing with AICPA, the Federal Government, and other stakeholders NASBA is a member of the International Federation of Accountants. Uniform CPA Examination Responsibility for the Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination is shared between state boards of accountancy, the AICPA and NASBA: * State boards of accountancy are responsible for assessing eligibility of candidates to sit for the CPA examination. Boards are also the final authority on communicating exam results received from NASBA to candidates. * The AICPA is responsible for setting and scoring the examination, and transmitting scores to NASBA. * NASBA maintains the National Candidate Database and matches score data received from the AICPA with candidate details. Most states offer online score reporting on NASBA's website at www.nasba.org. NASBA also maintains records for those who have passed the exam. The AICPA and NASBA also coordinate and maintain mutual recognition agreements with foreign accountancy institutes. The only countries with such agreements includeAustralia, Canada, Hong Kong, Ireland, Mexico, Scotland, and New Zealand. Accountants from these countries who meet the specified criteria may be able to sit for the International Qualification Examination (IQEX) as an alternative to the Uniform CPA Exam.

In 1848 he earned his medical doctorate from the University of Giessen, and from 1848 to 1861 served as a military physician with a Hessian troop outfit. During this time he also worked at a small hospital in Darmstadt that he co-founded. In 1861 at the request of Carl Friedrich Strempel (1800-1872), he was appointed professor at the University of Rostock and director of the surgical clinic. In 1867 he succeeded Karl Otto Weber (1827-1867) at the University of Heidelberg. During the Franco-Prussian War he served as a physician in reserve hospitals. Simon was a member of the Corps Starkenburgia Giessen (1843) and Saxo-Borussia Heidelberg (1845). Simon specialized in the fields of gynecology, orthopedics and military surgery, and published a book involving his early experiences with gunshot wounds. In 1851-52 while in Paris, he had the chance to observe Antoine Joseph Jobert de Lamballe‚Äôs operative treatment of vesicovaginal fistulae (VVF). Impressed by Jobert's success rate with VVF, Simon developed his own surgical technique for VVF when he returned to Darmstadt. Simon demonstrated that the excretion process remains functional in animals with one healthy kidney, and on 2 August 1869 performed the first planned nephrectomy on a human, only eight years after the first nephrectomy by Erastus Bradley Wolcott. In 1872 with Bernhard von Langenbeck (1810-1887) and Richard von Volkmann (1830-1889), he founded the German Society of Surgery.

Developed by Incentive Software and published by Domark, it was released in 1991 on multiple platforms. The game originally retailed for ¬£24.99 for the 8-bit version, and ¬£49.99 for 16-bit version, in the United Kingdom. A sequel, 3D Construction Kit II, was released in 1992, but only available on Amiga, Atari ST and MS-DOS. Features Church created using 3D Construction Kit Incentive Software had released games using the Freescape engine before, but with 3D Construction Kit, the company took the concept to a whole new level, giving users the ability to create their own worlds and games. In 3D Construction Kit, interaction with the world is usually limited to a cursor controlled with the keyboard, offering the possibility of interaction with nearby objects. The kit has a very simple graphical user interface, allowing users to create and manipulate objects within the game's 3D environment. Primitives such as cubes, cuboids and pyramids can be easily created and edited to be scaled and placed on the 3D world. Colours can be selected for individual elements, making the free roaming worlds more varied and complex. The user-created virtual world is divided into areas, reducing the processing power required to render objects. The areas can be as large as the memory allows. Animations may also be added to the primitives, either by looping or simple moving attributes to objects, to create simple, although seemingly advanced, animations. In order to make games rather than worlds, 3D Construction Kit also allows for the addition of conditions, using the very simple-to-program Freescape Command Language (FCL). Sensors, animations and interactivity with the elements can be added with relative ease. Players are able to move around the virtual worlds by walking or flying. Elements such as proximity sensors triggering events, enemies making the player appear in another zone of the game when hit, and the ability to activate switches in order to open doors, make the worlds created with 3D Construction Kit come to life and add a level of uncertainty to the gameplay. The interface of the game is customisable; by adding a 320x200, 16-colour IFF screen created with any image editing program, the games created with this tool could be made to look more professional. Versions 3D Construction Kit was originally released on the ZX Spectrum in early 1991. Later the same year it was adapted for numerous other platforms, including versions for the Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, PC as well as the Commodore 64 and Commodore 128. A version for the Amiga was released on June 1, 1991 and proved relatively popular with computer users. The Acorn Archimedes version3D Construction Kit User Group Fanzine - Issue 5 was released in January 1992. The different versions of the game varied slightly in their user interface, which was progressively improved with each successive release. The 3D Construction Kit packages came with a 30-minute video tape, featuring an introduction and a tutorial presented by Ian Andrew, the original designer of the Freescape system.3D Construction Kit Tutorial VHS Video - YouTube 3D Construction Kit is available in five language editions: English, German, French, Spanish and Italian. Specifics =Freescape Command Language= 3D Construction Kit employs the Freescape Command Language (FCL), which allows functions to be performed when certain conditions occur within the Freescape environment. On 16-bit versions, these commands can be used in any of three places: * Object conditions: executed when some kind of interaction with the specified object takes place * Area conditions: executed each frame while the viewpoint is within the confines of the specified area * General conditions: executed every frame regardless of the viewpoint position. The 8-bit versions do not allow the creation of object conditions, but add procedures ‚Äì conditions that can be executed from general or area conditions but are not otherwise triggered by the game engine. Although the 8-bit and 16-bit versions of the language are similar, they are not interchangeable. =Sound= The 16-bit 3D Construction Kit has a standard sound bank which can store up to 32 sounds. Sounds 0‚Äì6 are predefined. These are: \\"00 Laser out\\", \\"01 Shooter\\", \\"02 Bump\\", \\"03 Explosion\\", \\"04 Ping\\", \\"05 Smash\\" and \\"06 Clang\\". The user can add up to 26 other sounds of their choosing. The 8-bit version has a sound bank of 12 predefined sounds. Reception The ZX Spectrum version was critically acclaimed, receiving 92% from Your Sinclair and a Crash Smash from CRASH. The Commodore 64 version received a 100% rating from Your Commodore. The Amiga version received scores above 90% by three magazines: The One,http://amr.abime.net/review_5303 Amiga Format and Amiga Action.http://amr.abime.net/review_6097 Computer Gaming World was much less positive, warning that the PC version \\"is not for the fainthearted or the boot-up-and-play-without-looking-at-the-manual crowd\\". The magazine criticized the software only providing one large precreated object and the inability to reuse elements from the sample provided game, and stated that \\"the Freescape world itself [is] unsatisfying ... a heartless and barren place ... long abandoned by all forms of life\\". It concluded, \\"Users with no interest in programming are advised to stay well away\\".

It is known from a collection of subfossil bones from the Mare aux Songes swamp, a detailed sketch made by de Jossigny in 1770, a no less detailed description by Desjardins of a bird shot in 1836, and a number of brief reports about owls, the first being those of Van Westzanen in 1602 and Matelief in 1606. Taxonomy Sub-fossil remains, 1893 No descriptions of owls were recorded between the mid-17th and the late 18th century. This led to considerable confusion, especially since the bones were referred to ear tuft-less Strix or barn owls, whereas the image and the description unequivocally show the presence of ear tufts. Thus, it was for a long time believed that 2 or even 3 species of owls occurred on the island. The supposed \\"barn owl\\" Tyto newtoni was described from tarsometatarsus bones of what probably was a male individual of this species, whereas the Mauritius owl's type specimen seems to be a bone of a larger female bird. But the bird was neither a Strix nor a barn owl. Instead, the Mascarene owls of the genus Mascarenotus were most probably members of the scops owl lineage. The Mauritius bird was the largest species of its genus, with a total length of approximately 60 cm. Its scientific name honors Th√©odore Sauzier, who made the first bones available for scientific study. In 2018, a DNA study by Louchart and colleagues found that the Mascarenotus owls grouped among species of Otus (the scops owls), and therefore belonged to that genus. The cladogram below shows the placement of the Mauritius owl: Extinction 1896 illustration by √âmile Oustalet based on Jossigny's drawing The Mauritius owl was the largest carnivore on the island prior to human settlement. Thus, unlike other local species of birds, it was not much affected by the introduction of predators such as cats, rats, and crab-eating macaques. In the 1830s, the species seems to have been not uncommonly found in the southeastern part of the island, between Souillac and the Montagnes Bambous due east of Curepipe, with the last testimony of observations referring to several encounters in 1837. However, as the cultivation of sugarcane and tea encroached upon its habitat, combined with reckless shooting, it disappeared rapidly. In 1859, Clark wrote that the bird was extinct.

John Jay Hall is a 15-story building located on the southeastern extremity of the Morningside Heights campus of Columbia University in the City of New York, on the northwestern corner of 114th St. and Amsterdam Avenue. Named for Founding Father, The Federalist Papers author, diplomat, and first Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court John Jay (Class of 1764), it was among the last buildings designed by the architectural firm of McKim, Mead & White, which had provided Columbia's original Morningside Heights campus plan, and was built from 1925 to 1929. The building includes freshman housing for students of Columbia College and the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science; John Jay Dining Hall, the university's primary undergraduate dining facility; JJ's Place, an underground student quick service restaurant serving burgers and gourmet sandwiches among other things; the university's health services center; and an elegant wood-paneled lounge. Among its most prominent residents was the Spanish poet Federico Garc√≠a Lorca. Unlike Carman Hall, the other exclusively freshman dormitory at Columbia, in which rooms are double-occupancy and arranged in clusters of two around a common bathroom as a suite, John Jay Hall's accommodations consist primarily of single rooms along narrow corridors, generally with 3 double-occupancy rooms per floor. Other dormitories housing undergraduate freshmen (but not exclusively so) include Wallach and Hartley Halls (known as the Living Learning Center, as the two dormitories combine students of all ages and years). Residents of John Jay Hall are treated to spacious floor lounges that boast large flat screen televisions and chairs for lounging. Floor lounges are a perfect spot to hang out with friends, play video games, watch a movie, or even do some homework. Floor lounges also include microwaves and spaces for appliances. In addition to the floor lounges, resident of John Jay are also fortunate to have several single-use bathrooms that each consist of a shower, a sink, and a toilet. The 2 old elevators in John Jay Hall are notoriously the slowest on Columbia campus, and residents are usually frustrated as they don't reach all floors. One elevator reaches up to the 13th floor, and the other reaches up to the 14th floor. The penthouses on the 15th floor have no elevator access, and that floor also is without a lounge. The main lounge of the dormitory was recently renovated and holds a large grand piano as well as older dark wood paneling. History =\\"Skyscraper Dorm\\"= Following the First World War, significantly expanded enrollment at Columbia, combined with skyrocketing rents in Morningside Heights, not to mention the rest of New York City, prompted the construction of new dormitories at Columbia. Such a pressing need required a substantial expansion in housing space, and John Jay, the newest building for Columbia men (Columbia College, and consequently the dormitories it used, did not become co-educational until 1983) was built to nearly double the height of preexisting dormitories. John Jay Hall was notably distinct from its institutional contemporaries on Morningside Heights. Johnson (now Wien) and Hewitt Halls were built to house female Columbia graduate students and Barnard College undergraduates, respectively. Both employed lighter wood finishing and \\"early-American\\" neo-colonial architecture, thought to reflect the comfortable, domestic environment women ought to be exposed to. In contrast, John Jay Hall featured dark wooden ceiling beams and panelling, as well as other details thought to render it a more \\"masculine\\" structure. In his 1919 annual report, University President Nicholas Murray Butler wrote that the new dorm would \\"make provision for student life and student organizations which are so important a part of the total educational influence that the university, and particularly the College, exerts.\\" Originally known simply as Students Hall, the building therefore incorporated features, such as the dining hall and rathskeller (the Lion's Den Grill, now JJ's Place), as well as student club space on the fourth floor, meant to foster on-campus student life. It rapidly became the center of undergraduate life, housing the offices of campus publications such as the Jester and the Columbia Daily Spectator. As humanist writer and Trappist monk Thomas Merton wrote of his Columbia experiences in The Seven Storey Mountain, \\"The fourth floor of John Jay Hall was the place where all the offices of the student publications, the Glee Club and the Student Board and all the rest were to be found. It was the noisiest and most agitated part of campus.\\" John Jay also came to house dances, alumni receptions, and the holiday Yule Log lighting ceremony. The first residents of what the New York Times had deemed the \\"Skyscraper Dorm,\\" however, were agitated by its unreliable elevator service. Their irritation was expressed in a Times story headlined \\"Stair-climbing Stirs Columbia Students\\". Graffiti on one elevator noted \\"a fellow dropped dead from old age waiting for this elevator\\". Elevator service in the building remains faulty to this day. =U.S.S. John Jay= During the Second World War John Jay served as quarters for U.S. Navy midshipmen, and was run, for training purposes, as if it were a naval ship, referred to as the \\"U.S.S. John Jay\\". When midshipman desired to enter the building, he would have to say to their superiors \\"request your permission to come aboard, sir.\\" =1967 Protest= John Jay Hall was the site of violent anti-Vietnam War protest led by the vice-chairman of the Columbia University Chapter of the SDS, Ted Gold. Over 300 protesters followed Gold into the lobby of John Jay, where they confronted the recruiting efforts the U.S. Marines had mounted there. After the protesters came under attack by right-wing students, Gold urged a retreat in order to avoid further conflict. After regrouping at the West End bar near campus, sociology professor and SDS professor Vernon Dibble invoked the skirmish inside the building to rally the dejected students. \\"You let them push you out of John Jay Hall today. You have to go back there again tomorrow to keep your credibility as a radical student group,\\" he insisted. The scuffle in John Jay Hall induced University President Grayson L. Kirk to issue a statement of new school policy: \\"Picketing or demonstrations may not be conducted within any University Building.\\" Nevertheless, the 1967 events in John Jay were merely the precursor to the much larger crisis surrounding the protests of 1968, in which many other buildings were occupied by striking students. Notable residents The following is an incomplete list. *Federico Garc√≠a Lorca (1929-1930), Spanish poet, wrote that ‚Äúmy room in John Jay is wonderful. It is on the 12th floor of the dormitory, and I can see all the university buildings, the Hudson River and a distant vista of white and pink skyscrapers.

From September 2008 to 31 December 2009, the overall military commander in Iraq was General Raymond T. Odierno, Commander, Multi-National Force - Iraq (MNF-I) who reported to United States Central Command. MNF-I replaced Combined Joint Task Force 7 in May 2004. MNF-I consisted of Multi-National Corps - Iraq, Multi-National Security Transition Command - Iraq (MNSTC-I), and the Joint Contracting Command, Iraq/Afghanistan (JCCIA). On January 1, 2010, Multi-National Force Iraq became United States Forces - Iraq. A U.S. Army officer from the 82nd Airborne Division in March 2009.

Special Operations Task Forces  There is a distinction in U.S. military terms between the troops of Multinational Force- Iraq and forces which fall directly under CENTCOM's control but are in Iraq also. There are two special operations task forces operating in Iraq, Task Force 77 and CJSOTF-AP. Though TF 77, a 'black' force, does not answer to MNF- Iraq, it is included here for the sake of completeness of the U.S. forces operating within Iraq. TF 77 was under the command of the Joint Special Operations Command and its principal mission was to hunt down the leaders of al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI).Army Times, SF presence may grow in combat areas, February 2008 *Task Force 77‚ÄîLSA Anaconda, BaladSean Naylor, Closing in on Zarqawi, Army Times, May 8, 2006 **TF North/unidentified battalion 75th Ranger Regiment‚Äîunknown location, northern Iraq **TF West/unidentified element, DEVGRU‚Äîunknown location, western Iraq **TF Center/unidentified squadron, 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment - Delta‚ÄîLSA Anaconda **TF Black/unidentified squadron, 22nd Special Air Service, Baghdad and Basra areaThomas Harding, SAS trooper shot dead in al-Qa'eda raid, The Telegraph, March 27, 2008 The second force, which appears to be separate from TF 77, is the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-Arabian Peninsula (CJSOTF- AP). CJSOTF-AP is a \\"white\\", or unclassified, special operations task force that as of 2008 was always organized around the headquarters of either 5th Special Forces Group or 10th Special Forces Group.SF presence may grow in combat areas, 2008 Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-Arabian Peninsula (CJSOTF-AP), itself answers to Special Operations Command Central.  Order of battle as of 2009 Unless otherwise noted, all units were U.S. in origin. This order of battle extends to battalion level and lists maneuver units only; artillery, support, special operations, and advisory units are not listed. Many brigade combat teams (BCTs) lent battalions to other BCTs during the course of their deployments, giving them \\"operational control\\" of those units. In such cases, the battalion's name is followed by \\"OPCON.\\" Many higher-echelon units have two or more designations, often the formal unit around which the formation is based and then the name of the provisional task force; in these cases, both names are included, separated by a slash. Units were stationed at a variety of bases, including Forward Operating Bases (FOB), Contingency Operating Bases (COB) and Joint Security Stations (JSS). =Multi- National Corps - Iraq= (General Raymond Odierno)‚ÄîCamp Victory, Baghdad *Multi-National Corps Iraq/I Corps (Lieutenant General Charles H.

United States naval forces in Iraq The U.S. Navy Riverine Squadrons of the U.S. Navy are elements of the Navy Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC) that have taken active part in the land operations in support of the army and Marine units. According to the Navy: \\"The Navy's Riverine force focuses on conducting Maritime Security Operations and Theater Security Cooperation in a riverine area of operations or other suitable area. The force is capable of combating enemy riverine forces by applying fires directly, or by coordinating supporting fires. It will share battle space with the other Services in an effort to close the seams in Doctrine, Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures, and Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance.\\"U.S. Navy Expeditionary Combat Command: ‚ÄúRiverine: About Us‚Äù As of 2008, three riverine squadrons were active in the U.S. Navy, all under the command of Riverine Group 1, located in Norfolk, Virginia.

Lowry was active in the International Federation of Wargaming in the late 1960s and ran a mail order business called \\"Lowry's Hobbies\\" with his wife Julie. In 1970 he produced a supplement to the Avalon Hill game Battle of the Bulge called Operation Greif which was distributed via the IFW newsletter. In 1971 he started a publishing imprint called Guidon Games which produced rulebooks for miniature wargaming and board wargames, and he tapped Gary Gygax to serve as editor. Lowry designed two of the games, Ironclad and Atlanta, himself and provided the illustrations for some of the other games. Lowry's mail order business was originally in Evansville, Indiana, but he relocated to Belfast, Maine in 1972. The same year he acquired Panzerfaust Magazine from Don Greenwood and took over as editor. Lowry declined to publish Dungeons & Dragons, which motivated Gygax to found TSR, Inc.. TSR would republish some of the Guidon titles, and the Guidon board game Alexander the Great was picked up by Avalon Hill.

Career Corne Krige was born on 21 March 1975 in Lusaka, Zambia and his parents still reside in that country. He was schooled in South Africa at Paarl Boys' High School, about 60 km from Cape Town. He played most of his rugby for South African teams, and resides there. Krige's Test debut came in 1999 after recovering from career- threatening knee and hand injuries. He captained the Springboks on his test debut in a 101‚Äì0 victory over Italy in Durban; two weeks later he suffered another serious knee injury against the All Blacks in Dunedin which ended his hopes of captaining the Springboks at the 1999 Rugby World Cup in Wales.

Known for aggressive style of play, Krige was the subject of controversy after the November 2002 Test against England at Twickenham that saw England hand the Boks the worst defeat in their history (53‚Äì3). During the match, an increasingly frustrated South Africa side began targeting England players with physical off-the-ball attacks, and match footage showed Krige as the leader. He later admitted in his autobiography that he had lost control as South Africa had gone into the match on the back of two defeats and that he had intentionally fouled the England players. His Super Rugby career then ended several weeks early when he was handed an eight- week ban for head-butting an opponent in 2004. He finished his career in the English Premiership with Northampton Saints, signing for the 2004‚Äì05 season. He retired at the end of that season and returned to Cape Town to pursue business interests.\\"Saints star Krige to quit playing\\", BBC, 10 February 2005.

SMADs are transcription factors that transduce extracellular TGF-Œ≤ superfamily ligand signaling from cell membrane bound TGF-Œ≤ receptors into the nucleus where they activate transcription TGF-Œ≤ target genes. R-SMADS are directly phosphorylated on their c-terminus by type 1 TGF-Œ≤ receptors through their intracellular kinase domain, leading to r-SMAD activation. R-SMADS include SMAD2 and SMAD3 from the TGF-Œ≤/Activin/Nodal branch, and SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8 from the BMP/GDP branch of TGF-Œ≤ signaling. In response to signals by the TGF-Œ≤ superfamily of ligands these proteins associate with receptor kinases and are phosphorylated at an SSXS motif at their extreme C-terminus. These proteins then typically bind to the common mediator Smad or co-SMAD SMAD4. Smad complexes then accumulate in the cell nucleus where they regulate transcription of specific target genes: * SMAD2 and SMAD3 are activated in response to TGF-Œ≤/Activin or Nodal signals. * SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8 are activated in response to BMPs bone morphogenetic protein or GDP signals.

In 1991, after moving to Huntington Beach, California, Dean Torrence helped convince elected officials that the town be officially nicknamed Surf City, USA. In 2006, the official trademark of \\"Surf City, USA\\" was granted to Huntington Beach after several back-and-forth lawsuits between Huntington Beach and Santa Cruz. As of 2009, more than 65 businesses in the city included \\"Surf City\\" as part of their name. Jan and Dean version The first draft of the song, with the working title \\"Goody Connie Won't You Come Back Home\\", was written by Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys. While at a party with Jan Berry and Dean Torrence, Wilson played them \\"Surfin' U.S.A.\\" on the piano. Berry and Torrence suggested that they do the song as a single, but Wilson refused, as \\"Surfin' U.S.A.\\" was intended for the Beach Boys. Wilson then suggested that the duo record \\"Surf City\\" instead, demoing the opening, verse, and chorus. Wilson had lost interest in the song and believed he was never going to complete it himself. Berry later contributed additional writing to the song, while Torrence also contributed several phrases, but never insisted that he be given writing credit. Hal Blaine, Glen Campbell, Earl Palmer, Bill Pitman, Ray Pohlman and Billy Strange are identified as players for the single per the American Federation of Musicians contract. Released in May 1963, two months later it became the first surf song to reach number one on national record charts, remaining at the top of Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks. The single crossed over to the Billboard R&B; Chart where it peaked at number 3. It also charted in the UK, reaching number 26.UK Official Charts Archive, 21 August 1963 Before the single, Jan and Dean made music which was largely inspired by East Coast black vocal group records. The success of \\"Surf City\\" gave them a unique sound and identity which would be followed by five more top ten hits inspired by Los Angeles surf or hot rod life. The Beach Boys' manager and Wilson's father Murry was reportedly irate about the song, believing that Brian had wasted a number one record which could have gone to his group, the Beach Boys. Brian later told Teen Beat, \\"I was proud of the fact that another group had had a number 1 track with a song I had written ... But dad would hear none of it. ...

The archetype was first identified by film critic Naomi Wise in 1971. Characteristics The Hawksian woman is up- front in speaking her mind and keeping up with her male counterparts in witty banter as well as taking action to get what she wants personally as well as sexually. She can be seen as the fast-talker, frank, and can beat a man in verbal sparring.\\"Fast-Talking Dames by Maria Dibattista.\\" . Despite his preference for this kind of woman, Hawks never considered himself a feminist and simply stated that he thought these women were lively and interesting both in films and in life.

It is believed that Lauren Bacall was the perfect woman for Hawks. In Keith's book it states \\"Howard had been working on this formula woman for years in his films. Rather, it was that, until he met me, the woman of his dreams was only in his head. And until Howard got to Betty Bacall, there hadn‚Äôt been an actress to make that dream come alive on screen.\\" Hawks' first film, A Girl in Every Port, exhibited the start of the female lead's formula, in which Louise Brooks was directed as the very first Hawksian Woman .Hagopian, Kevin. \\"Film Notes ‚Äì A Girl in Every Port.\\" Albany.edu. Accessed September 12, 2013. . A later example of a Hawksian woman would be Barbara Stanwyck's character in Ball of Fire, in which she plays Sugarpuss O'Shea, alongside Gary Cooper. Hawksian women would work under Hawks' direction with exclusive contracts, using an actress like Lauren Bacall just twice a year to make the public want them more.\\"The Miami News ‚Äì Google News Archive Search.\\" Accessed September 13, 2013. . The Hawksian woman plays across general female role expectations for the setting, defining herself and her choices and leading action. This albeit on masculine terms as denoted by being known, like the male protagonists, by nickname rather than forename. This makes the Hawksian woman especially different from other female archetypes of the time, in that she is considered \\"one of the gang\\" rather than an object of sexual desire. She can hold her own in a wit-driven argument, have the same profession as her male counterpart, and keep her cool under stress. The equality given to the Hawksian woman by the director, however, does not detract from her feminine qualities, such as seductiveness and softness. The strength of the Hawksian woman often brings out the more masculine qualities of an otherwise quiet and timid male lead. Typically Hawksian women came from either the aristocracy and learned to appreciate their working-man's ideals, or were hard-working professionals themselves who fought for the good of the common man. Hawks discussed his preference for this kind of woman in some detail with Joseph McBride, taking up a full chapter of Hawks on Hawks (1982). Angie Dickinson as \\"Feathers\\", opposite John Wayne (\\"Chance\\") in Hawks' Rio Bravo (1959). Hawksian women would be tailored in well-cut, sporty styles, that were attractive yet down to earth. Physically Hawksian women are not all classic beauties, but rather, are carried more by their spunk and charisma than their physical features. Decline According to some film critics, the Hawksian woman slowly faded from Hollywood in the 1950s, as a new archetype for female leads came to the screen.Greer, Germaine. \\"Siren Song.\\" The Guardian, December 29, 2006. . World War II had ended, and the role of women in society had changed. Germaine Greer describes this archetype as the 'Female Eunuch', powerless women often portrayed by actresses like Marilyn Monroe and Catherine Deneuve. Influence John Carpenter, an avowed Hawks fan, includes Hawksian women in most of his movies, from Assault on Precinct 13 through Ghosts of Mars. Examples of Hawksian women in Carpenter's films include the characters played by Karen Allen in Starman and Adrienne Barbeau in The Fog and Escape from New York (the latter was also his real-life wife at the time). In a May 2000 profile of actress Cameron Diaz in The New York Times, journalist Dave Kehr remarked that Diaz \\"would have fit marvelously well into the tradition of the Hawksian woman, with her sense of fun, camaraderie and forthright sexuality.\\" See also * Screwball comedy film * Flapper * Femme fatale References Category:Feminism and society Category:Feminism and the arts Category:Female characters in film Category:Film noir Category:Female stock characters ","title":"Hawksian woman"},{"id":"5689287","text":"Ernst Simon Ernst Akiba/Akiva Simon (; March 15, 1900 in Berlin ‚Äì August 18, 1988 in Jerusalem) was a German-Jewish educator and religious philosopher.

Green falls in love with his assistant's widow, Ganja (Clark), who learns Green's dark secret. It is one of only two films in which the lead role was played by Duane Jones, best known for starring in the 1968 film Night of the Living Dead (though he had bit parts in other movies). The film was screened at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival.Harris, Brandon. \\"Bill Gunn Surfaces at BAM.\\" Filmmaker Magazine. 31 Mar. 2010. Retrieved 18 February 2011. It was remade by Spike Lee in 2014 as Da Sweet Blood of Jesus. Plot The film follows Dr. Hess Green (Duane Jones), a wealthy black anthropologist who is doing research on the Myrthians, an ancient African nation of blood drinkers. One night, while staying in Green's lavish mansion, richly decorated with African art, his unstable assistant George Meda (Bill Gunn) threatens suicide. Green successfully talks him down, but later that night Meda attacks and stabs Green with a Myrthian ceremonial dagger, and then kills himself. Green survives, but on discovering the body, drinks Meda's blood; he has become a vampire endowed with immortality and a need for fresh blood. He steals several bags of blood from a doctor's office, but finds that he needs fresh victims. Soon, Meda's estranged wife, Ganja Meda (Marlene Clark), arrives at Green's house searching for her husband. Green and Meda quickly become lovers, and she moves into Green's mansion. When she unwittingly discovers her husband's corpse frozen in Green's wine cellar she is initially upset, but then agrees to marry her host, who turns her into a vampire as well. Ganja is initially horrified by her new existence, but Green teaches her how to survive. Soon he brings home a young man whom Ganja seduces and then kills. The two vampires dispose of the body in the water. Eventually, Green becomes disillusioned with this life and resolves to return to the Christian church headed by his chauffeur, Reverend Luther Williams (Sam Waymon). Returning home, he kills himself by standing in front of a cross. Ganja, though saddened by his death, lives on, presumably continuing her vampiric lifestyle. The film ends with the young man Ganja had earlier killed rising out of the water, naked but alive, and running toward her.

Introduction to The Letters of William Gaddis. Ed. Steven Moore. Champaign, IL: Dalkey Archive Press, 2013. 9. Production In 1972, independent production company Kelly-Jordan Enterprises approached William Gunn, a black artist known at the time as a playwright and stage director, with the idea of making a \\"black vampire film\\" with a budget of $350,000. Though Gunn later told a friend, \\"The last thing I want to do is make a black vampire film,\\" he accepted the project with the intention of using vampirism as metaphor for addiction. The producers' relative inexperience at filmmaking afforded Gunn a high degree of creative control over the film. Filming occurred at Apple Bee Farms (Croton-on-Hudson, New York) and the Brooklyn Museum in New York City. The film had its premiere in 1973 and was selected for the Critics' Week at the Cannes Film Festival that year. Reception The movie received positive reviews. It was screened at the 12th International Critics' Week at Cannes Film Festival, and James Murray of the Amsterdam News hailed it as \\"the most important Black produced film since Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song.\\" Writing in 2014, critic Scott Foundas described the film as a \\"landmark 1973 indie that used vampirism as an ingenious metaphor for black assimilation, white cultural imperialism and the hypocrisies of organized religion.\\" Recut version The film's producers, Kelly and Jordan, were discouraged by the poor box office numbers and unhappy with the film's unusual structure and style. Kelly-Jordan took the film out of distribution and sold it to another company, Heritage Enterprises, which issued a rescored and drastically recut version under the title Blood Couple. This version (disowned by Gunn) was released on VHS under various titles. Despite Heritage Enterprises' compromised release, the original cut was donated to the Museum of Modern Art, whose screenings, according to writer Chris Fujiwara, \\"helped build [the film's] reputation as a neglected classic of independent African American cinema.\\"  Remake  The film was remade by Spike Lee in 2014 as Da Sweet Blood of Jesus. The script is credited to both Lee and Gunn. It has been described as \\"a remake ‚Äî at times scene for scene and shot for shot ‚Äî of Ganja and Hess.\\"  Cultural Impact  Lyrics from Sam Waymon's \\"The Blood of Thing (Part 2) Shadow of the Cross\\", a song that appeared in the film, was sampled by experimental trio Clipping in their song \\"Blood of the Fang\\". The track appeared on the album There Existed an Addiction to Blood, the album title taken from a line in Waylon's original song.

Gigantopterids were among the most advanced land plants of the Paleozoic Era and disappeared soon after the massive Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event . Though some lineages of these plants managed to persist initially, they either disappeared entirely or adapted radically, evolving into undetermined descendants, as surviving life prospered again in much-altered ecosystems. One hypothesisAsama (1982) proposes that at least some \\"gigantopterids\\" became the ancestors of angiosperms and/or Bennettitales and/or Caytoniales.Miller (2007) Gigantopterid fossils were documented as early as 1883, but only investigated more thoroughly in the early 20th century. Some of their most significant evidence was initially found in Texas, but they might have been present worldwide. Another key region for gigantopterid fossils is in China, and the consolidation of all major continents into Pangea would have allowed for easy global dispersal. They were among the most striking and important plants of the Cathaysian flora of Sino-Malaya, also called Gigantopteris flora to reflect this.Wang (1999) Description They bore many of the traits of flowering plants, but are not known to have flowered themselves. Gigantopterid plants had simple, bilaterally symmetrical leaf structures, woody stems and spines. They grew new parts by producing shoots, like flowering plants. Judging from the fossil remains, they were probably robust plants with fronds that resembled fern fronds when young. When mature they were more like flowering plant leaves with reticulate venation arranged in a frond. Gigantopteris nicotianaefolia for example is named thus because each of its leaflets resembles a tobacco leaf in shape. They grew at least over 20 cm (around 10 in), probably over 50 cm (20 in) tall, depending on whether it grew as a scrambling vine (the initial assumption) or erect (nowadays considered more likely). Some apparently preferred wetlands, while others throve in rather arid habitat.Wang (1999), Glasspool et al. (2004) The vascular tissue contains vessel elements and in at least some taxa resembles that of the Gnetophyta. They had a cuticula similar to that of other seed plants. Some male sporangia (Gigantotheca) and seeds (Gigantonomia, Cornucarpus) have been tentatively referred to this group.Li & Yao (1983) While the sporangia are certainly not flowers, they differ from other sporangia of Permian plants. Chemical analysis of fossil remains indicates that gigantopterids produced oleananes, chemical compounds otherwise known to be used by flowering plants, for which they function as a suppressant of insect pests. They are apparently also found in certain modern ferns however. Systematics It is probable that the gigantopterids are a non-monophyletic form taxon. Plant life from their era is very difficult to document and organize. They have been variously allied with the \\"seed ferns\\" (another paraphyletic group of early seed plants) Peltaspermales and Callistophytales, Gnetum, and the Magnoliophyta. All that can be said at present is that they were spermatophytes. It is also highly unlikely that they were close relatives of gymnosperms, cycads or ginkgos, because these lineages were already established and distinct in the Late Permian. Vegetative leaves of Emplectopteris were at one time included in this group. However, they had ovules attached to the underside of the fronds and are now placed in their own family (Emplectopteridaceae) within the Callistophytales. Some prefer to refer to the presumed \\"core\\" taxa of this group as Gigantonomiales.Meyen (1987) However, many experts remain skeptical of the new name, because they consider such a move premature until more is known about the interrelationships of the genera of \\"gigantopterids\\" and the relationships of these to other plants. Several genera have been named. Those then known were assigned to a family Gigantopteridaceae and numerous subfamilies by Gen-ichi Koidzumi.Koidzumi (1936) It appears as if at least some of his divisions ought to prove useful when a more definite phylogenetic, systematic and taxonomic arrangement for this group is eventually found. On the other hand, the Gigantopteridaceae would with near certainty have to be more narrowly circumscribed even if the Gigantopteridales are by and large verified as a clade; they might even become limited to the two or so genera now placed in the Gigantopteridieae.Glasspool et al.

Plot Laurel and Hardy establish an electrical goods store next door to Charlie Hall's grocery store. Hall, still sulking and suspicious from their previous encounter with the liquor-spiked well water in Them Thar Hills, mistakenly thinks that Hardy is trying to romance his wife (Mae Busch). Angered by that misperception, he destroys a few items in Stan and Ollie's shop. The two business partners now leave their shop, without closing its door, to retaliate in Hall's grocery. While they wreak havoc there, a shoplifter (Bobby Dunn) removes items from their electrical store, later taking more and more as their confrontations with Hall escalate. At first the thief openly carries items out by hand; but since Stan and Ollie are distracted by their conflicts with Hall and largely ignore him, the shoplifter begins using a wheelbarrow to take away merchandise. A policeman finally arrives and halts all the personal assaults and retaliations, so Laurel and Hardy return to their store and find it virtually empty. The shoplifter has returned yet again, although this time with a large truck to haul away all the remaining items. As Stan and Ollie watch in silent disbelief, the shoplifter greets them cheerfully and strolls out of their store carrying a lamp, which he puts in the back of the truck.

The following is an overview of the various titles and formats relating towards NBC Sports' NFL pre-game coverage. History =GrandStand (1975‚Äì1976) = NBC's first official NFL pre-game show was GrandStand, a program that doubled as a competing sports anthology series to ABC's Wide World of Sports during the off-season (GrandStand also served as the pre-game show for NBC's Major League Baseball Game of the Week during the 1976 season). GrandStand premiered in 1975 with hosts Jack Buck and Bryant Gumbel (who joined Buck sometime later in the season). Prior to 1975, NBC would air the political talk show Meet the Press in the NFL pre-game show's timeslot (12:30 p.m. Eastern Time). In 1976, Jack Buck left GrandStand in order to return to the booth as a play-by-play announcer, remaining with NBC. He was replaced as co-host by Lee Leonard. Leonard (who would later become a co-host of ESPN's SportsCenter) left the program in 1977, and was replaced by Mike Adamle and Regina Haskins as Gumbel's co-hosts. For the post-game show, GrandStand kept the Sperry NFL Report, although later incarnations of the post-game would be retitled the Budweiser NFL Report. =NFL (1977‚Äì1986)= In 1977, NBC dropped the GrandStand moniker in favor of NFL, which the title being paired with a year number that corresponded to the then-current NFL season (such as NFL '77 and NFL '78). Beginning with NFL '80, NBC would pioneer the use of in-game highlight packages (\\"Let's go to New York for an NFL '80 update\\") NBC would use this particular method of titling their pregame show until the 1987 season. Bryant Gumbel hosted the NFL on NBC pregame show through the 1981 season, when he left NBC Sports to become co-anchor of NBC's morning program Today. In his final two seasons on The NFL on NBC, Gumbel served as the sole host for the pre-game show. Gumbel was subsequently replaced by Len Berman, who was joined by Adamle, Pete Axthelm (who left following the 1985 season) and Ahmad RashƒÅd. For Berman's second season (and what turned out to be his final full season) as host, Bill Macatee (who left following the 1984 season) and Dave Marash (who left following the 1983 season) replaced Mike Adamle and Ahmad RashƒÅd. RashƒÅd would return to the pre-game show in 1984 and continue onward through the 1988 season. In October 1984, NBC was also covering the World Series between the Detroit Tigers and San Diego Padres. Even though Game 5 was on a Sunday afternoon (Game 5 was at 4:30 p.m. ET), Bob Costas (who anchored NBC's World Series coverage with Len Berman) was still in New York City to host NFL '84. At the end of the pre-game show, Costas left the New York studio to travel to Detroit to cover that night's baseball game at Tiger Stadium. In the meantime, Macatee filled-in for Costas, providing updates and halftime highlights. Costas later interviewed the Tigers in their locker room that night. In 1985, NBC moved its Sunday pre-game show to 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time no matter what time that market got a game. CBS followed suit in 1986. Previously, NBC and CBS would air their pre-game shows at 1:30 and 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time for markets that were only receiving games with 2:00 or 4:00 p.m. Eastern start times. From the mid-to-late 1980s, NBC would to open its NFL pre-game show with a feature called \\"Great Games, Great Moments,\\" which rebroadcast an original clip (from an NBC telecast, as opposed to NFL Films) of a play from a classic NFL game originally televised on the network. The instrumental music that NBC used for the \\"Great Games, Great Moments\\" clip was \\"Constant Energy\\" by Craig Palmer. During the 1986 season, NBC experimented with using a studio audience for its NFL '86 telecasts; this would be dropped after that season. Paul Maguire served as an analyst from 1986 to 1987, alongside Costas and RashƒÅd. =NFL Live! (1987‚Äì1994)= 1987‚Äì1988 In 1987, the network's pre-game show was retitled NFL Live! (a title that would later be used by ESPN for the NFL analysis program previously titled NFL 2Night ‚Äì although without the exclamation point ‚Äì in 2003, six years after NBC lost the broadcast rights to the league's American Football Conference to CBS). Gayle Gardner would join the team as an analyst in 1988, alongside Costas and RashƒÅd. Also in 1988, Costas' predecessor, Len Berman temporarily returned as the program's host as Costas was covering that year's Summer Olympics in Seoul for NBC. Gayle Sierens, who made history as the first female play-by-play announcer in NFL history one year earlier, would join Berman while Costas, RashƒÅd and Gardner were in Seoul. Paul Maguire also briefly returned to NFL Live! (he had earlier left the program to become a color commentator for NBC) during the Olympics period. 1989‚Äì1993 For the 1989 season, O. J. Simpson became an analyst for NFL Live! alongside Costas; Simpson remained on the program until the end of the 1993 season. (Simpson was arrested on two counts of murder on June 17, 1994 and remained incarcerated until his acquittal on October 3, 1995.) That year, the program introduced the John Tesh-composed theme \\"Gridiron Dreams\\". In 1990, Will McDonough moved over from CBS' The NFL Today to join NFL Live! He would leave the program after the 1993 season to serve as a sideline reporter and host of the program's \\"News and Notes\\" segment. In 1991, Bill Parcells (who left after just one season for a role as an in-booth analyst for NBC) joined the team. For Week 1 of the 1991 season, Marv Albert substituted as host of NFL Live!. Regular host Bob Costas along with O. J. Simpson, play-by-play broadcaster Tom Hammond and analyst Todd Christensen were assigned to cover the world track and field championships in Tokyo, Japan. Bob Costas held the main hosting position through the 1992 season, but would continue his involvement with The NFL on NBC, albeit in a more limited role such as delivering pre-taped, one-on-one interviews. Jim Lampley replaced Costas as the host of NFL Live! in 1993, before leaving the program in favor of becoming a play-by-play announcer for NBC's NFL telecasts. Mike Ditka also joined NFL Live! as a regular commentator that year. For the 1993 season, \\"Gridiron Dreams\\" was replaced as the program's theme music by a composition composed by John Colby. 1994‚Äì1997 From 1994 to 1997, former NFL Today host Greg Gumbel served as the program's host, alongside Ahmad RashƒÅd. Meanwhile, a revamped version of John Colby's theme music was used solely for that season. That year, Joe Gibbs joined NFL Live! as an analyst, staying on through the 1997 season. In 1994 and 1995, NBC ran an hour-long edition of the pre-game show before Week 1. Ditka left the program after the 1996 season. =The NFL on NBC (1995‚Äì1997)= During NBC's last three years as the broadcast television home of the American Football Conference (from the 1995 to 1997 seasons), the pregame show was simply titled The NFL on NBC. The theme music by Randy Edelman was used for both the pregame show and the network's game coverage. In 1995, Joe Montana joined the program as an analyst, but left after just one season. Montana was subsequently replaced by Cris Collinsworth, who stayed on through the 1997 season. As previously mentioned, Mike Ditka left NBC following the 1996 season to become the head coach of the New Orleans Saints and was replaced by Sam Wyche. =Football Night in America (2006‚Äìpresent)= After NBC won the rights to the Sunday Night Football package from ESPN, effective with the 2006 season, the network launched the 80-minute pre-game Football Night in America, the only prime time pre-game show on a major broadcast network. The program was initially hosted by Bob Costas. On-air staff See also *The NFL Today *Fox NFL Sunday *Sunday NFL Countdown References External links * Why Aren‚Äôt All NFL Studio Shows This Good?

GPTC is a public corporation owned but not directly controlled by the city. History GPTC bus with bike rack, passing through the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore in Miller Beach. The system started out Gary & Interurban Railway Company, a subsidiary of the Chicago ‚Äì New York Electric Air Line Railroad. Founded in 1908, it operated streetcars and interurban trains throughout Gary and its neighboring suburbs and cities. In 1923, the company was acquired by Samuel Insull's Midland Utilities. By that point, Insull held a virtual monopoly over electrically powered public transit throughout northern Illinois, north Indiana and southwest Wisconsin. However, when Insull's fortunes fell in the wake of the Great Depression, Gary Railways Company was sold off to Chicago & Calumet District Transit Company, which made it a subsidiary. During the 1940s, the streetcar service was gradually replaced with buses. In 1956, the city and interurban buses were split into Gary Transit Inc. and Gary Intercity Lines Inc, respectively. While Gary Intercity Lines ended its services in 1971, Gary Transit lasted until 1975, when it was reorganized into Gary Public Transit Corporation.http://web.me.com/willvdv/chirailfan/histigry.html At that point, Gary Public Transportation Company became the operator of the newly created Hammond Transit System. It was forced to cede the service to Hammond Yellow Coach Lines after a judge determined that the company could not operate a system outside Gary city limits.http://web.me.com/willvdv/chirailfan/histihmd.html GPTC limited its operations to Gary until 1990, when it inaugurated new express bus routes that originated in downtown Gary and reached into Hammond, East Chicago, Merrillville and Crown Point.http://web.me.com/willvdv/chirailfan/histigri.html In 2010, Northwest Indiana Public Development Authority announced that it would not provide GTPC any of the funding it provided over the past few years unless the agency signs a memorandum of understanding that signified its willingness to consolidate its operations under Northwest Indiana Regional Bus Authority. GTPC officials voted against the move on July 2010. The agency was unable to fill the funding gap, forcing it to cut routes and decrease service frequencies. The agency is currently contemplating increasing fares and eliminating Saturday service to make up for the budget shortfall.http://www.post- trib.com/news/lake/2991238,new-gptc1229.article Current system operations Broadway. GPTC primarily serves Gary, with most routes radiating from the Gary Metro Center. GPTC also has express service to locations in Hammond, East Chicago and Merrillville, and its service area includes Crown Point and Hobart as well. Gary Metro Center serves as the system's primary hub - it also doubles as a South Shore Line station, connecting riders to destinations in Chicago and Northern Indiana. Route 13 provides service to Miller South Shore Line station. Route 12 connects to Pace bus routes at Dan Rabin Transit Center. It also connects to several East Chicago Transit routes at Indianapolis Boulevard. Curb to curb pickup is available for disabled citizens. GPTC Bus routes =Local routes= GPTC defines local routes as those bus lines completely within the corporate boundaries of the City of Gary. Many of these services follow routes that were formerly served by streetcar lines when transit was first established in the Gary area. * Route L1: Marshalltown/Tarrytown/Crosstown. This east-west route serves far eastern and far western residential neighborhoods, connecting them to other routes via several transfer points. * Route L2: Oak and County Line. This route serves the Emerson, Aetna and Miller Beach neighborhoods on the east side of Gary. Included on this route are the Miller stop for the South Shore commuter line, downtown Miller Beach, and several public beach areas. * Route L3: West 6th/Hospital - King Drive. This route serves as a central loop connecting downtown to the neighborhoods of Horace Mann, Tolleston, northern Glen Park and Pulaski. * Route L4: University Park. This route serves the northern Glen Park neighborhood of Gary as well as the suburban communities of Merrillville and Hobart. * Route L5: Horace Mann Via Taft St. This route chiefly serves the Horace Mann and West Side neighborhoods. =Regional routes= When the Gary Public Transportation Corporation was created, service outside of the Gary city limits was suspended. In 1992, GPTC returned regional service to Northwest Indiana with the creation of the Tri-City Connection. By 2005, GPTC served five other communities with three regional routes, providing transit to Crown Point, East Chicago, Hammond, Hobart and Merrillville. In 2008, GPTC formed a partnership with Northwest Indiana Regional Bus Authority to increase service on these regional routes, reducing headways on the routes in question. When the partnership ended in the summer of 2010, GPTC to cut down non-rush- hour service back to previous levels. GPTC is currently in the process of applying for another grant to restore the service.http://www.post- trib.com/news/lake/2956260,new-gptc1209.article In February 2010, GPTC created a fourth regional route, University Park. Routes 12 and 17 only stop at specifically designated stops and have higher-than-standard fares. This service has since been replaced by their rapid bus service, the Broadway Metro Express. * Route R1: Lakeshore Connection. This route serves the Central Business Districts of Gary, Hammond and East Chicago. * Route R3: Burr Street & Lake Ridge. This route serves Burr St. and Griffith Plaza in Griffith. * Route R4: Lakeshore South. This route serves south Hammond and Ridge Road in Munster. It was created to fill a void after the RBA ceased operations. This route connects to route R1 and Pace bus routes 350 and 364. It currently runs weekdays only. * Route R5: Merrillville Shuttle.

The majority of the boundary is roughly a straight line from the northwest corner of the state ( NAD27Franklin K. VanZandt, Boundaries of the United States and the Several States, USGS Bulletin 1212, 1966) east to a point in Dracut, just north of Lowell. East of that point, the border is a series of lines about north of the curving Merrimack River, ending in the Atlantic Ocean. History The 1629 charter of the Massachusetts Bay Colony gave the colony the land between the Merrimack River and Charles River. Specifically, the southern border was to be the line of latitude either south of Massachusetts Bay or 3 miles south of the southernmost bend of the Charles River, whichever was farther south. The northern border was to be 3 miles north of the northernmost bend of the Merrimack River. Between these lines of latitude the grant extended from the Atlantic to the Pacific. In 1629 the rivers had not been fully explored and the actual borders of the colony were uncertain. It turned out that the southernmost bend of the Charles is south of the southern curve of Massachusetts Bay. The line of latitude three miles south of the river's southernmost bend, approximately 42¬∞2‚Ä≤ north, forms the basis of the southern border of Massachusetts to the present day. The Merrimack River turned out to originate farther north than expected, flowing south for most of its course and only turning eastward in its last several miles. Thus the 1629 grant gave the colony most of what is today New Hampshire and all of the original 1629 grant that formed the basis of colonial New Hampshire, but it took many decades before this was fully understood. A new charter was granted to the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1691, which merged the Colony with the Colony of New Plymouth, as well as present-day Maine and New Brunswick. The northern boundary of what was now the southern piece remained as defined in 1629. A map showing the rival claims of Massachusetts Bay and New Hampshire The Province of New Hampshire and Province of Massachusetts Bay had disagreements over their mutual boundaries. With respect to the southern boundary of New Hampshire, the two provinces disagreed on the meaning of \\"three miles northward of the Merrimack River, or any part thereof\\". New Hampshire drew a line from three miles north of the mouth of the river, while Massachusetts claimed a line three miles north of the northernmost part of the river, taking its territory far north past what is now Concord, New Hampshire. New Hampshire appealed to King George II, who in 1740 decreed the boundary to run along a curved line three miles from the river between the ocean and a point three miles north of Pawtucket Falls (Lowell), where the river begins to turn north. From there a line was to be drawn due west to meet the western boundary of Massachusetts (fixed in 1773 with the Province of New York). The line actually runs slightly northwest to southeast, so it follows no line of latitude. This gave New Hampshire even more than it had claimed, as Pawtucket Falls was south of the mouth of the Merrimack. At this time, the present northern boundary of Massachusetts was established. The location where these two surveyed lines met (the straight westward line and the curved line following the Merrimack River) was marked by a pine tree called the \\"Old Boundary Pine\\". The tree was marked by George Mitchell, one of the surveyors, on March 21, 1741 to indicate the location where the lines met. The pine tree is long gone, but the point (officially at ) Despite the difference in definitions of the border at this point, there is not a dramatic difference between the two lines at this marker; the Merrimack River itself is flowing roughly east‚Äìwest at Pawtucket Falls. is today marked by a granite monument known as the Boundary Pine Monument, the current form of which was placed in 1890. Elsewhere, the boundary are made by 50 large granite markers, along with several other markers, including a copper bolt set in granite at the tripoint between Vermont, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. The Old Boundary Pine was located east of this point. The \\"curved\\" segments roughly following the course of the Merrimack at a distance 3 miles north of it are not true curves, but rather a series of line segments approximating the curved course of the river. Another granite marker, also placed in 1890, stands on the beach between Salisbury, Massachusetts and Seabrook, New Hampshire at 80 feet from the high tide line, marking the end of the surveyed border, with the border taken to extend into the Atlantic Ocean to the \\"limit of State jurisdiction.\\" New Hampshire claimed all the land west to roughly the present western boundary of Vermont, while New York claimed east to the Connecticut River, Vermont's present eastern boundary; thus both states claimed all of Vermont. A ruling by King George III established the ordinary low-water line on the west bank of the Connecticut River to be the border, but the territory between the Connecticut River and Lake Champlain ‚Äì which had been sold off by New Hampshire ‚Äì declared independence in 1777 as the Vermont Republic. New Hampshire gave up its claim to Vermont with a boundary agreement in 1782, and New York gave up its claim to Vermont, contingent upon Vermont's admission to the Union, in 1790 (Vermont was admitted to the Union in 1791).

It was designed and built from 1926-29 by the Irish architect and furniture designer Eileen Gray. L-shaped and flat-roofed with floor-to-ceiling windows and a spiral stairway to the guest room, E-1027 was both open and compact. This is considered to be Gray's first major work, making indistinct the border between architecture and decoration, and highly personalized to be in accord with the lifestyle of its intended occupants. The name of the house, E-1027, is a code of Eileen Gray and Jean Badovici, 'E' standing for Eileen, '10' Jean, '2' Badovici, '7' Gray. The encoded name was Eileen Gray's way of showing their relationship as lovers at the time when built. It is impossible to identify the exact individual contributions of Gray or Badovici to E-1027. Gray also designed furniture for the house, including a tubular steel table which would enable her sister to eat breakfast in bed without leaving crumbs on sheets, due to an adjustable top that caught the crumbs. Gray and Badovici separated shortly after the completion of the house. Gray began working on a new house, Tempe √† Pailla, in nearby Menton in 1931. Tempe √† Pailla was furnished by Gray with flexible furniture designed to save space. Only a later house designed by Gray, Lou P√©rou in Saint-Tropez, was fully architecturally realized by her. E-1027 and Le Corbusier The Swiss born-French Modernist architect Le Corbusier was a friend of Badovici and visited the house several times after Badovici and Gray had parted. While staying as a guest in the house in 1938 and 1939, Le Corbusier painted bright murals on its plain white walls, and sometimes painted in the nude. This intrusion onto her design infuriated Gray, who considered the murals outright vandalism. Whether he painted these murals out of admiration for her work or jealousy of her accomplishment, Le Corbusier became intricately tied with the future of the house. Failing to purchase it himself, he eventually bought a piece of property just east of E-1027, where he built a small, rustic cabin, his Cabanon de vacances. The architecture critic Rowan Moore said of the painting of the murals that \\"As an act of naked phallocracy, Corbusier's actions are hard to top...\\", adding that Le Corbusier was \\"seemingly affronted that a woman could create such a fine work of modernism\\" so he \\"asserted his dominion, like a urinating dog, over the territory\\". Here he would go for work and quiet contemplation, taking daily swims on the beach outside the house. After he died in those very waters, the whole area was declared a \\"Site Moderne,\\" or \\"Modern Site,\\" and deemed an area of cultural and historical importance and international interest. Today, E-1027 is recognized as the founding element of this site. Furthermore, Eileen Gray was so slow at putting her name forward as being the architect of the house that for many years it was assumed by many historians and journalists that Le Corbusier was in fact its designer. E-1027 today E-1027 is currently undergoing restoration. Gray's original furniture has been removed from the house, and was sold in the early 1990s at the auction house Sotheby's. Replica furniture will be supplied for the house by Zeev Aram, a champion of Gray's work. Plans for its renovation are being prepared by the French government, who have designated it as a French National Cultural Monument. As a result, the state of France and the city of Roquebrune Cap Martin - through the national agency \\"Conservatoire du littoral\\" \\\\- bought the villa in 1999 and made it secure provisionally. A signboard informs that E-1027 will be restored: the restoration is an initiative of the state of France, the department \\"Alpes Maritimes\\" and the city of Roquebrune (expenses to be borne 50% / 10% / 40% respectively). The house is owned by the Conservatoire du littoral, who have delegated responsibility for it to the local commune of Roquebrune-Cap-Martin. It was the wish of Roquebrune-Cap-Martin that the restoration of E-1027 be managed by the architect Renaud Barres, who had previously produced a study on a possible restoration of the house, and that Barres should work with Burkhardt Rukschcio, an architect who had restored modernist buildings. The French Ministry of Culture wished that the restoration be managed by Pierre-Antoine Gatier, the chief architect for historic monuments in the south of France, who had little experience of modern buildings. By 2013 the restoration had cost ‚Ç¨600,000, and was criticised by Barres and Rukschcio who had produced a \\"dossier which details, with convincing photographic evidence, departures from Gray's intent: thickening of metal rails, original glazing and light switches replaced by standard 21st-century products, a stair clumsily misplaced and mis-dimensioned, a colour scheme different from the 1929 version.\\" In 2016, the Getty Foundation contributed a $200,000 grant to the ongoing restoration work.Deborah Vankin (July 26, 2016), Getty Foundation announces 2016 Keeping It Modern grantees Los Angeles Times E-1027 after restoration (2013) corrosion of the frames and of the metal work E-1027 after restoration (2013) one example of many cracked walls Visits are by guided tour only and for groups of no more than 12 persons.

The ship was transferred to the Pacific Squadron shortly after completion and based at Port Arthur from 1901. During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì1905, she participated in the Battle of Port Arthur and was heavily damaged during the Battle of the Yellow Sea. She was sunk by Japanese artillery during the subsequent Siege of Port Arthur in December 1904, but was raised by the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) after the war and renamed Tango (‰∏πÂæå). During World War I, she bombarded German fortifications during the Siege of Tsingtao. The Japanese government sold Tango back to the Russians at their request in 1916. She was renamed Chesma (–ß–µ—Å–º–∞) as her former name had been given to a new ship. En route to the White Sea, she joined an Allied force that persuaded the Greek government to disarm their ships. Her crew declared for the Bolsheviks in October 1917, but made no effort to resist when the British captured her during the North Russia intervention in early 1918. In poor condition, the ship was used as a prison hulk. Abandoned by the British when they withdrew in 1919 and recaptured by the Bolsheviks, she was scrapped in 1924. Design and description The design of the was derived from the battleship , but was greatly enlarged to accommodate an armament of four and eight guns. While under construction their armament was revised to consist of more powerful 12-inch guns and the 8-inch guns were replaced by a dozen guns. The ships were long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . Designed to displace , Poltava was over overweight and displaced when completed. The ship was powered by two vertical triple-expansion steam engines, built by the British firm Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes, each driving one shaft, using steam generated by 14 cylindrical boilers. The engines were rated at and designed to reach a top speed of , but Poltava reached a speed of from during her sea trials. She carried enough coal to give her a range of at a speed of . Her crew consisted of 26‚Äì27 officers and 605‚Äì625 enlisted men. The Petropavlovsk-class ships' main battery consisted of four 12-inch guns mounted in two twin-gun turrets, one forward and one aft of the superstructure. Designed to fire one round per 90 seconds, the actual rate of fire was half that. Their secondary armament consisted of twelve Canet six-inch quick-firing (QF) guns. Eight of these were mounted in four twin-gun wing turrets and the remaining guns were positioned in unprotected embrasures on the sides of the hull amidships. Smaller guns were carried for defense against torpedo boats, including a dozen QF Hotchkiss guns and twenty-eight Maxim QF guns. They were also armed with six torpedo tubes, four tubes above water and two submerged tubes, all mounted on the broadside. They carried 50 mines to be used to protect her anchorage. Poltava was the first Russian battleship to use Krupp cemented armor, imported from Germany. Her waterline armor belt was thick. The Krupp armor of her main gun turrets had a maximum thickness of and the nickel-steel armor of her protective decks ranged from in thickness.  Construction and service  Poltava was named for the victory at the 1709 Battle of Poltava when Peter the Great defeated King Charles XII of Sweden. Delayed by shortages of skilled workmen, design changes and late delivery of the main armament, the ship was under construction for six years. She was laid down on 19 May 1892, together with her two sister ships, at the New Admiralty Shipyard and launched on 6 November 1894. Her trials lasted from 1898 to 1899 and she was then briefly assigned to the Baltic Fleet. Together with her sister ship , Poltava had a radio installed in September 1900, the first ships in the Imperial Russian Navy to get such equipment. On 15 October the sisters set sail for Port Arthur and later had to unload much of their ammunition, coal and other stores to reduce their drafts enough to pass through the Suez Canal. Poltava arrived at Port Arthur on 12 April 1901, the day before her sister. =Battle of Port Arthur= After the Japanese victory in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894‚Äì1895, both Russia and Japan had ambitions to control Manchuria and Korea, resulting in tensions between the two nations. Japan had begun negotiations to reduce the tensions in 1901, but the Russian government was slow and uncertain in its replies because it had not yet decided exactly how to resolve the problems. Japan interpreted this as deliberate prevarication designed to buy time to complete the Russian armament programs. The situation was worsened by Russia's failure to withdraw its troops from Manchuria in October 1903 as promised. The final straws were the news of Russian timber concessions in northern Korea and the Russian refusal to acknowledge Japanese interests in Manchuria while continuing to place conditions on Japanese activities in Korea. These actions caused the Japanese government to decide in December 1903 that war was inevitable. As tensions with Japan increased, the Pacific Squadron began mooring in the outer harbor at night in order to react more quickly to any Japanese attempt to land troops in Korea. On the night of 8/9 February 1904, the IJN launched a surprise attack on the Russian fleet at Port Arthur. Poltava was not hit by the initial attack by torpedo boats and sortied the following morning when the Combined Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç, attacked. T≈çg≈ç had expected the surprise night attack by his ships to be much more successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. The Japanese ships were spotted by the protected cruiser , which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russian defenses. T≈çg≈ç chose to attack the Russian coastal defenses with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns. Splitting his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese and six-inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships, which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect. Poltava was hit several times with little effect and only three men wounded. She fired 12 twelve-inch and 55 six-inch shells during the battle. Poltava participated in the action of 13 April, when T≈çg≈ç successfully lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron, including Vice Admiral Stepan Makarov's flagship, her sister . When Makarov spotted the five Japanese battleships, he turned back for Port Arthur and his flagship struck a minefield laid by the Japanese the previous night. The ship sank in less than two minutes after one of her magazines exploded, and Makarov was one of the 677 killed. Emboldened by his success, T≈çg≈ç resumed long-range bombardment missions, prompting the Russians to lay more minefields, which sank two of his battleships the following month. Rear Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft became the new commander of the First Pacific Squadron and led a half-hearted attempt to reach Vladivostok on 23 June; intercepted by the Combined Fleet, he returned to Port Arthur without engaging the Japanese ships. Poltava, together with cruisers and destroyers, sortied to bombard Japanese coast defense positions on 9 July and briefly engaged Japanese ships that intercepted her. During the summer, the ship landed many of her 47 mm and 37 mm guns to reinforce the defenses of the port. =Battle of the Yellow Sea= On 10 August the Imperial Japanese Army, which had been slowly pushing south to Port Arthur, began an assault on the city's outer defenses. With their base now directly under attack, the First Pacific Squadron sortied in the morning, around 07:00, in an attempt to escape to Vladivostok. The Japanese fleet intercepted the Russian ships at 12:55 in what became the Battle of the Yellow Sea. Poltava was sixth in the column of Russian ships when the Japanese engaged them, and from her position started to bombard at around 14:45. The battleship , the Japanese flagship, then fired several shots that hit Poltava, causing the Russian squadron to drop back to support her. The Russians scored several hits on Mikasa, including two by Poltava. She also scored one hit on the armored cruiser . Owing to the damage Mikasa had sustained, the Japanese fleet broke off the attack at around 15:20 and turned to starboard, opening the range. By 17:35 the Japanese were again closing on the Russian rear. Mikasa and three other battleships opened fire on Poltava and three armored cruisers, but problems with their turrets forced the Japanese battleships to break off the engagement. They returned at 18:30, with and Asahi firing on Poltava. As the Russian fleet began to slip away, two 12-inch shells from Asahi penetrated the conning tower of the Russian flagship , killing Vitgeft and the helmsman, severely wounding the captain, and causing the ship to come to a dead stop after executing a sharp turn. Thinking that this was a maneuver planned by Vitgeft, the Russian line started to execute the same turn, causing all of the ships directly behind Tsesarevich, including Poltava, to maneuver wildly to avoid hitting the stationary flagship. Rear Admiral Prince Pavel Ukhtomsky, second in command of the squadron, signaled the other Russian ships to steam back to Port Arthur. The signal flags were only gradually recognized by Pobeda, Sevastopol, Pallada and Poltava and the other vessels took some time to re-form for the return voyage. Poltava was hit by 12 to 14 large-caliber shells during the battle that knocked out five of her 6-inch guns, as well as killing 12 crewmen and wounding 43. Poltava, along with Tsesarevich and , sustained hits at the waterline that crippled their maneuverability, preventing the Russian squadron from fleeing to Vladivostok. =Siege of Port Arthur= A Japanese postcard showing Poltava partially submerged at Port Arthur Returning to Port Arthur on 11 August, the Russian squadron found the city still under siege by the Japanese Third Army led by Baron Nogi Maresuke. Poltava was hit on 18 August by four shells, fired by a battery, that wounded six men. The new squadron commander, Rear Admiral Robert N. Viren, believed in reinforcing the landward defenses of the port and continued to strip guns, and sailors to man them, from his ships. By September Poltava had lost a total of three 6-inch, four 47 mm and twenty-six 37 mm guns. That same month, she began bombarding Japanese positions; through November she fired one hundred ten 12-inch shells and an unknown number of 6-inch shells. In October the advancing Third Army began to bombard the harbor with siege howitzers, firing at random. They hit Poltava twice on 7 October, though the shells only started fires. On 5 December the Japanese captured 203 Meter Hill, a crucial position that overlooked the harbor and allowed them to direct their artillery at the Russian ships. Poltava was hit that same day by five shells, three of which penetrated the deck. One hit a torpedo room, and another burst in the aft 47 mm magazine. That started a fire that could not be put out because the flooding system had been previously damaged and eventually ignited propellant charges in the adjacent 12-inch magazine. About a half-hour after the hit, the magazine exploded and blew a hole in the ship's bottom that caused her to sink 45 minutes later in the shallow water. = Japanese career = Tango at anchor around 1909 Following the capitulation of Port Arthur in January 1905, Japanese engineers refloated Poltava on 22 July, and commissioned her as Tango a month later, taking her name from the ancient Japanese province of Tango, now a part of Kyoto Prefecture. Classified as a 1st class battleship, she departed for Maizuru Naval Arsenal two days later and arrived on 29 August. Except for participating in the review of captured ships on 23 October 1905, she remained there under repair until November 1907. Tango then sailed to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal to complete fitting out. The IJN made several changes to the ship as she was repaired. Her fighting top was removed and her boilers were replaced by 16 Miyabara water-tube boilers. She retained her main guns, but their breeches were replaced by Japanese-built ones. Her secondary armament of eight 152 mm guns in twin turrets were retained, while her four casemated 152 mm guns were replaced by six Japanese-built 15 cm/45 41st Year Type guns; her light armament was revised to ten QF 12-pounder 12 cwt\\"Cwt\\" is the abbreviation for hundredweight, 12 cwt referring to the weight of the gun. and four 37 mm guns. Four 18-inch above-water torpedo tubes replaced her original torpedo armament. Her crew now numbered 668 officers and crewmen. Tango joined the fleet in 1911 and was re-classified as a 1st class coast defense ship in 1912. In 1913 she participated in the annual fleet maneuvers as part of the \\"enemy\\" force. She was assigned to the 2nd Squadron, commanded by Vice Admiral Kato Sadakichi, shortly after World War I began. The squadron was tasked to blockade the German-owned port of Tsingtao, China, and to cooperate with the Imperial Japanese Army in capturing the city. Tango and the other ships of the squadron bombarded German fortifications throughout the siege until the Germans surrendered on 7 November. = Return to Russia = Chesma at anchor in the White Sea, 1921 In 1916 the Russian government decided to reinforce its naval strength outside the Baltic and Black Seas. As Japan and Russia were allies during the war, the Japanese government sold Tango and some other ex-Russian warships back to Russia in March. The battleship arrived at Vladivostok on 2 April and was turned over to the Russians on either 3 or 4 April. Her former name had been given to the new dreadnought battleship Poltava, so Tango was renamed Chesma, after the 1770 Battle of Chesma. She departed Vladivostok on 2 July and arrived at Port Said, Egypt, on 19 September. Chesma joined the Allied fleet off Salamis demanding the disarmament of the Greek fleet later that month and departed after the Greeks agreed to meet the Allied demands. Her machinery was overhauled at Birkenhead by Cammell Laird, beginning on 5 December, and her main deck six-inch and 12-pounder guns were removed. In exchange she received four anti-aircraft guns mounted on her superstructure. She arrived at Aleksandrovsk, a port in the Murmansk Oblast, on 16 January 1917 and the political situation became very confused with the February Revolution shortly after her arrival. She was assigned to the White Sea Fleet on 3 February. Her crew declared for the Bolsheviks in October, but made no effort to interfere with the Allied landing at Murmansk in March 1918. Although the ship was deemed \\"aground and unseaworthy\\" by the British shortly afterwards, they seized the ship and used her as a floating prison in April 1919 to house 40 Bolshevik prisoners of war. After the British withdrew, the abandoned ship was captured by the Red Army in March 1920 and incorporated into the Bolshevik White Sea Military Flotilla on 24 April. No longer of any military value, she was turned over to the port of Archangelsk on 16 June 1921 and stricken from the list of naval vessels on 3 July 1924, after which she was scrapped.

It is south of the western Antelope Valley. Elizabeth Lake is one of a series of sag ponds created by the motion of the Earth's tectonic plates along the San Andreas Fault in the area, with others including Hughes Lake and the Munz Lakes.

The community of Elizabeth Lake is on the shore of the lake. It is administratively within the unincorporated community of Lake Hughes, and shares the same zip code. History  =Nomenclature= In 1780, the Spanish explorer-priest Junipero Serra named the lake La Laguna de Diablo (English: Devil's Lake), because some who lived nearby believed that within it dwelt a pet of the devil, which later came to be known as the Elizabeth Lake Monster. The creature is said to resemble a dragon, with leathery wings and scaly skin. Sometime after 1834, the lake was called La Laguna de Liebre (English: Rabbit Lake) for a short time. Then in the 1840s it became known as La Laguna de Chico Lopez, for Francisco \\"Chico\\" Lopez, who grazed cattle on its banks. Mildred Brooke Hoover, E. G. Rensch and H. E.

It became a well established inland route, and an alternative to the coastal El Camino Real trail used since the 1770s. Locally, it ascended the Sierra Pelona Mountains via San Francisquito Canyon, crossed through San Francisquito Pass, ran north to the lake, and then skirted it and continued northwest to Aguaje Lodoso (Mud Spring) in the Antelope Valley and westward to Cow Springs and the Cuddy Valley, and then down Cuddy Canyon to the San Joaquin Valley. Another inland route diverged from the El Camino Viejo at Elizabeth Lake, going north to cross the western Antelope Valley and then up Cottonwood Creek canyon, to cross over the Tehachapi Mountains via Old Tejon Pass, and down Tejon Creek canyon to the San Joaquin Valley. After 1843, much of that section was within the Mexican Alta California land grant of Rancho Tejon.Map of Passes in the Sierra Nevada from Walker's Pass to the Coast Range: from Explorations and Surveys made under the direction of the Hon.

Horace Bell, Reminiscences of a ranger: or, early times in Southern California, Yarnell, Caystile & Mathes, printers, Los Angeles, 1881, p. 250 In 1854, the route to the San Joaquin Valley shifted away from the Old Tejon Pass route to the Stockton - Los Angeles Road, using the Fort Tejon Pass, and the Grapevine Canyon. The later Butterfield Overland Mail shortened the route to Cow Springs avoiding Mud Springs, skirting Elizabeth Lake to its north westward via the San Andreas Rift to Oakgrove Canyon then north via Pine Canyon to Antelope Valley and westward again to Cow Springs. The first building at the lake was La Casa de Miguel Ortiz, an adobe built by Miguel Ortiz, a muleteer, on land given him by his employer, Edward Fitzgerald Beale. Southwest of the Ortiz Adobe was the Andrada Stage Station adobe, sited where the old Fort Tejon Road entered San Francisquito Canyon.

The lake has been dry ever since 2013, unrelated to the fire but because of a drought. Education In 1869, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors designated the Elizabeth Lake School District to serve the area, which had the only established school between Los Angeles and Bakersfield. Land for the school was donated by Samuel and Almeda Frakes from their ranch lands. Children from the Lake Hughes, Elizabeth Lake, and Green Valley areas are still served by this school district. The 1869 wooden schoolhouse lasted until it was replaced by an adobe structure in the early 1930s, located on the east side of Elizabeth Lake Road, ¬º mile north of Andrada Corner at the intersection of San Francisquito and Elizabeth Lake Roads.

The school suffered a small amount of damage (mainly to large trees within the school grounds that had to be cleared prior to student occupation) and was closed from 11 to 12 June 2007. The school was re-opened on 13 June 2007, to seniors only and was opened to all years on 18 June 2007. On 29 September 2008, the Federal Cabinet (including Prime Minister Kevin Rudd) attended Lambton High School as part of the Australian Government Community Cabinet Program. Examination results At the 2009 HSC, Lambton High School ranked 143rd in New South Wales, up from 150th in 2008. In 2008, it increased its student \\"All rounders\\" from 33 to 47. However, in 2014, Lambton High's HSC ranking fell to 388th in the state from 198th in 2013, which was the largest decline of any school in the Newcastle, Lake Macquarie, Upper Hunter or Central Coast Region.http://cdn.fairfaxregional.com.au/EDDIENEWS/20-HS%20RATING.pdf Student leadership Lambton High School promotes student leadership through groups such as the \\"Prefect Body\\" and the \\"Student Representative Council\\". The Prefect Body is made of sixteen Year 12 students who are elected by peers and staff for a period of twelve months. This body is led in turn by the school captains, the vice-captains and the senior prefects. Carolyn Hayden is responsible for student leadership. The Student Representative Council (SRC), is made up of two students from each year group (Years 7-11) and the senior prefects. This group is elected in early February each year and in turn elects its own leaders. The school principal is responsible for the SRC. Other leadership opportunities are available through various sporting teams and environmental committees. Co-curricular activities = Green Day = In 1995 the school began celebrating \\"Green Day\\", to raise awareness about environmental problems and promote environmental sustainability. In 2007, the Green Day slogan was \\"Keep on Rockin' For a Green World\\" and the focus was on climate change and global warming. = Sport = The school also holds prestigious positioning in events such as basketball, netball and waterpolo.

A shrub up to tall, it has dense foliage and leaves with very prickly serrated margins. Its unusual pinkish, pendent (hanging) flower spikes, known as inflorescences, are generally hidden in the foliage and appear during the early summer. Although it was collected by the naturalist James Drummond in the 1840s, Banksia aculeata was not formally described until 1981, by Alex George in his monograph of the genus. A rare plant, Banksia aculeata is found in gravelly soils in elevated areas. Native to a habitat burnt by periodic bushfires, it is killed by fire and regenerates from seed afterwards. In contrast to other Western Australian banksias, it appears to have some resistance to the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi.  Description  A bushy shrub, Banksia aculeata grows up to tall, with fissured grey bark on its trunk and branches. Unlike many other banksia species, it does not have a woody base, or lignotuber. The leaves range from long and wide, with sharply pointed rigid lobes on the margins. Appearing in February and March, the cylindrical flower spikes‚Äîknown as inflorescences‚Äîrange from long, growing at the ends of short leafy 2‚Äì3-year-old side branches. Hanging downward rather than growing upright like those of most other banksias, they are composed of a central woody spike or axis, from which many compact individual flowers arise perpendicularly. These floral units are made up of a smooth tubular perianth that envelops the flower's sexual organs. The perianth is long and pink at the base grading into cream. In late bud, the end of the perianth has a characteristic four-angled (squarish) appearance. It then splits at anthesis to reveal the smooth straight pistil, which is slightly shorter than its enveloping structure at long. The fruiting cone, known as an infructescence, is a swollen woody spike in which up to 20 massive follicles are embedded; the withered flower parts persist on the spike, giving it a hairy appearance. Oval in shape, the follicles are wrinkled in texture and covered with fine hair. They are long, high, and wide. The obovate (egg- shaped) seed is long and fairly flattened. It is composed of the wedge-shaped seed body (containing the embryonic plant), measuring long by wide, and a papery wing. One side, termed the outer surface, is grey and wrinkled and the other is black and sparkles slightly. The seeds are separated by a sturdy dark brown seed separator that is roughly the same shape as the seeds with a depression where the seed body sits adjacent to it in the follicle. Known as cotyledons, the first pair of leaves produced by seedlings are cuneate (wedge- shaped) and measure long by wide. They are dull dark green, sometimes with a reddish tinge, and the margin of the wedge is convex. The auricle at the base of the cotyledon leaf is pointed and measures long. The hypocotyl is thick, smooth and dark red. The obovate to oblong seedling leaves are long by wide with serrated margins, v-shaped sinuses and sharp teeth. The related Banksia caleyi is similar in appearance but can be distinguished by its recurved (downward curving) leaf margins, and smaller follicles and perianths. Its flowers appear from October to December.  Taxonomy  Banksia aculeata was first collected by James Drummond on one of his three trips to the Stirling Range between 1843 and 1848, though he did not regard it as distinct from B. caleyi‚Äîthis was only recognised over a century later by Alex George. George described B. aculeata in his 1981 monograph \\"The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)\\". For the type of the species, George selected a specimen he collected on Chester Pass Road in the Stirling Range east of Cranbrook on 20 March 1972. He gave it the specific epithet aculeata (Latin for \\"sharp\\"), in reference to the sharply pointed leaf lobes. George placed B. aculeata in B. subg. Banksia because its inflorescence is a typical Banksia flower spike; in B. sect. Banksia because of its straight styles; and B. ser. Tetragonae because of its pendulous inflorescences. He considered its closest relative to be B. caleyi, from which it differs in having narrower leaves with fewer, larger lobes; longer perianths, which grade from red to cream rather than from cream to red; shorter pistils; and also differences in the follicles, seeds and flowering time. In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published the results of a cladistic analysis of morphological characters of Banksia. They retained George's subgenera and many of his series, but discarded his sections. George's B. ser. Tetragonae was found to be monophyletic, and therefore retained; and their analysis of the relationships within the series supported the placement of B. aculeata alongside B. caleyi. Flower spikes in early bud stage B. aculeatas placement in Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement may be summarised as follows: :Banksia ::B. subg. Isostylis (3 species) ::B. elegans (incertae sedis) ::B. subg. Banksia :::B. ser. Tetragonae ::::B. elderiana ::::B. lemanniana ::::B. caleyi ::::B. aculeata The arrangement of Thiele and Ladiges was not accepted by George and was discarded in his 1999 revision. Under George's 1999 arrangement, B. aculeatas placement was as follows: :Banksia ::B. subg. Banksia :::B. sect. Banksia ::::B. ser. Salicinae (11 species, 7 subspecies) ::::B. ser. Grandes (2 species) ::::B. ser. Banksia (8 species) ::::B. ser. Crocinae (4 species) ::::B. ser. Prostratae (6 species, 3 varieties) ::::B. ser. Cyrtostylis (13 species) ::::B. ser. Tetragonae :::::B. lemanniana :::::B. caleyi :::::B. aculeata Since 1998, Austin Mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is rather different from previous taxonomic arrangements, but support the placement of B. aculeata alongside B. caleyi in a clade corresponding closely with B. ser. Tetragonae. A 2013 molecular study by Marcel Cardillo and colleagues using chloroplast DNA and combining it with earlier results found that B. aculeata was sister to B. lemanniana and that B. caleyi was the next closest relative. Early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring Dryandra to Banksia, and publishing B. subg. Spathulatae for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons; in this way they also redefined the autonym B. subg. Banksia. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. aculeata is placed in B. subg. Banksia.  Distribution and habitat  Distribution within Western Australia B. aculeata is native to the foothills of the Stirling Range in the southwest of Western Australia, occurring at elevations between , in shrubland in gravelly, clayish soils. The annual rainfall is around . It is a fairly rare plant, with most populations consisting of fewer than 100 plants. With fairly small populations and a narrow distribution, B. aculeata is considered rare, but is not currently classed as endangered because at least some populations are thought not to be under immediate threat. The Department of Environment and Conservation of the Western Australian State Government classes it as \\"Priority Two ‚Äì Poorly Known\\" flora.  Ecology  Like many plants in Australia's southwest, Banksia aculeata is adapted to an environment in which bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. B. aculeata is killed by fire because it possesses neither thick protective bark nor a lignotuber to reshoot from. It is serotinous‚Äîit accumulates a canopy seed bank that is released only in response to fire‚Äîso populations typically recover rapidly after a fire, but this strategy makes it dependent on a suitable fire regime. Plants take three to four years to reach flowering after a bushfire. Pollinators have not been observed, and the flowering period is brief when compared with other banksias. However, the flowers appear when little else is in bloom, rendering it a valuable food source for animals. B. aculeata has been reported as susceptible to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, but in a 2008 study this pathogen was found to have no direct impact on the species. As a result of this finding, together with the low percentage of populations infested or facing imminent infestation, the species was classed as having a very low extinction risk.  Cultivation  Banksia aculeata grows slowly, generally taking five to six years to flower from seed, though there is a report of it flowering in three years at Strathmerton in Victoria. Regarding its potential as an ornamental plant, Alex George observes that the flowers are brightly coloured but have a short life and are obscured by the foliage, which is quite prickly. He nonetheless considers both the new foliage and the infructescence attractive. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 5.5 to 6.5. It prefers full sun, although it will grow in partly shaded situations, producing fewer flowers. It will tolerate light pruning.

Mungalalu Truscott is about west-southwest of Darwin and northeast of Broome. Located on the Anjo Peninsula in the far North Kimberley district of Western Australia. Mungalalu Truscott occupies on Aboriginal land. The airbase falls under the traditional ownership of the Wunambal Gaambera people, who use the traditional name for the area: Mungalalu. The base is managed by Mungalalu Truscott Airbase Pty Ltd (MT Airbase) and has been registered with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority as a commercial air base since April 2005. MT Airbase manages the Mungalalu Truscott Base under an agreement with the Wunambal Gaambera Aboriginal Corporation (WGAC). Agreement has been reached with WGAC to sub lease the airfield and base area with licences for access to certain roads and areas of coastline until 2042. A CHC Helicopters Super Puma helicopter takes off from Truscott Air Base en route to the off shore oil and gas fields in 2007 Warning sign at the landing ramp in West Bay which supports the resupply of Truscott Air Base  Current operations  Today the airbase has multiple roles, but primarily that of a staging base for workers on the offshore oil and gas fields in the Timor Sea. In addition it serves as an Aeromedical Retrieval and Search & Rescue (S.A.R.) base from which helicopter operations can be conducted with Critical Care Flight Paramedics on board. Operations include oil & gas companies, RFDS calls and AusSAR activations. Workers are flown into the base by fixed wing aircraft and then transferred to helicopters at Mungalalu Truscott for the final flight leg to offshore facilities in and around the Timor Sea. Currently, three Sikorsky S92 helicopters operated by Babcock Helicopters are based at Mungalalu Truscott. In the recent past there have been up to seven helicopters of varying types operated out of the base by Babcock, Bristow Helicopters and CHC. Other regular users of the base include the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service who use the airbase as a staging post for their aerial surveillance patrols in the area. In April 2020 PHI International began operations from Mungalalu Truscott Airbase using S92 aircraft to support the Ichthys gas field operated by Inpex. One of the Paspaley Pearl company's Grumman Mallards taxis into Truscott Airbase to pick up rotating crew transferring to remote pearl farm operations via the flying boats in 2007 Mungalalu Truscott is the largest all-weather airbase in the Far North Kimberley Region. The sealed runway with PAPI lights for night operations is the premier option for companies with business interests in the region. Mungalalu Truscott complies with CASA MoS 139 regulation and allows unrestricted operations for aircraft up to 29 seat capacity. The runway is with turning nodes, ramps and taxiways. There are two hangars currently (2014) certified by CASA as maintenance hangars, two additional covered storage hangars and a well equipped medical facility. There is camp accommodation with individual rooms for 71 pax and facilities include a shared mess, swimming pool and gymnasium. In past years, numerous aircraft types have utilised the aerodrome; they have included Fairchild Metro 23, Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia and Bombardier Dash 8.  History  = World War II = Keith \\"Bluey\\" Truscott in 1941 The airfield was originally constructed in 1944 by the RAAF Airfield Construction Unit, under Commanding Officer S/Ldr Trevor Nossiter, as a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) base and was actively used during World War II. RAAF Truscott was named after the Australian air ace, Keith \\"Bluey\\" Truscott, who had been killed in a training accident in 1943. The World War II base was built to succeed a temporary base south at Drysdale River Mission (Kalumburu), and was a staging base for Allied bombers and flying boats, from bases further south, making attacks on Japanese targets in the Dutch East Indies. The site was chosen because it is the point on the Australian mainland closest to Java, where Japanese forces were concentrated. Aircraft from nearby RAAF fighter squadrons (and occasionally RAF units) were rotated through the base to provide air defence for the base. Construction and the subsequent operations from the base were conducted under total secrecy and the existence of the base was never formally acknowledged until after the war. Bomb tail fin assemblies, remnant from World War II at Truscott in 2007 The host unit at the base was RAAF 58 Operating Base Unit (58OBU). Australian Army anti-aircraft and searchlight batteries were also based at Truscott scattered around the peninsula. A civilian work unit from the Allied Works Council was based at Truscott for the maintenance of roads around the base and a RAAF Marine Section was stationed in West Bay to support the Catalina Flying Boat operations, operate search and rescue water craft and support the maritime resupply of the air base. Truscott war relics in 2007 RAAF, Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force (ML-KNIL) and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) heavy and medium bombers would stage through Truscott, often rearming and refuelling several times on bombing missions into Japanese held areas before returning to their home bases around Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Truscott war relics in 2007 B-24 Liberator heavy bombers and B-25 Mitchell medium bombers were two of the most common airframes to stage through Truscott. Catalina flying boats operated from West Bay and Spitfire aircraft were the most common fighter rotated through the base for local air defence. Truscott war relics in 2007 On 18 January 1944, two RAAF personnel, Sergeants Castle and Martin, part of a unit making preparations for construction of the airfield heard a vessel which they suspected was a Japanese submarine or boat. In order to prevent Japanese forces learning of Truscott's location, they did not investigate. They reported their story to North-Western Area Headquarters who thought that it may have been a Japanese submarine running on the surface to charge its batteries. It was later confirmed that they had heard a Japanese reconnaissance vessel named Hiyoshi Maru, a converted 25 ton fishing boat. Research done after the war has confirmed that Lieutenant Susuhiko Mizuno lead a special Japanese Army reconnaissance party from Kupang, in Timor on board the Hiyoshi Maru. The party landed on Browse Island and stayed for about 3 hours. On the next morning they entered an inlet on the Western Australian coast. Three landing parties led by Lieutenant Susuhiko Mizuno, Sergeant Morita and Sergeant Furuhashi, went ashore and explored different areas. They even took some 8 mm movie footage of what they saw. As it turned out they had landed only from where the RAAF were several weeks later to start building the secret airfield. On 20 July 1944 a Japanese Mitsubishi Ki-46-II \\"Dinah\\" Aircraft, piloted by Lt. Kiyoshi Izuka with his observer Lt. Hisao Itoh was shot down over the Anjo Peninsula by a flight of No. 54 Squadron RAF Spitfires killing both crew. As of September 2007 the remains of the Japanese aircraft was still on the peninsula near the current operating air base. At the end of the war the base was closed down, with it playing a small role as a transit camp for the repatriation of Dutch citizens from the former Netherlands East Indies in 1946. = Crashes during World War II = Remnants of Liberator A72-160 as seen at Truscott in 2007 Several significant air accidents occurred during the operation of the base in World War II. On 16 November 1944, two Spitfires from No. 549 Squadron RAF collided while changing formation in preparation for landing at the base. Warrant Officer Bushell, pilot of Spitfire A58-364, managed to parachute to safety; but W/O Posse, pilot of A58-300 died in the crash. Remnants of both aircraft still exist near the present airstrip. On 23 March 1945, Liberator A72-80, under the command of Squadron Leader N. H. Straus, crashed shortly after takeoff. Straus found that the plane was unable to climb above about , and turned around at Parry Harbour. He was unable to see the runway, and the aircraft crashed into the sea about one kilometre short of Truscott, killing all on board (11 crew, and one passenger) . On 20 May 1945, Liberator A72-160 (a B-24M-10-CO model), on a mission to Balikpapan and piloted by Flight Lieutenant F. L. Sismey, crashed soon after take off, near the north west end of the runway. The aircraft was destroyed by its depth charges exploding. All 11 crew members were killed. Remnants of Liberator A72-160 as seen at Truscott in 2007 One of the most well known aircraft wrecks at Truscott actually pre-dates the base by two years. On the western side of the air base, in Vansittart Bay, there lies the wreckage of a USAAF Air Transport Command C-53 Skytrooper transport (a variant of the Douglas DC-3; serial number 41-20066). This aircraft made an emergency landing on 26 February 1942, after the pilot got lost while flying from Perth to Broome, and put it down on a salt pan on Anjo Peninsula. The crew and passengers were rescued by a commercial flying boat several days later. = Heritage value = Mungalalu Truscott Base has been classified and entered into the Council of the National Trust of Western Australia list of Heritage Places due to its significance during World War II and the remaining artefacts. The Trust may nominate Mungalalu Truscott Base for inclusion by the Australian Heritage Council in the Register of the National Estate in the future. The Trust has communicated that the classification has \\"no legal significance and does not infringe any rights of ownership\\" leaving administration to the joint understanding of the operator (MT Airbase) and the WGAC.

It has smooth, grey bark, deeply serrated, hairy leaves and spikes of bright orange flowers. Description Banksia ashbyi is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of and sometimes forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, grey bark and young stems that are hairy at first but become glabrous as they age. The leaves are broadly linear, long and wide and deeply serrated, the serrations triangular with sharply pointed tips. The flower spikes are bright orange, long and in diameter, each perianth long. Flowering occurs from February to May or July to December and the fruits are numerous smooth, elliptical to round follicles long, high and wide with a covering of short, soft hairs. Taxonomy and naming Banksia ashbyi was first formally described in 1934 by Edmund Gilbert Baker in the Journal of Botany, British and Foreign. The specific epithet honours Edwin Ashby, one of the collectors of the type specimens. In 2008, Alex George described two subspecies in the journal Nuytsia and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Banksia ashbyi subsp. ashbyi grows as a tree up to in height, lacks a lignotuber and is fire-sensitive; * Banksia ashbyi subsp. boreoscaia grows as a sprawling shrub no more than high and is lignotuberous. Distribution and habitat Ashby's banksia grows in heath and spinifex country along the coast of Western Australia between Geraldton and Exmouth. Subspecies ashbyi occurs between Shark Bay and Coorow as well as in the Kennedy Range. Subspecies boreoscaia is found further north, between North West Cape and Quobba. Conservation status This banksia is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Ecology An assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that its range is unlikely to contract and may actually grow, depending on how effectively it migrates into newly habitable areas.

It has serrated leaves and a distinctively large and hairy looking inflorescence with cream, yellow or brown flowers, and hairy fruit. Description Banksia baueri grows as a many-branched spreading shrub reaching high, and wide but does not form a lignotuber. Its bark is thin and grey with long fissures, while new growth is covered in fine pale brown fur. New growth occurs in summer. The leaves are usually narrow egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long and wide with serrated edges, tapering to a petiole long. The inflorescence develops over 5‚Äì6 months, and can reach in diameter, high and is borne on a short side branch. The flowers are cream, yellow or brown and hairy, the perianth long and the pistil long with a glabrous style. The fruit is a hairy, elliptical follicle long. Taxonomy Robert Brown described Banksia baueri in 1830, after it had been collected by William Baxter at King Georges Sound in 1829. The description was published in Brown's supplement to his Prodromus. It was named for the brothers Austrian botanical artists Franz and Ferdinand Bauer, Ferdinand having travelled with Brown on his 1801‚Äì05 voyage. Under Brown's taxonomic arrangement, B. baueri was placed in subgenus Banksia verae, the \\"True Banksias\\", because the inflorescence is a typical Banksia flower spike. Banksia verae was renamed Eubanksia by Stephan Endlicher in 1847, and demoted to sectional rank by Carl Meissner in his 1856 classification. Meissner further divided Eubanksia into four series, with B. baueri placed in series Quercinae on the basis of its toothed leaves. When George Bentham published his 1870 arrangement in Flora Australiensis, he discarded Meissner's series, replacing them with four sections. B. baueri was placed in Cyrtostylis, a heterogeneous section containing 13 species that did not readily fit elsewhere. This arrangement would stand for over a century. In 1891, German botanist Otto Kuntze challenged the generic name Banksia L.f., on the grounds that the name Banksia had previously been published in 1775 as Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst, referring to the genus now known as Pimelea. Kuntze proposed Sirmuellera as an alternative, republishing B. baueri as Sirmuellera baueri. The challenge failed, and Banksia L.f. was formally conserved. It is placed alone in series Banksia series Bauerinae. In his 1981 monograph on the genus, Alex George classified it in the reinstated but much-reduced series Quercinae, alongside Banksia quercifolia and B. oreophila. However he noted its follicles, which are beaked after they open, and cotyledon shape, did not fit with the other taxa and pondered an affinity with B. menziesii and B. sceptrum Common names include woolly banksia, possum banksia, woolly-spiked banksia, pussy cat banksia or teddy bear banksia, all of which relate to the large furry flower spikes. Distribution and habitat Banksia baueri is found in southern Western Australia in three disjunct areas - from Bremer Bay in the east to Jerdacuttup, on the south Stirling Plains, and to the northwest inland between Kweda and Tarin Rock. Plants grow in shrubland or mallee, on flat or genty sloping ground, on white or grey sand or on shallow sand over laterite or quartzite. Ecology A 1985‚Äì86 field study in the Fitzgerald River National Park found it to be a main wintertime food source for the nectar-feeding honey possum (Tarsipes rostratus). Use in horticulture Its unusual flower spikes are an attractive horticultural feature. It requires well-drained soil in full sun or part shade. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 20 to 49 days to germinate.

China's Mengniu Dairy expressed an interest to purchase Lion Dairy & Drinks for $600 million, in 2019. Whilst the ACCC gave clearance in Feb 20, 2020 the sale it yet to receive FIRB approval. On August 25, 2020, it was announced Kirin and Mengniu decided to cancel the sale because rising geopolitical tensions between Australia and China meant it was unlikely approval from Australian regulators would materialize.https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/25/business/lion-dairy- australia-china-intl-hnk/index.html History On , the Dairy Farmers Co- operative Milk Co. Limited was created by 65 stakeholders, most being dairy farmers in the Illawarra region of New South Wales. The aim of the co- operative was to market their milk and butter products effectively to city customers. Dairy Farmers was 100% Australian owned by Australian dairy farmers for 107 years, and ultimately had 11 processing facilities. In 2005, Dairy Farmers had the third-highest dairy sales in Australia, with Norco Co- operative second and National Foods, under its brand \\"Pura\\", first. In 2008, Dairy Farmers was acquired by Kirin Holdings (Australia) Pty Ltd, part of the Kirin Group of Japan, and became a 'brand' of National Foods, which Kirin has bought the previous year, ending 108 years as a co-operative company. After Kirin Holdings acquired the alcoholic beverage company, Lion Nathan, in 2009, National Foods & Lion Nathan were merged to become \\"Lion Nathan National Foods\\". Lion Nathan National Foods became Lion and Lion Dairy & Drinks in 2011. Dairy Farmers' head office was located in Homebush Bay, Sydney until 2008. Lion Dairy & Drinks has its head office is in Melbourne, but LD&D;'s parent, Lion, has its corporate head office in Sydney. In November 2019, China's Mengniu Dairy purchased Dairy Farmers‚Äô parent company Lion Dairy & Drinks from Kirin, for approximately AUD $600 million (US$407 million). The deal was cancelled in August 2020 due to approval from Australian regulators being unlikely to materialize because of rising geopolitical tensions between China and Australia.https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/25/business/lion-dairy- australia-china-intl-hnk/index.html Brands Dairy Farmers brand is mainly used for fresh milk (in NSW and Queensland), UHT \\"long-life\\" milk (Australia wide), \\"Thick & Creamy\\" yoghurt, and desserts, creams, custard and buttermilk. Dairy Farmers produced the \\"Ski\\" yoghurt range (its main competitor being Yoplait) under licence from brand owner Nestl√©, but after the company was acquired by National Foods (Kirin Holdings) in 2008, Fonterra purchased the \\"Ski\\" brand (still under licence from Nestl√©), with the brand name changing to \\"Nestl√© Ski\\" in 2012. In 2016 Fonterra divested its yoghurt range, which includes \\"Nestl√© Ski\\" and \\"Nestl√© Soleil\\", selling it to Parmalat. As a company (prior to 2009), Dairy Farmers marketed a number of brands: a selection of milk, yogurt, cheese, cream, custard and flavoured milk varieties, sold under the main brand. The company had 11 processing plants in Australia, including at Wetherill Park in Sydney. Company milestones *1900 ‚Äì Company established (The Dairy Farmers Co-operative Milk Co.

It has hairy, linear leaves, usually with scattered small teeth along the edges, and spikes of orange flowers. Description Banksia benthamiana is a shrub that typically grows to a height of but does not form a lignotuber. Its bark is roughly flaking and grey and the branchlets are densely covered with rust-coloured hairs. The leaves are linear in shape, mostly long and wide on a petiole long. The sides of the leaves usually have small teeth long and apart along one half or more. Both surfaces of the leaves are hairy when young. The flowering spike is borne on a short side branch and is long and about wide when the flowers open. Each flower has a hairy perianth long and a glabrous, curved pistil long. Flowering occurs from late November to January and up to 130 narrow elliptical, smooth, furry follicles long, high and wide, develop in each spike. Taxonomy Banksia benthamiana was first formally described in 1964 by Charles Gardner in the Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia. The original type specimens were collected in January 1940 near Dalwallinu. The specific epithet honours George Bentham (1800‚Äì1884), author of Flora Australiensis. This banksia has been traditionally considered to be closely related to B. ashbyi, a larger shrub with larger, more deeply lobed leaves, bright orange flowers and wider, more rounded follicles. It is probably related also to B. audax, a much smaller species with pubescent-hirsute perianth. Using morphological cladistics, Kevin Thiele placed it in a group with B. audax and B. laevigata, based on very small distinctive seedling leaves, and linear pollen presenters. This grouping was supported in Mast and Givnish‚Äôs 2002 molecular study. The position of Banksia ashbyi was unclear in this latter study but it did not appear to be closely related. Distribution and habitat This banksia is found in scattered populations between Mullewa and Kulja in Western Australia. It grows on plains in shrubland, sometimes as an emergent plant, on brownish yellow sandy loam or clay-loam, sometimes over laterite. Many of the populations are small and on road verges. The annual rainfall in these areas is around . Conservation status Banksia benthamiana is currently classified as \\"Priority Four\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that is rare or near threatened. Ecology Volunteers for the 1985 Banksia Atlas reported that moths and birds have been seen pollinating it. Use in horticulture Banksia benthamiana is almost unknown in cultivation and unsuitable for small gardens, but can be grown in a container and is fast growing. A slightly acid deep sand or gravel soil is desirable. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 42 days to germinate.

It occurs on sandplain country north of Gingin, Western Australia. Growing to 4 m (13 ft) in height, it has long serrated leaves and large, bright flower spikes, initially white before opening to a bright orange, that appear mainly in late summer (February and March). Edmund Gilbert Baker described B. burdettii in 1934, naming it after its collector, W. Burdett. Description Banksia burdettii grows as an evergreen shrub to a height of . The new growth is hairy, though longer stems are smooth. The sturdy, serrated grey green leaves are long and wide with a narrow oblong or wedge-shape and a truncate tip. The toothed margins are slightly downcurved. Burdett's banksia has cm high flower spikes, known as inflorescences, that prominently displayed on the ends of stems, appearing between the months of January and May, peaking over February and March. A 1988 field study in Watheroo National Park revealed that each flower spike has 972 ¬± 130 florets. The individual flowers are hairy and white on the outside and orange within, the flower spikes turning from white to orange as anthesis proceeds up the spike. Old flower spikes fade to grey over time, and develop up to 20 follicles (seed pods) each. Each follicle contains two seeds, though around 36% of seeds are nonviable. Almost all follicles remain closed until opened by bushfire. Taxonomy Banksia burdettii was described in 1934 by Edmund Gilbert Baker, from a specimen grown from seed collected at Watheroo by one W. Burdett in 1930. Baker felt it had affinities to B. baueri, B. prionotes and B. menziesii, placing it in the series Cyrtostylis. In 1981, Alex George published a revised arrangement that placed B. prionotes in the subgenus Banksia because of its flower spike, section Banksia because its styles are straight rather than hooked, and the series Crocinae, a new series of four closely related species, all with bright orange perianths and pistils. George's arrangement remained current until 1996, when Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published an arrangement informed by a cladistic analysis of morphological characteristics. Their arrangement maintained B. burdettii in B. subg. Banksia, but discarded George's sections and his series Crocinae. Instead, B. burdettii was placed at the end of series Banksia, in subseries Cratistylis. Questioning the emphasis on cladistics in Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement, George published a slightly modified version of his 1981 arrangement in his 1999 treatment of Banksia for the Flora of Australia series of monographs. To date, this remains the most recent comprehensive arrangement. The placement of B. burdettii in George's 1999 arrangement may be summarised as follows: :Banksia ::B. subg. Banksia :::B. sect. Banksia ::::B. ser. Salicinae (11 species, 7 subspecies) ::::B. ser. Grandes (2 species) ::::B. ser. Banksia (8 species) ::::B. ser. Crocinae :::::B. burdettii :::::B. prionotes :::::B. hookeriana :::::B. victoriae Since 1998, American botanist Austin Mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae, which includes Banksia. With respect to B. prionotes, Mast's results are fairly consistent with those of both George and Thiele and Ladiges. Series Crocinae appears to be monophyletic, and B. hookeriana is confirmed as B. prionotes closest relative. Overall, however, the inferred phylogeny is very different from George's arrangement. Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of Banksiinae by publishing several new names, including subgenus Spathulatae for the species of Banksia that have spoon-shaped cotyledons; in this way they also redefined the autonym B. subgenus Banksia. They have not yet published a full arrangement, but if their nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. burdettii is placed in subgenus Banksia. Distribution and habitat Found between Eneabba and Mogumber in Western Australia, Banksia burdettii is locally common where it occurs. Ecology Banksia burdettii is very sensitive to bushfire, and plants are killed by even small fires, the old cones being highly combustible. More cones are burnt and opened in hot fires. This species is strongly serotinous: seed is released only following a fire. Thus plants accumulate a large number of viable seen in an aerial seed bank in fire intervals, which is released all at once after a fire, ensuring population regeneration. The resulting plants take around four or five years to flower, shorter than many other banksia species. Optimal fire intervals generally fall between ten and twenty years, though it will reproduce outside this range. Spring fires are thought to be more beneficial for reproduction due to more reliable rainfall and hence germination afterwards. Burnt follicles open with water, so may remain intact after dry spells to open. The flowers are fed at (and pollinated by) a range of honeyeater species, including the white-cheeked honeyeater (Phylidonyris nigra), brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta), spiny-cheeked honeyeater (Acanthagenys rufogularis), red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata) and western wattlebird (A. lunulata). Carnaby's black cockatoos (Calyptorhynchus latirostris) eat seed from follicles, dropping old flower cones around the plant. The honey possum (Tarsipes rostratus) also visits the flowers. Weevils (Curculionidae) eat seeds, especially in older cones. Use in horticulture Banksia burdettii is fairly easy to grow in areas with a Mediterranean climate, but does not do well in areas with high summer humidity. It requires a sunny position in well- drained soil. Once established the plant is resistant to both frost and drought, it prefers sun or light shade and well drained soils. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 20 to 42 days to germinate.

It generally grows as a dense shrub up to 2 m (7 ft) tall, has serrated leaves and red, pendent (hanging) inflorescences which are generally hidden in the foliage. First described by Scottish naturalist Robert Brown in 1830, Banksia caleyi was named in honour of the English botanist George Caley. No subspecies are recognised. It is one of three or four related species with hanging inflorescences, which is an unusual feature within the genus. Found south and east of the Stirling Ranges through to the vicinity of Jerramungup, Banksia caleyi grows in a habitat marked by periodic bushfires. Plants are killed by fire and regenerate by seed afterwards. The species was classified as \\"Not Threatened\\" under the Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia. In contrast to most other Western Australian banksias, it appears to have some resistance to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, and is comparatively easy to grow in cultivation. Description Cream and pink flowers Banksia caleyi grows as a many-branched bushy shrub to 2 m (7 ft) in height, with crumbly grey bark. Rarely, plants of up to have been found. The new growth is hairy, and generally occurs in summer. The branchlets become smooth after around two years. The stiff leaves are narrowly wedge-shaped (cuneate) and measure in length by wide. The leaf margins are serrated, with many teeth measuring each. Flowering takes place between September and January. The inflorescences hang down from the ends of three- to five-year-old branchlets deep within the shrub and measure in length and roughly in diameter. The flowers are cream at the base and deep pink to red in the upper half, and are brightest before anthesis and then gradually fade with age. The inflorescences eventually turn grey, the old flowers remaining as up to 25 large woody follicles develop. Oval in shape and covered with fine hair, the follicles can reach long, high, and wide. The obovate seed is long and fairly flattened, and is composed of the wedge-shaped seed body proper, measuring long and 1.6‚Äì1.7 cm ( in) wide, and a papery wing. One side, termed the outer surface, is dark brown and wrinkled, while the other is black and smooth. Both surfaces sparkle slightly. The seeds are separated by a sturdy dark brown seed separator that is roughly the same shape as the seeds with a depression where the seed body sits adjacent to it in the follicle. Seedlings have cuneate cotyledons which measure long and 1.3‚Äì1.4 cm ( in) wide. These are dull green with three veins, and the margin of the wedge may be red and crenulated (lined with small teeth). The hypocotyl is red and measures high. Seedlings have hairy stems and leaves that are oppositely arranged (arising from the stem in pairs) that are obovate with triangular-lobed serrate margins. Taxonomy Robert Brown formally described Banksia caleyi in his 1830 work Supplementum primum Prodromi florae Novae Hollandiae, naming it in honour of the English botanist George Caley. The type specimen was collected by William Baxter, inland from King George Sound on Western Australia's south coast, in 1829. Carl Meissner placed B. caleyi in series Quercinae in his 1856 arrangement of the genus on account of its strongly dentate, cuneate to obovate leaves. As they were defined on leaf characters alone, all of Meissner's series were highly heterogeneous. Meissner also described B. caleyi variety sinuosa from material collected by James Drummond, which was reviewed by Alex George and found to be no different from the other collections of B. caleyi. Drummond also collected material identified as B. caleyi that was named as a distinct species‚ÄîBanksia aculeata‚Äîin 1981. No subspecies of B. caleyi itself are recognised. George Bentham published a thorough revision of Banksia in his landmark publication Flora Australiensis in 1870. In Bentham's arrangement, the number of recognised Banksia species was reduced from 60 to 46. Bentham defined four sections based on leaf, style and pollen-presenter characters. Banksia caleyi was placed in section Orthostylis. In his 1891 work Revisio Generum Plantarum, German botanist Otto Kuntze challenged the generic name Banksia L.f., on the grounds that the name Banksia had previously been published in 1775 as Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst, referring to the genus now known as Pimelea. Kuntze proposed Sirmuellera as an alternative, republishing B. caleyi as Sirmuellera caleyi. The challenge failed, and Banksia L.f. was formally conserved in 1940. In his 1981 monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae), Alex George placed B. caleyi in B. subg. Banksia because its inflorescence is a typical Banksia flower spike shape; in B. sect. Banksia because of its straight styles; and B. ser. Tetragonae because of its pendulous inflorescences. He considered its closest relative to be B. aculeata, which has narrower leaves with fewer, larger lobes; longer perianths, which grade from red to cream rather than from cream to red; shorter pistils; and also differences in the follicles, seeds and flowering time. In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published the results of a cladistic analysis of morphological characters of Banksia. They retained George's subgenera and many of his series, but discarded his sections. George's B. ser. Tetragonae was found to be monophyletic, and therefore retained; and their analysis of the relationships within the series supported the placement of B. caleyi alongside B. aculeata. B. caleyis placement in Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement may be summarised as follows: :Banksia ::B. subg. Isostylis (3 species) ::B. elegans (incertae sedis) ::B. subg. Banksia :::B. ser. Tetragonae ::::B. elderiana ::::B. lemanniana ::::B. caleyi ::::B. aculeata The arrangement of Thiele and Ladiges was not accepted by George, and was discarded in his 1999 revision. Under George's 1999 arrangement, B. caleyis placement was as follows: :Banksia ::B. subg. Banksia :::B. sect. Banksia ::::B. ser. Salicinae (11 species, 7 subspecies) ::::B. ser. Grandes (2 species) ::::B. ser. Banksia (8 species) ::::B. ser. Crocinae (4 species) ::::B. ser. Prostratae (6 species, 3 varieties) ::::B. ser. Cyrtostylis (13 species) ::::B. ser. Tetragonae :::::B. lemanniana :::::B. caleyi :::::B. aculeata Since 1998, Austin Mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is rather different from previous taxonomic arrangements, but support the placement of B. aculeata alongside B. caleyi in a clade corresponding closely with B. ser. Tetragonae. Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring Dryandra to Banksia, and publishing B. subg. Spathulatae for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons; in this way, they also redefined the autonym B. subg. Banksia. They have refrained from publishing a full arrangement of Banksia until DNA sampling of Dryandra is complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. caleyi is placed in B. subg. Banksia. Distribution and habitat Distribution in southern Western Australia Banksia caleyi is found near the southern coast of Western Australia, from South Stirling to the West River and northeast to Pingrup. Some of its population lies within Fitzgerald River National Park. pp. 70‚Äì71. Often locally abundant, it is found in mallee woodland on white sand, gravel, and sandy clay, generally on flat or slightly undulating land. The annual rainfall is . Banksia caleyi is classified as Not Threatened under the Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia. Ecology Like many plants in south-west Western Australia, Banksia caleyi is adapted to an environment in which bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: Reseeders are killed by fire, but fire triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation. Resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. B. caleyi belongs to the reseeder group. In the wild, seedlings take at least three to four years to reach flowering after bushfire. Non-patchy fires occurring at intervals of less than seven years may wipe out local populations of reseeders. Banksia caleyi has been shown to have a low susceptibility to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, unlike most Western Australian banksias. The fungal pathogen Botryosphaeria ribis has been recovered from B. caleyi. The caterpillar of the dryandra moth (Carthaea saturnioides) feeds on the leaves, though it prefers to eat those of dryandra species that grow alongside it. The upside-down flower spikes drip nectar onto the ground or lower leaves, suggesting pollination by nonflying mammals which are attracted to the scent. Supporting this hypothesis, the spiky leaves seem to also prevent access to foragers not at ground level. Furthermore, the individual flower structure is similar to Banksia attenuata, for which the honey possum (Tarsipes rostratus) is a major pollinator. Cultivation Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 23 to 50 days to germinate in cultivation. Banksia caleyi is a medium- slow-growing plant, taking four to five years to flower from seed. The flowers are attractive but are obscured by the foliage. This species can grow in a range of soil types so long as they provide good drainage. The nominal soil pH range is from 6 to 7.5. It grows in full sun and partly shaded situations, and tolerates light pruning. Unlike many other Western Australian banksias, Banksia caleyi has had some degree of success in growing in more humid areas, such as Australia's east coast. It attracts pygmy and honey possums in the garden.

In Czech, German and Hungarian settings is venerated as a saint although he never had been officially canonized. Life Gunther was born in around 955 to a noble family, related to the imperial Ottonian dynasty as well as with the Hungarian Arpads. He was a Duke of Thuringia, and is numbered among the ancestors of the princely house of Schwarzburg. He spent the early part of his life at court in the midst of worldly pleasures and ambitious intrigues.Besse, Jean. \\"Blessed Gunther.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 18 Apr. 2013 He was converted in 1005 at the age of fifty by Gotthard of Hildesheim, Abbot of Hersfeld, later Bishop of Hildesheim, and resolved to embrace the monastic life in order to do penance for his past faults. With the consent of his heirs, he bequeathed all his goods to the Abbey of Hersfeld, reserving the right to richly endow and maintain the monastery of G√∂llingen, the ownership of which he persisted in retaining despite all the efforts of Gotthard to prevent him. In 1006, the novice made a pilgrimage to Rome, and in the following year made his vows as lay brother in the monastery of Niederaltaich before the holy Abbot Gotthard. Gunther helped to bring civilization to the region by clearing the forests and planting fields. Soon afterwards, Gunther urgently entreated to be allowed to govern his monastery of G√∂llingen, and Gotthard's remonstrances could not turn him aside from his purpose. Shortly after his elevation to the abbacy, the former lay brother fell ill, and as he could not agree with his monks, the affairs of the monastery were soon in a perilous condition. By his charitable counsels mingled with severe reprimands, Gotthard succeeded in dispelling the ambitious views of Gunther, who returned once more to his humble condition at Niederaltaich, and led an edifying life. In 1008, he withdrew to a wild, steep place near Lalling in the Bavarian Forest, to live there as a hermit. In 1011, he penetrated farther north in the forest with several companions and settled at Rinchnach, where he built cells and a church of St. John Baptist. Here he lived for thirty-four years a life of the greatest poverty and mortification. The very water was measured out to the brothers, guests alone being free to use at as they would. It is said that Gunther received the gift of infused knowledge and became a powerful preacher though deficient in ordinary ecclesiastical learning: he could probably neither read nor write.\\"Saint Gunther\\", Hungarian Saints\\" Wolfher, his biographer, relates that he knew him intimately, and often heard his admirable sermons on his patron, St John the Baptist‚Äîsermons which drew tears from all who heard them. Gunther paid many visits to his relative, Hungarian king, obtained from him large sums for the poor, and urged him to build a number of churches and monasteries. Mabillon has reproduced the deed of donation made by King Stephen on 6 June 1009. In 1029 Conrad II richly endowed the monastery of Rinchnach, and in 1040 Emperor Henry III affiliated it with Niederaltaich Abbey. In his old age, Gunther was highly respected by the rulers of Roman Empire (Germany), Bohemia, Hungary and Poland. This allowed him to successfully negotiate between the Bohemian and German factions in the conflict Duke Bretislaus I of Bohemia and the German king Henry III in 1040. Gunther was likely present at the German defeat in the Battle at Br≈Ødek on 22/23 August 1040, and he was the leader of the delegation negotiating with Bretislaus at Chlumec in the aftermath of the battle.M. Perlbach, Die Kriege Heinrichs III. gegen B√∂hmen. 1039-1041 (1870), 450-452. Gunther died at about the age of ninety in Hartmanice, southwestern Bohemia, on 9 October 1045, in the arms of Duke Bretislaus and of ≈†eb√≠≈ô, Bishop of Prague. He was buried in B≈ôevnov Monastery but his remains were destroyed by the Hussites in 1420. Legacy Church of St. Gunther in Hartmanice-Dobr√° Voda St. Gunther's Way (; ) is a walking holiday route that runs from Niederalteich Abbey on the Danube via Rinchnach and the Guntherstein into Bohemia.Bavarian Walking Holidays Departing from the Niederalteich Monastery on the Danube, the path goes deep into the Bavarian Forest and across the Czech border to hamlet Dobr√° Voda (now part of town Hartmanice). In that hamlet stands the only church in the world dedicated to this person, the Church of Saint Gunther (); built in the years of 1706‚Äì34 and carefully renovated to 1995, on the occasion of 950 years since the saint's death. During the reconstruction, interior of the church was newly created by Czech artist Vladim√≠ra Tesa≈ôov√° in a unique way: altar, sacrificial table, lectern, cr√®che, Stations of the Cross and the statue of Gunther himself are all cast from glass. Also in Hungary can be found a reminder of Gunther: one of the two main churches in the town M√≥r, the Church of Holy Trinity (), has a Baroque Gunther's statue (from 1744) in a niche on the right side of its portal facade.See photo of portal facade and detail of the statue References Category:950s births Category:1045 deaths Category:German Christian monks Category:11th-century Christian mystics Category:Roman Catholic mystics Category:Czech Roman Catholic saints Category:Hungarian Roman Catholic saints Category:Hermits ","title":"Gunther of Bohemia"},{"id":"5689694","text":"Banksia canei, commonly known as the mountain banksia, is a species of shrub that is endemic to southeastern Australia. It is generally encountered as a many-branched shrub that grows up to high, with narrow leaves and the yellow inflorescences (flower spikes) appearing from late summer to early winter. The old flowers fall off the spikes, and up to 150 finely furred follicles develop, which remain closed until burnt in a bushfire. Each follicle bears two winged seeds. Response to fire is poorly known, although it is thought to regenerate by seed. Birds such as the yellow-tufted honeyeater and various insects forage among the flower spikes. It is frost tolerant in cultivation, but copes less well with aridity or humidity, and is often short-lived in gardens. One cultivar, Banksia 'Celia Rosser', was registered in 1978, but has subsequently vanished. Although no subspecies are recognised, four topodemes (geographically isolated populations) have been described, as there is significant variation in the shape of both adult and juvenile leaves between populations. Although superficially resembling B. marginata, it is more closely related to another subalpine species, B. saxicola. Description Banksia canei grows as a woody shrub to in height, usually with many branches. Its bark is smooth with horizontal lenticels, initially reddish-brown before fading to grey tones. The stiff leaves are arranged alternately along the stems and show significant variation in shape and size. Adult leaves are linear or narrowly obovate in shape, and generally measure , though some populations have leaves as short as or as long as . The juvenile leaves are generally larger and wider with dentate margins.Salkin, p. 170. New growth is seen mainly from February to April. The complex flower spikes, known as inflorescences, appear between December and May, peaking over February to April. They arise from nodes of 1‚Äì3-year-old branchlets or can be terminal. Cylindrical in shape, they are composed of a central woody spike, from which a large number of compact floral units arise perpendicularly to it. They are generally high and wide, but some do reach high. Mauve-tinted in bud, they generally open to become pale yellow in colour. As with most banksias, anthesis is acropetal; the opening of the individual buds proceeds up the flower spike from the base to the top. The flower limbs may be pale grey or blue-tinged, while the styles are yellow. As the inflorescences age, the old flowers fall away, leaving a naked spike. Up to 150 follicles develop, each covered in short fine fur which is initially pale brown but fades to green- grey and partly wears away. More or less elliptic in shape, they measure long, high, and wide, and mostly remain closed until burnt by fire, although a few may open after several years. They contain two fertile seeds each, between which lies a woody dark brown separator of similar shape to the seeds. Measuring in length, the seed is obovate, and composed of a dark brown -wide membranous 'wing' and crescent-shaped (lunate) seed proper which measures long by wide. The seed surface can be smooth or covered in tiny ridges, and often glistens. The resulting seedling first grows two obovate cotyledon leaves, which may remain for several months as several more leaves appear. Taxonomy Banksia canei was first described in 1967 by James H. Willis, who had collected it on 27 November 1962 along the Mt. Seldom Seen track in the vicinity of Wulgulmerang, Victoria. Earlier collections include a specimen Ferdinand von Mueller had collected near Omeo in 1853, and one found by Richard Hind Cambage in 1908 near Kydra Peak. However, neither botanist considered this to be a new species at the time, instead holding it to be an unusual mountain form of the locally widespread B. marginata. Willis named the species after Victorian plantsman Bill Cane who had alerted authorities to the existence of an unusual banksia that was distinct from B. marginata some years previously. At the time, a plant collected from Mount Fulton near Port Davey in South West Tasmania was thought to be B. canei, but it was later reassessed as B. marginata. B. canei can be distinguished by its larger follicles and sharp points to the leaves. In his 1981 monograph of the genus Banksia, Alex George noted that despite a superficial resemblance to B. marginata, its bare old cones and stouter foliage indicated a closer relationship to B. integrifolia and B. saxicola, although it lacks the latter species' whorled leaf arrangement. A fossil species, B. kingii from the late Pleistocene of Melaleuca Inlet in southwestern Tasmania, has robust foliage and infructescence resembling those of B. canei and B. saxicola, and appears to be a recently extinct relative. The leaf of a much older fossil species Banksieaephyllum acuminatum from Oligocene deposits in the Latrobe Valley closely resembles B. canei in shape, anatomy and vein pattern.Salkin, p. 151. The current taxonomic arrangement of the genus Banksia is based on botanist Alex George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this arrangement, B. canei is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, because its inflorescences take the form of Banksia's characteristic flower spikes; section Banksia because of its straight styles; and series Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. Kevin Thiele placed it in a subseries Integrifoliae, where he found strong support for it and B. saxicola to be each other's closest relative. The two were a sister group (i.e. next closest relative) to the four then-recognised subspecies of B. integrifolia. The subseries all bear whorled leaves apart from B. canei and B. aquilonia. However, this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George. He did place the two subalpine taxa (B. canei and B. saxicola) at the end of the sequence as he thought they were the most recently evolved species, since he considered the group to have a tropical origin and B. dentata to be the oldest lineage. bare infructescence, showing furry follicles B. canei's placement within Banksia may be summarised as follows: :Genus Banksia ::Subgenus Isostylis ::Subgenus Banksia :::Section Oncostylis :::Section Coccinea :::Section Banksia ::::Series Grandes ::::Series Banksia ::::Series Crocinae ::::Series Prostratae ::::Series Cyrtostylis ::::Series Tetragonae ::::Series Bauerinae ::::Series Quercinae ::::Series Salicinae :::::B. dentata ‚Äì B. aquilonia ‚Äì B. integrifolia ‚Äì B. plagiocarpa ‚Äì B. oblongifolia ‚Äì B. robur ‚Äì B. conferta ‚Äì B. paludosa ‚Äì B. marginata ‚Äì B. canei ‚Äì B. saxicola Since 1998, American botanist Austin Mast and co-authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae, which then comprised genera Banksia and Dryandra. Their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from George's taxonomic arrangement. Banksia canei resolves as an early offshoot within the series Salicinae. Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele rearranged the genus Banksia by merging Dryandra into it, and published B. subg. Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons; thus B. subg. Banksia was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. canei is placed in B. subg. Spathulatae. Distribution and habitat Distribution of Banksia canei across Victoria and far southeastern New South Wales Several disjunct populations of Banksia canei have been recorded across alpine areas of southeastern Australia, generally at altitudes of in northeastern Victoria and southeastern New South Wales. One outlier at a lower altitude has been found on land partly cleared for agriculture at elevation at Yowrie. The species is listed as \\"Rare in Victoria\\" on the Department of Sustainability and Environment's Advisory List of Rare Or Threatened Plants In Victoria. In a 1978 paper reviewing the species, Alf Salkin coined the term topodeme to indicate a geographically isolated population of plants, derived from the Ancient Greek words topos \\"place\\" and deme \\"people\\" or \\"county (population)\\". Salkin described four populations (topodemes), each found in granite-based rocky soils in subalpine regions, and isolated from one another by wide river valleys. They would have occupied lower altitudes at cooler geological periods and higher altitudes in warmer times.Salkin, p. 147. Each of the main four populations varies from the others in their leaf morphology. Salkin observed that as the habitat and environment was similar across the range, the differences were secondary to genetic drift, as certain traits have begun to dominate over others by chance as the populations begin to diverge genetically. Most populations are located south or east of the Great Dividing Range, the exception being the Snowy Mountains population. The Kybean Range population is contiguous, while the others are fragmented. From west to east the populations are: *The Wellington River form, in the Snowy Range from Mount Howitt southwards to an area between the Moroka and Barkly Rivers. The Wonnangatta Mitchell system separates this form from the Wulgulmerang form to the east.Salkin, p. 148. The margins of the adult leaves are prominently dentate (toothed), much more so than other forms which may have occasional 'teeth' here and there. The flower has a distinctive blue-grey limb. *The Snowy Mountains form, found to the north of the Snowy Mountains and west of the Australian Capital Territory, Talbingo and Corryong in the Bogong Peaks. This is separated by the Murray River to the south. This form has the smallest infructescences, measuring high and wide.Salkin, p. 171. The adult leaves are long, while the flowers are small, with perianths only long. Like those of the Wellington River form, the flower limbs are blue-grey. *The Wulgulmerang form, located to the north and east of Omeo, to Wulgulmerang and the Little River. The flower limb is a more yellow-brown and the infructescences resemble those of B. marginata. It is found among granite rocks in association with the candlebark (Eucalyptus rubida). *The Kybean Range form, in southeastern New South Wales ‚Äì located in the Kybean Range and Tuross River east of Cooma. The Snowy River separates this form from the Wulgulmerang form to the west. This form has the largest flower spikes and infructescences, measuring up to high and wide. It has very short adult leaves, yet wide juvenile leaves that resemble Banksia integrifolia. There is one report of naturalisation in Western Australia, near Jerramungup, on a road verge. Ecology Banksia flower spikes are important sources of nectar for mammals, insects and birds, particularly honeyeaters. Animals recorded foraging among the flower spikes of B. canei include the yellow-tufted honeyeater (Lichenostomus melanops), and bees, wasps and ants. Banksia canei lacks a lignotuber and appears to regenerate from bushfire by seed, although its response to fire has been little studied. The follicles remain closed until burnt, although some do open spontaneously after five years or so. The fungus Banksiamyces toomansis, of the order Helotiales, infects older cones and seed, and hence seed older than about five years is often not viable. Plectronidium australiense is a species of anamorphic fungus that was recovered from a dead branch of B. canei at Healesville Sanctuary and described in 1986. Use in horticulture Banksia canei is somewhat slow-growing in cultivation, and takes around five to seven years to flower from seed. Its furry-follicled fruiting cones are attractive, although generally obscured by foliage. Although grown successfully in England and tolerant of temperatures to , Banksia canei has a reputation of being difficult to keep alive in Australian gardens. Plants often grow well as seedlings in pots, but perish once planted in the ground. It is tolerant to frost, but not to aridity or possibly more humid conditions. The species prefers a sunny aspect and fair drainage. It has been grown in inland New South Wales on the Southern Tablelands and Rylstone. Banksia canei seed requires stratification‚Äîstoring at for 60 days‚Äîbefore it germinates, which takes a further 6 to 25 days. Salkin proposed this was necessary so that seed released in a summer or autumn bushfire would lie dormant over the winter months before germinating in the spring. Banksia saxicola and some Banksia marginata seeds of subalpine provenance also share this trait. In 1975, as part of a study on the four populations of B. canei, Salkin carried out germination experiments, producing around a thousand seedlings. In January that year, two seedlings from the Wulgulmerang population displayed deeply lobed (pinnatisect) leaves and a prostrate habit. One died, but in April two seedlings from the Wellington River seed appeared which bore the same appearance. Both these younger seedlings died, but the one older plant survived. It was propagated and registered as a cultivar Banksia 'Celia Rosser' on 28 May 1978, named in honour of Celia Rosser, an artist who has illustrated many banksias. It produced flower spikes high and wide, which made up for their small size by their abundance. Salkin felt its importance lay not in its horticultural potential but in its appearance in two geographically distant populations. He felt it represented the reappearance of an earlier (possibly ancestral) form, representing \\"allelomorphs all but lost\\".Salkin, p. 150. However, the cultivar has since vanished.

Plot Private detectives Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy travel from their hometown of Peoria, Illinois to Mexico City in pursuit of an infamous female larcenist named Hattie Blake (Carol Andrews), who is publicly known as ‚ÄùLarceny Nell‚Äù. Meanwhile, an American sports promoter, Richard K. Muldoon (Ralph Sanford) meets with publicity man ‚ÄùHot Shot‚Äù Coleman (Richard Lane), and his assistant (Irving Gump) to discuss an upcoming bullfight featuring famed Spanish matador Don Sebastian. But when Muldoon sees pictures of the bullfighter he becomes enraged; Don Sebastian looks exactly like Laurel. Hot Shot is confused until Muldoon tells him the story: Eight years earlier in Peoria, Laurel and Hardy both testified against Muldoon in a criminal case, and Muldoon was wrongfully convicted of the crime (the details of which were never specified) and granted a twenty-year jail sentence; However, after five years the true criminal confessed to the crime and Muldoon was released. While in prison, though, he had lost his wife and business and he had to start all over in Mexico. He still holds a grudge against Stan and Ollie and vows revenge with a large knife for emphasis: \\"Someday I'll run across them again! And when I do, I'm going to skin them alive! First the little one, then the big one! I'll skin them both alive!!\\" Meanwhile, Ollie and Stan confront Blake in an attempt to arrest her only for her to snatch the papers that permit them to arrest her outside the U.S., followed by an egg-breaking tit for tat sequence before she escape. They run into Hot Shot who sees Stan's uncanny resemblance to the bullfighter while receiving a telegram that tells the real Don Sebastian's arrival is delayed because of passport trouble. After explaining Stan's resemblance to Don Sebastian to the confused Ollie and Stan and about the vengeful Muldoon's wrongful conviction, Hot Shot forces Stan to impersonate the bullfighter in the meantime, threatening to reveal his and Ollie's presence to Muldoon if he doesn't cooperate but promising them a very handsome payment for their trouble if he does. Stan reluctantly agrees, only because Hot Shot promises he won't have to fight bulls. Eventually, the real Don Sebastian's passport trouble turns out to be worse than originally feared and so Stan will have to take his place in the ring and fight bulls after all. On the day of the fight Stan, nervous about fighting bulls, gets drunk. But then, unbeknownst to anyone, the real Don Sebastian has somehow miraculously contrived to making it to Mexico City just in time for the big bullfight. Ollie mistakes him for Stan and forces him into the arena. Stan staggers up, and Hardy sends him into battle. With two Laurels in the ring, the outraged spectators cry foul, especially Muldoon, who now recognizes \\"Don Sebastian\\" as Stan Laurel from Peoria who sent him up for twenty years and, in a livid frenzy, punches out Hot Shot, calling him a swindler. Every bull in the arena is then unleashed. Stan and Ollie try to escape the vengeful Muldoon, but not fast enough; Stan and Ollie, while packing for their flight back home and planning to sneak away to the airport, discover Muldoon hiding in their closet, his knife handy. Just as promised, he skins them alive; leaving them, except their heads, in bare bones. Ollie says his \\"another nice mess‚Ä¶\\" catchphrase to Stan. Stan whimpers before Ollie decides that they go back home to Peoria, \\"where we belong!\\" Production Laurel wrote and directed portions of the feature.,MacGillivray, Scott, Laurel & Hardy: From the Forties Forward (Second Edition); iUniverse, 2009 which was produced in late 1944 and released in May 1945.

This was Laurel and Hardy's last American film and also the film debut of Frank McCown, who later became famous as Rory Calhoun. Laurel and Hardy were scheduled to make another film for 20th Century-Fox in the spring of 1945, but the studio discontinued all B-picture production at the end of 1944 and closed the Laurel and Hardy unit.

Description Banksia conferta is a shrub that typically grows to a height of but does not form a lignotuber. It has rough, grey, tessellated bark on the trunk and orange, red or brown stems that are hairy at first. The leaves are arranged in whorls and are elliptic to egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, long and wide with the edges curved downwards and sometimes serrated. The flowers are crowded in a cylindrical spike long with involucral bracts long at the base. The flowers are yellowish green to pinkish brown in the bud stage, turning golden yellow when open. The perianth is long and the pistil is long and slightly curved. Flowering occurs from late April to July and the fruit is a narrow elliptical follicle long, high and wide. More than 100 follicles often form in each spike, surrounded by the remains of the flowers. The follicles remain until the plant is burned, unlike those of the similar B. integrifolia which also has less crowded flowers. Taxonomy and naming Banksia conferta was first formally described in 1981 by Alex George in the journal Nuytsia from specimens he collected from Mount Tibrogargan in the Glass House Mountains National Park in 1975. The specific epithet (conferta) is a Latin word meaning \\"crowded\\". In the same journal, George described variety conferta and var. penicillata, and in 1996 he described subspecies conferta and subsp. penicillata. He described subsp. conferta as being found in southern Queensland on the Lamington Plateau and the Glass House Mountains and subsp. penicillata from Bowral to north of Lithgow in New South Wales. In 1996, Kevin Thiele raised subsp. penicillata to species status as B. penicillata in Australian Systematic Botany, so that var. conferta and subsp. conferta became synonyms of B. conferta.

It occurs across northern Australia, southern New Guinea and the Aru Islands. Growing as a gnarled tree to high, it has large green leaves up to long with dentate (toothed) margins. The cylindrical yellow inflorescences (flower spikes), up to high, appear over the cooler months, attracting various species of honeyeaters, sunbirds, the sugar glider and a variety of insects. Flowers fall off the ageing spikes, which swell and develop follicles containing up to two viable seeds each. Banksia dentata is one of four Banksia species collected by Sir Joseph Banks in 1770, and one of the four species published in 1782 as part of Carolus Linnaeus the Younger's original description of Banksia. Within the genus, it is classified in the series Salicinae, a group of species from Australia's eastern states. Genetic studies show it is a basal member (early offshoot) within the group. Banksia dentata is found in tropical grassland known as savanna, associated with Pandanus and Melaleuca. It regenerates from bushfire by regrowing from its woody base, known as a lignotuber. Description The tropical banksia is generally a small tree which grows to around or sometimes tall, with a rough stocky trunk, spreading crown, and crooked branches. The dark grey bark is not flaky but tesselated in texture and appearance. Initially covered in reddish hair that wears away, branchlets become smooth and grey with age. The large green leaves are scattered along the stems, and more crowded at the branchlet tips. They are long and wide, obovate in shape with mucronate tips. The dentate (toothed) margins are lined irregularly with long teeth, separated by u-shaped sinuses. The leaves are undulate (wavy) with white undersurfaces, the midrib raised underneath and depressed above. The cylindrical yellow inflorescences (flower spikes), arise from one- to three-year-old branches. Appearing between November and May, they are high and wide. Newly opened flower spikes smell like corn. All flower parts are pale yellow; the perianth is long, including a long limb. After anthesis, the pistil is long. Flower parts soon fall off ageing spikes, which develop into irregular-cylindrical infructescences. The oval follicles are long, high and wide. Pale green and furry when young, they become smooth and pale brown with age. The follicles open spontaneously with maturity. They contain two seeds each, between which lies a woody dark brown separator of similar shape to the seeds. Measuring in length, the seed is obovate, and composed of a dark brown wide membranous 'wing' and obovate seed proper which measures long by wide. The seed surface can be smooth or covered in tiny ridges. The bright green cotyledons are obovate, measuring long by wide. At the base of each are two pointed auricles around 1.5 mm long. The cotyledons arise from a 3‚Äì4 mm high smooth hypocotyl that is 1‚Äì1.5 mm in diameter. The subsequent seedling leaves are opposite initially, arising 3‚Äì4 mm above the cotyledons. Each is roughly linear in shape, measuring long and wide, with two to three serrations (\\"teeth\\") on the upper quarter to third of the leaf margin's length. The leaf undersurface is covered with white hair. Successive leaves become more obovate and are long and wide, with dentate margins and mucronate tips. Seedling stems are hairy. Taxonomy Specimens of Banksia dentata were collected from the vicinity of the Endeavour River somewhere between 17 June and 3 August 1770 by Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander, naturalists on the Endeavour during Lieutenant (later Captain) James Cook's first voyage to the Pacific Ocean. However, the description of the species was not published until April 1782, when Carolus Linnaeus the Younger described the first four Banksia species in his Supplementum Plantarum. Linnaeus distinguished them by their leaf shapes, and named them accordingly. Thus this species' dentate (toothed) leaf margins saw it given the specific name dentata, the Latin adjective for \\"toothed\\". Banksia dentata is monotypic, and no subspecies are recognised. Though not closely studied, reports suggest it does not vary significantly over its range. Robert Brown recorded 31 species of Banksia in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen, and in his taxonomic arrangement, placed the taxon in the subgenus Banksia verae, the \\"True Banksias\\", because the inflorescence is a typical Banksia flower spike. By the time Carl Meissner published his 1856 arrangement of the genus, there were 58 described Banksia species. Meissner divided Brown's Banksia verae, which had been renamed Eubanksia by Stephan Endlicher in 1847, into four series based on leaf properties. He placed B. dentata in the series Quercinae (the oak-like banksias). In 1870, George Bentham published a thorough revision of Banksia in his Flora Australiensis. In Bentham's arrangement, the number of recognised Banksia species was reduced from 60 to 46. Bentham defined four sections based on leaf, style and pollen- presenter characters. Banksia dentata was placed in section Eubanksia alongside B. marginata and a broadly defined B. integrifolia. A major disruption to Banksia nomenclature occurred in 1891, when Otto Kuntze challenged Banksia L.f. on the grounds that Johann Reinhold Forster and his son Georg had already penned the name Banksia to describe a different genus of plant, and hence Banksia J.R.Forst & G. Forst took precedence and rendered Banksia L.f. (i.e. as used by Linnaeus) invalid. Kuntze transferred all Banksia taxa to the new name Sirmuellera; thus B. dentata became Sirmuellera dentata (L.f.) Kuntze. Kuntze's challenge failed, as did a similar challenge by James Britten in 1905. Britten proposed the generic name Isostylis, republishing B. dentata as Isostylis dentata (L.f.) Britten. In 1940 Banksia L.f. was formally conserved against future challenges. Commonly known as the tropical banksia, B. dentata is known locally as swamp banksia, and guibuk by the indigenous people in Kakadu National Park. Its local name in the Nunggubuyu language of eastern Arnhem Land is rilirdili. Other names from the same region include Enindurrkwa in the Enindhilyagwa language of Groote Eylandt, and gulpu in the Rirratjingu language of Yirrkala. Frederick Manson Bailey reported in 1913 that the indigenous people of Cape Bedford knew it as kabir. =Placement within Banksia= The current taxonomic arrangement of the genus Banksia is based on botanist Alex George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this arrangement, B. dentata is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, because its inflorescences take the form of Banksia's characteristic flower spikes, section Banksia because of its straight styles, and series Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. There has been debate on which species it is most closely related to. Alf Salkin had noted that B. dentata displays characteristics which are primitive within the genus. Unlike southern banksias, it has small juvenile leaves and broad dentate adult leaves.Salkin (1979), p. 161. Alex George concluded initially that its affinities lay with Banksia integrifolia on account of their similar inflorescences. In a morphological cladistic analysis published in 1994, Kevin Thiele placed it in the newly described subseries Acclives along with B. plagiocarpa, B. robur and B. oblongifolia within the series Salicinae. These four species all have follicles which point slightly upwards towards the apex of the flower spike. It was held to be most closely related to B. robur on account of its large undulate leaves. Salkin had also noted that the seedling leaves of B. dentata, B. robur and B. oblongifolia were all similar and roughly linear, suggesting a close relationship.Salkin (1979), p. 163. However, this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George; he discounted a close relationship with B. robur, which he felt was too distinctive. B. dentata's placement within Banksia according to Flora of Australia is as follows: :Genus Banksia ::Subgenus Isostylis ::Subgenus Banksia :::Section Oncostylis :::Section Coccinea :::Section Banksia ::::Series Grandes ::::Series Banksia ::::Series Crocinae ::::Series Prostratae ::::Series Cyrtostylis ::::Series Tetragonae ::::Series Bauerinae ::::Series Quercinae ::::Series Salicinae :::::B. dentata ‚Äì B. aquilonia ‚Äì B. integrifolia ‚Äì B. plagiocarpa ‚Äì B. oblongifolia ‚Äì B. robur ‚Äì B. conferta ‚Äì B. paludosa ‚Äì B. marginata ‚Äì B. canei ‚Äì B. saxicola Since 1998, American botanist Austin Mast and co-authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae, which then comprised genera Banksia and Dryandra. Their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from George's taxonomic arrangement. Banksia dentata resolves as an early offshoot within the Salicinae. In 2007, Mast and Thiele rearranged the genus Banksia by merging Dryandra into it, and published B. subg. Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons; thus B. subg. Banksia was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, B. dentata is placed in B. subg. Spathulatae. Distribution and habitat Across northern Australia, Banksia dentata has been recorded as far west as the King Leopold Ranges in the western Kimberley through the Northern Territory and extending south to Katherine Gorge and into Queensland, where it is found on the Cape York Peninsula to as far south as Cooktown. Off the coast, it has been recorded from Groote Eylandt and the Wessel Islands, as well as Melville and Bathurst Islands. It also extends onto the Aru Islands, where it is found around Trangan, and New Guinea, where it ranges in the south from Merauke east to Port Moresby, and around Bulolo and Mount Mau. It is the only Banksia species not endemic to Australia. As much of its range is in remote and poorly surveyed country, it is possible that it is found more widely than has been recorded. Pollen samples indicate it has been present on the Torres Strait Islands over the past 8000 years, though it has not been a prominent component of the island flora. Banksia dentata generally grows on sandy soils in savanna woodland or shrubland, along freshwater swamps, watercourses, floodplains or other seasonally wet areas. It has also been found on rocky outcrops, of quartzite or sandstone, to an elevation of around in Australia, and up to in New Guinea. In New Guinea it is restricted to areas which have a distinct dry season. Banksia dentata is often found with Melaleuca and Pandanus species. On Cape York, it is a dominant component in a low scrub known as \\"wet desert\\" due to its resemblance to arid scrub yet occurring in a monsoon climate. On phosphorus-poor soils, Banksia dentata is found with Melaleuca saligna and Thryptomene oligandra. On Melville Island it is a dominant component of Banksia low woodland, forming part of a high canopy with Melaleuca viridiflora; the understory is composed of sedges such as Fimbristylis, Sorghum intrans, Eriachne, Germainia grandiflora and the restiad Dapsilanthus spathaceus, as well as suckering shrubs Lophostemon lactifluus and Syzygium eucalyptoides. This community grows in wet areas, with a grey topsoil with high moisture and gravel content but low sand. Ecology Banksia dentata responds to bushfire by resprouting from its woody lignotuber although, unlike other members of the Salicinae, it lacks dormant buds at its base. It was described by amateur botanist and banksia enthusiast Alf Salkin as resembling an \\"upturned parsnip\\".Salkin (1979), p. 154. Plant communities where it is found are subject to periodic bushfires, and it can become more dominant if fires occur often. Salkin had noted that its tropical position might mean that B. dentata was a key species in the transition from rainforest to open habitat in the ancestry of the genus. One adaptation to a drier sunnier climate was a thick intermediate layer under the epidermis in the leaf architecture. This layer, the hypodermis, contains large vacuoles that are filled with a phenolic compound, and seems to serve to reduce the intensity of sunlight reaching the mesophyll.Salkin (1979), p. 162. Numerous nectar-feeding insects are attracted to the flower spikes, which in turn attract honeyeaters, silvereyes and sunbirds, many of which consume both nectar and insects. The sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) forages among the flower spikes and is a probable pollinator. The common blossom bat (Syconycteris australis) feeds on nectar. B. dentata has been recorded as a host plant for the mistletoe species Amyema benthamii, Decaisnina angustata and D. signata. Cultivation alt=two potted seedlings with large trunks The tree's gnarled bark, large green leaves, and yellow flower spikes are attractive horticultural features. B. dentata is vulnerable to cold winters in cultivation in Melbourne and recovers over the hotter months of summer.Salkin (1979), pp. 159‚Äì60. It has not been able to be grown in colder climates, such as those of Canberra. Flowering occurs around 5 to 8 years from seed. Plants can be pruned hard, and do best on a sandy slightly acid soil of pH 5.5‚Äì6.5. They can be vulnerable to borers. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 32 to 40 days to germinate. Banksia dentata was introduced into the United Kingdom in 1822. Banksia dentata is used as a nectar source in the honey bee industry. Aborigines in the Northern Territory would light old seed cones and use them as firebrands, these lasting for up to two hours. The nectar was consumed by indigenous people. A hot smoking flower spike was used to cauterise leprosy sores, and people suffering from diarrhea would squat over smoking cones in the hope this would relieve their symptoms. The thin woody spikes that did not develop follicles were used as nasal ornaments by aboriginal women, and flower spikes were used as combs.

The Noongar peoples know the tree as manyat. It occurs in shrubland, woodland and kwongan on the south coast of Western Australia between Narrikup and Beaufort Inlet. The species is placed alone in series B. ser. Dryandroideae. Description Banksia dryandroides is a much- branched, spreading shrub to high, and does not form a lignotuber. The stems are covered with fine reddish hair, and the fernlike leaves are long and wide. The squat cylindrical inflorescences appear from October to January and are high. They are pale brownish in colour with hooked pistils. The flowers remain on the ageing spikes as up to 25 follicles develop. These measure long, high, and wide, covered in fine hairs below, and smooth above. Taxonomy =Discovery and naming= Edwin Dalton Smith's engraving of B. dryandroides, accompanying the original publication of the species in Robert Sweet's 1828 Flora Australasica. Specimens of B. dryandroides were first collected in 1823 from the vicinity of King George Sound by William Baxter, a private plant collector who collected plant specimens and seed on behalf of British nurseries.Collins (2008): 6‚Äì9. Baxter sent to Clapton Nursery a package of Banksia seed labelled \\"Dryandroides\\", and this was successfully germinated. The species became part of \\"the collection of Mr Mackay, at Clapton\\", before being procured for \\"the superb collection of the Comtesse de Vandes', at Bayswater\\", where it flowered in cultivation for the first time. There it was seen by Robert Sweet, who in 1826 listed it under the unpublished manuscript name \\"Banksia dryandroides\\" as having been in cultivation in British gardens since 1824. Two years later, Sweet published a formal description of the species in his Flora Australasica, accompanied by a hand-coloured engraving by Edwin Dalton Smith. Thus B. dryandroides became the first published of the 18 Banksia species discovered by Baxter; the remaining 17 would be published in Robert Brown's 1830 Supplementum primum Prodromi florae Novae Hollandiae, based on Baxter's specimen sheets.Baxter discovered 10 species of Banksia sensu stricto; see Collins (2008): 8. He also discovered 8 species of what was then the genus Dryandra, but is now B. ser. Dryandra; see . Sweet attributed the specific epithet dryandroides to Baxter, hence the species' full name with author citation is Banksia dryandroides Baxter ex Sweet. (The Australian Plant Census is a list of currently accepted scientific names of Australian vascular plants, as endorsed by the Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria (CHAH).) The etymology of dryandroides was not explicitly given, but Sweet offered the English common name Dryandra-like Banksia. The specific epithet is now held to mean \\"Dryandra-like\\", from the genus Dryandra and the suffix -oides (\\"similar\\"), in reference to the similarity of the leaves to some species of B. ser. Dryandra (formerly given genus rank as Dryandra).Collins (2008): 191‚Äì192. Sweet did not designate a type specimen for the species. Australian botanist Alex George has since designated as neotype one of Baxter's specimen sheets located at the British Museum (Natural History), labelled \\"Banksia new Seeds marked Dryandroides\\".George (1981): 414‚Äì416. The species has an uneventful taxonomic history and no subspecies or varieties have been identified. The nomenclatural synonym Sirmuellera dryandroides (Sweet.) Kuntze arose from Otto Kuntze's unsuccessful 1891 attempt to transfer Banksia into the new name Sirmuellera. =Infrageneric placement= Sweet placed B. dryandroides in Robert Brown's Banksia verae, an unranked subgroup of Banksia, defined as containing all species with an elongate flower spike. Brown endorsed this when he updated his arrangement of Banksia in his 1830 Supplementum, placing it between B. repens (Creeping Banksia) and B. brownii (Feather-leaved Banksia).Brown (1830): 36‚Äì37. Banksia verae was renamed Eubanksia by Stephan Endlicher in 1847. Carl Meissner gave Eubanksia sectional rank in his 1856 arrangement, and divided it into four series based on leaf characters, with B. dryandroides placed in series Dryandroideae because its leaves are divided into lobes.Meissner (1856): 465. When George Bentham published a revised arrangement in his 1870 Flora Australiensis, he discarded Meissner's series, placing all the species with hooked styles together in a section that he named Oncostylis. This arrangement would stand for over a century. Alex George published a new taxonomic arrangement of Banksia in his landmark 1981 monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae). Endlicher's Eubanksia became B. subg. Banksia, and was divided into three sections, one of which was Oncostylis. Oncostylis was further divided into four series, with B. dryandroides placed alone in the resurrected B. ser. Dryandroideae. Though George did not accept Meissner's definition of the series, he argued that \\"Banksia dryandroides appears to provide a link between the Spicigerae and the Abietinae but is sufficiently distinct from both to be placed in its own series.\\" In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published a new arrangement of Banksia, after cladistic analyses yielded a cladogram significantly different from George's arrangement. George's sections were discarded, but many of his series were retained. Thiele and Ladiges found B. dryandroides to be sister (that is, the next closest relative) to a clade containing B. ser. Abietinae and B. tricuspis (Lesueur Banksia). Since this placement was consistent with the placement of B. dryandroides alone in a series, and on the stated principle that \\"[n]omenclatural changes from the currently accepted classification are minimised\\", Thiele and Ladiges retained the placement of B. dryandroides alone in series Dryandroideae.Thiele and Ladiges (1996). George revised Banksia again in his 1999 monograph of the genus for the Flora of Australia series. Questioning the emphasis on cladistics in Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement, George published a slightly modified version of his 1981 arrangement. To date, this remains the most recent comprehensive arrangement of the genus. Under George's 1999 arrangement of Banksia, B. dryandroides's taxonomic placement may be summarised as follows:George (1999). :Banksia ::B. subg. Banksia :::B. sect. Banksia (9 series, 50 species, 9 subspecies, 3 varieties) :::B. sect. Coccinea (1 species) :::B. sect. Oncostylis ::::B. ser. Spicigerae (7 species, 2 subspecies, 4 varieties) ::::B. ser. Tricuspidae (1 species) ::::B. ser. Dryandroideae :::::B. dryandroides ::::B. ser. Abietinae (13 species, 2 subspecies, 9 varieties) ::B. subg. Isostylis (3 species) Since 1998, American botanist Austin Mast and coauthors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the Proteaceae subtribe Banksiinae, which includes Banksia. Their 2002 analysis inferred a tree in which B. dryandroides was sister to a clade containing B. pulchella (Teasel Banksia) and B. meisneri var. adscendens. This clade was in turn part of a polytomy with a clade containing series Grandes, and a clade containing the bulk of series Abietinae. Further analyses published in 2005 yielded results largely consistent with this, except that B. tricuspis may be much more closely related to this species than previously thought. Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of Banksiinae by combining Dryandra, the only other genus besides it, and Banksia and publishing several new names, including subgenus Spathulatae for the species of Banksia that have spoon- shaped cotyledons. They have not yet published a full arrangement, but if their nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. prionotes is placed in B. subg. Spathulatae. Distribution and habitat Distribution of B. dryandroides within Western Australia Banksia dryandroides ranges near the south coast of Western Australia from Narrikup to Beaufort Inlet. It grows in clay-loam, sandy loam or gravel-based soils on low-lying areas, in shrubland and low woodland. It is also found on sandstone-based elevated areas in kwongan habitat. Ecology Banksia dryandroides is killed by fire and regenerates from seed. New plants need at least four years between fires to flower and set fruit. It is moderately sensitive to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback. An assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that its range is likely to contract by between 30% and 80% by 2080, depending on the severity of the change. Cultivation Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 30 to 80 days to germinate.

It is a tangled, bushy shrub with stiff, serrated leaves and spikes of yellow flowers . It occurs in two disjunct areas in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia. One population extends over a large area from west of Kalgoorlie south to Ravensthorpe, with another population in the Great Victoria Desert north of the Queen Victoria Spring. Description Banksia elderiana grows as a tangled and bushy shrub to 3 m (10 ft) in height, with new growth covered densely with brown fur. The stiff linear narrow leaves are very long and curled, measuring 15 to 40 cm (6‚Äì16 in) long and 1.2‚Äì2 cm (0.5-0.8 in) wide. The leaf margins are serrated, with many teeth measuring 0.3 to 0.5 cm each. Flowering typically occurs between January and March, but may continue into winter. The all-yellow inflorescences hang down from branchlets and measure 4‚Äì6 cm (1.6‚Äì2.4 in) in length. The inflorescences turn grey as they age, and the old flowers remain as up to 30 large woody follicles develop. Oval in shape, and covered with fine hair, they can reach 2.5 cm long 1.4 cm high, and 1.8 cm wide. Taxonomy Banksia elderiana was first collected on the Elder Exploring Expedition on 17 September 1891 by Richard Helms, from a location around northeast of Queen Victoria Spring in the Great Victoria Desert. It was formally described by Ferdinand von Mueller and Ralph Tate in 1893 in the journal Botanisches CentralBlatt. Its specific name honours Sir Thomas Elder, who sponsored the expedition during which it was collected. Alex George placed Banksia elderiana in the series Cyrtostylis, and felt its closest relative to be B. lullfitzii on the basis of its similar leaves and propensity of both to form tangled shrubs. However, he conceded was heterogeneous, and also noted its affinities with the series Tetragonae, containing other banksias with upside down inflorescences such as B. lemanniana, B. caleyi and B. aculeata. In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published the results of a cladistic analysis of morphological characters of Banksia. They retained George's subgenera and many of his series, but discarded his sections. George's B. ser. Cyrtostylis they found to be polyphyletic, a collection of species more closely related to others than each other. They united B. elderiana with the Tetragonae on the basis of upside down inflorescences and straight styles that do not bend once freed from the perianth at anthesis, a feature not seen in many other banksia species. B. elderianas placement in Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement may be summarised as follows: :Banksia ::B. subg. Isostylis (3 species) ::B. elegans (incertae sedis) ::B. subg. Banksia :::B. ser.

Abietinae (4 subseries, 15 species, 8 varieties) Distribution and habitat Banksia elderiana is found in two disjunct regions, the larger being a broad area between Hyden in the west and Salmon Gums west of Kalgoorlie to the east. Then, it is found northeast of Queen Victoria Spring in the Great Victoria Desert to the east of Kalgoorlie. Heavier soils around Kalgoorlie prevent the two populations joining. It grows on yellow sands in mallee woodland, arid shrubland and grassland., pp. 92‚Äì93. Ecology Banksia elderiana has a woody base known as a lignotuber, from which it resprouts after fire. It has been shown to have a low to moderate susceptibility to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, unlike many Western Australian banksias. Use in horticulture Banksia elderiana is seldom cultivated, but does well in dryer climates and can adapt to cooler regions, but not humid ones. It favours a pH of 6.0 to 7.0 and a sunny aspect. Pruning helps prevent it becoming untidy with age. Its tangled growth provides good shelter and nest sites for small birds. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 31 to 42 days to germinate.

Reaching high, it is a suckering shrub that rarely reproduces by seed. The round to oval yellow flower spikes appear in spring and summer. Swiss botanist Carl Meissner described Banksia elegans in 1856. It is most closely related to the three species in the subgenus Isostylis. Description Banksia elegans grows as a many-stemmed spreading shrub to high. It commonly sends up suckers from either the roots or trunk. The trunk is up to in diameter and covered with grey tessellated bark. The new stems are covered with fine hair and become smooth with maturity. New growth mainly occurs in summer. The long thin pale blue-green leaves are long and wide. Their margins are prominently serrated in a saw-tooth pattern with triangular teeth and v-shaped sinuses. The yellow flower spikes, or inflorescences, are oval or spherical and reach in diameter. pp. 94-95. A population with particularly large inflorescences existed near Walkaway at the species' northern limit, but was on land cleared for agriculture. Each flower spike is composed of around 400 individual flowers. Over 90% of plants and 99% of flowerheads do not develop follicles and hence set no seed. Taxonomy Swiss botanist Carl Meissner described Banksia elegans in 1855, the material having been collected by James Drummond on his sixth collecting trip. He placed it in series Dryandroideae in his 1856 arrangement of the genus on account of its deeply lobed leaves. As they were defined on leaf characters alone, all of Meissner's series were highly heterogeneous. George Bentham published a thorough revision of Banksia in his landmark publication Flora Australiensis in 1870. In Bentham's arrangement, the number of recognised Banksia species was reduced from 60 to 46. Bentham defined four sections based on leaf, style and pollen-presenter characters. Banksia elegans was placed in section Orthostylis. In his 1891 work Revisio Generum Plantarum, German botanist Otto Kuntze challenged the generic name Banksia L.f., on the grounds that the name Banksia had previously been published in 1775 as Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst, referring to the genus now known as Pimelea. Kuntze proposed Sirmuellera as an alternative, republishing B. elegans as Sirmuellera elegans. The challenge failed, and Banksia L.f. was formally conserved. George was uncertain of its relationships, though noted that the follicles and seed are not unlike those of B. ilicifolia and B. cuneata, and that it clearly had a shortening of its woody axis in the flower spike. In 2002, a molecular study by Austin Mast showed B. elegans was basal to a group formed by the three members of the subgenus Isostylis, and that its next closest relative was B. attenuata In 2005, Mast, Eric Jones and Shawn Havery published the results of their cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for Banksia. They inferred a phylogeny greatly different from the accepted taxonomic arrangement, including finding Banksia to be paraphyletic with respect to Dryandra. A new taxonomic arrangement was not published at the time, but early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring Dryandra to Banksia, and publishing B. subg. Spathulatae for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons; in this way they also redefined the autonym B. subg. Banksia. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete. In the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. elegans is placed in B. subg. Banksia. Distribution and habitat Banksia elegans only occurs only over a area north and west of Eneabba, where it grows in small scattered populations consisting of fewer than 100 plants each. The populations are found between the vicinities of Mt Peron near Jurien Bay and Walkaway, on flat sandplains of less than in elevation. Stands are often found near winter-wet depressions. The surrounding vegetation is low shrubland or woodland. Associated species include Banksia attenuata, B. prionotes and B. menziesii. Ecology An ancient stump of a dead plant surrounded by regrowth from root suckers, Fraser Road, Western Australia Banksia elegans sets an extremely low amount of seed, and appears to reproduce predominantly by suckering, despite prolific flowering and low rates of flower and follicle predation. Developing seeds are also often aborted. A population studied in one field study produced an average of only two seeds per plant in sixteen years. Populations begin flowering three years after bushfire, and regenerate after fire from large underground lignotubers as well as sending up suckers. One field study found no seedlings at all post-bushfire, suggesting the shift to vegetative propagation maybe more marked than thought previously. An assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that its range is unlikely to contract and may actually grow, depending on how effectively it migrates into newly habitable areas. Conservation status This banksia is classified as \\"Priority Four\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that is rare or near threatened.

It has pinnatipartite or serrated leaves, usually rusty brown flowers, and up to twenty-five elliptical follicles in each fruiting head. It occurs along the west part of the south coast of the state. Description Banksia gardneri is a prostrate shrub that forms a lignotuber and has hairy stems that usually lie on the surface. Its leaves are pinnatipartite or serrated, long and wide on a petiole long, the lobes on the sides triangular to oblong. The flowers are borne on a head long and wide when the flowers open, with hairy involucral bracts long at the base of the head. The flowers are usually rusty brown with a cream-coloured style. The perianth is long and the pistil long. Flowering occurs from April to November and up to twenty-five densely hairy, elliptical follicles long, high and wide form in each head. Taxonomy and naming Prostrate banksia was first formally described in 1830 by Robert Brown who gave it the name Banksia prostrata, but the name was illegitimate because it was already in use (Banksia prostrata J.R.Forst. & G.Forst.) for a New Zealand endemic now known as Pimelea prostrata (J.R.Forst. & G.Forst.) Lam. In 1981, Alex George described the species in the journal Nuytsia, giving it the name Banksia gardneri.

It is one of fourteen species of banksia of the series Abietinae, all of which bear predominantly cylindrical or oval inflorescences. Collected in 1965, it was first formally described in 1981 by Alex George. Its thick leaves and large seeds distinguish it from other members of the Abietinae, and are the basis of its species name. Found in sand or sand over laterite among heath between Eneabba and Badgingarra in Western Australia, it grows as a many-stemmed shrub to high with narrow leaves and oval brownish flower spikes up to high, composed of hundreds of individual flowers. Flowering occurs throughout the cooler months of March to September. Flower spikes develop woody follicles which bear the seeds. After bushfire, Banksia grossa regenerates from its woody lignotuber; bushfires also stimulate the release of seeds, which germinate after disturbance. Visitors to (and likely pollinators of) inflorescences include insects and a nocturnal mammal, the white-tailed dunnart. Description Banksia grossa grows as a bushy shrub, generally high, or occasionally up to high. Its many stems rise from a woody lignotuber. Young stems have a coating of woolly hairs, while older stems are covered in flaky pale brown bark. Borne on 3 to 5 mm long petioles, the somewhat fleshy leaves are needle-like. Although they are between long, and only 2 to 3 mm wide, they are still thicker than those of other members of the series Abietinae. The margins of the leaves are straight with no teeth and rolled over, and the upper surfaces are sparsely hairy when young, but later hairless. New growth occurs over spring and early summer. Flowers occur in a typical Banksia flower spike: an inflorescence made up of hundreds of small individual flowers, or florets, densely packed around (and completely obscuring) a woody cylindrical axis. In B. grossa, this axis is high with a diameter of . From this, the florets radiate out laterally, giving the inflorescence a diameter of . Flowers are rusty brown to golden brown, and consist of a hairy long tubular perianth which opens at maturity (anthesis) to release the dark red to purple style. long, the style extends past the perianth and is curved at the tip. The flower spikes arise from short thick branchlets running off larger stems, though some flower spikes are terminal (located at the ends of branches and more prominently displayed in the foliage). Flowering occurs between March and September, though early flowering in December has been recorded. It takes five to eight weeks for a flower to develop from bud to the end of flowering. About three weeks before the flowers open, they develop a strong musky smell. The opening of flowers occurs sequentially, starting at the bottom of the inflorescence and sweeping through to the top over a period of around two weeks. At anthesis the flowers produce copious quantities of nectar; indeed, some flowers produce so much that it drips to the ground. After flowering, the old florets wither and curl against the spike, giving it a hairy appearance. Now known as an infructescence, it is roughly ellipsoidal, 6 to 10 cm high (2.2‚Äì4 in) and wide. Up to 25 smooth, elliptical follicles develop on the spike, each containing up to two wide wedge-shaped winged seeds. One field study revealed, on average, eight follicles for each fertile cone. Initially covered in fine fur, these are long, high and jut out by . The fur rubs off and they become smooth with wear, and generally remain closed until opened by fire. The seeds of Banksia grossa are the largest of all the species of the series Abietinae. Measuring long, they are made up of a cuneate (wedge-shaped) seed body, long by wide, and a wide wing. The woody separator is the same shape as the seed, with an impression where the seed body lies next to it. The bright green cotyledons are obovate and can be either convex or concave, measuring 1.6 to 2.2 cm long by 0.9 to 1.2 cm wide. These arise from a stocky seedling stem, known as the hypocotyl, which is reddish and covered in short hairs. The auricles of the cotyledons are 2 mm long. Seedling leaves arise 0.6 to 0.8 cm beyond the cotyledons and are oppositely arranged. Linear, they are 1.4 to 1.6 cm long with recurved margins and are covered in white hair. The stem remains reddish. Subsequent leaf pairs are successively longer. Taxonomy The first known specimen collection of B. grossa was made by botanist Fred W. Humphreys in 1965. Alex George has expressed surprise that it was not collected by earlier visitors to the area, speculating that \\"perhaps they were diverted by its similarity to B. leptophylla and B. sphaerocarpa.\\" George formally described the species in his 1981 monograph \\"The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)\\", based on a specimen collected by him on the Brand Highway, 76 km north of Regans Ford, on 14 May 1969. He placed it in subgenus Banksia because of its flower spike; section Oncostylis because its styles are hooked; and the resurrected series Abietinae, which he constrained to contain only round-fruited species. It was placed in phyletic order between B. micrantha and B. leptophylla. The specific epithet is from the Latin grossus (\\"coarse\\") and refers to the leaves, flowers and fruit, all of which George observed were more coarse than other members of B. ser. Abietinae. George's arrangement remained current until 1996, when Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published an arrangement informed by a cladistic analysis of morphological characteristics. They retained George's subgenera and many of his series, but discarded his sections. Banksia ser. Abietinae was found to be very nearly monophyletic, and so was retained. It further resolved into four subclades, so Thiele and Ladiges split it into four subseries. Banksia grossa appeared as the most basal member of the second of these: Kings Park, Perth, Western Australiaalt=a squat shrub with fine foliage around a metre high This clade became the basis for the new subseries Sphaerocarpae, which Thiele defined as containing those species with lignotubers, styles loosely curling around the infructescence (although this trait was reversed in B. micrantha), and \\"transversely aligned cells of the seed wing inner face\\". The species other than B. grossa also have shouldered follicles. Questioning the emphasis on cladistics in Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement, George published a slightly modified version of his 1981 arrangement in his 1999 treatment of Banksia for the Flora of Australia series of monographs. The placement of B. grossa was the same as in 1981, except that B. telmatiaea was moved to set between it and B. leptophylla. The placement of B. grossa in George's 1999 arrangement may be summarised as follows: alt=a branch sprouting needle-like yellow-green leaves alt=a golden ovoid bud in front of foliage and a greyish hairy ovoid flower spike behind :Banksia ::B. subg.

Isostylis (3 species) Since 1998, Austin Mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is very different from George's arrangement. Banksia grossa was inferred to be sister to a polytomous clade consisting of B. leptophylla, B. telmatiaea, B. scabrella and B. lanata: Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of Banksia by merging Dryandra into it, and publishing B. subg. Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. grossa is placed in B. subg. Spathulatae. Distribution and habitat Distribution in Western Australia Banksia grossa mainly occurs from west of Yandanooka in the north, south to Badgingarra National Park, and east almost to Coorow. It grows in shallow sand over laterite, in deep sand, and occasionally atop lateritic rises, on flat or gently undulating land, among kwongan shrubland. Around 40% of plants occur on road verges. Ecology Banksia grossa resprouts from its woody lignotuber after bushfire. Shrubs carry relatively low numbers of seeds compared with plant species that regenerate by seed after bushfire. A field study in Eneabba showed shrubs bore anywhere from 30 to 90 seeds per plant. Seeds borne on plants, however, are less likely to be eaten by animals than seed lying dormant in the soil, and hence survive to produce future seedlings. Populations of resprouting plants, like B. grossa, benefit more from longer intervals between fires as their stored seedbank takes longer to accumulate than reseeding species. The follicles generally open after bushfire, releasing seeds which germinate after disturbance. Species with persistent flowers on old spikes often require higher temperatures for follicles to open after burning; laboratory testing resulted in 50% opening after exposure to 270 ¬∞C and 90% after 400 ¬∞C. The leaves of B. grossa are adapted to a dry climate. The lower surfaces are protected by the strongly revolute shape of the leaf, the leaf margins curling around underneath almost to the mid-vein. The trichomes (leaf hairs) run along the mid-vein and the margins, further protecting the surface where the stomates are located, thus minimising water loss. Cladistic analysis suggests this species and its relatives in the series Abietinae developed long narrow leaves with inrolled margins as they invaded drier climates in Australia's southwest, having evolved from ancestors with broad leaves. The inflorescences are highly attractive to insects. The rare bee species Hylaeus globuliferus is a recorded visitor. Large numbers of ladybirds have been reported drinking the nectar of this species, while ignoring nearby Banksia attenuata inflorescences. The white-tailed dunnart (Sminthopsis granulipes) has been observed visiting flower spikes. Pollen has been found on the snouts and in the scat of several species of dasyurid marsupials, which suggests these animals are likely pollinators of Banksia species in general. No pollinators of this species were recorded in The Banksia Atlas survey. Banksia grossa is one of five closely related Banksia species that have highly unusual flower nectar. Whereas other Banksia species produce nectar that is clear and watery, the nectar of these species is pale yellow initially, but gradually becomes darker and thicker, changing to a thick, olive-green mucilage within one to two days of secretion, and eventually becoming \\"an almost black, gelatinous lump adhering to the base of the flowers\\". It was first noted by Byron Lamont in 1980; he attributed it to cyanobacteria that feed off the nectar sugars. Noting that many of these cyanobacteria had heterocysts, he speculated that they aid the plant by fixing atmospheric nitrogen, which is then washed off the flower heads by rain, and absorbed by the proteoid root mat. This purported symbiosis was investigated by Barrett and Lamont in 1985, but no evidence of nitrogen fixing was found. Further investigation by Markey and Lamont in 1996 suggested that the discolouration is not caused by cyanobacteria or other microorganisms in the nectar, but is rather \\"a chemical phenomenon of plant origin\\". Their analyses indicated that the nectar had unusually high levels of sugar and free amino acids, but three of these species, including B. sphaerocarpa, have since been shown to have normal nectar sugar compositions. The purpose of coloured nectar is unclear, especially as pollinators such as nocturnal mammals are not thought to forage by sight. However, nectar that becomes more obvious by appearance or smell as it ages might encourage pollinators to prioritise it over newer nectar. It is possible the colour change is unrelated to pollination. Use in horticulture Banksia grossa is cultivated for its attractive needle-like leaves and rusty-brown flower spikes, both of which can be quite variable in colour. This species favours well-drained sandy or loamy acidic soils with a pH of 5.5 to 7, and a sunny aspect. Once established, it tolerates dry spells. It can be pruned heavily as it resprouts from its lignotuber. Propagation is by seed. The seeds do not require any treatment before sowing, and take around 14 days to germinate. This is a slow-growing plant, taking 5 to 7 years to reach maturity and begin flowering. Cultural references This banksia was featured on an Australian postage stamp in 2018.

It is native to the southwest of Western Australia and can reach up to high and wide. This species has long narrow serrated leaves and large, bright flower spikes, initially white before opening to a bright orange that appear over the cooler months. The flowers are pollinated by honeyeaters. The ageing flower spikes develop woody seed pods known as follicles. B. hookeriana is serotinous ‚Äî large numbers of seeds are stored in the plant canopy for years until the plants are burnt by bushfire. Description Banksia hookeriana grows as an bushy shrub to around in diameter, and high. pp. 118‚Äì19. It has smooth bark. New growth appears in spring and summer. Anywhere up to several hairy -long branchlets arise from just below nodes on larger branches. The leaves themselves are scattered along the branchlets but more crowded toward the tips. They are long and wide, and slightly concave in shape. The leaf margins have 20‚Äì45 triangular lobes long each side. The v-shaped lobes are 1‚Äì3 mm high by 1‚Äì6 mm wide. The flower spikes, known as inflorescences, arise at the ends of branchlets, appearing from late April to October, with a peak over July and August. They are wide and high. Each flower spike contains around 1000 individual small flowers. The flowers remain on the ageing spikes, which go on develop up to 20 woody seed pods (follicles) each. Taxonomy Swiss botanist Carl Meissner described Banksia hookeriana in 1855, the material having been collected by James Drummond on his sixth collecting trip. The Latin specific epithet hookeriana refers to Sir Joseph D. Hooker.Sue Gordon (Editor) In his infrageneric arrangement of Banksia in 1856, Meissner placed B. hookeriana in section Eubanksia because its inflorescence is a spike rather than a domed head, and in series Salicinae, a large series that is now considered quite heterogeneous. This series was discarded in the 1870 arrangement of George Bentham; instead, B. hookeriana was placed in section Orthostylis, which Bentham defined as consisting of those Banksia species with flat leaves with serrated margins, and rigid, erect styles that \\"give the cones after the flowers have opened a different aspect\\". In 1891, German botanist Otto Kuntze challenged the generic name Banksia L.f., on the grounds that the name Banksia had previously been published in 1775 as Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst, referring to the genus now known as Pimelea. Kuntze proposed Sirmuellera as an alternative, republishing B. hookeriana as Sirmuellera hookeriana. The challenge failed, and Banksia L.f. was formally conserved in 1940. In 1981, Alex George published a revised arrangement that placed B. hookeriana in the subgenus Banksia because of its flower spike, section Banksia because its styles are straight rather than hooked, and the series Crocinae, a new series of four closely related species, all with bright orange perianths and pistils. George's arrangement remained current until 1996, when Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published an arrangement informed by a cladistic analysis of morphological characteristics. Their arrangement maintained B. prionotes in B. subg. Banksia, but discarded George's sections and his series Crocinae. Instead, B. hookeriana was placed at the end of series Banksia, in subseries Cratistylis. Questioning the emphasis on cladistics in Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement, George published a slightly modified version of his 1981 arrangement in his 1999 treatment of Banksia for the Flora of Australia series of monographs. To date, this remains the most recent comprehensive arrangement. The placement of B. hookeriana in George's 1999 arrangement may be summarised as follows: :Banksia ::B. subg. Banksia :::B. sect. Banksia ::::B. ser. Crocinae :::::B. prionotes :::::B. burdettii :::::B. hookeriana :::::B. victoriae Since 1998, American botanist Austin Mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae, which includes Banksia. With respect to B. hookeriana, Mast's results are fairly consistent with those of both George and Thiele and Ladiges. Series Crocinae appears to be monophyletic, and B. prionotes is confirmed as B. hookerianas closest relative. Overall, however, the inferred phylogeny is very different from George's arrangement. Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of Banksiinae by publishing several new names, including subgenus Spathulatae for the species of Banksia that have spoon-shaped cotyledons; in this way they also redefined the autonym B. subgenus Banksia. They have not yet published a full arrangement, but if their nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. hookeriana is placed in subgenus Banksia. It is commonly known as Hooker's banksia or acorn banksia. = Hybrids =  With Banksia prionotes  Banksia hookeriana readily hybridises with B. prionotes under experimental conditions, indicating that these species have highly compatible pollen. The cultivar B. 'Waite Orange' is believed to be such a hybrid, having arisen by open pollination during a breeding experiment conducted at the Waite Agricultural Research Institute of the University of Adelaide in 1988. Walkaway. The large size, consistent with B. prionotes, together with the narrow leaves of B. hookeriana, are diagnostic.alt= A large, dense, shrubby tree, about three metres high and wide Banksia prionotes √ó hookeriana has also been verified as occurring in the wild, but only in disturbed locations. The two parent species have overlapping ranges and are pollinated by the same honeyeater species; and though preferring different soils, they often occur near enough to each other for pollinators to move between them. It therefore appears that the only barrier to hybridisation in undisturbed areas is the different flowering seasons: B. prionotes has usually finished flowering by the end of May, whereas flowering of B. hookeriana usually does not begin until June. In disturbed areas, however, the increased runoff and reduced competition mean extra nutrients are available, and this results in larger plants with more flowers and a longer flowering season. Thus the flowering seasons overlap, and the sole barrier to interbreeding is removed. The resultant F1 hybrids are fully fertile, with seed production rates similar to that of the parent species. There is no barrier to backcrossing of hybrids with parent species, and in some populations this has resulted in hybrid swarms. This raises the possibility of the parent species gradually losing their genetic integrity, especially if the intermediate characteristics of the hybrid offer it a competitive advantage over the parent species, such as a wider habitat tolerance. Moreover, speciation might occur if the hybrid's intermediate characteristics allow it to occupy a habitat unsuited to both parents, such as an intermediate soil type. Banksia prionotes √ó hookeriana hybrids have characteristics intermediate between the two parents. For example, the first putative hybrids studied had a habit \\"like that of gigantic B. hookerana [sic]\\", having inherited the size of B. prionotes, together with B. hookerianas tendency to branch from near the base of the trunk. Similarly, the infructescences were like B. prionotes in size, but had persistent flowers like B. hookeriana. Inflorescences and leaves were intermediate in size and shape, and bark was like that of B. prionotes. Distribution and habitat It occurs on sandplain shrubland between Arrowsmith and Eneabba and specifically on the Gingin scarp and Dandaragan plateau in Western Australia, found on flat or gently sloping land. It grows on deep white or yellow sand, and tends to be the dominant species. Commonly grows with Banksia attenuata, B. elegans and Eucalyptus todtiana. Ecology Like many plants in Australia's southwest, Banksia hookeriana is adapted to an environment in which bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. Banksia hookeriana is a reseeder‚Äîkilled by bushfire and regenerating by seed. It is also serotinous, in that it holds its seeds in seed pods of old spikes in the plant canopy. As plants take 5 years to begin producing seeds and gradually accumulate more seeds over the coming decades, fire intervals around 15 to 18 years give the best chance of seedling recruitment, while intervals of less than 11 years result in reduced seedlings and ultimately possible extinction. Changing climate conditions and more frequent fire intervals have impacted on the species' reproductive rate. Plants can live up to 40 years old, though are generally killed by fire long before this. Plants growing on road verges are up to 30% taller with larger canopies and many more old flower spikes, hence storing over four times as many seeds. This is due to increased water and nutrients from runoff off the road. B. hookeriana has been shown to be highly susceptible to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, unlike many Western Australian banksias. The flowers are visited and pollinated by honeyeaters such as the white-cheeked honeyeater (Phylidonyris nigra) and brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta). Cultivation Banksia hookeriana is highly regarded in the cut flower industry, and has markets both in and outside Australia. Cut flowers have a vase life of ten days. A fast- growing plant in cultivation, B. hookeriana flowers 3‚Äì4 years from seed. It requires good drainage. It can be grown in Mediterranean climates such as Victoria and South Australia, but does not tolerate climates with summer humidity. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 23 to 49 days to germinate.

It has hairy stems, narrow linear leaves, heads of bright yellow flowers and later, up to thirty- six follicles covered with greyish hairs in each head. Description Banksia incana grows as a shrub, typically high and wide with many stems arising from a woody lignotuber. The stems are covered woolly, greyish hairs. The leaves are narrow linear, long and wide on petiole long and with a sharp point on the tip. The flowers are borne on a spherical head in diameter. The flowers are bright yellow, sometimes reddish, the perianth long and the pistil long and hooked. Flowering occurs from November to April and up to thirty-six prominent, egg-shaped follicles, long, high and wide form in each head, the old flowers having fallen. The follicles are covered with short, greyish hairs. Taxonomy Carl Meissner noted the hoary banksia as a distinct form of Banksia sphaerocarpa and in 1856 gave it the name Banksia sphaerocarpa var. glabrescens in de Candolle's Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis. Alex George raised the variety to species status in his 1981 monograph \\"The genus Banksia L.f.

She was portrayed by actress Marilyn Burns in the The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) and was later featured in a cameo appearance in Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation (1995) as a patient in a mental hospital. After a series of grave robberies, Hardesty, her paraplegic brother Franklin, and their friends travel across Texas to investigate upon hearing reports that her grandfather's grave may have been vandalized, and are forced to face Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) and his cannibalistic family. Filming was particularly challenging for Burns as she endured numerous injuries throughout the notoriously difficult shoot. In one such scene, Hansen cut her index finger with a razor due to the crew being unable to get theatrical blood to come out of the tube of a malfunctioned prop. Burns's stage clothes were so drenched with fake blood that it was solid by the last day of shooting.Jaworzyn 2004, pp. 8‚Äì33 The character has become a pop culture figure and is commonly referenced by film scholars when discussing the final girl theory; a trope that Hardesty is credited for being the catalyst of. Outside of film, Hardesty is featured in merchandise based on the films and is referenced in the 2017 video game Dead by Daylight. Appearances =The Texas Chain Saw Massacre= In The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Sally and her paraplegic brother, Franklin, travel with three friends‚ÄîJerry, Kirk, and Pam‚Äîto visit the grave of the Hardesty's grandfather after reports of grave robbing in the area. Afterwards, they decide to visit the old Hardesty family homestead. Along the way, they pick up a hitchhiker. He borrows Franklin's pocket-knife and cuts himself, then takes a Polaroid picture of the others and demands money for it. When they refuse to pay, he burns the photo and slashes Franklin's arm with a straight razor. The group forces him out of the van and drive on. They stop at a gas station to refuel, but the proprietor tells them that the pumps are empty. They continue toward the homestead, planning to return to the gas station on the way back when it has received fuel delivery. When they arrive, Kirk and Pam find a swimming-hole dried up but hear a generator running. They stumble upon a nearby house. Later, Leatherface appears and kills Franklin with a chainsaw and Sally runs to the old house. She runs upstairs and finds the desiccated bodies of an old couple. She jumps out of the second story window to escape Leatherface and runs to the gas station. The proprietor‚ÄîLeatherface's brother Drayton Sawyer‚Äîties Sally up, gags her and forces her into the back of his truck and drives to the house. Sally is tied to a chair at a dinner table and Leatherface and the hitchhiker bring the desiccated body of the old man downstairs. They decide that he should be the one who should kill her. After several failed attempts of the old man trying to hit Sally with a hammer, she manages to escape and jump through the window and flee. She reaches the road and a semi-truck stops to help her but Leatherface attacks the driver. She jumps into the back of a pickup truck that stops to help her, escaping Leatherface. She is last seen laughing and screaming hysterically as she escapes. Other Although she does not physically appear in the sequel The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986), Sally's aftermath from the first film is mentioned in the introduction. The narrator states that Sally described her traumatic encounter with Leatherface and his family as feeling like she had \\"broken out of a window in hell\\", and it is revealed that she had went into catatonia after her revealing her ordeal to the police. This film identifies her as Sally Hardesty-Enright. In the intro speech for Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III, the narrator states that Sally died in a private health care facility in 1977; this is contradicted in Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation (1995) where Sally is briefly shown being wheeled through a hospital on a gurney while still in a coma. Marilyn Burns reprised her role for this film. Sally appears in a flashback scene in the 2013 film Texas Chainsaw 3D, which serves as a direct sequel to the 1974 film. =In other media= In 2017, Fright-Rags released a T-shirt featuring a design of Sally and Leatherface. Although not playable, Hardesty is referenced in the video game Dead by Daylight. Development While studying at the University of Texas at Austin, Burns auditioned for the role of Sally when a casting call was held for The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974). Burns previously met Hooper when he was kicked off the set of Sidney Lumet's drama film Lovin' Molly (1974), in which Burns worked as a stand-in for Susan Sarandon and Blythe Danner. Burns did most of her own stunts during filming such as jumping through the window during the ending and during the dinner scene, her finger was actually cut by a real knife with no fake blood being used. Originally, the 2003 remake was intended to be told in flashback format with an aged Sally recounting her experience with Leatherface to authorities. Burns was set to reprise her role. Ultimately, this version of the film was scrapped. Reception In Shocking Cinema of the Seventies, author Xavier Mendik writes that \\"blonde Sally survives, and she's still intact. Bruised and cut, but still intact. Her hair is matted and dirty now, her tight vest is torn, her hip-hugging jeans no so white, but she's still alive. Whether this is a good thing, she does not yet know. For now, tied up, face to face with maniacs she thought she'd never see again (Hitchhiker: \\"I thought you was in a hurry?!\\"), it is all too much. Her eyes go wide before she blacks out. And then she wakes, from one nightmare into another\\". In Making and Remaking Horror in the 1970s and 2000s: Why Don‚Äôt They Do It Like They Used To?, David Roche contrasts Sally to Laurie Strode from the Halloween series stating: \\"All in all, Sally Hardesty and Laurie Strode have very little in common, apart from the fact that both characters survive the horror they have witnessed\\" and goes on to say that \\"Sally, the hippie, is very \\"feminine\\" and not especially heroic: she undergoes intense suffering, attempts to sell her body, and seems to lose her mind. Sally is, in effect, the most resisting body. As such, the character of Sally simultaneously enables the Family to attempt to assert its masculinity in the face of the abject female and contributes to the discovery of the instability of sexist patriarchal values by bearing witness to the way the Family's mimicry of patriarchy reveals its constructiveness; these two functions coalesce in the shots of Sally's eyes. I would, thus, argue that the character of Sally by no means represents a feminist development, but her resilience does enable an anti-essentialist subtext to emerge to some extent\\". However, James Rose believes that Sally and Laurie have a lot of similarities, describing: :\\"Possibly the most significant impact Hooper's film has had upon the horror genre is its sustained trauma of Sally Hardesty. The juxtaposition of her terrible plight but eventual survival seemingly reconfigured the genre and created, as Clover has termed it, the character of the Final Girl. Yet, for all her endurance, Sally is not the first Final Girl but more a survivor who stands alongside Halloween's Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis); for as much as both survive, each, in the end, requires male intervention to fully save them from the narrative's male antagonist: Sally is rescued by a passing driver, while Laurie is saved by Dr Loomis (Donald Pleasance). Despite this, both Sally and Laurie combine to make manifest the key attributes of the Final Girl as both struggled, endured and, in Laurie's case, attacked their aggressor until they could escape and be saved. In the slasher films that followed in the wake of Chain Saw and Halloween, the Final Girl steadily gains in strength until she herself vanquishes the male antagonist\\". He goes on to state the difference between the two: :\\"It is this that prevents Sally from being a true Final Girl, for she (unlike Laurie and all the others that followed) never turns upon her aggressors and attacks them. Instead, she simply endures, runs from them and, by chancem seizes an opportunity to escape. However, this is not to disagree with Clover's positioning of Sally as a Final Girl, as she does indeed endure and it is this that makes her so noteworthy\\". Editor Stefano Lo Verme compared Burns's performance as Sally to the performances of Sandra Peabody as Mari Collingwood in The Last House on the Left (1972) and Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode in Halloween (1978).

He was physician to Queen Victoria 184161. Life Forbes was born on 17 December 1787 at Cuttlebrae, near Cullen, in the parish of Rathven, Banffshire, on the Moray Firth in North-East Scotland. His elder brother Alexander is noted for having emigrated to Tepic, Mexico, and for writing the first English-language book on California history. To enlist as a surgeon in the Royal Navy, he proceeded to Edinburgh to obtain the Diploma of the College of Surgeons, passing the examination in February 1806. In 1807 he entered medical service as a temporary assistant surgeon. Apart from a short period of retraining in naval medicine and surgery at Haslar Hospital in 1811, he spent his time at sea. He was confirmed in the rank of full surgeon on 27 January 1809. After his career as a naval surgeon [1806‚Äì1816], Forbes then enrolled in the medical school at Edinburgh in 1816, aged 29 years. Dedicated to his work, his Latin dissertation was accepted within a year, proceeding to MD (Edin.) in August 1817. Dr. Forbes moved to Penzance in September 1817. Between 1817 and 1822 he laid the foundations for his knowledge of the newly invented stethoscope of Ren√© Laennec (1781‚Äì1826), about the French physician's teaching on stethoscopy: De L'Auscultation M√©diate (1819). Forbes translated this into English in four editions between 1821 and 1834. On 19 May 1820 Forbes married Eliza Mary Burgh (1787‚Äì1851) at Great Torrington, Devon. He contributed papers to the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall, of which he was secretary, and he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1829. Dr Forbes and his wife moved to Chichester in 1822, where their only child, Alexander Clark Forbes, was born in 1824. In 1836, Forbes and Dr. John Conolly started a new publication: the British and Foreign Medical Review, or, A Quarterly Journal of Practical Medicine,Holdings: British and foreign medical review, National Library of Ireland Catalogue for which they shared the editorship from 1836 to 1839. The Review was read widely in Europe and America, and helped to promote modern methods of treatment and enhancing the reputation of British medicine. On 15 October 1840, John Forbes resigned as senior physician at Chichester Infirmary and moved to London, taking up practice at 12 Old Burlington Street, Westminster. This proved to be a turning point in his career. He was assisted by schooldays friend, James Clark. Clark had been created a baronet for his services to the young Queen Victoria (1819‚Äì1901), who had been enthroned in 1837. Forbes was appointed court physician to Prince Albert (1819‚Äì1861) and the royal household on 15 February 1841. The Scottish physician had now reached the peak of his career, and further honours followed: Fellowship of the Royal College of Physicians was conferred on him in 1844 and honorary Fellowship of the Imperial Society of Physicians in Vienna in 1845. In 1852 he received the honorary degree of Doctor of Civil Law by the University of Oxford, and he was knighted by Queen Victoria in 1853. As Editor of the British & Foreign Medical Review, Forbes had written an article in his journal (1846), which was thought to be in favour of Homeopathy. This clashed with the London medical establishment and contributed to the failure of his 'Review' in 1847. A final publication 'Of Nature and Art on the Cure of Disease' based on his favourite theme of the 'vis medicatrix naturae' appeared in 1857, (second edition 1858). This emphasised that the practice of medicine should combine science with Art and set out his case for the healing powers of Nature. Sir John's book was well received both at home and abroad. After May 1860, when he resigned from the Comitia of the RCP Lond., his health declined to the point that he used a wheelchair. He retired to live at the home of his son, Alexander Clark Forbes (1824‚Äì1901) in Whitchurch-on-Thames, where he died on 13 November 1861. In his Memorandums made in Ireland in the autumn of 1852, (1853) Forbes supported religious tolerance in Ireland.  Publications  * Forbes J. (1821).

It has crowded, linear leaves with a short point on the tip, golden brown flowers with a bright yellow style and prominent egg-shaped follicles. Description Banksia laricina is a shrub that typically grows to a height of but that does not form a lignotuber. The leaves are narrow linear and crowded, long and less that wide on a petiole long, with a sharp point on the tip. The flowers are arranged in a head long with small involucral bracts at the base. The flowers are pale yellow with a yellow style, the perianth long and the pistil hooked and long. Flowering occurs from April to July and the follicles are prominent, long, high and wide, the old flowers falling from the head. Taxonomy Banksia laricina was first formally described in 1964 by West Australian botanist Charles Gardner in the Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia from specimens he collected in July 1958. The specific epithet (laricina) is derived from Latin, meaning larch-like. In 1981, George placed this species in the series Abietinae. Cladistic analysis in a 1996 paper by Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges suggested that the closest relatives of B. laricina appeared to be B. incana and B. tricuspis. In their taxonomic arrangement, Thiele and Ladiges placed B. laricina in series Abietinae, subseries Longistyles. Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement was not accepted by George, and was largely discarded by him in his 1999 arrangement in Flora of Australia. Distribution and habitat Rose banksia is restricted to a small area near the Moore River and Regans Ford where it grows in low woodland. Conservation status Banksia laricina is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. Use in horticulture Rarely cultivated, Banksia laricina will grow on sandy well drained soils in a sunny position. It may require extra water during summer dry periods and take some time (up to 18 months) to establish well. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 51 days to germinate.

It generally grows as an open woody shrub or small tree to five metres (15 ft) high, with stiff serrated leaves and unusual hanging inflorescences. Flowering occurs over summer, the greenish buds developing into oval flower spikes before turning grey and developing the characteristic large woody follicles. It occurs within and just east of the Fitzgerald River National Park on the southern coast of the state. B. lemanniana is killed by bushfire and regenerates from seed. First described by Swiss botanist Carl Meissner in 1856, B. lemanniana was named in honour of English botanist Charles Morgan Lemann. It is one of three or four related species all with pendent inflorescences, which is an unusual feature of banksias. No subspecies are recognised. B. lemanniana is classified as Not Threatened under the Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia. Unlike many Western Australian banksias, it appears to have some resistance to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, and is one of the easier Western Australian species to grow in cultivation. Description An aged grey inflorescence, showing persistent flowers Banksia lemanniana grows as an open shrub or, less commonly, a small tree to 5 m (15 ft) in height, with a spreading habit. The trunk has thin grey bark and can reach a diameter of 15 cm (6 in). Lower-growing plants that reach in height have been reported from coastal areas of Fitzgerald River National Park. The new growth is finely hairy and predominantly seen in summer, pp. 142‚Äì43. before losing its hair and becoming glabrous (smooth) over two years. The stiff leaves are narrowly wedge-shaped or more oval (cuneate to obovate) and measure 3 to 9 cm (1.2‚Äì3.6 in) in length by 1.2‚Äì3.5 cm (0.5‚Äì1.5 in) wide. The leaf margins are serrated, with many teeth measuring 0.1 to 0.3 cm each. Flowering typically occurs between October and January. Unlike those of most other banksias, the cylindrical inflorescences hang down from branchlets and measure 5‚Äì11 cm (2‚Äì4.4 in) in length and in diameter. They are green-yellow in colour and smell of honey, and drip large amounts of nectar. The buds are a rich chocolate brown in colour until the yellow flowers push through. The inflorescences turn grey as they age, and the old flowers remain as up to 20 large woody follicles develop. Oval in shape, wrinkled in texture and covered with fine hair, they can reach 4.5 cm (1.8 in) long, 3 cm (1.2 in) high, and 3 cm (1.2 in) wide. The obovate seed is long and fairly flattened, and is composed of the wedge-shaped seed body proper, measuring long and wide, and a papery wing. One side, termed the outer surface, is dark brown and wrinkled, while the other is black and smooth. Both surfaces sparkle slightly. The seeds are separated by a sturdy dark brown seed separator that is roughly the same shape as the seeds with a depression where the seed body sits adjacent to it in the follicle. Seedlings have cuneate (wedge-shaped) cotyledons which measure long and wide. These are dull green, sometimes with a reddish tinge, and the margin of the wedge may be crenulated (lined with small teeth). The hypocotyl is red and measures 1‚Äì2 cm (0.4‚Äì0.8 in) high and 0.25‚Äì0.3 cm (0.1 in) wide. Taxonomy The first known botanical collection of B. lemanniana was made by James Drummond in early 1847, during a voyage of botanical exploration through the Stirling Ranges to Cape Riche, in company with George Maxwell. This expedition would result in much of Drummond's renowned \\"Fourth Collection\\", including the celebrated Hakea victoria. On returning home, Drummond sent a report of his explorations to The Inquirer, which published it on 14 April. In it, Drummond states \\"On Mount Barren I found... a remarkable nodding yellow-flowered Banksia, with leaves and a habit so like B. Caleyii, that it can only be distinguished by the cones and flowers, which are widely different.\\" This is now recognised as a reference to B. lemanniana. The name Banksia lemanniana first appeared in print in 1852, being included in \\"A List of the Proteaceae Collected in South-Western Australia by Mr James Drummond\\", written by Carl Meissner and published in Hooker's Journal of Botany and Kew Garden Miscellany. Four years later, Meissner published a formal species description in his chapter on the Proteaceae for A. P. de Candolle's Prodromus Systematis Naturalis Regni Vegetabilis. Neither of Meissner's publications gives an etymology for the specific epithet, but it is now accepted as honouring the English botanist Charles Morgan Lemann. It has sometimes been misspelt \\"lehmanniana\\" after being mistakenly attributed to the German botanist Johann Lehmann. Common names include yellow lantern banksia and Lemann's banksia. Meissner placed B. lemanniana in series Quercinae in his 1856 arrangement of the genus on account of its strongly dentate, cuneate to obovate leaves. As they were defined on leaf characters alone, all of Meissner's series were highly heterogeneous. George Bentham published a thorough revision of Banksia in his landmark publication Flora Australiensis in 1870. In Bentham's arrangement, the number of recognised Banksia species was reduced from 60 to 46. Bentham defined four sections based on leaf, style and pollen-presenter characters. Banksia lemanniana was placed in section Orthostylis. In his 1891 work Revisio Generum Plantarum, German botanist Otto Kuntze challenged the generic name Banksia L.f., on the grounds that the name Banksia had previously been published in 1775 as Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst, referring to the genus now known as Pimelea. Kuntze proposed Sirmuellera as an alternative, republishing B. lemanniana as Sirmuellera lemanniana. The challenge failed, and Banksia L.f. was formally conserved. In his 1981 monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae), Alex George placed B. lemanniana in B. subg. Banksia because its inflorescence is a typical Banksia flower spike; in B. sect. Banksia because of its straight styles. He made it the type species of B. ser. Tetragonae, the members of which are defined by their pendulous inflorescences and tetragonal limbs. He considered it closely related to B. aculeata and B. caleyi, which are smaller, more compact, shrubs with red- or pink-tinged inflorescences. In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published the results of a cladistic analysis of morphological characters of Banksia. They retained George's subgenera and many of his series, but discarded his sections. George's B. ser. Tetragonae was found to be monophyletic, and therefore retained; and their analysis of the relationships within the series supported the placement of B. lemanniana as sister to the pair of species B. aculeata and B. caleyi. B. lemannianas placement in Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement may be summarised as follows: :Banksia ::B. subg. Isostylis (3 species) ::B. elegans (incertae sedis) ::B. subg. Banksia :::B. ser. Tetragonae ::::B. elderiana ::::B. lemanniana ::::B. caleyi ::::B. aculeata The arrangement of Thiele and Ladiges was not accepted by George, and was discarded in his 1999 revision. Under George's 1999 arrangement, B. aculeatas placement was as follows: :Banksia ::B. subg. Banksia :::B. sect. Banksia ::::B. ser. Salicinae (11 species, 7 subspecies) ::::B. ser. Grandes (2 species) ::::B. ser. Banksia (8 species) ::::B. ser. Crocinae (4 species) ::::B. ser. Prostratae (6 species, 3 varieties) ::::B. ser. Cyrtostylis (13 species) ::::B. ser. Tetragonae :::::B. lemanniana :::::B. caleyi :::::B. aculeata Since 1998, Austin Mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is rather different from previous taxonomic arrangements, but support the placement of the three species in a clade corresponding closely with B. ser. Tetragonae. Early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring Dryandra to Banksia, and publishing B. subg. Spathulatae for the species having spoon- shaped cotyledons; in this way they also redefined the autonym B. subg. Banksia. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. lemanniana is placed in B. subg. Banksia. Distribution and habitat Distribution in southern Western Australia Banksia lemanniana is found near the southern coast of Western Australia, most of its population protected within Fitzgerald River National Park. Outside the park, it reaches the Ravensthorpe Range to the northeast and the rabbit-proof fence to the east, as well as isolated populations westwards as far as Pallinup estuary. The annual rainfall is . It is found on the tops and slopes of hills as well as flatter areas on rocky or lateritic soil, as well as sand, in mallee scrubland or heath. Banksia lemanniana is relatively secure as much of its range lies within a National Park, and it is not a species collected for the cut flower industry. It is hence classified as Not Threatened under the Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia. Ecology A variety of pollinators have been recorded visiting the flower spikes, including New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), native and European honey bees, wasps and ants. The flower spikes drip nectar onto the ground or lower leaves, suggesting pollination by nonflying mammals, which are attracted to the scent. Being upside down may facilitate this process. Banksia lemanniana is killed by bushfire and regenerates from seed. It is unclear how quickly seedlings take to reach flowering in the wild, but cultivated records suggest around five or six years. If fire occurs too frequently, plants are burned before reaching maturity or before they have produced sufficient seed to ensure regeneration of the population. This may cause a population decline or even local extinction. Too long a time between fires also causes population decline, as more plants die of natural attrition without releasing their seed, resulting in seed wastage. Banksia lemanniana has been shown to have a low to moderate susceptibility to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, unlike many Western Australian banksias. A study on cultivated plants in South Australia inoculated with P. cinnamomi and P. citricola found B. lemanniana to have an overall low susceptibility overall to both organisms, although 2-to-3-week-old seedlings appeared more vulnerable than 10-month-old ones. Cultivation One of the easier Western species to grow, Banksia lemanniana has some horticultural potential in its attractive chocolate buds, green-yellow hanging flower spikes and large grey spikes with prominent follicles. It generally grows quite quickly, but nevertheless takes five to six years to flower from seed. It prefers a more alkaline rocky or sandy soil, with a nominal pH range from 6 to 7.5. It favours a sunny position and good drainage, and has been successfully cultivated in more humid climates on Australia's east coast. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 27 to 43 days to germinate.

Cherryh. It was the second of Cherryh's novels to be published, appearing after Gate of Ivrel, although she had completed and submitted Brothers of Earth first. Donald A. Wollheim, the editor of DAW Books, decided that publishing Gate of Ivrel first would be more commercially desirable, so Brothers of Earth was delayed until the former was released. The book was first published as a hardcover Science Fiction Book Club edition in June, 1976 and followed by the first DAW paperback edition in October of that year. In 2003, DAW re-released the book in an omnibus edition along with Cherryh's 1977 novel Hunter of Worlds. The omnibus edition was entitled At the Edge of Space. As with Gate of Ivrel and its sequels, Brothers of Earth is set in Cherryh's Alliance-Union universe; however, these novels describe events distant from and largely unrelated to her many subsequent works in that timeline. The book was ranked 10th on the 1977 Locus Award for Best Novel. Plot The protagonist of the book is Kurt Morgan, a crewman on the Alliance ship Endymion, which was destroyed in a space battle with Hanan forces. Morgan evacuates the ship and lands on an alien planet, home of the Nemet race. Morgan is rescued by one faction of the Nemet and becomes embroiled in their political and military struggles. Morgan is not the first human stranded on the planet, however. His encounters with a previous female human castaway endanger the entire Nemet race when she reacts badly and threatens to unleash weapons of mass destruction on the planet.

It has narrow linear leaves, heads of yellow or pale brown flowers with a yellow or purple style and later, up to eight egg-shaped follicles in each head. Description Banksia leptophylla is a much-branched shrub that typically grows to tall and wide but does not form a lignotuber. It has narrow linear leaves long and wide on a petiole long. The flowers are borne on a head long on a short side branch. The flowers are pale yellow or pale brown with a perianth long and hooked pistil long. Flowering occurs from January to December and the follicles are elliptic, in heads of eighty or more, each follicle long, high and wide. Taxonomy and naming Banksia leptophylla was first formally described in 1981 by Alex George in the journal Nuytsia. George's description was based on Carl Meisner's Banksia pinifolia, an illegitimate name because the name had already been used by Salisbury for a different species. The lectotype was an earlier specimen collected by James Drummond. The specific epithet (leptophylla) is derived from the ancient Greek words leptos, meaning \\"fine\\" or \\"slender\\" and phyllon, meaning \\"a leaf\\". In 1988, George described two varieties of this species in the journal Nuytsia and the names are accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Banksia leptophylla A.S.George var. leptophylla that flowers in summer and autumn and has a perianth long; * Banksia leptophylla var. melletica A.S.George that flowers in winter and has a shorter perianth than the autonym. Before Alex George's revision of 1981, this species was labelled informally as B. sphaerocarpa var. pinifolia or var. major. Distribution and habitat Variety leptophylla grows in shrubland and kwongan between Tathra National Park and Moora and var. melletica grows in kwongan near the coast between Kalbarri and Guilderton. Ecology Banksia leptophylla is one of five Banksia species, all closely related to B. sphaerocarpa, that have highly unusual flower nectar. Whereas other Banksia species produce nectar that is clear and watery, the nectar of these species is pale yellow initially, but gradually becomes darker and thicker, changing to a thick, olive-green mucilage within one to two days of secretion, and eventually becoming \\"an almost black, gelatinous lump adhering to the base of the flowers\\". It was first noted by Byron Lamont in 1980; he attributed it to cyanobacteria that feed off the nectar sugars. Noting that many of these cyanobacteria had heterocysts, he speculated that they aid the plant by fixing atmospheric nitrogen, which is then washed off the flower heads by rain, and absorbed by the proteoid root mat. This purported symbiosis was investigated by Barrett and Lamont in 1985, but no evidence of nitrogen fixing was found. Further investigation by Markey and Lamont in 1996 suggested that the discolouration is not caused by cyanobacteria or other microorganisms in the nectar, but is rather \\"a chemical phenomenon of plant origin\\". Their analyses indicated that the nectar had unusually high levels of sugar and free amino acids, (only abstract sighted) but three of these species, including B. leptophylla, have since been shown to have normal nectar sugar compositions. An assessment of the potential impact of climate change on B. leptophylla found that its range is unlikely to contract and may actually grow, depending on the severity of the change and how effectively the species migrates into newly habitable areas. Conservation status Both varieties of B. leptophylla are classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

It generally grows as a small shrub to 1 m (3 ft) high with long narrow serrated leaves, and bright yellow oval or round inflorescences. Flowering occurs in late summer, after which time the flower spikes age and turn to brown and then grey, and develop up to 70 follicles. It occurs in the vicinity of Kalbarri, Western Australia. Found on sandy soils, the plant serves as a pollinator for a variety of bird and animal species. Description Banksia lindleyana grows as a shrub up to tall. Young branches are densely felted with hairs, but these are lost with age, and eventually replaced with a deeply fissured grey bark. The leaves are low and narrow (4 to 13 cm long but only 0.4 to 1.2 cm wide), with serrated edges and a blunt apex; like the young branches, young leaves are felted with hairs, but these are lost with age, except in small pits on the underside. The flowering season is from January to March; flowers are yellow, and occur in a characteristic Banksia flower spike. Oval to spherical in shape, this is from 5 to 9 centimetres (2‚Äì4 in) long, and occurs on a short, lateral branchlet arising from an older branch. After flowering, the styles wither but do not fall, giving the infructescence a hairy appearance. Infructescences may contain up to 70 follicles, each with two small winged seeds. Taxonomy Commonly known as the porcupine banksia, Banksia lindleyana was first published by Carl Meissner in 1855, based on material collected by James Drummond in 1850‚Äì1851 near the lower Murchison River. Meissner did not give an etymology for the specific epithet, but it is accepted that the name honours John Lindley. Initially, Meissner's only comment on the affinities of the species was that When he published his taxonomic arrangement of Banksia the following year, in B. ser Salicinae on account of its linear leaves with grey undersides, positioning it between B. cylindrostachya and B. marginata. When George Bentham published his arrangement in 1870, he abandoned Meissner's series, which were based on leaf characters and therefore unacceptably heterogeneous. Instead he erected four sections, placing B. lindleyana in B. sect. Orthostylis (now B. ser. Banksia) because the styles, after they have been released from the perianth, are curved only at the base, and are otherwise, straight, rigid and erect. The species was positioned between B. caleyi and B. elegans. A major disruption to Banksia nomenclature occurred in 1891, when Otto Kuntze challenged Banksia L.f. on the grounds that Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst (now Pimelea) had been published before it. Kuntze transferred all Banksia taxa to the new name Sirmuellera; thus B. lindleyana became Sirmuellera lindleyana (L.f.) Kuntze. Kuntze's transfer was rejected, andSirmuellera lindleyana is now considered a nomenclatural synonym of B. lindleyana. In 1981, Alex George published \\"The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)\\", which presented the first taxonomic revision of Banksia for over a century. In George's taxonomic arrangement, B. lindleyana was placed in B. ser. Cyrtostylis, which was defined as containing those members of B. sect. Banksia with slender flowers, a small pollen- presenter, and beaked follicles. The species was placed near the middle of the series, between B. attenuata and B. ashbyi, but George also acknowledged that some characters that were not typical of the series: an unusually large pollen-presenter, and some characters similar to those of B. ser. Tetragonae. George's arrangement stood unchallenged until 1996, when Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published their revised arrangement based on a cladistic analysis of the genus. They found George's B. ser. Cyrtostylis to be highly polyphyletic, and transferred a number of taxa into other series. B. lindleyana resolved as one of the most basal species of B. subg. Banksia, after B. elegans and a small clade consisting of B. elderiana and B. ser. Tetragonae. Accordingly, it was placed alone in a new series, B. ser. Lindleyanae, which was placed between B. ser. Tetragonae and B. ser. Banksia. near the Murchison River :Banksia ::B. subg. Isostylis (3 species) ::B. elegans (incertae sedis) ::B. subg. Banksia :::B. ser. Tetragonae (4 species) :::B. ser. Lindleyanae ::::B. lindleyana :::B. ser.

Abietinae (4 subseries, 15 species, 8 varieties) Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement remained current only until 1999, when George's treatment of the genus for the Flora of Australia series of monographs was published. George's 1999 arrangement was essentially a revision of his 1981 arrangement, which took into account some of Thiele and Ladiges' data, but rejected their overall arrangement. Despite George describing B. ser. Cyrtostylis as \\"a rather heterogeneous series\\", his 1981 circumscription was restored with minimal changes, the most significant being the relocation of B. lindleyana to the end of the series, in recognition of the species' relationship with B. ser. Tetragonae: :Banksia ::B. subg. Banksia :::B. sect. Banksia ::::B. ser. Salicinae (11 species, 7 subspecies) ::::B. ser. Grandes (2 species) ::::B. ser. Banksia (8 species) ::::B. ser.

Oncostylis (4 series, 22 species, 4 subspecies, 11 varieties) ::B. subg. Isostylis (3 species) Since 1998, Austin Mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is very greatly different from George's arrangement, with B. lindleyana appearing in a clade with B. menziesii, B. ashbyi and B. sceptrum. A 2013 molecular study by Marcel Cardillo and colleagues using chloroplast DNA and combining it with earlier results reaffirmed B. lindleyana as an offshoot of a lineage that gave rise to B. ashbyi and B. sceptrum. Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of Banksia by merging Dryandra into it, and publishing B. subg. Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons; in this way they also redefined the autonym B. subg. Banksia. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. lindleyana is placed in B. subg. Banksia. Among the Dryandra species transferred into Banksia by Mast and Thiele was Dryandra lindleyana; as the specific epithet \\"lindlayana\\" was already taken, D. lindleyana was given the name Banksia dallanneyi, the new specific epithet being an anagram of \\"lindleyana\\". Distribution and habitat B. lindleyana mainly occurs in northern parts of the Geraldton Sandplains, but there is also a population well inland. B. lindleyana mostly occurs on the Geraldton Sandplains north of Geraldton toward Shark Bay, but there is also a collection from well inland, on the western edge of the Murchison region. It grows in shrubland on deep yellow sand, in the swales of coastal dunes and inland on flat sandplain. Cultivation Banksia lindleyana has horticultural appeal in its attractive flowers and flower buds, and its woody fruiting cones may be carved. It fares best in a sunny location in deep calcareous sand, and grows well in Perth soils, although not so well in cooler climates. It is a slow growing plant, and flowers in 6‚Äì8 years from seed. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 23 to 39 days to germinate.

The Noongar peoples know the plant as pungura, boongura or gwangia. It has rough, crumbly bark, linear, more or less serrated leaves arranged in whorls, yellow flowers and up to two hundred follicles in each head. Description Banksia littoralis is a tree that typically grows up to around , sometimes to , with rough, crumbly bark and woolly-hairy stems. The leaves are arranged in whorls and are linear in shape, usually serrated in the upper half, long and wide on a petiole long. The flowers are arranged on a cylindrical head long and wide when the flowers open. The flowers are yellow with a perianth long and a hooked pistil long. Flowering occurs from March to July and the follicles are broadly linear to narrow elliptical, long, high and wide, the old flowers having fallen. There are sometimes up to two hundred follicles in each head. Taxonomy and naming Banksia littoralis was first formally described by Robert Brown in Transactions of the Linnean Society of London from specimens he collected from around the shores of King George Sound, \\"especially of Princess Royal Harbour\\" in December 1801. Banksia littoralis appears most closely related to the other species of the series Spicigerae such as B. seminuda and B. occidentalis and is also quite closely related to B. verticillata a smaller shrub with much thicker leaves. Distribution and habitat Swamp banksia to coastal areas of south western Western Australia from the Wheatbelt, Peel, South West and Great Southern regions where it is often situated on along creeks and rivers, in low-lying, seasonally damp areas like swamps and depressions where it grows well in high moisture peaty to sandy soils. It is often part of low woodland communities and often is associated with Melaleuca preissiana and also in Eucalyptus gomphocephala forest communities and is rarely found as a part of low coastal kwongan communities. The range extends from around Mount Lesueur in the north to around Cape Leeuwin in the south west extending east to around Two Peoples Bay and the Stirling Range. Ecology =Response to fire= This banksia releases its seeds from the follicles as they mature and the plant responds to fire by resprouting from epicormic buds. Use in horticulture Banksia littoralis is relatively easy to grow. It is possibly not as sensitive to dieback as other western banksias. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 20 to 36 days to germinate.

It ranges from the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia to north of Armidale, New South Wales, and across Tasmania and the islands of Bass Strait. It grows in various habitats, including Eucalyptus forest, scrub, heathland and moorland. Banksia marginata varies widely in habit, ranging from a shrub to a tree. The narrow leaves are linear and the yellow inflorescences (flower spikes) occur from late summer to early winter. The flower spikes fade to brown and then grey and develop woody follicles bearing the winged seeds. Originally described by Antonio Jos√© Cavanilles in 1800, further collections of B. marginata were designated as several separate species by Robert Brown in 1810. However, all were reclassified as a single species by George Bentham in 1870. No distinct subspecies have been recognised by Banksia expert Alex George, who nonetheless concedes that further work is needed. Many species of bird, in particular honeyeaters, forage at the flower spikes, as do native and European honeybees. The response to bushfire varies. Some populations are serotinous: they are killed by fire and regenerate from large stores of seed which have been held in cones in the plant canopy and are released after a fire. Others regenerate from underground lignotubers or suckers from lateral roots. Although it has been used for timber, Banksia marginata is most commonly seen as a garden plant, with dwarf forms being commercially propagated and sold. Description Tree habit, Illabarook Rail Line Nature Conservation Reserve Banksia marginata is a highly variable species, usually ranging from a small shrub around a metre (3 ft) tall to a tree. Unusually large trees of 15 to possibly 30 m (50‚Äì100 ft) have been reported near Beeac in Victoria's Western District as well as several locations in Tasmania, while compact shrubs limited to high have been recorded on coastal heathland in Tasmania (such as at Rocky Cape National Park).Salkin, p. 145. Shrubs reach only high in Gibraltar Range National Park. The bark is pale grey and initially smooth before becoming finely tessellated with age. The new branchlets are hairy at first but lose their hairs as they mature, with new growth a pale or pinkish brown. The leaves are alternately arranged on the stems on 2‚Äì5 mm long petioles, and characteristically toothed in juvenile or younger leaves ( long). The narrow adult leaves are dull green in colour and generally linear, oblong or wedge-shaped (cuneate) and measure long and wide. The margins become entire with age, and the tip is most commonly truncate or emarginate, but can be acute or mucronate. The cellular makeup of the leaves shows evidence of lignification, and the leaves themselves are somewhat stiff. Leaves also have sunken stomates. The leaf undersurface is white with a prominent midrib covered in brownish hairs. The complex flower spikes, known as inflorescences, appear generally from late summer to early winter (February to June) in New South Wales and Victoria, although flowering occurs in late autumn and winter in the Gibraltar Range. Cylindrical in shape, they are composed of a central woody spike or axis, perpendicularly from which a large number of compact floral units arise, which measure tall and wide. Pale yellow in colour, they are composed of up to 1,000 individual flowers (784 recorded in the Gibraltar Range) and arise from nodes on branchlets that are at least three years old. Sometimes two may grow from successive nodes in the same flowering season. They can have a grey or golden tinge in late bud. As with most banksias, anthesis is acropetal; the opening of the individual buds proceeds up the flower spike from the base to the top. Over time the flower spikes fade to brown and then grey, and the old flowers generally persist on the cone. The woody follicles grow in the six months after flowering, with up to 150 developing on a single flower spike. In many populations, only a few follicles develop. Small and elliptic, they measure long, high, and wide. In coastal and floodplain populations, these usually open spontaneously and release seed, while they generally remain sealed until burnt by fire in plants from heathland and montane habitats.Salkin, p. 146. Each follicle contains one or two fertile seeds, between which lies a woody dark brown separator of similar shape to the seeds. Measuring in length, the seed is egg- to wedge- shaped (obovate to cuneate) and composed of a dark brown wide membranous \\"wing\\" and wedge- or sickle-shaped (cuneate‚Äìfalcate) seed proper which measures long by wide. The seed surface can be smooth or covered in tiny ridges, and often glistens. The resulting seedling first grows two obovate cotyledon leaves, which may remain for several months as several more leaves appear. The cotyledons of Banksia marginata, B. paludosa and B. integrifolia are very similar in appearance. Taxonomy and naming The leaf undersides are white with a prominent midrib. The downcurved margin gives the leaves a bordered appearance which is the inspiration for the species name. Banksia marginata is commonly called the silver banksia, because the white undersides of its leaves contrast with the otherwise green foliage and give the plant a \\"silvery\\" look. Alternate common names include honeysuckle and dwarf honeysuckle. The aboriginal name in the Jardwadjali language of western Victoria was , while the Kaurna name from the Adelaide Plains was pitpauwe and the local name in the Macquarie Harbour region in Tasmania was tangan. A widely distributed and diverse plant, B. marginata was described independently and given many different names by early explorers. On his third voyage, Captain James Cook reported a \\"most common tree [...] about ten feet high, branching pretty much, with narrow leaves, and a large, yellow, cylindrical flower, consisting only of a vast number of filaments; which, being shed, leave a fruit like a pine top.\\" in January 1777. The genus Banksia was named in honor of Sir Joseph Banks, a botanist who was with Captain Cook during his first voyage (1768-1771) in which he circumnavigated the world, including stops in New Zealand and Australia (Botany Bay).Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Kew Science, Plants of the World Online. Accessed 2 December 2019. The species marginata was first collected by Luis N√©e in 1793, from somewhere between Sydney and Parramatta. In 1800, the Spanish botanist Antonio Jos√© Cavanilles gave the species the binomial name it still bears today. The species name is the Latin adjective marginatus (\\"bordered\\") and refers to appearance of the lower surface of the recurved margins of the leaves when viewed from underneath. Cavanilles also described another specimen collected by N√©e in the same locality as a different species, Banksia microstachya Cav. A smaller shrub with dentate leaves, this turned out to be an immature plant of the same species with juvenile leaves.Salkin, p. 25. Robert Brown described 31 species of Banksia in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen, including six taxa (B. marginata Œ± and Œ≤ plus four further species) now attributable to B. marginata. He split the genus into two subgenera, placing these species in subgenus Banksia verae, the \\"True Banksias\\". He described Banksia australis R.Br., giving the location of the collection as Port Phillip Bay in Victoria in 1802 (having crossed out Van Diemen's Land 1804). Brown's other collections which were reduced to synonymy with B. marginata were Banksia depressa R.Br., a prostrate shrub from Margate Rivulet in southeastern Tasmania, Banksia insularis R.Br., from Flinders and King Island, and Banksia patula R.Br., a shrub from the vicinity of Port Lincoln, South Australia. The French naturalist Aim√© Bonpland in 1816 called it Banksia marcescens Bonpl., deemed an illegitimate name, as by that time the name Banksia marginata already had been published. Still more synonyms are Banksia ferrea Vent. ex Spreng. and Banksia gunnii Meisn. Plate titled Banksia marcescens in Description des plantes rares cultiv√©es √† Malmaison et √† Navarre by Aim√© Bonpland By the time Carl Meissner published his 1856 arrangement of the genus, there were 58 described Banksia species. Meissner divided Brown's Banksia verae, which had been renamed Eubanksia by Stephan Endlicher in 1847, into four series based on leaf properties. He listed six species and a further four varieties all now sunk into B. marginata in series Salicinae. In 1870, George Bentham published a thorough revision of Banksia in his landmark publication Flora Australiensis. In Bentham's arrangement, the number of recognised Banksia species was reduced from 60 to 46. Bentham observed that the characteristics Brown used to define B. australis, B. depressa, B. patula, and B. insularis were unable to distinguish separate forms as more specimens came to light, and hence declared them synonyms of B. marginata. Meissner's four series were replaced by four sections based on leaf, style and pollen- presenter characters. B. marginata was placed in section Eubanksia along with B. integrifolia and B. dentata. = Placement within Banksia = The current taxonomic arrangement of the genus Banksia is based on botanist Alex George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this arrangement, B. marginata is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, because its inflorescences take the form of Banksia's characteristic flower spikes, section Banksia because of its straight styles, and series Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. In a morphological cladistic analysis published in 1994, Kevin Thiele placed it as the most basal member of a newly described subseries Integrifoliae, within the series Salicinae. However, this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George. George did concede that major work is needed on Banksia marginata, which shows such a high degree of variability over its range. Seed separator of Banksia marginata with winged seeds still nestled against it B. marginata's placement within Banksia may be summarised as follows: :Genus Banksia ::Subgenus Isostylis ::Subgenus Banksia :::Section Oncostylis :::Section Coccinea :::Section Banksia ::::Series Grandes ::::Series Banksia ::::Series Crocinae ::::Series Prostratae ::::Series Cyrtostylis ::::Series Tetragonae ::::Series Bauerinae ::::Series Quercinae ::::Series Salicinae :::::B. dentata ‚Äì B. aquilonia ‚Äì B. integrifolia ‚Äì B. plagiocarpa ‚Äì B. oblongifolia ‚Äì B. robur ‚Äì B. conferta ‚Äì B. paludosa ‚Äì B. marginata ‚Äì B. canei ‚Äì B. saxicola Since 1998, American botanist Austin Mast and co-authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae, which then comprised genera Banksia and Dryandra. Their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from George's taxonomic arrangement. Banksia marginata resolves as the closest relative, or \\"sister\\", to B. saxicola, the two taxa part of a larger group containing B. paludosa and the three subspecies of B. integrifolia. Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele rearranged the genus Banksia by merging Dryandra into it, and published B. subg. Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons; thus B. subg. Banksia was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. marginata is placed in B. subg. Spathulatae. =Hybrids with other species= Hybridisation with Banksia conferta subsp. penicillata at the site of an old abandoned railway between Newnes and Clarence in the Blue Mountains has been recorded; a single B. marginata plant was surrounded by plants with intermediate features but more strongly resembling B. conferta subsp. penicillata. B. marginata can also interbreed with B. paludosa where they are found together. A hybrid with B. saxicola was recorded from Mount William during the Banksia Atlas project. A purported hybrid with B. integrifolia, thought to be from Cape Paterson on Victoria's south coast, was first described by Alf Salkin and is commercially available in small quantities. It forms an attractive hardy low-growing plant to . Salkin observed an intermediate form which occurred in coastal areas where Banksia marginata and B. integrifolia are found together. Calling it the Wilsons Promontory topodeme, he noted that it colonised sand dunes, had leaves similar to but narrower than integrifolia, and had persisting flowers on old spikes but not as persistent as marginata. He had collected this form from Revesby in New South Wales as well as Cape Paterson, and had received reports of similar plants at Marlo and Bemm Rivers.Salkin, p. 142. Stands of plants intermediate between B. integrifolia and B. marginata have been recorded near Mallacoota in East Gippsland. Distribution and habitat alt=a map of Australia with a green area across the a broad swathe of the southeastern corner of the continent plus Tasmania and Bass Strait Islands Banksia marginata is found from Baradine and Gibraltar Range National Park in northern New South Wales, southwards into Victoria and South Australia, as well as across Tasmania. It is found on the major islands of Bass Strait, including King, Flinders and Cape Barren Islands. There is one report of a collection from the Springbrook Mountains southwest of Southport in southeastern Queensland. It is extremely rare in southwestern New South Wales. In Victoria, it is predominantly coastal or near-coastal east of Traralgon, but in New South Wales it is absent from coastal areas in the Sydney region. Banksia marginata often grew as a large tree on the basalt plains west of Melbourne, but has almost disappeared. In the vicinity of Adelaide, it was common in the western suburbs on old sand dunes behind the beach foredunes. It remains common in the Adelaide foothills. The annual rainfall over its distribution ranges from . In the Gibraltar Range National Park, it is a dominant shrub of open heathland and a non-dominant shrub of closed heath, mostly found in swampy heath associated with sedges. Plants here have some degree of self- compatibility. In the Sydney region, it grows in association with heath banksia (Banksia ericifolia), old man banksia (B. serrata), mountain devil (Lambertia formosa), lance-leaved geebung (Persoonia lanceolata) and dwarf apple (Angophora hispida) in heathland, and with silvertop ash (Eucalyptus sieberi), Blue Mountains ash (E. oreades), Sydney peppermint (E. piperita), scribbly gum (E. haemastoma), Blue Mountains mallee ash (E. stricta), brittle gum (E. mannifera), snow gum (E. pauciflora) and red bloodwood (Corymbia gummifera) in forested areas. It is widespread as an understory species in medium rainfall eucalypt forests across Victoria, occurring in association with manna gum (Eucalyptus viminalis), narrow-leaf peppermint (E. radiata), messmate (E. obliqua), swamp gum (E. ovata) and brown stringybark (E. baxteri). It is a common shrub, sometimes small tree, in heathy and shrubby forests as well as coastal scrub and heath in part of its range. In South Gippsland, it is generally a shrub which regenerates from a lignotuber or suckers after bushfire and sets few seed. It has been recorded as a low spreading shrub in Croajingolong National Park in East Gippsland. In the Wombat State Forest west of Melbourne, it grows as a high shrub on less fertile soils, and as a large tree to on more fertile soils. Few trees remain, having been cleared for agriculture or for fuel. Similarly, further west in the Corangamite region, it is either a tree or suckering shrub. In Tasmania, Banksia marginata occupies a wide range of habitats, in mixed forest (where it grows as a small tree), button grass moorlands, flood plains of the Loddon, Franklin and Huon Rivers, as well as coastal regions.Salkin, pp. 144‚Äì45. In parts of the west and southwest of Tasmania, the species is dominant within the threatened native vegetation community known as Banksia marginata wet scrub. There is no macrofossil record for the species, so it is unclear whether it is a recent introduction from the mainland or has only recently evolved, although its presence on both the mainland and Tasmania suggests it has been present since the Pleistocene. It grows in coastal habitats that would be occupied by Banksia integrifolia on the mainland. Banksia marginata grows on a variety of soil types, from clay loams, shale and peaty loams to sandy or rocky soils composed of quartzite, sandstone, limestone or granite, although sandier soils predominate. It is restricted to sandy soils in the Adelaide region. The soil types are of a wide range of pH, from highly acidic soils in the Grampians to alkaline soils in South Australia. Plants have been recorded at altitudes ranging from sea level to as high as AHD at Mount Field National Park. Ecology Inflorescence part-way through anthesis, with the individual flowers at the base opened and those further up the spike still closed Numerous species of birds have been observed foraging and feeding at the flowers; these include rainbow lorikeet (Trichoglossus haematodus), musk lorikeet (Glossopsitta concinna), purple-crowned lorikeet (G. porphyrocephala), double-eyed fig-parrot (Cyclopsitta diophthalma), red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), little wattlebird (A. chrysoptera), yellow wattlebird (A. paradoxa), spiny-cheeked honeyeater (Acanthagenys rufogularis), yellow-faced honeyeater (Lichenostomus chrysops), singing honeyeater (Lichenostomus virescens), white-plumed honeyeater (L. penicillatus), black-chinned honeyeater (Melithreptus gularis), brown-headed honeyeater (M. brevirostris), white-naped honeyeater (M. lunatus), crescent honeyeater (Phylidonyris pyrrhoptera), New Holland honeyeater (P. novaehollandiae), tawny-crowned honeyeater (Gliciphila melanops), eastern spinebill (Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris), noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala), silvereye (Zosterops lateralis) and thornbills (Acanthiza species). In addition, the yellow-tailed black cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus funereus) feeds on the seed. The agile antechinus (Antechinus agilis), bush rat (Rattus fuscipes), feathertail glider (Acrobates pygmaeus), and sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) have been recorded visiting flower spikes. Both pollen and nectar are consumed by the southwestern pygmy possum (Cercarteus concinnus). Ants, bees (both native and European honeybees), blowflies and brown butterflies have been recorded as visitors to flower spikes. The wasp Mesostoa kerri of the subfamily Mesostoinae within the family Braconidae causes stem galls on B. marginata in southeastern South Australia. The galls are either round to a diameter of , or cigar-shaped to . Their effect on the plant is unclear. B. marginata is a host plant for the larval and adult stages of the buprestid beetle Cyrioides imperialis. Much more pathological is the banksia longicorn beetle (Paroplites australis) which bores holes in the base of banksia plants which then weaken and fall or blow over with wind and die. Several species of fungus have been recorded growing on the foliage, including Acrospermum gaubae, Argopericonia elegans, Asterina systema-solare, Botryosphaeria banksiae, a species of Cladosporium, Cooksonomyces banksiae, Dimerium banksiae, Episphaerella banksiae, a Periconiella species, Satchmopsis australiensis, Tryssglobulus aspergilloides, and a species of Veronaea. All banksias have developed proteoid or cluster roots in response to the nutrient- poor conditions of Australian soils (particularly lacking in phosphorus). The root system of the suckering forms of Banksia marginata in Victoria and South Australia have a characteristic pattern with a deep tap root, and an extensive system of thick lateral roots below the surface. During the winter months, segments around in length develop vegetative buds capable of forming suckers. Clusters of fine proteoid roots up to long arise from these lateral roots. A seedling growing in Wombat State Forest displays the serrated juvenile leaves which are larger and broader than adult ones. The response of Banksia marginata to fire is variable. In the Gibraltar Range and Sydney regions, plants are killed by fire and regenerate from seed. They are serotinous, storing their seed in old cones, forming a seedbank in their canopy which is released after bushfire. A field study found that seeds were dispersed short distances (generally or less), with those closest to the parent plant faring the best. In Little Desert National Park in northwestern Victoria and also eastern , it grows as a low shrub which suckers (grows shoots from lateral roots) after fire. Plants do not appear to live longer than 25 years; after this time the ageing plants begin to die and are succeeded by younger plants arising from suckers around the parent. A field study in Gippsland found counting the nodes of Banksia marginata plants to be accurate in indicating age within a year up to 21 years since the last fire. There is anecdotal evidence of plants reaching 150 years old in this region. Plant species from communities dependent on fire are thought to self-select to be more flammable; Banksia marginata tested from a dry sclerophyll community in southeastern Tasmania was shown to burn readily, and fire would spread easily through it. Tasmanian forms are frost tolerant at any time of year, which might explain some of their success in spreading and growing in different habitats around the island. This attribute might have allowed them to survive cold periods in Tasmania during the Pleistocene. A trial in Western Australia showed Banksia marginata to be mildly sensitive to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback. At Brisbane Ranges National Park west of Melbourne, which was invaded by Phytophthora cinnamomi in the 1970s, Banksia marginata (along with such species as Grevillea steiglitziana) was part of a secondary regrowth of understory species after more resistant shrubs such as grasses and sedges had grown back. Uses =Aboriginal Australian uses= The plant was often used by many indigenous clans and tribes throughout the east coast of Australia. The sweet nectar from the flowers was sucked or drained by soaking in water and in some cases mixed with some wattle gum to make a sweet lolly. The wood was also used to make needles and the dried flowers were used to strain the water for drinking.Ngario Plant Use in The Snowy River Catchment Page 14 =Timber= The red-hued heartwood is coarse-grained and soft. It is sometimes used for turning, but requires careful drying before use to avoid warping. A sample was prepared in Victoria in 1885 as part of a collection of local timber species under the direction of Government botanist Ferdinand von Mueller. The collection was displayed in various exhibitions, including the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889, and is housed at the Melbourne Museum. =Cultivation= Banksia marginata was first cultivated in England in 1802 (and was also listed as B. australis, B. insularis and B. marcescens). It was grown at Kew, Cambridge Botanic Gardens, Woburn Abbey and private gardens in Chelsea, Hackney and Haringay House. One specimen grown in a glasshouse at Kew was described as a tree high with a trunk girth of two feet (60 cm) at 40 years of age. B. marginata is generally fairly easy to grow in a well-drained sunny or partly-shaded position in the garden. It can be leggy in shadier positions, or a more compact bushy shrub in full sun . Some varieties from drier areas seem to do poorly in areas of summer humidity. The flowers are not prominent unless they are numerous. Established plants can withstand drought, coastal exposure and temperatures as low as . Propagation of plants can be by seed or cuttings; the latter is essential if trying to replicate plants of particular habit (such as dwarf specimens). Some Banksia marginata seed of subalpine provenance require stratification, namely keeping at for 60 days before germination takes place over 6 to 25 days. Salkin proposed this was necessary so that seed released in a summer or autumn bushfire would lie dormant over the winter months before germinating in the spring. Banksia saxicola and Banksia canei seed also share this trait. Some dwarf forms have been commercially available in Australian nurseries, although some selections do not maintain their dwarf status in cultivation. Banksia 'Mini Marg' is a small form selected from the northeastern coast of Tasmania which reaches high and wide. 'Mallacoota Dwarf' was selected from a natural population at Mallacoota, Victoria. Alf Salkin reported a form from Kanangra Walls with a peach-tinged limb as having horticultural potential, as well as a prostrate form from Cape Liptrap in Victoria. Banksia marginata, and the dwarf cultivar 'Mini Marg', have also been used in bonsai. Footnotes =References= *Salkin, Abraham Isaac (Alf) (1979). \\"Variation in Banksia in Eastern Australia\\".

An evergreen shrub, it occurs on the south coast of Western Australia between Albany and Israelite Bay, where it is a common plant. A many-branched bush with wedge-shaped serrated leaves and large golden-yellow flower spikes, known as inflorescences, it grows up to 10 metres (30 ft) high. These plants are killed by bushfire, and regenerate from seed. The flowers attract nectar- and insect- feeding birds, particularly honeyeaters, and a variety of insects. In cultivation, Banksia media grows well in a sunny location on well-drained soil in areas with dry summers. It is more resilient than most Western Australian banksias when cultivated in areas with humid summers. Description Banksia media grows as a many-stemmed shrub generally to around 4 m (13 ft) high, though specimens up to 10 m (30 ft) high and 6 m (20 ft) wide have been recorded. The trunk can reach 30 cm (12 in) in diameter. Conversely, some coastal populations such as at Point Ann have plants with a prostrate habit with the flower spikes towering above the foliage. Unlike many banksias, it does not have a lignotuber. It has grey, fissured bark, and hairy stems, putting on new growth in summer. Alternately arranged along the stems, the dark green, wedge-shaped leaves are 4 to 12 cm (1.8‚Äì4.2 in) long and 0.7 to 2 cm (0.3‚Äì0.8 in) wide with serrated margins. Leaf dimensions vary in different populations: plants from the western and coastal parts of its range have shorter and broader leaves‚Äî4 to 6 cm by 1 to 2 cm, while inland plants from around Mt Charles and Mt Ragged have longer and narrower leaves and less revolute leaf margins. Flowering takes place mainly from March to August, though occasional flower spikes may appear till December. The cylindrical spikes arise on the ends of short lateral branchlets off three- or five-year- old stems and are generally 6 to 16 cm high and 7 to 8 cm (~3 in) wide at anthesis. One population at Mt Ridley has spikes often reaching 26 cm high. Known as an inflorescence, each is a compound flowering structure, with a large number of individual flowers arising out of a central woody axis. Prostrate form with flower spikes rising above foliage, Kings Park, Perth Taxonomy Robert Brown described Banksia media in his 1830 supplement to his Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen, the type specimen having been collected between Cape Arid and Lucky Bay by collector William Baxter in 1824. George Bentham published a thorough revision of Banksia in his landmark publication Flora Australiensis in 1870. In Bentham's arrangement, the number of recognised Banksia species was reduced from 60 to 46. Bentham defined four sections based on leaf, style and pollen-presenter characters. Banksia media was placed in section Cyrtostylis. In 1891, German botanist Otto Kuntze challenged the generic name Banksia L.f., on the grounds that the name Banksia had previously been published in 1775 as Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst, referring to the genus now known as Pimelea. Kuntze proposed Sirmuellera as an alternative, republishing B. media as Sirmuellera media. The challenge failed, and Banksia L.f. was formally conserved. = Infrageneric placement = flower spike in late bud before anthesis George placed B. media in B. subg. Banksia, because its inflorescences are typical Banksia flower spikes; B. sect. Banksia because of its straight styles; and B. ser. Cyrtostylis because it has slender flowers. He considered its closest relatives to be B. praemorsa (cut-leaf banksia) and, after its discovery, B. epica. In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published the results of a cladistic analysis of morphological characters of Banksia. They retained George's subgenera and many of his series, but discarded his sections. George's B. ser. Cyrtostylis was found to be \\"widely polyphyletic\\", as six of the fourteen taxa in that series occurred singly in locations throughout Thiele and Ladiges' cladogram. The remaining eight formed a clade that further resolved into two subclades, with B. media appeared in one of them, alongside praemorsa, epica and pilostylis: Since 1998, Austin Mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is rather different from previous taxonomic arrangements. With respect to B. media, however, Mast's results accord closely with the arrangement of Thiele and Ladiges, placing it in a polytomous clade corresponding exactly with Thiele and Ladiges' B. ser. Cyrtostylis. Early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring Dryandra to Banksia, and publishing B. subg. Spathulatae for the species having spoon- shaped cotyledons; in this way they also redefined the autonym B. subg. Banksia. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. media is placed in B. subg. Banksia. Distribution and habitat Banksia media is widely distributed across southern Western Australia, from the eastern border of Stirling Range National Park across to Israelite Bay and extending northwards to Pingrup, Frank Hann National Park, 15 km east northeast of Dowak and 35 km northwest of Mt Buraminya. A disjunct population occurs further east along the coast at Point Culver and Toolinna. Often locally abundant, it grows in a variety of soil types, most commonly white sand or a sandy loam, but also red clay, loam over limestone, shale or granitic soil. The habitat is heathland, shrubland or open woodland. Ecology Banksia media is killed by bushfire and regenerates from seed. Plants in the Fitzgerald River National Park take around ten years to flower and set seed after germination, where fires are generally 30 to 60 years apart. The prominent and colourful flower spikes indicate they are attractive to vertebrate pollinators, and they are visited by a variety of species, including honey possums and a number of honeyeaters, including the New Holland honeyeater, white-cheeked honeyeater, red wattlebird and western spinebill. Insects include the meat ant and European honeybee. A field study excluding pollinators showed that the spikes can set fruit without pollinators, indicating they have a degree of self-compatibility. Cultivation Banksia media has been shown to have a relatively low susceptibility to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, unlike many Western Australian banksias. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 20 to 46 days to germinate.

He is the father of T'Challa and Shuri. He was the king of Wakanda and Black Panther before T'Challa; who inherited both titles following the death of his father, Azzuri the Wise. John Kani portrayed the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films Captain America: Civil War (2016) and Black Panther (2018) while Kani's son Atandwa portrayed a younger version of the character. Publication history T'Chaka first appeared in Fantastic Four #53 (1966) and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. Fictional character biography T'Chaka is the Chieftain of Wakanda who ascended to the throne after the death of his father King Azzuri the Wise. During 1941 at the time of World War II, Captain America traveled to Wakanda where he met T'Chaka. Together, they assisted Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos against Red Skull and Baron Strucker.Black Panther/Captain America: Flags of Our Fathers #2. Marvel Comics. T'Chaka and Captain America also faced threats from Master Man, Warrior Woman, and Armless Tiger Man when they partook in an all- out attack on Wakanda. Armless Tiger Man even threatened to kill T'Chaka if he didn't have Wakanda's forces surrender.Black Panther/Captain America: Flags of Our Fathers #3. Marvel Comics.

When he got engaged to his first wife N'Yami, T'Chaka adopted Hunter who T'Chaka groomed as the heir to the throne until the day N'Yami gave birth to T'Challa and then died from childbirth. Shortly after T'Challa's birth, his brother Jakarra was born. T'Chaka later married Ramonda who gave birth to Shuri.Black Panther Vol. 3 #30. Marvel Comics. In the fall of 1959, T'Chaka was kidnapped by Geoffrey Sydenham of the organization ICON.Avengers 1959 #1. Marvel Comics.

Ulysses Klaw and his mercenaries invaded Wakanda and demanded that T'Chaka give them their vibranium. When T'Chaka refused to give them vibranium, Klaw had his mercenaries kill T'Chaka. This angered T'Challa who used one of the mercenaries' weapons to destroy their camp and rendered Ulysses Klaw's right hand useless.Fantastic Four #53. Marvel Comics. The history of T'Chaka's death was retconned in the third volume of the Black Panther comics in which the leaders of some different countries had been unable to negotiate with T'Chaka into giving them some Vibranium. After that happened, they hired Ulysses Klaw. Upon emerging from the floor of T'Chaka's palace, Ulysses Klaw killed T'Chaka. This enraged T'Challa who wounded and drove away Ulysses Klaw. Due to the death of T'Chaka, T'Challa's uncle S'Yan ruled Wakanda in T'Chaka's place until the day when T'Challa was at the right age to be sworn in as the new Chieftain of Wakanda.

It has crowded, more or less linear leaves and in winter and spring, spikes of golden brown flowers followed by furry fruit which usually only open after fire. branchlet with terminal spike of unopened flower budsfruit with unopened follicles Description Banksia meisneri is a shrub which grow to a height of up to with a single stem at the base but much branched above. The branches are covered with woolly hair and have crowded linear to narrow elliptic leaves that are long and wide. The edges of the leaves are rolled under, the upper surface is woolly at first, becoming glabrous as it matures and the lower surface is woolly but mostly hidden by the rolled edges. The flower spikes develop mostly on side branches and are long and wide with small, hairy bracts at the base of the flowers. The flowers are golden brown with yellow styles, curved at the tip and the perianth is long and hairy on the outside. The infructescence is more or less spherical or slightly compressed vertically, long and wide, with the individual follicles high and wide. Flowering occurs from April to September and the follicles usually remain closed until after fire. Taxonomy and naming Banksia meisneri was first formally described in 1845 by Johann Georg Christian Lehmann and the description was published in Plantae Preissianae. The specific epithet (meisneri) honours the Swiss botanist, Carl Meissner. In 1981, Alex George described two varieties of B. meisneri in the journal Nuytsia: * Banksia meisneri var. ascendens A.S.George that has leaves long and more or less directed upwards; * Banksia meisneri Lehm. var. meisneri that has leaves long and spreading or directed downwards. In 1996, George raised the two varieties of B. meisneri to subspecies status and the names have been accepted at the Australian Plant Census: * Banksia meisneri subsp. ascendens (A.S.George) A.S.George; * Banksia meisneri (A.S.George) A.S.George subsp. meisneri. Distribution and habitat Meisner's banksia is found between Collie, Pingrup and Tenterden in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains and Jarrah Forest biogeographic regions of Western Australia. It grows in deep sand in shrubland and low woodland in low-lying flats. Ecology This banksia does not have a lignotuber and is killed by fire, when the follicles open and release the seeds. Conservation status Banksia meisneri is classed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, but subspecies ascendens is classified as \\"Priority Four\\" meaning that is rare or near threatened. Use in horticulture This banksia has only rarely been grown in cultivation. It is fast growing and flowers from seed after about five years. A Mediterranean climate is preferred and the species is difficult to maintain in eastern Australia. It is grown from seed which germinates after between 28 and 39 days.

It is a vehicle of the Ogdoadic Tradition, itself an important element of the Western Mystery Tradition. Ordo Aurum Solis is best known through the published works of two of its past Grand Masters, Vivian Godfrey and Leon Barcynski. Better known by their pseudonyms, Melita Denning and Osborne Phillips, the husband and wife team together authored many books (some reappearing in newer editions) that cover different aspects of magical practice, such as the Llewellyn Practical Guide to Astral Projection and Llewellyn Practical Guide to Creative Visualization, as well as their seminal work (reprinted in three volumes) outlining the philosophy and practices of Ordo Aurum Solis: The Magical Philosophy.Denning, Melita, and Osborne Phillips.

Despite a few similarities to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, some of its descendants, various Thelemic orders, and other groups stemming from the Rosicrucian revival of the 19th century, Ordo Aurum Solis represents a distinct and unique system of magical philosophy and practice based on the Ogdoadic Tradition Ogdoadic Tradition The Ogdoadic Tradition stems from the Mediterranean mystery religions of ancient Greece as well as the Theurgic practices of the priesthoods of Ptolemaic Egypt. Its signature symbol is the Eight-pointed Star of Regeneration, an emblem signifying the Regeneration of the Soul and Divine Inspiration. Its philosophy and practices appear in the works of early Hermetists and the teachings of the Neoplatonic schools of Alexandria, Apamea, and Athens in Late Antiquity. According to its initiates, the father-figure of the Tradition is Hermes Trismegistus.Tradition The symbols and philosophy of the Ogdoadic Tradition were also expressed in Byzantine art. The Ogdoadic Tradition, as mentioned in The Foundations of High Magick (The Magical Philosophy, vol. 1) by Melita Denning and Osborne Phillips, made itself evident in the frescos painted by Giotto (1270-1337) and was also incorporated into the construction of the Baptistery at Florence. Initiatory structure The initiatory structure of Ordo Aurum Solis consists of three \\"Halls\\", preceded by a special training in the Circle of the Pronaos. The three grades associated with the Halls of the Order are as follows: # Neophytos, or Apprentice of the Great Work # Servitor, or Servitor of the Secret Flame # Adeptus Minor, or Priest of the Gnosis History  =Birth of the Golden Chain= Various initiatic traditions existed in ancient Greece. These were called Mysteries. In Greece the Mysteries of Eleusis, Samothrace, Orpheus, and Dionysus were among the most important, and in ancient Rome and across its empire, the Mithraic and Isiac Traditions. These effectively combined the sacred Mysteries with the rationalism of Philosophy, which constituted the real genius of such esoteric traditions. Greek initiates were strongly present in Alexandria, in the latest period of Egyptian history known as the Ptolemaic period. They brought with them the Greek initiatic system of the Mysteries, which was then incorporated by the ancient Egyptian priests into their traditions, thereby giving a new, coherent structure to the same. According to Ordo Aurum Solis and its initiates, this was the real birth of the Hermetic Theurgic Tradition, later to be known as the Ogdoadic Tradition, or Ordo Aurum Solis. As Sumerian and Egyptian magic also found their place in the clear system of the ancient Greek Mysteries, the Western initiatic tradition was born. =Rebirth of the Order= Just before the dawn of the 20th century, there were a number of \\"antiquarian\\" and \\"folklore\\" societies in England that chronicled curiosities and pursued their own chosen researches. One such society was known as the Societas Rotae Fulgentis (i.e., ‚ÄúSociety of the Blazing Wheel‚Äù) and had been slowly amassing a wealth of knowledge and research from its various antecedents in the Ogdoadic Tradition. To this society belonged two dedicated occultists, Charles Kingold and George Stanton. In the changing religious and political environment of the late 19th century, they decided to take the core philosophy of the Societas Rotae Fulgentis and constitute it into a living magical and initiatory order, establishing Ordo Aurum Solis in 1897 and reawakening the Golden Chain of the Greek and Egyptian initiatic heritage. =Denning and Phillips= Melita Denning and Osborne Phillips are the pen-names of Vivian Godfrey and Leon Barcynski, who together authored many books in the early days of Llewellyn Publications. Chief among these was the formal presentation of the Order Aurum Solis' philosophy and praxis: The Magical Philosophy. Melita Denning, a Jungian scholar, was the first female Grand Master of the Order. She led the Order from 1976 to 1987, and from 1988 till her death on 23 March 1997. Earlier in her life, she had traveled throughout the Middle East and the Mediterranean in search of occult knowledge. It was after six years of research that she finally came upon Ordo Aurum Solis. Osborne Phillips was Grand Master of the Order from 1997 to 2003. He received magical training early in his life at the hands of Ernest Page, a London astrologer of some repute. In the early 1970s, he was in charge of psychic investigation as conducted by certain initiates of Ordo Aurum Solis.

Growing to a metre (3 ft) tall, it has pale blue-green fine leaved foliage and unusual purple-brown inflorescences which hang upside down rather than grow upright like most other banksias. It is one of many banksias first described by the botanist Robert Brown in the early 19th century. It is not commonly seen in cultivation. Readily grown in areas with Mediterranean climates, its sensitivity to dieback makes it short-lived in climates of summer humidity such as Sydney. Description It grows as a shrub up to one metre tall, without a lignotuber. Its bark peels in thin red and grey flakes. Leaves are ten to 2- centimetres long and 0.5 to 1.5 millimetres long, on a petiole two to three millimetres long. Flowers are pinkish purple in bud, purplish brown after anthesis, and smell of onion. They occur in flower spikes from four to seven centimetres long; unusually for Banksia species they are not upright but hang down. After flowering, old flowers persist on the infructescences, giving them a hairy appearance. Taxonomy =Discovery and naming= B. nutans was first collected from Lucky Bay on 1 January 1802 by Robert Brown. Brown labelled this specimen \\"Banksia nutans\\", and later collected another specimens of the same species that he labelled \\"Banksia platycarpa\\". The species was published by Brown in 1810, and has since had an unremarkable taxonomic history. Its only synonym is Sirmuellera nutans (R.Br.) Kuntze, which was published by Otto Kuntze as part of his unsuccessful attempt to transfer Banksia to the new generic name Sirmuellera. =Varieties= There are two varieties: *B. nutans var. nutans is an autonym that encompasses the type material. *B. nutans var. cernuella was published in 1981 by Alex George. It has a shorter perianth and smaller follicles than B. nutans var. nutans. The follicles are usually smooth, whereas those of B. nutans var. nutans tend to be wrinkled. =Infrageneric placement= Under Brown's taxonomic arrangement, B. nutans was placed in subgenus Banksia verae, the \\"true banksias\\", because its inflorescence is a typical banksia flower spike. Banksia verae was renamed Eubanksia by Stephan Endlicher in 1847. Carl Meissner demoted Eubanksia to sectional rank in his 1856 classification, and divided it into four series, with B. nutans placed in series Abietinae because of its entire leaves with revolute margins. When George Bentham published his 1870 arrangement in Flora Australiensis, he discarded Meissner's series, placing all the species with hooked styles together in a section that he named Oncostylis. This arrangement would stand for over a century. In 1981, Alex George published a new taxonomic arrangement of Banksia. Endlicher's Eubanksia became B. subg. Banksia, and was divided into three sections, one of which was Oncostylis. Oncostylis was further divided into four series. Meissner's B. ser. Abietinae was reinstated for one of them, and B. nutans was placed at the end of it. In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published the results of a cladistic analysis of morphological characters of Banksia. They retained George's subgenera and many of his series, but discarded his sections. B. ser. Abietinae was found to be very nearly monophyletic, and so retained. It further resolved into four subclades, so Thiele and Ladiges split it into four subseries. One subclade contained only the two varieties of B. nutans, and this clade became the basis of B. subser. Nutantes, which Thiele defined in terms of B. nutans pendent inflorescences, the fragile pellicle of the pollen-presenter, and the wrinkled follicles. The nearest outgroup of B. subser. Nutantes was the clade upon which was based B. subser. Longistyles. Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement was not accepted by George, and was largely discarded by him in his 1999 arrangement. B. ser. Abietinae was restored to George's 1981 circumscription, and all of Thiele and Ladiges' subseries were abandoned. The placement of B. nutans in George's 1999 arrangement may be summarised as follows: :Banksia ::B. subg. Banksia :::B. sect. Banksia (9 series, 50 species, 9 subspecies, 3 varieties) :::B. sect. Coccinea (1 species) :::B. sect. Oncostylis ::::B. ser. Spicigerae (7 species, 2 subspecies, 4 varieties) ::::B. ser. Tricuspidae (1 species) ::::B. ser. Dryandroideae (1 species) ::::B. ser. Abietinae :::::B. sphaerocarpa (3 varieties) :::::B. micrantha :::::B. grossa :::::B. telmatiaea :::::B. leptophylla (2 varieties) :::::B. lanata :::::B. scabrella :::::B. violacea :::::B. incana :::::B. laricina :::::B. pulchella :::::B. meisneri (2 subspecies) :::::B. nutans ::::::'B. nutans var. nutans'' ::::::'B. nutans var. cernuella'' ::B. subg. Isostylis (3 species) Since 1998, Austin Mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae, which suggest a phylogeny that is very greatly different from George's arrangement. Mast's results place B. nutans a substantial phyletic distance from the other members of B. ser. Abietinae; it nearest outgroup is a clade consisting of the members of Thiele's B. subser. Occidentales, a subseries of B. ser. Spicigerae. Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of Banksia by merging Dryandra into it, and publishing B. subg. Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. nutans is placed in B. subg. Spathulatae. Distribution and habitat Distribution of B. nutans, shown on a map of Western Australia's biogeographic regions. B. nutans grows olang the south coast of Western Australia between Albany and Cape Pasley. There are two main centres of distribution: between Albany and Hopetoun and between Scaddan and Cape Pasley. The intervening area has been largely cleared for agriculture, and B. nutans is not known to occur there. There are also some outlying populations: populations of B. nutans var. cernuella have been recorded in the vicinity of Arthur River, and the Western Australian Herbarium has recorded B. nutans var. nutans from around Norseman. The species grows in depressions, especially amongst consolidated coastal dunes, in white or grey sand, or in gravel. The majority of populations occur within the Esperance Plains biogeographic region, a region predominantly vegetated by mallee-heath and proteaceous scrub, with a warm mediterranean climate. Ecology As it lacks a lignotuber, this species is killed by fire. However, fire also triggers the release of seed from the follicles, so populations regenerate well after fire. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 17 to 54 days to germinate. A 1985-86 field study in the Fitzgerald River National Park found it to be the main summertime food source for the nectar-feeding honey possum (Tarsipes rostratus). An assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that its range is likely to contract by between 30% and 80% by 2080, depending on the severity of the change.

Found along the eastern coast of Australia from Wollongong, New South Wales in the south to Rockhampton, Queensland in the north, it generally grows in sandy soils in heath, open forest or swamp margins and wet areas. A many-stemmed shrub up to high, it has leathery serrated leaves and rusty-coloured new growth. The yellow flower spikes, known as inflorescences, most commonly appear in autumn and early winter. Up to 80 follicles, or seed pods, develop on the spikes after flowering. Banksia oblongifolia resprouts from its woody lignotuber after bushfires, and the seed pods open and release seed when burnt, the seed germinating and growing on burnt ground. Some plants grow between fires from seed shed spontaneously. Spanish botanist Antonio Jos√© Cavanilles described B. oblongifolia in 1800, though it was known as Banksia aspleniifolia in New South Wales for many years. However, the latter name, originally coined by Richard Anthony Salisbury, proved invalid, and Banksia oblongifolia has been universally adopted as the correct scientific name since 1981. Two varieties were recognised in 1987, but these have not been generally accepted. A wide array of mammals, birds, and invertebrates visit the inflorescences. Though easily grown as a garden plant, it is not commonly seen in horticulture. Description Leaf undersides showing the prominent rusty midrib, a key distinguishing feature Banksia oblongifolia is a shrub that can reach high, though is generally less than high, with several stems growing out of a woody base known as a lignotuber. The smooth bark is marked with horizontal lenticels, and is reddish-brown fading to greyish-brown with age. New leaves and branchlets are covered with a rusty fur. The leaves lose their fur and become smooth with maturity, and are alternately arranged along the stem. Measuring in length and in width, the leathery green leaves are oblong to obovate (egg-shaped) or truncate with a recessed midvein and mildly recurved margins, which are entire at the base and serrate towards the ends of the leaves. The sinuses (spaces between the teeth) are U-shaped and teeth are 1‚Äì2 mm long. The leaf underside is whitish with a reticulated vein pattern and a raised central midrib. The leaves sit on 2‚Äì5 mm long petioles. Flowering has been recorded between January and October, with a peak in autumn and early winter (April to June). The inflorescences, or flower spikes, arise from the end of 1 to 5 year old branchlets, and often have a whorl of branchlets arising from the node or base. Measuring high and wide, the yellow spikes often have blue-grey tinged limbs in bud, though occasionally pinkish, mauve or mauve-blue limbs are seen. Opening to a pale yellow after anthesis, the spikes lose their flowers with age and swell to up to high and wide, with up to 80 follicles. Covered with fine fur but becoming smooth with age, the oval- shaped follicles measure long by 0.2‚Äì0.7 cm high (0.1‚Äì0.3 in) and wide. The bare swollen spike, now known as an infructescence, is patterned with short spiky persistent bracts on its surface where follicles have not developed. Each follicle contains one or two obovate dark grey-brown to black seeds sandwiching a woody separator. Measuring long, they are made up of an oblong to semi-elliptic smooth or slightly ridged seed body, long by wide. The woody separator is the same shape as the seed, with an impression where the seed body lies next to it. Seedlings have bright obovate green cotyledons long and wide, which sit on a stalk, or 1 mm diameter finely hairy seedling stem, known as the hypocotyl, which is less than 1 cm high. The first seedling leaves to emerge are paired (oppositely arranged) and lanceolate with fine-toothed margins, measuring 2.5‚Äì3 cm long and 0.4‚Äì0.5 cm wide. Subsequent leaves are more oblanceolate, elliptic (oval-shaped) or linear. Young plants develop a lignotuber in their first year. Banksia oblongifolia can be distinguished from B. robur, which it often co-occurs with, by its smaller leaves and bare fruiting spikes. B. robur has more metallic green flower spikes, and often grows in wetter areas within the same region. B. plagiocarpa has longer leaves with more coarsely serrated margins, and its flower spikes are blue-grey in bud, and later bear wedge-shaped follicles. In the Sydney Basin, B. paludosa also bears a superficial resemblance to B. oblongifolia, but its leaves are more prominently spathulate (spoon-shaped) and tend to point up rather than down. The leaf undersides are white and lack the prominent midrib of B. oblongifolia, the new growth is bare and lacks the rusty fur, and the aged flower parts remain on the old spikes. Taxonomy First collected by Luis N√©e between March and April 1793, the fern-leaved banksia was described by Antonio Jos√© Cavanilles in 1800 as two separate species from two collections, first as Banksia oblongifolia from the vicinity of Port Jackson (Sydney), and then as Banksia salicifolia from around Botany Bay. Derived from the Latin words oblongus \\"oblong\\", and folium \\"leaf\\", the species name refers to the shape of the leaves. Richard Anthony Salisbury had published the name Banksia aspleniifolia in 1796 based on leaves of cultivated material. Robert Brown recorded 31 species of Banksia in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen, and used the epithet oblongifolia in his taxonomic arrangement, placing the taxon in the subgenus Banksia verae, the \\"True Banksias\\", because the inflorescence is a typical Banksia flower spike. He recognised B. salicifolia as the same species at this point, but was unsure whether Salisbury's B. aspleniifolia belonged under the same name. By the time Carl Meissner published his 1856 arrangement of the genus, there were 58 described Banksia species. Meissner divided Brown's Banksia verae, which had been renamed Eubanksia by Stephan Endlicher in 1847, into four series based on leaf properties. He followed Brown in using the name B. oblongifolia, and placed it in the series Salicinae. In 1870, George Bentham published a thorough revision of Banksia in his landmark publication Flora Australiensis. In Bentham's arrangement, the number of recognised Banksia species was reduced from 60 to 46. He declared B. oblongifolia referrable to, and a synonym of, B. integrifolia. Bentham defined four sections based on leaf, style and pollen- presenter characters. B. integrifolia was placed in section Eubanksia. Botanists in the 20th century recognised B. oblongifolia as a species in its own right, but disagreed on the name. Those in Queensland felt Salisbury's name was invalid and used Banksia oblongifolia, while New South Wales authorities used Banksia aspleniifolia as it was the oldest published name for the species. Botanist and banksia authority Alex George ruled that oblongifolia was the correct name in his 1981 revision of the genus. After reviewing Salisbury's original species description, which is of the leaves alone, he concluded that it does not diagnose the species to the exclusion of others and is hence not a validly published name‚Äîthe description could have applied to juvenile leaves of B. paludosa, B. integrifolia or even B. marginata. = Placement within Banksia = Old bare spike with follicles, Stanwell Tops, NSW New stems arising from the woody lignotuber after bushfire, also showing the rusty new growth Lane Cove National Park Habit, Royal National Park The current taxonomic arrangement of the genus Banksia is based on botanist Alex George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this arrangement, B. oblongifolia is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, because its inflorescences take the form of Banksia's characteristic flower spikes, section Banksia because of its straight styles, and series Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. In a morphological cladistic analysis published in 1994, Kevin Thiele placed it in the newly described subseries Acclives along with B. plagiocarpa, B. robur and B. dentata within the series Salicinae. However, this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George. B. oblongifolia's placement within Banksia may be summarised as follows: :Genus Banksia ::Subgenus Isostylis ::Subgenus Banksia :::Section Oncostylis :::Section Coccinea :::Section Banksia ::::Series Grandes ::::Series Banksia ::::Series Crocinae ::::Series Prostratae ::::Series Cyrtostylis ::::Series Tetragonae ::::Series Bauerinae ::::Series Quercinae ::::Series Salicinae :::::B. dentata ‚Äì B. aquilonia ‚Äì B. integrifolia ‚Äì B. plagiocarpa ‚Äì B. oblongifolia ‚Äì B. robur ‚Äì B. conferta ‚Äì B. paludosa ‚Äì B. marginata ‚Äì B. canei ‚Äì B. saxicola Since 1998, American botanist Austin Mast and co-authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae, which then comprised genera Banksia and Dryandra. Their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from George's taxonomic arrangement. Banksia oblongifolia resolves as the closest relative, or \\"sister\\", to B. robur, with B. plagiocarpa as next closest relative. In 2007, Mast and Thiele rearranged the genus Banksia by merging Dryandra into it, and published B. subg. Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons; thus B. subg. Banksia was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, B. oblongifolia is placed in B. subg. Spathulatae. =Variation= George noted that Banksia oblongifolia showed considerable variation in habit, and in 1987 Conran and Clifford separated the taxon into two subspecies. In examining populations in southern Queensland, they reported that the two forms were distinct in growth habit and habitat, and that they did not find any intermediate forms. New South Wales botanists Joseph Maiden and Julius Henry Camfield had collected this taller form of B. oblongifolia in Kogarah in 1898, and given it the name Banksia latifolia variety minor‚ÄîB. latifolia being a published name by which B. robur was known‚Äîbefore Maiden and Ernst Betche renamed it Banksia robur variety minor. This name (confusingly) thus became the name for the taller variety. They defined variety oblongifolia as a multistemmed shrub high, with leaves long and wide, and flower spikes high. The habitat is swamps and swamp borders, or rarely sandstone ridges. Variety minor is a taller shrub high with leaves up to long and spikes high. It is an understory plant in sclerophyll forests, associated with Eucalyptus signata and Banksia spinulosa var. collina. Both subspecies occur throughout the range. However, George rejected the varieties, stating the variability was continuous. =Hybridization= Banksia robur and B. oblongifolia hybrids have been recorded at several locations along the eastern coastline. Field workers for The Banksia Atlas recorded 20 populations between Wollongong and Pialba in central Queensland. Locales include Calga north of Sydney, Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, and Cordeaux Dam near Wollongong. A study of an area of extensive hybridization between the two near Darkes Forest on the Woronora Plateau south of Sydney revealed extensive hybridization in mixed species stands but almost none in pure stands of either species there. Genetic analysis showed generations of crossing and complex ancestry. Morphology generally correlated with genetic profile, but occasionally plants that resembled one parent had some degree of genetic hybridization. Furthermore, there were a few plants with morphology suggestive of a third species, B. paludosa, in their parentage, and requiring further investigation. A possible hybrid between B. oblongifolia and B. integrifolia was recorded near Caloundra by Banksia Atlas volunteers. Distribution and habitat Banksia oblongifolia occurs along the eastern coast of Australia from Wollongong, New South Wales in the south to Rockhampton, Queensland in the north. There are isolated populations offshore on Fraser Island, and inland at Blackdown Tableland National Park and Crows Nest in Queensland, and also inland incursions at the base of the Glasshouse Mountains in southern Queensland, at Grafton in northern New South Wales, and Bilpin and Lawson in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney.B. oblongifolia grows in a range of habitats‚Äîin damp areas with poor drainage, along the edges of swamps and flats, as well as wallum shrubland, or coastal plateaux. It is also found in open forest or woodland, where it grows on ridges or slopes, or heath. Soils are predominantly sandy or sandstone- based, though granite-based and clay-loams are sometimes present. Associated species in the Sydney region include heathland species such as heath banksia (Banksia ericifolia), coral heath (Epacris microphylla) and mountain devil (Lambertia formosa), and tick bush (Kunzea ambigua) and prickly-leaved paperbark (Melaleuca nodosa) in taller scrub, and under trees such as scribbly gum (Eucalyptus sclerophylla) and narrow-leaved apple (Angophora bakeri) in woodland. The Agnes Banks Woodland in western Sydney has been recognised by the New South Wales Government as an Endangered Ecological Community. Here B. oblongifolia is an understory plant in low open woodland, with scribbly gum, narrow-leaved apple and old man banksia (B. serrata) as canopy trees, and wallum banksia (B. aemula), variable smoke-bush (Conospermum taxifolium), wedding bush (Ricinocarpos pinifolius), showy parrot-pea (Dillwynia sericea) and nodding geebung (Persoonia nutans) as other understory species. Biology Honeybees visiting an inflorescence partway through anthesis Banksia oblongifolia plants can live for more than 60 years. They respond to bushfire by resprouting from buds located on the large woody lignotuber. Larger lignotubers have the greatest number of buds, although buds are more densely spaced on smaller lignotubers. A 1988 field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found that shoots grow longer after fire, particularly one within the previous four years, and that new buds grow within six months after a fire. These shoots are able to grow, flower and set seed two to three years after a fire. The woody infructescences also release seeds as their follicles are opened with heat, although a proportion do open spontaneously at other times. One field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found 10% opened in the absence of bushfire, and that seeds germinated, and young plants do grow. Older plants are serotinous, that is, they store large numbers of seed in an aerial seed bank in their canopy that are released after fire. Being relatively heavy, the seeds do not disperse far from the parent plant. Bird species that have been observed foraging and feeding at the flowers include the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), Lewin's honeyeater (Meliphaga lewinii), brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta), tawny-crowned honeyeater (Gliciphila melanops), yellow-faced honeyeater (Lichenostomus chrysops), white-plumed honeyeater (L. penicillatus), white-cheeked honeyeater (Phylidonyris niger), New Holland honeyeater (P. novaehollandiae), noisy friarbird (Philemon corniculatus), noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala) and eastern spinebill (Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris). Insects recorded visiting flower spikes include the European honey bee and ants. The swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor) eats new shoots that grow from lignotubers after bushfire. One field study found 30% of seeds were eaten by insects between bushfires. Insects recovered from inflorescences include the banksia boring moth (Arotrophora arcuatalis), younger instars of which eat flower and bract parts before tunneling into the woody axis of the spike as they get older and boring into follicles and eating seeds. Other seed predators include unidentified species of moth of the genera Cryptophasa and Xylorycta, as well as Scieropepla rimata, Chalarotona intabescens and Chalarotona melipnoa and an unidentified weevil species. The fungal species Asterina systema-solare, Episphaerella banksiae and Lincostromea banksiae have been recorded on the leaves. Like most other proteaceae, B. oblongifolia has proteoid roots‚Äîroots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. A study of coastal heaths on Pleistocene sand dunes around the Myall Lakes found B. oblongifolia on slopes (wet heath) and B. aemula grew on ridges (dry heath), and the two species did not overlap. Manipulation of seedlings in the same study area showed that B. oblongifolia can grow longer roots seeking water than other wet heath species and that seedlings can establish in dry heath, but it is as yet unclear why the species does not grow in dry heath as well as wet heath. Unlike similar situations with Banksia species in Western Australia, the two species did not appear to impact negatively on each other. Cultivation Conrad Loddiges and his sons wrote of Banksia oblongifolia in volume 3 of their work The Botanical Cabinet in 1818, reporting it had been brought into cultivation in 1792, though had been initially and incorrectly called Banksia dentata. It flowered in November in the United Kingdom, and was grown in a greenhouse over winter. Not commonly cultivated, it adapts readily to garden conditions and tolerates most soils in part-shade or full sun. The colours of the inflorescences in bud, and timing of flowers into winter give it horticultural value, as does its reddish new growth. Larger plants have taller flower spikes. It is propagated readily from seed, with young plants taking five to seven years to flower from seed. Pruning can improve the shrub's appearance, and it is a potential bonsai subject.

He served from January 3, 1971 to January 3, 1981, beginning in the ninety-second Congress and in four succeeding congresses. Biography McKay was born in Ogden, Weber County, Utah. He was raised as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). His brother Monroe G. McKay would become a judge of the U.S. Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in 1977, and he was a cousin of David O. McKay, the LDS Church president from 1951 to 1970. McKay served in the U.S. Coast Guard during World War II, and was later an LDS missionary in England. Afterward, he worked as a farmer, businessman and high school history teacher. Having attended the Weber County public schools, McKay studied at Weber State College in Ogden and Utah State University in Logan, graduating in education in 1962. McKay married Donna Biesinger in 1950 and they had ten children. =Politics= McKay began his political career in the Utah House of Representatives in 1962, completing two terms. He served on prominent house committees including the legislative council, Utah Long Range Goals and Planning Committee, and the Utah Government Reorganization Committee. McKay was appointed as administrative assistant to Utah Governor Cal Rampton, a fellow Democrat, between 1967 and 1970. Utahns in the state's 1st District elected McKay as a Democrat to the Ninety-second Congress in 1971, and he served in four succeeding Congresses. During his political career, McKay was a strong advocate of government development in Utah. As chairman of the Military Construction Subcommittee, McKay reopened Utah‚Äôs Minuteman Missile production line, secured the F-16 fighter mission for Hill Air Force Base, Utah, and appropriated funding to increase security at Tooele, Utah‚Äôs nerve gas storage facility. McKay also worked to ensure protection for Utah‚Äôs natural resources, securing funding that further developed Capitol Reef National Park, Glen Canyon, Arches, and Zion National Parks. He also drafted legislation on Utah‚Äôs Lone Peak Wilderness Area and on the Clean Air Act. However, as the Republican party made significant advances in western politics during the Ronald Reagan landslide, McKay lost in his bid for a 6th term to Republican James V. Hansen in 1980. He ran twice to reclaim is seat in 1986 and 1988 but was defeated both times. =Church service= An active leader in the LDS Church, McKay served as president of the Ogden Stake, between 1967 and 1970. He also served as president of the Edinburgh Scotland Mission of the LDS Church between 1981 and 1984. He and his wife later served a two-year mission to Kenya and another two-year mission to Malaysia. While in Pakistan on yet another mission, McKay returned home early due to illness. =Death= McKay died in Huntsville, Utah at the age of 75, from complications of mesothelioma. See also *Quinn G.

Description Banksia occidentalis is a shrub or small tree that typically grows to a height of and has smooth bark but does not form a lignotuber. The leaves are linear, sparsely serrated, whorled, long, wide on a petiole long. The flowers are arranged in a cylindrical spike long and wide at flowering. The flowers are gold-coloured with red styles, the perianth long and the pistil long and hooked. Flowering occurs from April to May or from August to November or January and the follicles are elliptical, long, high and wide. Up to sixty follicles form in each spike, the old flowers having fallen. Taxonomy and naming Banksia occidentalis was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown in Transactions of the Linnean Society of London. The specific epithet (occidentalis) is a Latin word meaning \\"western\\", referring to the distribution of this species relative to the related B. spinulosa. George placed this species in section Oncostylis, series Spicigerae. Distribution and habitat Red swamp banksia occurs along the south coast of Western Australia between Augusta and Cape Arid National Park where it grows in shrubland or woodland, usually on the edges of swamps but sometimes also on coastal dunes. Ecology A 1980 field study at Cheyne beach showed it to be pollinated by the New Holland honeyeater and white-cheeked honeyeater. Conservation status This banksia is listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Kulthum ibn Iyadh, an Arab aristocrat of Qaysid stock, was appointed by Umayyad Caliph Hisham in February 741 as governor of Kairouan (Ifriqiya), with authority over all the Maghreb (North Africa) and al-Andalus (Iberian Peninsula). He was to replace the disgraced Obeid Allah ibn al-Habhab, whose misgovernment had provoked the Great Berber Revolt in Morocco and led to the defeat of the Arab army at the Battle of the Nobles in late 740. Kulthum was given a fresh Arab army of 30,000, raised from the regiments () of the east - specifically, Damascus, Jordan, Qinnasrin, Emesa (Hims), Palestine and Egypt. The military command of this elite \\"Syrian\\" army was given to Kulthum's nephew and designated successor Balj ibn Bishr al-Qushayri and the vice-command to the designated second successor, Thalaba ibn Salama al-Amili. Kulthum ibn Iyadh arrived in the environs of Kairouan in the summer of 741. He did not enter the city, but dispatched a messenger assigning the government of the city to Abd al-Rahman ibn Oqba al-Ghaffari, the qadi of Ifriqiya. Kulthum then hurried along the coast to make junction with the remaining Ifriqiyan forces of Habib ibn Abi Obeida, then holding ground against the Berber rebellion around Tlemcen. The junction between the African and Syrian forces did not go smoothly. The Syrian commanders, particularly Balj ibn Bishr, treated their Ifriqiyan counterparts in high-minded and disdainful fashion, and the armies nearly came to blows. Kulthum ibn Iyadh papered over the differences and kept the armies together. The armies moved down the Sebou river into central Morocco, where they finally encountered the Berber rebel army of Khalid ibn Hamid al-Zanati. Disdaining the advice of the experienced Ifriqiyans, Kulthum ibn Iyadh made several tactical errors which led to the disastrous defeat of the Arab army at the Battle of Bagdoura in October 741. Kulthum ibn Iyadh was killed in the field. His nephew, Balj ibn Bishr al-Qushayri, managed to rescue what remained of the Syrian army and ferried them over to al-Andalus in early 742.

It is native to New South Wales, Australia, where it is found between Sydney and Batemans Bay, with an isolated population further south around Eden. There are two recognised subspecies, the nominate of which is a spreading shrub to 1.5 m (5 ft) in height, and subsp. astrolux is a taller shrub to 5 m (16 ft) high found only in Nattai National Park. Native mammals, such as the brown antechinus and sugar glider, are important pollinators of B. paludosa. Several species of honeyeaters visit the flower spikes, as do ants and the European honey bee. The response to bushfire depends on the subspecies; subspecies paludosa regenerates from underground lignotubers, while plants of subspecies astrolux are killed by fire and regenerate from large stores of seed which have been held in cones in the plant canopy. B. paludosa is sometimes seen in cultivation, with dwarf forms being registered and sold. Description The two subspecies of Banksia paludosa are identical in foliage and flower, and differ only on their size, habit, and response to bushfire. Banksia paludosa subspecies paludosa is most commonly encountered as a spreading multistemmed shrub generally under 1.5 m (5 ft) high, or rarely 2 m (7 ft). In heathland habitats such as Nadgee or Barren Grounds Nature Reserves, it may not exceed 1 m (3 ft) in height. At an exposed area such as Green Cape, it is reduced further to a 30 cm (12 in) prostrate shrub. This subspecies has a woody base, known as a lignotuber, which begins developing in the first year of life. Banksia paludosa subspecies astrolux is a more open non-lignotuberous shrub which reaches 5 m (16 ft) high. The bark and foliage is rough and covered in multiplication signs, although the new growth is covered in fine hair. The stems are generally less than 2 cm (0.8 in) in diameter, and may be red or yellow when young. The leaves are alternate or whorled along the stems, and spear- to egg-shaped (lanceolate to obovate) in shape. They measure 4‚Äì13 cm (1.6‚Äì5.2 in) long and 1‚Äì3 cm (0.4‚Äì1.2 in) wide. The leaf margins are entire or have occasional serrations. The leaf undersurface is white, with a midrib. Flowering occurs over autumn and winter (April to July) and the flower spikes, known as inflorescences, arise from stems that are three or more years old. Cylindrical in shape, they are composed of a central woody spike or axis from which a large number of compact floral units arise perpendicularly to it, and are generally 3.2‚Äì4 cm (1.3‚Äì1.8 in) wide and 7‚Äì13 cm (2.8‚Äì5.2 in) high. The individual flowers are more openly spaced than those of other banksias, and this is especially evident in late bud. This, coupled with the tall thin shape of the flower spike, makes the species quite distinctive. The flower spikes are pale- to golden brown in bud, and open to a more gold colour after anthesis. Variations are seen, one form having a grey limb in bud, and plants with particularly tall flower spikes have been recorded near Huskisson at Jervis Bay. As with most banksias, in anthesis the opening of the individual buds proceeds up the flower spike from the base to the top (acropetal). The process from bud to the finishing of flowering takes six to eight weeks.J. H. Maiden (Joseph Henry) and Margaret Flockton. As they age, the flower spikes fade to grey, with the old flowers remaining for years. Up to 60 woody follicles develop on each spike, known in this stage as an infructescence. Narrow and elliptic, they measure long, high, and wide. Some follicles open spontaneously, but most remain closed until burnt by bushfire. Each follicle contains one or two fertile seeds, between which lies a woody dark brown separator of similar shape to the seeds. Measuring in length, the seed is obovate, and composed of a dark brown wide membranous \\"wing\\" and sickle-shaped (falcate) seed proper which measures long by wide. The seed surface can be smooth or covered in tiny ridges, and often glistens. The resulting seedling first grows two asymmetrical obovate cotyledon leaves measuring long by wide, which may remain for several months as several more leaves appear. The first pairs of leaves are oppositely arranged on the stem, have 3‚Äì4 \\"teeth\\" on their margins, and are narrowly obovate in shape. They are around , and each following pair of leaves is slightly larger. The cotyledons of Banksia paludosa, B. marginata and B. integrifolia are very similar in appearance. The foliages of larger shrubs of both Banksia paludosa subspecies resemble those of Banksia conferta subsp. penicillata, but the latter has a wider inflorescence, and the buds are more crowded in appearance on the inflorescence before anthesis. Banksia paludosa also bears a superficial resemblance to B. oblongifolia, but the latter has a prominent midrib on the leaf underside, the new growth is covered in rusty fur, and the old spikes are bare of flowers. The latter grows on dryer rocky soils while the former grows in wetter sandy soils. Taxonomy Banksia paludosa was first described by Robert Brown in his 1810 On the Proteaceae of Jussieu, and named Banksia paludosa. In 1870, George Bentham demoted it to a variety of B. integrifolia (Coast Banksia), but in 1981 Alex George restored it to species rank. Its specific epithet is derived from the Latin noun palus \\"marsh\\", but is somewhat misleading, as it more often grows on sandstone ridges and heathland. Its common names, marsh banksia and swamp banksia, echo its scientific name. = Placement within Banksia = The current taxonomic arrangement of the genus Banksia is based on botanist Alex George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this arrangement, B. paludosa is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, because its inflorescences take the form of Banksia's characteristic flower spikes, section Banksia because of its straight styles, and series Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. In a morphological cladistic analysis published in 1994, Kevin Thiele placed it in the newly described subseries Integrifoliae, within the series Salicinae. However, this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George. B. paludosa's placement within Banksia may be summarised as follows: :Genus Banksia ::Subgenus Isostylis ::Subgenus Banksia :::Section Oncostylis :::Section Coccinea :::Section Banksia ::::Series Grandes ::::Series Banksia ::::Series Crocinae ::::Series Prostratae ::::Series Cyrtostylis ::::Series Tetragonae ::::Series Bauerinae ::::Series Quercinae ::::Series Salicinae :::::B. dentata ‚Äì B. aquilonia ‚Äì B. integrifolia ‚Äì B. plagiocarpa ‚Äì B. oblongifolia ‚Äì B. robur ‚Äì B. conferta ‚Äì B. paludosa ‚Äì B. marginata ‚Äì B. canei ‚Äì B. saxicola Since 1998, American botanist Austin Mast and co-authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae, which then comprised genera Banksia and Dryandra. Their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from George's taxonomic arrangement. Banksia paludosa resolves as the closest relative, or \\"sister\\", to the three subspecies of B. integrifolia. In 2007, Mast and Thiele rearranged the genus Banksia by merging Dryandra into it, and published B. subg. Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons; thus B. subg. Banksia was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, B. paludosa is placed in B. subg. Spathulatae. =Subspecies= Two subspecies are recognised. The more widespread subspecies paludosa is a lignotuberous shrub to 1.5 m (5 ft) high, while subspecies astrolux, a rare plant known only from the Starlight Trail in Nattai National Park, is a non-lignotuberous shrub which reaches 5 m (16 ft) high. The latter was first recorded by contributors Brian Walters and Kevin Mills for The Banksia Atlas mapping project in the mid-1980s. They initially thought the plants were Banksia conferta subsp. penicillata until they observed the flower spikes typical of B. paludosa. The subspecies was initially termed the Nattai River form of B. paludosa, until it was formally named by George, who coined its species name from the Ancient Greek aster \\"star\\" and Latin lux \\"light\\", a translation of the place it was found. Hybrids with Banksia marginata and B. integrifolia have been recorded at Nadgee Nature Reserve, where all three species occur. A study of an area of extensive hybridization between B. robur and B. oblongifolia at Barren Grounds Nature Reserve revealed some plants with morphology suggestive of B. paludosa in their parentage, and requiring further investigation. Distribution and habitat Distribution of Banksia paludosa. Subspecies paludosa is in green and subspecies astrolux in orange. Both subspecies of Banksia paludosa are endemic to New South Wales. The nominate subspecies paludosa is found from Glen Davis through to the Sydney region and then south to Ulladulla on the South Coast, with a separate population in the vicinity of Eden just north of the Victorian border. It occurs inland as far as Taralga on the Southern Tablelands. It was collected in 1966 from Hat Head on the Mid North Coast by Lawrie Johnson, but has not been found there since despite field work in the area. This record aside, the northernmost historical coastal record is from what is now Centennial Park and La Perouse in Sydney's eastern suburbs, where it is now locally vanished. Subspecies astrolux is restricted to Nattai National Park in the Southern Highlands. Both subspecies grow in nutrient-poor well-drained sandstone soils, in open woodland with trees such as Sydney peppermint (Eucalyptus piperita), silvertop ash (E. sieberi), grey gum (E. punctata), narrow-leaved stringybark (E. sparsifolia), red bloodwood (Corymbia gummifera) and smooth-barked apple (Angophora costata), and in heathland with species such as dwarf banksia (Banksia oblongifolia), coral heath (Epacris microphylla), and dagger hakea (Hakea teretifolia). Ecology The woody base, known as a lignotuber, of Banksia paludosa subspecies paludosa, with many stems arising, and buds, Vincentia, New South Wales Banksia paludosa subspecies paludosa is a slow-growing shrub which regenerates from bushfire by resprouting from its lignotuber. After fire, plants take around three years to flower significantly, but are flowering well by five years afterwards. Flowerhead numbers dwindle by fourteen years post bushfire. Plants are estimated to live to around 60 years of age. Seedlings also appear from seed dispersed after bushfire. All banksias have developed proteoid or cluster roots in response to the nutrient-poor conditions of Australian soils (particularly lacking in phosphorus). The flower spikes of B. paludosa are unable to self-pollinate and require pollinators to set seed. A 1988 isozyme study showed very high rates of outcrossing; pollen from one plant is well- mixed among other plants in the locale. Nonflying mammals are important pollinators in heathland habitat, with the brown antechinus (Antechinus stuartii) a frequent visitor to flower spikes. The sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) is another mammal pollinator. Bird species that have been observed foraging and feeding at the flowers include the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), yellow-faced honeyeater (Lichenostomus chrysops), white-eared honeyeater (L. leucotis), crescent honeyeater (Phylidonyris pyrrhoptera), New Holland honeyeater (P. novaehollandiae), and eastern spinebill (Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris). Insects recorded visiting flower spikes include the European honey bee and ants. Cultivation Banksia paludosa was first introduced into cultivation in England in 1805. The species was grown at Kew, Cambridge Botanic Gardens, Woburn Abbey, Loddiges nursery in Hackney, John Miller's nursery in Bristol and George Hibbert's garden at Clapham Common. It was also grown in the Villa San Donato in Italy, in the collection of Anatoly Nikolaievich Demidov, 1st Prince of San Donato. B. paludosa is cultivated in Australian gardens, and does best with a sunny aspect and good drainage, in soils with a pH from 5.5 to 7.5. Slow growing, it flowers in 6 to 10 years from seed. It can be propagated by seed, which take around two weeks to germinate, or cutting. Low growing coastal (dwarf) forms which grow to 60 cm (2 ft) are also commercially available, and should be propagated by cutting to preserve features. Noting the flower spikes to be \\"rather dull\\", plant author John Wrigley has described the species as \\"not a spectacular garden plant\\", although its foliage has been described as \\"attractive\\". A form from Jervis Bay with large orange flower spikes was deemed by amateur botanist and banksia enthusiast Alf Salkin to have horticultural potential.

Description Banksia pilostylis is a shrub that typically grows to a height of and has hard, fissured bark but does not form a lignotuber. The leaves are serrated, narrow wedge-shaped, long and wide on a petiole long. The flowers are pale yellow and closely packed in a cylindrical spike long and wide with hairy involucral bracts long at the base of the spike. The perianth is long and the pistil long and curved. Flowering occurs from October to January and up to twenty-five elliptical follicles long and wide, surrounded by the remains of the flowers, develop in each spike. The follicles usually remain closed until the plant is killed in a bushfire. Taxonomy and naming Banksia pilostylis was first formally described in 1964 by Charles Gardner in the Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia from specimens he collected in October 1960. The specific epithet (pilostylis) is from Latin and refers to the hairy style. In 1981, George placed this species in the series Cyrtostylis. Cladistic analysis in a 1996 paper by Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges confirmed that placement.

It occurs only on Hinchinbrook Island, Queensland and the immediately adjacent mainland. First collected in 1867, Banksia plagiocarpa was not described until 1981, when Alex George named it in his monograph of the genus Banksia. Genetic studies show it to be related to Banksia aquilonia, Banksia oblongifolia and Banksia robur. Description Banksia plagiocarpa grows as a shrub to high with greyish broken bark. The new growth is covered in red velvety fur, which falls off after two or three years. The long narrow lanceolate (spear-shaped) to obovate leaves are arranged alternately along the stems. Measuring long by wide, they have recurved margins lined with blunt serrations. Appearing from February to July, the flower spikes, known as inflorescences, are high and in diameter at anthesis. Arising terminally or from one- to two-year-old branches, they are often surrounded at the base by a whorl of small branchlets. Taxonomy Banksia plagiocarpa was first collected on 20 December 1867 and 21 February 1868 by John Dallachy (a collector for Victorian Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller) from Bishops Peak in the Cardwell Ranges, the specimens lodged at Kew and Melbourne Herbariums. However, it was not collected again until 28 December 1979 by Fred Hockings from Hinchinbrook Island. Both Dallachy and Hockings remarked on the unusual flower colour, the former describing it as \\"pale blue\\", the latter \\"greenish-purple\\". It was finally described in Alex George's 1981 revision of the genus. The species name is derived from the Ancient Greek words plagios \\"sloping\\" or \\"oblique\\", and carpos \\"fruit\\", and refers to the upturned wedge-shaped follicles. Common names include Dallachy's banksia and blue banksia. The current taxonomic arrangement of the genus Banksia is based on botanist Alex George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this arrangement, B. plagiocarpa is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, because its inflorescences take the form of Banksia's characteristic flower spikes, section Banksia because of its straight styles, and series Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. George held it to be most closely related to Banksia oblongifolia, which he noted often had flower spikes that were tinged blue- grey in bud, and also have affinities to the co-occurring species Banksia aquilonia In a morphological cladistic analysis published in 1994, Kevin Thiele placed it in the newly described subseries Acclives, within the series Salicinae. It appeared to be the earliest offshoot of the group, which also consisted of B. oblongifolia, B. dentata and B. robur. However, this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George. new growth on B. plagiocarpa grown at Mt. Barker, Western Australia B. plagiocarpa's placement within Banksia may be summarised as follows: :Genus Banksia ::Subgenus Isostylis ::Subgenus Banksia :::Section Oncostylis :::Section Coccinea :::Section Banksia ::::Series Grandes ::::Series Banksia ::::Series Crocinae ::::Series Prostratae ::::Series Cyrtostylis ::::Series Tetragonae ::::Series Bauerinae ::::Series Quercinae ::::Series Salicinae :::::B. dentata ‚Äì B. aquilonia ‚Äì B. integrifolia ‚Äì B. plagiocarpa ‚Äì B. oblongifolia ‚Äì B. robur ‚Äì B. conferta ‚Äì B. paludosa ‚Äì B. marginata ‚Äì B. canei ‚Äì B. saxicola Since 1998, American botanist Austin Mast and co-authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for Banksia and Dryandra. Their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from George's taxonomic arrangement, and had some similarities to Thiele and Ladiges', thus Banksia plagiocarpa grouped in a clade with B. aquilonia, B. oblongifolia and B. robur. A 2013 molecular study by Marcel Cardillo and colleagues using chloroplast DNA and combining it with earlier results reaffirmed B. plagiocarpa as an offshoot of a lineage that gave rise to B. robur, B. oblongifolia and B. aquilonia. Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele rearranged the genus Banksia by merging Dryandra into it, and published B. subg. Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons; thus B. subg. Banksia was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. plagiocarpa is placed in B. subg. Spathulatae. Distribution and habitat range of B. plagiocarpa, restricted to Hinchinbrook Island and adjacent mainland The range of Banksia plagiocarpa is limited to Hinchinbrook Island, where it is found on the top and slopes of Mount Bowen and Nina Peak, and the adjacent mainland on the Queensland north coast, where it is found on the summit and slopes of Bishops Peak. The annual rainfall is . The habitat is either open woodland or grassland, and it can be the dominant shrub. The altitude it grows at on Hinchinbrook is between , on gravelly, rocky or clay soils, and in association with such plants as tantoon (Leptospermum polygalifolium) and she-oaks (Casuarina), as well as Banksia aquilonia at lower altitudes below . On the mainland, it is found in a more sandy soil, often near water. Cultivation Banksia plagiocarpa adapts readily to cultivation, and grows well with good drainage and a sunny aspect. It has been grown successfully in cooler climates such as the Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Cranbourne. It flowers in four to five years from seed. Its horticultural features are its gunmetal grey-blue buds and red new growth. It has also been grown for the cut flower industry.

Plot introduction In the story, a ship belonging to a terrifyingly dominant space-faring race, the iduve, arrives at a space station. They demand that a particular station resident, a blue-skinned Kallian, be sent to their ship and all record of him be erased. No defiance is possible or the space station will be destroyed. The human-like Kallian is handed over to the iduve who mind-link him to a female Kallian in their service and, later, to a human prisoner, forcing him to service his captors on three levels.Cherryh, C. J. Hunter of Worlds. Reception Translator and poet Burton Raffel wrote in an essay \\"C.J. Cherryh's Fiction\\" that he was impressed that Hunter of Worlds \\"explores not only multiple-levels of species relationships, but species differences of an extraordinary nature\\". The story is told from an alien viewpoint and vocabulary, and The Routledge Companion to Science Fiction notes the emphasis in the book on language. The iduve language makes \\"no clear distinction between the concepts of noun and verb, between solid and action\\". The Encyclopedia of Fictional and Fantastic Languages describes three of the languages present in Hunter of Worlds, namely the kalliran, amaut and iduve languages, but felt that the \\"dense use of alien terminology\\" does tend to make the prose difficult to follow at times, despite the \\"Glossary of Foreign Terms\\" and the back of the book.

It occurs in a few isolated populations on the south coast of Western Australia between Albany and Cape Riche. Description Banksia praemorsa grows as a shrub to with a relatively thick sturdy trunk that branches quite close to the ground. Occasionally specimens can be up to with a trunk diameter of . The bark is rough and flaky. Flowering occurs from August to November; the flower spikes arise from the ends of small lateral branches and thus, despite being terminal, are obscured by foliage. Up to high, they are composed of hundreds of individual flowers growing out of a vertical woody spike. Taxonomy Leaves. Left: upper surface. Right: lower surface. English plantsman and botanical artist Henry Cranke Andrews described this species from a cultivated specimen in the conservatory of the Clapham Collection in July 1802. A specimen that flowered at Kew Gardens the same year was selected as the neotype by Alex George in his 1981 monograph on the genus. These plants had been raised from seed collected by Archibald Menzies at King George Sound in September‚ÄìOctober 1791. The species name is derived from the Latin adjective praemorsus \\"bitten off\\", referring to the shape of the ends of the leaves. George Bentham published a thorough revision of Banksia in his landmark publication Flora Australiensis in 1870. In Bentham's arrangement, the number of recognised Banksia species was reduced from 60 to 46. Bentham defined four sections based on leaf, style and pollen-presenter characters. He used Brown's name B. marcescens, placing it in section Orthostylis. In 1891, German botanist Otto Kuntze challenged the generic name Banksia L.f., on the grounds that the name Banksia had previously been published in 1775 as Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst, referring to the genus now known as Pimelea. Kuntze proposed Sirmuellera as an alternative, republishing B. praemorsa as Sirmuellera praemorsa. The challenge failed, and Banksia L.f. was formally conserved. =Infrageneric placement= George placed B. praemorsa in B. subg. Banksia, because its inflorescences are typical Banksia flower spikes; B. sect. Banksia because of its straight styles; and B. ser. Cyrtostylis because it has slender flowers. He considered its closest relatives to be B. media and, after its discovery, B. epica. In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published the results of a cladistic analysis of morphological characters of Banksia. They retained George's subgenera and many of his series, but discarded his sections. George's B. ser. Cyrtostylis was found to be \\"widely polyphyletic\\", as six of the fourteen taxa in that series occurred singly in locations throughout Thiele and Ladiges' cladogram. The remaining eight formed a clade that further resolved into two subclades, with B. praemorsa appeared in one of them, alongside media, epica and pilostylis: Since 1998, Austin Mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is rather different from previous taxonomic arrangements. With respect to B. praemorsa, however, Mast's results accord closely with the arrangement of Thiele and Ladiges, placing it in a polytomous clade corresponding exactly with Thiele and Ladiges' B. ser. Cyrtostylis. Early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring Dryandra to Banksia, and publishing B. subg. Spathulatae for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons; in this way they also redefined the autonym B. subg. Banksia. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. praemorsa is placed in B. subg. Banksia. Distribution and habitat All-yellow flowered form Banksia praemorsa is found in scattered colonies along the south coast of Western Australia between Torbay (near Albany) and Cape Riche, where it occurs on the sea-facing side of sand dunes or sand cliffs or hills over limestone; all populations occur within 2 km (1.2 mi) of the coast. The annual rainfall is 800 mm (31.5 in). Cultivation Banksia praemorsa adapts readily to cultivation, though does not tolerate summer humidity well. It takes 4‚Äì5 years to flower from seed. The all-yellow flowered form is often cultivated, and has reached 9 m (30 ft) high at the Banksia Farm in Mount Barker, WA. It tolerates soil pH of 5.5 to 7.5, and requires good drainage and a sunny aspect. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 30 to 49 days to germinate.

Taxonomy Specimens of B. repens were first collected by Jacques Labillardi√®re from the vicinity of present day Esperance, Western Australia on 16 December 1792. Labillardi√®re was botanist to an expedition under Bruni d'Entrecasteaux, which anchored in Esperance Bay on 9 December. On 14 December, the zoologist Claude Riche went ashore, and failed to return. A search the following day proved unsuccessful. Several senior members of the expedition were convinced that Riche must have perished of thirst or at the hands of the Australian Aborigines, and counselled d'Entrecasteaux to sail without him. However Labillardi√®re convinced d'Entrecasteaux to search for another day, and was rewarded not only with the recovery of Riche, but also with the collection of several highly significant botanical specimens, including the first specimens of Anigozanthos (Kangaroo Paw), Nuytsia floribunda (West Australian Christmas Tree), Banksia nivea (Honeypot Dryandra) and B. repens. Labillardi√®re published a formal description of B. repens in his 1800 Relation du Voyage √† la Recherche de la P√©rouse; this was accompanied by an illustration by Pierre-Joseph Redout√©.

It occurs in Victoria in two distinct populations, one in The Grampians and the other on Wilsons Promontory. Formerly considered to be a form of B. integrifolia, it was described as a distinct species by Alex George in 1981. It is most closely related to Banksia marginata. Near the coast, B. saxicola grows as a tree to high, while in alpine areas it is a shrub that grows up to high, or in exposed areas. It has leathery green leaves and grey-yellow inflorescences (flower spikes) which appear in summer and early autumn. The old flowers fall off the spikes, followed by the development of finely furred follicles. Description Banksia saxicola grows as a tall upright tree to high at Wilsons Promontory, or as a sprawling shrub in the Grampians. At the latter location, plants maintain their spreading habit even in more sheltered parts, reaching around high there but restricted to high in more exposed areas. New growth appears in summer. The 2‚Äì4 mm thick bark is brown on younger plants and grey‚Äîand often covered with lichen‚Äîon older plants. The leathery dark green leaves are roughly oval and measure long by wide. They are arranged in whorls along the stems on 5‚Äì10 mm long petioles. The flowering period is from January to March, with some occasional late flowers in May. The cylindrical flower spikes, known as inflorescences, arising from two- to six-year-old branches. They are high and wide at anthesis. Flower parts fall off the ageing spikes, leaving them bare. They swell and develop 20 to 60 follicles that are covered in fine fur and open only when burnt in fire.

The northernmost populations are on the margins of Mt Difficult Plateau, 9 km southeast of Wartook. It is found at altitudes above 600 m (2000 ft). It is found in taller forest at altitudes of at Wilsons Promontory. Ecology Banksia saxicola plants are killed by bushfire and regenerate from seed. Plants flower four to five years after germinating. Banksia flower spikes are important sources of nectar for mammals, insects and birds, particularly honeyeaters. Birds observed visiting flower spikes of B. saxicola include the New Holland honeyeater and crescent honeyeater. Cultivation Banksia saxicola adapts readily to cultivation, particularly in cooler climates, and has been grown outside in the United Kingdom, Tasmania and at Lees in the Netherlands. Its attractive foliage and furry follicles (which can look as if snowed on) are its horticultural features. It flowers in 3 to 4 years from seed.

It is classified in the series Abietinae, a group of several species of shrubs with small round or oval inflorescences. It occurs in a number of isolated populations south of Geraldton, Western Australia, with the largest population being south and east of Mount Adams. Found on sandy soils in heathland or shrubland, it grows to high and across with fine needle-like leaves. Appearing in spring and summer, the inflorescences are round to oval in shape and tan to cream with purple styles. Banksia scabrella is killed by fire and regenerates by seed. Originally collected in 1966, B. scabrella was one of several species previously considered to be forms of Banksia sphaerocarpa, before it was finally described by banksia expert Alex George in his 1981 revision of the genus. Like many members of the Abietinae, it is rarely seen in cultivation; however, it has been described as having horticultural potential. Description Banksia scabrella grows as a low shrub to 2 m (7 ft) in height and 3 m (10 ft) across, with a spreading habit. Its lateral branches are low and often rest on the ground. The small linear leaves measure 0.8 to 2.8 cm in length and 0.1 cm in width and are crowded along the stems. George recorded flowering as occurring in spring and summer (September to January), but The Banksia Atlas recorded the species in bloom in April. Flowers occur in \\"flower spikes\\", or inflorescences, made up of hundreds of small flowers, or florets, densely packed around a woody axis. Quite conspicuous, they are terminal (occurring on the ends of branches) or on short side branchlets. Round or oval in shape, the cream or tan inflorescences are 3 to 6 cm (1.2‚Äì2.4 in) high and 7‚Äì9 cm (2.8‚Äì3.6 in) wide. The individual flowers are light yellow or cream, with the styles and upper floral parts purple. The perianths measure 2.7 to 3.5 cm (1‚Äì1.6 in), while the pistils 3.4 to 4.5 cm (1.6‚Äì1.8 in) in length and are curved at the apex. The inflorescences fade to grey as they age and the old flowers do not fall off. Up to 80 follicles develop on one spike, and remain closed until opened after a bushfire. Oval-shaped, they measure 1.8‚Äì2.8 cm (0.7‚Äì1.1 in) in length, by 0.5‚Äì0.9 cm (0.2‚Äì0.4 in) high, and 0.6‚Äì0.8 cm (0.2‚Äì0.3 in) wide. They open to release a dark brown oval seed 1.3‚Äì1.5 cm (0.5‚Äì0.6 in) long, 0.4‚Äì0.5 cm (0.2 in) wide with a papery dark 'wing' 1.4‚Äì2.4 cm (0.6‚Äì1 in) wide. Seedlings have narrowly obovate bright green cotyledons 1.2‚Äì1.4 cm (0.5‚Äì0.6 in) long by 0.3‚Äì0.4 cm (0.1‚Äì0.2 in) wide, and the leaves which develop immediately afterward are linear and scattered, and the stem is hairy. Taxonomy Habit, near alt=An untidy-looking shrub around 1.5 m high in shrublandFirst collected on 4 September 1966, southeast of Walkaway, Banksia scabrella was described by Alex George in his 1981 revision of the genus Banksia. He gave it the epithet scabrella, a diminutive of the Latin adjective scaber \\"rough\\", referring to the leaves. George placed B. scabrella in subgenus Banksia because of its flower spike, section Oncostylis because its styles are hooked, and the resurrected series Abietinae, which he constrained to contain only round-fruited species. He initially thought its closest relative to be Banksia leptophylla, which is found in the same region, and later felt it to be B. lanata, which has similarly coloured inflorescences but longer smooth leaves. It was one of several new species previously regarded as a form of Banksia sphaerocarpa. In 1996, botanists Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published an arrangement informed by a cladistic analysis of morphological characteristics. They retained George's subgenera and many of his series, but discarded his sections. Banksia ser. Abietinae was found to be very nearly monophyletic, and so retained. It further resolved into four subclades, so Thiele and Ladiges split it into four subseries. Banksia scabrella appeared in the third of these, initially called the \\"telmatiaea clade\\" for its most basal member. As with George's classification, B. lanata and two subspecies of B. leptophylla emerged as close relatives of B. scabrella, but there was some question over the relationships between all five forms in the clade. This clade became the basis for a new subseries Leptophyllae, which Thiele defined as containing species with \\"indurated and spinescent common bracts on the infructescence axes\\", and seedling stems which were densely arachnose (covered in fine hair). Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement was not accepted by George, and was largely discarded by him in his 1999 arrangement. B. ser. Abietinae was restored to George's 1981 circumscription, and all of Thiele and Ladiges' subseries were abandoned. The placement of B. scabrella in George's 1999 arrangement may be summarised as follows: alt=A pale green cylindrical bud in orange sand. Horizontal branches are nearby. :Banksia ::B. subg. Banksia :::B. sect. Banksia (9 series, 50 species, 9 subspecies, 3 varieties) :::B. sect. Coccinea (1 species) :::B. sect. Oncostylis ::::B. ser.

Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of Banksia by merging Dryandra into it, and publishing B. subg. Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. scabrella is placed in B. subg. Spathulatae. Distribution and habitat Mount Adams.alt=Map of Western Australia with two small green patches midway along the west coast Banksia scabrella is found in two disjunct areas of scattered populations; the first discovered being southeast of the small town of Walkaway south of Geraldton, while a more populous cluster is found southeast of Mount Adams in Western Australia. The average annual rainfall over its range is around 450 mm (18 in). It has been placed on the Declared Rare and Priority Flora List, where it is classified as a \\"Priority Four ‚Äì Rare\\" taxon; although it is rare, it is not currently threatened by any identifiable factors. These taxa require monitoring every 5 to 10 years. Many stands are populous, and number over 100 plants. However, over half the known population of B. scabrella is found on road verges. Found in deep pale yellow or white sand in kwongan scrubland and heathland, B. scabrella grows on flat areas or gentle slopes and is found in association with B. leptophylla and a dwarf form of B. attenuata. Ecology Most Proteaceae and all Banksia species, including B. scabrella, have proteoid roots, roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter. These roots are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient- poor soils, such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. B. scabrella is highly susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback. Killed by fire, the species regenerates from seed afterwards. The resultant seedlings have been recorded flowering two or three years after bushfires, although records are few. No pollinators were recorded during observations for the Banksia Atlas, although banksia flowerheads in general play host to a variety of birds, mammals and insects. The region between Geraldton and Gingin is a rich one for Abietinae banksias, and nine species occur there. Despite this, there is little overlap in range and habitat; Banksia scabrella is unusual in its co-occurrence with B. leptophylla. It is also associated with the endangered heath shrub Leucopogon marginatus. Burma Road Nature Reserve is one of the few protected conservation areas in its range; there, Banksia scabrella is found most commonly in (and forms a prominent part of) a mallee sedgeland, which is dominated by the cord rush Ecdeiocolea monostachya as a ground cover, and the mallee Eucalyptus eudesmoides as an emergent species. It is found occasionally in acacia scrub-heath, and rarely in acacia thickets and banksia woodland. An assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that its range is unlikely to contract and may actually grow, depending on how effectively it migrates into newly habitable areas. Cultivation Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 14 to 16 days to germinate. Rarely cultivated, Banksia scabrella flowers in 3 to 5 years from seed. Information is limited on its reliability, but it has been grown successfully in South Australia. It is fast-growing but ultimately untidy in habit, and would benefit from regular pruning. Some forms in the wild have a more compact habit, and are more promising for horticulture.

It is found in south west Western Australia from Dwellingup (32¬∞42‚Ä≤ S) to the Broke Inlet east of Denmark (34¬∞57‚Ä≤ S). It is often mistaken for, and was originally considered a subspecies of, the Banksia littoralis (Swamp Banksia). Stephen Hopper described the subspecies remanens as a short- leaved shrubby form found in the coastal sands below granite outcrops in the Walpole-Nornalup National Park, however George does not feel this form warrants taxonomic recognition as it lies within the normal variability of the species and there was no clear distinction between it and the other populations of B. seminuda.  Description  The river banksia generally grows as a tree up to 25 metres (80 ft) tall with a usually brown to grey trunk covered with a hard grey furrowed bark. The tree trunk is often straight and tall as the species generally grows in sheltered forest areas. The leaves are arranged on the stems in whorls. Measuring long and across, they are linear in shape with serrated margins. The upper leaf surface is finely furred becoming smooth, while the undersruface is covered in white fur. Flowering occurs between late summer and late winter. The yellow (occasionally red) flower spikes grow up to 200 mm (8 in) high by 70 mm (3 in) wide, the fruiting cones can remain on the trees for many years after shedding the flowers early. Its leathery leaves are between 70 mm (3 in) and 120 mm (5 in) long with fine teeth, subspecies remanens leaves have few if any teeth except at the tips of the leaves. Taxonomy The type specimen of Banksia seminuda was collected on 15 May 1973 in Nanga Brook, Western Australia by Alex George, who described it in 1981 as a subspecies of B. littoralis. He had published a taxonomic arrangement of Banksia in his landmark 1981 monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae). In 1984, botanist Barbara Rye of the Western Australian Herbarium noted that the two species did not interbreed when they occurred in stands together in the Two Peoples Bay region. This was despite an overlap in their flowering seasons. The bark of the trunk and flower structure differed greatly between the species. B. seminuda grew alongside rivers while B. littoralis grew in wet depressions. Endlicher's Eubanksia became B. subg. Banksia, and was divided into three sections, one of which was Oncostylis. Oncostylis was further divided into four series. After its discovery, B. seminuda placed in series Spicigerae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. Red-flowered form in late bud In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published a new arrangement for the genus, after cladistic analyses yielded a cladogram significantly different from George's arrangement. With respect to B. seminuda, their findings largely accorded with George's arrangement: section Oncostylis was discarded as polyphyletic, but series Spicigerae was inferred to be monophyletic, and B. seminuda appeared as the closest relative of a clades of B. littoralis and B. verticillata: This clade became the basis of Thiele and Ladiges' B. subser. Occidentales, which was defined as \\"characterised by opposite-decussate seedling leaves and adult leaves in true whorls.\\" This arrangement stood until 1999, when George largely reverted to his 1981 arrangement in his monograph for the Flora of Australia series. Under George's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia, B. seminudas taxonomic placement may be summarised as follows: :Banksia ::B. subg. Banksia :::B. sect. Banksia (9 series, 50 species, 9 subspecies, 3 varieties) :::B. sect. Coccinea (1 species) :::B. sect. Oncostylis ::::B. ser. Spicigerae (7 species, 2 subspecies, 4 varieties) :::::B. spinulosa (4 varieties) :::::B. ericifolia (2 subspecies) :::::B. verticillata :::::B. seminuda :::::B. littoralis :::::B. occidentalis :::::B. brownii A 2013 molecular study by Marcel Cardillo and colleagues using chloroplast DNA and combining it with earlier results found that B. seminuda was sister to a combined lineage that gave rise to B. quercifolia and B. oreophila. The ancestor of these three taxa had diverged almost 20 million years previously from the ancestor of the western Australian members of the Spicigerae and B. nutans. =Intraspecific variation= Banksia seminuda subspecies remanens was described by Stephen Hopper in 1989, from a specimen collected in Walpole-Nornalup National Park. He recorded distinctive populations of seminuda that were generally shrubs 2‚Äì3 m high and had smaller leaves that were 4‚Äì6 cm long and 0.5-0.8 cm wide. These occur within 1 km of the coast over a 30 km stretch of Western Australia's south coastline mostly within Walpole-Nornalup National Park, from Cliffy Head to Conspicuous Cliff. Hopper noted some intermediate stands with the usual tree forms at Broke Inlet and Coalmine Beach, and at Boggy Lake, around 600 m northwest of the summit of Mt Hopkins. George does not feel this form warrants taxonomic recognition as it lies within the normal variability of the species and there was no clear distinction between it and the other populations of B. seminuda.  Distribution and habitat  fissured trunk on 20-year-old tree, Banksia Farm, Mount Barker, WA This tree is found on the fringes of the rivers and creeks in Jarrah, Marri and Karri forests, between Dwellingup and Denmark. The short-leaved shrubby form is found in deep coastal sands below granite outcrops in the Walpole-Nornalup National Park. It grows as an emergent plant in coastal heath, associated with species such as mallee form of jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), basket bush (Spyridium globulosum), pineapple bush (Dasypogon bromeliifolius), prickly conostylis (Conostylis aculeata), coastal daisybush (Olearia axillaris), harsh hakea (Hakea prostrata) as well as bull banksia (Banksia grandis), oak-leaved banksia (B. quercifolia) and B. littoralis. It also grows in thickets of vegetation next to granite outcrops, associated with granite banksia (Banksia verticillata), Walpole wax (Chamelaucium floriferum), Taxandria marginata, heart-leaved poison (Gastrolobium bilobum), myrtle wattle (Acacia myrtifolia) and sticky tailflower (Anthocercis viscosa). Ecology Banksia seminuda is killed by bushfire and regenerates afterwards from seed. Scorching that circles the trunk will kill the plant. It grows in areas of lower flammability that only usually burn in summer and autumn. Juvenile plants take around 5 years to reach flowering post-fire. An assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that its range is likely to contract by between 30% and 80% by 2080, depending on the severity of the change. Cultivation B. seminuda is a vigorous and adaptable plant. There are reports of seedlings coming up near cultivated plants in Victoria which suggests caution should be advised if planting near bushland.

It occurs only within the Stirling Range in southwest Western Australia. Its scientific name honours the botanist Daniel Solander, one of the first collectors of Banksia. Description It is a woody shrub to 4 m (13 ft) high with large, broad serrate leaves and thick finely-furred stems. Flowering is in spring and early summer, the inflorescences are fawn in colour. Taxonomy B. solandri was first collected by William Baxter from the vicinity of King George Sound, and published by Robert Brown in his 1830 Supplementum primum Prodromi florae Novae Hollandiae. The name honors Daniel Solander, a student of Carl Linnaeus who accompanied Joseph Banks on the first voyage of James Cook, who collected the first specimens of Banksia to be scientifically described. In 1847 it was recollected from Mondurup in the Stirling Ranges by James Drummond. The following year Drummond published the name \\"Banksia hookeri\\" for the species: In 1856, this name was relegated to a synonym of Banksia solandri var. major, but that variety is no longer maintained, and B. hookeri is now considered a synonym of B. solandri. Banksia solandri has always been regarded as most closely related to Banksia grandis in the series Grandes, and more recent molecular studies support this arrangement. Cultivation Banksia solandri is extremely sensitive to dieback, however it is easily grafted onto Banksia integrifolia. The foliage makes for an attractive garden shrub. It will grow with a sunny aspect and well drained soil. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 36 to 71 days to germinate.

It is found on the south coast of Western Australia between Hopetoun (33¬∞57‚Ä≤ S) and the Great Australian Bight (approximately 33¬∞ S 130¬∞ E), growing on white or grey sand in shrubland. Reaching up to in height, it is a single-stemmed plant that has thin leaves with prominent triangular \\"teeth\\" along each margin, which are long and wide. The prominent cream-yellow flower spikes known as inflorescences appear throughout the year. As they age they develop up to 20 follicles each that store seeds until opened by fire. Though widely occurring, the species is highly sensitive to dieback and large populations of plants have succumbed to the disease. Collected and described by Robert Brown in the early 19th century, B. speciosa is classified in the series Banksia within the genus. Its closest relative is B. baxteri. B. speciosa plants are killed by bushfire, and regenerate from seed. The flowers attract nectar- and insect- feeding birds, particularly honeyeaters, and a variety of insects. In cultivation, B. speciosa grows well in a sunny location on well-drained soil in areas with dry summers. It cannot be grown in areas with humid summers, though it has been grafted onto Banksia serrata or B. integrifolia. Description B. integrifolia B. speciosa grows as a shrub or small tree anywhere from 1 to 6 or rarely 8 m (4‚Äì26 ft) high. It has an open many- branched habit, arising from a single stem or trunk with smooth grey bark. Unlike many banksias, it does not have a lignotuber. The plant puts on new growth, which is covered in rusty-coloured fur, in summer. The long thin leaves are linear, 20‚Äì45 cm (8‚Äì18 in) long and 2‚Äì4 cm (0.8‚Äì1.6 in) wide. They are bordered with 20 to 42 prominent triangular lobes that have a zigzag pattern. The lobes are long and wide, while the V-shaped sinuses between intrude almost to the midrib of the leaf. The leaf margins are slightly recurved. On the underside of each lobe, there are 3‚Äì10 nerves converging on the lobe apex. The midrib is raised on the leaf undersurface; it is covered with white hair when new but brownish hair when mature. The cream to yellow flower spikes, known as inflorescences, can appear at any time of year. They arise on the ends of one- or two-year-old stems and are roughly cylindrical in shape with a domed apex, measuring high and wide at anthesis. Each is a compound flowering structure, with a large number of individual flowers arising out of a central woody axis. A field study on the southern sandplains revealed an average count of 1369¬±79 on each spike. The perianth is grey-cream in bud, maturing to a more yellow or cream. The style is cream and the tip of the pollen-presenter maroon. Ageing spikes are grey, with old flowers remaining on them, and develop up to 20 large red follicles each. Roughly oval and jutting out prominently from the spike, each follicle is long by wide and high and is covered in dense fur, red-brown initially before aging to grey. It remains closed until opened by bushfire, and contains one or two viable seeds. The seed is long and fairly flattened, and is composed of the seed body proper, measuring long and wide, and a papery wing. One side, termed the outer surface, is grey and the other is dark brown; on this side the seed body protrudes and is covered with tiny filaments. The seeds are separated by a dark brown seed separator that is roughly the same shape as the seeds with a depression where the seed body sits adjacent to it in the follicle. It measures long and wide. The dull green cotyledons of seedlings are wider than they are long, measuring 1.4‚Äì1.5 cm (0.6 in) across and 1.2‚Äì1.3 cm (0.5 in) long, described by Alex George as \\"broadly obovate\\". Each cotyledon has a auricle at its base and has three faint nerve-like markings on its lower half. The hypocotyl is smooth and red. The seedling leaves emerge in an opposite arrangement and are deeply serrated into three triangular lobes on each side. The seedling stem is covered in white hair. A variant from the Gibson area has an upright habit and leaves. Otherwise, B. speciosa shows little variation across its range. Combined with its vigour and prominence in its habitat, this has led George to speculate that it is a recent development among its relatives. Banksia baxteri resembles B. speciosa and co-occurs with it at the western edge of B. speciosa's range, but has shorter, wider leaves with larger lobes, shorter flower spikes and is a smaller, more open shrub. Taxonomy Watercolour by Ferdinand Bauer c. 1811, painted from the sketches he made on board the Investigator, in the company of Robert Brown The first botanical collector of this species may well have been Claude Riche, naturalist to Bruni d'Entrecasteaux's 1791 expedition in search of the lost ships of Jean-Fran√ßois de Galaup, comte de La P√©rouse. During a visit to Esperance Bay, Riche explored an area in which B. speciosa is extremely common. However, he got lost and was forced to abandon his collections. The species was eventually collected by Robert Brown in 1802, and published by him in 1810. Alex George selected an 1802 specimen collected at Lucky Bay to be the lectotype in 1981. An early common name was handsome banksia. Common names include showy banksia and ricrac banksia, from the zigzag shape of its long thin leaves. Robert Brown recorded 31 species of Banksia in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen, and in his taxonomic arrangement, placed the taxon in the subgenus Banksia verae, the \\"True Banksias\\", because the inflorescence is a typical Banksia flower spike. By the time Carl Meissner published his 1856 arrangement of the genus, there were 58 described Banksia species. Meissner divided Brown's Banksia verae, which had been renamed Eubanksia by Stephan Endlicher in 1847, into four series based on leaf properties. He placed B. speciosa in the series Dryandroideae. George Bentham published a thorough revision of Banksia in his landmark publication Flora Australiensis in 1870. In Bentham's arrangement, the number of recognised Banksia species was reduced from 60 to 46. Bentham defined four sections based on leaf, style and pollen-presenter characters. B. speciosa was placed in section Orthostylis. In 1891, German botanist Otto Kuntze challenged the generic name Banksia L.f., on the grounds that the name Banksia had previously been published in 1775 as Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst, referring to the genus now known as Pimelea. Kuntze proposed Sirmuellera as an alternative, republishing B. speciosa as Sirmuellera speciosa. The challenge failed, and Banksia L.f. was formally conserved. =Current placement= Alex George published a new taxonomic arrangement of Banksia in his classic 1981 monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae). Endlicher's Eubanksia became B. subg. Banksia, and was divided into three sections. B. speciosa was placed in B. sect. Banksia, and this was further divided into nine series, with B. speciosa placed in B. ser. Banksia. He thought its closest relative was clearly Banksia baxteri based on their similar appearance, noting the two overlapped in their distribution. Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published a new arrangement for the genus in 1996; their morphological cladistic analysis yielded a cladogram significantly different from George's arrangement. Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement retained B. speciosa in series Banksia, placing it in B. subser. Cratistylis along with B. baxteri as its sister taxon and seven other Western Australian species. This arrangement stood until 1999, when George effectively reverted to his 1981 arrangement in his monograph for the Flora of Australia series. B. speciosa's placement within Banksia according to Flora of Australia is as follows: :Genus Banksia ::Subgenus Banksia :::Section Banksia ::::Series Banksia :::::B. serrata :::::B. aemula :::::B. ornata :::::B. baxteri :::::B. speciosa :::::B. menziesii :::::B. candolleana :::::B. sceptrum In 2002, a molecular study by Austin Mast again showed B. speciosa and B. baxteri to be each other's closest relatives, but they were only distantly related to other members of the series Banksia. Instead, their next closest relative turned out to be the distinctive Banksia coccinea. Mast, Eric Jones and Shawn Havery published the results of their cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for Banksia in 2005. They inferred a phylogeny greatly different from the accepted taxonomic arrangement, including finding Banksia to be paraphyletic with respect to Dryandra. A new taxonomic arrangement was not published at the time, but early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring Dryandra to Banksia, and publishing B. subg. Spathulatae for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons; in this way they also redefined the autonym B. subg. Banksia. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete. In the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. speciosa is placed in B. subg. Banksia. Distribution and habitat Distribution of B. speciosa (showy banksia), shown on a map of Western Australia's biogeographic regions. B. speciosa occurs on coastal dunes and sandplains in the Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions on the south coast of Western Australia, from East Mount Barren in the Fitzgerald River National Park and the vicinity of Hopetoun eastwards to Israelite Bay, generally within of the coast. The range extends inland to Mount Ragged and southwest of Grass Patch. There is an outlying population to the east at Point Culver on the Great Australian Bight. B. speciosa grows on flat or gently sloping ground on deep white or grey sand. It is often the dominant shrub in shrubland, commonly found with such species as Lambertia inermis, Banksia pulchella, and B. petiolaris. Ecology The prominent flower spikes are visited by many birds and insects. Honeyeaters are common visitors, particularly the New Holland honeyeater, as well as the fuscous honeyeater, western wattlebird and western spinebill. Other birds recorded foraging include the grey butcherbird and species of thornbill. Insects recorded include ants, bees, wasps, butterflies, moths, flies and beetles. The short-billed black cockatoo breaks off old cones with follicles to eat the seed, often doing so before the seed is ripe. B. speciosa is serotinous, that is, it has an aerial seed bank in its canopy in the form of the follicles of the old flower spikes. These are opened by fire and release seed in large numbers, which germinate and grow after rain. Seed can last for many years; old spikes 11 to 12 years old have been found to have 50% viable seed. Flower spikes appear to have similar numbers of follicles regardless of the age of the parent plant. Young plants begin flowering three years after regenerating from bushfire and store progressively larger numbers of old flowerheads (and hence seed) in the canopy. In one study, decade-old plants averaged around 3.5 old cones, whereas 21-year-old plants had 105, and were calculated as having over 900 viable seeds per plant. Plants appear to have a life span of at least 40 years, as healthy and vigorous individuals of this age are known. An experimental burn and monitoring of resultant seedling germination and growth showed B. speciosa seeds, though numerous, had poor rates of establishment but that seedlings were able to access water more easily and had higher rates of survival after two years than co-occurring Banksia species. Though this suggested B. speciosa might outcompete its conspecifics, the authors of the study noted that there could be other factors not accounted for in its natural environment. B. speciosa is extremely sensitive to dieback caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi and numbers in Cape Le Grand and Cape Arid National Parks have been drastically reduced as whole populations of plants have perished after exposure. It is an indicator species for the presence of the disease. Nursery plants in Italy perished from root and basal stem rot from the pathogen Phytophthora taxon niederhauserii. The tiny sac fungus Phyllachora banksiae subspecies westraliensis has been described from the leaves of B. speciosa, its sole host. This fungus manifests as round flat cream-coloured spots around 1‚Äì3 mm in diameter on the upper leaf surface. The surrounding leaf tissue is sometimes discoloured orange. One or two shiny black fruit bodies measuring around 0.25‚Äì0.75 by 0.25‚Äì1 mm appear in the centre of the spots. Cultivation A fast-growing and attractive plant, B. speciosa grows readily in a sunny location in dry climates on well-drained soil, but does poorly in areas of humid summer climate, such as Australia's east coast. It has been grafted successfully onto Banksia serrata and B. integrifolia to enable cultivation in these areas. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 27 to 41 days to germinate. A specimen flowered in a greenhouse in the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh in 1830. B. speciosa is an important cut flower crop. It was one of several species considered for commercial cropping in Tenerife, and trials showed that seedlings were moderately tolerant to salinity.

It is generally encountered as a high shrub, and is usually smaller in the north of its range. This species has narrow green leaves, and brownish, orange or yellow round flower spikes which may be seen from January to July. It is widely distributed across the southwest of Western Australia, growing exclusively in sandy soils. It is usually the dominant plant in scrubland or low woodland. It is pollinated by, and is a food source for, birds, mammals, and insects. First described in 1810 by botanist Robert Brown, B. sphaerocarpa has a complicated taxonomic history, and several taxa once classified as part of a broadly defined B. sphaerocarpa have since been named as species in their own right. At present, most authorities recognise five varieties; the largest variety, B. sphaerocarpa var. dolichostyla (ironcap banksia), is sometimes given species rank as B. dolichostyla. B. sphaerocarpa is classified as Not Threatened under the Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia, although two varieties have been placed on the Declared Rare and Priority Flora List‚Äîvar. latifolia has been designated a Priority Two ‚Äì Poorly Known taxon, and var. dolichostyla falls under Declared Rare Flora. None of the varieties are commonly seen in cultivation. Description Banksia sphaerocarpa is a variable species that differs in plant size, flower size and leaf size across its range. The variability is marked enough that five varieties are recognised. This species is generally a shrub tall. Plants are smaller in northern parts of the range, and grow larger in the southeast, with var. dolichostyla and rarely var. caesia reaching in height. All varieties bear a lignotuber, a swollen starchy root crown from which the plant resprouts after bushfire. The new stems are finely hairy but become smooth with maturity. The leaves are stiff, narrow and linear, and measure in length, on a petiole long. Leaves of most varieties are in width, and have a pointed tip, but var. latifolia has wider leaves, , and a blunter tip. The foliage is green, or a more pale blue-grey in the case of caesia and dolichostyla. alt=A globular mass covered in grey curled flower material with several large red seed pods embedded in it The inflorescences are generally globular and measure in diameter, although larger forms, such as var. dolichostyla, are more oval in shape. Flowering from January to July, the blooms are yellow, orange or brownish in colour. They take five to eight weeks to develop from bud to the finish of flowering. Anthesis takes place over two weeks, as the individual flowers open in a wave across the inflorescence. Three weeks before the flowers open, the spikes develop a strong musky smell. The flowers produce unusually large quantities of nectar; indeed some flowers produce so much that it drips to the ground. The old flowers fade to brownish and grey hues and remain curled around the flower spike. Up to 60 follicles develop on the globular spikes. The follicles are finely furred at first before becoming smooth and golden brown in colour, measuring long, high, and wide. The follicles are flat with pronounced 'shoulders', giving a rectangular appearance in cross section. Specimens of var. sphaerocarpa in the Whicher Range, Jarrah Forest and the vicinity of Nannup have larger follicles. The seeds are wedge-shaped (cuneate), and measure in length, containing a smaller cuneate seed body measuring long by wide. Northern specimens can be quite small shrubs and may be hard to distinguish from B. micrantha, which has smaller inflorescences and large flattened follicles. Taxonomy alt=low shrub about 1.5 metres high in low shrubland with fine leaved foliage The earliest known botanical collection of B. sphaerocarpa occurred in December 1801, during the visit of HMS Investigator to King George Sound. The specimen was collected from \\"A single plant observed between Princess Royal Harbour & Oyster Harbour on a heath\\", and is credited to English botanist Robert Brown, though it is not possible to be certain on this point, as Brown incorporated the collections of junior expedition members into his herbarium without attribution. Neither Brown nor expedition horticulturist Peter Good mentions the collection in his diary. Brown published a formal description and name for the species in his 1810 On the Proteaceae of Jussieu. He did not designate a type specimen (a specimen to be representative of the species) for the species, but the one specimen in his collection has since been formally declared the lectotype for the species. He also did not state the etymology of the specific epithet, but it is accepted that the name derives from the Ancient Greek sphaera- (\\"round\\"), and carpos (\\"fruit\\"), in reference to the shape of its infructescences. In Brown's arrangement of the genus, B. sphaerocarpa was placed between B. pulchella and B. nutans in taxonomic sequence; that is, an order that places related taxa next to each other. No subdivision of the genus was given, other than to separate a single distinctive species into a subgenus of its own. Swiss botanist Carl Meissner published a more detailed arrangement in 1856, placing B. sphaerocarpa in section Eubanksia because its inflorescence is a spike rather than a domed head, and in series Abietinae, whose members have inrolled leaf margins with no, or only very fine, serrations. Meissner also published a variety, B. sphaerocarpa var. glabrescens, based on specimens collected by James Drummond; this is now considered a synonym of B. incana. George Bentham's revision of Banksia for his 1870 Flora Australiensis overturned Meissner's series; instead, B. sphaerocarpa was placed in a new section, Oncostylis, because of its hooked styles. Two varieties were recognised: Meissner's var. glabrescens was retained, and var. latifolia was newly described by Bentham. Bentham noted further variation amongst his specimens not accounted for by his varieties, stating \\"It is possible therefore that two species may be here confounded, but the specimens are insufficient for their distinction.\\" For many years following Bentham's arrangement, the circumscription of B. sphaerocarpa was widely recognised as unacceptably broad. William Blackall informally published two varieties, var. pinifolia and var. violacea (properly Banksia violacea) in his 1954 How to Know Western Australian Wildflowers; and in 1966 the nurseryman Fred Lullfitz predicted that there were as many as eight taxa within the species. Several of these were recognised in George's revision of the genus for 1981 \\"The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)\\": B. micrantha, B. grossa, B. lanata, B. scabrella, B. telmatiaea, B. leptophylla and B. incana. George placed B. sphaerocarpa in subgenus Banksia because of its flower spike, section Oncostylis because its styles are hooked, and the resurrected series Abietinae, which he constrained to contain only round-fruited species. He reduced variety latifolia to synonymy with variety sphaerocarpa, but conceded the species needed further review. Alex George reported that he thought Banksia sphaerocarpa's closest relatives to be Banksia micrantha and B. grossa. George's arrangement remained current until 1996, when Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published an arrangement informed by a cladistic analysis of morphological characteristics. They retained George's subgenera and many of his series, but discarded his sections. Banksia ser. Abietinae was found to be very nearly monophyletic, and so retained. It further resolved into four subclades, so Thiele and Ladiges split it into four subseries. Banksia sphaerocarpa appeared in the second of these, initially called the ' grossa clade' for its most basal member. As with George's classification, B. grossa and B. micrantha emerged as close relatives of B. sphaerocarpa. This clade became the basis for new subseries Sphaerocarpae, which Thiele defined as containing those species with lignotubers, styles loosely curling around the infructescence (although this trait was reversed in micrantha), and \\"transversely aligned cells of the seed wing inner face\\". Other than the most basal B. grossa, these species also have shouldered follicles. Having found B. micrantha to be more closely related than B. sphaerocarpa var. dolichostyla to the other varieties of B. sphaerocarpa, they promoted var. dolichostyla to species rank as Banksia dolichostyla. Morphological support for this was given by the fact that the old styles of var. dolichostyla are quite different from those of other varieties, being stouter, and tending not to curl around the infructescence as the others do. Questioning the emphasis on cladistics in Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement, George published a slightly modified version of his 1981 arrangement in his 1999 treatment of Banksia for the Flora of Australia series of monographs. He added that he did not feel the characters of dolichostyla alone justified specific rank, being essentially merely larger in all parts than, but otherwise essentially similar to, var. caesia. Therefore, he retained it as a variety of B. sphaerocarpa. To date, George's 1999 arrangement remains the most recent comprehensive classification. The placement of B. sphaerocarpa in George's 1999 arrangement may be summarised as follows: :Banksia ::B. subg. Banksia :::B. sect. Banksia (9 series, 50 species, 9 subspecies, 3 varieties) :::B. sect. Coccinea (1 species) :::B. sect. Oncostylis ::::B. ser. Spicigerae (7 species, 2 subspecies, 4 varieties) ::::B. ser.

Isostylis (3 species) A 2002 study by American botanists Austin Mast and Tom Givnish yielded a surprise when molecular analysis mapped out dolichostyla as a sister taxon to its geographical neighbour B. violacea, in a clade with B. laricina and B. incana. B. micrantha and the other two varieties of B. sphaerocarpa form a separate clade nearby. Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of Banksia by merging Dryandra into it, and publishing B. subg. Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. sphaerocarpa is placed in B. subg. Spathulatae. In 2008, George reinstated B. sphaerocarpa var. latifolia, and published the new variety B. sphaerocarpa var. pumilio. =Varieties= alt=Closeup of spherical golden yellow bloom made up of hundreds of individual flowers Banksia sphaerocarpa is a widely distributed Western Australian species with four (or five if one includes var. dolichostyla) varieties: *B. sphaerocarpa var. caesia, first described by Alex George in his 1981 revision of the genus, grows larger than most other varieties, reaching , or occasionally , in height. It has yellow blooms and bluish grey foliage and is found in the central and southern Wheatbelt between the towns of Piawaning, Kojonup, Newdegate and Corrigin. *B. sphaerocarpa var. dolichostyla (Ironcap Banksia) was first described by Alex George in his 1981 revision of the genus. It is the largest of the varieties, encountered as a large shrub or small tree to high. It is larger in all parts than the other varieties, and has been considered a separate species. It is restricted to a small area from South Ironcap, east of Hyden, south to Mt Holland in the eastern Wheatbelt. *B. sphaerocarpa var. latifolia was originally described in a manuscript by Mueller and published by Bentham in 1870. It grows as a small rounded shrub to in height, and is restricted to the vicinity of the south coast between Denmark and the Porongorup Range, where it is found in low, open forest of Eucalyptus marginata and E. calophylla. *B. sphaerocarpa var. pumilio, first described by Alex George in 2008, is a small shrub less than a metre high. It is found from Tathra National Park east of Eneabba south to the Chittering valley. Its subspecific name is derived from the Latin pumilio \\"small\\", relating to the flowers. *B. sphaerocarpa var. sphaerocarpa is widely distributed from the Darling Plateau east of Perth to the Whicher Range in the southwest, and southeast to the Stirling Range. Populations north of Perth once referable to it are now classified as var. pumilio.

Colour changes also indicate overlaps in distribution, where multiple varieties co-occur.alt=Map of Western Australia, showing ranges of five varieties of Banksia sphaerocarpa, all concentrated in the southwest corner of the continent Banksia sphaerocarpa is distributed widely across southwestern Western Australia‚Äîfrom Eneabba in the north, south to the Whicher Range, Nannup, Albany and Jerramungup, and eastwards to the vicinity of Hyden. It is mainly found on sandy soils in flat or gently sloped areas in shrubland, mallee or open woodland. Conservation As a species, B. sphaerocarpa is not considered to be under threat, but two of the five varieties have been placed on the Declared Rare and Priority Flora List. B sphaerocarpa var. dolichostyla has been gazetted as \\"Declared Rare Flora ‚Äì Extant\\" under the Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. Banksia sphaerocarpa var. latifolia, though not afforded legislative protection, has been identified as a \\"Priority Two ‚Äì Poorly Known\\" taxon, because so few populations are known. Ecology Various animals, including mammals, birds, and insects such as bees, wasps, ants and beetles, have been recorded visiting Banksia sphaerocarpa inflorescences, including the colletid bee species Hylaeus sanguinipictus. Botanist Stephen Hopper found pollen of B. sphaerocarpa on New Holland honeyeaters (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae) and honey possums (Tarsipes rostratus) at Cheyne Beach in a field study published in 1980. Knowledge of the breeding system of B. sphaerocarpa comes from a 2009 study of genetic structure within and across fragmented plant populations, which made a case study of B. sphaerocarpa var. caesia populations in the vicinity of Dongolocking, where the landscape has been severely fragmented by land clearing. Very little self-pollination was observed. Most mating was between plants in the same population, but inter-population mating accounted for 15‚Äì33% of seed, a \\"very significant contribution... to overall reproductive dynamics\\". This figure was lowest in the smallest populations, which also exhibited lower rates of germination, smaller plants, and less genetic diversity than larger populations. One possible interpretation of this is that interpopulation mating confers a fitness advantage. There was also evidence of fine-scale genetic structure, with plants tending to be more closely related to nearby plants than to more distant plants. The authors suggest that gene flow was probably always limited in these populations, even before they were fragmented. Banksia sphaerocarpa is one of five closely related Banksia species that have highly unusual flower nectar. Whereas other Banksia species produce nectar that is clear and watery, the nectar of these species is pale yellow initially, but gradually becomes darker and thicker, changing to a thick, olive-green mucilage within one to two days of secretion, and eventually becoming \\"an almost black, gelatinous lump adhering to the base of the flowers\\". It was first noted by Byron Lamont in 1980; he attributed it to cyanobacteria that feed off the nectar sugars. Noting that many of these cyanobacteria had heterocysts, he speculated that they aid the plant by fixing atmospheric nitrogen, which is then washed off the flower heads by rain, and absorbed by the proteoid root mat. This purported symbiosis was investigated by Barrett and Lamont in 1985, but no evidence of nitrogen fixing was found. Further investigation by Markey and Lamont in 1996 suggested that the discolouration is not caused by cyanobacteria or other microorganisms in the nectar, but is rather \\"a chemical phenomenon of plant origin\\". Their analyses indicated that the nectar had unusually high levels of sugar and free amino acids, but three of these species, including B. sphaerocarpa, have since been shown to have normal nectar sugar compositions. Like most Western Australian Banksia species, B. sphaerocarpa is susceptible to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi. In one experiment, 43% of plants were dead within three months of inoculation, and the species was therefore rated as \\"moderately susceptible\\". In another experiment, 37% of plants were dead within three months, and 85% within a year; yet this study rated the species' susceptibility as \\"high\\". In the latter study, it took 35 to 40 days for the death rate to reach its maximum, and thereafter the death rate continued at that level throughout the year, only dipping slightly in the dry summer months. Cultivation None of the varieties of Banksia sphaerocarpa are commonly seen in cultivation. They are difficult to grow in the wetter conditions of Australia's east coast. Trials with grafting have been very limited and results have been poor. Otherwise, they adapt well to gardens with good drainage, sandy soils and sunny aspects in drier and Mediterranean (winter moisture) climates, and are also frost tolerant. They are good bird- attracting plants, and flower when not much else is in flower. Seeds do not require any treatment prior to sowing, and take 20 to 48 days to germinate.

The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. History In 1779, James Hollis, Sr. (1727-1794) erected the house where the second meeting of the Sullivan County Commissioners was conducted. The County Commissioners continued meeting there and at other houses until the land for the county seat in Blountville was donated in 1792. In 1784, John Yancey, a tavern owner from Abingdon, Virginia, purchased the Hollis house and converted the structure to Yancey's Tavern. The tavern continued to operate well into the nineteenth century. By the 1840s, ownership of the structure had passed to John Shaver. Operated as Shaver's Inn, the site served as a regular stagecoach stop on the route from Abingdon due to its location between Old Deery Inn in Blountville and Netherland Inn in Kingsport. Shaver's Inn is located approximately ten miles (16 kilometers) from both Old Deery Inn and Netherland Inn. The location was convenient since horses were normally changed after ten miles (16 kilometers) and drivers after twenty miles (32 kilometers). From 1842 to 1866, the building also served as the Eden's Ridge post office which had previously been located at the Exchange Place. In 1889, John Spahr of Southwest Virginia bought the house and from the Shaver family. In 1903, the existing barn was erected. The Spahr Farm continued operation until the early 1950s when East Lawn Cemetery was founded. Most of the former farm area is now occupied by the cemetery. The last occupant of the house was John Spahr's daughter, Mary. After her death in 1962, the house remained vacant for 42 years. Minimal maintenance of the structure was performed during the occupancy of Mary Spahr or the subsequent ownership by her heirs and nieces, Dorothy and Ruth Wexler. Upon the death of Ruth Wexler, an estate auction was held in 2004. The house was purchased and restored by Rann Vaulx. The barn was purchased and repaired by G. A. Agett. In 2006, Vaulx purchased the barn from Agett. Architectural details During the Shaver ownership, the original hewn logs were covered with poplar siding. The hewn and pegged rafters remain visible, however. The interior walls were also modified during the Shaver era. The walls of the east upstairs room received poplar plank panelling while the lower floor walls utilized laths and plaster. It is believed that the fireplace mantels also date from this period. The original plank doors with wrought iron strap hinges remain unmodified. After the purchase by John Spahr, the only major change to the house was the addition of a dining room connecting the previously separated kitchen to the remainder of the structure. The hewn timbers of the barn stand on a cut stone foundation. Marked with Roman numerals and joined with wooden pegs, the timbers of the barn appear to have come from an earlier barn. Current utilization Yancey's Tavern was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. From 2004 to 2006, Rann Vaulx restored the site for the citizens of Sullivan County and Tennessee. The house was furnished with reproductions of furniture from the late eighteenth century. A cupboard, blanket chest, and dining room table from the early nineteenth century are also presently displayed. A ledger detailing the materials and costs of the barn construction was maintained by John Spahr and is exhibited today. During restoration, a fragment of quilt was found behind a wall in Yancey's Tavern. It is believed that the quilt was made by the wife of John Spahr or his daughter Mary Spahr. The fragment has been framed and placed on display. A painted quilt square, Grandmother's Flower Garden, was inspired by the fragment and hangs on the side of the barn. The tavern is currently shown by appointment and is also available for use by church groups or groups dedicated to historic preservation, patriotism, or genealogy. On April 26, 2014 the Northeast Tennessee Mustang Club made a stop at the tavern during their \\"Island Road Run\\" cruise to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Ford Mustang. There were 21 cars in attendance for the cruise and were parked along the front of the tavern.

It grows as an upright bush up to tall, with narrow leaves and a pale brown flower spike, which can produce profuse quantities of nectar. First collected in the 1840s, it was not published as a separate species until 1981; as with several other similar species it was previously included in B. sphaerocarpa (fox banksia). The shrub grows amongst scrubland in seasonally wet lowland areas of the coastal sandplain between Badgingarra and Serpentine in Western Australia. A little studied species, not much is known of its ecology or conservation biology. Reports suggest that it is pollinated by a variety of birds and small mammals. Like many members of series 'Abietinae', it has not been considered to have much horticultural potential and is rarely cultivated.  Description  B. telmatiaea grows as an upright bush up to 2 m (7 ft) high. It has hairy stems and branchlets, and straight, narrow leaves from 1¬Ω to 3 centimetres (¬Ω‚Äì1 inches) long and about a millimetre ( in) wide. The leaves have a green upper surface and white hairy undersurface. The new growth is pale brown, later turning green. Closeup of foliage Flowers occur in \\"flower spikes\\", inflorescences made up of hundreds of flower pairs densely packed around a woody axis. Arising from short lateral branchlets off stems older than four years of age, the inflorescence of B. telmatiaea is roughly oval to cylindrical, with a height of 3‚Äì5 cm (1‚Äì2 in) and diameter of 4‚Äì7 cm (1‚Äì2 in). It contains between 500 and 900 golden brown to pale brown flowers, each of which consists of a tubular perianth made up of four fused tepals, and one long wiry style. The styles are hooked rather than straight, and are initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but break free at anthesis. The species generally flowers from April to August, although flowers have been observed as late as November. They take five to six weeks to develop from bud, then reach anthesis over a period of two weeks. The flowers produce unusually large quantities of nectar; indeed some flowers produce so much that it drips to the ground. The fruiting structure is a stout woody \\"cone\\", with a hairy appearance caused by the persistence of old withered flower parts. Up to 70 woody follicles, each of which contains a single seed, may be embedded in the cone. As with other Banksia species, only a small proportion of flowers go on to form follicles; in the case of B. telmatiaea, the proportion is around 4% for those \\"cones\\" that set some fruit. About 80% of fruiting structures set no fruit at all. According to John K. Scott, \\"there [is] no obvious reason on the basis of morphology of pollination for this lack of seed set\\".  Taxonomy  Inflorescence in late bud Fruiting structure with persistent flowers and closed follicles = Discovery and naming = B. telmatiaea was first collected around 1840 by Ludwig Preiss and James Drummond. For many years it was included in B. sphaerocarpa, but by 1980 it was recognised as a distinct species. In recognition of its distinctness from, yet affinity with, B. sphaerocarpa, it was for a time informally referred to as Banksia aff. Sphaerocarpa. It was eventually published by Alex George in his 1981 monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae), based on a specimen collected by him on the Brand Highway about 45 kilometres (28 miles) north of Regans Ford on 14 May 1969, and labelled \\"A.S. George 9309\\". He found it most closely resembled B. leptophylla, but regarded its preference for swampy rather than sandy soils and winter flowering as worthy of warranting species status. George gave it the specific name telmatiaea from the Greek stem telmat-/œÑŒµŒªŒºŒ±œÑ- (\\"the mud of a pond\\"), in reference to its swampy habitat. Thus the full name for the species is Banksia telmatiaea A.S.George. Common names for B. telmatiaea include swamp fox banksia and marsh banksia. = Infrageneric placement = George placed B. telmatiaea in subgenus Banksia because its inflorescence is a typical Banksia flower spike, section Oncostylis because it has hooked styles, and series Abietinae because its inflorescence is roughly spherical. He considered its closest relative to be B. leptophylla (Slender-leaved Banksia), which differs from B. telmatiaea in having longer leaves and larger flowers; yet in his arrangement he placed it between B. scabrella (Burma Road Banksia) and B. laricina (Rose-fruited Banksia). In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published the results of a cladistic analysis of morphological characters of Banksia. They retained George's subgenera and many of his series, but discarded his sections. B. ser. Abietinae was found to be very nearly monophyletic, and so retained. It further resolved into four subclades, so Thiele and Ladiges split it into four subseries. B. telmatiaea appeared in the third of these: This clade became the basis of B. subser. Leptophyllae, which Thiele defined as containing those species with \\"indurated and spinescent common bracts on the infructescence axes, and densely arachnose seedling stems.\\" In accordance with their cladogram, their arrangement placed B. telmatiaea next to B. scabrella. Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement was not accepted by George, and was largely discarded by him in his 1999 arrangement. B. ser. Abietinae was restored to George's 1981 circumscription, and all of Thiele and Ladiges' subseries were abandoned. B. telmatiaea was moved in the phyletic order to between B. grossa (Coarse Banksia) and B. leptophylla, thus better according with the affinity with B. leptophylla claimed by George in 1981. The placement of B. telmatiaea in George's 1999 arrangement may be summarised as follows: :Banksia ::B. subg. Banksia :::B. sect. Banksia (9 series, 50 species, 9 subspecies, 3 varieties) :::B. sect. Coccinea (1 species) :::B. sect. Oncostylis ::::B. ser. Spicigerae (7 species, 2 subspecies, 4 varieties) ::::B. ser. Tricuspidae (1 species) ::::B. ser. Dryandroideae (1 species) ::::B. ser. Abietinae :::::B. sphaerocarpa (3 varieties) :::::B. micrantha :::::B. grossa :::::B. telmatiaea :::::B. leptophylla (2 varieties) :::::B. lanata :::::B. scabrella :::::B. violacea :::::B. incana :::::B. laricina :::::B. pulchella :::::B. meisneri (2 subspecies) :::::B. nutans (2 varieties) ::B. subg. Isostylis (3 species) Since 1998, Austin Mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is very different from George's arrangement. With respect to B. telmatiaea, Mast's results accord closely with Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement, inferring a polytomous clade consisting of B. leptophylla, B. telmatiaea, B. scabrella and B. lanata, with B. grossa (Coarse Banksia) as the nearest outgroup: Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of Banksia by merging Dryandra into it, and publishing B. subg. Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. telmatiaea is placed in B. subg. Spathulatae.  Distribution and habitat  B. telmatiaea grows only in the Swan Coastal Plain, Geraldton Sandplains and Jarrah Forest biogeographic regions, inland from the coast but never east of the Darling Scarp. It occurs from Hill River near Badgingarra in the north, to Serpentine in the south. Most populations occur north of Moore River or south of Cannington, there being only a few scattered populations in between. The species favours lowland areas that are seasonally wet but never inundated, such as the margins of swamps and marshes. For example, in the Yule Brook Botany Reserve, where parallel sand ridges cross a clay flat, B. telmatiaea occurs neither in the lowest parts of the flat, where seasonal inundation occurs; nor on the tops of the ridges, where the drainage is good; but it is one of the most abundant plants of intermediate habitats, on ridge slopes and in higher areas of the clay flat. Favoured soils are deep grey sandy loams or shallower sand overlying claypan. Associated vegetation is typically scrubland or shrubland, although moisture- loving trees such as B. littoralis (swamp banksia) or Melaleuca preissiana (moonah) may also be present, sometimes in sufficient numbers to form a low open woodland.  Ecology  Like most other Proteaceae, B. telmatiaea has proteoid roots, roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter. These roots are particularly efficient at absorbing nutrients from nutrient-poor soils, such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. Unlike many Banksia species, B. telmatiaea lacks a lignotuber, so plants are killed by bushfire. It is adapted to release its aerial seed bank following a bushfire, and so regenerates rapidly. This behaviour, known as serotiny, makes B. telmatiaea dependent upon a suitable fire regime for successful regeneration; indeed, excessive fire frequency may be one reason why B. telmatiaea does not occur further south, despite suitable habitat throughout southwest Australia. Unlike most serotinous Banksia species, the seeds of B. telmatiaea are not released immediately after the passage of a bushfire. The follicles open straight away, but at first the seeds are blocked from falling out by the winged seed separator. If moistened, these wings close up, and as they dry they open out again, levering the seeds out of position, making it possible for them to fall. This adaptation ensures that seeds are released only after the first rains following a bushfire. Bushfire kills adult plants, but also triggers the release of seed, ensuring rapid regeneration Recruitment of seedlings at the same location four months later Four species of bird have been observed visiting the flowers of B. telmatiaea: the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae) and the brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta). The introduced European honeybee (Apis mellifera) is also commonly observed, and visits by ants and Hylaeus plasterer bees have been recorded. Visits by nectarivorous mammals have not been directly observed, but their involvement in pollination is certain, as their scats have often been found on inflorescences, and studies of other Banksia species have consistently demonstrated their involvement. Moreover, a number of characteristics of the B. telmatiaea spike are purported to be adaptations to pollination by nocturnal mammals: the strong, musky odour, the occurrence of inflorescences hidden within the foliage close to the ground, the large amounts of nectar produced, and the pattern of nectar production, which peaks at dawn and dusk. This last adaptation is thought to favour visits by birds and mammals, which feed in the morning and evening respectively, as opposed to insects, which are most active during the day. Reproductive success is strongly affected by insects that infest the flower spikes and fruiting structures. Infestation of the flower spikes is not as severe as in other Banksia species: one study found less than 10% of B. telmatiaea inflorescences to be infested, compared to over 50% for B. attenuata (candlestick banksia), B. littoralis and B. menziesii (Menzies' banksia), and over 90% for B. grandis (bull banksia). Also, whereas other species were attacked by a range of insects, the inflorescence of B. telmatiaea was attacked only by the tortrix moth Arotrophora arcuatalis (banksia boring moth), which burrows into the woody axis, rendering the spike barren. On the other hand, the same study observed heavy infestation of fruiting structures, with over 90% of spikes with follicles found to contain at least one larva of an unidentified species of moth of the genus Xylorycta. These larvae burrow from follicle to follicle to eat the seed, resulting in 100% seed loss for infested spikes. B. telmatiaea is one of five Banksia species, all closely related to B. sphaerocarpa, that have highly unusual flower nectar. Whereas other Banksia species produce nectar that is clear and watery, the nectar of these species is pale yellow initially, but gradually becomes darker and thicker, changing to a thick, olive-green mucilage within one to two days of secretion. (only abstract sighted) In the case of B. telmatiaea, it eventually becomes \\"an almost black, gelatinous lump adhering to the base of the flowers\\". This unusual nectar was first noted in 1980 by Byron Lamont, who attributed its transformation to the cyanobacteria that he observed feeding off the nectar sugars. Noting that many of these cyanobacteria had heterocysts, he speculated that they aid the plant by fixing atmospheric nitrogen, which is then washed off the flower heads by rain, and absorbed by the proteoid root mat. This purported symbiosis was investigated in 1985, but no evidence of nitrogen fixing was found. Further investigations in 1996 suggested that the discolouration is not caused by cyanobacteria or other microorganisms in the nectar, but is rather \\"a chemical phenomenon of plant origin\\". As of February 2007, the cause was still unknown. Chemical analysis of B. telmatiaea nectar has shown it to have a normal nectar sugar composition, albeit dominated by sucrose.  Conservation  B. telmatiaea among scrub in the Yule Brook Botany Reserve B. telmatiaea is a fairly secure species, as most populations are of more than 100 plants, and 26% of known plants are in conservation reserves. Its proximity to Perth suggests that land clearing for urban development could pose a threat, and in 1988 The Banksia Atlas recommended that \\"the species should continue to be monitored since land clearing could change the situation greatly, particularly amongst its northern populations.\\" It is also known to be susceptible to dieback caused by the introduced plant pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi, a soil-borne water mould that causes root rot; in fact it is so reliably susceptible that it is used as an indicator species for the presence of the disease. An assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that severe change is likely to lead to extinction; but under less severe change scenarios the distribution may actually grow, depending on how effectively it can migrate into newly habitable areas. In 1987, George applied the Rare or Threatened Australian Plants (ROTAP) criteria to the species, determining it to have a conservation status of \\"3R\\": a rare species found only in small populations, but not considered endangered or vulnerable. Western Australia's Department of Parks and Wildlife do not consider it to be rare, and have not included it on their Declared Rare and Priority Flora List.  Cultivation  B. telmatiaea flowers prolifically, but hides its flower spikes within the bush, and tends to become untidy with age B. telmatiaea is rarely cultivated. It grows fairly quickly, but tends to become untidy as it ages. The flower spikes, though attractive, occur within the bush where they are usually obscured by foliage. In its natural habitat it flowers prolifically over several months, but according to George it may be reluctant to flower in cultivation. It tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage. George recommends a sunny position in poorly drained soil, preferably with moisture in winter. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take around 14 days to germinate.

It is a stunted tree or shrub with narrow leaves and cylindrical spikes of golden-coloured flowers and it occurs in a geographic range of just 15 square kilometres near Jurien. Description Banksia tricuspis is a shrub or small tree, often with an irregular shape, which grows to a height of with thick, grey, wrinkled, fire-resistant bark on its trunk. New growth is produced in spring and is pale greenish-brown. The leaves are mostly crowded near the ends of the branches, linear in shape, long wide with the edges rolled under and end in three pointed teeth. The upper surface of the leaves is covered with soft hairs at first but becomes glabrous as the leaves mature. The lower surface is woolly. As with many other members of the genus, inflorescences or flower spikes may contain hundreds or thousands of individual flowers, each of which consists of a tube-shaped perianth made up of four joined tepals, and one long wiry style. In this species the spike is on the end of a branch and is long and wide when the flowers open. Each perianth is golden-yellow, long, hairy on the outside but glabrous inside. Flowering occurs from late March to July. Only up to 35 of the flowers on a spike will form seeds and these are contained in large, woody fruit called follicles. In B. tricuspis, these protrude from the spike and are elliptic in shape, high and wide, glabrous and slightly rough. The fruit remain closed until the plant is heated during a fire, after which one or two winged seeds are released from each follicle. B. tricuspis habit in Lesueur National Park B. tricuspis leaves B. tricuspis young inflorescence Taxonomy and naming Banksia tricuspis was first formally described by Carl Meissner in 1855 from specimens collected by James Drummond and the description was published in Hooker's Journal of Botany and Kew Garden Miscellany. The specific epithet (tricuspis) is a Latin word meaning \\"having three points\\", referring to the three teeth on the leaf tips. This species is placed alone in series Banksia ser. Tricuspidae. Distribution and habitat This banksia only occurs around Mount Lesueur in Lesueur National Park in the Geraldton Sandplains biogeographic region. It grows in rocky lateritic soil in shrubland. Ecology This plant is fire tolerant and new growth sprouts from epicormic buds after fire. There is evidence that black cockatoos (genus Calyptorhynchus) increase the rate of seed set by selectively destroying borers. Conservation Banksia tricuspis is classified as \\"Priority Four\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that is rare or near threatened. It is only known from an area of . Use in horticulture This is a slow-growing plant and may take 10 years to flower for the first time. The foliage is sparse except for at the branch tips and the flower spikes and old fruit are attractive. It grows best in sandy or rocky soil in a sunny location. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 18 to 57 days to germinate.

History Quickspace formed in London, originally under the name Quickspace Supersport. Tom Cullinan, vocalist and guitarist, was formerly in Th' Faith Healers but developed their punky sound into a more tuneful but experimental style. Quickspace formed their own record label called Kitty Kitty, but while releasing many of their records through this, also released on other labels such as Domino Records and Elefant Records. Their first single, 'Found a Way', was released on the Love Train label, followed later that year by Superplus, an EP released on Domino, which got into the Indie Top 40. Three of the original members (Wendy, Max and Barry) left the band, leaving Tom and Sean. They dropped the 'Supersport' part of the name and started working again, with Nina Pascale (vocals/guitar), Paul Shilton (keyboards) and Chin (drums). 'Friend', the first single recorded with the new line-up, came out in early 1996 and was reminiscent of Th' Faith Healers. It was the second release on Kitty Kitty, after the band had decided to decline offers by other labels, keep a low profile and release their music themselves. Meanwhile, work on their first full-length album had begun. It was released in autumn 1996, following the release of another single, 'Rise'. The album itself, simply titled Quickspace, had mostly favourable reviews. In spring 1997, a collection of their early singles and rare tracks was released on the low-priced album Supo Spot. It was followed later that year by 'The Precious Mountain' EP. A new single, 'Hadid', came out in May 1998. Chin, who was always only supposed to be just on a temporary assignment, left the band about the same time and was replaced by Steve Denton. Another 7\\", 'Quickspace Happy Song #2' came out in June, together with the Precious Little EP, which contains the songs from the 'Hadid' and 'Happy Song #2' 7-inches on one CD. Precious Falling, the second album proper, was released on CD and double vinyl on 31 August 1998. The album had been recorded in late 1997/early 1998 with Chin still on drums. The band went on tour across much of Europe, including a gig supporting Yo La Tengo in London and a set of gigs with labelmates Novak and Ligament in the UK. In 2000, the band released The Death of Quickspace to much critical acclaim, followed by the 'Flat Moon Society' single later that year. Tom Cullinan released a complete cover of Fleetwood Mac's 'Rumours' LP under the pseudonym Dougal Reed, but no new Quickspace songs materialised for over three years. In 2003, an unexpected single was released on the Italian Homesleep label, but it would take two more years until a completely renewed Quickspace featuring Cullinan, Ed Grimshaw (drums), Louis Jack-Jones (bass) and ex-Th' Faith Healer Roxanne Stephen (vocals) released their next single 'Pissed Off Boy' on the Domino label in 2005. After this Cullinan reformed Th' Faith Healers for some concerts in early 2006 but there has been no further activity under the Quickspace label. Quickspace's label Kitty Kitty operated from 1995 to 2001 and also released albums by Broken Dog, Dougal Reed, Ligament, Novak, and Penthouse.

It is native to the southwest of Western Australia and can reach up to 3 m (10 ft) in height. It can grow taller to 5 m (16 ft) in sheltered areas, and much smaller in more exposed areas. This species has elliptic green leaves and large, bright golden yellow inflorescences or flower spikes, appearing in summer and autumn. The New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae) is the most prominent pollinator, although several other species of honeyeater, as well as bees, visit the flower spikes. A declared vulnerable species, it occurs in two disjunct populations on granite outcrops along the south coast of Western Australia, with the main population near Albany and a smaller population near Walpole, and is threatened by dieback (Phytophthora cinnamomi) and aerial canker (Zythiostroma). B. verticillata is killed by bushfire and new plants regenerate from seed afterwards. Populations take over a decade to produce seed and fire intervals of greater than twenty years are needed to allow the canopy seed bank to accumulate. Description Banksia verticillata grows as a spreading, bushy shrub with many branches up to 3 m (10 ft) high, but can reach 5 m (16 ft) high in sheltered locations. It may be much lower or even adopt a prostrate habit in highly exposed areas which are blasted by high wind, or occasionally grow as a single-trunked tree. The rough grey bark has fissures, the stems and branches are finely hairy when young and become smooth with age. The leathery bright green leaves are arranged whorled, or alternately on branches, and are borne on 0.5‚Äì1.1 mm long petioles. They measure 3‚Äì9 cm (1.4‚Äì3.8 in) in length, and 0.7‚Äì1.2 cm (0.3‚Äì0.5 in) in width, and are elliptic in shape with entire (straight) recurved margins. They are initially hairy and become smooth with maturity, although their undersides remain covered with white hair. The golden-yellow inflorescences appear in summer and autumn (January to April) and are 8‚Äì20 cm (3‚Äì8 in) high and 6.5 cm (2.6 in) wide. The smooth pistils are 3‚Äì3.5 cm long and hooked at the end. Individual flowers open from the base of the flower spike, the wave of anthesis moving up the inflorescence. Occasionally, flowers on exposed parts may open early. It takes around 9.5 days for all flowers to open, and rates are similar during the day and night.Rees, R.G.; Collins, B.G. (1994). Reproductive biology and pollen vectors of the rare and endangered Banksia verticillata R.Br. pp. 1‚Äì35. School of Environmental Biology. Curtin University of Technology, Perth. The inflorescences age to grey and the individual old flowers linger for some time before falling. Up to 100 small woody follicles may follow on old flower spikes. Measuring 1.1‚Äì1.5 cm wide, 3‚Äì4 mm wide, and jutting out 2‚Äì3 mm from the spike, they open after several years, releasing the seed. Follicles more commonly appear in the middle third of the spike. The reasons for this are unknown, although timing of visits by pollinators or some anatomical factor may be relevant. Taxonomy =Discovery and naming= King George's Sound, view on the peninsula to the north of Peak Head, a field sketch executed by William Westall in December 1801. The sprawling shrub in the foreground has been tentatively identified as B. verticillata, which would make this sketch, together with another Westall sketch thought to depict B. verticillata, the earliest known drawings of the species. The earliest known botanical collection of B. verticillata was made by Scottish surgeon and naturalist Archibald Menzies during the visit of the Vancouver Expedition to King George Sound in September and October 1791. As a result of this collection the species was introduced into cultivation in England, yet it did not result in formal publication of the species. The next known collection was in December 1801, during the visit of HMS Investigator to King George Sound. Little is known of the circumstances of this collection, other than what is written on the specimen label: \\"King Georges Sound Dec[embe]r 1801\\". The specimen is credited to Robert Brown, but gardener Peter Good and the botanical artist Ferdinand Bauer also contributed to Brown's specimen collection, often without attribution. A more precise date and location cannot be given, as neither Brown nor Good mentions the collection in his diary. Bauer did not publish an illustration of the species and his original field sketches are lost, but William Westall appears to have incorporated it into two of his field sketches, and certainly included it in the foreground of one of the oil paintings that he later worked up for the Admiralty. Brown formally described and named the species in his 1810 On the Proteaceae of Jussieu. He did not identify a type specimen, but the one specimen in his collection has since been formally declared the lectotype for the species. He also did not explicitly give an etymology for the specific epithet, but it is accepted that the name derives from the Latin verticillatus (\\"whorled\\"), in reference to the whorled leaf arrangement. No subspecies or varieties of Banksia verticillata have been identified; it has no taxonomic synonyms; and its only nomenclatural synonym is Sirmuellera verticillata (R.Br.) Kuntze, which arose from Otto Kuntze's unsuccessful 1891 attempt to replace Banksia with the new name Sirmuellera. =Infrageneric placement= In Brown's arrangement of Banksia, B. verticillata was placed between B. compar (now B. integrifolia subsp. compar) and B. coccinea (scarlet banksia) in phyletic order. No infrageneric arrangement was provided other than the removal of one distinctive species into a subgenus of its own, because of its unusual domed flower head. As B. verticillata flowers occur in characteristic flower spikes, it was retained in Banksia verae, the \\"true banksias\\". Banksia verae was renamed Eubanksia by Austrian botanist Stephan Endlicher in 1847, with B. verticillata remaining between the same two species as in Brown's sequence. A more detailed arrangement was published by Carl Meissner in 1856. Eubanksia was demoted to sectional rank, and divided it into four series. B. verticillata was placed in series Salicinae because its leaves are more or less linear, and have white undersides. Based as they were on leaf characters, Meissner's series were highly heterogeneous, and George Bentham discarded them all in his 1870 revision of Banksia. B. verticillata was instead placed in a new section, Oncostylis, because of its hooked styles. This arrangement would stand for over a century. For many years there was confusion between B. verticillata and B. littoralis (swamp banksia). Until 1984, the latter was circumscribed as encompassing what is now Banksia seminuda (river banksia), which has whorled leaves like B. verticillata. Thus it was easy to perceive B. verticillata as falling within the range of variation of this broadly defined species. The confusion was largely cleared up once B. seminuda was recognised as a distinct taxon. Alex George published a new taxonomic arrangement of Banksia in his landmark 1981 monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae). Endlicher's Eubanksia became B. subg. Banksia, and was divided into three sections, one of which was Oncostylis. Oncostylis was further divided into four series, with B. verticillata placed in series Spicigerae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published a new arrangement for the genus, after cladistic analyses yielded a cladogram significantly different from George's arrangement. With respect to B. verticillata, their findings largely accorded with George's arrangement: section Oncostylis was discarded as polyphyletic, but series Spicigerae was inferred to be monophyletic, and B. verticillata appeared in a succession of clades with the species previously identified as its closest relatives: first B. littoralis, then B. seminuda, then B. brownii, and finally B. occidentalis (red swamp banksia): This clade became the basis of Thiele and Ladiges' B. subser. Occidentales, which was defined as \\"characterised by opposite- decussate seedling leaves and adult leaves in true whorls.\\" This arrangement stood until 1999, when George largely reverted to his 1981 arrangement in his monograph for the Flora of Australia series. Under George's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia, B. verticillatas taxonomic placement may be summarised as follows: :Banksia ::B. subg. Banksia :::B. sect. Banksia (9 series, 50 species, 9 subspecies, 3 varieties) :::B. sect. Coccinea (1 species) :::B. sect. Oncostylis ::::B. ser. Spicigerae (7 species, 2 subspecies, 4 varieties) :::::B. spinulosa (4 varieties) :::::B. ericifolia (2 subspecies) :::::B. verticillata :::::B. seminuda :::::B. littoralis :::::B. occidentalis :::::B. brownii ::::B. ser. Tricuspidae (1 species) ::::B. ser. Dryandroideae (1 species) ::::B. ser. Abietinae (13 species, 2 subspecies, 9 varieties) ::B. subg. Isostylis (3 species) More recent molecular research by Austin Mast and colleagues provide further support of B. verticillatas placement among its nearest relatives, but these do not appear to be closely related to the remaining members of B. ser. Spicigerae, but rather occur in a clade that is sister (next closest relative) to B. nutans: (B. seminuda is omitted because it was not sampled in the study, not because it occurs elsewhere in the cladogram.) Distribution and habitat Banksia verticillata is found in scattered populations in two disjunct segments: one clustered around Walpole, and the other around Albany and eastwards to Cheynes Beach. All but one are located within 2 km (1.5 mi) of the coast, the exception is less than 10 km (6 mi) inland. Plants grow on exposed coastal granite outcrops, often in cracks within boulders as well as shallow rocky soils. It is the only Banksia which grows exclusively in a granite soil. pp. 240‚Äì41 It grows in association with Taxandria marginata, Western Australian peppermint (Agonis flexuosa), Andersonia sprengelioides and species of Hakea in scrub and heath. Ecology The New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae) is a major visitor and pollinator of Banksia verticillata. These birds can travel 15 m (50 ft) between inflorescences in a feeding session, and preferentially choose flower spikes with partly opened flowers. Other honeyeater species observed, the white-cheeked honeyeater (Phylidonyris nigra) and western spinebill (Acanthorhynchus superciliosus), visit this species to a much lesser extent. The brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta) has also been recorded as a visitor. Small mammals are not major pollinators, although bush rats (Rattus fuscipes) and house mice (Mus musculus) have been recorded. Honey bees (Apis mellifera) visit flower spikes but are not effective pollinators. B. verticillata is significantly threatened by at least three microorganisms. Several populations have reduced or vanished from dieback (Phytophthora cinnamomi), such as those at Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve and Gull Rock National Park. The honey fungus Armillaria luteobubalina has killed plants in Torndirrup National Park, and aerial canker (Zythiostroma) has decimated populations at Waychinicup National Park east of Albany. B. verticillata plants are generally killed by fire and regenerate from seed. A field study after a mild fire in Torndirrup National Park published in 1994 found that plants burnt by fire were ten times as likely to have seedlings come up under their crown as unburnt plants (with an average of 25.2 seedlings per burnt plant), and burnt spikes released double the number of seeds as unburnt spikes. Despite this, interfire recruitment (seedlings arising between fires) has also been recorded, and might be more common than in other Banksia species. Observations at several of the populations showed many plants produced their first seed anywhere from 13 to 17 years of age, leading to a recommendation of 20 years between fires to allow seed banks to accumulate. If fire occurs too frequently, plants are burned before reaching maturity or before they have produced sufficient seed to ensure regeneration of the population. This may cause a population decline or even local extinction. Too long a time between fires also causes population decline, as more plants die of natural attrition without releasing their seed, resulting in seed wastage. Conservation Banksia verticillata has been declared vulnerable under the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, and Rare under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. A 1995 census yielded an estimated total population size of 4500 plants. Apart from dieback and aerial canker, frequency of bushfires and illegal picking have been cited as threats. Ongoing management includes monitoring of current populations, gathering more data on best response to fire, and restricting access to populations. Seed has been collected from many populations, but germination rates after ten years of storage are much lower than in Banksia brownii. Translocation is considered an option in the future, as is spraying with phosphite, particularly in the vicinity of Walpole. Used successfully on B. brownii but as yet untrialled with B. verticillata, phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed as studies have shown that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth. Cultivation Banksia verticillata is seldom seen in cultivation. The natural growing conditions point to a sunny aspect and good drainage as being important in cultivation. It is good for coastal situations and erosion control. Very sensitive to dieback, B. verticillata (like most other western Australian banksias) perishes quickly in humid conditions or poor drainage. It has been grafted successfully onto Banksia integrifolia. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 49 days to germinate.

It occurs in Western Australia between Northampton, Western Australia and Kalbarri, with the occasional plant further north as far as Zuytdorp Nature Reserve. Description B. victoriae generally grows as a tall shrub, but older plants sometimes attain a tree habit, growing as high as seven metres. It has smooth grey back and densely hairy stems. Leaves are long and wide, with deep triangular lobes and woolly surfaces. Flowers occur in typical Banksia \\"flower spikes\\", inflorescences made up of hundreds of pairs of flowers densely packed in a spiral about a woody axis. B. victoriae's inflorescence is orange, long. After flowering, up to 30 follicles develop in the flower spike. These are usually concealed by withered flower parts, which persist on the spike for a long time. Taxonomy =Discovery and naming= A scan of Plate 1728 of Edwards's Botanical Register, published in 1835. The plate nominally showed B. speciosa (Showy Banksia), but was subsequently identified by some as the then- unpublished B. victoriae. However, clearly it is an accurate representation of Banksia baxteri, which does grow alongside B. speciosa in part of its range. Plate 4906 from Curtis's Botanical Magazine, published in 1857. The first known specimens of B. victoriae may have been seeds sent to England in the early 1830s. These seeds were distributed to a number of gardens, and by 1835 three gardens had successfully raised plants to flowering: the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, the garden of George Percy, 5th Duke of Northumberland, and that of Henry Berens of Sidcup. In that year, the second of these was painted by Sarah Drake, and included as Plate 1728 in Edwards's Botanical Register. In the accompanying text, John Lindley identified the plant as B. speciosa (Showy Banksia), but commented \\"We found neither the whiteness of the under side of the leaves, nor the faintness of the veins, which are supposed to be characteristic of the species\\". Doubts were raised about the identity of the species in 1857, when Walter Hood Fitch painted B. victoriae based on a cut flower provided by David Moore of Glasnevin Botanical Garden. Fitch's painting appeared as Plate 4906 in Volume 82 of Curtis's Botanical Magazine, and was accompanied by the text: \\"There can, I think, be no doubt of its being the same with the B. speciosa above quoted in the Bot. Reg., but not the B. speciosa of Br. and Hook., Bot. Mag. t. 3052; and equally certain does it appear to be the B. Victori√¶ of Meisner.\\" Thus it was implied that 1835 plate was in fact B. victoriae, a suggestion that was supported by George Bentham in his treatment of the species in his 1870 Flora Australiensis. Despite this possible early collection, it would not be until 1850 or 1851 that James Drummond collected the plant material upon which would be based the formal publication of B. victoriae. He collected the species only once, probably from near the Hutt River, and his material was sent to England as part of Drummond's sixth collection. In 1855 Carl Meissner published a formal description of the species in Hooker's Journal of Botany and Kew Garden Miscellany, referring to it as \\"a noble species, very near B. speciosa, but easily distinguished by the segments of the leaves being larger, flat, not white underneath, nor scrobiculate above, etc.\\". He named it in honour of Queen Victoria; thus the full name for the species is Banksia victoriae Meisn. He appears to have been unaware of the 1835 plate that would later be attributed to B. victoriae. The common name is woolly orange banksia. =Infrageneric placement= Although Meissner did not proffer an infrageneric placement for B. victoriae in his 1855 publication of the species, he did so the following year in his chapter on the Proteaceae for A. P. de Candolle's Prodromus systematis naturalis regni vegetabilis. Under Meissner's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia, B. victoriae was placed in section Eubanksia, series Dryandroideae. This arrangement stood until 1870, which George Bentham published his arrangement, in which he placed the species in section Orthostylis. A major disruption to Banksia's taxonomic nomenclature occurred in 1890, when Otto Kuntze challenged Banksia L.f. on the grounds that Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst had precedence. He proposed to transfer all Banksia species to the new genus Sirmuellera, but this was rejected, and Sirmuellera victoriae (Meisn.) Kuntze is now considered a nomenclatural synonym of B. victoriae. Bentham's arrangement stood for over a century, before being superseded by Alex George's revision, published in his 1981 monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae). George placed the species in Banksia subgenus Banksia, section Banksia, series Crocinae. This placement was rejected by Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges in 1996; their arrangement, which was based on a cladistic analysis of morphological features, discarded Crocinae altogether, instead placing B. victoriae in series Banksia, subseries Cratistylis, alongside B. burdettii (Burdett's Banksia). However, George did not accept this revision, and overturned it in his 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia series. Under George's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia, B. victoriae placement may be summarised as follows: Typical shrubby habit :Genus Banksia ::Subgenus Banksia :::Section Banksia ::::Series Salicinae ::::Series Grandes ::::Series Banksia ::::Series Crocinae :::::B. prionotes \\\\- B. burdettii \\\\- B. hookeriana \\\\- B. victoriae ::::Series Prostratae ::::Series Cyrtostylis ::::Series Tetragonae ::::Series Bauerinae ::::Series Quercinae :::Section Coccinea :::Section Oncostylis ::Subgenus Isostylis Since 1998, Austin Mast has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae, which comprises Banksia and Dryandra. Mast's analysis strongly supports Thiele's placement of B. victoriae, finding it to fall within a clade with B. menziesii (Menzies' Banksia), B. burdettii, B. hookeriana (Hooker's Banksia) and B. prionotes (Acorn Banksia), all of which are members of Thiele and Ladiges' Cratistylis. Overall, the inferred phylogeny is very greatly different from George's arrangement, and provides compelling evidence for the paraphyly of Banksia with respect to Dryandra. Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of Banksia by transferring Dryandra into it, and publishing B. subg. Spathulatae for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons; thus they also redefined the autonym B. subg. Banksia as containing the species not having spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. victoriae is placed in B. subg. Banksia. Distribution and habitat Distribution of B. victoriae, shown on a map of Western Australia's biogeographic regions. B. victoriae occurs only within a fairly small areas between Northampton and the lower reaches of the Murchison River. Under Version 5.1 of the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA), this distribution fell entirely without the Geraldton Sandplains biogeographic region. However the boundary between the Geraldton Sandplains and Yalgoo biogeographic regions has been substantially redrawn for IBRA Version 6.1, and it is not clear from publicly available data whether the species should now be considered to occur also in the Yalgoo region. The species grows in deep yellow or pale red sand, amongst tall shrubland. It was previously thought to occur only from the coast, but during The Banksia Atlas project, a few specimens were found within just a few kilometres of the coast. Although restricted to a small area, it is quite common within this area, and is sometimes dominates the vegetation. Ecology Like most other Proteaceae, B. victoriae has proteoid roots, roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, thus allowing nutrient uptake in low-nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient native soils of Australia. The species lacks a lignotuber, so plants are killed by bushfire. However, it is adapted to release its aerial seed bank following a bushfire, and so regenerates rapidly. This behaviour, known as serotiny, makes B. victoriae dependent upon a suitable fire regime for successful regeneration. Other threats to the species include susceptibility to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, and the loss of flowers due to harvesting for the cut flower trade. However, it is not currently considered endangered, partly because a significant proportion of the population occur within the Kalbarri National Park; it has not been given a rating under Western Australia's Department of Environment and Conservation's Declared Rare and Priority Flora List. Cultivation With attractive, deep-green foliage and large, brightly coloured flower species that are held outside the canopy, B. victoriae is a popular garden plant. It requires a sunny aspect in well-drained soil, and is sensitive to frost. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 27 to 41 days to germinate. It is easy to propagate from seed, but rather difficult from cuttings. It grows quickly, and flowers in three to four years from seed. George recommends only light pruning, not below the green foliage. It is also very popular for cut flower production, not just because of its attractive foliage and flower spikes, but also because flower spikes occur terminally on a branch, allowing flowers to be cut with a stem.

It generally grows as a small shrub to 1.5 m (5 ft) high with fine narrow leaves, and is best known for its unusually coloured dark purple-violet inflorescences. The colour of the inflorescences, short leaves, and flattened follicles which are sticky when young, help identify this species from others in the field. It is found in low shrubland in southern regions of Western Australia from Esperance in the east to Narrogin in the west, growing exclusively in sandy soils. First described in 1927 by the West Australian botanist Charles Gardner, the species was at one stage considered a variety of B. sphaerocarpa. Although there are no recognised subspecies or varieties, both lignotuberous and nonlignotuberous forms exist for Banksia violacea. Wasps, ants and flies have been recorded visiting flower spikes. Banksia violacea is classified as Not Threatened under the Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia. Regarded as of little value to floriculture, it is rarely cultivated. Description alt=A shrubby fine-foliaged bush is part-backlit by sunlight. Banksia violacea grows as a shrub up to 1.5 m (5 ft) tall, with narrow leaves 1‚Äì2 cm (0.4‚Äì0.8 in) long and about 0.15 cm (0.06 in) wide. New growth occurs in summer, and flowering ranges from November to April with a peak in February, but can be irregular in timing. Flowers arise from typical Banksia \\"flower spikes\\", and the inflorescences are made up of hundreds of pairs of flowers densely packed in a spiral around a woody axis. Roughly spherical with a diameter of 2‚Äì3 cm (0.8‚Äì1.2 in), the flower spikes arise from lateral stems lie partly within the foliage. Unusually for Banksia species, the inflorescences are often violet in colour, ranging anywhere from a dark violet-black through various combinations of violet and greenish-yellow in less pigmented blooms. Each flower consists of a tubular perianth made up of four fused tepals, and one long wiry style. The styles are hooked rather than straight, and are initially trapped inside the upper perianth parts, but break free at anthesis. The old flowers gradually fade to brown. The fruiting structure or follicle is a stout woody \\"cone\\", with a hairy appearance caused by the persistence of old withered flower parts. These follicles are crowded around the globular spike (called an infructescence at this point) and are oval to rhomboid, although the crowding makes some irregularly shaped. They measure 1‚Äì2.5 cm (0.4‚Äì1 in) long, 0.6 cm (0.2 in) high and 0.8‚Äì2.2 cm (0.3‚Äì0.9 in) wide. They are quite flattened and lack a ridge along the valve line. When young, the follicles are greenish in colour and slightly sticky, and covered in fine white hairs, fading to tan or grey with age. They open with fire, releasing a winged wedge-shaped (cuneate) seed 2‚Äì2.5 cm (0.8‚Äì1 in) long. The mottled dark grey seed body is falcate (crescent-shaped) and measures 1.2‚Äì1.8 cm (0.5‚Äì0.7 in) long and 0.2‚Äì0.25 cm (0.1 in) wide, with a flattened dark brown wing 1.1‚Äì1.7 cm (0.4‚Äì0.5 in) wide. The woody separator has the same dimensions as the seed. The bright green cotyledon leaves of the seedlings are oblong to linear in shape and measure 1.5 cm (0.6 in) long by 0.3 cm (0.1 in) wide. The greenish red hypocotyl is hairy, as are the stems of young plants. The hairy seedling leaves are crowded and oppositely arranged. They measure 0.7‚Äì1.3 cm (0.2‚Äì0.5 in) in length and have recurved margins. Young plants often begin branching within their first year of life. Taxonomy alt=A roundish bloom made up of hundreds of golden flower buds growing The type specimen of Banksia violacea was collected by the West Australian botanist Charles Gardner on 14 December 1926 in the vicinity of Lake Grace. The following year, he published a description of the species in Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of Western Australia. He placed it in section Oncostylis of Bentham's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia, giving it the specific epithet violacea in reference to the violet flowers. Thus the full name of the species, with author citation, is Banksia violacea C.A.Gardner. Retrieved June 26, 2010 The species has been considered a variety of B. sphaerocarpa (Fox Banksia); this view was published by William Blackall in his 1954 How to know Western Australian wildflowers. He considered B. violacea to be a variety of B. sphaerocarpa with violet flowers. This description was an invalid publication, however, and a nomen nudum. In 1981 Alex George declared Banksia sphaerocarpa var. violacea Blackall a nomenclatural synonym of B. violacea. In George's 1981 arrangement, B. violacea was placed in subgenus Banksia because its inflorescence is a typical Banksia \\"flower spike\\"; section Oncostylis because of its hooked styles; and series Abietinae because its inflorescence is roughly spherical. It was placed in taxonomic sequence between B. incana (Hoary Banksia) and B. meisneri (Meissner's Banksia). In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published the results of a cladistic analysis of morphological characters of Banksia. They retained George's subgenera and many of his series, but discarded his sections. B. ser. Abietinae was found to be very nearly monophyletic and so it was retained. It further resolved into four subclades, so Thiele and Ladiges split it into four subseries. B. violacea appeared in the last of these: alt=a globular old flowerhead, now mostly made up of greenish developing seed pods This clade became the basis of B. subseries Longistyles, which Thiele defined as containing those taxa with very long and slender styles, smoothly convex perianth limbs without a costal ridge, and thickened margins. In accordance with their cladogram, their arrangement placed B. violacea first in taxonomic sequence, followed by B. laricina (Rose-fruited Banksia). However, Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement was not accepted by George, who, questioning the emphasis on cladistics, rejected most of their changes in his 1999 arrangement, restored B. series Abietinae to his broader 1981 definition, and abandoned all of Thiele and Ladiges' subseries. George commented that the species has no close relatives, being \\"loosely allied\\" to B. sphaerocarpa (Fox Banksia) and B. telmatiaea (Swamp Fox Banksia). Despite this, the sequence of the series was altered so that B. violacea fell between B. scabrella (Burma Road Banksia) and B. incana, and its placement in George's arrangement may be summarised as follows: alt=A globular old flowerhead, mostly made up of mature brown seed pods :Banksia ::B. subg. Banksia :::B. sect. Banksia (9 series, 50 species, 9 subspecies, 3 varieties) :::B. sect. Coccinea (1 species) :::B. sect. Oncostylis ::::B. ser.

Isostylis (3 species) Since 1998, an American botanist, Austin Mast, has been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is very greatly different from George's arrangement, and somewhat different from Thiele and Ladiges'. With respect to B. violacea, Mast's results agree with its placement near B. laricina and B. incana, placing it in a clade with these two species and B. sphaerocarpa var. dolichostyla (treated at species rank as B. dolichostyla). However, Thiele's B. subseries Longistyles appears to be polyphyletic, as do both definitions of B. ser. Abietinae‚Äîthat is, none form a natural grouping. alt=A round bloom of mixed purplish and greenish yellow flowers lies amid some short grey-green needle- like leaves Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement of Banksia by merging Dryandra into it, and publishing B. subgenus Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then B. violacea is placed in B. subgenus Spathulatae. Distribution and habitat alt=map of Western Australia with red area in the south of the state B. violacea occurs in southern regions of Western Australia, from Woodanilling to Esperance and as far north as Hyden. This distribution includes areas of the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions. Retrieved June 26, 2010 It favours white sandy soils, often overlying laterite, clay or quartzite. It usually grows among heath and shrublands, associated with mallee eucalypts and Banksia sphaerocarpa var. caesia. Banksia violacea is classified as Not Threatened under the 1950 Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia. Ecology Like most other Proteaceae, Banksia violacea has proteoid roots, roots with dense clusters of short lateral rootlets that form a mat in the soil just below the leaf litter. These enhance solubilisation of nutrients, thus allowing their uptake in low- nutrient soils such as the phosphorus-deficient soils of Australia. B. violacea is highly susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback. Banksia violacea is one of a small number of Banksia species that has both lignotuberous and non-lignotuberous populations. In both cases, plants are adapted to release their aerial seed bank following a bushfire, ensuring seedlings are established on clear and relatively fertile ground; however the possession of a lignotuber makes plants much less reliant on fire regime for population maintenance and regeneration, as maternal plants are not killed by bushfire, but resprout from below ground level. Lignotuberous plants generally occur among the north-eastern populations, in the vicinity of Woodanilling. An investigation into the biogeography of these plants failed to find any vegetative, climatic or other environmental factors associated with the possession of a lignotuber. Banksia flowerheads in general play host to a variety of birds, mammals and insects. Retrieved June 24, 2010. However, only wasps, ants and flies were recorded visiting flower spikes during observations for The Banksia Atlas in the mid-1980s. Cultivation Banksia violacea is rarely cultivated. It is a slow-growing plant that tends to become untidy with age, and generally does not flower until four to five years after sprouting from seed. Flowers are an unusual colour, but occur within the bush where they grow within and are usually obscured by foliage. It tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage, except for the variant with a lignotuber, which may be pruned heavily. George recommends a sunny position in light, sandy soil. Professor Margaret Bernard Sedgley of the Waite Institute suggests the species is of no value to floriculture, as the inflorescences are too small and obscured by the foliage, although she does add that the purple colour may be a worthwhile character to select for in plant breeding. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 50 days to germinate.

Gunther belonged to a noble Frankish family and, if we may believe the poet Sedulius Scottus (Carm. 68 sqq. in \\"Mon. German. Histor.\\", Poet√¶ Lat., III, 221 sqq.), was a man of great ability. He was consecrated Archbishop of Cologne on 22 April 850 (Annal. Col., ad an. 850). For a long time he refused to cede his suffragan Diocese of Bremen to St. Ansgar who, in order to facilitate his missionary labours, desired to unite it with his Archdiocese of Hamburg. The affair was finally settled (c. 860) by pope Nicholas I in favour of St. Ansgar, and Gunther reluctantly consented. Gunther, who had become archchaplain of King Lothair II, received an unenviable notoriety through his unjustifiable conduct in the divorce of this licentious king from his lawful wife Teutberga. At a synod held at Aachen in January, and another in February, 860, a few bishops and abbots, under the leadership of Gunther, compelled Teutberga to declare that before her marriage with the king she had been violated by her brother. Upon her compulsory confession the king was allowed to discard her and she was condemned to a convent. At a third synod held at Aachen in April, 862, Gunther and a few other Lorraine bishops allowed the king to marry his concubine Waldrada. Nicholas I sent two legates to investigate the case, but the king bribed them, and at a synod which they held in Metz, in June, 863, the divorce was approved. According to historian Baron Ernouf, Gunther was Waldrada's uncle and Thietgaud, Archbishop of Trier was her brother. Baron Ernouf (1858) Histoire de Waldrade, de Lother II et de leurs descendants, p. 5 Gunther and his tool Thietgaud, were bold enough to bring the acts of the synod to the pope and ask for his approval. The pope convened a synod in the Lateran in October, 863, at which the decision of the Synod of Metz was rejected, and Gunther and Thietgaud, who refused to submit, were excommunicated and deposed. The two archbishops drew up a calumnious document of seven chapters (reprinted in P. L., CXXI, 377-380) in which they accused the pope of having unjustly excommunicated them. They sent copies of the document to the pope, the rebellious Photius, patriarch of Constantinople, and to the bishops of Lorraine. The pope, however, did not waver even when Emperor Louis II appeared before Rome with an army for the purpose of forcing him to withdraw the ban of excommunication from the archbishops. Though excommunicated and deposed, Gunther returned to Cologne and performed ecclesiastical functions on Maundy Thursday, 864. When, however, the other bishops of Lorraine and King Lothair submitted to the pope, Gunther and Thietgaud appeared before the synod which the pope convened at Rome in November, 864, asking to be released from excommunication and restored to their sees, but they were unsuccessful. After the accession of pope Adrian II, Gunther and Thietgaud returned to Rome in 867. Thietgaud was now freed from the ban, but Gunther remained excommunicated until the summer of 869, when, after a public retraction (P. L., CXXI, 381), he was admitted by the pope to lay communion at Monte Cassino abbey. The See of Cologne had in 864 been given by Lothair to the subdeacon Hugh, a nephew of Charles the Bald. He was deposed in 866 and Gunther regained his see. Being under the ban, Gunther engaged his brother Hilduin of Cambrai to perform ecclesiastical functions in his place. After the death of Gunther's protector, Lothair II, Wilbert was elected Archbishop of Cologne (7 January, 870). Seeing that all efforts to regain his see would be useless, Gunther acknowledged the new archbishop and left Cologne for good. He died in 873.

During the reign of the Emperor Lothair (840‚Äì855), he was one of a colony of Irish teachers at Li√®ge. Sedulius is sometimes called Sedulius the Younger, to distinguish him from Coelius Sedulius (a 5th-century poet). The usual Irish form of the name is Siadhal, but he appears to have been called Suadbar.See D√°ibh√≠ √ì Cr√≥in√≠n', 'The Irish as Mediators of Antique Culture on the Continent', in Paul Leo Butzer and Dietrich Lohrmann (eds.), Science in Western and Eastern Civilization in Carolongian Times (Basel, Boston, and Berlin: Birkh√§user Verlag, 1993), 41‚Äì52 at 50‚Äì1. It is quite probable that towards the end of his days he went to Milan, following the example of his countryman, Dungal, who established a school at Pavia. When and where he died is unknown. Life In search of warmer land to accommodate their growing population, the Norse Vikings made their way into Ireland during the mid-ninth century. Those already occupying the land, Irish monks, were driven out of their monasteries by force. A monk by the name of Sedulius Scottus was among them, and his search for refuge led him to the city of Li√®ge. He went on to document this journey in one of his poems, Flamina Nos Boreae or A Great Wind- Enter Sedulius. While in Li√®ge, Sedulius Scottus is believed to have stayed with Bishop Hartgar, who would later be addressed in much of Sedulius' poetry. He would become so fond of Bishop Hartgar that after the man's death, Sedulius wrote a lament in his honour. Sedulius also wrote to other prominent figures of his time, including Empress Ermengarde, King Louis, and Charles the Bald. It appears from the manuscript records of the 9th century that there was a teacher at St. Lambert, Li√®ge, who was known as Sedulius Scotus, and was a scribe and a poet. In Li√®ge, there was a plague during Sedulius' stay, which he would document in his poem Contra Plagam. Between this event, and the return of the Norse Vikings to Li√®ge, several scholars such as George Whicher, author of The Goliard Poets, have assumed that Sedulius perished in Li√®ge. However, it is also generally accepted that Sedulius moved from Li√®ge to Milan later in his life, but no official date has been assigned to this move. This thought is attributed to the relationship developed between Sedulius and Archbishop Tado of Milan, for whom he wrote the poem Tado, Benigne Vide, or Easter's Greetings. Aside from Christian literature and Biblical commentary, Sedulius held a passion for alcoholic beverages, especially beer. Sedulius liked the drink so much that he even wrote a lament to a small drought titled Nunc Viridant Segetes, or Drought in Spring. The poem ends with the line \\"Muse, ask our good father bishop: when do we drink again?\\" Works Sedulius's most important works are his treatise De Rectoribus Christianis, a commentary on Porphyry's Isagoge, or introduction to the logic of Aristotle, and a scriptural commentary Collectanea in omnes beati Pauli Epistolas. The first of these is a noteworthy contribution to Christian ethics. It is the first, apparently, of a long line of treatises written during the Middle Ages for the instruction of Christian princes and rulers, a dissertation on the duties peculiar to that state of life, a Mirror for Princes, as such works came to be called at a much later period. While in Li√®ge, Sedulius Scottus expanded his influence. He would later be known as the top literary figure in the city between 848 and 858, although the dates vary in regards to when his fame eventually settled. Sedulius Scottus was very interested in the spiritual formation of the royal leaders, asserting that they should possess knowledge to lead both clergy and council. To accomplish this, he wrote De rectoribus Christianis, or On Christian Rulers, for Emperor Lothar I's son, Lothar II. This was designed to be an aid in his princely duties, and fit into a popular category of literature, the Mirror for Princes. In this document, Sedulius highlighted eight pillars that he hoped all Christian rulers would abide by, and used both Theodosius I and Constantine as role models for aspiring Christian leaders. He also mentioned King David among the inspirational figures, commenting that even with sin, David still led the nation towards God. Sedulius's work shows, among other traits, a deep moral feeling, a realisation of the fact that the mission of the state is neither purely economic on the one hand nor exclusively ecclesiastical, on the other. The question of the relations between Church and State had, indeed, been raised, and Sedulius affirms the rights of the Church, to defend them. He is not on the side of those who, seeing in Charlemagne the ideal of a pontiff and ruler in one person, were in favour of the idea that the prince should, in fact, be supreme in matters religious. On the contrary, he is in favour of a division of temporal and spiritual powers and requires of the prince a careful observance of the Church's rights and privileges. The description of the qualifications of the QueenHellmann, pp. 34 sq. is not only Christian in feeling and tone, but also humanistic, in the best sense of the word. Among his work, a mock epic is preserved known as De Quodam Verbece a Cane Discerpto or in English, \\"On a Ram Torn to Pieces by a Dog\\". This was intended to be a paradoxical account of Aeneid, a contender to the Gospel accounts of Jesus Christ. His hope was to create a Christian hero in a time where most epics were written about figures that did not subscribe to the Christian doctrine. Sedulius is thought to have held his own copy of the Aeneid, potentially sharing notes in the margins of the document that he made with the addition of comments made by Donatus on Virgil. The commentary on the Isagoge was known in Western Europe in the Latin version only. Not the least interesting of the writings of Sedulius are his letters, some of which are published in the \\"Neues Archiv\\", II, 188, and IV, 315. In them are narrated the vicissitudes of the Irish exiles on the Continent, and an insight is given into the attitude towards those exiles by the authorities, civil and ecclesiastical, as well as by the people. Sedulius, also known as John Scottus, was bilingual, speaking both Greek and Latin. This skill allowed him to translate a number of documents, most famously Greek Psalters. It is suggested by several sources that Sedulius may even have had an entire Bible translated for or by himself. He was a student of Greek, and, according to Bernard de Montfaucon, it was he who copied the Greek Psalter (now no. 8047 in the \\"Biblioth√®que de l'Arsenal\\", Paris). His poems, to the number of ninety, are published by Traube in the Poetae Aevi Carolini, which is a portion of the Monumenta Germaniae Historica. As of now, there is only one full commentary on the Carmina by Sedulius Scottus, done by R. Duchting. =List of Works= * Flamina Nos Boreae (A Great Wind-Enter Sedulius) * De rectoribus Christianis (On Christian Rulers) * De Quodam Verbece a Cane Discerpto (On a Ram Torn to Pieces by a Dog) * Contra Plagam (Intercession Against the Plague) * Collectaneum in Mattheum (Commentary on the Gospel of Matthew) * De certamine liliae et rosae (Debate between a Lily and a Rose.) * Nunc Viridant Segetes (Drought in Spring) * Nos Sitis Atque Fames (Small Beer) * Aut Lego Vel Scribo (A Scholar's Life) * Collectaneum in omnes beati Pauli epistolas * The Standing Corn is Green \\"The Scholars of Clonard\\" The poem, \\"The Scholars of Clonard\\", is attributed to Sedulius: :Look on the marble columns surpassing the stars, :which the sand of the saint-bearing land supports here :happy, famous Ailer√°n, Vinnau, Fergus, :shining lights made by gift-carrying God. :O He sent a great present of Scotia [i.e.Ireland], :rich relics which Pictonia [i.e. Poitiers] wishes to be its own, :whence comes Titan and where night established the stars :and where midday is hot with blazing hours :[i.e. the east and the west and the south].

The screenplay by Karen Janszen focuses on the friendship forged between a precocious pre-teen girl with a vivid imagination and a man with developmental disabilities. Plot Set in the mid-1960s, the story centers on ten-year-old Harriet Frankovitz, a lonely outcast who lives with her mother and older sister Gwen in a dilapidated North Carolina motel with cabins shaped like teepees her mother received as part of her divorce settlement. Harriet has a strong desire to escape her dull existence by means of any one of a number of creative ways - a magic carpet she tries to fly off the roof, on board a flying saucer she anxiously awaits in the schoolyard, through a tunnel she has been digging to China, or by attaching helium-filled balloons to a lawn chair. Mrs. Frankovitz is a bitter alcoholic with a propensity for driving on the wrong side of the road, while promiscuous Gwen entertains a series of men in vacant rooms. Terminally ill Leah Schroth is en route to an institution where she plans to admit her mentally challenged son Ricky when their car breaks down near the motel, and the two stay there while waiting for the vehicle to be repaired. Mrs. Frankovitz is killed in an automobile accident, and Harriet discovers Gwen is her biological mother. The distressed girl and her new friend run away and set up house in an abandoned caboose concealed beneath dense foliage in the woods. When Ricky becomes ill, Harriet is forced to seek medical assistance for him. Once he recovers, his mother sets off with him to complete their interrupted journey, leaving Gwen and Harriet to learn to interact in their new roles of mother and daughter. Production notes The film was shot in Cherokee, North Carolina. The soundtrack includes \\"One Big Love\\" by Patty Griffin, \\"Last Train to Clarksville\\" by The Monkees, \\"Mas Que Nada\\" by S√©rgio Mendez and Brazil '66, \\"Iko Iko\\" by The Dixie Cups, \\"Soul Sauce\\" by Cal Tjader, \\"Crimson and Clover\\" by Tommy James and the Shondells, \\"El Lobo\\" by Herb Alpert, \\"Samba Pa Ti\\" by Carlos Santana, and \\"Magic Carpet Ride\\" by Steppenwolf.

Principal cast *Evan Rachel Wood as Harriet Frankovitz *Kevin Bacon as Ricky Schroth *Mary Stuart Masterson as Gwen Frankovitz *Marian Seldes as Leah Schroth *Cathy Moriarty as Mrs. Frankovitz Critical reception In his review in The New York Times, Stephen Holden said the film \\"doesn't grab at the heartstrings and strum an aggressively mawkish ballad. In fact, it could do with a bit more heart. Part of the problem is Ms. Wood's Harriet. The young actress is radiantly photogenic, but her performance is muted and monochromatic ... Without an incandescent performance at its center, Digging to China follows the same path as Harriet's balloon escape. It gets stuck in the trees.\\"The New York Times review Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle called it a \\"cloying, superficial story [that] ends up forced and predictable ... Bacon's portrayal of Ricky, who is disabled by a nerve disease that contorts his body and face, ranges from adequate to almost touching. But it's the desperate, contrived storytelling that makes the film a chore to watch ... [its] saving grace is that it's lush and visually attractive.\\"San Francisco Chronicle review In the San Francisco Examiner, Walter Addiego described it as \\"an uneasy mixture of afterschool special and art-house project\\" and \\"well-intentioned but ultimately sentimental\\" and added, \\"It nonetheless offers some good performances and nice, low-key observations about the predicament of outsiders ... Considering the material, Hutton should be commended. There's just enough going on in Digging to China to suggest real directorial talent, and I hope he can build on this foundation.\\"San Francisco Examiner review Awards and nominations Kevin Bacon was named Best Actor at the Giffoni Film Festival, and the film won the Children's Jury Award at the Chicago International Children's Film Festival.

The first African American U.S. Marines were trained at Camp Montford Point, in Jacksonville, North Carolina, from 1942 to 1949. The association's stated creed is: > To promote and preserve the strong bonds of friendship born from shared > adversities and to devote ourselves to the furtherance of these > accomplishments to ensure more peaceful times. The organization supports educational assistance programs, veterans programs, and community services, with an emphasis on improving the social conditions of the growing population of military veterans who are disabled or senior citizens. Membership in the nonprofit organization is open to veterans and active members of all branches of the U.S. Armed Forces regardless of race, creed, or national origin. The MPMA also hosts the MPMA Ladies Auxiliary. Membership in the Ladies Auxiliary is open to wives, daughters, sisters, and mothers of members or former members of the United States Armed Forces. History of Camp Montford Point Reuben J. McNair, Sr., and a fellow veteran of the Montford Point Marine Association, converses with a present-day African American Marine officer. Montford Point Marines were guests of honor at Marine Barracks Washington in August 2011, bringing their story to the national forefront. On June 28, 2012, they were awarded replicas of a Congressional Gold Medal during a presentation ceremony at the historic parade grounds. In 1940 while the United States prepared for war, millions of jobs in the defense industry were being created. Blacks seeking jobs in the growing defense industries suffered violence and discrimination. Many black leaders, including A. Philip Randolph, president of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and the most widely known spokesperson for black working-class interests in the United States, met with Franklin D. Roosevelt and his administration to demand that he sign an executive order banning discrimination against black workers in the defense industry. Randolph threatened to bring tens of thousands of marchers to Washington, D.C. On June 25, 1941, days before the march was to occur, Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802, which barred government agencies and federal contractors from refusing employment in industries engaged in defense production on the basis of race, creed, color, or national origin. It was the first Presidential decree issued on race since Reconstruction. The order required the armed services, including the Marine Corps, to recruit and enlist African Americans Recruiting for the \\"Montford Marines\\" began on June 1, 1942. Thousands of African American men, eager to serve, flocked to recruiting offices. However, several recruitment offices wanted to claim the honor of having the first recruit, and on May 31, 1942 when a recruitment officer happened to be on the same City Hall elevator in downtown Oklahoma City with a young man wearing a Langston College sweater, he asked him if he would like to be the first Black Marine. That young man was Alfred Masters. At the time, Mr. Masters was twenty-six years old, had one daughter, Shirley Jean, and married to Isabell Arch. He was sworn into the Marine Corp on June 1, 1942 at 12:00 midnight with his wife by his side. Alfred Masters rose to the rank of Technical Sergeant. The first black recruits received basic training at the segregated Camp Montford Point in Jacksonville, North Carolina. The 1,200 men in the quota were housed in prefabricated huts. Racism continued in the Marine Corps after the issuance of Executive Order 9981, reflecting that in the society. Railroad tracks divided white residents from the camp for African American troops, and the black recruits were not allowed to enter the main base of nearby Camp Lejeune unless accompanied by a white Marine. By 1945, all drill instructors and many NCOs at Montford Point were African Americans. Between 1942 and 1949, more than 20,000 men were trained at Montford Point. In July 1948, despite strong opposition from Democrats of the segregated South, President Harry S. Truman signed Executive Order 9981, which required the desegregation of the military. In 1949 Montford Point was deactivated, and new black recruits were sent to Parris Island and Camp Pendleton. During the Korean War, the United States Marine Corps fully integrated. In 1965, a reunion of Marines was held in Philadelphia which included former Montford Point Marines along with Marines on active duty. With more than 400 Marines from throughout the United States gathered, they decided to establish the Montford Point Marine Association as a nonprofit veterans organization, to preserve military history and help people in need. The association has many chapters, and is a member of the Marine Corps Council, a council of Marine-related service groups. The Montford Point Marine Association maintains archives, and the Montford Point Marines Museum at Camp Gilbert H. Johnson, Jacksonville, North Carolina. It holds an annual convention to celebrate the Montford Point Marines, make organizational decisions, and distribute scholarships.

Situated at the mouth of Lumaha ªi River, is accessed along Hawaii Route 56 between Hanalei and Ha ªena State Park. Due to strong waves, currents and undertow, the beach and bay are considered unsafe for swimming and surfing most of the year. Bread fruit trees are said to have been planted here by a Menehune named Weli. Lumaha ªi Beach was featured in the 1958 film South Pacific. Geography Lumaha'i is a picturesque beach along the northern shores of Kauai, and is formed at the mouth of the Lumaha'i River which joins the Pacific Ocean. It is accessed from Hawaii Route 56, some from Hanalei. Many trails emerge from the highway, which provide access to Kahalahala, the eastern end of the beach. However, the western end of the beach is accessed from an iron wood forest parking lot along the river. The wide, sloping beach measures about in length, and is set against the backdrop of vertical cliffs of volcanic rocks, which have lush vegetation. The sand formation consists of olivine, a mineral consisting of the chemical composition of iron, magnesium, and silica, which renders yellowish green colour to the beach. The beach has rocky features and lava rocks at the mouth of the Lumaha'i River, which results in treacherous rip currents. As there are no reefs in the coast line, the surf is very high and strong, and sea waves are a continuous feature on the beach. The beach plays a vital role in maintaining productivity of the estuary environment in that the features of the beach undergo changes during the year from summer to winter and during the spring season. During summer, sand dunes block the western end of the beach, creating a temporary barrier for the flow of the river into the sea and thus stabilizing the nature of the estuary. During winter and spring seasons, due to the effect of the waves and wind, the beach sand shifts drastically to the opposite eastern end of the beach. This causes a substantial reduction in the width of the beach and, combined with floods during the rainy months of spring and winter, the river flow into the ocean is restored. This phenomenon results in migration of ‚Äòo‚Äôopu larvae (Stenogobius hawaiiensis) in large numbers, which over the next few months, as they mature, move into the estuary where they get re- acclimatized and then move upstream along the river. On account of the seasonal variations, the width of the beach changes by . During heavy rainfall in winter and spring, the beach is prone to flooding. Because of flash floods, a phone has been installed at the beach to issue safety warnings. Vegetation Breadfruit tree There are three notable species of trees near the beach at the mouth of the river: the hibiscus of Maihi, the breadfruit of Weli and the pendanus of Mapuana. The pendanus of Mapuana near the beach, with the local name Kahala-o-Mapuana, unusually yielded red fruits instead of yellow and is noted for its scented smell. According to Hawaiian legend, the hibiscus of Maihi is a grove which was planted by a Menehune called Maihi-lau- koa, and the breadfruit of Weli is named after Weli, a Menehune. The Weli tree yields large fruits with plenty of pulp. Due to the tree spreading its branches to the ground, a popular verse: \\"Na'ulu -o-Weli punohu mai ana\\" meaning, \\"The breadfruit trees of Weli spread out their low branches like clouds\\" was written about it. Public use In the absence of a protective reef, Lumaha‚Äôi is directly exposed to powerful ocean currents. Multiple drownings have occurred at Lumaha‚Äôi; the beach is never safe for swimming or other water activities. Specialist bodyboarders and surfers surf on the shorebreak, particularly on the eastern side of the beach where the river joins the ocean. Because of its scenic beauty with the back drop of volcanic rock cliffs and the Pacific Ocean in the foreground, the beach is a popular landscape setting among painters and for commercial photos. The beach was used in the 1958 World War II romantic movie South Pacific where a scene depicted Mitzi Gaynor singing ‚ÄúI'm Going to Wash that Man Right out of my Hair\\". In the movie, the nurses' quarters were set on Lumaha'i Beach but signed as \\"Nurses‚Äô Beach\\".

These black box processes can be reconnected endlessly to form different applications without having to be changed internally. FBP is thus naturally component-oriented. FBP is a particular form of dataflow programming based on bounded buffers, information packets with defined lifetimes, named ports, and separate definition of connections.  Introduction  Flow-based programming defines applications using the metaphor of a \\"data factory\\". It views an application not as a single, sequential process, which starts at a point in time, and then does one thing at a time until it is finished, but as a network of asynchronous processes communicating by means of streams of structured data chunks, called \\"information packets\\" (IPs). In this view, the focus is on the application data and the transformations applied to it to produce the desired outputs. The network is defined externally to the processes, as a list of connections which is interpreted by a piece of software, usually called the \\"scheduler\\". The processes communicate by means of fixed-capacity connections. A connection is attached to a process by means of a port, which has a name agreed upon between the process code and the network definition. More than one process can execute the same piece of code. At any point in time, a given IP can only be \\"owned\\" by a single process, or be in transit between two processes. Ports may either be simple, or array-type, as used e.g. for the input port of the Collate component described below. It is the combination of ports with asynchronous processes that allows many long-running primitive functions of data processing, such as Sort, Merge, Summarize, etc., to be supported in the form of software black boxes. Because FBP processes can continue executing as long they have data to work on and somewhere to put their output, FBP applications generally run in less elapsed time than conventional programs, and make optimal use of all the processors on a machine, with no special programming required to achieve this. The network definition is usually diagrammatic, and is converted into a connection list in some lower-level language or notation. FBP is often a visual programming language at this level. More complex network definitions have a hierarchical structure, being built up from subnets with \\"sticky\\" connections. Many other flow-based languages/runtimes are built around more traditional programming languages, the most notable example is RaftLib which uses C++ iostream-like operators to specify the flow graph. FBP has much in common with the Linda language in that it is, in Gelernter and Carriero's terminology, a \\"coordination language\\": it is essentially language-independent. Indeed, given a scheduler written in a sufficiently low-level language, components written in different languages can be linked together in a single network. FBP thus lends itself to the concept of domain-specific languages or \\"mini-languages\\". FBP exhibits \\"data coupling\\", described in the article on coupling as the loosest type of coupling between components. The concept of loose coupling is in turn related to that of service-oriented architectures, and FBP fits a number of the criteria for such an architecture, albeit at a more fine-grained level than most examples of this architecture. FBP promotes high-level, functional style of specifications that simplify reasoning about system behavior. An example of this is the distributed data flow model for constructively specifying and analyzing the semantics of distributed multi- party protocols.  History  Flow-Based Programming was invented by J. Paul Morrison in the early 1970s, and initially implemented in software for a Canadian bank. FBP at its inception was strongly influenced by some IBM simulation languages of the period, in particular GPSS, but its roots go all the way back to Conway's seminal paper on what he called coroutines. FBP has undergone a number of name changes over the years: the original implementation was called AMPS (Advanced Modular Processing System). One large application in Canada went live in 1975, and, as of 2013, has been in continuous production use, running daily, for almost 40 years. Because IBM considered the ideas behind FBP \\"too much like a law of nature\\" to be patentable they instead put the basic concepts of FBP into the public domain, by means of a Technical Disclosure Bulletin, \\"Data Responsive Modular, Interleaved Task Programming System\\",J. Paul Morrison, Data Responsive Modular, Interleaved Task Programming System, IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin, Vol. 13, No. 8, 2425-2426, January 1971 in 1971. An article describing its concepts and experience using it was published in 1978 in the IBM Research IBM Systems Journal under the name DSLM. A second implementation was done as a joint project of IBM Canada and IBM Japan, under the name \\"Data Flow Development Manager\\" (DFDM), and was briefly marketed in Japan in the late '80s under the name \\"Data Flow Programming Manager\\". Generally the concepts were referred to within IBM as \\"Data Flow\\", but this term was felt to be too general, and eventually the name \\"Flow-Based Programming\\" was adopted. From the early '80s to 1993 J. Paul Morrison and IBM architect Wayne Stevens refined and promoted the concepts behind FBP. Stevens wrote several articles describing and supporting the FBP concept, and included material about it in several of his books.W.P. Stevens, Using Data Flow for Application Development, Byte, June 1985W.P. Stevens, Software Design - Concepts and Methods, Practical Software Engineering Series, Ed. Allen Macro, Prentice Hall, 1990, . In 1994 Morrison published a book describing FBP, and providing empirical evidence that FBP led to reduced development times.  Concepts  The following diagram shows the major entities of an FBP diagram (apart from the Information Packets). Such a diagram can be converted directly into a list of connections, which can then be executed by an appropriate engine (software or hardware). Simple FBP diagram A, B and C are processes executing code components. O1, O2, and the two INs are ports connecting the connections M and N to their respective processes. It is permitted for processes B and C to be executing the same code, so each process must have its own set of working storage, control blocks, etc. Whether or not they do share code, B and C are free to use the same port names, as port names only have meaning within the components referencing them (and at the network level, of course). M and N are what are often referred to as \\"bounded buffers\\", and have a fixed capacity in terms of the number of IPs that they can hold at any point in time. The concept of ports is what allows the same component to be used at more than one place in the network. In combination with a parametrization ability, called Initial Information Packets (IIPs), ports provide FBP with a component reuse ability, making FBP a component-based architecture. FBP thus exhibits what Raoul de Campo and Nate Edwards of IBM Research have termed configurable modularity. Information Packets or IPs are allocated in what might be called \\"IP space\\" (just as Linda's tuples are allocated in \\"tuple space\\"), and have a well- defined lifetime until they are disposed of and their space is reclaimed - in FBP this must be an explicit action on the part of an owning process. IPs traveling across a given connection (actually it is their \\"handles\\" that travel) constitute a \\"stream\\", which is generated and consumed asynchronously - this concept thus has similarities to the lazy cons concept described in the 1976 article by Friedman and Wise.D.P. Friedman and D.S. Wise, CONS should not evaluate its arguments, Automata, Languages and Programming, Edinburgh University Press, Edinburgh, 1976 IPs are usually structured chunks of data - some IPs, however, may not contain any real data, but are used simply as signals. An example of this is \\"bracket IPs\\", which can be used to group data IPs into sequential patterns within a stream, called \\"substreams\\". Substreams may in turn be nested. IPs may also be chained together to form \\"IP trees\\", which travel through the network as single objects. The system of connections and processes described above can be \\"ramified\\" to any size. During the development of an application, monitoring processes may be added between pairs of processes, processes may be \\"exploded\\" to subnets, or simulations of processes may be replaced by the real process logic. FBP therefore lends itself to rapid prototyping. This is really an assembly line image of data processing: the IPs travelling through a network of processes may be thought of as widgets travelling from station to station in an assembly line. \\"Machines\\" may easily be reconnected, taken off line for repair, replaced, and so on. Oddly enough, this image is very similar to that of unit record equipment that was used to process data before the days of computers, except that decks of cards had to be hand-carried from one machine to another. Implementations of FBP may be non-preemptive or preemptive - the earlier implementations tended to be non-preemptive (mainframe and C language), whereas the latest Java implementation (see below) uses Java Thread class and is preemptive.  Examples  = \\"Telegram Problem\\" = FBP components often form complementary pairs. This example uses two such pairs. The problem described seems very simple as described in words, but in fact is surprisingly difficult to accomplish using conventional procedural logic. The task, called the \\"Telegram Problem\\", originally described by Peter Naur, is to write a program which accepts lines of text and generates output lines containing as many words as possible, where the number of characters in each line does not exceed a certain length. The words may not be split and we assume no word is longer than the size of the output lines. This is analogous to the word- wrapping problem in text editors. In conventional logic, the programmer rapidly discovers that neither the input nor the output structures can be used to drive the call hierarchy of control flow. In FBP, on the other hand, the problem description itself suggests a solution: * \\"words\\" are mentioned explicitly in the description of the problem, so it is reasonable for the designer to treat words as information packets (IPs) * in FBP there is no single call hierarchy, so the programmer is not tempted to force a sub-pattern of the solution to be the top level. Here is the most natural solution in FBP (there is no single \\"correct\\" solution in FBP, but this seems like a natural fit): Peter Naur's \\"Telegram problem\\" where DC and RC stand for \\"DeCompose\\" and \\"ReCompose\\", respectively. As mentioned above, Initial Information Packets (IIPs) can be used to specify parametric information such as the desired output record length (required by the rightmost two components), or file names. IIPs are data chunks associated with a port in the network definition which become \\"normal\\" IPs when a \\"receive\\" is issued for the relevant port. = Batch update = This type of program involves passing a file of \\"details\\" (changes, adds and deletes) against a \\"master file\\", and producing (at least) an updated master file, and one or more reports. Update programs are generally quite hard to code using synchronous, procedural code, as two (sometimes more) input streams have to be kept synchronized, even though there may be masters without corresponding details, or vice versa. Canonical \\"batch update\\" structure In FBP, a reusable component (Collate), based on the unit record idea of a Collator, makes writing this type of application much easier as Collate merges the two streams and inserts bracket IPs to indicate grouping levels, significantly simplifying the downstream logic. Suppose that one stream (\\"masters\\" in this case) consists of IPs with key values of 1, 2 and 3, and the second stream IPs (\\"details\\") have key values of 11, 12, 21, 31, 32, 33 and 41, where the first digit corresponds to the master key values. Using bracket characters to represent \\"bracket\\" IPs, the collated output stream will be as follows: ( m1 d11 d12 ) ( m2 d21 ) ( m3 d31 d32 d33 ) (d41) As there was no master with a value of 4, the last group consists of a single detail (plus brackets). The structure of the above stream can be described succinctly using a BNF-like notation such as { ( [m] d* ) }* Collate is a reusable black box which only needs to know where the control fields are in its incoming IPs (even this is not strictly necessary as transformer processes can be inserted upstream to place the control fields in standard locations), and can in fact be generalized to any number of input streams, and any depth of bracket nesting. Collate uses an array-type port for input, allowing a variable number of input streams. = Multiplexing processes = Flow-based programming supports process multiplexing in a very natural way. Since components are read-only, any number of instances of a given component (\\"processes\\") can run asynchronously with each other. Example of multiplexing When computers usually had a single processor, this was useful when a lot of I/O was going on; now that machines usually have multiple processors, this is starting to become useful when processes are CPU-intensive as well. The diagram in this section shows a single \\"Load Balancer\\" process distributing data between 3 processes, labeled S1, S2 and S3, respectively, which are instances of a single component, which in turn feed into a single process on a \\"first-come, first served\\" basis. = Simple interactive network = Schematic of general interactive application In this general schematic, requests (transactions) coming from users enter the diagram at the upper left, and responses are returned at the lower left. The \\"back ends\\" (on the right side) communicate with systems at other sites, e.g. using CORBA, MQSeries, etc. The cross- connections represent requests that do not need to go to the back ends, or requests that have to cycle through the network more than once before being returned to the user. As different requests may use different back-ends, and may require differing amounts of time for the back-ends (if used) to process them, provision must be made to relate returned data to the appropriate requesting transactions, e.g. hash tables or caches. The above diagram is schematic in the sense that the final application may contain many more processes: processes may be inserted between other processes to manage caches, display connection traffic, monitor throughput, etc. Also the blocks in the diagram may represent \\"subnets\\" - small networks with one or more open connections.  Comparison with other paradigms and methodologies  = Jackson Structured Programming (JSP) and Jackson System Development (JSD) = This methodology assumes that a program must be structured as a single procedural hierarchy of subroutines. Its starting point is to describe the application as a set of \\"main lines\\", based on the input and output data structures. One of these \\"main lines\\" is then chosen to drive the whole program, and the others are required to be \\"inverted\\" to turn them into subroutines (hence the name \\"Jackson inversion\\"). This sometimes results in what is called a \\"clash\\", requiring the program to be split into multiple programs or coroutines. When using FBP, this inversion process is not required, as every FBP component can be considered a separate \\"main line\\". FBP and JSP share the concept of treating a program (or some components) as a parser of an input stream. In Jackson's later work, Jackson System Development (JSD), the ideas were developed further.\\"Programming\\" by M. A. Jackson, published in Proceedings of Workshop on Software in High-Energy Physics, pages 1-12, CERN, Geneva, 4‚Äì6 October 1982\\"A System development method \\" by M. A. Jackson, published in Tools and notions for program construction: An advanced course, Cambridge University Press, 1982 In JSD the design is maintained as a network design until the final implementation stage. The model is then transformed into a set of sequential processes to the number of available processors. Jackson discusses the possibility of directly executing the network model that exists prior to this step, in section 1.3 of his book (italics added): :The specification produced at the end of the System Timing step is, in principle, capable of direct execution. The necessary environment would contain a processor for each process, a device equivalent to an unbounded buffer for each data stream, and some input and output devices where the system is connected to the real world. Such an environment could, of course, be provided by suitable software running on a sufficiently powerful machine. Sometimes, such direct execution of the specification will be possible, and may even be a reasonable choice. FBP was recognized by M A Jackson as an approach that follows his method of \\"Program decomposition into sequential processes communicating by a coroutine-like mechanism\\"\\"JSP In Perspective\\" Michael Jackson; JSP in Perspective; in Software Pioneers: Contributions to Software Engineering; Manfred Broy, Ernst Denert eds; Springer, 2002 = Applicative programming = W.B. Ackerman defines an applicative language as one which does all of its processing by means of operators applied to values.W.B. Ackerman, Data Flow Languages, Proceedings National Computer Conference, pp. 1087-1095, 1979 The earliest known applicative language was LISP. An FBP component can be regarded as a function transforming its input stream(s) into its output stream(s). These functions are then combined to make more complex transformations, as shown here: Two functions feeding one If we label streams, as shown, with lower case letters, then the above diagram can be represented succinctly as follows: c = G(F(a),F(b)); Just as in functional notation F can be used twice because it only works with values, and therefore has no side effects, in FBP two instances of a given component may be running concurrently with each other, and therefore FBP components must not have side-effects either. Functional notation could clearly be used to represent at least a part of an FBP network. The question then arises whether FBP components can themselves be expressed using functional notation. W.H. Burge showed how stream expressions can be developed using a recursive, applicative style of programming, but this work was in terms of (streams of) atomic values.W.H. Burge, Recursive Programming Techniques, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, 1975 In FBP, it is necessary to be able to describe and process structured data chunks (FBP IPs). Furthermore, most applicative systems assume that all the data is available in memory at the same time, whereas FBP applications need to be able to process long- running streams of data while still using finite resources. Friedman and Wise suggested a way to do this by adding the concept of \\"lazy cons\\" to Burge's work. This removed the requirement that both of the arguments of \\"cons\\" be available at the same instant of time. \\"Lazy cons\\" does not actually build a stream until both of its arguments are realized - before that it simply records a \\"promise\\" to do this. This allows a stream to be dynamically realized from the front, but with an unrealized back end. The end of the stream stays unrealized until the very end of the process, while the beginning is an ever-lengthening sequence of items. = Linda = Many of the concepts in FBP seem to have been discovered independently in different systems over the years. Linda, mentioned above, is one such. The difference between the two techniques is illustrated by the Linda \\"school of piranhas\\" load balancing technique - in FBP, this requires an extra \\"load balancer\\" component which routes requests to the component in a list which has the smallest number of IPs waiting to be processed. Clearly FBP and Linda are closely related, and one could easily be used to simulate the other. = Object-oriented programming = An object in OOP can be described as a semi-autonomous unit comprising both information and behaviour. Objects communicate by means of \\"method calls\\", which are essentially subroutine calls, done indirectly via the class to which the receiving object belongs. The object's internal data can only be accessed by means of method calls, so this is a form of information hiding or \\"encapsulation\\". Encapsulation, however, predates OOP - David Parnas wrote one of the seminal articles on it in the early 70s \\\\- and is a basic concept in computing. Encapsulation is the very essence of an FBP component, which may be thought of as a black box, performing some conversion of its input data into its output data. In FBP, part of the specification of a component is the data formats and stream structures that it can accept, and those it will generate. This constitutes a form of design by contract. In addition, the data in an IP can only be accessed directly by the currently owning process. Encapsulation can also be implemented at the network level, by having outer processes protect inner ones. A paper by C. Ellis and S. Gibbs distinguishes between active objects and passive objects.C. Ellis and S. Gibbs, Active Objects: Realities and Possibilities, in Object-Oriented Concepts, Databases, and Applications, eds. W. Kim and F.H. Lochovsky, ACM Press, Addison-Wesley, 1989 Passive objects comprise information and behaviour, as stated above, but they cannot determine the timing of this behaviour. Active objects on the other hand can do this. In their article Ellis and Gibbs state that active objects have much more potential for the development of maintainable systems than do passive objects. An FBP application can be viewed as a combination of these two types of object, where FBP processes would correspond to active objects, while IPs would correspond to passive objects. = Actor model = FBP considers Carl Hewitt's Actor as an asynchronous processes with 2 ports: one for input messages and one for control signals. A control signal is emitted by the actor itself after each round of execution. The purpose of this signal is to avoid parallel execution of the actor's body and so to allow to access the fields of the actor object without synchronization.

Plot In 1892 Horace Lamb lives on an inherited estate with his wife, their five children, his extended family and a slew of servants including the butler Bullivant. Though Horace is wealthy through his marriage to Charlotte he insists on controlling her money in a miserly way. The ones who suffer the most from his economy are his children (in particular his eldest Sarah) who dress in rags and are constantly cold and hungry. Charlotte and Horace's cousin Mortimer, who is his dependent, plan to run away together. Before this can be accomplished Charlotte is called to visit her ailing father. The children are taught by their great-aunt Emilia, however Horace is eventually persuaded to hire a tutor, Gideon Doubleday, for the elder children. After Gideon takes a casual invitation from Horace seriously he decides to return the favour by asking the Lambs to meet his mother, Gertrude, and sister, Magdalen. Gertrude takes an immediate interest in Horace while Magdalen develops feelings for Mortimer. The two families grow closer in Charlotte's absence and Gertrude hints to Horace that her daughter and Mortimer might marry some day which he finds appalling. Charlotte abruptly returns and discovers her children well-clothed and fed and her husband repentant. Horace claims to have seen the error in his ways but reveals he is aware of the plot between Charlotte and Mortimer. Charlotte decides to stay with Horace, despite no longer loving him, in order to maintain family harmony. Horace reveals that he will only continue to pay for Mortimer if he marries Magdalen and moves elsewhere. With no other options Mortimer ascents. Mortimer discovers however that an intimate letter of Charlotte's that she sent to a letter drop-off run by a Miss Buchanan has gone astray. He learns that it was accidentally collected by Gertrude who gave it to Magdalen to return. Acting in her own interest Magdalen instead opened the letter and then dropped it in the Lamb household in front of Horace. Because of the deception Mortimer breaks off his engagement with Magdalen and instead goes to live in a boarding house recommended by Bullivant. Before he leaves he tells Bullivant that the letter incident has made him realize that Miss Buchanan is illiterate. He urges Bullivant to socialize with her which he does. However during fits of irritation Bullivant occasionally places Miss Buchanan in an awkward position by asking her to read. He later shares Miss Buchanan's secret with the cook, Mrs. Selden. Despite the betrayal Horace misses Mortimer deeply. When he discovers that his two eldest sons conspired to let him die in an accident he is further distraught. Mortimer arrives just after Horace discovers the betrayal and persuades Horace to let him back into the house reasoning that it was Mortimer's relationship with Charlotte that inspired Horace to mend his ways and that he no longer loves Charlotte knowing that she will always put her children first. Going for a walk to reflect upon his children's betrayal, Horace narrowly escapes death and blames his sons when discovering one of their pocket knives near the scene of the crime. However it is quickly revealed that George, a young servant who resents his position and who has been stealing from the family, conspired to hurt Horace. George is punished by Bullivant who hopes that he will repent, though this seems far from likely. Horace grows sick from the cold and almost dies, causing the household to repent of their actions to him, and then makes a miraculous recovery. Miss Buchanan visits the servants and her secret is revealed by George, who then confesses he overheard Bullivant tell the cook. Though Miss Buchanan believes she will be illiterate until she dies, the teenage cook's assistant Miriam offers to teach her as she taught young children in the orphanage where she grew up.

Background Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib was a great-grandson of Oqba ibn Nafi al-Fihri (Muslim Arab conqueror of North Africa). His family, the al- Fihris, were among the leading Arab families of the Maghreb. In 740, Ibn Habib joined his father Habib ibn Abi Obeida in an Arab expedition across the water to Sicily in what was possibly the first attempt at a full-scale invasion of the island (rather than a mere raid). They had a successful landing and laid a brief siege to Syracuse, securing its submission and agreement to pay tribute. But the break-out of the Great Berber Revolt in the Maghreb forced the al- Fihris to cease their invasion of Sicily and ship their army quickly back to North Africa to help quell the uprising. The Arabs were defeated by the Berbers at the Battle of Bagdoura (near the Sebou) in 741. His father was killed in the field of battle, while Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib narrowly escaped and fled across the straits to Spain with the remnant of the Arab army. While in Spain, Ibn Habib involved himself in the conflicts which immediately erupted between the commanders of the defeated army (the Syrian regiments or )), and the resident governor, Abd al-Malik ibn Qatan al-Fihri. When the Syrian commander Balj ibn Bishr al-Qushayri tortured and executed the elderly Ibn Qatan, a Fihrid relative, Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib openly broke with the Syrians and joined the Andalusian (baladi) party. Ibn Habib participated in the Battle of Aqua Portora in August 740 and it was claimed by at least one chronicler (Ibn al-Khatam) that he sought out and fatally wounded Balj in the heat of battle (although the chronicler may have confused Ibn Habib with another Abd al-Rahman, Ibn al-Qama al-Lakhmi, the governor of Narbonne and commander of the Andalusians). In the aftermath, Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib tried to put himself forward as a candidate to replace the governor, but gave up on these ambitions with the arrival of Abu al-Khattar ibn Dirar al-Kalbi as Andalusian governor in 743, who then set about pacifying the situation. Soon after, Ibn Habib left Spain and returned to Ifriqiya (although, apparently, he may have left his son, Yusuf, behind). Ibn Habib may have served briefly under the Kairouan governor, Handhala ibn Safwan al-Kalbi, in a variety of military capacities, including command of the Tunis garrison. Tunisian Coup In late 744, in the turmoil following the death of the Umayyad caliph, Hisham, Abd al- Rahman ibn Habib assembled a small force in Tunis and declared himself emir of Ifriqiya. Although urged to quash the usurper, the Ifriqiyan governor Handhala ibn Safwan al-Kalbi decided it was best to avoid bloodshed and consented to return to Damascus in February 745, rather than put up a fight. Nonetheless, on hearing of the governor's departure, Handhala ibn Safwan laid a curse on the usurper: \\"Oh God, do not permit Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib to enjoy his usurped authority! Let his partisans derive no profit from this attempt, may they shed each other's blood! Send against them, O Lord, the most evil of all the men You have created!\\" En-Nuweiri, as quoted in \\"De la Province d'Afrique et du Maghrib, traduite de l'arabe d'En-Noweiri par M. le baron MacGuckin de Slane\\", 1841, Journal Asiatique, p.451-52 Handhala extended the curse to Ifriqiya itself, the land and its ungrateful people, invoking upon them famine, pestilence and war. As it turned out, save from some brief seasonal interruptions, Ifriqiya was indeed gripped by pestilence for the next seven years. Ruler in Ifriqiya Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib had come to power essentially as the figurehead of the local Arab high military caste, a group much despised and feared by the common population. Their appetites and aspirations had long been kept in check by the Umayyad governors. But with the connection with Damascus now cut, the high nobles fully expected to be allowed free rein by 'their' emir. But they were soon to be disappointed. Ibn Habib wanted a country to govern, and was not prepared to see it fragmented and handed over to the anarchic ways of a feudal nobility. Ibn Habib consequently faced the prospect of revolts whatever he did - should the nobles be let loose, the people would revolt; hold the reins tight, the nobles would turn against him. To assert himself Ibn Habib consequently turned to his greatest asset - his family, the Fihrids. No sooner had Ibn Habib installed himself in Kairouan, then revolts by Arabs and Berbers, began erupting all over the country. Tunis was raised to revolt by Orwa ibn ez-Zobeir es-Sadefi, Tabinas by Ibn Attaf el-Azdi, B√©ja was taken by the Sanhaja Berber rebel Thabit al- Sanhaji, and many more. Ibn Habib patiently and ruthlessly crushed the revolts one by one. The most serious threat came from Tripolitana, then governed by Ibn Habib's brother Ilyas ibn Habib al-Fihri. In 747, Ilyas tried to crack down on the fledgling Ibadites, a puritanical Kharijite sect, that was growing strong in the cities of Djerba and Tripoli and among the Berbers in the surrounding districts. The Ibadites, inspired by the success of their brethren in Hadramut and Oman, revolted under the leadership of their imam al-Harith, and seized control of much of Tripolitana (between Gab√®s and Sirte). But in 752, Ibn Habib dispatched an Ifriqiyan army and reconquered Tripolitana from the Ibadites, driving their remnants south into the Jebel Nafusa. In Spain, Handhala's deputy Abu al-Khattar ibn Dirar al-Kalbi had been toppled in 745 and civil war broke out anew between the Syrian and the Andalusian Arabs. Ibn Habib intervened, dispatching an Ifriqiyan force to help restore order. In 747, Ibn Habib's kinsman (by patronymic record, his son), Yusuf ibn 'Abd al- Rahman al-Fihri, was put forward as a compromise candidate and installed as governor of al-Andalus. But the western Maghreb - Morocco and eastern Algeria - remained out of his reach. Since the Berber Revolt of 740, the region had descended into tribal anarchy. It was fragmented and ruled autonomously by Berber tribes. The Masmuda Berber tribes established an independent state in 744, the Berghwata confederation, with their own 'prophet' and syncretist beliefs. Ibn Habib's attempts to reimpose his rule there failed. In 752, perhaps feeling confident in the possession of his lands for the first time, Ibn Habib transported an Ifriqiyan army to Sicily, perhaps hoping to resume the invasion his father had interrupted back in 740. But finding the defences too strong, the expedition limited itself to raiding the coasts and returned to North Africa. Relations with the Caliphs Ibn Habib also tried to repair his relations with Damascus. After repeated entreaties, he finally managed to secure confirmation in his post from the Umayyad Caliph Marwan II. Marwan II did not really have any options, for at that time, his resources were engaged in fending off the Abbasid Revolution. Egypt fell to the Abbasids in the middle of 750 and the last Umayyad caliph Marwan II was caught and killed. Hoping the chaos in the east would allow him to carve out an independent state for himself, Ifriqiyan governor Ibn Habib at first sought an understanding with the Abbasids but was soon disappointed by Abbasid demands for submission. Ibn Habib then decided to revolt against the Abbasids and dropped the name of the Abbasid caliph from the Friday prayers, publicly burnt the official robes of state dispatched by the Abbasids and invited the fleeing members of the Umayyad clan to take refuge in his dominions. Among his guests was the Umayyad prince, Abd al-Rahman ibn Mu‚Äôawiya ibn Hisham, a grandson of Caliph Hisham. Two other notables, sons of the caliph Walid II, were appointed to high posts, one of them made qadi of Kairouan. His own brother, Ilyas ibn Habib, married into the Umayyad family. But not long after their arrival, Ibn Habib changed his mind, probably fearing the prominent Umayyad exiles might serve as a focal point for discontented Arab nobles and challenge his own usurped power. Ibn Habib expressed sufficient hostility to prompt the fugitive Umayyad prince to flee into the hinterlands of Kabylie and hide among the Nafza Berbers (his mother's family). In 755, Abd al-Rahman left in his African hideout and crossed the straits to Spain and went on to depose Yusuf al-Fihri and found the Umayyad emirate of C√≥rdoba in 756. In 755, Ibn Habib discovered what he thought was a plot engineered by the Umayyad qadi, and ordered the arrest and execution of the plotters. But he didn't count on the revenge of his sister- in-law, the Umayyad wife of his brother Ilyas. Later that year, urged on by his wife, Ilyas assassinated his brother Abd al-Rahman ibn Habib in his personal quarters, plunging a dagger into his back while he played with his children.Ibn Khaldun (1852:368); Mercier (1888:p.240) Ilyas ibn Habib proceeded to assume power for himself, but was himself deposed and killed by the end of the year by Abd al-Rahman's son, Habib ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Fihri. In 757, the Warfajuma Berbers and their Sufrite allies swept up from southern Tunisia and captured Kairouan, killing Habib and putting an end to the Fihrid dynasty. In the meantime, the Ibadites that Ibn Habib had driven out of Tripoli came back. Rallied by their imam Abu al-Khattab al-Ma'afiri in Jebel Nefusa, the Ibadites recaptured Tripoli and went on to take Kairouan from the Berbers in 758, establishing a Kharijite imamate over Ifriqiya.

In 2013, she reveals that she had previously given up a child for adoption, who is later discovered to be Dylan McAvoy (Steve Burton). The character has also had several other notorious relationships, including Paul Williams (Doug Davidson), Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), and Brad Carlton (Don Diamont). Scott is considered an icon in the soap opera genre. Casting The role of Nikki Reed was first portrayed by actress Erica Hope from 1978 to early 1979. The role was then recast with Scott, who began appearing in February 1979, and has portrayed Nikki since. In 1984, Robin Eisenman temporarily portrayed the role. Scott recalled in 1989 that she was surprised to have received the role, as she hadn't acted in a few years.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Nv4xAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=0wUEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5136%2C1480627https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nC5UAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=Vo0DAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6315%2C556683 In May 2001, Scott and the show's producers entered contract negotiations following rumors that she was unhappy because of Nikki's lack of airtime. Soap Opera Digest speculated that she was possibly joining General Hospital as Heather Webber. Three months later, controversy arose when Scott was seen moving personal belongings from her dressing room. However, speculation ended in August 2001, when it was announced that Scott had inked a contract to further extend her portrayal of Nikki. In May 2009, Nelson Branco of TV Guide Canada reported that Scott had been asked to accept a salary cut, or be taken off her contract and dropped to a recurring status. The actress reportedly refused either option. Scott later began contract negotiations again, which resulted in Nikki being written out of the soap opera after an agreement could not be met. Scott later signed another contract to continue her portrayal, but in 2011, the actress' future was left in uncertainty, because of the soap opera's financial issues. Scott expressed disappointment, stating: \\"It was not handled very well. I've been in this business since I was three and I know how this works. If a show is having problems with money or budget, they call the actor very respectfully and say, \\"We have a little financial crunch here. Let's try to work something out, okay?\\" That's what should have happened. The problem was that such a phone call was never made to me and I was left in the lurch.\\" However, Scott renewed her contract and returned after an onscreen absence. Development =Characterization= According to the soap opera's website, the character \\"has matured from the girl from the wrong side of the tracks to the serial‚Äôs luminous and resourceful heroine.\\" The Observer‚ÄìReporter described Nikki as \\"oft-married\\". Of playing the character's ongoing tragic life, Scott stated: \\"Ever since I have been an actress, which is 56 years now, I have always preferred high drama, angst, and catastrophes. I find it more interesting to play. I guess it‚Äôs no accident that I found my way into soap operas.\\" In 1988, Scott stated in an interview that in her first nine years on the soap opera, she thought that Nikki had \\"grown up\\". In 1995, Scott said that she was \\"quite bored\\" with her character, stating: \\"We seem to be in a bit of a slump ‚Äî all Nikki seems to do is have coffee and do needlepoint. She has beautiful clothes and her makeup is perfect and she never leaves her house. She used to sit here and drink ‚Äî that was actually more fun. But needlepoint ‚Äî I'm sorry.\\" Speaking about Nikki's \\"desperation housewife\\" problems with Michael Logan of TV Guide, Scott stated, \\"Nikki should never have a job! She would never want a job. She's not capable of doing anything, and she wouldn't want to be trained to do anything. It's so much better when she stays home. I'm looking forward to playing her as a crazy old lady.\\" =Relationships= Eric Braeden portrays Victor, Nikki's main love interest for over three decades. Their union has registered \\"an enduring appeal\\" among viewers. For over three decades, Nikki has been romantically linked with Victor Newman (Eric Braeden). Nikki was originally from the lower walks of life, having been a prostitute and stripper. After multiple failed relationships, she began a romance with Victor, who taught her about society. They fall in love and have a child, Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle), and later a son, Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). The couple are widely considered a supercouple within the soap opera media. The writers of The Young and the Restless detailed their characters to marry and divorce or depart from each other in some form or fashion in a continuous cycle, which is a take on the original supercouple formula. Soap Opera Digest relayed the beginning of the pairing's creation and their impact, described as an \\"inspired decision\\", led to Victor and Nikki becoming the series' most successful supercouple. In an interview with Dose magazine, Scott said that the couple always has to get back together, but not without a challenge. Nikki and Victor are recognized as one of daytime television's most prominent couples. They have also garnered a large fan following, dubbed \\"Niktor\\" by viewers. In addition, the couple's weddings have been reported by mainstream media. Scott has said: \\"Let‚Äôs face facts: Victor and Nikki will always be a huge dynamic, they‚Äôve been in a circular cycle for over 30 years! Finding a new leading man that you have chemistry with is like finding gold.\\" In a 1994 interview with The Los Angeles Times, the newspaper reported that Victor's relationship with Nikki had \\"registered an enduring appeal among viewers\\", with Braeden replying that, \\"Arguably, it's the idea of this incredibly powerful, wealthy man taking a woman who comes from the wrong side of the tracks into his life, and shaping her and forming her more to his liking. But, of course, no one can shape or form anyone, she remains who she is, has retained her strength, and that causes conflict.\\" In other interviews, Braeden stated that he loves working with Scott and that he \\"always thought it was an honestly felt love story with great material for conflict with Nikki\\". He also stated in an interview that he considers Victor's storylines with Nikki to be some of his favorites. Discussing Victor and Nikki's union, former As the World Turns actress Martha Byrne stated: \\"Young and Restless' Victor and Nikki are the perfect example of a couple who they can tear apart and put back together how many times? And [the writers] do it really well because they're so stable as characters that you can basically do anything with them now, and the audience will go on the journey with them.\\" The Museum of Television and Radio wrote: \\"Combined with a series of social-issue storylines covering everything from AIDS to date rape to the plight of the elderly, as well as featuring a group of popular young African-American characters, and several long-term romantic and professional relationships, Victor and Nikki's love story has kept viewers enthralled for many years.\\" They also described their relationship as being a \\"dominant force\\" in the soap opera. Daytime journalist Michael Fairman stated: \\"Victor and Nikki just can‚Äôt, we mean can‚Äôt, ever get it together long enough to find any happiness with each other. So, many would say that they deserve each other and the baggage and betrayals that come along with their co-dependent relationship.\\" Aside from Victor, Nikki is known for her relationships with Paul Williams (Doug Davidson) and Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), Victor's business rival. Tommy Garrett of Canyon News called the character the love of Paul's life. Nikki often \\"ditches\\" other men if Victor is in trouble; Scott called her leaving Brad Carlton (Don Diamont) at the altar following Victor being shot \\"another dramatic ditching\\". In 2012, she left Jack the day after their wedding to find a missing Victor; Scott commented, \\"It was written as it was, so I don‚Äôt speculate. She has done it before ... perhaps she will do it again.\\" She stated that she doesn't desire for Nikki and Victor to be happy together for long because it is \\"boring\\" and there must be some kind of conflict. Teasing the Nikki and Victor storyline, Scott said that, \\"Trouble follows trouble and when it rains it pours.\\" From 2010 onward, Nikki was in a relationship with Deacon Sharpe (Sean Kanan). However, it was later revealed that he was working with Meggie McClaine (Sean Young) to ruin her sobriety and send her back to rehab. However, Deacon began to fall for Nikki. Of their relationship, Scott stated: \\"Deacon has more balls than Nikki expected and he keeps coming back, determined to convince her he truly loves her. At one point, he slips the AA serenity prayer under her door, which she is disgusted to see. She just ignores it and drinks all night. She really does have feelings for him. But this betrayal is something she won't get over soon.\\" =Illnesses= Over the course of her duration on the soap opera, the character has battled alcoholism, breast cancer and most recently, multiple sclerosis. Scott has stated in multiple interviews that she enjoys portraying Nikki's struggle with alcohol. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly in 2011, Scott said that she \\"loves Nikki drinking\\" and enjoys the material as an actress, stating: \\"It‚Äôs much more fun, and everybody seems to prefer a drunk Nikki.\\" During the character's battle with alcoholism, she also developed an addiction for prescription pills. To the dismay of Scott, the storyline concluded abruptly. The actress said, \\"It never really finished properly. Nikki just woke up one day and decided that she's fine now. I felt that was unrealistic. I would like to follow Nikki through rehab and detox. I want to find a good conclusion. Maybe this new story line will address that. It's looking like it might.\\" Scott has previously voiced her admiration for playing Nikki's alcoholism because \\"it's so much fun to play\\" a \\"drunk or insane or flawed\\". In February 2013, it was revealed that Nikki would be diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). Jillian Bowe of Zap2it said viewers got \\"a bit of shock when they saw the socialite‚Äôs hands shake after she tickled the ivories in her new deluxe apartment.\\" Scott discussed the storyline with TV Guide. She said she wants the story to \\"educate people\\" that it's \\"controllable with the proper treatment\\". Not all people can easily \\"control\\" their MS. MS is a highly variable and often disabling disease, and effects each person very differently. Scott met a worker on the set of the show who was diagnosed with MS, and said it was \\"very encouraging\\" to know about her for the storyline. She further said, \\"I did have a sit-down meeting, a little three-way with [head writer] Josh Griffith and [executive producer] Jill Farren Phelps. They wanted to know how I felt about the idea, and I told them I thought it was great. Josh didn't know I used to play piano on Y&R; way back when, so he decided to revive that and use it to show the beginnings of Nikki's symptoms ‚Äî the shaky hands, the cramping, the feeling you've got arthritis.\\" =Rivalries and friendships= Nikki is known for her rivalries with Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson), Jill Abbott (Jess Walton), Sharon Newman (Sharon Case) and Diane Jenkins (Maura West). She fought with Diane over Victor for years as their bitter rivalry climaxed; she later killed Diane in self-defense in August 2011. Scott didn't think Nikki should have been the killer in a whodunnit? storyline. She stated, \\"Nikki has always hated Diane and because Maura is so good in the role, Nikki hates her even more now.\\" Sharon is Nikki's former daughter-in-law, having been married to her son Nicholas (Joshua Morrow) for over a decade. Nikki later became outraged when Sharon had a brief romance with Victor. Luke Kerr of Zap2it said: \\"It‚Äôs always reassuring to know Nikki will usually jump to \\"blame Sharon\\" for just about everything. Based on their past, it's not surprising, but it's a comfort food type Y&R; trope.\\" Nikki and Sharon even ended up in a physical fight in the Newman stables over Victor in 2012; Jillian Bowe, also of Zap2it, called it the \\"Newman Divas\\" face off, and said, \\"Victor's ladies go for blood. It boggles the mind these two sophisticated women are fighting over Victor's giblets and gravy.\\" Scott stated that she loved the Newman stables fight, saying: \\"Our director was very gracious, and was very loose and not rigid about blocking, and let us do our own choreography. So, if you look at it again, there are many elements of an I Love Lucy episode. Guess where that came from? But I couldn‚Äôt resist it. I had to do it! All the water and hair pulling and dunking in the bucket, that was all me, because that was \\"Lucy\\"!\\" Amid her rivalries with most women in Genoa City, she is close with the show's matriarch Katherine Chancellor (Jeanne Cooper), Scott said that \\"Katherine and Nikki have a very special relationship, and they have a very special heartbeat\\". However, off-screen, there was a period of time in which Scott experienced a \\"rocky\\" relationship with Cooper. Cooper explained: \\"It was just some silly thing, I guess [...] You think it‚Äôs strange. You should have been me! I mean, here is someone who is like a daughter to me. I really was very protective of her\\". Storylines Nikki was introduced with her sister Casey in 1978. The following year, she killed her abusive father Nick Reed (Quinn Redeker) in self-defense after he drunkenly tried to rape her. During the murder trial, Jill Foster (Brenda Dickson) hired a Nick look-alike named Joseph Thomas to scare Nikki and Casey. Following the trial, she dated Paul Williams (Doug Davidson), but it ended after he gave her a venereal disease. Nikki would go on to romance Greg Foster (Wings Hauser). While Paul opposed the relationship, she ultimately married Greg. Rose Deville (Darlene Conley) signed Nikki to a \\"modelling agency\\" which was later revealed to be a prostitution ring. Nikki resisted a customer, who later had a heart attack. A man named Tony was charged for the murder, with Greg representing him. Nikki was threatened not to testify in the case or Greg would be killed. She decided to leave town, but returned a little while later. Nikki would later join the New World Commune and Paul would join her. However, they discovered that it was actually a cult, and Nikki would become pregnant after being raped by a cult leader, Ian Ward. Steven Williams and Peggy Brooks worked to expose the cult, and Nikki ended up escaping to Chicago. She gave birth to the child, later to be known as Dylan McAvoy, in a church, but passed out during labor and the nuns took the baby away. Greg, thinking Nikki and Paul had reunited, divorced Nikki. Once Nikki returned to Genoa City, she became a stripper while romancing Kevin Bancroft (Christopher Holder). Kevin's mother Allison Bancroft (Lynn Wood) hated Nikki, and bought a pornographic film titled Hot Hips, purportedly starring Nikki, hoping Kevin would leave her, which he did. A criminal named Tony DiSalvo distributed the film. Nikki married him in hopes of getting her hands on the film rights, and later found out she wasn't even in the film. Paul and his partner Andy Richards investigated Tony and killed him. While still a stripper, she had a fling with rich business tycoon Victor Newman (Eric Braeden), and became pregnant with his child. Initially, however, Nikki believed that the child was Kevin's, but it turned out to be Victor's. She gave birth to Victoria in 1982 while still married to Kevin. After Tony's death, Victor moved on with Lorie Brooks (Jamie Lyn Bauer), while Nikki hooked up with Rick Daros. Unknown to Nikki, Rick killed his first wife and intended on doing the same to Nikki. Once Victor learned of Rick and Victoria's true paternity, he, Paul, and Andy rushed to St. Croix to save Nikki. In a gunfight, Rick escaped while a shot Victor professed his love for Nikki and proposed. Once Victor recovered, he and Nikki married in 1984 despite interference from his ex Eve Howard. Eve had previously tried to kill Nikki before the wedding ceremony, later running off with Rick Daros. Victor and Nikki's marriage was strong until he had an affair with Ashley Abbott (Eileen Davidson), the sister of rival businessman Jack Abbott (Terry Lester). At the same time, Jack was attracted to Nikki, and they began an affair. Victor left Nikki for Ashley who ended up pregnant, but secretly had an abortion. Nikki schemed to break up Victor and Ashley by using Matt Miller (Victor's brother) to seduce Ashley, but failed. Nikki was soon diagnosed with a terminal illness bringing Victor back. Once she recovered and lied to Victor about it, Victor returned to Ashley until he learned of her abortion. Nikki ended up giving birth to a son, Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow), but shortly thereafter Victor divorced Nikki thinking she was involved in Jack's role in a tell-all biography about Victor. Unknown to Victor, the book was actually written by Leanna Love (Barbara Crampton). Once Victor learned the truth of Leanna's book, he tried to win back Nikki through a business deal with Jack (now Peter Bergman). Yet the deal fell through and, out of spite, Jack and Nikki married in 1990 as Victor ended up marrying Ashley. Her marriage to Jack was unsuccessful; his business with Jabot Cosmetics got in the way of their \\"friendly\\" marriage. Following a riding accident where she miscarried a child of hers and Jack's, she sunk into a state of depression, developing addictions to painkillers and being an alcoholic to help her recovery. Victor would eventually return to Nikki's side in her addictions, but Nikki ended up pregnant with Jack's son. After an argument with Victor, Nikki gave birth to a stillborn, John Abbott III, and Jack divorced Nikki, but they remained friends. Nikki was devastated soon after when Victor \\"died\\" after finding a burned body inside his car in Kansas, although it turned out he was alive. Victor had been living in Kansas with Hope Adams (Signy Coleman). Nikki during this time began a relationship with Brad Carlton (Don Diamont) and later got engaged. Victor and Hope came back to Genoa City, much to everyone's amazement. On the night of Nikki and Brad's wedding, Victor was shot by Mari Jo Mason. She left Brad at the altar and rushed to Victor's side. Victor ended up choosing to return to Hope. While Victor returned to Kansas, Nikki married her doctor Dr. Joshua Landers (Heath Kizzier). Victor's relationship with Hope ended, and he returned to Genoa City to stop Nikki and Joshua from marrying. However, Victor would go on to get involved with Jack's former lover Diane Jenkins (Alex Donelley). Jealous of Diane, Nikki convinced Victor to have a vasectomy before she secretly stored his sperm in a bank. Joshua was shot and killed by his presumed dead mentally ill ex-wife, Veronica (Candice Daly), who had disguised herself and had been posing as Nikki and Joshua's maid, Sarah Lindsey. Hours later, having been the victim of emotional abuse from Nikki for many months, Veronica shot and severely wounded her employer, leading Victor to divorce Diane and remarry Nikki on her deathbed. Victor promised Diane that he would remarry her after Nikki died. When Nikki miraculously recovered, Victor decided to be with her instead of Diane. Yet, Victor was still legally married to Diane and their divorce continued into 2000. Diane remained in love with Victor and stole his sperm to impregnate herself with his child. However, Ashley and Nikki too stole the sperm and a mix-up was created. Ashley became pregnant with Victor's child and Diane with Jack's. Ashley gave birth to Abby Carlton (Brad was thought to be the father) and Nikki was engaged to Victor by 2002. Their engagement was hindered by Victor's old fianc√©e Lorie Brooks and her soon to be ex-husband Max Hollister schemed to break them up. Max was involved in a bad business deal with Victor regarding Julia Newman Martin's design firm. In the end, Lorie couldn't follow through, and Victor and Nikki remarried in September. Shortly into Victor and Nikki's remarriage, Nikki was kidnapped resulting in post-traumatic stress disorder and was shot by a carjacker. Nikki began having more memories about her childhood and ended up having an affair with Bobby Marsino, who was the brother of one of Nikki's childhood friends whom she accidentally killed. In 2005, their granddaughter Cassie (Camryn Grimes) was killed in a car accident. Then, Nikki developed more of an interest in business. Several years earlier, with Jabot in dire straits, Nikki gave them $35 million to help get the company out of debt. Nikki then became a stockholder at the company and had a seat on the board; much to everyone's dismay. Nikki later sold her stock to start her own company, NVP Retreats (a wellness spa company). In 2007, she ran against ex-husband Jack in the race for Wisconsin state senate, but after a few mistakes and being caught on tape kissing her campaign manager, David Chow (Vincent Irizarry), she lost the election. Victor and Nikki eventually divorced, fueled by her involvement with David Chow. She walked away with a $100-million divorce settlement. After Katherine Chancellor stepped down as CEO of Jabot, Nikki took over; this caused tension between Nikki and Katherine's \\"daughter\\" Jill. Nikki stepped down as CEO of Jabot after hearing that David had killed Ji Min Kim, Jill's current lover. Regardless, Nikki married David Chow in June 2008 in Mexico. It was revealed that he was addicted to gambling. Paul Williams investigated David and found that \\"David\\" was not even his real name. Upon learning David was going to drug her, Nikki was going to ask for a divorce. However, David died in a car accident, which also killed Victor's wife Sabrina Newman. Victor and Nikki's relationship as friends broke down around this time, too, after she tried to console him. After Victor disappeared again, Nikki became determined to find him, however, she ended up getting involved with her early love, private investigator and long time friend Paul, while Victor and Ashley reconnected. By May 2009, Nikki accepted Paul's marriage proposal, but the night before their wedding, she broke things off and left town. She once again returned, and after Victor was shot by Patty Williams, Nikki left with him after a heart transplant to undergo rehabilitation in a center in Europe. When Victor and Nikki returned in 2010, they were engaged. Meggie McClaine, a friend of Victor, had moved in for her own protection. Meggie sabotaged Nikki, getting her drunk so that she could marry Victor instead of Nikki. Meggie recruited Deacon Sharpe to help get Nikki off the wagon. Nikki went to rehab. When she learned of Victor and Meggie's marriage (which was just a scam to have Meggie caught) she had an affair with Deacon, ending her relationship with Victor. Nikki continued her romance with Deacon, without knowing the truth. Nikki and Victor slept together after he lost a lawsuit against his children; however, he was involved with Diane Jenkins at the time. Upon learning the truth about Deacon's role in her drinking, Nikki left him but it was too late for her to return to Victor, who had married Diane. Alone, she began drinking once again. After several attempts at trying to get back together, Victor and Nikki parted ways, and she returned to rehab. Diane was killed months after, and Victor was jailed for her murder. After being missing from rehab for several months, Nikki returned home. She confesses that she escaped rehab to help her family in the aftermath of the Diane Jenkin's murder investigation. Deacon threatened to confess that he saw Victor, Victoria and Nicholas in the park the night of Diane's murder unless Nikki would marry him; she agreed. Nikki began having memory lapses of her night in the park with Diane; realizing that she had killed her, not Victor. She confessed to this at Victor's trial. Detective Ronan Malloy arrested Nikki for the murder; however, footage from the night, shot by Deacon, revealed that while Nikki did kill Diane at the park, it was in self-defense. Additional footage showed that Deacon finished her off, serving the last fatal blow to Diane's head. Deacon was jailed and his marriage to Nikki ended. Nikki's brief relationship with Victor failed; she began to reconnect with Jack who was suffering from a gunshot wound from Patty Williams that had left him paralyzed. Their relationship heated up, much to the dismay of Kyle, yet he came to accept the relationship, and Nikki and Jack remarried. Yet, the day of her marriage, Victor remarried Sharon Newman, but then went suddenly missing. Nikki ended up leaving Genoa City to try to find Victor, but to no avail. When she returned, Jack decided they should divorce. Victor later returned, having lived in Los Angeles with amnesia. He reunited with Nikki and set out to destroy Sharon and Tucker McCall who took control of Newman during his absence. After Victor lost control of Newman to Jack through a hostile takeover, Victor suffered a heart attack, and later Sharon burned down the Newman Ranch during a mental breakdown. Once Victor escaped the hospital to visit the ruins, he and Nikki finally got engaged. However, their wedding was delayed because Nikki was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Victor and Nikki finally remarried on March 20, 2013, in a ceremony that ended with Adam Newman (Michael Muhney) taking an assassin's bullet meant for Victor. Adam survived, and he and Victor began to rebuild their relationship. Nikki continued with her MS treatments, and held fundraisers for research. Katherine Chancellor died in August after a three- month vacation around the world. Katherine left Nikki and Jill in charge of her memorial service, and left Nikki a letter encouraging her to look into the child she had following her stay at the New World Commune. Reception The character and actress are considered icons in American daytime television. TV Guide has said that Scott has become \\"immensely popular\\" over the course of her run. Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps describes Scott as the \\"leading lady of Y&R;\\". BuzzWorthy Radio wrote that Scott is \\"a true fan favorite and daytime royalty\\". Former executive producer and head writer Maria Arena Bell called Nikki one of the \\"hearts and souls\\" on the soap opera, and said: \\"Melody is a phenomenal actress. Nikki is one of the great core characters of The Young and the Restless.\\" Nikki's pairing with Victor has received positive reviews from critics throughout the years; The News & Advance cited Victor and Nikki with other romances considered \\"epic\\" of the early supercouple era. Global News wrote of their long-standing relationship, \\"Victor is the consummate womanizer and has been a part of many relationships over the years. Nonetheless, his heart belongs to one woman alone, the stunning Nikki Reed. Despite true love and good intention, the relationship between Victor and Nikki has always been troubled by poor timing and miscommunication.\\" Jae Jones of Yahoo! wrote in 2011, \\"Over the years fans have watch Victor and Nikki break up and get back together more times than they can keep track. The love between the two has always been strong, but it doesn't seem strong enough to keep the two together.\\" In 1987, Lilana Novakovich of the Toronto Star wrote that Nikki was the \\"lucky missus of the sexy Eric Braeden\\". A syndicated article that appeared in The Vindicator in 2003 stated of Nikki and Victor's relationship, \\"Their relationship is both strong and mistrustful, fraught with passion and tension.\\" The Austin American-Statesman acclaimed Scott's portrayal in 1991, writing: \\"After 12 long years of portraying Nikki Newman Abbott on The Young and the Restless, Melody Thomas Scott has become a master at tackling one on-screen dilemma after another. Since Nikki's arrival in Genoa City back in 1979, she has been brainwashed by a bizarre religious cult; gotten caught up in the world of striptease and circa 1987 miraculously survived a \\"fatal\\" disease called sarcoidosis.\\" In October 1992, Marla Hart of the Chicago Tribune wrote of the character's life at the time, saying: \\"There's the Newman living room and its bar, where Nikki has gotten plastered; the ruffly bedroom where she has fretted over her two main squeezes, Jack Abbott and Victor Newman; and Victor's marble-ized office, where Nikki Newman Abbott has cried on the leather sofa scores of times.\\" In 2002, Entertainment Weekly wrote that the soap opera was \\"keeping it real\\" with Victor and Nikki's third wedding. Upon their fourth wedding in 2013, the magazine stated: \\"Say what you will about Victor (and we‚Äôve all said a lot), but the ol‚Äô boy definitely knows who is best for him ‚Äî Nikki.\\" In 2006, when Scott celebrated 27 years on the soap opera, the Jamaica Gleaner wrote of her portrayal and the character's evolution, \\"As Nikki Reed Newman ‚Äî a character who has been married seven times (twice to Victor), been addicted to alcohol and pain pills, killed her sexual-molester father and been shot several times ‚Äî Melody has an exciting alter ego. Through it all, Nikki has matured into the strong, independent woman that she is today.\\" In 2011, the soap opera's ratings reportedly decreased when Scott was absent. When she renewed her contract with the series, Michael Logan of TV Guide wrote: \\"Our long national nightmare is over! Execs at The Young and the Restless have finally seen the light and are bringing Melody Thomas Scott back to the show.\\" He also wrote that it was \\"not a smooth move\\" to keep Scott off the soap opera, saying: \\"Considering Thomas Scott was at the top of storyline ‚Äî and giving the performance of her career ‚Äî when Nikki suddenly left Genoa City and went into rehab. Curiously, those money issues at Y&R; didn't stop the suits from hiring lots of new high- profile faces in recent months, including Emmy-winning suds greats Genie Francis and Debbi Morgan ‚Äî a fact that did not go ignored by Thomas Scott's legion of irate fans who organized a massive Twitter campaign to bring their girl back.\\" Lori Harito of Global wrote that \\"the woman we love to hate\\" would be \\"back on our screens, no doubt butting heads with Victor Newman\\". Sara Bibel of Xfinity wrote that she had hoped Nikki's relationship with Deacon Sharpe (Sean Kanan) would blossom into a \\"real romance\\". She also wrote about Nikki and Victor's union, stating: \\"Nikki and Victor‚Äôs (Eric Braeden) romance has lasted three decades because they were separated for years at a time, involved in fully developed, longterm relationships with other characters, while continuing to be drawn into each other‚Äôs orbit. It‚Äôs a shame that the current regime has not realized the story potential of keeping these characters apart.\\" Bibel criticized Nikki's reunion with Jack in 2012, blaming it on the soap opera's \\"creative trouble\\". She wrote: \\"They were a great couple the first time they got together. There seemed like a parallel between the back problems that Nikki was struggling with when they were married and Jack‚Äôs paralysis. It seemed like the recipe for a beautiful love story, as Nikki helped Jack realize that he was still desirable despite his injury and help him adjust to the changes in his life until, being that this is a soap, he miraculously regains the ability to walk again. Instead of watching a friendship bloom into romance, Jack and Nikki hooked up one night in Vegas and, bam, instant relationship.\\" The following year, she predicted Nikki could be potentially diagnosed with either multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease. Bibel wrote that she usually finds soap opera medical storylines \\"tedious because I know going in that the character will inevitably be cured. But giving a character a chronic but manageable illness is a fresh spin.\\" Scott's portrayal has garnered numerous accolades throughout the years, including nominations for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 1999 and the Special Fan Award in 2001. She has received six Soap Opera Digest Award nominations, winning once in 2001 for Outstanding Lead Actress.

He also, speaking of himself in the third person, lets it be known that he was one of the clergy of Augustine's monastery.Bacchus, Francis Joseph. \\"St. Possidius.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 10 January 2020 The date of his promotion to the episcopate was, according to Tillemont, about 397. He followed Augustine's example and established a monastery at Calama, an area must disturbed by factions. At a council held at Carthage, Possidius challenged Crispinus, the Donatist Bishop of Calama, to a public discussion which the latter refused. In 404 a party of Donatists dragged Possidius out of his house, beat him, and threatened his life. Donatist extremists set fire to a house where Possidius was visiting.\\"St. Possidius\\", Province of Our Mother of Good Counsel of the Augustinian Order/ Midwest Augustines Legal proceedings were instituted against Crispinus, the bishop, who refused to punish the presbyter responsible. Crispinus was condemned for heresy and was heavily fined, but at the intercession of Possidius the fine was not exacted). In 407, Possidius served, with Augustine and five other bishops, on a committee appointed to adjudicate upon some ecclesiastical matter, the particulars of which are not known. In 408 he nearly lost his life in a riot stirred up by the pagans at Calama (Augustine, \\"Epp.\\", xc, xci, xciii). In 409 he was one of four bishops deputed to go to Italy to obtain the protection of the emperor against the Donatists. He was one of the seven bishops chosen to represent the Catholic party at the collatio of 411. In 416 he assisted at the Council of Milevum, where fifty-nine Numidian bishops addressed a synodal letter to Innocent I, asking him to take action against Pelagianism. He joined with Augustine and three other bishops in a further letter to Innocent on the same subject, and was at the conference between Augustine and the Donatist Emeritus. When the Germanic Vandals invaded Africa, he fled to Hippo and was present at the death of Augustine (430).Butler, Alban. ‚ÄúSaint Possidius, Bishop and Confessor‚Äù.

It included an adjustable paper tray, which enabled it to print on several paper sizes including A4, letter-size, and those of legal and envelope varieties. It was very similar to other printers based on the Canon SX engine, such as the Apple LaserWriter II series and HP LaserJet II/III, although those other printers only printed at 300x300 dpi. Some parts (such as the toner cartridge and input paper tray) are interchangeable with the LaserJet II/III. The printer used a proprietary high-speed serial interface, and was in essence a predecessor of the software-rendering approach, as it used the DisplayPostscript renderer in NeXTStep rather than a hardware PostScript renderer. Regardless of the lack of dedicated rendering hardware, it usually achieved close to its rated speed of 8 ppm, as the NeXTStation had a much faster CPU (25 or 33MHz 68040) and greater memory capacity (up to 128 MB in Turbo models) than the rendering engines of contemporary printers. Because NeXTStep used DisplayPostscript extensively in its windowing system, the PostScript rendering path was optimized; thus, printed documents had a true output WYSIWYG corresponding to the screen.

An authority on Rembrandt's drawings, he collected all of the known etchings made by Rembrandt during his career. Biography Lugt was a precocious connoisseur who made a catalog of his own Museum Lugtius at age eight. Encouraged by his father, he became an art expert at a young age and cut short his formal education in 1901 to become an employee at the auction house of Frederik Muller in Amsterdam. Lugt's marriage in 1910 to Jacoba Klever (1888-1969), a woman of independent means, meant that he could pursue his interests without financial concerns. By 1911 he had become a partner of the firm, a position he held until 1915. One of his tasks at the auction house was the compilation of auctioneers' sale catalogues. Though art history as an academic field did not exist, he made a difficult choice to focus on this, and gave up his budding art career. He began to collect art with his wife, travelling throughout Europe for this and focussing on masters of the Dutch Golden Age. Upon the death of his father-in-law in 1931, his wife inherited a sizeable fortune, which enabled the couple to expand their collecting interests. Research His ongoing interest resulted in the four volumes of his famous R√©pertoire des catalogues de ventes publiques int√©ressant l'art ou la curiosit√© (\\"Repertory of catalogues of public sale concerned with art or objets d'art\\") published in 1938, 1953, 1964, and (posthumously) 1987, which gives essential details of sales catalogues published during the years 1600‚Äì1925, held in public collections in Europe and North America. The \\"Lugt number\\" of a sale catalogue is a familiar reference. While he was still occupied with this project, he donated his huge collection of sale catalogues and other documentary materials to the Netherlands Institute for Art History (RKD) at The Hague along with his personal library, in the nature of a \\"permanent loan.\\" Collectors' marks In 1921, he completed his first work essential to art historians, Les marques de collections de dessins et d‚Äôestampes,Marques de Collections: (Dessins-Estampes), Marques estampill√©es et √©crites de collections particuli√®res et publiques. Marques de marchands, de monteurs et d‚Äôimprimeurs. Cachets de vente d‚Äôartistes d√©ced√©s. Marques de graveurs appos√©s apr√®s le triage des planches. Timbres d‚Äôedition.

In 1956 this first volume on collectors' marks was followed by a Suppl√©ment.Frits Lugt, \\"Les marques de collections de dessins & d'estampes\\", The Hague, 1956. In March 2010 the Fondation Custodia published an on-line edition of the two volumes by Lugt. This database is being regularly updated with new information and newly found marks: www.marquesdecollections.fr. Inventory catalogs for Paris collections In 1922 he was commissioned to compile the inventory catalogue of Dutch and Flemish drawings in the Mus√©e du Louvre. The first volume appeared in 1927, the series eventually comprising nine volumes cataloguing drawings of the Northern schools not only from the Louvre's collection but also in other collections in Paris, including the Petit Palais (the collection of Eug√®ne Dutuit), the Biblioth√®que Nationale, and the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. In 1932 he moved his family and growing art collection to the Lange Vijverberg in The Hague, in the house that now houses the Museum Bredius. This building was only a few hundred yards from the young Netherlands Institute for Art History, and across the Hofvijver from the Mauritshuis. Oberlin College When war threatened the Netherlands, the Lugts together sent the top pieces of their impressive collection of drawings, prints, books, and paintings in six packages to Switzerland. During the Second World War, the couple fled to the United States, where Wolfgang Stechow secured a temporary position for him lecturing at Oberlin College, Ohio. While in America Lugt was impressed by the number of public institutions founded by private bequests. After the war they returned to their home in The Hague by boat, accompanied by fifty chests of books, catalogs, journals, and reproductions, most of which he gave to the RKD. Together the husband and wife team proceeded to recover the parts of their collection that they had not previously sent to Switzerland and that had been seized by the German occupying forces. Fondation Custodia In the style of self-taught American philanthropists such as Andrew Carnegie, Lugt, whose devout Mennonite faith led him to consider their art collection part of God's gift, sought a cultural center which would make their collection accessible to the public: the result was the Fondation Custodia (1947), which continues to conserve the Lugt art collection, housed in the eighteenth-century H√¥tel Turgot, Rue de Lille, Paris. The next thing Lugt did was to arrange accommodation for a center devoted to scholarship and the arts in the Netherlands. After attempts to found this in their home on the Lange Vijverberg in The Hague, this became the Institut N√©erlandais in Paris (1957). Legacy Frits Lugt survived his wife by less than a year. In his sale catalog for the illustrious 18th-century art collector Pierre-Jean Mariette, he signed it as 'your very humble and very dutiful great-great-grandson'. He certainly managed to collect more art than Mariette. At the time he died, the Lugt collection consisted of about six thousand drawings, thirty thousand prints, and two hundred paintings. His research is preserved in the databases of the RKD, while much of his art is still preserved in Paris.

The Mitsubishi Fuso Rosa was launched in 1960 and is now in its fourth generation. In Japan, Asia-Pacific, Mid-East, Africa, Jamaica and South America, its principal competitors are the Isuzu Journey, Nissan Civilian, Mazda Parkway and Toyota Coaster. History The Mitsubishi Rosa was launched in 1960 by the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (formerly China-Japan Heavy Industries) and was called Mitsubishi Rosa. In 1964, three companies merged with the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to become a new Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, and the Mitsubishi Rosa became a Mitsubishi Fuso product to replace the Fuso MB720 minibus in 1966.  First generation (1960-1973) 1959 Fuso Rosa (First generation) Mitsubishi officially launched the Rosa minibus in 1960. At that time, the factory was coded as B10 and developed from the chassis of the original Mitsubishi Jupiter T10 truck Mitsubishi Light Bus Genealogy. Its body style is similar to the Mercedes-Benz O 319 minibus, with a length of approximately 5.4 meters. In the following year (1961), Mitsubishi evolved to B20 on the basis of B10, which is an extended version of B10, which ranges from 6.25 to 7 meters in length.  Second generation (1973-1986) In 1973 Mitsubishi released the second generation, which is similar as the first generation, the main difference is the design of the front has been largely revised, and a large number of components can be shared with the Mitsubishi trucks. In the beginning, there was BC2 (short-range gasoline version), BE2 (short-range diesel version) and BH2 (long-range diesel version). In 1981, the BK2 series was introduced (long-range version with a width of 2.3 meters).

The most prominent change was the newly designed body, which introduced a large number of ergonomic designs. Like the previous two generations, the third generation minibus Rosa has short (6.2 meters long) and long (6.95 meters long) versions, but both only have engines of four cylinders. As for the headlights have a round or square lamp version, some of which are equipped with command lights on the side of the vehicle. In 1990, Mitsubishi Rosa received a facelift, the distance between the two headlights was extended and the command light on the vehicle side was installed. They also offered automatic transmission, independent shock absorber and reclining seats options. It was at this time that Rosa added a four-wheel drive version for the first timeMitsubishi Fuso Rosa Bus.

During the Roman era it was called Colonia Sarnensis Milevitana, after the River Sarnus in Campania, whence the colonists had emigrated. This name is often found in the inscriptions of the city. Together with Cirta, Collo and Rusicade, Milevum formed the confederation known as the Four Colonies, the territory of which was very extensive. In the 6th century the Byzantine Emperor Justinian had Milevum enclosed by a fortified wall, which still stands and forms a rampart for the Muslim city of Mila.Ch.

Two church councils were held at Milevum, one in 402 and the other in 416. The second appealed to Pope Innocent I for repression of the Pelagian heresy.

With this background, Luna was cast in a variety of Hispanic and ethnic roles.https://www.thespectrum.com/story/entertainment/2016/03/10/barbara- lunas-stellar-career/81439290/ BarBara was introduced to Broadway shows early in life. She was tapped by Rodgers and Hammerstein to play Ngana, the daughter of Emile de Becque, the French plantation owner played by Ezio Pinza in the original Broadway production of South Pacific, in which she helped sing the show's opening song, Dites-Moi. She next appeared in The King and I as one of the Siamese children, advancing to the more important role of \\"Royal Dancer\\" by the time the show closed on Broadway. Not wishing to drop out of school to go on the road, she auditioned for and won the understudy role of Lotus Blossom in Teahouse of the August Moon. A few months later, after graduating from high school, she was given the starring role of Lotus Blossom in Teahouse and toured with the show's company for three years. Director Mervyn LeRoy saw her performance as Lotus Blossom in Los Angeles and cast her to play Camille, the blind girl who was Frank Sinatra's love interest in The Devil at 4 O'Clock. This led to roles in other films including Meli in Firecreek, as Amparo in Ship of Fools, as Cat in The Concrete Jungle, and as Makia in Five Weeks in a Balloon. Opportunities in television came as well. Luna has appeared in some 500 television series, including Walt Disney's Zorro, where she was a recurring character in the \\"Joaquin\\" arc as Theresa, the Tamale Peddler, the role of Rikki Stevens in the 1958 Perry Mason episode, \\"The Case of the Sardonic Sergeant\\", The Wild Wild West as Gatita, The Big Valley as Miranda (1968), Gunsmoke as Chavela (in \\"He Learned About Women\\" Episode 21 Season 7), Overland Trail as Estrelita (in episode \\"Mission to Mexico\\"), Bonanza as Cayetena Losaro, The Outer Limits as Gaby Christian, The Invaders as Lisa, Hawaiian Eye in three episodes: \\"The Koa Man\\" as Susan Chang, \\"Sword of the Samurai\\" as Michiko and \\"Payoff\\" as Tia Kuno, Hawaii Five-O in two episodes \\"A Thousand Pardons, You're Dead\\" as Yoko Collins and \\"A Lion in the Streets\\" as Elena Kamoku, Buck Rogers in the 25th Century as Koori, Dallas as Carmen Esperanza, Charlie's Angels as Cynthia Weaver and two guest starring roles on the original Mission: Impossible, as well as a guest starring role in the 1980s remake of that series. One of her better-known roles was Lt. Marlena Moreau in the \\"Mirror, Mirror\\" episode of Star Trek: The Original Series (1967) ‚Äì a role she still commemorates as a guest of Star Trek conventions worldwide. She has also had roles in the television soap operas Search for Tomorrow and One Life to Live. As Maria Roberts on One Life to Live, her character was involved in the kidnapping of baby Jessica Buchannan, a plot device which was revisited years after Maria's accidental death after being caught by Tina trying to kill Vicky. The actress also appeared as Marnya on The Man from U.N.C.L.E. episode \\"The Man from THRUSH Affair\\". Between film commitments, Luna remained active in musicals. She appeared as Anita in five companies of West Side Story, including a revival at Lincoln Center in New York City. Her last Broadway show was A Chorus Line in the role of Diana Morales (in the \\"New\\" New York cast in 1976). This performance led to the preparation of a cabaret act for her. Its opening night, at Freddie's in New York City, drew rave reviews and led to engagements at the Concord Hotel in the Catskills and at clubs in Atlantic City and Los Angeles.

It is operated and managed by Australian property investment company, General Property Trust (GPT). It is of local importance and is used by much of the Illawarra community as a social and shopping centre. It is situated in the western half of the Crown Street Mall. Centre Information Whilst Wollongong Central today is one complete shopping centre, it was originally two separate and distinct shopping centres. Crown Central shopping centre was constructed and opened in 1975 by the Abbey Capital Property Group on the northern side of Crown Street, taking the majority of the Crown Street frontage between Keira Street and Church Street. In 1986, a joint venture between Wollongong City Council and Kern Corporation developed the Crown Gateway shopping centre on the site of the former Coles Building on the southern side of Crown Street, extending through to Burelli Street. In the late 1990s, Crown Central was purchased by the GPT Group, and a short period later, GPT acquired Crown Gateway from Wollongong City Council. GPT then developed a pedestrian bridge to join the two centres, and re-branded the combined complex as Wollongong Central.\\"Wollongong City Library - Suburb profiles: Wollongong\\" Retrieved on 29 June 2013.\\"Crown Street Mall - 25 Years of History\\" Illawarra Mercury, Wollongong, 19 September 2011. Retrieved on 29 June 2013. The centre currently features a David Jones department store and approximately 140 stores in the centre itself. In addition, there are also around 300 other retail outlets in the adjacent Crown Street Mall, which Wollongong Central is part of. Wollongong Central underwent a $200 million redevelopment. The redevelopment expanded the centre's GLA (Gross Lettable Area) from to , making it the largest shopping centre in the Illawarra region.Wollongong Central Redevelopment On 9 October 2014, a new three-storey building named West Keira was opened. =Buildings= West Keira building. West Keira (Building 1) is situated on the corner of Keira Street and Crown Street and has three main floors. It joins to North Building via an underground pathway and pedestrian bridge. Lower ground floor contains Coles and the first floor contains Target and JB Hi-Fi. The building also contains cafes and restaurants outside along Keira Street. North Building (Building 2, formerly Crown Central) has two main floors, and unlike South Building is at street level to Crown Street Mall. The ground floor features H&M; clothing store, and the first floor features mini-major Rebel Sport. South Building (Building 3, formerly Crown Gateway) has three main floors. Rivers and TK Maxx occupies part of the bottom level, which opens to Burelli Street to the south at ground level. The upper two levels are primarily accessed from Crown Street Mall and predominantly contain specialty stores, fashion outlets, and cafes. Myer previously occupied all three levels, which has been renovated in 2017 to now instead occupy David Jones and Holey Moley Golf Club - a bar and mini golf venue. A pedestrian bridge links South Building to North Building. There is also a pedestrian bridge linking South Building to Club Lime and a carpark. On top of the south-western corner of the North Building is a five-level office tower, previously known as Crown Tower. At Christmas, Easter and other festivities the mall is decorated, and flagpoles show banners in the mall below. Current Development Plans =North Building Renovations= In 2009, the North building underwent extensive $20 million interior renovations which completely revamped the interior of the building, giving it a much more modern and classier look.

Production and consumption Ch·∫£ l·ª•a has been incorporated into Thai cuisine under the name moo yor, and is widely eaten all over Thailand. Here it is shown with a som tam style dressing. Traditionally, ch·∫£ l·ª•a is made of lean pork, potato starch, garlic, ground black pepper, and fish sauce. The pork has to be pounded until it becomes pasty; it cannot be chopped or ground, as the meat would still be fibrous, dry, and crumbly. Near the end of the pounding period, a few spoonfuls of fish paste are added to the meat for flavor, but salt, black pepper, and sugar can also be added. The meat is now called gi√≤ s·ªëng, meaning \\"raw sausage\\", and can be used in other dishes, as well. The mixture is then wrapped tightly in banana leaves into a cylindrical shape and boiled. If the banana leaf is not wrapped tightly and water leaks inside while it is being boiled, the sausage will spoil quickly if kept at room temperature. The sausage has to be submerged vertically into boiling water, and a 1-kg sausage typically takes an hour to cook. Other variants include: * ch·∫£ b√¨ - containing shredded pork skin along with typical ch·∫£ l·ª•a ingredients, then steamed * ch·∫£ b√≤ - beef sausage with herbs * ch·∫£ chi√™n - where the entire sausage is deep- fried (instead of steamed, omitting the banana leaf wrap) * ch·∫£ Hu·∫ø - contains whole black peppercorns and more garlic and then steamed * ch·∫£ qu·∫ø - sausage seasoned with powdered cinnamon, then fried, another variety of ch·∫£ chi√™n. In Northern Vietnam, ch·∫£ almost exclusively refers to this variant Correctly made ch·∫£ l·ª•a can be stored at room temperature for about one week, but it is recommended to keep it refrigerated until used, where it can be stored for up to 3‚Äì4 weeks. During the initial wave of Vietnamese immigrants to the United States in the mid-1970s, banana leaves were difficult to find; thus, Vietnamese chefs substituted aluminum foil for banana leaves, a habit that continues today. In areas that have banana leaves, a small strip of it is used for flavor while still using the aluminum foil to shape the sausage. The sausage is normally sliced and eaten with b√°nh cu·ªën, b√°nh m√¨, or x√¥i, or braised in fish sauce and black pepper with other meat dishes. If fried, it is called ch·∫£ chi√™n. Ch·∫£ l·ª•a also known as moo yor in Thai, the term is a combination of the word moo, meaning pork, and the word gi√≤ which means ham or sausage in Vietnamese.

Initially the school's board consisted of representatives from the three local municipalities (Shire of Gisborne, Shire of Romsey and Shire of Newham and Woodend - now replaced by the newer Shire of Macedon Ranges) and the three local Christian denomination churches (Anglican, Catholic and Uniting). The school's motto is Unum Corpus Multi Sumus (One body, many parts).  Braemar House  Braemar House, Mt Macedon 1895 - source NLA The main building in the college, Braemar House, dates from the late nineteenth century and is believed to be the largest plywood structure in the Southern Hemisphere. Braemar House is a substantial two-storey timber mansion on brick and stone foundations with high pitched roofs, intricate gables and asymmetric features, which was constructed in 1889-90 to a design by Italian-born architect Louis Boldini. The school's architectural style is classified as Victorian Period (1851‚Äì1901) Free Classical. Braemar House was built as a guest house for affluent Melbourne residents by a consortium of Melbourne businessmen. The location of Braemar House in the Mount Macedon area which was noted for its bracing mountain air made it attractive to those who believed that city life was not conducive to good health and that regular vacations in a healthy environment would restore well being. Access to rail transport and proximity to recreational activities such as walking and climbing in picturesque locations such as nearby Hanging Rock made Woodend a suitable place for such a venture. Braemar House operated as a guest house from about 1890 until at least 1908, and possibly until 1918 when it was reported sold and that \\"it is intended to convert the house into a school for young ladies\\". Braemar House was listed on the Heritage Register of Victoria in 2003.  Clyde School  Clyde School was founded as a private girls' school in 1910 in St Kilda by Isabel Henderson. In 1919 it moved to Braemar House, Woodend and in 1921 it was transformed into a public school (which was exclusively a boarding school). In 1976 Clyde School, Geelong Church of England Grammar School, and Geelong Church of England Girls' Grammar School \\"The Hermitage\\" amalgamated, and today the combined school continues as Geelong Grammar School.  Braemar College  In 1975 the present name Braemar College was adopted as a new school was started to include years 7 to 12 for both male and female students. Its original principal was Graham Farley. Braemar College sits surrounded by the ferny undergrowth, Snow Gums, Alpine Ash and Mountain Ash bushland of the Macedon Regional Park. On 16 February 1983, the school escaped relatively unharmed as the infamous Ash Wednesday fires raged around it. The statewide Ash Wednesday Bushfires raged across Victoria - scorching 295 km¬≤ of bushland, taking 7 lives and destroying 628 buildings in the Macedon Ranges area alone. Despite the valiant efforts of local firefighters and volunteers, the school did lose its historic stables and grandstand - now the site of a gymnasium and theatre building. The fire that burnt the stables took place on 1 February 1983, a fortnight before the Ash Wednesday fires. The college again expanded in 1995 with the construction of a primary school building along with full provisions for grade 5 and 6 students. In 2017, work on the Braemar College Woodend Campus began. The College has timelines in place that will see the Middle School being located at the second campus for the commencement of term 2 of 2018, but because of delays, the Middle School is now been transferred to the second campus at the beginning of the 3rd term. Braemar College participates in many activities with other schools in the region such as cross country, athletics, swimming, chess, debating and orienteering. References in media Clyde School became well known for its depiction in the Joan Lindsay novel Picnic at Hanging Rock (1967). This novel was concerned with an ill-fated excursion to nearby Hanging Rock by girls from the local boarding school. In 1975 the novel was made into a film directed by Peter Weir which became very successful both in Australia and overseas. At the time of release, the association with Clyde School was noted in the press. The film's producers chose Martindale Hall, in South Australia (with school buildings more typical of a 19th-century English public school than the former alpine chalet styled guesthouse) to stand for the story's fictional school, Appleyard College. In 1987, the final chapter or sequel to Picnic at Hanging Rock titled The Secret of Hanging Rock, was launched at a media event at Braemar College. In 1987, The Australian 60 Minutes program televised a debate at the school on the abortion issue featuring students and community figures on either side of the debate (including notorious pro-life campaigner Margaret Tighe).

He soon took up his lucrative legal practice as a defence advocate and later as a politician in the state of Victoria. Aspinall was one of the chief counsel for the leaders of the Ballarat Riots, also known as Eureka Stockade, and later defended Henry James O'Farrell for the attempted assassination of Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh. He was briefly appointed as Attorney-General in 1861 and Solicitor-General in 1870. Aspinall died in April 1875 in Liverpool, England. Biography and career The son of the Reverend James Aspinall, Butler Cole Aspinall was born in Liverpool, Lancashire, England, in 1830, educated for the law, and was called to the Bar in 1853. He engaged in newspaper work, contributing to the Morning Chronicle and other London papers. In 1854, he came to Melbourne as a law reporter for The Argus, and also contributed to the Morning Herald, Age, and Melbourne Punch. He soon began to practise as a barrister and gained a great reputation as an advocate, and as a wit and humorist. =Eureka Stockade trial= In February 1855, Aspinall was one of the counsel for the leaders of the Eureka Rebellion. =Politics= In 1856, Aspinall was elected a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly for Talbot. He also represented Castlemaine (1859‚Äì60), Geelong East (1861‚Äì64), Portland (1866‚Äì67) and St Kilda (1868‚Äì1870). At the end of July 1861 he became Attorney-General in the Richard Heales ministry, but the cabinet resigned a few weeks later. He resigned as member for St Kilda on 1 January 1870, was appointed Solicitor-General in the John MacPherson ministry, on 19 January 1870, before resigning on 9 April 1870 with the rest of the ministry. =Court practice= Aspinall was a first-rate advocate and a good parliamentary debater, but he broke down when 40 years old, an age when most men are scarcely past the beginning of their career. He had much charm of manner, and stories of his wit and humour were still being told in legal circles 70 years after his death. The Dictionary of Australian Biography quotes one example of his inspired impudence, which arose out of a brush with a Victorian judge. =Henry James O'Farrell trial= In 1868 Aspinall defended Henry James O'Farrell at Sydney for the attempted assassination of Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, and from January to April 1870 he was solicitor-general in the John Alexander MacPherson ministry. Towards the end of this year he resigned his seat in parliament, and in 1871 had a mental breakdown and was confined for some time. On recovering he returned to England and died there on 4 April 1875. He was married and his wife, who had been left in Melbourne, died six days later. Personal life A son, also called Butler Cole Aspinall, who was educated in England, became a London barrister and an authority on shipping law. He died unmarried in London on 15 November 1935.The Times, 16 November 1935 References * J. H. Heaton, Australian Dictionary of Dates; * J. L.

Etymology The Latin species name boeticus refers to Baetica, a province of the Roman Empire in the Iberian Peninsula . Its common name refers to the long streamers on its hind wings, the male‚Äôs bright iridescent blue colour, and peas, which is the typical host plant of the butterfly. Distribution This species can be found in Europe, Africa, South and Southeast Asia, and Australia.Funet Habitat This species inhabits the edge of forests, mountain meadows and hot flowery places at an elevation up to above sea level. Lepidoptera CaucasiSimon Coombes Captain's European Butterfly Guide Description The wingspan is 24‚Äì32 mm for males and 24‚Äì34 mm for females. In these small butterflies (although unusually large for their family) the males have a mainly blue violet upper face of the wings with the brown edges, while the females have only a small amount of blue colour in the centre of the wings (sexual dimorphism).New Zealand Butterflies Both sexes have a thin, long tail in the hindwings and two black spots in the anal angle. The underface of the wings is ocher and adorned with white markings and with a larger white submarginal streak.Euro Butterflies by Matt Rowlings The underface of each hindwing shows a pair of small black eye-spots beside each tail, with an orange marginal spots at the anal angle. This species is rather similar and it can be confused with Leptotes pirithous and Cacyreus marshalli although the pea-blue is significantly larger than both species. Female of Lampides boeticus Ecology This species may have three generations a year. Adults fly from February to early November and are strong migrants. Eggs are white with a greenish tinge and have a disc-shaped form. They can reach a diameter of 0.5 mm. They are laid singly on the flower buds of the host plants. Old caterpillars are green or reddish-brown, with dark dorsal stripe. They reach a length of 14-15 mm. Pupae reach a length of 9-10 mm. They are light grayish- brown with medium-sized dark spots and dark dorsal stripe. The larvae feed on flowers, seeds and pods of many Fabaceae species, including Medicago, Crotalaria, Polygala, Sutherlandia, Dolichos, Cytisus, Spartium and Lathyrus species. It has also been recorded on Crotolaria pallida.Kunte, K. 2006. Additions to the known larval host plants of Indian butterflies.

The Republicans intended to prevent political activity of ex-Confederate soldiers and supporters by requiring all voters and officials to swear they had never supported the Confederacy. Given the temporary disenfranchisement of the numerous Confederate veterans and local civic leaders, a new Republican biracial coalition came to power in the eleven Southern states during Reconstruction. Southern conservative Democrats were angered to have been disenfranchised.  Text of the Oath   Role during Civil War  Congress originally devised the Oath in July 1862 for all federal employees, lawyers and federal elected officials. It was applied to Southern voters in the Wade‚ÄìDavis Bill of 1864, which President Abraham Lincoln vetoed. Former vice- president Andrew Johnson also opposed it after he became president in April 1865. Both Johnson and Lincoln wanted Southerners instead to swear to an oath that in the future they would support the Union. Lincoln's amnesty oath was integral to his ten percent plan for reconstruction. In 1864 Congress extended the provisions of the Ironclad Oath to its own members, but overlooked perjury when it came to seating Southern Republicans.  Role in Reconstruction  The Oath was a key factor in removing many ex-Confederates from the political arena during the Reconstruction era of the late 1860s. To take the Ironclad Oath, a person had to swear he had never borne arms against the Union or supported the Confederacy ‚Äî that is, he had \\"never voluntarily borne arms against the United States,\\" had \\"voluntarily\\" given \\"no aid, countenance, counsel or encouragement\\" to persons in rebellion and had exercised or attempted to exercise the functions of no office under the Confederacy. A farmer who sold grain to the Confederate Army would be covered. The oath was detested by ex-Confederates; some called it \\"The Damnesty Oath.\\"William A. Blair, Cities of the Dead: Contesting the Memory of the Civil War in the South, 1865‚Äì1914 (2004), pp. 67‚Äì68 Congress devised the oath in July 1862 for all federal employees, lawyers, and federal elected officials. It was applied to Southern voters in the Wade‚ÄìDavis Bill of 1864, which President Abraham Lincoln vetoed. President Andrew Johnson also opposed it. Both Johnson and Lincoln wanted Southerners instead to swear to an oath that in the future they would support the Union. Lincoln's amnesty oath was integral to his ten percent plan for reconstruction. In 1864 Congress extended the provisions of the ironclad oath to its own members, but overlooked perjury when it came to seating Southern Republicans. Historian Harold Hyman says that in 1866, Northern Congressmen \\"described the oath as the last bulwark against the return of ex-rebels to power, the barrier behind which Southern Unionists and Negroes protected themselves.\\"Harold Hyman, To try men's souls: Loyalty Tests in American History (1959), p 93 The first Supplemental Reconstruction Act (March 23, 1867) required an oath of past loyalty in order for any man in the South to vote. The local registrar had to swear that he had never held office under Confederacy, nor given aid or comfort to it. They also had to take the ironclad oath.Hyman, To try men's souls (1959) p 125 In 1867 the United States Supreme Court held that the federal ironclad oath for attorneys and the similar Missouri state oath for ministers, teachers, and other professionals were unconstitutional, because they violated the constitutional prohibitions against bills of attainder and ex post facto laws.Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277 (1867); Ex parte Garland, 4 Wall. 333 (1867).Hyman, To try men's souls (1959), p 261 In March 1867 Radicals in Congress passed a law that prohibited anyone from voting in the election of delegates to state constitutional conventions or in the subsequent ratification who was prohibited from holding office under section 3 of the pending Fourteenth Amendment.The Amendment provided, \\"No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.\\" Those exclusions were less inclusive than the requirements of the Ironclad Oath. These exclusions allowed the Republican coalitions to carry the elections in every Southern state except Virginia. The Republican-dominated legislatures wrote and enacted new constitutions. These new state constitutions applied to all state officials and could not be repealed by an ordinary vote of the legislature. The Republicans applied the oath in the South to keep political opponents from holding office or (in some states) from even voting.William L. Richter, The Army in Texas during Reconstruction, 1865‚Äì1870 (1987) pp. 97‚Äì98 Hyman says, \\"most Southerners, even good Republican supporters, were disfranchised by the ironclad oath's blanket provisions rather than by the Fourteenth Amendment's highly selective disabilities.\\"Hyman, To try men's souls: Loyalty Tests in American History (1959) p 264 Perman emphasizes that the Republican ascendancy in the South was \\"extremely precarious\\" because the electorate had been defined by Congress, and \\"many potential opponents had been disfranchised, while others have simply refused to participate in what they regarded as a rigged election.\\"Michael Perman, The Road to Redemption: Southern Politics 1869‚Äì1879 (1984), pp. 23‚Äì24 Perman argues that while the Radicals had controlled the state constitutional conventions, they increasingly lost power inside the Republican Party to conservative forces that repudiated disfranchisement and proscription. Voters in Texas, Virginia, and Mississippi voted down the new constitutions even though many opponents were disfranchised. The result was that by 1870 in every state except Arkansas, the Republicans dropped the restrictions against ex-Confederates and supporters, such as the ironclad oath. In Arkansas the Republican split, leading to an armed conflict called the Brooks‚ÄìBaxter War.Perman, The Road to Redemption (1984) pp. 26‚Äì27 In 1871, Congress modified the ironclad oath in order to permit all former rebels to use the 1868 formula to swear to \\"future loyalty.\\" President Ulysses S. Grant vetoed the law, but Congress passed it.Hyman, To try men's souls (1959) p 264 Voting restrictions on former Confederates varied state by state during the rest of the Reconstruction era. Few were disenfranchised in Georgia, Texas, Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina. Alabama and Arkansas banned only those ineligible to hold office under the Fourteenth Amendment. Louisiana banned those newspaper editors and religious ministers who had supported secession or anybody who had voted for the secession ordinance, but allowed them to vote if they took an oath favoring Radical Reconstruction, a much more lenient avowal than required by the Ironclad Oath.Eric Foner, Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution (1988) p. 324 In states where there was disenfranchisement the maximum percentage was 10‚Äì20% of otherwise eligible white voters; most states had much smaller percentages disenfranchised.David Donald, Jean Harvey Baker and Michael F. Holt, The Civil War and Reconstruction. (2000) p. 580 In the South the most support for the Ironclad Oath came from white Republicans from the hill counties, where they needed it to gain local majorities.Foner, Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution (1988) p. 324 In May 1884, President Chester Arthur signed the law repealing the remaining ironclad and jurors' test-oath statutes.Hyman, To try men's souls (1959) p. 265  See also  *Redeemers  Notes   References  * Belz, Herman.

Such an approach is intended to reduce the overhead of packet receiving. The idea is to defer incoming message handling until there is a sufficient amount of them so that it is worth handling them all at once. Motivation A straightforward method of implementing a network driver is to interrupt the kernel by issuing an interrupt request (IRQ) for each and every incoming packet. However, servicing IRQs is costly in terms of processor resources and time. Therefore, the straightforward implementation can be very inefficient in high-speed networks, constantly interrupting the kernel with the thousands of packets per second. Overall performance of the system as well as network throughput can suffer as a result. Polling is an alternative to interrupt-based processing. The kernel can periodically check for the arrival of incoming network packets without being interrupted, which eliminates the overhead of interrupt processing. Establishing an optimal polling frequency is important, however. Too frequent polling wastes CPU resources by repeatedly checking for incoming packets that have not yet arrived. On the other hand, polling too infrequently introduces latency by reducing system reactivity to incoming packets, and it may result in the loss of packets if the incoming packet buffer fills up before being processed. As a compromise, the Linux kernel uses the interrupt-driven mode by default and only switches to polling mode when the flow of incoming packets exceeds a certain threshold, known as the \\"weight\\" of the network interface. Compliant drivers A driver using the NAPI interface will work as follow: * Packet receive interrupts are disabled. * The driver provides a poll method to the kernel. That method will fetch all incoming packets available, on the network card or a DMA ring, so that they will then be handled by the kernel. * When allowed to, the kernel calls the device poll method to possibly handle many packets at once. Advantages * The load induced by interrupts is reduced even though the kernel has to poll. * Packets are less likely to be re-ordered, while out of order packet handling might be a bottleneck otherwise. * In case the kernel is unable to handle all incoming packets, the kernel does not have to do any work in order to drop them: they are simply overwritten in the network card's incoming ring buffer. Without NAPI, the kernel has to handle every incoming packet regardless of whether there is time to service it, which leads to thrashing. History NAPI was an over-three- year effort by Alexey Kuznetsov, Jamal Hadi Salim and Robert Olsson. Initial effort to include NAPI was met with resistance by some members of the community, however David Miller worked hard to ensure NAPI's inclusion. A lot of real world testing was done in the Uppsala university network before inclusion. In fact, www.slu.se was the first production NAPI-based OS and is still powered to this day by NAPI-based Bifrost/Linux routers. The pktgen traffic generator was also born around this time. Pktgen was extensively used to test NAPI scenarios not induced by real world traffic. References Further reading * The classical NAPI paper.

The centre is currently anchored by Target and Kmart discount department stores, Coles supermarket, Aldi Food Store, an 8-screen Event Cinema and more than 140 specialty stores including Lincraft, Witchery, Sportsgirl and Pillow Talk. The centre opened on 11 October 1967 by The Westfield Group. Over the years it has been remodelled from its original form with several extensions, the most recent being a new dining and entertainment precinct upgrade on the second level. Toombul was the largest shopping centre on Brisbane's northside until Westfield Chermside's redevelopment in 1999-2000. History In the mid 1960s, The Westfield Group was looking to expand interstate into Queensland. Co-founder of Westfield, Frank Lowy sent his brother John and an engineer to the state to scout for potential sites in Brisbane. A local real estate agent, Donald Petrie, showed them the current site, located on a flood plain with a creek flowing through it in a growing area of the city. Later, the Westfield founders travelled to Brisbane to inspect the site. Realising the commercial potential of the area, the company purchased the property. To overcome the flooding issues, Westfield employed experts at a local university to develop a plan. The solution was to fill and raise one half of the site to build the centre and construct a bridge across the creek. There were also problems finding a department store to anchor the centre and filling the specialty retail spaces at the centre. As Toombul was close to the Chermside Shopping Centre, which was anchored by a department store, other department stores were cautious about opening so close. Another problem was Westfield was an unknown developer outside of New South Wales, making it hard to attract retailers. Frank Lowy and Donald Petrie resorted to walking the streets of Brisbane's CBD to find retailers to occupy the centre. It paid off as the centre was 100% leased at opening. Due to Westfield's relationship with Coles (having built some Coles stores in Sydney), the retailer was committed from the beginning of the development to opening a store at the centre. The centre opened as Westfield Shopping Town Toombul on Wednesday 11 October 1967. It was originally anchored by a Barry and Roberts Department store, Coles supermarket, Bayards store and 60 specialty stores. It was the first shopping centre in Brisbane built with air- conditioning (Chermside was converted in 1965) and had off-street parking for up to 1500 vehicles. One of its main features was a water fountain previously located within the current western entrance. By the early 1970s, the Bayards store had closed down leaving room for another anchor to open at the centre. Westfield had negotiated a deal with David Jones to open a store at Toombul. This was an unusual move for the retailer at the time as they had their own development and construction company and only opened suburban stores in their own 'Garden City' shopping centres. The 2 level David Jones department store opened in 1972 and was the first extension for the centre. It was also the first David Jones store to open in a Westfield owned shopping centre. For a brief time in the 1970s, Toombul was anchored by 2 Department stores, a rarity for an Australian shopping centre at the time. Sometime in the 1970s a single screen cinema opened at the centre, the second extension to the centre. By the mid 1970s, Barry and Roberts had closed down their Toombul store, leaving David Jones as the sole department store anchor. In 1978 the discount department store chain Target had opened a store in part of the former Barry and Roberts store. A food court was also opened at this time. A street and 2 residential blocks adjoining the centre were bought in the late 1970s and construction of the third major extension began. In 1980, the extension opened with a new mall, bus station, extension to the second level of David Jones, Best & Less and Kmart discount department store. The total number of specialty stores at the centre increased to over 140. In 1982, the Target store closed down and was replaced by McDonnell & East two years later, giving the centre two department stores once again. McDonnell & East closed in 1987 due to its over-expansion strategy leaving David Jones, Kmart and Coles as the anchors. The fourth major extension opened in 1989 on the part of the site occupied by the former Barry and Roberts store. The extension added a BI-LO supermarket and new specialty stores on the lower level and an 8 screen hoyts multiplex cinema the 1st in not in the city plus a new food court and Sizzler restaurant on the upper mezzanine level. The rest of the centre was refurbished along with this extension. The 1990s were probably Westfield Toombul's last successful decade, and by the early 1990s, it was the largest shopping centre on Brisbane's northside and the only centre on the northside with a multiplex cinema. The number of specialty stores at the centre totalled over 180. The centre held this title until 1999 when the redeveloped Westfield Chermside opened. Although the now much larger Chermside centre didn't greatly affect the retail trade of Toombul, it did affect the trade of the cinema. The more modern, larger 16 screen Birch, Carroll and Coyle multiplex with Gold Class cinemas and entertainment precinct built at Chermside drew much of its clientele from the same catchment area as the Toombul multiplex, with many preferring to go to Chermside. After the redevelopment of Chermside completed in 2000, Toombul became overlooked by Westfield, with the company preferring to focus on promoting the upgraded Chermside centre. In 2003, the external facade was modernised, a new bus station constructed and an outdoor dining precinct was added where the former bus station was located. The famous \\"big T\\" sign, first erected on centre's opening in 1967, was dismantled. This was the last construction work done by Westfield. In July 2003, the centre was acquired by the Centro Properties Group in a stock trade deal involving Toombul and other Westfield properties in exchange for Centro's interest in the AMP Shopping Centre Trust. As a result, the centre changed its name from Westfield Toombul to Centro Toombul. In 2005, Centro announced a 2-stage extension to the centre. The first stage added an Aldi Food Store, Fresh Life fresh food mall and additional specialty stores. The second stage of expansion (which never commenced) was to add Diner's Life food court on the ground level and convert the old cinemas into a rooftop carpark. This stage was originally intended to be complete by November 2006. Around this period, the future of the centre looked uncertain, due to increased competition from rival centres at Chermside, Nundah and Brisbane Airport, as well as due to the aging superstructure of the building itself. Much of the blame for the decline, even while the surrounding area is booming, has been laid at the feet of Centro citing poor management practices. On 21 August 2008, it was announced that Centro Toombul was for sale. On 20 July 2010, David Jones announced that it would terminate its lease at Centro Toombul ending the store's 35-year-long relationship with the centre. The store space was taken over by discount department store Target after David Jones closed on 29 January 2011.http://cfd.net.au/home/article/target-replaces-david-jones-at-toombul- shopping-centre-20100720-63735.html In May 2011, a new small food court opened on the ground level near centre court. The new food court houses 5 outlets including a Subway. On 6 October 2011, Target opened at Toombul. The 6,574 square metre store features the full suite of Target‚Äôs new store design which includes a co-ordinated women‚Äôs fashion area with a major boulevard for accessories, a beauty shop in the middle of the store with a cosmetics bar for makeovers and a state of the art home entertainment department. In August 2012 the 8-Screen Multiplex Cinema reopened with new furnishings (after closing in 2007). It is operated by be Event Cinemas. In November 2013, the centre was re-branded to 'Toombul' to reflect the rebranding of Centro Properties Group as Federation Centres in January 2013. In June 2015, the former Bilo store (Also known briefly as the 2nd Coles store) closed leaving only one full supermarket in the centre. In March 2016 it was announced that a new format Bunnings will open first half 2017 in Coles/Bilo's old position. In May 2016 the centre was acquired by Mirvac. Mirvac's short term plans for the centre include improvements to the car parks convenience and enhancing the retail offering to better align with changing trade area demographics. Medium to long term plans include the potential to deliver a new entertainment offering and dining precinct. In November 2019 Upstairs Toombul opened. Upstairs Toombul is a 4500sqm dining precinct situated on level 2 (where the old foodcourt/Lincraft was located) anchored by an Archie Brothers and over 12 new dining establishments. This opening also coincides with other upgrades around the centre including the Fashion mall, the Kmart Mall, the food court, the fresh food market as well as introduction of many new tenancies. The future is looking bright again for Toombul.

It may precede a migraine headache, but can also occur acephalgically (without headache). It is often confused with retinal migraine, which originates in the eyeball or socket. Signs and symptoms An artist's depiction of a scintillating scotoma with a bilateral arc. Many variations occur, but scintillating scotoma usually begins as a spot of flickering light near or in the center of the visual field, which prevents vision within the scotoma area. It typically affects both eyes, as it is not a problem specific to one eye. The affected area flickers but is not dark. It then gradually expands outward from the initial spot. Vision remains normal beyond the borders of the expanding scotoma(s), with objects melting into the scotoma area background similarly to the physiological blind spot, which means that objects may be seen better by not looking directly at them in the early stages when the spot is in or near the center. The scotoma area may expand to completely occupy one half of the visual area, or it may also be bilateral. It may occur as an isolated symptom without headache in acephalgic migraine. In teichopsia, migraine sufferers see patterns in the shape of the walls of a star fort. As the scotoma area expands, some people perceive only a bright flickering area that obstructs normal vision, while others describe seeing various patterns. Some describe seeing one or more shimmering arcs of white or colored flashing lights. An arc of light may gradually enlarge, become more obvious, and may take the form of a definite zigzag pattern, sometimes called a fortification spectrum (i.e. teichopsia, from Greek œÑŒµ·øñœáŒøœÇ, town wall), because of its resemblance to the fortifications of a castle or fort seen from above. It also can resemble the dazzle camouflage patterns used on ships in World War I. Others describe patterns within the arc as resembling Widmanst√§tten patterns. The visual anomaly results from abnormal functioning of portions of the occipital cortex at the back of the brain, not in the eyes nor any component thereof, such as the retinas. This is a different disease from retinal migraine, which is monocular (only one eye). It may be difficult to read and dangerous to drive a vehicle while the scotoma is present. Normal central vision may return several minutes before the scotoma disappears from peripheral vision. Sufferers can keep a diary of dates on which the episodes occur to show to their physician, plus a small sketch of the anomaly, which may vary between episodes.

File:Scintillating scotoma interpretation.gifA depiction of a scintillating scotoma that was almost spiral-shaped, with distortion of shapes but otherwise melting into the background similarly to the physiological blind spot. Causes Scintillating scotomas are most commonly caused by cortical spreading depression, a pattern of changes in the behavior of nerves in the brain during a migraine. Migraines, in turn, may be caused by genetic influences and hormones. People with migraines often self-report triggers for migraines involving stress or foods, Alternate version: or bright lights. While monosodium glutamate (MSG) is frequently reported as a dietary trigger, scientific studies do not support this claim. The Framingham Heart Study, published in 1998, surveyed 5,070 people between ages 30-62 and found that scintillating scotomas without other symptoms occurred in 1.23% of the group. The study did not find a link between late-life onset scintillating scotoma and stroke. Prognosis Symptoms typically appear gradually over 5 to 20 minutes and generally last less than 60 minutes, leading to the headache in classic migraine with aura, or resolving without consequence in acephalgic migraine. Many migraine sufferers change from scintillating scotoma as a prodrome to migraine to scintillating scotoma without migraine. Typically the scotoma resolves spontaneously within the stated time frame, leaving no subsequent symptoms, though some report fatigue, nausea, and dizziness as sequelae. Etymology  The British physician John Fothergill described the condition in the 18th century and called it fortification spectrum. The British physician Hubert Airy coined the term scintillating scotoma for it by 1870; he derived it from the Latin scintilla \\"spark\\" and the Ancient Greek skotos \\"darkness\\". Other terms for the condition include flittering scotoma, fortification figure, fortification of Vauban, geometrical spectrum, herringbone, Norman arch, teichopsia, and telehopsia.

Abend, 495 U.S. 207 (1990), was a United States Supreme Court decision holding that a successor copyright owner (one who obtains ownership later on, such as the heirs of a copyright owner who dies) has the exclusive right to permit the creation and exploitation of derivative works, regardless of potentially conflicting agreements by prior copyright holders.. Facts Cornell Woolrich originally wrote the short story \\"It Had to Be Murder\\", and sold the publication rights to Popular Publications, Inc., which published the story in its Dime Detective Magazine (February 1942 issue). Three years later, Woolrich sold the movie rights to a production company, and agreed by contract to renew those rights when the 28-year copyright (then in force) expired. In 1953 the movie rights were bought for $10,000 by Patron Inc., a production company formed by actor James Stewart and director Alfred Hitchcock. The short story was then made into the acclaimed movie Rear Window (1954), directed by Hitchcock and starring Stewart. Woolrich died in 1968, before the expiration of his 28-year copyright, and control of the literary rights passed to his executor, Chase Manhattan Bank. Chase sold the movie rights for $650 to literary agent Sheldon Abend. Abend refused to honor Woolrich's original agreement to renew the copyright and assign it to the owner of the movie rights, and instead sued Stewart when the movie was shown on television. Opinion of the Court The question presented was whether the owner of a legal derivative work infringes the rights of the successor copyright owner, by continued distribution and publication of the derivative work during the renewal term of the pre-existing work. The Court held that the assignment was an unfulfilled contingency that died with the author; the successor can prevent continued use of the derivative work. In justifying its decision, the Court noted that control of the work reverts to the author--or author‚Äôs successors--when renewal comes up. This protects the author (and the heirs) from being deprived of the surprising value of the work.

Maria Pia, commonly known as Ponte de Dona Maria Pia) is a railway bridge built in 1877, and attributed to Gustave Eiffel, situated over the Portuguese northern municipalities of Porto and Vila Nova de Gaia. Part of the Linha Norte system of the national railway, the wrought iron, double-hinged, crescent arch spans , over the Douro River. At the time of its construction, it was the longest single-arch span in the world; today, it is no longer used for rail transport and was replaced by a modern structure in 1991. It is often confused with the D. Lu√≠s Bridge, which was built nine years later and is located to the west, but resembles the structure, albeit with two decks. History The Maria Pia Bridge during construction: the two halves of the arch have been connected, but their weight is still supported by cables. A view of the Mia Pia Bridge in 1877 In 1875, the Royal Portuguese Railway Company announced a competition for a bridge to carry the Lisbon to Porto railway across the river Douro. This was very technically demanding: the river was fast-flowing, its depth could be as much as during times of flooding and the riverbed was made up of a deep layer of gravel. These factors ruled out the construction of piers in the river, so that the bridge would have to have a central span of 160m (525 ft) At the time the longest bridge span was the 158.5m (520 ft) of the bridge built by James B. Eads over the Mississippi at St Louis. When the project was approved, Jo√£o Cris√≥stomo de Abreu e Sousa, member of the Junta Consultiva das Obras P√∫blicas (Consultative Junta for Public Works) considered that the deck should have two lanes. Gustave Eiffel's design proposal, priced at 965,000 French francs, was the least expensive of the four designs considered, around two thirds of the cost of the nearest competitor. Since the company was relatively inexperienced, a commission was appointed to report on their suitability to undertake the work. Their report was favorable, although it did emphasise the difficulty of the project: Responsibility for the actual design is difficult to attribute, but it is probable that a large part was played by Th√©ophile Seyrig, Eiffel's business partner, who presented a paper on the bridge to the Soci√©t√© des Ing√©nieurs Civils in 1878. Eiffel, in his account of the bridge, which accompanied the 1:50 scale model exhibited at the 1878 World's Fair, credited Seyrig, along with Henry de Dion, with work on the calculations and drawings. Construction started on 5 January 1876, and work on the abutments, piers and approach decking was complete by September. Work then paused due to winter flooding, and the erection of the central arch span was not re-started until March 1877.Loyrette (1985), p.60 Construction was completed on 1 October 1877. By 28 October 1877, the platform was mounted and concluded, with the work on the bridge executed using a complement of 150 workers finishing on 30 October 1878. Tests were performed between 1 and 2 November, leading to the 4 November inauguration by King D. Louis I and Queen Maria Pia of Savoy (the eponym of the bridge). Another view between 1900 and 1910, showing the anchorages in cliffside of Semin√°rio The boats along the river in the show of the Maria Pia Between 1897 and 1898 there was some concern by technicians about the integrity of the bridge; its width, the interruption of principal beams, its lightweight structure resulted in an elastic nature. In 1890, in Ovar, the Oficina de Obras Met√°licas (Metal Works Office) existed to support the work to reinforce and repair those structures. As a consequence, restrictions were placed on transit over the structure between 1900 and 1906: weight limited to 14 tons per lane and velocity to per hour. Alterations to the deck of the bridge were performed under the initiatives of Xavier Cordeiro in 1900. These were followed between 1901 and 1906 by improvements to the triangular beams were performed by the Oficina of Ovar. Consulting with a specialist in metallic structures (the French engineer Manet Rabut) in 1907, the Oficina concluded that the arch and the works performed on the bridge were sufficient to allow circulation. But, this did not impede further work on the fore- and aft-structural members to make the bridge more accessible and to reinforce the main pillars. In 1916, a commission was created to study the possibility of a secondary transit between Vila Nova de Gaia and Porto. By 1928, the bridge was already an obstacle to transit. In 1948, engineer Jo√£o de Lemos executed several studies to evaluate the bridge's condition: study of the deck (including structural members); analysis of the continuous beams and the arch's structural supports. The analysis of the stability of the bridge was handled by the Laborat√≥rio Nacional de Engenharia Civil (LNEC), that resulted in the injection of cement and repair of the masonry joints and pillars, that connected with metallic structures. At the same time, flaking paint was removed from the structure and issues with corrosion were treated during the work, that included repainting with new metallic paint. These projects resulted from the need to improve the structure for the beginning of CP service across the bridge with improved Series 070 locomotives on 1 November 1950. Following a decade of service, an analytic study in 1966 began to analyze upgrading service to electrical locomotives (B√≤-B√≥), leading to the end of the electrification of the Linha Norte. Verification, in loco, determined stressed tests for the structure in 1969. In 1998, there was a plan to rehabilitate and illuminate the bridge, resulting in the establishment of a tourist train attraction between the Museu dos Transportes and the area that included the wine cellars of Porto, a route that included , using a tunnel formerly closed under the historic centre of Porto. In 1990, the bridge was classified by the American Society of Engineering as an International Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. But in 1991, rail service over the bridge ended because there was only one track and speed restrictions, limiting transit to per hour, or cargo. The rail functions were transited in 1991 over the S√£o Jo√£o Bridge (designed by engineer Edgar Cardoso). Architecture The bridge is in an urban cityscape, over the Douro River, connecting the mount of Semin√°rio, in the municipality of Porto, to the Serra do Pilar, in the lightly populated section of the municipality of Vila Nova de Gaia. The structure consists of a deck long, supported by two piers on one side of the river and three on the other, with a central arch with a span of and a rise of . It is supported on three pillars in Vila Nova da Gaia and by two pillars in Porto. Two shorter pillars support the arch. The five, interlaced support pillars are constructed of a pyramidal format over granite masonry blocks, over six veins, three of which are on the Gaia side and on the Porto side. 149x149px Another innovation was the method of construction used for the central arch. Since it was impossible to use any falsework, the arch was built out from the abutments on either side, their weight being supported by steel cables attached to the top of the piers supporting the deck. The same method was also used to build the decking, temporary tower structures being built above deck level to support the cables. This technique had been previously used by Eads, but its use by Eiffel is a good example of his readiness to use the latest engineering techniques. The design uses a parabolic arch. Over the bridge are painted ironwork guardrails over granite masonry.

He was chairman and chief executive officer of Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., a division of Time Warner which includes TBS, TNT, and Cartoon Network. Kellner took over the post in 2001 and handed over the company to Philip Kent in 2003. He was the chairman of station ownership group ACME Communications, a post held from the company's founding until its folding in 2016. Early life and education Kellner was born to an Irish Catholic family in Brooklyn and grew up on Long Island, New York. He attended Uppsala University in upstate New York. Career After college he participated in the CBS Executive Training Program and after CBS disposed of its syndication division, he rose to the rank of vice president for first-run programming, development, and sales at Viacom. In 1978, he accepted a job as executive of Filmways, a film and television producer and distributor. In 1982, after Filmways was taken over by Orion Pictures, he served as president of its Orion Entertainment Group, where he oversaw and supervised their programming and syndication activities including the launch of Cagney and Lacey. In 1986, he was the first executive hired by Rupert Murdoch and Barry Diller to develop a fourth television network to compete with the big three. At Fox, he was charged with building the affiliate network, selling programming to advertisers, and the establishment of relations with program producers. =Fox Broadcasting Company= Kellner was present at the creation of the Fox Broadcasting Company, which was then considered a radical idea, as it was taking on the three networks that had dominated American television since the 1950s, ABC, CBS and NBC (CBS and NBC were really the \\"big two\\", in regards to ratings and number of affiliates, until ABC experienced a surge in popularity in the late 1960s). Despite incredible skepticism, Kellner was part of the team that gave the network the \\"attitude\\" that has marked the network ever since. Among the shows that emerged during Kellner's seven years at Fox were The Simpsons, Married... with Children, Beverly Hills, 90210, Melrose Place and In Living Color. Those shows held the fledgling \\"web\\" together until Fox shocked the TV world by winning partial rights to the National Football League in 1994 from CBS; that, as well as channel upgrades in many markets due to Fox's alliance and merger with New World Communications, made Fox a legitimate fourth network. =WB Television Network= Kellner then spent seven years at the helm of the WB Television Network. He helped launch the new broadcast network in 1994. During his tenure, Kellner began by championing urban sitcoms, but eventually steered the network in the direction of teen and family-oriented dramas. 7th Heaven, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Gilmore Girls, Dawson's Creek, Felicity and Charmed all premiered during Kellner's presidency. =Head of Turner Broadcasting System= Kellner was made head of Turner Broadcasting System in 2000. He was ultimately the one who made the decision to cancel World Championship Wrestling (WCW) programming on Turner's networks in 2001. The once-powerful WCW was the largest wrestling promotion in the world popularity-wise in the mid-1990s, besting its rival World Wrestling Federation (WWF) head to head on Monday Nights for 83 consecutive weeks. By 2001, it was declining, and lost roughly $80 million the previous year. A combination of resurgent competition from WWF, as well as many bad booking and financial decisions had all but killed WCW's fanbase and profitability. With WCW no longer being financially viable, and AOL Time Warner wanting nothing to do with the product further (desiring to move in a different direction), Kellner canceled all WCW programming on Turner Networks. This left WCW without a television contract, and hastened its eventual purchase by WWF chairman Vince McMahon. In the book The Death of WCW by Bryan Alvarez and RD Reynolds, Kellner is listed as the official \\"killer\\" of WCW, insofar as he made the official call to remove it from Turner Networks. Personal life Kellner and his wife, Julie, have one child, and he also has a daughter from his previous marriage. References Sources *The Death of WCW, by R.D. Reynolds and Bryan Alvarez.

History  Westfield Bondi Junction is built on land that was originally occupied by three separate retail establishments. The oldest of these was a Grace Bros. store (now Myer), opened in 1933 and continued to be occupied until the redevelopment. The land was also occupied by the Carousel Centre which had opened in the 1970s and Bondi Junction Plaza in 1976. In 1994 Westfield bought a controlling stake in Bondi Junction Plaza from AMP and renamed it Westfield Bondi Junction Plaza. In 2000, Westfield purchased the Carousel Centre and the remaining stake in Bondi Junction Plaza. The redevelopment took six years for approval to be gained due to the site being located on the border of Waverley and Woollahra local government areas. In 1997 the Minister for Urban Affairs and Planning, Craig Knowles, approved the initial concept for a redeveloped shopping centre. Following the purchase of the Carousel Centre in 2000, a new expanded scheme was submitted for approval. In 2001 the New South Wales Minister for Planning, Frank Sartor approved the development despite the two councils' objections. The scale of the development was the main reason for the delayed approval process. This included four levels of parking and two levels of shops underground reaching 25 metres below as well as three levels of shops and four levels of parking above ground. In addition a 70-metre tunnel and a 12 metre wide double storey pedestrian bridge above ground. The redevelopment incorporates 458 retailers and was completed in August 2004. As of July 2014, this shopping centre is now under Scentre Group management. Westfield Bondi Junction has been blamed for the downturn in trade in surrounding shopping hubs. The nearby Oxford Street, in Paddington is one example. Retail trade in that location dropped 30% in the four months after the opening of the shopping centre with other locations in Double Bay and Woollahra experiencing similar downturn in trade. In August 2016, Swedish retailer H&M; opened its store at the centre.H&M; confirms Bondi and Broadway launches The store opened on the former terrace food court.

Astley was the second son of Captain Thomas Astley, a jeweller, and his wife Mary n√©e Price. He was born in Liverpool, England, and was brought to Australia with his family in November 1859. The family settled in Richmond, a suburb of Melbourne and William was educated at St Stephen's school and the Melbourne model school. Astley obtained work in booksellers' shops, and after taking up journalism was editor of the Richmond Guardian for a short period when only 21 years of age. He was subsequently connected with the Echuca Riverine Herald and other Victorian journals, the Launceston Daily Telegraph, the Workman, the Worker (Sydney), the Tumut Independent and the Bathurst Free Press. While at Bathurst, New South Wales he was secretary of the Bathurst Federal League, which did useful work for federation. He had regular correspondence with Sir Henry Parkes, Edmund Barton and George Black. During the 1880s and 1890s Astley did some free-lance work for The Bulletin in which four series of his stories of the convict days were published. The first collection of these, Tales of the Convict System, appeared in 1892; this was followed by Tales of the Early Days (1894), Tales of the Old Regime (1897), Tales of the Isle of Death (1898), and Half-Crown Bob and Tales of the Riverine (1898). Astley married Louisa Frances Cope of Launceston, Tasmania on 22 September 1884. He had had a nervous breakdown in 1878, and in his last years there were recurrences of mental trouble. He died at Rookwood Benevolent Asylum, Sydney on 5 October 1911.\\"Death of 'Price Warung'\\" Northern Star, 11 October 1911, p3 Astley was an excellent journalist and short story writer. He had made a study of early Australian history and took great care with his stories. There is a degree of starkness about his work, but his tales are full of human nature and human pity. He must be ranked among the best writers of Australian short stories.  References  * B. G.

After serving as a junior officer during the Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War, he became naval attach√© observing the actions of the Imperial Russian Navy during the Russo-Japanese War and then went on to command an armoured cruiser and then a battleship during the early years of the 20th century. During the First World War Gough-Calthorpe initially served as commander of the 2nd Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet, then became Second Sea Lord and after that became Admiral commanding the Coastguard and Reserves. In the closing years of the War he served as Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, in which capacity he signed the Armistice of Mudros on behalf of all the Allies, by which the Ottoman Empire accepted defeat and ceased hostilities. The Occupation of Constantinople began with the Allied fleet entering Constantinople in November 1918 and it was Gough-Calthorpe's flagship, , that led the way. After the War Gough-Calthorpe served as British Commissioner in the Ottoman Empire during a time of considerable political instability associated with the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire and the allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. Naval career =Early career= Born the son of Lieutenant-General Somerset Gough- Calthorpe, 7th Baron Calthorpe, by his marriage to Eliza Maria Chamier, His grandfather on his mother's side was the novelist Captain Frederick Chamier RN. Gough-Calthorpe joined the Royal Navy as a cadet in the training ship HMS Britannia on 15 January 1878.Heathcote, p. 103 Promoted to midshipman on 19 March 1880, he was appointed to the armoured cruiser HMS Northampton, flagship of the North America and West Indies Station later that year. Promoted to sub- lieutenant on 19 March 1884, he joined the corvette HMS Rover in the Training Squadron in September 1885 and, after further promotion to lieutenant on 19 March 1886, he transferred to the battleship HMS Colossus in June 1886. After attending the torpedo school HMS Vernon, he joined the directing staff there in 1890 and was then in August 1891 was deployed to Hong Kong on torpedo duties, before rejoining the directing staff at HMS Vernon in January 1894. He became torpedo officer in the cruiser HMS St George on the Cape of Good Hope and West Coast of Africa Station in October 1894 and saw action with naval brigades during the Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War. Promoted to commander on 1 January 1896, Gough-Calthorpe became Executive Officer in the armoured cruiser HMS Imperieuse, flagship of the Pacific Station, in March 1896.Heathcote, p. 104 After another tour at HMS Vernon, he became commanding officer of the torpedo gunboat HMS Halcyon in the Mediterranean Fleet in September 1900. He went on to be commanding officer of the cruiser HMS Pandora during propeller trials at Portsmouth in July 1901, and, having been promoted to captain on 1 January 1902 and having attended a course at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, he became naval attach√© observing the actions of the Imperial Russian Navy during the Russo-Japanese War. He became commanding officer of the armoured cruiser HMS Roxburgh in November 1905 and then, having been appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order on 25 September 1906, he became commanding officer of the battleship HMS Hindustan in December 1907. He then became Captain of the Fleet for the Home Fleet in the battleship HMS Dreadnought in December 1909. He was advanced to Commander of the Royal Victorian Order on 2 August 1910. Promoted to rear admiral on 27 August 1911 and, having been appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 27 September 1912, he became second-in-command of the 1st Battle Squadron, with his flag in the battleship HMS St Vincent, in December 1912. In 1912, he was appointed as one of the assessors assisting the British inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic. =First World War= The Battleship, , which, as Gough-Calthorpe's flagship, led the Allied fleet that steamed into Constantinople in November 1918 Gough-Calthorpe became commander of the 2nd Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet, with his flag in the armoured cruiser HMS Shannon, in July 1914 on the outbreak of the First World War. Advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 1 January 1916, he became Second Sea Lord in July 1916 and Admiral commanding the Coastguard and Reserves in December 1916. Promoted to vice-admiral on 26 April 1917, he became Commander- in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet, with his flag in the battleship HMS Superb, in July 1917. In that capacity he established a complex convoy system to protect British and allied shipping at sea in the Mediterranean from attack by enemy submarines. Portrait by Philip Connard of Gough-Calthorpe on board HMS Superb at Constantinople in November 1918 He went on to sign the Armistice of Mudros on behalf of all the Allies on 30 October 1918, by which the Ottoman Empire accepted defeat and ceased hostilities. Georges Clemenceau, Prime Minister of France, complained that Admiral Dominique-Marie Gauchet had not been present at the treaty signing but the British Government gave Gough-Calthorpe its full backing. When the Allied fleet steamed into Constantinople in November 1918, it was Gough-Calthorpe's flagship, HMS Superb, that led the way. =After the war= Gough-Calthorpe became British Commissioner in the Ottoman Empire at the end of the War during a time of considerable political instability associated with the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire and the allied intervention in the Russian Civil War.

Medium spiny neurons have two primary phenotypes (characteristic types): D1-type MSNs of the direct pathway and D2-type MSNs of the indirect pathway. Most striatal MSNs contain only D1-type or D2-type dopamine receptors, but a subpopulation of MSNs exhibit both phenotypes. Direct pathway MSNs excite their ultimate basal ganglia output structure (e.g., the thalamus) and promote associated behaviors; these neurons express D1-type dopamine receptors, adenosine A1 receptors, dynorphin peptides, and substance P peptides. Indirect pathway MSNs inhibit their output structure and in turn inhibit associated behaviors; these neurons express D2-type dopamine receptors, adenosine A2A receptors (A2A), heterotetramers, and enkephalin. Both types express glutamate receptors (NMDAR and AMPAR), cholinergic receptors (M1 and M4) and CB1 receptors are expressed on the somatodendritic area of both MSN types. A subpopulation of MSNs contain both D1-type and D2-type receptors, with approximately 40% of striatal MSNs expressing both DRD1 and DRD2 mRNA. In the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), these mixed-type MSNs that contain both D1-type and D2-type receptors are mostly contained in the NAcc shell. The dorsal striatal MSNs play a key role in initiating and controlling movements of the body, limbs, and eyes. The ventral striatal MSNs play a key role in motivation, reward, reinforcement, and aversion. Dorsal and ventral medium spiny neuron subtypes (i.e., direct D1-type and indirect D2-type) are identical phenotypes, but their output connections differ. Confocal microscopy Z projection of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the mouse striatum. The neurons were labeled using the matrisome MSN mouse Gpr101-Cre in combination with a dtTomato (red fluorescent protein) reporter. A 3D projection of the same neurons can be viewed here.  Appearance and location  The medium spiny neurons are medium-sized neurons (~15 microns in diameter, ~12‚Äì13 microns in the mouse) with large and extensive dendritic trees (~500 microns in diameter). Striatal direct pathway MSNs (dMSNs) project directly to the globus pallidus internal (GPi) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr) whereas striatal indirect pathway MSNs (iMSNs) ultimately project to these two structures via an intermediate connection to the globus pallidus external (GPe) and ventral pallidum (VP). The GPe and VP send a GABAergic projection to the subthalamic nucleus, which then sends glutamatergic projections to the GPi and SNpr. Both the GPi and SNpr send inhibitory projections to nuclei within the thalamus.  Function  MSNs are inhibitory GABAergic neurons, but the effect of direct MSNs (dMSNs) and indirect MSNs (iMSNs) on their ultimate output structures differs: dMSNs excite, while iMSNs inhibit, their basal ganglia output structures (e.g., the thalamus). Within the basal ganglia, there are several complex circuits of neuronal loops all of which include medium spiny neurons. The cortical, thalamic, and brain-stem inputs that arrive at the medium spiny neurons show a vast divergence in that each incoming axon forms contacts with many spiny neurons and each spiny neuron receives a vast amount of input from different incoming axons. Since these inputs are glutamatergic they exhibit an excitatory influence on the inhibitory medium spiny neurons. There are also interneurons in the striatum which regulate the excitability of the medium spiny neurons. The synaptic connections between a particular GABAergic interneuron, the parvalbumin expressing fast-spiking interneuron, and spiny neurons are close to the spiny neurons' soma, or cell body. Recall that excitatory postsynaptic potentials caused by glutamatergic inputs at the dendrites of the spiny neurons only cause an action potential when the depolarization wave is strong enough upon entering the cell soma. Since the fast-spiking interneurons influence is located so closely to this critical gate between the dendrites and the soma, they can readily regulate the generation of an action potential. Additionally, other types of GABAergic interneurons make connections with the spiny neurons. These include interneurons that express tyrosine hydroxylase and neuropeptide Y. Dorsal striatal MSNs =Direct pathway=  Anatomy  The direct pathway within the basal ganglia receives excitatory input from the cortex, thalamus, and other brain regions. In the direct pathway, medium spiny neurons project to the internal division of the globus pallidus (GPi) or the substantia nigra pars reticula (SNpr or SNr). These nuclei project to the deep layer of the superior colliculus and control fast eye movements (saccades), and also project to the ventral thalamus, which in turn projects to upper motor neurons in the primary motor cortex (precentral gyrus). The SNr and GPi outputs are both tonically active inhibitory nuclei and are thus constantly inhibiting the thalamus (and thus motor cortex). However, transient activity in (inhibitory) direct pathway medium spiny neurons ultimately disinhibits thalamus projections to the motor cortex and enables movement. =Indirect pathway=  Anatomy  The indirect pathway also receives excitatory input from various brain regions. Indirect pathway medium spiny neurons project to the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe). Like the GPi, the GPe is a tonically active inhibitory nucleus. The GPe projects to the excitatory subthalamic nucleus (STN), which in turn projects to the GPi and SNr. When the indirect pathway is not activated, activity in the STN is suppressed by the GPe, which translates to decreased SNr/GPi activity downstream and thus increased thalamic and motor cortex neuron activity. When indirect pathway neurons fire, GPe neurons are inhibited, which disinhibits the STN. The STN then excites SNr/GPi neurons, suppressing thalamus/motor cortex activity. = Functional distinctions = Classic models of striatal function have posited that activation of the direct pathway leads to movement, whereas activation of the indirect pathway leads to the termination of movement. This model is supported by experiments demonstrating that optogenetically stimulating direct pathway medium spiny neurons increases locomotion, whereas stimulating indirect pathway medium spiny neurons inhibits locomotion. The balance of direct/indirect activity in movement is supported by evidence from neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), which is characterized by loss of dopamine neurons projecting to the striatum, hypoactivity in direct pathway and hyperactivity in indirect pathway neurons, along with motor dysfunction. This results in loss of normal action selection, as loss of dopamine drives activity in the indirect pathway, globally inhibiting all motor paradigms. This may explain impaired action initiation, slowed actions (bradykinesia), and impaired voluntary motor initiation in Parkinson's patients. On the other hand, Huntington's disease, which is characterized by preferential degradation of indirect pathway medium spiny neurons, results in unwanted movements (chorea) that may result from impaired movement inhibition and predominant direct pathway activity. An alternative related hypothesis is that the striatum controls action initiation and selection via a ‚Äôcenter-surround‚Äô architecture, where activation of a subset of direct pathway neurons initiates movements while closely related motor patterns represented by surrounding neurons are inhibited by lateral inhibition via indirect pathway neruons. This specific hypothesis is supported by recent calcium-imaging work showing that direct and indirect pathway medium spiny neurons encoding specific actions are located in spatially organized ensembles. Despite the abundance of evidence for the initiation/termination model, recent evidence using transgenic mice expressing calcium indicators in either the direct or indirect pathway demonstrated that both pathways are active at action initiation, but neither are active during inactivity, a finding which has been replicated using simultaneous two-channel calcium imaging. This has led to somewhat of a paradigm shift in models of striatal functioning, such that newer models posit that the direct pathway facilitates wanted movements, whereas the indirect pathway simultaneously inhibits unwanted movements. Indeed, more sophisticated techniques and analyses, such as state-dependent optogenetics, have revealed that both pathways are heavily involved in action sequence execution, and that specifically, both striatal pathways are involved in element-level action control. However, direct pathway medium spiny neurons mostly signal sequence initiation/termination and indirect pathway medium spiny neurons may signal switching between subsequences of a given action sequence. Other evidence suggests that the direct and indirect pathway oppositely influence the termination of movement‚Äîspecifically, the relative timing of their activity determines if an action will be terminated. Recent experiments have established that the direct and indirect pathways of the dorsal striatum are not solely involved in movement. Initial experiments in an intracranial self-stimulation paradigm suggested opposing roles in reinforcement for the two pathways; specifically, stimulation of direct pathway medium spiny neurons was found to be reinforcing, whereas stimulation of indirect pathway medium spiny neurons was aversive. However, a subsequent study (using more physiologically relevant stimulation parameters) found that direct and indirect pathway stimulation was reinforcing, but that pathway-specific stimulation resulted in the development of different action strategies. Regardless, these studies suggest a critical role for reinforcement in the dorsal striatum, as opposed to the striatum only serving a role in movement control. Ventral striatal MSNs =Direct pathway= The direct pathway of the ventral striatum within the basal ganglia mediates reward-based learning and appetitive incentive salience, which is assigned to rewarding stimuli. =Indirect pathway= The indirect pathway of the ventral striatum within the basal ganglia mediates aversion-based learning and aversive motivational salience, which is assigned to aversive stimuli.

It ran between Oakland and Bakersfield, California; its bus connections provided service between San Francisco and Los Angeles via California's San Joaquin Valley. History In 1912 The Santa Fe tried to compete with Southern Pacific Railroad (SP) with overnight trains that included cars to and from San Diego, the Saint train to San Francisco and the Angel train to Los Angeles. The Santa Fe route via San Bernardino and Barstow was longer than the SP route via Glendale and Lancaster and the San Francisco to Los Angeles schedule was 16 hrs 45 minutes, compared to 14:45 for SP's Owl and 13:45 for the Lark. The Saint and Angel were withdrawn in 1918. Although rumors soon flew of their return, Santa Fe later cited competition by bus services as preventing restoration of the Saint and Angel schedules. In 1936 the completion of improvements on the Ridge Route highway south of Bakersfield and the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge gave the Santa Fe an opportunity to compete with the SP with faster service. The lightweight Golden Gate streamliners were assigned Nos. 60-63 and ran daily between Oakland (station was actually in Emeryville) and Bakersfield. Santa Fe buses connected San Francisco across the San Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge to Oakland and between Bakersfield and Los Angeles, most with stops at North Hollywood and Hollywood and some with stops at Burbank, Glendale, and Pasadena. The Oakland transfer point moved to Richmond in 1958 with buses making stops at Oakland and Berkeley. A competitor to the Southern Pacific Railroad's San Joaquin Daylight, the Golden Gate's scheduled 9-hour and 25-minute time bested that of the Daylight. After a series of hearings and legal challenges, as well as public displays of the new rolling stock, the new six-car consists entered service on July 1, 1938. Coach fares were $6.00 one-way, $10.80 round-trip, rates that were matched by the SP. San Francisco to Los Angeles was 312.8 rail miles () plus 112 bus miles (). In early 1939, the Golden Gate was involved in what was believed to be the first collision between a modern streamlined train and an automobile when it was struck by a car in Richmond. In 1939 another train, the Valley Flyer, was added to the Bakersfield-Oakland route to carry passengers to the Golden Gate International Exposition. In 1940 the Exposition ended and this train moved to the San Diego to Los Angeles route. Citing losses of up to $421,000 in 1963 (), the Santa Fe applied to discontinue the Golden Gate. The California Public Utilities Commission held hearings on the discontinuance of the service in 1964 and authorized discontinuance of the service in March 1965 stating that \\"the public reaction [to discontinuing the service] was apathetic to say the least.\\" Yet just seven years earlier in 1957, passenger feedback was cited as the reason to adjust the Golden Gate timetable about one hour earlier in the day. The Golden Gate was all but eliminated on April 11, 1965, though No. 62 was reassigned as No. 8 and took over the duties of the southbound Fast Mail Express. That service ended April 28, 1968. Today Amtrak California's San Joaquin runs the same route from Port Chicago to Bakersfield. =Timeline= * January 20, 1912: The Santa Fe begins service between Los Angeles and San Francisco via Barstow and Bakersfield with overnight trains with through cars from/to San Diego, the Saint northbound and the Angel southbound. * December 31, 1918: The Saint and the Angel are discontinued. * October 8, 1935: The Santa Fe applies for permission from the Railroad Commission of the State of California to operate \\"one-ticket, point- to-point, streamlined train service\\" between San Francisco and Bakersfield, with coordinated motor coach (bus) service extending the route south to Los Angeles. * November 12, 1936: The San Francisco ‚Äì Oakland Bay Bridge opens. * July 1, 1938: Santa Fe's coordinated rail-bus service starts. * June 11, 1939: The Valley Flyer is added to the route to serve the Golden Gate International Exposition. * 1940: The Golden Gate consists expand to seven cars with the addition of two \\"chair\\" cars. * 1940-1941 Valley Flyer reassigned to service between San Diego and Los Angeles. * 1942: Consist expands to 7 cars, and each logs 626 daily miles (). * July 1949: Valley-type 6-6-4 sleeping cars are added to train Nos. 60 and 61. * 1957: Train Nos. 62 and 63 add railway post office cars to their consists. * 1958: round-end observation cars are discontinued. * February 2, 1958: Train No. 61 is withdrawn from service. * June 15, 1958: rail service is cut back from Oakland to Richmond. * April 11, 1965: Train Nos. 60 and 63 are withdrawn and No. 62 is redesignated as No. 8. * April 28, 1968: The Golden Gate makes its last run.

Work  Since the 1960s, Roy Ascott has been a practitioner of interactive computer art, electronic art, cybernetic art and telematic art. The historian of art and technology Frank Popper writes of Roy Ascott: In his first show (1964) at the Molton Gallery, London, he exhibited Analogue Structures and Diagram Boxes, comprising change-paintings and other works in wood, perspex and glass. In 1964 Ascott published \\"Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision\\" in Cybernetica: journal of the International Association for Cybernetics (Namur). In 1968, he was elected Associate Member of the Institution of Computer Science, London (proposed by Gordon Pask). In 1972, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts. International Exhibitions Ascott has shown at the Venice Biennale, Shanghai Biennale, Electra Paris, Ars Electronica, V2 Institute for the Unstable Media, Milan Triennale, Biennale do Mercosul, Brazil, European Media Festival, and gr2000az at Graz, Austria. His first telematic project was La Plissure du Texte (1983), an online work of \\"distributed authorship\\" involving artists around the world. The second was his \\"gesamtdatenwerk\\" Aspects of Gaia: Digital Pathways across the Whole Earth (1989), an installation for the Ars Electronica Festival in Linz, discussed by (inter alia) Matthew Wilson Smith in The Total Work of Art: from Bayreuth to Cyberspace, New York: Routledge, 2007. Retrospective exhibitions of his work were shown in May 2009 at Plymouth Arts Centre, England, then in the Incheon International Digital Arts Festival, Incheon, South Korea in September 2010, and at SPACE (studios) in Hackney, London in 2011. Syncretic Cybernetics, a comprehensive exhibition of his work, was featured in the 9th Shanghai Biennale 2012. Roy Ascott: The Analogues (featuring his work of the 1960s) was shown at the Plug-in Institute ofContemporary Arts, Winnipeg, July‚ÄìSept 2013. In September 2014, a mini retrospective of his work was shown in Linz, at the time of his Ars Electronica Golden Nica award . He discussed his work on Geran TV. The seminal work of 1962, \\"Video-Roget\\" was acquired in 2014, by the Tate Gallery, London for its permanent collection. Two key works were included in \\"Electronic Superhighway\\", at the Whitechapel Gallery, London in 2016. \\"Art in Europe 1945‚Äì68\\" shown in ZKM, Karlsruhr, Germany Oct 2016/ Jan 2017, included his \\"Change-painting 1966\\". His early work was the subject of the exhibition \\"Roy Ascott: Form has Behaviour\\", at the Henry Moore Institute, Leeds, Jan/Apr 2017.  Interactive computer art  Since the 1960s, Ascott has been working with interactive computer art, telematic art. and systems art. Ascott built a theoretical framework for approaching interactive artworks, which brought together certain characteristics of Dada, Surrealism, Fluxus, Happenings, and Pop Art with the science of cybernetics. He was also influenced by the writings of Gordon Pask, Anthony Stafford Beer, William Ross Ashby, and F.H. George.A critical survey of Ascott's work is provided by Edward A.

However, Barbour states clearly that it was fought at Christmas of 1307. Many current historians accept Fordun's date, but Barron and some others believe that Bower misinterpreted Fordun's notes. Though part of the wider Wars of Scottish Independence, it is more properly viewed as an episode in a brief but bitter civil war. The battle was a victory for the Scottish king Robert Bruce over his chief domestic enemy, John Comyn, 3rd Earl of Buchan. It was followed by the Harrying of Buchan, a violent act of destruction of property long remembered with bitterness in Buchan. The battlefield was added to the Inventory of Historic Battlefields in Scotland in 2011. Blood feud In February 1306, Robert Bruce and his supporters killed John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch, also known as the Red Comyn. Comyn was a nephew of the former king John Balliol and had been a leading player in the wars against the English. His death automatically meant that his extensive network of family and associates would regard Bruce as an enemy. Chief among these was Comyn's cousin and namesake, John Comyn, Earl of Buchan. Edward I of England died in July 1307. His son, Edward II, preoccupied with political problems at home, left his Scottish allies unsupported at a critical time. Bruce acted quickly, on the assumption that the English were bound to return in strength for the campaigning season in 1308. Bruce's Seat, the stone from which King Robert is reputed to have directed the battle Lightning war One by one King Robert confronted his domestic enemies, beginning with the Balliol party in Galloway. From the south of the country he moved through the English-held central lowlands, making his way by the western route through Argyllshire through the Great Glen towards Inverness and the north-east, towards the territory held by Buchan. He had under his command as many as 3.000 men according to a letter sent by the Earl of Ross to King Edward. However, that number may have been an exaggeration in order for the earl to justify his inaction against King Robert. However, King Robert was overtaken by an unknown illness, which kept him out of action for a considerable time, and he had with him no more than about 700 men by the time of the Battle of Inverurie. Unfortunately the only accounts of the whole campaign in Aberdeenshire are from sources uniformly hostile to Buchan. Although Buchan made some attempt to take advantage of the situation by an attack by archers on the king's camp at Slioch, which was repulsed. Edward Bruce shifted his camp to Strathbogie, and the king was carried there on a litter. Davidson, John. Inverurie and the Earldom of the Garioch, D. Douglas, Garioch (Scotland), 1878 View of the Bruce Field, the site of the battle The Hill of Barra During his illness, King Robert was carried from place to place by his supporters. In either December 1307 or May 1308 depending on which account is correct, his army made camp on the far side of Inverurie near Oldmeldrum. Buchan gathered his forces, ready to attack King Robert the following day. His army made camp at Meldrum, to the north-east of King Robert. At dawn, David, Lord of Brechin made a surprise attack on one of King Robert's outposts, killing many; the rest fled to the main force on the far side of Inverurie. King Robert, who was still ill, rose from his bed and prepared a counter-attack. As he approached, Buchan hastily drew up his forces astride the road to Inverurie, between Barra Hill and the marshes of the Lochter Burn. His unreliable feudal levies were placed to the rear, with the knights and men-at-arms taking up a position to the front. The levies seem to have been given the assurance that King Robert was too ill to take to the field in person, and their shocked reaction when he came into sight explains in part why Buchan's army collapsed so quickly. John Barbour describes the scene in his rhyming narrative: The king came on in fine array With much display his foes stood set Until the ranks were nerly met. But when his foemen saw the king Advancing without lingering, A little on their reins they drew. The king by this time right well knew That in their hearts they were distressed, And with his banners forward pressed. Thus they retreated more and more. And when the small folk with them saw Their leaders all retreating so, They quickly turned their backs to go, And fled and scattered far and wide. Their lords, that still were side by side, When they beheld the small folk flee, And the king advancing steadily, Themselves became disheartened so That they, too, turned their backs to go. A short while stayed they side by side, And then they scattered far and wide. Buchan made some attempt to steady the line, but he too soon joined the flight, pursued by the King's men as far as Fyvie. Later that year, probably after the fall of his castles, the fugitive earl took his flight to England, where he died the same year. The Battle of Inverurie and the Harrying of Buchan ended active resistance to King Robert in Aberdeenshire. He was not, however, prepared to risk leaving a potentially hostile district in his rear, and took drastic action which was to last in living memory for some fifty years beyond the event. Immediately following the battle, King Robert ordered his men to burn to the ground farms, homes, and strongholds associated with the Comyns in the violent Harrying of Buchan.

It was licensed to Stern for U.S. distribution the same year. In France and Japan, the game is titled Le Bagnard (English: The Convict). Bagman was followed-up with Super Bagman in 1984. Gameplay The objective of the game is to maneuver the bagman through various mine shafts, picking up money bags and placing them in a wheelbarrow at the surface of the mine. The player must avoid pursuing guards, moving ore carts, and descending elevators. The player may temporarily stun the guards by striking them with a pickaxe or by dropping money bags on them when they are below the player on the same ladder. The player may move between the three screens which make up the level via shafts and on the surface. Bagman is played using one 4-way joystick and one action button. The joystick is also used to jump out of the ore cart. The action button is used to perform the following tasks: #Pick up and drop money bags #Pick up and drop pickaxe #Grab and release the ceiling beam to avoid the ore cart (this can be done while carrying a money bag) #Placing a money bag in the wheelbarrow #Pick up and drop the wheelbarrow Points are scored for each horizontal step the player takes, for each money bag placed in the wheelbarrow, and for each guard stunned.

Though it was seen numerous extensions and alterations, much of the original stone has survived. The theatre is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. Prior to its construction, theatrical performances were held in barns and inns in Lancaster as early as the 1760s. for example during the summer of 1777, the play The Orphan of China by Arthur Murphy was performed in one of these temporary theatres.Fleury, p.226‚Äì230. The theatre was built in 1781, becoming one of the first permanent theatres in Britain. The theatre was opened in June 1782, by Joseph Austin (an actor) and Charles Edward Whitlock (a dentist), who managed a circuit of theatres across the north of England.Dalziel, p.139 It was known simply as \\"The Theatre, Lancaster\\". In that first summer, the plays Hamlet and The Belle's Stratagem were performed at the theatre, and received good reviews. In 1795, Macbeth was performed, and playing Lady Macbeth was Sarah Siddons, who was the sister-in-law of Whitlock. In September 1833 Italian violinist Niccol√≤ Paganini played at the theatre. By the end of the 1830s, the theatre was less used for performances, and increasingly used for meetings of the Temperance society and for formal lectures.Winstanley, p.185 In 1843 Edmund Sharpe bought the theatre, and after an extension and alteration, he reopened it in 1849 as a music hall as well as a museum for the local Literary and Natural History Society. By 1860 it was owned and operated by a private company called the Lancaster Athenaeum, which Sharpe founded.Winstanley, p.185 says \\"operated after 1849 by a private company which he found, the Lancaster Athenaeum\\", while the Theatre Trust website says \\"From 1860 it was owned by the Lancaster Athenaeum Company\\". The theatre was closed in 1882.The Theatre Trust website says it \\"was closed as unsafe in 1882\\", while Winstanley p.204 says \\"Even before the promoters of the Athenaeum went into liquidation in 1882..\\" In May 1884 the theatre found a new owner, Henry Wilkinson, who had the building was altered, and it was re-opened as the Athenaeum Theatre.Fleury, p.228 In 1897 the theatre was modified again, including a new stage, by architect Frank Matcham. The work of Matcham was lost when the building was badly damaged by fire in 1908. With the interior rebuilt in the same year (the new design by architect Albert Winstanley), it re-opened as The Grand Theatre. The Grand Theatre seats 457 on two levels. It is owned by the Lancaster Footlights who started performing in the 1920s and bought the Grand Theatre in 1951 to save it from demolition. The Grand Theatre plays host to amateur and professional shows. There are plans for a major building programme, \\"New spaces\\", to start in 2009: one extension will provide new reception, foyer and bar space and another will provide rehearsal space, workshop, costume department and scenery storage space.

Originally built in the early 18th century, it has been owned and occupied by the White family (formerly Earls of Bantry) since the mid-18th century. Opened to the public since the 1940s, the house, estate and gardens are a tourist destination in West Cork. History Bantry House (originally called 'Blackrock') was constructed in about 1710 on the South side of Bantry Bay. In 1750, Councillor Richard White bought Blackrock from Samuel Hutchinson and changed the name to 'Seafield'. The Whites had settled on Whiddy Island across the Bay in the late 17th century, after having originally been merchants in Limerick. The family prospered and considerable purchases of land were made in the area surrounding the house. By the 1780s, Bantry House comprised approximately , though much of this would not be arable. The house has been open to tourism since 1946. Gardens The gardens to Bantry House were developed by the second Earl of Bantry and his wife Mary. The gardens contain seven terraces; the house is located on the third. One hundred steps are located behind the house and fountain, and are surrounded by azaleas and rhododendron. By 1997 the grounds of Bantry House were suffering from neglect in certain places. A European grant was obtained to start the restoration process. Funding ceased in 2000. The restoration work is still ongoing. Armada centre An exhibition on the role Bantry House played in the United Irishmen Rebellion was opened in the courtyard of the house ahead of the rebellion's bi-centenary. The exhibition was designed to cover the French expedition to Ireland in 1796, and the role of Richard White, then owner of the house, in opposing the attempted landings. Ultimately the French armada never landed, as severe weather resulted in the loss of several ships - including the frigate Surveillante.

Early life Born in 1874 in Savannah, Tennessee, Mary Elizabeth Patterson was the child of Mildred (n√©e McDougal) and Edmund D. Patterson, a Confederate army veteran.\\"United States Census of 1880\\", Fourth Civil District, Hardin County, Tennessee, enumeration dates June 22-23, 1880. Digital copy of original enumeration page available at FamilySearch, a free online genealogical database provided as a public service by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints, Salt Lake City, Utah. Retrieved August 18, 2017. Federal census records document that her father by 1880 was a lawyer and residing with his wife and children in the home of his father-in-law, Garrick Archibald McDougal, a widower, who was also a lawyer and farmer in Savannah. That same census lists Elizabeth as the second child of the Pattersons' four offspring. She had an older sister, Annie Belle, and two younger brothers, Edmund and Archie. With regard to Elizabeth's education, it extended well beyond the local county schools. She also studied at Tennessee colleges in Pulaski and Columbia, where her participation in campus theater groups fostered a growing passion for drama. Her parents soon sent her to Europe in hopes of diminishing her interest in theater; yet, Elizabeth's determination to become an actress was only reinforced during those travels, especially in Paris, where she attended productions of the Com√©die Fran√ßaise. After returning from Europe, Patterson used money from a small inheritance to move to Chicago. There she joined a theatrical troupe and subsequently toured with repertory companies. In 1913, she made her Broadway debut in the play Everyman. She remained active in New York City theatre through 1954. Film career In 1926, at the age of 51, Patterson was cast in her first movie, a silent film, The Boy Friend.Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released The Boy Friend in August 1926. Elizabeth Patterson, who was born on November 22, 1874, would have therefore been 51 years old at the time of that film's casting, actual production, and release. Transitioning successfully into the era of \\"talkies\\", she remained a very busy actress in Hollywood throughout the 1930s, averaging more than five films a year during that decade, usually in supporting roles. A few of her screen credits at that time include Tarnished Lady; Husband's Holiday; A Bill of Divorcement; So Big!; The Story of Temple Drake; Hold Your Man; Remember the Night; Dinner at Eight; High, Wide, and Handsome; and No Man of Her Own. She also appeared in the role of Susan in two adaptations of John Willard's popular play The Cat and the Canary: The Cat Creeps in 1930 and The Cat and the Canary in 1939.\\"Elizabeth Patterson\\", filmography. Internet Movie Database (IMDb), a subsidiary of Amazon, Seattle, Washington. Retrieved August 19, 2017. Patterson continued to perform frequently in the 1940s, when she was cast in more than 30 additional films. Among her notable roles is her 1949 portrayal of the heroic character Eunice Habersham in the groundbreaking racial crime drama Intruder in the Dust, a film based on the William Faulkner novel of the same name and set in the Deep South. Although she would appear in a few more feature films in the 1950s, such as Washington Story and Pal Joey, Patterson by then began to focus her work increasingly on roles in the rapidly expanding medium of television. I Love Lucy In 1952, at the age of 77, Patterson made her first appearance on the hit CBS-TV sitcom I Love Lucy in the episode \\"The Marriage License\\". In that installment, Patterson's character, Mrs. Willoughby, is the wife of the Greenwich, Connecticut, justice of the peace (played by character actor Irving Bacon) who remarries Lucy and Ricky Ricardo. In that role, she most notably sings an off-key version of \\"I Love You Truly\\" during the wedding ceremony. The following year she was cast in a featured guest role as Mrs. Matilda Trumbull in the episode \\"No Children Allowed\\". Patterson's character of Mrs. Trumbull was initially an ornery curmudgeon who resided in the same New York apartment building as the Ricardos. In that installment, she threatened to make trouble for the Ricardos since the building did not allow children. At the end of the episode, however, her character softens as she holds for the first time the Ricardos' baby, \\"Little Ricky\\"; and, as a result, Mrs. Trumbull becomes friends with both the Ricardos and the building's owners, Fred and Ethel Mertz. Patterson's character on I Love Lucy proved to be so popular among viewers, as well as useful to the writers of the series, that she continued in the role for three more years, often serving in episode storylines as a convenient babysitter for \\"Little Ricky\\". In the fall of 1956, with I Love Lucy in its final season, Patterson made her last appearance as Mrs. Trumbull in \\"Little Ricky Learns to Play the Drums\\". Her character was mentioned one last time in the 1957 episode \\"Lucy Raises Chickens\\". In that installment, Fred and Ethel decide to follow the Ricardos and move to Connecticut to be near them, and Mrs. Trumbull's sister moves into 623 East 68th Street to manage the apartment building for the Mertzes. Other television appearances Prior to, during, and after her work on I Love Lucy, Patterson appeared in many other American television series during the 1950s and early 1960s. Her first credited performance on the \\"small screen\\" was in March 1950 in \\"The Walking Stick\\", a teleplay on the NBC anthology series The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre.\\"The Walking Stick\\", S02E27, The Chevrolet Tele-Theatre, originally broadcast March 20, 1950.

The school is one of sixty-one Chinese Independent High Schools in Malaysia. In 2007, the school was chosen as one of the ten Chinese Independent High Schools in Malaysia to be included as a Cluster School under the Education Blueprint of the Malaysian Government's Ninth Malaysia Plan. History =1962‚Äî1965: Early history= In 1962, the Malaysian government brought in legislation that only students who excelled in their Ujian Pencapaian Sekolah Rendah (Primary School Leaving Examination) and were under the age of thirteen were eligible for education in secondary school. As a result, at least 40-50% of students in the city were unable to further their studies, the majority of whom were Chinese. The Chinese community consequently opened Tshung Tsin school to solve this problem. It was founded by the Api-Api Hakka Association in 1965. Datuk Chong Fook Thien, then-President of the Hakka Association and one of school's founders, proposed the construction of its building. A committee was started with Datuk Pang Tet Chung as its chairperson. At the first meeting on 6 January 1965, the name \\"Sabah Tshung Tsin Secondary School\\" was decided. Soon afterwards, the school was approved by the state's Education Department and of land was granted for its construction. The federal Financial Department approved the exemption of income tax to those who funded the school. On 12 October 1965, the school obtained the title deed for the land and the construction of the school commenced. Sabah Tshung Tsin Secondary School opened on 25 January 1965, borrowing classrooms of the Chung Hwa School, Kota Kinabalu. 78 students were enrolled as the school's first students. The school was consequently accepted as a member of the Chinese Independent High School in Malaysia. =1966‚Äî1989: Development and growth= The hall in Tshung Tsin In 1967, the first permanent school building was opened by the then Chief Minister of Sabah, Tun Datu Mustapha. Around 670 students enrolled in the school. In 1968, the government implemented a higher graduation rate for primary school students whereby students can then easily enrol into public secondary schools. This significantly reduced the enrolment rate for independent schools throughout Malaysia. By 1974 there were only 24 students left in the school, and the school was at risk of being closed. The Api-Api Hakka Association decided to take action and had appointed a new management for the school. A new principal, Mr. Chang Yu On, was appointed in November 1974. Some professional Chinese teachers were also invited to teach in the school. The Hakka Association's efforts bore fruit in 1975 as the enrolment rate went up to 250 students for Junior One (Âàù‰∏≠), with 60 students for the Senior section (È´ò‰∏≠). In 1975, the school started classes for Senior 3 students, and for the first time participated in the government's Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM, Malaysian Education Certificate). Another 600 students were enrolled in the Junior section in 1976. Subsequently, the administrators decided to conduct an entrance examination to accept only the best students. The Hakka Association tried to implement improvements for the school, independent of the Government because of the discrimination against Chinese High Schools due to the New Economic Policy, an affirmative policy which was introduced by the Malaysian Federal Government in 1971 favouring the bumiputras. By the 1980s improvements had been made, and this included the construction of more school buildings. The new buildings included two permanent classroom buildings, a building for the school administrators, a garden inside the two new classroom buildings and the new school administrators building, a hall with a capacity of around 1000 students, a multi-purpose field, two basketball courts and a volleyball court. On 19 August 1982, a new five story building was opened, which provided a canteen on the ground floor, a computer lab on the second floor, and a library on the third and fourth floors. The fifth floor was used to provide accommodation for teachers for two years until a new teacher's hostel was opened in 1986. In 1984, as results for the students taking the Unified Examinations Certificate (UEC) were encouraging, the school decided to have classes for qualified students who were planning to further their studies in universities. A building was planned to be built in Menggatal, Sabah, but the school lost the land the new building was to build on due to the lost of the ruling party Barisan Nasional to the Parti Bersatu Sabah in the 1985 Sabah state election. In the end, the empty fifth floor of the five-story building was used instead for classes. Classes started in January 1987 with 152 students. The Pre-University class concept was well received and method of teaching was also lauded. In the same year, students who went for the A-Level and LCCI examinations organised by the University of Cambridge achieved good results, and this prompted the Hakka Association to raise funds to construct a building exclusively for the Pre-University students. In 1989, the building was opened by the then Chief Minister of Sabah, Datuk Pairin Kitingan. The Pre-University was known then as \\"Sabah Tshung Tsin Pre-University Centre\\" and today it is known as Institut Sinaran. =1989 ‚Äî today= The school's principal Chang Yu On died on 4 November 1989 of a heart attack at age 48. In 1991, the Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Sabah bestowed the honorary title \\"Datuk\\" to Chang Yu On posthumously to honour his contributions. The new principal was the then vice-principal Mr. Lau Suan Hok. In March 1990, Tsen Kui On and Hiew Hoh Shin were chosen as vice-principals of the school. During the tenure of Lau Suan Hok, air-conditioning was installed in classrooms and the library was expanded. Lau retired in 1996 and Tsen Kui On became principal. A seven-storey Co-curricular Activity Building was opened in December 1994. The canteen was moved to this building from the original five storey building, and two computer labs were added. The co-curricular activity offices were situated on the third floor. Music rooms, orchestral rehearsal facilities and photographic studios were also placed in this building. In 2005, the school forged sister school relationships with Lee Kau Yan Memorial School, Hong Kong and DongHwa High School, South Korea. The school also has forged relationships with secondary schools from foreign countries, such as Lee Kau Yan Memorial School & Yan Chai Hospital Wong Wha San Secondary School in Hong Kong. Due to the increase in enrolments, the Hakka Association proposed to build a new school campus in Menggatal. In 1998, the then Chief Minister of Sabah, Datuk Yong Teck Lee, approved a permit and a land title was received. Approximately of land was granted to the Hakka Association. The building planned is costly, and fund-raising is continuing. Phase 1 of the school's new campus is planned to be completed by early 2009. In 2008, Mr. Tsen retired as the principal of the school. As a result, Mr. Hiew was appointed as Acting Principal, and in 2009, Principal. In April 2017, a Rubber Running Track around the school football field was completed, making future Sports Days' Running events better by providing extra traction. In the same year, the school announced its plan to build a new 3-storey building in the middle of the garden in between the two classroom buildings and the school administrators' building. The new building, named TreeCube, has a recreational area on the ground floor and individual lockers for students. The second, third and fourth floors are offices for teachers, with the old staffrooms in the classrooms building becoming future classrooms for students. The building was completed by the end of 2017, just in time for the 2018 school year. A plea to the government was also applied for the Junior 3 students to be able to take Mathematics and Science in English for the compulsory public PT3 examination, as Mathematics and Science are usually taken with Bahasa Melayu as the official language. In July 2017, the plea was approved, with Junior 3 students able to take Mathematics and Science in English for PT3 starting from 2019. Fees The school fees ranges from RM4,017 to RM5215 per annum depending on which year the students are in. It does not includesinsurance, sports fees and the cost of living skill classes. Students who cannot afford the school fees can apply for financial assistance. Scholarships are available for pupils who score an overall A1 in the entrance examination, or those who achieve 7As in Ujian Penilaian Sekolah Rendah examination with an A2 in the entrance examination. Staff's children also benefit from reduced fees. The scholarship covers the fees for three years in the Junior section. Students that qualify for the financial help only pay between RM770 to RM825 annually. No scholarships are available for students in the Senior section. School fees in secondary schools run by the government in Malaysia are either free or the students are only charged a minimal amount. Due to the vast difference in fees between private and government-run schools (e.g. students attending Tshung Tsin pays approximately RM2000 a year in fees while students in government schools only around RM20 a year). ... Achievements The school has achieved a pass rate of 100% for both public examinations, SPM and PMR since 2001. Beside SPM and PMR, students at Tshung Tsin have to sit for the Chinese Independent Schools' Unified Examination Certificate (UEC) examination. In the 2006 result, Tshung Tsin had an overall pass rate of 96.17% in the senior section. A student of the school also won the Grand Prize of the 4th Japanese Speech Contest for Secondary School organised by The Japan Club of Kuala Lumpur, the Japanese Chamber of Trade & Industry Malaysia (JACTIM), the Embassy of Japan in Malaysia and the Japan Foundation Kuala Lumpur (JFKL). Facilities The school consists of three buildings for classrooms, two buildings as teachers' hostel, a fully air-conditioned hall (ÂÖÜÈæôÂ†Ç), a seven floor multi-purpose co-curriculum building, a 3 floor office building (TreeCube), four workshops for Living Skills, parking lots, a football field, two basketball courts and a volleyball court. =Co-curriculum building= The co-curricular activity building.

Younghusband is best known for his performances with the Philippines national team, playing from 2006 to 2019. He served as the captain of the national team from 2014 to 2019 and is the Philippines' most capped player and all-time top goalscorer. He helped the Philippines reach the semi-finals of the 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2018 AFF Championships as well as participating in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup‚Äîthe national team's first ever appearance in the tournament. Born in Surrey, England to an English father and Filipino mother, Younghusband joined the youth academy of Chelsea. He turned professional in 2005 with the Chelsea reserve team, and spent time on loan with Danish club Esbjerg fB. He moved to the Philippines in 2009, initially playing for San Beda before joining Loyola Meralco Sparks (later Meralco Manila) in 2011. Younghusband spent the majority of his professional career with Loyola Meralco Sparks, winning the United Football League Cup (UFL Cup) in 2013 and the PFF National Men's Club Championship in the 2014‚Äì15 season. A prolific goalscorer, he won the United Football League Golden Boot in 2012 as well as three consecutive UFL Cup Golden Boots from 2011 to 2013 and the UFL Cup Golden Ball in 2013. In 2017, he moved to Davao Aguilas where they finished as runners-up of the 2018 Copa Paulino Alcantara. Younghusband's older brother, James, is also a footballer. The brothers have been teammates for both club and country. Early years Younghusband was born in Ashford, Surrey, England, the son of Englishman Philip Younghusband Sr. and Filipina Susan Placer. His brother James Younghusband is also a footballer, playing as a midfielder. Club career =Chelsea= Younghusband turned professional in March 2005, having been at Chelsea since the age of nine. Younghusband was the youth team's top scorer in the 2003‚Äì04 season and made his first reserve start in November 2004. In the 2004‚Äì05 he was the youth team's top scorer. In the 2005‚Äì06 season, Younghusband made 21 appearances for the Chelsea reserve team, including 18 starts, and scored five goals. He also made one appearance as a substitute for the Chelsea youth team. =Loan to Esbjerg= On 30 August 2007, Younghusband signed a contract with Danish top-league club Esbjerg, going on loan with the Danes for the rest of the 2007‚Äì08 season but he returned to Chelsea during the January transfer window. During his time playing in the Chelsea reserves team, he scored 9 goals in 41 apps for two seasons. In the summer of 2008, his contract with Chelsea ended and he moved to the Philippines. =San Beda= On 15 April 2011, it was reported that Younghusband and his brother had announced that they would join San Beda for the 2011 National Club Championships under former national coach Aris Caslib. \\"It has been a long since we have been considered professional football players and we are very happy to have that opportunity again, especially in the Philippines.\\" =Loyola Meralco Sparks= Younghusband in 2013 On 19 August 2011, it was reported that Younghusband and his brother would be joining Loyola Meralco Sparks on three-year deals after the national club championship was over. On 15 October 2011, Younghusband made his debut for Loyola in the 2011 UFL Cup and fired a tournament-high seven goals in a 15‚Äì1 demolition of newcomer Team Socceroo FC. At the 2011 UFL Cup final, Loyola lost against the Philippine Air Force 2‚Äì0, although he won the Golden Boot Award with 25 goals in his 7 games. Younghusband made his league debut in a 3‚Äì2 win against Green Archers United against whom he scored a brace. Younghusband then went on to score the opening goal against Stallion FC but Loyola succumbed to a 4‚Äì1 defeat and Younghusband himself was sent off in the 79th minute. Younghusband missed the match against Global FC but scored the second goal against Kaya in a 2‚Äì0 victory. On 19 February, Younghusband scored his first league hat-trick plus two more goals in a 14‚Äì0 thrashing of Philippine Navy. After the United Football League resumed after the AFC Challenge Cup, Younghusband scored a goal in a 5‚Äì0 win over Manila Nomads. He then scored two goals against Philippine Air Force in a match which appeared to be heading to a 3‚Äì1 win to Loyola after 90 minutes, but Loyola gave away two goals in the last minute of added time and the match ended 3‚Äì3. Younghusband scored a goal in another 3‚Äì2 win over Green Archers United. He then continued his goalscoring form by scoring another hat-trick against Stallion and one against Kaya and afterwards scoring five goals in a 10‚Äì1 win over Philippine Navy. Loyola, however, went winless in their last three matches and lost out on the title race to Global with whom they drew with 1‚Äì1 on the last day of the season. Younghusband scored 23 league goals and 49 goals overall for Loyola in his first season. In the 2012 Singapore Cup, Younghusband scored the opening goal in a 3‚Äì1 victory over Burmese outfit Kanbawza which gave Loyola an advantage for the second leg. Younghusband was still with the club when it joined the inaugural season of the Philippines Football League in 2017 and renamed itself as F.C. Meralco Manila. After playing for the club for about six years, it was announced in July 2017 that Younghusband and his brother James is to be released by Meralco to join the Davao Aguilas in the then-upcoming transfer window. Meralco Manila attempted to had the Younghusbands agree to a contract transfer but they opted to move to the other club. =Davao Aguilas= Younghusband along with his brother James officially signed up to play for the Davao Aguilas on 2 August 2017. After Davao decided to dissolve its senior team in late 2018, Younghusband was reportedly in negotiations with Indonesian club PSIS Semarang in January 2019. International career Younghusband (leftmost) celebrates with teammates after scoring a goal for the Philippines national team in 2011 Early in 2005, the Philippine Football Federation was alerted to Younghusband's eligibility by an anonymous gamer who allegedly found out about their lineage via playing Football Manager. He and his older brother, James, were eventually called up to the Southeast Asian nation's football squad, amidst much fanfare. He played for the Philippines Under-23 national squad in the 2005 Southeast Asian Games. Younghusband scored two goals in the Philippines 4‚Äì2 loss to Malaysia. He was part of the seniors Philippine national team. Younghusband participated in the ASEAN Football Championship and scored six goals in four appearances and ended up top scorer in the qualifiers. During the 2012 AFC Challenge Cup Phil scored two goals against 2008 champion India in a 2‚Äì0 win, making it the first win by the Philippines against India ever. Younghusband scored again in a match against former champions Tajikistan that ended 2‚Äì1 to the Philippines, enabling the country to reach the semi-finals for the first time. The Philippines were matched against 2010 runners-up Turkmenistan in the semi- finals. Younghusband opened the scoring early on, but Turkmenistan eventually struck back twice, winning the match 2‚Äì1. Because of this, the Philippines were relegated to a battle for third place against Palestine. The match eventually ended in a 4‚Äì3 win for them with two goals from Phil Younghusband. He eventually won the golden boot award after scoring six goals in the whole tournament. The third-place finish marked the best achievement for the Philippines since the years of the Far Eastern Games. In a World Cup qualifier match against Bahrain held on 11 June 2015, Younghusband played in the midfield position. Younghusband scored his 50th goal through a penalty kick in the Philippines' 2‚Äì1 win over Tajikistan in their last 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualifier match on 27 March 2018 joining the list of footballers who have scored 50 international goals. The win led to the Philippines' qualification for its first AFC Asian Cup in 2019. Younghusband played in all three group stage matches of the Philippines' in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup but came in as a substitute in all matches. Retirement On 18 November 2019, Younghusband announced his retirement from football through his Instagram account. Personal life Phil Younghusband has been married to Margaret Hall since July 2019. They got engaged in December 2017, with Younghusband proposing for them to get married on Christmas Day. The two held their wedding in England. Hall is a Filipino-Scottish model.

As the aeroplane gains speed during takeoff the wing generates an increasing amount of lift although not enough to raise the aeroplane off the ground. The lift reduces the weight supported by the aeroplane‚Äôs main wheels and this reduces the main wheels‚Äô contribution to directional stability, allowing the nose wheel to destabilise the aeroplane‚Äôs direction along the ground. This form of wheelbarrowing is easily avoided by the pilot applying back-pressure to the elevator control during the takeoff roll to reduce the weight supported by the nose wheel. Depending on the severity of the wheel-barrowing, damage to the aircraft can be quite extensive: The propeller of a single engine airplane may strike the ground, damaging it and the engine. A wing can be damaged by striking the ground as the aircraft pivots over the nose-wheel and one main wheel. Wheel- barrowing may also be caused with a tricycle gear when the turn radius is too sharp for the speed of the aircraft on the ground - much like a child on a tricycle taking too sharp a turn.

It can be used to predict and diagnose errors occurring on machinery. Ferrography is related to tribology, which is the study of friction between interacting surfaces. Since the advent of ferrography in the 1970s it has been used in many industrial settings as a form of preventative maintenance.  History  Ferrography was pioneered in the 1970s by the late Vernon C. Westcott to help the United States military diagnose problems related to bearing failure before the issues became deadly. At the time, the best method of analysis could not detect small particles, so by the time the military found problems it was too late to find solutions. The military reached out to Mr. Westcott to find a way to solve this problem and from that Mr. Westcott developed the first ferrograph. The ferrograph first saw major use by the United Kingdom to detect helicopter failure in the Falklands War. Purpose & Uses  Ferrography is a staple in failure prevention maintenance. Continuous monitoring of the lubricating oil allows a change from expensive and often unnecessary preplanned maintenance to the more cost-effective failure prevention. Ferrography is unique because it can deliver information about enclosed parts as lubricating oil circulates through these areas and is still accessible. Rinsing vital components with particle free lubricant and analyzing the output can offer a detailed report of machine wear without disassembling anything. Since its initial application in the military, ferrography has been found to be helpful in * ships * coal mining * diesel engines * gas turbines in the aerospace industry * agricultural industry * naval aircraft = Further applications = Applying the idea of ferrography in other fields, techniques have been found to analyze wear outside of lubricating oil and of particles that do not carry magnetic properties. These uses have been found in processing grease samples, gas emissions; and in examining wear on arthritic joints. In arthritic joints, residue from bone-on-bone contact can be found in fluid near the joint and analyzed using direct-reading ferrography which can give information regarding rate of decline in the joint. As of November 2016, minimal information is available regarding further uses of ferrography.  Types  = Analytical ferrography = Analytical ferrography works through magnetic separation of contaminant particles and a professional analysis of the particles. A sample of the machine's lubricating oil is taken and diluted, then run across a glass slide. This glass slide is then placed on a magnetic cylinder that attracts the contaminants. Non-magnetic contaminants remain distributed across the slide from the wash. These contaminants are then washed, to remove excess oil, heated to 600 ¬∞F for two minutes, and the slide is analyzed under a microscope. After analysis, the particles will be ranked according to size. Particles over 30 microns in size are considered \\"abnormal\\" and indicate severe wear. Particles are divided into six categories, with an additional five subcategories under ferrous wear: * copper * white nonferrous: usually aluminum or chromium * babbitt: particles containing tin and lead * contaminants: do not change appearance after heating, usually dirt * fibers: typically from filters * ferrous wear: magnetic particles that are attracted to the magnetic cylinder ** high alloy: rarely found on ferrograms ** low alloy ** cast iron ** dark metallic oxides: darkness indicates oxidation ** red oxides Being able to identify different particles can prove to be invaluable, because the prominence of certain particles can point to specific locations of wear. Furthermore, the presence of particles that do not make contact with the lubricating oil can uncover contamination. This kind of analysis required a trained professional and can be prohibitively expensive for smaller operations. = Direct-reading method = Direct-reading ferrography is a more mathematical approach to ferrography. Essentially, the buildup on the glass slide is measured by shining a light across the slide. The blockage of the light by the buildup of particles is then used, over time, to calculate an average. An increase in blockage indicates higher amounts of machine wear. This method is less expensive, as expert analysis is not required, and can be automated. However, once an issue is identified, less information is available to diagnose the problem.  Limitations  While ferrography is an effective tool for wear analysis, it does come with several limitations. Ferrography is a very expensive procedure because of the specialized and sophisticated instruments required. Ferrography stands out among oil analysis methods because of the magnetic element involved. This allows for a more detailed report that similar methods cannot produce. Additionally, for the qualitative approach that is analytical ferrography, experts are needed to make sense of the raw output. Furthermore, ferrography cannot solve problems, only bring attention to them. These issues then need to be dealt with on their own.

He was the 14th Prime Minister of Luxembourg, serving for a year, from 20 March 1925 until 16 July 1926. Early life Pr√ºm was born in Troisvierges, in the far north of the Grand Duchy, on 9 July 1886.Thewes (2011), p. 91 His father, √âmile Pr√ºm, was a fervent Roman Catholic and a prominent conservative politician, and this greatly affected his political outlook. He and his brother Emmanuel were sent to university at Leuven, where he joined K.A.V. Lovania Leuven, a Catholic fraternity. While his brother became a priest, Pierre trained as a lawyer. Like his father, he sought political office, and entered politics himself, representing the canton of Clervaux in the Chamber of Deputies.Thewes (2003), p.91 As a conservative, he joined the Party of the Right (PD) when it was founded, in 1914. However, Pr√ºm left the Party of the Right in 1918 to form his own party, the Independent National Party (PNI). Government In 1925, the PNI seized upon the inability of the PD government to pass railway reforms.Thewes (2003), p.88 In the legislative elections of 1 March, the ruling Party of the Right lost its majority in the Chamber of Deputies, winning only 22 of the 47 seats. Unwilling to form a coalition with any parties that had blocked its railway reforms, Pr√ºm was invited to form a government, provided that he could form a majority coalition. Taking in an eclectic collection of Radical Socialists and dissident conservatives, with the additional informal backing of the Socialist Party, Pr√ºm's government took office on 20 March. Pr√ºm sought to improve relations with France and Germany, which had been alienated by the formation of the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union in 1921. On 9 October, Pr√ºm negotiated a working arrangement on the co-ordination of iron production in France and Luxembourg.Thewes (2003), p.89 At the same time, the Locarno Treaties were signed between seven European states (not including Luxembourg); the treaties confirmed the inviolability of the borders redrawn by the Treaty of Versailles. These two arrangements would go a considerable distance towards calming the tensions over Luxembourg that had flared up during and after the First World War. When the government turned its attention back to domestic affairs, it did not fare so well. The Socialist Party had supported Pr√ºm throughout 1925, despite not being rewarded with a cabinet position. As a mark of its debt to the Socialists, in May 1926, the government sought to introduce a bill improving working conditions.Thewes (2003), p.90 The Liberals, who predominantly represented employers and the professional class, were angered, and withdrew their support for the government. Without a majority, Pr√ºm tendered his resignation to Grand Duchess Charlotte on 22 June. After the premiership In 1926, Pr√ºm became a justice of the peace in Clervaux, where he served for ten years. In the 1937 election, Pr√ºm was elected to the Chamber of Deputies once again, representing the Nord constituency. When Nazi Germany occupied Luxembourg in 1940, he left the pro-Nazi Society for German Literature and Art (GEDELIT). After the war, he was prosecuted for collaborationism, and was sentenced on 28 November 1946 to four years imprisonment. He died on 1 February 1950 in Clervaux.

Family WB Hartland's grandfather, Richard Hartland (1745-1821), came to Ireland from the Kew Botanic Gardens in 1776 to become the gardener to the Earl of Kingston at Mitchelstown where he remained until 1785. Richard Hartland established a nursery at Belview, Mallow, in 1787. Each of Richard Hartland's three sons operated nurseries in County Cork: Arthur Hartland established a nursery at Turner's Cross, Richard Hartland Jr the Lough Nursery, and William Hartland (d.1843) operated the Mallow business. The latter relocated the business to Cork in 1810. In turn, William Hartland's two sons, William Baylor Hartland (1836‚Äì1912) and Henry Albert Hartland (1840-1893) became respectively a plantsman and artist. Career From 1878, WB Hartland operated a nursery at Temple Hill, before moving the business a short distance to Ard Cairn, Ballintemple, in 1890. His bulb farm was approximately . Hartland sent flowers from his farm to various markets, including the one at Covent Garden. He also maintained the \\"Old Established Garden Seed Ware-House\\" at 24 Patrick Street, Cork. Hartland was a Guardian of the Cork Union and started a scheme of prizes for country plots. He called attention to the need for agricultural education and advocated the growing of early vegetables and flowers along the southern Irish seaboard. He was also a florist and seedsman who was a supplier to Queen Victoria. He was awarded Silver Banksian Medal by the Royal Horticultural Society in London May 1903. Collection and legacy Hartland began collecting bulbs around 1880, often acquiring them from old Irish gardens. While no species of narcissus is native to Ireland, the climatic conditions have proven favourable for the appearance of self-sown seeding varieties over a long period. In the 19th century, collectors in Ireland, such as Hartland and Fanny Currey, discovered narcissus varieties which were unknown elsewhere. For example, Hartland found the 'Bishop Mann' variety in an old garden of the Dioceses of St. Finbarr's, where Bishop Mann had been the last resident. The bulbs had been planted 150 years before at Bishopstown, now a suburb of Cork. Hartland's first daffodil catalogue was A little book of daffodils nearly 100 varieties as offered and collected by W.B.Hartland. The early catalogues were whimsical, and did not always find favour with the horticultural establishment. His niece, Gertrude Hartland, illustrated many of his catalogues, including the influential Floral Album of Daffodils (1890) and later editions. The catalog for 1907-8 includes a list of old Irish apples entitled 'old lamps for new lamps'. In 1890, Hartland located an old species now known as 'Ard Cairn Russet', a late keeping apple, and sent samples to the Royal Horticultural Society. He also collected tulips from Irish gardens and introduced the 'Mrs. Moon' variety. Outside of gardening, Hartland is known for producing a colourful tourist guide after a trip to the west of Ireland. He is also remembered by the naming of the Hartland's Avenue/Road area of Cork City in Lough Parish, the location of one of his nurseries.

He is best known as a novelist and for his songwriting partnership with Jacques Dutronc. Early life Lanzmann spent the early part of his life in Auvergne. His parents, Paulette (Grobermann) and Armand Lanzmann,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/05/claude-lanzmann-obituary divorced shortly before World War II and, at the age of 12, he became a farmhand. Lanzmann was Jewish and, following the Battle of France, he, his mother and his siblings, pretended to be Moroccan Arabs in order to escape persecution by the Vichy regime. In 1943, Lanzmann and his elder brother Claude (later a noted documentary-maker) joined the Communist resistance. Jacques was taken captive by the Germans and was due to be executed by firing squad, but escaped. Lanzmann's father was one of the leading local figures in the rival Mouvements Unis de la R√©sistance, but Jacques and Claude were not aware of this until February 1944. After the war, Lanzmann worked in Paris as builder and a welder, and showed promise as a painter. During the early 1950s, he moved to Chile for two years, where he worked as a copper miner. Literary career =Early novels and editorship of Lui= While Lanzmann was in Chile, a manuscript of a novel he had written, La glace est rompue (\\"The ice is broken\\"), was given to Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir by his brother Claude. Claude was, at this time, in a romantic relationship with Beauvoir. This intervention led to the publication of the novel in 1954. Lanzmann's second novel, Le Rat d'Am√©rique, published in 1956, was inspired by his experiences in Chile. Its commercial success led to him being offered a job as a critic for the Communist literary magazine Les Lettres fran√ßaises, edited by Louis Aragon. He was sent by the magazine to the Soviet Union to report on the literary scene there. On his return, he wrote a third novel, Cuir de Russe, published in 1957, which depicted the extreme poverty of Russian peasants that he had witnessed during his visit. The novel was considered a betrayal by the French Communist Party, and Lanzmann was expelled. Lanzmann continued to write novels and, in 1959, wrote his first adapted screenplay, Le Travail c'est la libert√© (\\"Work is Freedom\\"). Between 1960 and 1962 he was a journalist for L'Express. In 1963, he adapted his novel Le Rat d'Am√©rique as a screenplay for the film Rat Trap, starring Charles Aznavour. In the same year, he was approached by Daniel Filipacchi to edit a new men's magazine Lui, a post which he held until 1968. =Pop music= In 1966, Jacques Wolfsohn of Disques Vogue asked Lanzmann to work with pop composer Jacques Dutronc to create songs for a beatnik singer called Benjamin. Benjamin released an EP in 1966, featuring songs written with Dutronc and a Lanzmann-Dutronc composition, \\"Cheveux longs\\" (Long Hair). However, Wolfsohn was disappointed by Benjamin's recording of a song titled \\"Et moi, et moi, et moi\\". A second version was recorded, with Dutronc's former bandmate Hadi Kalafate on vocals. Wolfsohn then asked Dutronc if he would be interested in recording his own version. The single reached number 2 in the French charts in September 1966. Lanzmann, sometimes working with his wife Anne Segalen, wrote the words for most of Dutronc's output between 1966 and 1980. Dutronc's self-titled debut album, released at the end of 1966, sold over a million copies and was awarded a special Grand Prix du Disque by the Acad√©mie Charles Cros, in memoriam of one of its founders. A second single, \\"Les play boys\\", spent six weeks at number one and sold 600,000 copies. Dutronc was one of the most commercially successful French music stars of the late 1960s and early 1970s. During that period, he released seven hit albums and more than 20 singles, including two further number ones: \\"J'aime les filles\\" in 1967 and \\"Il est cinq heures, Paris s'√©veille\\" in 1968. During the recording of the 1980 album Guerre et pets (\\"War and Farts\\" - a play on the title of Tolstoy's novel), Wolfsohn proposed that Dutronc write with both Jacques Lanzmann and Serge Gainsbourg. He suggested to the two that they each work on alternative lyrics to go with one of Dutronc's instrumental demos. Lanzmann objected to being placed in competition against another writer, and dropped out of the project.Michel Leydier (2010). Jacques Dutronc: La Bio. Paris: Seuil, p. 185 The resulting album consequently only includes two Lanzmann-Dutronc compositions, and is mainly written by Dutronc and Gainsbourg.Michel Leydier (2010). Jacques Dutronc: La Bio. Paris: Seuil, p. 187 In 2003, Dutronc and Lanzmann reunited for Madame l'existence, an album described by rock critic Christophe Conte as \\"surpassing, without much apparent effort, everything that [Dutronc] has created in the last two decades\\". Lanzmann has also worked on songs for a number of other artists, including Johnny Hallyday, Fran√ßoise Hardy and Petula Clark. In 1969, he wrote the French adaptation of the musical Hair. =Literary career after 1968= After leaving Lui in 1968, Lanzmann co-founded a publishing company, Les Editions Sp√©ciales, with Jean-Claude Latt√®s. This was originally intended as a niche publishing venture for fiction and non-fiction linked to current affairs but, after Lanzmann sold his interest to Latt√®s in 1974, the company was renamed JC Latt√®s and became a more general publishing firm. Today, it is and imprint of Hachette and the French language publisher for authors such as Dan Brown, John Grisham and E. L. James. Lanzmann subsequently founded the publishing company Jacques Lanzmann et Seghers Editeurs. During the 1970s, Lanzmann wrote a number of best-selling novels and became a professional gambler. He won the prestigious Prix RTL Grand Public in 1977 for his novel Le T√™tard. Lanzmann presented programmes on the television channel Voyage from 1997 until his death. Personal life Lanzmann was married four times and had seven children. He was a keen traveler and walker. He crossed nearly all of the world's deserts, and explored the Sahara Desert at the age of 19. He came close to death while crossing the Taklamakan Desert in 1990. While crossing the Sinai Desert in 1985 he was arrested by Egyptian soldiers on suspicion of spying. In his suitcase, he had a cutting of a Le Monde profile dedicated to him, and was able to secure his release by using this to prove his identity. He died on 21 June 2006, aged 79, in Paris and his funeral was held on 26 June at the P√®re-Lachaise cemetery. French President Jacques Chirac paid tribute, saying: \\"His brilliant songs left an imprint on their era. They will remain for a long time in the hearts of the French.\\"  Bibliography  * La Glace est rompue * Le Rat d'Am√©rique (1956) * Cuir de Russie (1957) * Les Passagers du Sidi-Brahim (1958) * Un tyran sur le sable (1959) * Viva Castro (1959) * Qui vive!

Description The Western pygmy perch is a small fish with a olive, brown and green mottled body with tow orange stripes along the flanks. In the breeding season the males develop brighter colouration with golden mottling along the flanks, an reddish-orange abdomen and the fins darken. The females develop a bluish colour when breeding. It can reach TL. Distribution The Western pygmy perch is endemic to the south- wester coastal drainages of Western Australia. Its range extends from the Waychinicup River east of Albany to the Arrowsmith River north of Perth. It occurs in the majority of the river drainages within its range, as well as in lakes near the south coast. Habitat and biology The Western pygmy perch is found predominantly in lakes, streams, and swamps, and can withstand a degree of brackishness. They have a preference for living among vegetation in the shallows around the water perimeter, and acclimatise readily to a range of water temperatures from almost 0 to 25 ¬∞C. Pygmy perch are egg layers. They produce eggs singly, laying 12 to 15 over a period of up to three hours. During the breeding season (July to November), both sexes become noticeably more colorful. The eggs measure around 1.2 mm and are slightly adhesive, which allows them to cling to submerged plants, rocks, or debris. Spawning usually occurs in the latter part of the morning.Hatching occurs after around three days from laying. The 3-mm larvae look quite different from juveniles of the species and have no mouth for several days, but are recognizably perch-like after around 27 to 30 days. This species is mainly carnivorous, they eat various dipteran larvae, including mosquitos, ostracods, and copepods, and small quantities of algae, and are adept at taking mosquitoes from the surface of the water. They attain sexual maturity at one year old, and can live as long as 5 years. Photo by Jim Owens Western pygmy perch larva Uses Pygmy perch may be safely kept in an aquarium along with tropical fish. They are considered safe with tadpoles, so are used in frog ponds to control mosquito larvae.

His most important achievements are in the field of Roman law. Life and career Otto Lenel was born in Mannheim, Germany on 13 December 1849. He was the son of Moritz Lenel and Caroline Scheuer. He fought in the war against France in 1870/71. Lenel studied law at the universities of Heidelberg, Leipzig and Berlin. In 1872, he received the degree of Dr. jur., four years later, he obtained the habilitation at the University of Leipzig. In 1882, Lenel became famous, when he won a prize which had been offered by the Bavarian Academy of Sciences with his reconstruction of the edict of the praetors (see below). In the same year of 1882, Lenel became a professor at the University of Kiel. Two years later, he moved on to the University of Marburg. In 1885 he became a professor taught at the University of Strassburg, which had become a German institution after the war of 1870/71 in which Lenel himself had fought. In 1895, he was rector of the University of Strassburg. 1907 he was called to Freiburg University. He soon became one of the most important German legal historians of his time. At the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the award of his Dr. jur. degree, he was presented with a Festschrift.Festschrift f√ºr Otto Lenel zum f√ºnfzigj√§hrigen Doctorjubil√§um am 16. Dezember 1921 √ºberreicht von der Rechts- und Staatswissenschaftlichen Fakult√§t der Universit√§t Freiburg i. Br., Leipzig, 1923. Ten years later, Lenel was given a second Festschrift.Symbolae Friburgenses in honorem Ottonis Lenel.Otto Lenel zu seinem sechzigj√§hrigen Doktorjubil√§um am 16. Dezember 1931 von Freiburger Mitarbeitern und Sch√ºlern, Leipzig 1931 On his 80th birthday, Lenel received a gratulatory letter, which was signed by academics representing 20 countries of various continents and 100 universities. He was also made an honorary citizen of the city of Freiburg. After 1933, however, Lenel‚Äîin spite of his international fame, his status as a veteran and his old age‚Äîbecame a victim of Nazi racism. His daughter was forced out of her job as a nurse. The prosecutions by the Nazis broke his spirit. For the last 18 months of his life he was unable to continue his scholarly work. He died on 7 February 1935. According to his wish, only his closest relatives attended his burial. Due to the political circumstances, no obituary was published in Germany. After Lenel's death, the members of his family met a cruel fate in Nazi Germany: His widow of more than 80 years of age, Luise, n√©e Eberstadt (born 25 February 1857 in Frankfurt) and his daughter Bertha Lenel (born 7 March 1882 in Freiburg) were sent on 22 October 1940 to an internment camp in Gurs, France. The widow died there on 7 November 1940, Bertha Lenel survived. On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Otto Lenel's death, a sign was affixed to his last residence at Holbeinstrasse 5 in Freiburg, Germany. Work Lenel is best known for his reconstruction of the fundamental text of the Roman legal system, the so-called edictum perpetuum of the Roman praetors. The praetors were the government officials responsible for the administration of justice during the Roman republic and the principate. The edictum (or edict) was the text in which the newly elected praetor announced how he would handle his responsibilities. More precisely, the edict announced, under what circumstances it would succeed and when it would fail. Originally, every praetor drafted his own edict, but over time, a standard text was established, which was regularly re-enacted by the new praetor. Even later, Emperor Hadrian commissioned a final redaction of the text and prohibited any further changes. The edict had thus changed its nature from being an announcement by the praetor himself to being a legal rule binding on the praetor himself, which made known to all citizens under what circumstances they could bring a successful action in the Roman courts. This text is called the edictum perpetuum (the eternal edict). In later times, the edict lost its legal importance due to changes in procedural law. For that reason, the edict of the edict was no longer copied and no complete text has come down to us. Similarly, most of the writings of the Roman jurists have only been conserved in fragments in Justinian's digest. Lenel reconstructed both the text of the edict and tried to establish the order in which the surviving fragments of legal writings had originally been presented before they were cut out and rearranged in the digest. The reconstruction of the edict is the subject of his book Das edictum perpetuum. The results of his research on the writings of the Roman jurists are contained in the two volumes entitled Palingenesia juris civilis. The subjects of the two books are linked, because many books by Roman jurists were commentaries on the edict or at least they followed the structure of the edict. By studying the structure of the scholarly writings of the jurists Lenel found out how the edict was structured and what provisions it contained. Lenel's work is extremely important for the history of Roman law. It enables modern scholars to consider the original context of the source texts and it helps us understand the technicalities of Rome's legal system. In addition to his famous works on Roman law Lenel also published some influential papers on modern German civil law.

It can reduce fuel consumption by as much as 30 percent. The Mitsubishi Fuso Aero Star Eco Hybrid operates with a series hybrid drive, in which the diesel engine does not drive wheels directly but instead is used solely to drive an electrical generator to recharge lithium-ion batteries, connected to the two electric motor (with a combined output of 158 kW), which propel the vehicle. Daimler Trucks uses such a system for most of its full-hybrid commercial vehicles, including in the Mitsubishi Fuso Canter Eco Hybrid, while series hybrids are reserved for urban buses, where they work most efficiently.

He is notable for his creative freestyle skiing movies and professional accomplishments. He first caught the attention of the world of outdoor and action sports by jumping Chad's Gap, a massive transfer jump of from take-off to landing over a deep gully in Alta, Utah, US. His point of view videos routinely go viral on the internet and are viewed by millions. He is widely considered to be one of the best freeskiers in the history of the sport.  Biography  =Early years= Candide Thovex was born 22 May 1982(37) in Annecy, in the Haute-Savoie area of France, and grew up in the village of La Clusaz. He learned to ski at age 2.5 in the Aravis region of the French Alps. As a 4-year-old, he began building little jumps behind his house, and at 5 he joined the local skier club where he developed a passion for Mogul skiing. He was 14 when he won his first French National Junior Championships in the mogul division. Even from a young age, he was described by those close to him as \\"skiing with flair and innovation\\". He is the brother of snowboarder Mirabelle Thovex. =Professional skiing (1997‚Äì2007 the freestyle years)= In 1997 Candide signed his first professional sponsorship contract with leading Australian action sports brand Quiksilver. In 2000 Candide returned to the United States to compete in the Gravity Games in Mammoth, California, where he won the Big Air contest. He made his second visit to Chad's Gap and cleanly landed a D-spin 720 the first major rotation over a gap. From there 'the flying Frenchman' went on to win the Big Air division, his first gold medal at a Winter X-Games in the process. Unfortunately his season ended with Candide blowing the cruciate ligaments in his left knee. In the spring of 2001 Candide was invited to ride at Superpark 3 in Mammoth, California. Candide proceeded to impress his peers by sticking the 'jump heard around the world'; a 110-foot (33.5 meter) cork 540 tail grab. On the contest side of things, Candide won the Halfpipe and Big Air contests at that year's X Games in Australia. Candide's injury from the previous season had left him with plenty of down time. He took advantage of that to launch his career as a filmmaker and created 'WW Prod'. That same year his first production company went on to release the first of 8 films under the 'Rastafaride' title, selling more than 10 000 DVDs of the first video worldwide. He was also voted 'Skier of the Year' by the European specialized media. 2002 was a very busy year. Candide was constantly filming with his own production company and with others. He continued competing and his contest results remained solid, dominating the Big Air events, winning two in New Zealand, one in Lebanon and another in Switzerland. He earned 2 podiums at the US Open; 2nd place in Superpipe, and 3rd place in Slopestyle. In 2003 according to the Association of Freeskiing Professionals, \\"Candide Thovex and CR Johnson change the face of halfpipe skiing at Winter X Games in Aspen, Colorado by going bigger than any of the snowboarders.\\"http://www.afpworldtour.com/rfs/clients/afp/resources/HistoryofFreeskiing_Timeline.pdf Candide won his second X-Games gold medal.Superpipe stunner in Aspen This time it was in Superpipe, an incredible achievement, since he couldn't practice at home because at the time there weren't any superpipes in Europe. Candide celebrated by hosting the first ever 'Candide Invitational' at his home resort, La Clusaz. The event gathered the world's best freestylers for a few days of fun and to explore the limits of what could be done on a pair of skis. He also signed a sponsorship deal to develop a pro model with Salomon. This was another season that ended with another injury to his cruciate ligaments, but this time in his right knee. In 2004 Candide continued to push back the boundaries of his sport, performing the first ever '810¬∞ to rail' and cementing his reputation as the master of all 'new school' tricks and techniques. He was part of Powder's Reader Poll in 2004 where he was placed 6th. In 2005 the Candide Invitational event was voted best European freestyle event by the international specialised press. The same season Candide inked a multi-year deal with Rossignol to become the leading ambassador for their 'Scratch' program. In 2006 Candide decided to see how high it was possible to fly on skis. To do so, he helped to design and build one of the largest quarter-pipes ever and proceeded to set a world record with a jump of 33 feet (about 10 meters) above the coping. 2007 was a year of highs and lows; Candide won his third gold medal at 2007 in Slopestyle, with a record score of 95/100. However, he ended his season coming up short on 'The Big Bertha', another over-the-top jump he'd dreamed up, which resulted in a fracture to his L1 vertebrae. At first, doctors thought he might never be able to ski again or at least that he would never ski at the same level as before; no more tricks, no more big airs. =Professional skiing (2008‚Äì2018 big mountain freestyle and filmmaking)= Returning from injury in 2008, Candide signed on to ride for Coreupt skis. He also put all his energy into his event, designing features of all shapes and sizes to blend in perfectly with the terrain. At the same time, he started skiing again, but only in perfect powder and far from the crowds. He rode alone, with the exception of his sole companion, Simon Favier who was there to capture all of the action on film. He didn't compete in a single contest. He was simultaneously putting together his first documentary feature 'The Candide Invitational Story',. The final product of his adventures riding and filming with Simon Favier was entitled 'Candide Kamera' and was released in 2009. The images were focused exclusively on riding in the backcountry and big mountain freestyle. Wanting to continue in the same vein, Candide spent the entire season riding powder and filming. After winning a number of major freestyle contests, 2010 marked a sensational return to competition, but now Candide had turned his sights on unspoiled and unforgiving backcountry faces. However, he wanted to keep things discreet since he hadn't competed since his injury. His comeback started with an invitation to compete in the Red Bull Line Catcher in Vars, France, a prestigious hybrid event, which blends freestyle and freeriding. He was nervous and unsure of his ability to keep up with the other competitors. In spite of his uncertainties, he went on to win the contest. A few weeks later, Candide Thovex was invited to and won the Chamonix stage of the Freeride World Tour (FWT). The win in Chamonix was a deciding factor that convinced him to compete on the tour for the entire season. He finished in second place at the following event. At the last event of the season, the Verbier Xtreme on the face of the infamous Bec des Rosses in Switzerland, Candide laid down a solid run for an equal 3rd-place finish. The result was just enough to clinch the title of World Freeride Champion. Candide's fascination with the art of filmmaking has always entertained him. Over the course of his professional career he has starred in, and produced numerous videos. Including numerous video segments, Candide starred in WW production's Rastafaride 7th Heaven. In 2011, he set to work on a project to document his past with an eye on what the future held in store for him. He skied and filmed the best backcountry conditions available on the planet. The film 'Few Words' was released in 2012. It was an immediate success. The French cable TV channel Canal+ immediately purchased the exclusive rights to the film in Candide's home country for a period of 2 years, showing it a countless number of times. It was also a bestseller worldwide on iTunes, and in 2013 received the highest honors on offer at the renowned Powder Awards put on by the American ski magazine of the same name; best male performance, best documentary, best cinematography, and the most prestigious of all, the \\"Full Throttle\\" award for the most outstanding all around performance of the season. The film was also played to sold out theatres on a 24-country world tour. The same year, Candide joined forces with Faction Skis to develop a complete range of signature models; meanwhile all the products in his signature model line with longtime sponsor Quiksliver continued to be best sellers. Candide decided to devote his 2013 season to producing a new video entitled 'One of Those Days' filmed almost exclusively with his helmet-mounted camera. Filmed entirely from his point of view, 'One of Those Days' (OOTD) was claimed by Powder magazine editor John Clary Davies \\"The best skier on the planet at his home hill. This is the most fun I‚Äôve ever had skiing and all I did was sit in my office and press play. Movie of the Year. Edit of the Century. Done\\". Released in January 2015, 'One of Those Days 2' pushed the boundaries even further. The video was viewed by more than 1.3 million people per day in the first week, and more than 13 million times in less than 1 month alone. The international media also picked up on the story with articles and video embeds on major websites such as The Telegraph (GB), BBC (GB), The Independent (GB), USA Today (USA), Sports Illustrated (USA), Outdoor (USA), Fox Sports (USA), Stern (GER), Mundo Deportivo (SPA), Paris Match (FRA), l‚ÄôEquipe (FRA), and Le Point (FRA). Candide has also made live appearances on CNN and France's Canal+ to talk about the video, which has also featured in other televised reports on TF1, France2, and M6 in France, as well as 1TV in Russia, and on the leading European sports channel, Eurosport. On 8 December 2015, Candide released an advertorial film for Audi to promote their latest Quattro Q7 model. The video, created, produced and directed by Candide, featured Candide skiing and performing tricks on many surfaces including dirt, grass, fallen leaves and asphalt, but no snow. It was viewed over 1 million times on the first day on Candide's YouTube channel. It was viewed 2.5 million times in the first 3 days and has been viewed over 7.5 million times since being posted to his official YouTube and Facebook accounts. Powder, a reference in the sport of skiing summed it up simply on the website of the magazine: \\"Candide doesn‚Äôt need snow\\". On 21 January 2016, Google released a video entitled: 'Explore Mont Blanc with Kilian Jornet, Ueli Steck, Candide Thovex, and Google Maps' to promote the Street View of Mont Blanc in Google Maps. In the first 4 months it was viewed over 2.6 million times. Google describes the list of individuals who took part in the project as \\"legendary adventurers\\". Candide's role in the project was to help build a jump on top of the Mont Blanc and then perform tricks off of it. It is a feat that French travel and photo magazine GEO says on their website is \\"unprecedented\\". In an interview posted on the website of French lifestyle magazine Paris Match, Candide said it was \\"the hardest jump of my life\\". On its website, the top French ski magazine Skieur called it \\"another first for Candide Thovex\\" and described him as a \\"true ambassador of skiing\\". On the Powder magazine website the article covering the event called Candide a \\"skiing legend\\". On 23 February 2016, Candide released 'One of Those Days 3', the last in the series of his point of view (POV) ski videos. For the last chapter in the trilogy the production values were higher and a police chase scenario ran through the film. Like the first two, the third episode went viral rapidly with over 6 million views in the first 3 months. France's TF1 network titled their web article 'The virus that is contaminating the web'. On the websites of French media outlets such as 20 Minutes, La D√©p√™che, and France Info all featured pieces on the video calling Candide \\"the king of freestyle\\". The international press took interest in the release. In their online editions, magazine's like GEO (FRA) and Adventure Journal (USA) as well as The Daily Telegraph (UK) newspaper all made comparisons between Candide and James Bond. The international news network CNN covered the video release as well. The website article took particular interest in Candide jumping over a helicopter with its rotors turning. It quotes Candide saying, \\"I don't think I would do it again. It was definitely kind of scary. You don't want to finish like a ham.\\" The article then goes on to confirm that, \\"As well as not ending up like a ham, he also jumped over a paraglider and a peloton of cyclists, skied across a lake and water-skied behind a helicopter in his latest YouTube edit\\". In the specialized ski press, Powder (USA) magazine said, \\"The third installment of One of Those Days might be the best yet, as Candide Thovex outdoes himself again, setting the bar in ski edit creativity\\". After praising the first two edits, Elemental Adventure (UK) expressed the same sentiment on their website, \\"This time Candide raised the bar to another level\\". Mountain sports website, Mountain Watch (AUS) called it, \\"quite likely the greatest ski video ever\\". Mashable, the global, multi-platform media and entertainment company presented it on their website as \\"the most insane ski video ever created\\". Pitch (UK), a leading independent sports and entertainment marketing agency stated, \\"Singlehandedly Thovex is taking freesking into the mainstream and cementing himself as a household name in the process\\". Following the success of One of Those Days 3, Candide created a competition where the public was asked to try to emulate his style of skiing, filming and editing. He called it \\"One of Your Days\\". The contestants posted videos to the contest website. Candide chose his 10 favorites, and the public had the final vote. The winner, Carter McMillan was awarded with a day skiing with Candide at his home mountain of La Clusaz, France. On 5 and 6 March Candide participated in a promotional event organized by FISE in China. 11 and 12 March 2016 Candide competed in the 3rd edition of the B&E; Invitational in Les Arcs, France. It was his only contest appearance of the year. He won 2 of the 5 categories on offer, taking the prize for the Beatcan Best Line, and was named the E-Adrenaline Public Choice Winner. The edit of Candide's performance at the event posted on his Facebook page has been viewed over 1.7 million times. In October 2016, 'Candide Thovex ‚Äì quattro' filmed by Simon Favier and directed by Candide won two prizes at the Top/Com Grands Prix Consumer 2016 awards held at the Congr√®s de la Communication Consumer (Conference on Consumer Communication) in Paris. The competition rewards the best advertisements and advertising campaigns of the year in France in a variety of categories. The film won the best 'Publicit√© on Line' (On Line Advertisement) and the Prix Sp√©cial de l‚ÄôExpression (Special Prize for Expression). Candide continues to be very popular in the American ski community, finishing in one of the top 3 places in the 2014, 2015 and 2016 editions of the Powder Magazine Readers Poll. Candide has won the Annual Men's Powder Poll four times, three times in a row in 2017, 2018 and 2019 after his win at the inaugural Powder Poll in 2000. (29). In January 2017, Audi invited Candide to direct and produce the sequel to his original quattro video. Entitled quattro2 (25) and also known as \\"Ski The World\\", it is a travel adventure that required 9 months to research and scout appropriate locations. It was filmed over the course of 3 months at over 30 locations in 10 countries where Candide skied on a variety of surfaces, except snow: grass, sand, water, lava, stone, and different types of earth from jungle floor to mountains of gravelly dirt. After 2 months of post- production work the film was released on 22 January 2018. It was viewed over 65 million times in the first 2 weeks across all of Candide and Audi's social media channels. The background story of the video is featured on the Audi website (30). The press coverage of the video from specialized and general sports websites, as well as lifestyle, business and mainstream news outlets was international, with reports in no less than 9 countries including: France (1)(2), Switzerland (3), Germany (4)(5), Spain (6), Greece (7)(8), Ireland (9), Great Britain (10)(11), Canada (12) and the United States (13)(14). France's leading sports media, L‚ÄôEquipe reminded its readers that Candide is \\"the French skiing legend, from who each new video is an event\\" (15), and the country's specialized ski website Skieur said, \\"once again he wins his crazy bet to impress us, to make us forget his last video and to once again push back the limits of what is possible\\" (17). The French language Swiss news website La C√¥te also mentioned Candide, \\"setting the bar in the stratosphere\\" in the title of its article and noted the viral performance of the video reporting that \\"at 8pm, barely two hours after it had been posted online, the video had already been viewed more than 2.2 million times on his Facebook page and more than 2 million times on the specialized platform Zapiks\\". (26) The international trend and pop culture website Konbini called Candide a \\"legend of freeskiing\\" and noted that having no background music \\"just the sound of infernal and interminable sliding\\" made the video \\"a hypnotic visual trip\\" (16). The review on Fstoppers, the website of the online community of photographers and videographers read, \\"Candide Thovex: legend. The French skier‚Äôs latest cinematic marvel was released today, and it‚Äôs the most epic action sports video of all time. Of. All. Time\\".(24) Reviews in the American specialized ski media were also complimentary. The magazine Ski entitled their article ‚Äò\\"Ski the World\\" Redefines Where Skiing is Possible' and wrote, \\"you can‚Äôt deny that Candide is still at the forefront of the ski world\\". (19) Powder magazine started their report by calling Candide \\"The reigning king of viral ski videos\\" and explained that, \\"While having only been online for 72 hours, the video has already garnered nearly a million views on YouTube, which comes as no surprise, as nearly every edit Candide has put out since his first \\"One of Those Days\\" videos in 2014 has instantly gone viral, even outside the ski community. His second OOTD edit currently sits at 22 million views on YouTube\\" before concluding, \\"his newest work confirms yet again why Candide is one of the greatest skiers of our time\\" and called the film \\"five minutes of skiing magic\\". (20) Freeskier magazine said, \\"Candide Thovex is actually an alien\\" (22), and ski and snowboard film production company and media platform Teton Gravity Research called Candide \\"otherworldly\\" and wrote \\"he accomplishes things on two planks beyond the realm of what most would think is humanly possible\\" describing his performance in the video as \\"ski wizardry\\". (23) In March 2018 \\"Ski The World\\" was entered into competition at the fourth edition of the New York City Drone Film Festival where it won the Extreme Sports and Best in Show categories. (28) It was also entered in the UK's ShAFF (Sheffield Adventure Film Festival) where it won three awards: silver in Best Film, silver in Best Adrenaline Film, and bronze in the Best Short Film category.

His father and her kinsman King Frederick William III were fond of the relationship between Wilhelm and Elisa, but some in the Prussian court had discovered historical allegations that her ancestors had bought their princely title from Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor. In the eyes of certain people, she was not deemed of sufficiently high nobility to marry the heir to the Prussian throne (Elisa was not royal, because her father was not a reigning prince).Fleming, pp. 236-37. William's older brother, Frederick William IV of Prussia was married to Elisabeth Ludovika of Bavaria, and Elisabeth was descended from both Bogus≈Çaw Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç and Prince Janusz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç. Thus in 1824, the King of Prussia turned to the childless Emperor Alexander I of Russia to adopt Elisa, but the Russian ruler declined. The second adoption plan by Elisa's uncle, Prince Augustus of Prussia, likewise failed as the responsible committee considered that adoption \\"does not alter the blood\\" (a principle which governs noble and royal connections to the present day). Another factor was the influence of the Mecklenburgish kinsmen of the deceased Queen Louise in the German and Russian courts who were not fond of Elisa's father and opposed the possible marriage.Fleming, pp. 236-37. Eventually, in June 1826, Wilhelm's father was obligated to demand the renunciation of a potential marriage to Elisa. Wilhelm spent the next few months looking for a more suitable bride, but did not relinquish his emotional ties to Elisa. Eventually, Wilhelm asked for the hand of Augusta of Saxe- Weimar, fourteen years his junior, in marriage on 29 August 1826 (in writing and through the intervention of his father). Wilhelm saw his cousin, Elisa, for the last time in 1829. Elisa was later engaged to Prince Friedrich of Schwarzenberg, but the engagement failed. She died, unmarried, in 1834, of tuberculosis while at a spa seeking a cure. Historian Karin Feuerstein-Prasser has pointed out, on the basis of evaluations of the correspondence between both fianc√©es, the different expectations Wilhelm had of both marriages: he wrote to his sister, Czarina Alexandra Feodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia), wife of Czar Nicholas I of Russia, regarding Elisa Radziwill, that \\"One can love only once in life, really\\", but confessed regarding Augusta that \\"the princess is nice and clever, but she leaves me cold.\\" Though Augusta was in love with her future husband and hoped for a happy marriage, theirs was a troubled relationship; Elisa Radziwill was aware of this, and she believed that she herself would have been a better wife to the Prussian prince.

Early career Hubbard-Miles was educated at Lewis School in Pengam. From 1967 onwards, he was a member at various times of Glamorgan County Council, Porthcawl Urban District Council, Mid Glamorgan County Council and Ogwr Borough Council. In the February 1974 general election, he stood unsuccessfully in the Labour stronghold of Aberavon. MP for Bridgend Hubbard-Miles was elected Member of Parliament for the newly created seat of Bridgend in the 1983 Conservative landslide. He was a member of the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs from 1983 to 1985, and was parliamentary private secretary to Nicholas Edwards the Secretary of State for Wales from 1985 to 1987.Parliamentary Private Secretaries (Hansard, 20 December 1985) In July 1983, he introduced a private member's bill for the licensing of caravan and tent sites.CARAVAN AND TENT SITES (Hansard, 20 July 1983) At the 1987 general election, Hubbard-Miles lost the Bridgend seat to Labour Party candidate Win Griffiths. As is traditional, the incoming MP paid tribute to his predecessor in his maiden speech. Win Griffiths said: \\"At the outset of my speech, I pay tribute to my predecessor in the Bridgend constituency, Mr. Peter Hubbard-Miles. He was the first Conservative to represent any constituency in the county of Mid-Glamorgan. Tribute must be paid to him for that signal achievement, which of course I hope will be the last. He showed his independence and fighting spirit during the selection process before the 1983 election, when he successfully took his local Conservative and Unionist Association to court and managed to stop the foisting on the constituency of a person who was rumoured to be a friend of the right hon. Member for Chingford (Mr. Tebbit), the present Conservative party chairman. In 1985, at Westminster, his talents were recognised when the then Secretary of State for Wales, Mr. Nicholas Edwards, who has left this place, appointed him as his parliamentary private secretary. Although he no longer represents the Bridgend constituency, he still has an interest in it. He represents a part of it‚ÄîPorthcawl‚Äîon the council of the county of Mid- Glamorgan. Once again, he had the signal achievement of being the only Conservative on the council‚Äîa solitary role that he manages to play with some success for the people in Porthcawl.\\"Social and Economic Situation (Hansard, 29 June 1987) Later life Peter Hubbard-Miles stood for the Conservatives in the Porthcawl Town Council elections in 2003; and as an Independent candidate for the same council in 2004.

Biography Calder was born in Montreal, Canada, into the Calder family associated with the brewing industry in Alloa, Scotland, and spent his childhood in Kinross, and studied at Bishop's College School in Sherbrooke The Guardian 20 Jul 2002 Page 72 before studying economics in Zurich, Switzerland, in the late 1940s. He was a friend of Samuel Beckett, becoming the main publisher of his prose-texts in Britain after the success of Waiting for Godot on the London stage in 1955‚Äì56. During the 1950s, Calder published the translated work of Anton Chekhov, Leo Tolstoy, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Goethe and Zola, including most of the work of April FitzLyon, and was the first publisher to make William S. Burroughs available in the United Kingdom. From 1963 to 1975, Calder was in partnership with Marion Boyars, and the company was known as Calder and Boyars. The championing of freedom of speech led to Calder's involvement in a number of prosecutions for obscenity, including one in 1966 for publishing Hubert Selby Jr's Last Exit to Brooklyn. While the initial trial resulted in a guilty verdict, the case was won on appeal, and effectively ended literary censorship in Britain. The last novelist to be signed to the company by John Calder personally was Carole Morin whose Penniless in Park Lane he published in 2001. The imprint continues to publish Howard Barker, Tim Waterstone, and other figures of literature both past and present. In 2002, John Calder opened The Calder Bookshop Theatre at 51 The Cut, Waterloo, London.\\\\- The Calder Bookshop Theatre To celebrate his fifty years in publishing, the arts and politics a festschrift was produced. During 2006, Lou MacLoughlan and Louise Milne produced the documentary John Calder: A Life in Publishing commemorating his life. In April 2007, Calder sold his business to independent publishers Alma Books/Oneworld Classics; the imprint retained his name,Rickett, Joel (21 April 2007), \\"The bookseller\\", The Guardian. Retrieved 1 July 2007. while the rights to the non-theatrical work of Beckett were acquired by Faber. Calder was a co-founder of the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh. He was also responsible, along with Sonia Orwell and Jim Haynes, for devising and co-creating an International Writers' Conference held at the Edinburgh International Festival in 1962 and then a Drama Conference with Kenneth Tynan in 1963. These innovative events, intended to draw together writers from all over the world, were arguably a forerunner of the Edinburgh Book Festival, which was not founded for another twenty years. The experience of this first conference was revisited at a Book Festival discussion during the 2012 Edinburgh International Festival.Bartie, Angela and Bell, Eleanor (2012), The International Writers' Conference Revisited: Edinburgh 1962, Cargo Publishing. John Calder also led a hectic life outside publishing. He was a major investor in the Partisan Coffee House, a radical New Left venue in Soho.Bishopsgate Institute Podcast: The Partisan Coffee House: Cultural Politics and the New Left. Mike Berlin, 11 June 2009 In 1970, he stood for election as a Scottish Liberal Party candidate for Kinross and Western Perthshire, finishing 4th. However, he was otherwise mainly known for his interests in the arts in general and his passion for opera in particular. In 1963 he founded and ran for some ten years Ledlanet Nights, a general festival of the arts, held in the hall of his then home, a baronial house at Ledlanet near Milnathort. He published his autobiography, Pursuit: the Uncensored Memoirs of John Calder, in 2001, and various other works related to Beckett. Personal life Calder was married to Christya Myling from 1954 to 1961. They have a daughter named Jamie (b. 1954). Calder and Bettina Jonic were married in 1961. That lasted until 1975, and produced another daughter, Anastasia (b. 1963). Calder married Sheila Colvin, who had been a friend and partner from his earliest involvement with the arts, and the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh. She is a former associate director of the Edinburgh International Festival and director of the Aldeburgh Festival. The couple lived in Edinburgh and Paris.

Despite the similar call letters, KCOS-LP was not related to full-service PBS member station KCOS in El Paso, Texas. History The original construction permit for KCOS-LP was granted on June 26, 1995, to Carlos Ortiz, Sr., pastor of Faith Pleases God Church in Harlingen, Texas. The station was to broadcast on channel 68, but was moved to channel 28 in anticipation of the FCC's requirement to vacate the 700 MHz band. It was licensed as K28FV on January 8, 1998, programming unknown. In January 2000, Hispanic Television Network, Inc. assumed operation of the station and changed the programming to Spanish- language network HTVN, although Carlos Ortiz remained the owner. Later that year, the station took the call letters KCOS-LP. Shortly afterward, Carlos Ortiz died and his widow, Aracelis Ortiz, as executrix of the estate, became the new owner. The station became part of Aracelis Ortiz Corporation in 2001. That same year, KCOS-LP was granted Class A status. By May 2002, the Ortiz family had resumed operation of the station, as Mrs. Ortiz stated in a Petition for Reconsideration of an FCC Notice of Apparent Liability (NAL) that the station was broadcasting programming from La Familia Network (LFN) at the time of the cited violation, which occurred in May 2002.

In July and August 2006, the station had various technical difficulties, prompting them to air a slate in English advising viewers of trouble with the video signal on the station's end. In August 2006, the station once again began airing Fe-TV, but shortly afterward changed to the station ID slate (pictured). The August 2006 update of the website for Fe-TV stated that the network was to be off the air for six months for rebuilding and expansion. The station went silent again in mid-2007, but returned in September 2007, first broadcasting programming from Fe-TV, then switching to LFN. In August 2011, the station voluntarily reverted from Class A to low power status after being challenged by the FCC for failure to file for the fourth quarter in 2008 and all four quarters in 2009 and 2010 the children's television programming reports required of all Class A licensees. On October 7, 2014, the station's license was cancelled by the Federal Communications Commission for failure to file a renewal application. On October 30, 2014, Aracelis Ortiz Corporation re-applied for the license to Federal Communications Commission. On March 15, 2016, The FCC grant the license renewal.

KCOS-LP applied for VHF channel 13, to broadcast from the same location as the analog station. In September, the FCC identified the station as a singleton applicant, meaning that there were no competing applications on the same or adjacent channels, and giving the station until October 31 to file a long-form application.

Members In 1807, when the first collection of \\"M√©moires de Physique et de Chimie de la Soci√©t√© d'Arcueil\\" was published, a list of contributing members read: * Claude Louis Berthollet (1748-1822) * Pierre Simon Laplace (1749-1827) * Friedrich Heinrich Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859) * Louis Jacques Thenard (1777-1857) * Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac (1778-1850) * Jean Baptiste Biot (1774-1862) * Augustin Pyramus de Candolle (1778-1841) * Hyppolyte Victor Collet-Descotils (1773-1815) * Amed√©e Barth√©lemy Berthollet (1780-1810) In the course of the following years they were joined by: * √âtienne-Louis Malus (1775-1812) * Dominique Fran√ßois Jean Arago (1786-1853) * Jacques Etienne B√©rard (1789-1869) * Jean Antoine Chaptal (1756-1832) * Pierre Louis Dulong (1785-1835) * Sim√©on Denis Poisson (1781-1840) Inspiration Trait√© √©l√©mentaire de chimie Antoine Lavoisier had initiated the practice of informal deliberation with his fellow scientists, including his junior assistants, in his laboratory at the Paris Arsenal. : \\"If at any time I have adopted, without acknowledgement the experiments of M.Berthollet, M.Fourcroy, M.de la Place, M.Monge (...) it is owing to (...) the habit of communicating our ideas, our observations and our way of thinking to each other (establishing) between us a sort of community of opinions in which it is often difficult for everyone to know his own.\\" : (Lavoisier in: \\"Trait√© √âl√©mentaire de Chimie\\", 1789) Laplace, and Berthollet with his open laboratory, continued this spirit of fellowship at Arcueil. They were the senior moderators in a scientific debate of novel magnitude; combining the framework of physico-mathematical model (Laplace) with experimental investigation (Berthollet). Roots The roots of the active progress of the Society of Arcueil lay with Napoleon Bonaparte's special attention to sciences in general and - as an artillery officer - to mathematics in particular. Laplace had been Bonaparte's final examiner at the Ecole Militaire (September 1785) where Gaspard Monge, his professor, had encouraged him to finish the two-year course of mathematics in one. Napoleon became acquainted with Berthollet during his campaign in Italy, when Berthollet and Monge were part of the commission sent by the French Directory to select and dispatch Italian art treasures, manuscripts and scientific documents to Paris. Laplace, Berthollet and Monge became instrumental in having Napoleon elected to the First Class of the Institut de France (the class directing the exact sciences) when Lazare Carnot's place fell vacant in 1797. Napoleon in turn invited them to follow him to Egypt (1798-1799) and instructed Berthollet to conduct the recruitment of the scientists that were to compose the \\"Institut d'Egypte\\". The way Berthollet effectively directed the practical installation of the Institute at Qassim Bey's Palace in Ca√Øro, cemented the friendship with Bonaparte in a way that proved its worth in the patronage of the Arcueil Society. When Berthollet, in 1807, concluded that the arrangement for research facilities at Arcueil had cost him more than he could afford, Napoleon, alerted by Laplace and Monge, immediately lend him 150.000 francs to break even. The informality of the \\"Institut d'Egypte\\" found its continuance at Arcueil where Berthollet from his Egyptian-decorated study remained in charge of the publication of the \\"Description de l'Egypte (1809)\\" (ref: Crosland, 1967). Science Under Bonaparte The quantitative applications of the new science of chemistry had important significance for the state economy. The exploitation of beet sugar, for example, was developed with the boycott of English trade in mind. From the publication of Franz Achard's letter on beet sugar in Annales de chimie et de physique (Bruxelles:Van Mons, 1799) and the first presentation of a sample to Napoleon during a session of the First Class of the Institute (June 25, 1800) till the first viable production by Jules Paul Benjamin Delessert in 1812, the subject was one of the scientific priorities in France (see also: Joseph Proust on grape sugar). The industrial fabrication of dye from home grown indigo plant (distinct from woad) at Toulouse was a direct heritage from the \\"Institut d'Egypte.\\" Mathematical instruments were a special favourite with Napoleon, and were often awarded medals at the industrial fairs held at the instigation of Chaptal. Members of the Society of Arcueil were frequently invited to judge on such occasions. In 1806, at the third exhibition in the series, some 1.400 participants attended; up from 220 in 1801. Special attention was given to textile printing adapted by Christophe Oberkampf and his nephew Samuel Widmer with the introduction of roller instead of block printing. This particular industrial process integrated the bleaching by chlorine (eau de javel) invented by Berthollet, as well as the application of new dyeing methods (Samuel Widmers invention of a solid green dye). In 1806 Oberkampf's factory printed fabrics at the rate of 7,5 metres a minute, a viable alternative to English import. Laplace and Monge were also instructed to supervise Robert Fulton's experiments with the Nautilus (1800),subsidized in France. Following Volta's visit to Paris in 1801 important work on the Voltaic pile, involving the Arcueil circle, was carried out under Bonaparte's auspices rewarding Paul Erman, Humphry Davy, Gay-Lussac and Louis Jacques Thenard in the process. The scientific work in general was of first importance to the education at the Ecole Polytechnique, the home base of many Arcueil scientists. The enhancing of the quality of iron and steel, with Collet-Descotils -the precursor in the discovery of iridium- in charge as chief engineer at the \\"Ecole des Mines\\", and above all the development of gunpowder were of prime military significance. The French expertise in explosives was well judged by the Allies when later they dispatched J√∂ns Jacob Berzelius to Paris to update general knowledge. In 1819 he spent two full months as a guest of Berthollet in the laboratory at Arcueil experimenting, but above all sounding Pierre Dulong whose memoir on a new detonating substance (nitrogen trichloride) had appeared in the 1817 volume of \\"M√©moires de Physique et de Chimie de la Soci√©t√© d'Arcueil\\" (Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re had already briefed Humphry Davy on prior stages (1811-1813) of Dulong's invention). \\"Memoires...\\" Titlepage of the volume 1 from 1807 There were three volumes of \\"M√©moires de Physique et de Chimie de la Soci√©t√© d'Arcueil\\": 1807, 1809 and 1817 -the last date testifying to the political difficulties following the demise of Napoleon I of France. The \\"M√©moires...\\" published some important new ideas: Malus on the polarisation of light (1809, 1817); Gay- Lussac on the free expansion of gases (1807); Humboldt and Gay-Lussac on terrestrial magnetism (1807); Gay-Lussac's law of combining volumes of gases (1809); Thenard and Biot's observation on the comparison of aragonite and calcite (one of the earliest proofs of dimorphism)(1809); Gay-Lussac and Thenard on the discovery of the amides of metal (1809); Candolle on heliotropism (1817). Equally important was the special thread, woven into the overall discourse, that held together the brilliant cross-reference among friends. Foreign visitors There had often been attempts to correspond between the French and the English scientists notwithstanding the state of war between their countries. At the first opportunity the English correspondents of Arcueil returned to Paris, among them John Leslie (1814) and Charles Blagden (1814, 1816, 1817) who died of apoplexy (1820) during a visit to Berthollet at Arcueil. Mary Somerville who wrote a popular account of Laplace's \\"M√©canique C√©leste\\" dined at Arcueil with her scientific \\"heroes\\" (1817). J√∂ns Jacob Berzelius had already been invited by Berthollet to come and study at Arcueil in 1810, but it was not till 1818 that the Swedish government judged it appropriate for him to travel to France. At Arcueil Berzelius engaged in a steadfast friendship with Dulong. In 1820 Dulong wrote to Berzelius: : \\"Despite the objections of M.Laplace and some others, I am convinced that this (atomic) theory is the most important concept of the century and in the next twenty years it will bring about an incalculable extension to all parts of the physical sciences\\" It was the testimony of a changing mood and when John Dalton, who had strong differences of opinion with the Society, visited Arcueil in 1822, he received a hearty welcome. It was the last major social event for the Society of Arcueil. Berthollet died on November 6, 1822 and with him went an inspiring power of adherence. Post Scriptum The Society of Arcueil however, through the younger generation, was still to illuminate such work as that of Liebig, Pasteur, Fresnel, Niepce, Daguerre, L√©on Foucault ... as well as many others in the field of scientific education.

It grows up to 10 metres high with a trunk up to 60 cm in diameter, it has smooth, whitish bark and brittle twigs. The dark-green \\"alternate\\" leaves are 5‚Äì15 cm long and 3‚Äì5 cm wide and their edges are finely serrated (although this feature is less pronounced in younger plants).The plants are dioecious and the small flowers are yellowish in colouration, between 3 and 4 mm in diameter and occur in fascicles, growing straight out from naked twigs- these flowers have a strong, pleasant fragrance. The berries are a striking violet colour when ripe and are more or less spherical with a diameter of between 3 and 4 mm. Flowering occurs in late spring ( southern hemisphere )- and on into summer while the berries appear later on in summer and also in autumn. The berries of M. ramiflorus are eaten by a number of native birds, including kerer≈´ and tui, while geckos of the genus Naultinus have also been observed to supplement their primarily insectivorous diet with consumption of these berries. It is also a host species for the caterpillars of the New Zealand endemic moth Austramathes purpurea. It is ubiquitous throughout lower altitude New Zealand forests and is frequently seen in areas of regenerating forest. Subspecies In former analyses, four subspecies of M. ramiflorus were recognised: subsp. ramiflorus of New Zealand, subsp. oblongifolius of Norfolk Island, subsp. fastigiata of Fiji and subsp. samoensis of Samoa and Tonga. More recent studies, especially that by Art Whistler, have indicated that all these subspecies should be regarded as species in their own right.  References  *L. Cockyane and E.

She was murdered in Burundi in December 2000 by the National Forces of Liberation (Palipehutu-FNL or FNL), a Hutu rebel group, along with her Burundian fianc√© and nineteen others travelling from Kigali to Bujumbura. The incident became known as the Titanic Express massacre, named after the bus service on which the victims were travelling. Biography Charlotte grew up in the town of Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire and attended Sheredes, the local comprehensive school. Her father died of leukaemia when she was six years old, leaving her alone with her mother Margot, brother Richard and sister Catherine. She was in a position of some responsibility as the eldest. She went on to Imperial College, London where she studied biochemistry and later gained a PhD in molecular biology. Charlotte lived in Paris for a time, and also made several visits to Africa during her time at university.The volunteer The Guardian 4 January 2001 (Accessed 26 June 2006) In 1999, having recently finished her PhD, during which time she had been a volunteer with St. John Ambulance in Hammersmith, Charlotte made the decision to become a volunteer science teacher with VSO. She was posted to the village of Shyogwe, near Gitarama in southern Rwanda, one of 23 in the second wave of volunteers sent by VSO, who had recently opened a programme to help rebuild the country shattered by the 1994 genocide. Charlotte enjoyed her time in Rwanda and integrated well into the local community, despite having to teach in French and being one of only a handful of white people in the area. In late 2000, Charlotte met and fell in love with Richard Ndereyimana, a Burundian who had been in Rwanda since 1997, first as a Dominican friar and later as a teacher. A few weeks later the couple decided to get engaged. They spent Christmas together with other volunteers by Lake Kivu, then decided to travel to Bujumubura, the Burundian capital to meet with Richard's family, despite the fact that the whole of Burundi, and particularly rural areas, was in a state of civil war and out of bounds to VSO volunteers. Death The couple decided to travel with the now defunct Titanic Express bus service from Kigali to Bujumbura, a journey usually taking around seven hours, to introduce Charlotte to Richard's family.Mellor, John, Agathon Rwasa ‚Äì a strange innocence regained, Indymedia, 7 July 2005 They crossed the border and reached the village of Kilima, only 18 miles from their destination,Briton killed in Burundi massacre BBC News 30 December 2000 (Accessed 26 June 2006) when the bus was ambushed from all sides by armed members of the FNL Hutu extremist group. They demanded money first, and then divided the passengers by ethnicity. The Hutus and most Congolese on the bus were spared but the Tutsis and Charlotte, 21 people in all, were forced to lie face down on the ground and shot one-by-one. Charlotte and Richard were the first to be killed, with the attackers accusing Charlotte of being from the group which supplied the weapons for the Burundi Civil War, a reference to the fact that white people (from Eastern Europe) had supplied the weaponry possessed by most of the combatants, including the guns which were actually used in the killings. Charlotte's body was retrieved from the scene by VSO Rwanda officials and flown back to the UK. Wilson was 27 years old. Aftermath In the weeks following the killings, Charlotte's mother and her younger brother, Richard, made public appeals to the British government to investigate the incident and to treat it as a war crime,Mother calls for massacre inquiry BBC News 3 January 2001 (Accessed 26 June 2006) a move which met with limited success. Richard continued his enquiries personally, however, and via the Human Rights Watch organisation and various contacts he had made in Rwanda and Burundi, he established that the FNL, under the leadership of Albert Sibomana, were responsible for the killing. Richard managed to get hold of a copy of an internal FNL memo detailing the number of victims and bullets used, plus the items stolen. He also found Pierre Nzeyimana, one of the very few survivors of the massacre, who described to him exactly what had happened. The FNL finally admitted responsibility for the massacre in 2005, but by then they, and indeed Sibomana himself, were being given \\"provisional immunity\\" by the Burundi government and the international community as part of a tentative peace process being negotiated in the country. In 2006, Richard wrote a book titled Titanic Express: Finding Answers in the Aftermath of Terror, describing the events leading up to his sister's death and his own efforts in tracking down and attempting to bring her killers to justice. The Charlotte Wilson Memorial Fund Charlotte's family established the Charlotte Wilson Memorial Fund a few weeks after her death to support students in financial difficulty at Shyogwe school, where Charlotte had been teaching. By 4 June 2001, (the day that would have been Charlotte's 28th birthday) the fund had raised more than ¬£10,000, and has since widened its activities to support HIV awareness campaigns in Rwanda and peacebuilding work in Burundi. In Titanic Express, Richard Wilson writes of his pride in the fund's success: \\"We believe, as Charlotte did, that Africa's problems can only be solved by Africans themselves, but that our solidarity can help. A week after the August 2004 Gatumba massacre, a multi-ethnic group of Burundian volunteers from 'Youth Intervention for Peace' took food and clothes to the survivors, paid for in part by the Charlotte Wilson Memorial Fund. It was only a small gesture, but it was something they could do.\\" References Further reading * Richard Wilson (2006) Titanic Express: Finding Answers in the Aftermath of Terror Continuum International Publishing Group ‚Äì Academi External links * The Charlotte Wilson Memorial Fund * Remembering Charlotte Blog * Sunday Times ‚Äì \\"An unforgotten death in Africa\\" Category:Schoolteachers from Hertfordshire Category:Alumni of Imperial College London Category:1973 births Category:2000 deaths Category:British people murdered abroad Category:People murdered in Burundi Category:Deaths by firearm in Burundi ","title":"Charlotte Wilson (VSO)"},{"id":"5691048","text":"Edward Cline,circa 2008.

There are several reasons why a player might opt to strike the ball this way: for example, a right-footed striker advancing towards the goal slightly on the left side rather than having the goal straight in front may feel that his shot power or accuracy with his left foot is inadequate (more colloquially, the player has \\"no left\\"), so will perform a rabona in order to take a better shot. Another scenario could be a right-footed winger sending a cross while playing on the left side of the pitch without having to turn first. Another reason why a player could perform a rabona might be to confuse a defending player, or simply to show off his own ability, as it is considered a skilful trick at any level.  History  Rabona in Spanish means to play hooky, to skip school. The name derives from its first documented performance by Ricardo Infante in a game between Argentinian teams Estudiantes de la Plata and Rosario Central in 1948.\\"El fundador de la rabona\\". Clarin.com The football magazine El Gr√°fico published a front cover showing Infante dressed as a schoolboy with the caption \\"El infante que se hizo la rabona\\" (In English: \\"The infant plays hooky\\"). Another supposed origin for the name is that Rabona is derived from the Spanish word rabo for tail, and that the move resembled the swishing of a cow's tail between or around its legs. In Brazil, the move is also known as the chaleira (kettle) or letra (letter). The first filmed rabona was performed by Brazilian footballer Pel√© in the S√£o Paulo state championship in 1957. Giovanni \\"Coc√≤\\" Roccotelli is credited with popularising the rabona in Italy during the 1970s; at the time, this move was simply called a \\"crossed-kick\\" (incrociata, in Italian).\\"Giovanni Roccotelli\\" \\"Coc√≤, l'acrobata del numero 7\\" In addition to the aforementioned players, some examples of various well known exponents of the rabona, who have successfully performed the skill in competitions and are also known to employ it frequently during matches, are: Alan Ball, Diego Maradona, Rom√°rio, Roberto Baggio, Cristiano Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, Claudio Borghi, Mat√≠as Fern√°ndez, Mat√≠as Urbano, M√°rio Jardel, David Villa, Ariel Ortega, Robinho, Alberto Aquilani, Eden Hazard, Joe Cole, √Ångel Di Mar√≠a, Rivaldo, Ricardo Quaresma, Erik Lamela, Pablo Aimar, Gianfranco Zola, Roberto Carlos, Neymar, Luis Su√°rez, and Jay-Jay Okocha. Other players who have also used this skill successfully during a competitive match are: Andr√©s Vasquez, Djalminha, Fahad Al Enezi, Thomas M√ºller, Manolis Skoufalis, L√©o Lima,\\"Em 2003, Souza faz gol contra o Fluminense ap√≥s cruzamento de letra de L√©o Lima\\" .

Retrieved 20 September 2015 Jordan Henderson, Dimitri Payet, Carlos Bacca, Fabrizio Miccoli, Mario Balotelli, Jonathan Calleri, Diego Perotti, Mikael Lustig, Eran Zahavi, and Robert Lewandowski, among many others; Johnny Giles of Leeds United also performed one in the famous sequence of possession against Southampton in 1972 during the 7‚Äì0 win.  Other sports and uses  The first known use of the rabona in American football was done by Dallas Cowboys placekicker Toni Fritsch, who was a former soccer player that used it late in the fourth quarter of the 1972 NFC Divisional playoffs during an onside kick, that contributed to a historic come from behind 30‚Äì28 victory against the San Francisco 49ers. Rice University placekicker Chris Boswell successfully executed a rabona onside kick against the University of Houston on September 21, 2013, though Rice would lose the game. Boswell had learned the trick from his father, who grew up playing association football in Brazil. On November 6, 2016, Boswell‚Äînow playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers‚Äìhad an unsuccessful attempt against the Baltimore Ravens. In the 2015 Alamo Bowl, Kansas State University placekicker Matthew McCrane successfully executed a rabona kick, though it was recovered by their opponents‚Äîthe UCLA Bruins. The rabona is also a dance step used in the tango. The dance step takes its name from the football kick. In Argentina and Bolivia the term \\"rabona\\" refers to camp followers, women who followed the army, cooking and serving their husbands, fathers and partners who were soldiers, providing nursing services, carrying their arms and munitions, and gathering intelligence which could assist the military.

Field lacrosse was introduced to England in 1876 by William George Beers and other Canadians who toured the country playing exhibition matches. A second tour was arranged in 1883; by then England had 60 clubs playing regular fixtures in Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Lancashire, Middlesex and Yorkshire. The first national governing body for the men's game, the English Lacrosse Union, was formed in 1892. A Ladies' Lacrosse Association followed in 1912. The separate men's and women's organisations merged in 1996 to form the English Lacrosse Association, which was renamed England Lacrosse in 2019. England Lacrosse oversees both the men's and women's national teams. Men's lacrosse Men's club lacrosse in England is divided into parallel northern and southern leagues generally running from late September to Early April. Each league also organises its own knockout competition known as 'Flags', which culminate in their respective 'Flags Finals' at the close of each season. In addition to the regular season, English clubs host a number of internationally popular tournaments, including Bath 8s, Bluesfest, and the Nick Kehoe International. Northern clubs are governed by the North of England Men's Lacrosse Association (NEMLA), which was formed in 1897 when 10 clubs began playing regular fixtures. NEMLA now comprises a Premiership and four further senior divisions. The South of England Men's Lacrosse Association (SEMLA) formed on the 15th of March 1882 and governs clubs across southern England and Wales. As of the 2019/20 season the League consists of the Premier Division, two further senior divisions (Division 1 and Division 2), and three regional feeder divisions. For the 2018/19 season SEMLA created a new Local League to run alongside the main league to boost the number of competitive fixtures while reducing the travel commitment. The winner of the play-off between northern and southern league champions goes forward to compete against other European league champions for the Ken Galluccio Cup in Ghent, Belgium each year. English clubs are the most successful in the tournament to date with eight out of eleven titles. Stockport are the most successful club in the tournament's history with four titles, while Hampstead, Poynton, Spencer, and Wilmslow have each won one title. The main focus of men's lacrosse popularity in England is in Manchester and the North West. Greater Manchester has hosted the World Lacrosse Championship in 1978, 1994, and 2010. A second centre is in the South East, especially in and around London. Men's lacrosse is a common minority sport in universities, which along with club-based youth programs, provide the majority of newcomers with their first experience of the sport. In 2008, a men's BUCS league was introduced, providing greater support and recognition to the men's university teams. The University of Cambridge has the distinction of being the oldest university lacrosse club in the UK having formed in 1882 and have contested the Varsity Match with the University of Oxford every year since 1903, excluding during the world wars. Oxford lead the series 60-39-5. Women's lacrosse McCrone credits lacrosse's limited popularity with Victorian men for its adoption by many girls' public schools in the 1890s. In 1905 former students from Wycombe Abbey, Roedean and Prior's Field schools formed the first women's lacrosse club in England, the Southern Ladies' Lacrosse Club. The club played against sides from public schools and was captained by Audrey Beaton, an Old Roedeanian. In 1912 Beaton led the establishment of the Ladies' Lacrosse Association, which included school teams; Beaton became honorary secretary and Penelope Lawrence, Roedean headmistress, was its first president. The LLA expanded rapidly and established a national team in March 1913. A rivalry with field hockey developed when some girls' schools replaced hockey with lacrosse, but lacrosse remained a more minor sport. A close relationship between the LLA and the men's English Lacrosse Union was consolidated with a merger in 1996 to form the English Lacrosse Association. Today, club women's lacrosse is governed by the South East Women's Lacrosse Association (SEWLA), South West Women's Lacrosse Association (SWWLA), and North Women's Lacrosse Association (NWLA). Youth Lacrosse is often introduced to boys and girls with a soft stick and ball version of the game called pop lacrosse. Since 1982, the English Lacrosse Association has brought over one thousand coaches from outside the U.K. to teach young players the game. International England, Scotland and Wales compete as separate teams in international competitions. In the men's 2006 World Lacrosse Championship England finished in 5th place and in the Women's Lacrosse World Cup in 2005, England finished 3rd. In the men's 2007 World Indoor Lacrosse Championship England finished in 4th place. In the 2008, 2012 and 2016 European Lacrosse Championships England successfully defended their title in the Men's competition, and came second in the Women's competition. The 2010 World Lacrosse Championships were held in Manchester, England from 16‚Äì24 July at the Manchester University Sports Ground, The Armitage Centre. The England team finished the tournament in 5th place.

It was created by Steve Gerber, Gary Martin and Aaron Lopresti. Sludge ran for only twelve issues, with one special: Sludge: Red X-Mas. A second special, Sludge: Swamp of Souls, was planned but never completed.  Character history Frank Hoag was a corrupt NYPD detective who finally grew a spine when he was asked by his mob bosses to kill a fellow dirty cop. When he refuses, his own murder is ordered; he dies by a hail of bullets as well as a bomb. The explosion covers him with chemicals, which combine with the sewage from where the mobsters dump his body. The chemicals had regenerative properties and tried to heal Hoag, but combined the sewer substances with his body, transforming him into a huge mass of living slime. He awakens with a raging anger against criminals and an inability to think and speak coherently, with many words coming out replaced with one that sounds only vaguely similar, such as 'munch' instead of 'mutual'. There exists a connection between the chemicals that transformed Frank Hoag into Sludge and Dr. Gross' research. Dr. Gross conducted the experiments that allowed Kevin Green to transform into Prime. One of Frank's allies is Chas, a blind homeless man who sells newspapers. He does not comprehend that Frank has transformed; he only thinks he has gained an 'underwater voice'. Frank takes a newspaper from Chas, claiming to be good for it and reads about deaths in the sewers. Frank meets Shelley Winters, a sensationalistic reporter, in the sewers. She was investigating the same case that interests Frank and she discovers upon Veffir Voon Iyax, a humanoid, albino alligator-man. Veffir had killed the two people and many more. During the fight, Veffir claims he is from another world, and that nobody who meets him lives. Despite this, Sludge kills him in battle and demands 35 cents from Winters. He uses this to pay back Chas. Lord Pumpkin's first appearance was in Sludge's series as a recurrent foe. Rune debuted in a backup feature of Sludge #1 (but he does not meet or interact with Sludge in it). Powers and abilities Sludge has a tremendous regenerative ability, healing most wounds in seconds, and able to regrow large areas of body tissue. Submersion in water speeds up this ability. He does not require air and is immune to most chemical toxins. His touch melts human flesh.

In classical guitar, the right hand is developed in such a way that it can sustain two, three, and four voice harmonies while also paying special attention to tone production. The index (i), middle (m), and ring (a) fingers are generally used to play the melody, while the thumb (p) accompanies in the bass register adding harmony, and produces a comparable texture and effect to that of the piano. The classical guitar is a solo polyphonic instrument, and it is difficult to master. Classical guitar technique can be organized broadly into subsections for the right hand, the left hand, and miscellaneous techniques. In guitar, performance elements such as musical dynamics (loudness or softness) and tonal/timbral variation are mostly determined by the hand that physically produces the sound. In other words, the hand that plucks the strings defines the musical expression. Historically, this role has been assigned to the dominant hand which, for the majority of players, is the right hand. Similar reasoning is behind string players using the right hand for controlling the bow. In the following article the role of the hands should be reversed when considering left-handed players. An introductory overview of classical guitar technique is given in the article Classical guitar (Section: Performance). Posture A guitarist demonstrating traditional classical guitar posture The \\"classical\\" guitar is the traditional guitar of Spain. It is built so that the right hand falls at the back of the sound hole when it is placed on the left leg. The player sits on the front of the chair and the left foot is supported by a foot stool or some other device. The right elbow is placed on the box of the guitar so that the hand falls over the strings, with the fingers at an angle to the strings. The right foot tucks underneath the player to make room for the guitar. And the guitar is turned to the player's right so as to rest against the ribs on the player's right side. Care must be taken to keep the guitar turned to the right. There is a tendency for the guitar to slide down the left leg, collapsing the left shoulder and distorting the right wrist (called \\"deviated wrist\\"). Properly held, the fingers play at an angle to the string, not perpendicular. Keeping the guitar turned out to the right is important because, when the guitar slides down the left leg and the left shoulder collapses, the thumb and fingers of the right hand hit each other. In order to play freely, the fingers and thumb must be able to follow-through without hitting each other. When the guitar remains turned to the right, the fingers are at an angle to the strings and the thumb plays without interfering with the fingers. Basic considerations in determining a chosen playing position include: *the physical stability of the instrument *ensuring the freedom of both hands such that they have free access to the instrument and can meet all technical demands without having to be occupied with supporting the instrument or keeping the instrument upright *elimination of general muscular tension and physical stress in the assumed body position. Playing techniques Over the history of the guitar, there have been many schools of technique, often associated with the current popular virtuoso of the time. For example, Mauro Giuliani (1781-1829) is associated with arpeggio playing and his compositions are largely based on their use. Giuliani's solution to achieving independence between the fingers (evening out constraints or differences between the fingers) in the right hand was playing his 120 Right Hand Studies. By contrast, Andres Segovia maintained that playing scales two hours a day \\"will correct faulty hand position\\" (1953) and for many years, this was the accepted practice. In both schools‚Äîone being all free-stroke (Giuliani arpeggio practice) and the other rest-stroke (Segovia scale practice) -- the basis for learning the technique is hours of repetition. In 1983, Richard Provost published his first edition of Classic Guitar Technique , outlining principles of scale and arpeggio technique based on his study of anatomy to make the 'inherent kinesthetic tendencies' (\\"our limitations\\") of the human body work for the player. Rather than working around them, the intention being production of \\"a musical, articulated sound within our physical limitations\\". A second revised edition of Provost's work (detailing further the author's theory), was published in 1992. The basis of this technique is referred to by Charles Duncan in his book The Art of Classical Guitar Playing as \\"the awareness of the release of tension\\". Fingering notation The traditional names of the right hand fingers are pulgar, √≠ndice, medio, and anular, derived from Spanish. They are generally called p, i, m, and a, \\"p\\" being the thumb and \\"a\\" being the ring finger. (c = little finger or \\"chiquito\\"). The four fingers of the left hand (which stop the strings) are designated 1 = index, 2 = middle, 3 = ring finger, 4 = little finger The number 0 designates an open string, one not stopped by a finger of the left hand. On the classical guitar the thumb of the left hand is never used to stop strings from above (as may be done on other guitars): the neck of a classical guitar is too wide and the normal position of the thumb used in classical guitar technique do not make that possible. Scores (in contrast with tablature) do not systematically indicate which string is to be plucked (although in most cases the choice is obvious). When indication of the string is required, the strings are designated 1 to 6 (1 for the high E, to 6 the low E) with the string number inside a circle. The fret/position where the first finger of the left hand is placed on the fingerboard is usually not systematically indicated, but when necessary (mostly in the case of the execution of barr√©s) indicated with Roman numerals corresponding to the fret number from the string nut (which has no numeral) towards the bridge. Right hand technique Placing the right hand on the strings If you look at the fingers, you will notice that the index finger is shorter than the middle finger. If you place a pencil across the fingertips, you will see a diagonal line. This line is \\"the angle of the fingers to the string\\". As noted above in the section about holding the guitar, the fingers fall at an angle to the strings and this line, across the tips of the index and middle fingers is the angle at which they touch the strings (a finger stays behind). To find the hand position on the strings, drape the wrist, swing the arm to the strings and touch the i finger to the strings. Then roll the arm on the guitar until the m finger touches the strings (just those two fingers, i & m, not the ring finger, that comes later), and this is \\"the angle of the fingers to the string\\". In this way, the shape of the i & m fingers is the same, they do not reach or hook. The fingers are on the diagonal, not square to the string, the thumb is out front. The height of the wrist off the guitar is roughly equal to the width of the back hand. The finger on the string Release the fingers and swing the i finger to the string. The finger swings on a hinge (the first knuckle) and goes to the string. The finger lands directly on the nail and flesh at the same time. By landing on the nail, a \\"ticking\\" sound is avoided. Further, the nail lands on the side of the nail, not flat on the nail, but at an angle to the string. The nail then crosses the string in exactly one point on the string and on the nail, avoiding the sound of \\"wiping\\" the string with the nail. Once the finger is on the string, landing on the nail, the finger pushes (not pulls), the tip joint releases, and a clean 'snap' occurs, without ticking or wiping sounds. The two primary plucking techniques are: * Rest- stroke (apoyando), in which the finger that plucks the string lands on the next string; and * Free-stroke (tirando), in which the finger does not land on the string behind, but, rather, continues until the energy of the stroke is dissipated. Rest stroke is useful for single-line melody playing. Free-stroke is mainly used in arpeggio (\\"broken-chord\\") playing. They are often combined to provide contrasting voices, between melody and harmony. \\"Rest-stroke on the melody\\" is a common approach to balancing the voices. An important factor for the quality of sound is the angle of the finger as the string is plucked. This is usually not at a right angle to strings, but usually where the outstretched fingers would point slightly to the left. This is considered both beneficial to tone and creating less noise due to nail contact, since the string can glide over the rounded nail, rather than being hooked or caught by it. Holding the fingers and hand perpendicular to the strings may cause other difficulties. Since the string is aligned with the groove between fingertip and nail: this may cause clicking noises or double sounds (fingertip sound, then nail sound). By holding the fingers and hand to the left, it is impossible for the string to land in the groove, since the left side of the nail will touch the string first. One of the tenets of right hand technique in melody playing is strict alternation of i & m. That is, no right hand finger should be used twice in a row (excluding the thumb). The a finger is occasionally used if i-m alternation creates an awkward string-crossing in the right hand. Otherwise, the default is strict alternation of i & m. Where the a finger is used, i-a or a-m fingering is preferred to m-a, due to the physical constraints of the hand. *Scale playing: Usually an alteration of the index and middle finger; however other alterations using the annular finger (or even an alterations with the thumb) are common as well Factors that influence the choice might be the speed of the scale and the progression of the melody over more than one string, i.e., a scale usually starts on one string and continues on another. However, during slower movements (especially of contrapuntal music) guitarists might not alternate the fingers strictly if this facilitates the interpretation by preserving tonal similarity. An example of this might be when the index finger (or the thumb) is used to play one melody line on the 3rd string while the annular finger might be used for a melody on the first string. A melody line can move over various strings so a flexible approach is needed, experimentation and development of patterns that suit individual preference. It is important to note that not only the fingers are involved in the plucking of the string, but the hand should also be held comfortably loose and may move slightly as well - even the arm is involved. For example, when playing scales (usually with alternating fingers, e.g., index, middle, index, middle, ...) and moving from the top strings down, or the bottom strings up, the hand moves up and down as well in order to adjust the placement of the fingers to be at an optimum. =Tirando versus Apoyando= Tirando (also known as free-stroke) is where the plucking motion is made in such a manner that, after plucking, the finger stays in the air - it does therefore not land on an adjacent string. Apoyando (also known as the rest-stroke) is a plucking motion made in such a manner that after the desired string has been plucked, the fingertip rests on the next adjacent string. Historically (for baroque guitars, right up to classical or romantic repertoire of Sor and Mertz) the free-stroke was used. One of the first classical guitarists to use the rest- stroke was the Spaniard Julian Arcas (1832‚Äì1882)Handbook of Guitar and Lute Composers by Hannu Annala, Heiki M√§tlik (and it may have been used by Jose Ciebra as wellAn Early Sighting of the Use of Rest-stroke Technique in Northern Europe by Randy Osborne), though it was already in use for flamenco music. The rest-stroke was regarded as a fundamental way of plucking the string during much of the 20th century. Today certain professional classical guitarists prefer the free stroke. Roberto Aussel (Professor of Classical guitar at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Tanz K√∂lnHochschule f√ºr Musik und Tanz K√∂ln ) has said: *\\"Particularly, apoyando as a main principle, is today hardly used anymore.\\"Akustik Gitarre Feb 2010 *\\"Speziell Apoyando als Grundprinzip findet sich heute kaum noch.\\" Aussel also notes that this preference of using primarily a free-stroke, was already common in Argentina in the 1950s, and in other South American countries. His teacher, Jorge Mart√≠nez Z√°rate, abandoned the rest-stroke completely and used only free-stroke, achieving an exceptional tone with it. Abel Carlevaro was also a strong proponent of the free-stroke. Carlevaro and Z√°rate advocated an \\"effective use of musclegroups and with it an equilibrium of energy and relaxation\\". Manuel Barrueco has said that he used almost exclusively free-stroke in baroque music: *\\"[...] In baroque music I use probably at least 95% to 99% free strokes, as I feel it is more stylistically correct and it is the best way to fully control dynamics and tone in polyphonic music.\\" The choice of stroke that a guitarist will use is motivated by personal choice of tone quality, dynamic control and efficiency. The tendency of modern influential classical guitar performers and teachers to promote it often leads to a preference for free-stroke, and thus a discrepancy from earlier trends such as the mid-20th century reliance on rest-stroke. Furthermore, by experimenting with hand positions and nail angles, it is possible to achieve satisfactory volume with the free-stroke which is comparable to that of the rest-stroke: this often requires the use of a smoothly filed fingernail. Again, this is a matter of preference and taste for the individual guitarist. Preparation \\"Preparation\\" is the placing of the finger on the string such that the flesh ‚Äî as well as part of the nail ‚Äî touches the string, before a plucking motion is made, producing an articulated sound, found in other instruments. Before plucking, usually both the left side of the nail and the finger touch the string; this enables the finger (and hand) to rest on the string in a balanced way. When the plucking motion is made, only the nail-contact remains: The curvature of the nail (starting from its left side) allows the string to be pulled back while the string slides towards the tip of the nail, where it is released in a single motion, called \\"the gesture\\". If the nail allowed to \\"wipe\\" the string rather than crossing in one spot, a grating noise or a very unarticulated sound of the nail traveling along the string is produced, which has a very distasteful sound and should be avoided (unless, of course, this tone or effect is desired). For practice purposes, the use of preparation can be used to accentuate a staccato note: Here the finger is placed on the vibrating string to stop its sound, and only after a delay this finger plucks the string. Finger alterations that are commonly used are: i, m, i, m; \\"p, m, p, m\\" and \\"i, a, i, a\\" for faster progressions. The last two are used because they eliminate the friction of the two neighboring fingers' passing in fast progressions (as i and m tend to rub together in unpracticed musicians). =Tremolo= Tremolo is the rapid reiteration of a string: plucking of the same string, although not necessarily on the same note many times, quickly and next to each other (although usually separated by a melody in the thumb). In this instance, while there will still be \\"preparation,\\" per se, it will not be evident and will definitely be lacking if the speed has not been gradually increased. Finger alterations that are commonly used are: *\\"p, m, i\\" for slower, three note tremolos, with the thumb picking out the melody *\\"p, a, i\\" for faster three note tremolos, with the melody in the thumb *\\"p, a, m, i\\" for a four note tremolo, with the melody in the thumb *\\"p, i, a, m, i\\" or \\"p, m, a, m, i\\" for a five note tremolo, although almost exclusively used in flamenco. \\"p, c, a, m, i\\" is rarely used, if ever, as the pinky is not a very popular finger to be used. =Arpeggiation= Arpeggiation is similar to the tremolo technique, except almost always the fingers pluck separate strings. Usually, the pattern of finger pluckings is such that it begins with the fingers resting on the strings as follows - thumb (p) on a bass-string and index (i), middle (m), third finger (a) each on one of the three treble strings respectively. Finger alterations that are commonly used are: *\\"p, a, m, i\\" *\\"p, i, m, a\\" *\\"p, a, m, i, m, a\\" *\\"p, i, m, a, m, i\\" The last two patterns are interesting, however, as if they are to be played quickly, the last m and an or i must be played with slightly less preparation, as it would be extraordinarily difficult to move the fingers to their correct strings for the second note and still have time for a normal preparation. Note: It is important to realize that as the right hand progressions become faster, rest strokes become very impractical, and can wreak havoc upon one's technique. Free strokes are always best for the index, middle, and third fingers, when playing fast arpeggios or sections of tremolo. Analysis A guitarist will individually choose how much preparation to use for each stroke, depending on personal choice and the effect that is to be produced. Most guitarists make this choice intuitively, and will vary and adjust strokes while playing. Varying viewpoints Note: The following discussion presents points that may differ from guitarist to guitarist. In any case the angle of the right hand's fingers (when outstretched) to the strings is not varied greatly. =Angle of attack= *Slow: More parallel angle (right-hand fingers more to the left) The hand is usually held at such an angle, that the outstretched fingers point slightly to the left (rather than perpendicular) to the strings. But this angle can be actively varied (albeit only slightly) and results in different tones, but also has some consequences: The more the fingers point to the left of the strings (the more parallel they are to the strings), the longer the fingernail is in contact with the strings, since the string glides over more of the fingernail: This angle requires preparation - placing the nail (and finger) on the string, and then following through in a controlled manner. This angle creates a warmer tone, but because the string glides over more of the nail, this is not good for fast repetitive plucking. *Fast: More perpendicular angle (right-hand fingers) For fast repetitive picado, the vibrating string is immediately plucked again with the nail: an impulse is shot into the string so that it maintains its motion - there is no time for \\"preparation\\". At high speeds it is not easily possible to produce a strong clear tone, if the fingers are angled too far to the left, since there is no time for \\"preparation\\": \\"preparation\\" is the placing of the left side of the nail (and often also finger) on the string. The faster the plucking, the more a gliding over the nail (more parallel) delays the sound. Thus for fast plucking the guitarist may choose to hold the right-hand fingers at a more perpendicular angle to the strings (though the fingers might still point slightly to the left) and strike them more with the tip of the nail. The above discussion was mainly focused on the angle as a dependency on the speed of plucking. Even more important is the dependency of the angle on the tone. As usual there is always some sort of trade-off involved and the ultimate details depend on each individual guitarist separately, as well as the players fingers/nails. *Consequences on practicing speed build-up When practicing at slow speeds, the hand position and stroke used should ideally be the same as the one for the fast tempo. Usually the hand might be in different positions for fast and slow playing. More importantly a different stroke may be intuitively used for slower playing (i.e. stroke with preparation) than for faster playing (stroke without preparation). This means that when building up accuracy and evenness by practicing pluckings (such as tremolo) at slow speeds, the hand position and stroke used during this slow practice should be identical to the hand position and stroke that will be used when the pluckings are performed up to speed. This means that slow tremolo practice (for example) requires the practicing of \\"stroke without preparation\\"! This may be difficult since most guitarists intuitively choose a stroke with (at least) a bit of preparation during slower playing. However, in this respect, the practice-method of playing with short speed bursts in-between slow practice, can prove useful, by reminding the guitarist of the correct hand position and stroke (without preparation). On the other hand, tremolo (etc.) should not be exclusively practiced with \\"speed-stroke\\", but also at slower speeds with a normal \\"stroke with preparation\\": to assist the guitarist in improving an intrinsic feeling for the location of the strings. =Right hand wrist/hand position= There is a lot of freedom in the positioning of the right hand, which affects the angle at which the fingers will attack the string. Guitarists spend a lot of time finding their own individual positions (as there can be more than one) that allow the fingers/nails to pluck the strings with *a quality of tone (possibly variations of tone with different positions) *a minimum of tension in fingers, wrist, or forearm *a healthy position (without strain) Hand position is also influenced by the arm: *changing where the right arm rests on the guitar (either more to the left or more to the right): **This can be very helpful when changing timbre from near the bridge to closer to the fretboard *changing what part of the right arm rests on the guitar (either) The hand can be varied in the following ways: *the height (bending) of the wrist, although (note that the more the wrist is bent, the more strain is placed upon it. This can informally lead to wrist injuries) **bending of hand to the left or right from the wrist (this is usually considered a strain, and today many guitarist hold the hand almost straight compared to the arm) *the rotation of the hand (it can be rolled to the left or to the right. Often guitarist might occasionally roll the hand slightly to the right - opening up the hand and changing the angle of plucking; whilst others might generally use an open position with the hand rolled slightly to the left) =Nails= Modern practice generally makes use of the nails of the right hand in combination with the flesh of the fingertips in order to pluck the strings. During the 19th century many influential guitarists such as Fernando Sor, Francisco T√°rrega and his pupil Emilio Pujol played using the flesh of the fingertip, in common with lute technique. This was more easily done with gut strings due to the surface texture, but became more difficult with the introduction of nylon strings where the surface was smooth. Plucking the strings usually involves making contact first with the fleshy part of the fingertip, the tip of the nail and then letting the string glide smoothly along the curvature of the fingernail until the string is released at the fingernail's tip. Generally the tip of the nail should be shaped so that it doesn't 'hook' on the string, but provides a reinforcing tone and clarity of articulation to the flesh. As the majority of modern players follow the practices of angling the stroke of the finger - it may be considered that the left tip of the nail (viewed from above palm down) can be shaped and tapered to facilitate the release of the string after plucking. This involves filing the nail so that it presents a profile where the curve of the tip almost joins the finger smoothly on the left, and increases away from the finger to the right. For those players following the technique of using the right side of the finger (an approach popularized by the guitarists Ida Presti and Alexander Lagoya) - the opposite would apply. The actual shape is subject to such individual biology and musical preference that only experience and guidance of other musicians will be seen to be the best form chosen by the student. =Strumming= * Rasgueado See main article Rasgueado. Rasgueado or rasgueo is a Spanish term for different forms of strumming the strings on the flamenco and classical guitar that include the use of the back of the fingernails. More commonly, the term refers to using the backs of the nail in sequence to give the impression of a very rapid strum. There are several types of rasgueado that employ differing combinations of fingers and thumb allowing for a variety of rhythmical accentuations and subdivisions of the beat. * Use the palm-side of the thumb joint to lightly strum strings, producing a soft, low sound. * Use the thumb nail to produce a bright sound. * Use the thumb nail to strum from lowest string to highest, followed by a stroke by the thumb nail from highest string to lowest, and finally by the middle finger coming from highest string to lowest. This pattern is most commonly used in the form of triplets for a 4/4 measure, or used four times in a 12/8 measure. * A simple combination of both fingers and thumb, the thumb striking the lowest strings and fingers picking the upper notes of the chord from lowest to highest strings in rapid succession. Left hand technique While the right hand is responsible for the sound of the guitar, the left hand performs two functions: pressing on the strings (to shorten their effective length and change the pitch) and articulation, i.e. slurring (commonly known as 'hammer-ons' and 'pull-offs') and vibrato. In musical notation, the left hand fingers are referred to as 1, 2, 3, and 4 (starting with index). The basic position for the left hand is much the same as that of the right, except upside down. Unlike many players of steel-string and electric guitars, which have a narrower neck and fingerboard, classical guitarists do not place their left hand thumbs over the top of the neck. Instead, they place them behind the neck, usually behind the second finger. The thumb then rolls back so that the thumb plays 'off the bone'. The bone of the thumb 'hangs' off a shoulder that is carved into the back of the neck of the guitar and, eventually, a hard, dry callus forms on the thumb, allowing the left hand to shift without sticking to the guitar. By keeping the thumb behind the second finger and playing off the front of the third finger, the classical guitarist sets the left hand shape. Playing with the left hand more or less parallel to the neck requires a certain amount of stretching between the fingers. There is a tendency, especially when one first begins guitar, to collapse the first and second fingers together to press on the string. For example, in playing the F on the first string, first fret (often the second note ever fingered after open E, first-string) there is a tendency to put the second finger on top of the first to hold the note. Holding a note with two fingers, 1 & 2, however, puts the reach between the fingers between the second and third, the hardest reach. The easiest reach is actually between the third and fourth (pinky) fingers. The next easiest between the first and second and the hardest between the middle fingers, between 2 & 3\\\\. Therefore, in order to put all the fingers on the strings (one finger per fret), the reach would best go between 1 & 2 and 3 & 4\\\\. Care should be taken to unlock 1 & 2\\\\. One way to train the hand to unlock 1 & 2 is to place a pencil between 1 & 2 with the other end behind the thumb while playing. Classical guitarists have a different set of left hand calluses on their fingertips than the steel-string players. In the steel-string, played with the guitar under the arm and on the right hip (called 'playing off the hip'), the left hand fingers of the steel string guitarist play on the diagonal, or 'for the reach', and the fingertip lands on the pad of the finger, forming a callus on the pad. The classical guitarist has a different set of left hand calluses as the hand of the classical player falls more parallel to the neck and plays on the \\"front\\" (nail side) of the fingertip. As a general rule, in classical, if the player concentrates on playing on the front of the third (or ring) finger, the other fingers will follow. To play a note clearly, the fingertips of the left hand should be pressed against the string just behind the appropriate fret. Allowing the left shoulder to relax lets the highest finger in the chord or scale slide against and rest on the fret, giving the best sound‚Äîand the easiest reach with other fingers. The fingers are, thereby, placed closest to the frets. Often the index finger is required to play more than one string, called the \\"barre\\" technique. The guitarist places the index finger across some or all of the strings at a particular fret and uses the remaining three fingers to play other notes. Rather putting down the barre first, it is often easier to place the fingers and add the barre last, according to which notes are needed first. When playing notes above the twelfth fret, called \\"on the body\\", the left shoulder is dropped and the thumb stays behind, on the neck (as opposed to cello technique where the thumb can be placed on top of the fingerboard to assist in stopping the string). It is possible to play the same note on different strings, called \\"registration\\" or \\"registering\\". For example, the note \\"e\\", first string open, may be played, or \\"registered\\" on any string. The guitarist often has choices of where to 'register' notes on the guitar based on: * Ease of fingering. Beginners learn the open, first position before anything else and might be more comfortable registering notes on open strings in the first position. Advanced players might find solutions in higher positions based on musical expression or using a shift on a string as a guide. * Playing \\"on the string\\"‚ÄîKeeping a melody or musical line on one string for continuity of tone or expression. * The advent of nylon strings. Historically, the early guitar (pre-WW II) was strung with catgut rather than the nylon to which we have become accustomed. Earlier editions often kept the melody on the second string, which was considered to have a warm full romantic sound in the higher positions that was appropriate to the style of the times. The first string has a thinner diameter, (which tends to emphasize higher harmonic frequencies) and the difficulty of manufacturing affordable strings in suitable quality raised issues of poor intonation. With the advent of nylon strings and refinements in string manufacture, position-playing (playing in a block-style) became more technically feasible as problems with intonation and tone quality were addressed. The introduction of alternative materials to nylon in the manufacture of strings and innovations in modern guitar design continue to bring this issue into focus. * For reasons of counterpoint: allowing a voice on one string to vibrate for its duration while playing a moving voice on another string. =Slurs= Slurs, trills and other ornaments are often played entirely with the left hand. For example; in a simple case of an ascending semitone slur (Hammer-on), a note stopped by the first finger of the left hand at the fifth fret is first played in normal manner, then, without the right hand doing anything further, the second finger of the left- hand is placed straight down at the sixth fret on the same string, using its momentum to raise the tone of the still-ringing string by a semitone. A descending slur (Pull-off) is simply the opposite of the above, the slur begins on the higher note and it is common that the finger pressing the higher note actively plucks the string as it lifts, causing the string to vibrate from the fret that the lower finger is depressing. The lower finger is usually in position and pressing before the procedure begins. Three specific descending slurs exist, (1) the active finger lifts directly up and off the string, (2) the active finger rests against the adjacent string immediately after, and (3) a hybrid of these two in which the finger bumps the adjacent string before lifting off. If these procedures are repeated a few times the result is known as a trill. Because the note is being plucked repeatedly it is possible to continue a trill indefinitely. Occasionally, the upper note in such a trill is played by alternating fingers thus: 2-1-3-1-, etc. =Vibrato= The classical guitar vibrato is executed by rocking the tip of the left-hand finger(s) back and forth horizontally within the same fret space (i.e. along the string axis, and not across it as for a vertical \\"bend\\" in rock or blues music) producing a subtle variation in pitch, both sharper and flatter than the starting note, without noticeably altering the fundamental tonal focus of the note being played. The speed of the vibrato often has a great effect on the way the note is perceived, with faster vibratos commonly adding tension and stress, while slower vibratos produce a more lyrical sound. The slowest of vibratos can be used to imitate a bowed instrument \\"growing\\" a note after its initial inception. Even though this effect refers to volume in bowed instruments, having a pitch variation that follows the same structure of the volume variation in many situations can have the same effect for the listeners. When vibrato is required at the first or second fret it is sometimes beneficial to push the string across its axis as it produces a more noticeable vibrato sound there. This second method will only vary the pitch by raising it sharper than the starting note, but is the most common method of vibrato used by steel-string and electric guitar players, lacking the precise tonal qualities of nylon strings. =Harmonics= Natural harmonics can be played by touching a left hand finger upon specific points along an open string without pressing it down, then playing the note with the right hand. The positions of both the left and right hand are important. The left hand must be placed at a nodal point along the string. Nodal points are found at integral divisions of the string length. The simplest example would be when the left hand finger divides the string in two and is placed at the twelfth fret. The note then played is one octave higher than the open string. If the string is divided in three (left hand finger near the seventh fret) the note played is one octave and one fifth above the open string. The player must be careful not to pluck the string at another node (nearer the bridge) otherwise the harmonic will not sound. This can be easily demonstrated by resting a left hand finger on the fifth fret and trying to play the note by plucking the string at the twelfth fret with the right hand - no note will be produced. Ideally the right hand should pluck the string at an antinode. Artificial harmonics are played by stopping the string as usual with the left hand then resting (not pressing) the index finger of the right hand on the string at a nodal position (commonly 5, 7, 9, or 12 frets above the left hand finger) and plucking the string with the ring finger or thumb of the right hand. = Left- hand position = In the left hand, each finger is responsible for exactly one fret. For each hand-position of four frets, the left hand is stationary while its fingers move. Consequently, three hand-positions (of frets 1-4, 5-8, and 9-12) cover the 12-fret octave of each string. In common with other classical stringed instruments, classical guitar playing and notation use formal positions of the left hand. The 'nth position' means that the hand is positioned with the first finger over the nth fret. Studies There are many exercises that can be used to develop right and left hand technique on the classical guitar. *Leo Brouwer **Etudes Simples - Volumes 1-4 *Matteo Carcassi **25 Etudes Opus 60 *Mauro Giuliani **Etudes Instructives Faciles Et Agreables, Opus 100 **Xviii Lecons Progressives, Opus 51 (18 Progressive Lessons) **Studio Per La Chitarra, Opus 1 (The Study Of The Guitar) **Studi Dilettevoli, Opus 98 (Entertaining Studies) **Esercizio Per La Chitarra, Opus 48 (Training for the Guitar) 24 Studies **Primi Lezioni Progressive, Opus 139 (First Progressive Lessons) **120 Studies for Right Hand Development *Fernando Sor **12 Studies, Opus 6 **Douze Etudes, Opus 29 **Vingt Quatre Le√ßons, Opus 31 **Vingt Quatre Exercises, Opus 35 **Introduction a l' Etude de la Guitare, Opus 60 **20 Studies for Guitar, (a compilation by Andr√©s Segovia) *Heitor Villa-Lobos **Douze Etudes (1929) See also *Classical guitar pedagogy Notes References * External links *Complete method for the guitar by Otto Feder published by Ditson, 1858 *The Humane Guitarist Site dedicated to the technique and health of the classical guitarist. *Musicians and Injuries *Brad Conroy's Lesson on Right Hand Arpeggios *Building Blocks of Classical Guitar Technique *CREATIVE GUITAR - Classical Guitar resource website and blog. *Left-Hand Trouble Shooting by Peter Kun Frary, Professor of Music ‚Ä¢ University of Hawaii, Leeward. *The Classical Guitar Express Free newsletter on practicing Classical Guitar by Tom Prisloe *\\"Rest Stroke and Free Stroke Revisited\\" by Ricardo Iznaola, in PDF or HTML *How to play Classical Guitar Advices by Guitarists for Guitarists Category:Guitar performance techniques Category:Spanish classical guitar ","title":"Classical guitar technique"},{"id":"5691157","text":"Roger Gareth Thomas (14 November 1925 ‚Äì 1 September 1994) was a British Labour Party politician and Member of Parliament. Biography He was born at Garnant, Carmarthenshire, on 14 November 1925, the son of Evan J. Thomas, a coalminer who later became a baker, and Beryl Thomas. The family was Welsh- speaking and left-wing. Thomas inherited a fierce anti-Conservative standpoint which remained with him throughout his life. He received his education at Amman Valley Grammar School in Ammanford, and the London Hospital Medical School. He qualified as a medical practitioner in 1948 just as the National Health Service was beginning. He served as a captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps (national service), 1949‚Äì52, a period during which he saw service in west Africa. He returned to south Wales to practise as a family doctor in the Cross Hands area between Port Talbot and Carmarthen in 1952, serving the local community there for more than forty years. He joined the Labour Party in 1970, securing election as the Labour member for the Saron ward on the Dyfed County Council where he served from 1977 until 1979. In 1979, Thomas was elected Member of Parliament for Carmarthen, defeating the President of Plaid Cymru, Gwynfor Evans. It was one of only two Labour gains throughout the whole of Great Britain in that general election which saw Margaret Thatcher and the Conservatives sweep to power at Westminster. He continued to represent the constituency until his resignation in 1987, having successfully fought off a powerful challenge from the Conservatives in the person of Nigel Thomas in the June 1983 general election. A member of the Fabian Society, he was appointed a member of the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs in 1979 and he was also opposition spokesman on Welsh Affairs. He was one of the few Labour MPs to represent a predominantly rural area and concentrated on agriculture and EEC issues. Although mildly supportive of devolution, Thomas was opposed to what he regarded as the excesses of Welsh nationalism. On 30 January 1984 Thomas was convicted at Gowerton Magistrates' Court, Swansea, of importuning for immoral purposes at a men's public lavatory (he was fined ¬£75). The case was reported and attracted negative publicity for Thomas, who announced to Carmarthen Constituency Labour Party on 2 March that he would resign his seat. However, he delayed his resignation to allow for a successor to be selected. In the meantime, Thomas continued his Parliamentary activity and became one of the most active Welsh MPs of all. He also received a good deal of sympathy on his plight, and times had moved on since William Field was forced to resign in similar circumstances thirty years before. A similar scandal involving a Conservative MP also deflected some attention. He was also pressed to stay on by the Labour whips who feared a byelection in a marginal seat may be lost. By the end of July, Thomas had started to have doubts about resigning, to the chagrin of his constituency, and on 17 August he announced he would remain until the dissolution of Parliament. In an acrimonious selection of a new Labour Candidate for the constituency in 1985, Thomas' preferred choice was a London-based trade union official and London Borough of Bromley Councillor, Ira Walters. Walters, a Gorseinon-born Welsh Speaker was, at age 23, the youngest candidate in the 1983 general election, contesting the Conwy Constituency. In the 1985 selection, he acquired the majority of branch nominations in the Constituency, largely from the eastern, industrialised areas of the Constituency. His was a controversial nomination given that he was a Political Assistant to Eric Hammond, General Secretary of the Electricians' Trade Union, the EETPU, at a time when that trade union was at odds with the majority of trade union views on the major industrial disputes at that time involving Fleet Street/Wapping and the Miners' strike. Walters, however, despite being the favourite to gain the nomination lost to the local Trinity College lecturer, Dr Alan Williams, supported by very active Labour Party Branches in Carmarthen town and who went on to win the seat in the subsequent general election. Thomas duly retired from Parliament at the dissolution in 1987. He was married, 1958, to Margaret Indeg Thomas, the daughter of a minister with the Welsh Independents. They had one son and one daughter. They lived at Ffynnon Wen, Capel Hendre, Ammanford. Roger Thomas died on 1 September 1994 and was cremated at Swansea Crematorium.

Graduating with high marks, he entered the School of Engineers in 1931. The next year, he presented himself to the Peruvian Air Force to study as a cadet. He finished his military studies in 1935, assuming the rank of Sub-Ensign, and was assigned the post of flight instructor for cadets. In 1936, he was promoted to the rank of Flight Officer. Death On the morning of 14 September 1937, during a rehearsal for an airshow celebrating the inauguration of a monument to Jorge Ch√°vez, the airplane he was piloting started emitting smoke. On seeing this, Salazar ordered his copilot, a mechanical technician surnamed Fajardo, to parachute to safety. Fajardo initially protested, but followed orders. Salazar then purposely piloted away from urban areas. The plane crashed in a field in the seaside district of Miraflores, killing Southwell. The field was dedicated as a park in his memory, and a monument honoring him was erected there in 1953.

The ship was completed after the start of the Russo- Japanese War in February 1904 and was assigned to the Second Pacific Squadron sent to the Far East six months later to break the Japanese blockade of Port Arthur. The Japanese captured the port while the squadron was in transit and their destination was changed to Vladivostok. Oryol was badly damaged during the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905 and surrendered to the Japanese, who put her into service under the name of Iwami (). Reconstructed by the Japanese in 1905‚Äì1907, Iwami was reclassified by the Imperial Japanese Navy as a coastal defense ship in 1912. She participated in the Battle of Tsingtao at the beginning of World War I and supported the Japanese troops that landed in Siberia in 1918 during the Russian Civil War. Iwami was used as a training ship beginning in September 1921. The ship was disarmed in 1922 to comply with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty and sunk as a target ship two years later. Design and description Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in alt=A black and white drawing of a large ship, from the top and from the side The Borodino-class ships were based on the design of the French-built , modified to suit Russian equipment and building practices. They were built under the 1898 program \\"for the needs of the Far East\\" of concentrating ten battleships in the Pacific.Gribovsky, p. 3 Oryol was long overall, had a beam of and a draft of around at deep load. Designed to displace , she was more than overweight and actually displaced . This caused a problem during her sister's sea trials on 6 October 1903 when Imperator Aleksandr III made a high-speed turn that caused her to heel 15¬∞ and submerged the embrasures for the guns. The ship's crew consisted of 28 officers and 826 enlisted men.McLaughlin 2003, pp. 136‚Äì138, 140 The ship was powered by a pair of four- cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, using steam generated by 20 Belleville boilers. The engines were rated at and designed to reach a top speed of . Oryols engines, however, only achieved during her official machinery trials on 10 September 1904, although the ship was able to reach her designed speed. She carried enough coal to allow her to steam for at a speed of .McLaughlin 2003, pp. 137, 144 The Borodinos' main battery consisted of four guns mounted in two twin-gun turrets, one forward and one aft of the superstructure. The secondary armament consisted of 12 Canet quick- firing (QF) guns, mounted in twin-gun turrets. A number of smaller guns were carried for defence against torpedo boats. These included twenty 75-millimeter QF guns and twenty Hotchkiss guns. She was also armed with four torpedo tubes, one each at the bow and stern above water and two submerged on the broadside. Oryols waterline armor belt consisted of Krupp armor and was thick. The armor of her gun turrets had a maximum thickness of and her deck ranged from in thickness. She had anti-torpedo bulkheads thick.McLaughlin 2003, pp. 136‚Äì137 Construction and career Orel under construction, c. 1903 Construction began on Oryol (Eagle)Silverstone, p. 380 on 7 November 1899 at the Baltic Works in Saint Petersburg. The ship was laid down on 1 June 1900 and launched on 19 July 1902, in the presence of the Emperor. While fitting out in Kronstadt in May 1904 in preparation for the installation of her armor, some temporary sheathing was removed that allowed water to enter and sank the ship five days later. The water was pumped out and the ship refloated without incident.McLaughlin 2003, pp. 136, 138 She was completed in October 1904Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 184 at the cost of 13,404,000 rubles.McLaughlin 2003, pp. 136, 142 Orel under tow, Kronstadt, October 1904 On 15 October 1904, Oryol set sail for Port Arthur from Libau along with the other vessels of the Second Pacific Squadron, under the overall command of Vice Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky.Forczyk, p. 9 Rozhestvensky led his squadron down the Atlantic coast of Africa, rounding the Cape of Good Hope, and reached the island of Nosy Be off the north-west coast of Madagascar on 9 January 1905 where they remained for two months while Rozhestvensky finalized his coaling arrangements. The squadron sailed for Camranh Bay, French Indochina, on 16 March and reached it almost a month later to await the obsolete ships of the 3rd Pacific Squadron, commanded by Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov. The latter ships reached Camranh Bay on 9 May and the combined force sailed for Vladivostok on 14 May. With all of the additional coal and other supplies loaded for the lengthy voyage, the ship was overweight; most of which was stored high in the ship and reduced her stability. The most important aspect of this, however, was that the additional weight completely submerged the ship's main armor belt.McLaughlin 2003, pp. 141, 167 Rozhestvensky decided to take the most direct route to Vladivostok using the Tsushima Strait and was intercepted by the Japanese battlefleet under the command of Admiral T≈çg≈ç Heihachir≈ç on 27 May 1905. At the beginning of the battle, Oryol was the last ship in line of the 1st Division, which consisted of all four Borodino-class battleships under Rozhestvensky's direct command. The ship fired the first shots of the Battle of Tsushima when the ship's captain, Nikolay Yung, ordered her to open fire at a Japanese cruiser that was shadowing the Russian formation at a range of . Rozhestvensky had not given any pre-battle instructions to the fleet covering this situation, but he ordered Yung to cease fire after 30 rounds had been fired without effect.Forczyk, pp. 56, 58 Damage to Oryol after the Battle of Tsushima Oryol was not heavily engaged during the early part of the battle, but she was set on fire by Japanese shells during this time.Forczyk, p. 63 About an hour after the battle began, the fired two torpedoes at a ship that may have been Oryol, although both torpedoes missed. The Russian formation had become disordered during the early part of the battle and Oryol was second in line after her sister by 16:00. The Japanese battleships generally concentrated their fire on Borodino during this time and sank her around 19:30. Oryol was hit a number of times as well, but was not seriously damaged.Campbell, pp. 131‚Äì132, 135 Oryol took the lead after Borodino was sunk; she was joined by Nebogatov's Second Division after T≈çg≈ç ordered the Japanese battleships to disengage in the gathering darkness. Nebogatov assumed command of the remains of the fleet and they continued towards Vladivostok. The ships were discovered by the Japanese early the following morning and attacked by T≈çg≈ç's battleships around 10:00. The faster Japanese ships stayed beyond the range at which Nebogatov's ships could effectively reply and he decided to surrender his ships at 10:30 as he could neither return fire nor close the range.Forczyk, pp. 70‚Äì71 The ship was formally stricken from the Navy List on 13 September 1905.McLaughlin 2003, p. 146 Some of the damage suffered by Orel During the battle, Oryol was probably hit by five 12-inch, two , nine , thirty-nine 6-inch shells, and 21 smaller rounds or fragments. Although the ship had many large holes in the unarmored portions of her side, she was only moderately damaged as all of the four (one 12-inch and three 6-inch) shells that hit her side armor failed to penetrate. The left gun of her forward 12-inch turret had been struck by an 8-inch shell that broke off its muzzle and another 8-inch shell struck the roof of the rear 12-inch turret and forced it down, which limited the maximum elevation of the left gun. Two 6-inch gun turrets had been jammed by hits from 8-inch shells and one of them had been burnt out by an ammunition fire. Another turret had been damaged by a 12-inch shell that struck its supporting tube. Splinters from two 6-inch shells entered the conning towerCampbell, p. 238 and wounded Yung badly enough that he later died of his wounds.Forczyk, p. 25 Casualties totaled 43 crewmen killed and approximately 80 wounded. Japanese career as Iwami Oryol after the Battle of Tsushima, mid-1905 As Oryol followed the First Division of the Combined Fleet back to Japan after the battle, she developed a list to starboard and her engines began to fail. Escorted (and occasionally towed) by the battleship and the armored cruiser , she was diverted to Maizuru Naval Arsenal for emergency repairs that lasted until 29 July. While under repair, she was renamed Iwami on 6 June,Lengerer 2008b, p. 64 after the eponymous province, now part of Shimane prefecture.Silverstone, p. 331 Iwami at anchor at Kure, 2 November 1907 The Japanese substantially rebuilt Iwami at Kure Naval Arsenal and officially recommissioned her into the Imperial Japanese Navy on 2 November 1907.Lengerer 2008b, p. 66 To reduce her top weight, her funnels were shortened, her fighting tops removed, and her superstructure reduced in height. Her twin six-inch gun turrets were removed and replaced by half a dozen eight-inch guns on pedestal mounts that were protected by gun shields. The fore and aft eight-inch guns were repositioned one deck lower, on the same level as the midships guns, and the midships 75-millimeter gun positions were plated over.McLaughlin, p. 452 The 75-millimeter guns were replaced by sixteen Japanese-built QF 12-pounder, 12 cwt\\"Cwt\\" is the abbreviation for hundredweight, 12 cwt referring to the weight of the gun. gunsJentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 21 and two submerged broadside 18-inch torpedo tubes replaced her original torpedo armament. Her boilers were replaced by an unknown number of Japanese-built Miyabara water-tube boilers. These changes reduced her displacement to approximately McLaughlin 2003, pp. 452‚Äì453 and her crew now totaled 806 officers and crewmen. Iwami was assigned to the 1st Fleet on 26 November 1907 although she participated in the 1908 naval maneuvers as part of the 2nd Fleet before rejoining the 1st Fleet the following year. On 1 September 1912, the ship was reclassified as a second- class coastal defense ship. Shortly after the start of World War I in 1914, Iwami was assigned to the 2nd Division of the 2nd Fleet, formed from captured Russian ships. The division blockaded the port and bombarded German defenses during the Siege of Tsingtao in August‚ÄìNovember 1914. In 1915 Iwami was a guardship at Kure, but she did participate in that year's naval maneuvers and subsequent fleet review. Iwami at anchor She was assigned to the 5th Division of the 3rd Fleet on 7 January 1918 as its flagship and landed a company of marines in Vladivostok five days later at the start of the Japanese intervention in Siberia during the Russian Civil War.McLaughlin 2008, p. 69Head, p. 55 Iwami returned to Kure on 9 September and was subsequently relieved from her assignment with the 3rd Fleet. The ship was assigned to defend Kamchatka from 24 September 1920 to 30 June 1921 and was based in Vladivostok and Petropavlovsk. She was reclassified as a first-class coast defense ship in September 1921 and was used as a training ship. In accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, Japan agreed to scrap Iwami. She was disarmed in April 1922 and used as a depot ship until she was struck on 1 September. Iwami moored to the west of the island of J≈çgashima near the mouth of Tokyo Bay and used as a target by aircraft of the Yokosuka Naval Air Group from 5‚Äì8 July, finally sinking on 10 July 1924.

A follower of Neostoicism, he sought to resolve the doubts he still had about his conversion to Catholicism, according to STUDIA RUDOLPHINA - Bulletin of the Research Center for Visual Arts and Culture in the Age of Rudolf II. He was born in Konstanz (Constance) in 1550 in a Lutheran Protestant family and studied in Strasbourg, Geneva and Padua. He was supported and promoted by Johannes Crato von Krafftheim, who put his way into the circle of Renaissance humanism in Northern Europe in Breslau. On Crato's and Hubert Languet's recommendation, he became tutor in noble houses. In 1574 he traveled from Vienna to Italy, where he met Jakob Monau and Fabier Ien de Dohna. In 1575 he received his doctorate in Padua. As a steward, he accompanied the son of Nicholas of Rhediger on the Grand Tour (peregrinatio Academica). In 1576 he returned to Breslau and became the confidant of bishop Andreas von Jerin. In 1591 Wackenfels was Chancellor of the Upper Silesian provincial team. In 1583 he married Sophie Poley in Dresden (1563-92), a sister of Wroclaw businessman and gentleman on animal garden Christoph Poley. In 1592 Wackenfels converted to the Catholic faith and in 1594, he was in the Ennoblement. In 1595 he married his second wife Catherine of Troilo, being then Franz Troilo's brother-in-law, a sister of his first wife and second daughter of Johann Franz Troilo, and allied himself with one of the most influential families in Wroclaw. In the spring of the same year, he made an invitation to his friend Valens Acidalius to go to Neisse. In 1597, he was appointed to the Aulic Council, where he served until 1612, from 1608 as a trainee. In 1611 he has devoted his friend Johannes Kepler, who dedicated to him his \\"Strena seu nive sexangula\\" (From hexagonal snow; see: Kepler conjecture) (1611).

It is located on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River, 70 km east of Quebec City on Route 132. Cap-Saint-Ignace is located on the scenic chemin des Pionniers Ouest, also known as Highway 132, at the Junction of the route du Petit-Cap which is accessible from provincial Autoroute 20, the Autoroute Jean-Lesage. The town's total area is 227 km2 and borders the scenic St. Lawrence River with privileged access to the river and migratory bird sanctuaries.  Motto and emblems  The town's motto, Mets le cap sur la vaillance, translates as \\"Vigilance is your bearing\\" and provides the people of Cap-Saint-Ignace with the popular nickname of \\"les Vaillants\\". Named after its protector, Saint Ignatius of Loyola, the town's emblems are the native blue flax and the eastern bluebird. The blue flax, native to the countryside, is attributed many qualities both as clothing linen and for its medicinal properties. The eastern bluebird frequents the local orchards, farms, hedgerows and rock dikes in the area and is renowned for its songbird qualities.  Local attractions  Vincelotte Windmill (1690) The Petit-Cap (\\"Little Cape\\") and the ancient government pier are amongst the local attractions (parking on-site but foot-access only). The area is dotted with trails, observations posts and rest areas with interpretive panels on the local fauna, flora and the areas' rich and colourful history. The fall migration of snow geese, amongst other species, is most spectacular. For cyclists, the chemin des Pionniers Ouest provides countless hours of scenic riding. Locally, there are four main cycle circuits: Route Verte or Green circuit follows the River through the Town; the Route des pommes or Apple circuit (11 km) takes cyclists by the orchards; the Campagnard or Country trek (21 km) brings cyclists through the local maple sugar and produce areas; and the Seigneurial trek (14.7 km) takes cyclists to and near the historical landmarks. Many of these are natural and preserved sites, pleasant to view and enjoy, but travellers are requested to respect private property. Cycling circuits include rest areas and places where travellers can purchase meals, snacks, refreshments and souvenirs. There are many events throughout the year in Cap-Saint-Ignace. Not the least is the Feast of the Saint-Hubert (1‚Äì3 Sep) held in honour of the Saint and patron of hunters, complete with a procession and solemn mass to the sound of French horns accompanying the great organ pipes, meal, clay pigeon shoot, equestrian demonstrations and other activities related to the hunt.

It opened its first short line and a wet dock at Llanelly in 1834, and soon went on to build a longer line from Llanelly to serve pits in the Amman Valley, and then on to Llandilo, reached in 1857. The Llanelly company leased and worked the Vale of Towy Railway on to Llandovery, from 1858. Responding to competitive pressure the company obtained authorisation to connect its network to Swansea and Carmarthen, but the failure of a contractor put the company into financial difficulty, and a financial reconstruction later led to the Swansea and Carmarthen lines passing to the London and North Western Railway, while the original core system was taken over by the Great Western Railway. The line from Swansea to Llandovery became part of the Central Wales Line connecting to Shrewsbury and the north-west, but after the 1960s only the Llanelli to Llandovery line and short colliery connections in the Amman Valley remained in use. Before 1971 many place names had Anglicised spelling. The railway system was slow to convert the names of railway locations. For consistency, this article generally uses contemporary spellings. Prior to the Llanelly Dock Company In the eighteenth century minerals had been extracted in the area around Llanelly, and smelting of metals was taking place locally well before the end of that century. Conveyance of heavy minerals over the primitive roads of the day was an expensive and difficult business. Alexander Raby purchased mineral-bearing lands about 1795 and constructed tramways to bring the minerals to a smelting plant he owned at Furnace, near Llanelly. The tramways were wooden waggonways, and they extended to a harbour at Llanelly for onward transport of the finished product by coastal shipping. There were extensive mineral deposits further inland at Cross Hands, and exploitation of the minerals needed a longer railway; the distance was 16 miles and Raby was the prime mover in the formation of the Carmarthenshire Tramroad for the purpose. The Tramroad was the first railway in Wales to obtain an authorising Act of Parliament, which it did in June 1802; the capital was ¬£250,000. Charles Nevill came to Llanelly and in 1804 established a copper works with an associated harbour facility. There were extensive deposits of anthracite coal at Llangennech on the River Loughor estuary east of Llanelly, and about this time an expansion of the mining there took place, with associated construction of short tramroads. The Llangennech Coal Company was formed, and concentrated on shipping from Spitty (or Yspitty) on the Loughor. However the available quays were suitable only for small vessels, and the main trade was lighterage to Llanelly Harbour for transhipment, incurring additional expense.In double handling; the coal was said to be susceptible to damage in the loading process. When it was decided to develop the St Davids pit above Dafen, the opportunity to improve transport to the sea showed itself; a railway directly from Dafen to a new quay at Machynis Pool (now spelt Machynys) was feasible; there would need to be an incline down from St Davids to Dafen. The Llanelly Railroad and Dock Company Llanelly Railroad and Dock Company network in 1842The proprietors of the Llangennech Coal Company promoted a Bill in Parliament, to make a wet dock for vessels up to 300 tons at Machynis with wharves and warehouses, and build the railway to St Davids. The Act was passed on 19 June 1828, authorising the Llanelly Railroad and Dock Company, with share capital of ¬£14,000. Only horse traction could be used. At the time of the Committee hearings 83% of the capital had already been subscribed. The upper terminal was described as Gelly Gille Farm. Priestley reported on the Act: > This work was projected for the purpose of conveying the minerals and other > productions of the country near its line to the sea, and the dock was for > the readier shipment and landing of the exports and imports to be conveyed > thereon... [By the authorising act] the proprietors are incorporated under > the style of \\"The Llanelly Railroad and Dock Company.‚Äù... The dock [is] to > be so constructed as to be large enough for ships of three hundred tons > burthen, with slips, poles, beacons, warping and mooring buoys, chains and > capstans, and the company are to build wharfs, warehouses and other works > necessary for the purposes of the act. > The length of the railway is two miles and three hundred yards, in which > distance there is a rise of 68 feet above high water-mark; the dock is two > hundred yards by fifty-five at the bottom, calculated to hold twenty-one > vessels of three hundred tons as mentioned above; the depth is 16 feet below > high-water-mark of the highest spring tides, and the flood-gates at the > entrance are 36 feet wide. Mr. F. Foster estimated the whole at ¬£11,736, 3s. > 4d. including ¬£8,074, 10s. the cost of the dock and other conveniences. The > engineer‚Äôs estimate was subscribed for in equal portions by Messrs. D. T. > Shears, J. H. Shears, T. Margrave and W. Ellwood, Jun. The Act stipulated that the railway and the dock could only be opened together, not independently, and that had to be within five years. In fact the seam at the St Davids pit proved more elusive than expected, and was finally found in June 1832 at a depth of 660 feet, the deepest in Wales at the time. The delay meant that the works could not be completed within the authorised time, and a second Act was obtained allowed a time extension; it also permitted the use of steam locomotives on the line. The dock at Machynis, now called the New Dock, was completed in 1834, although the dock and railway appear to have been first used on 16 July 1833. It was stated to be the first public wet dock in Wales. The existence of the railway and the dock quickly led to considerable business, especially in the foreign export of coal; the East India Company was a particularly important customer. Not only the Llangennech Coal Company but numerous other pits came to use the line and the dock. The Company paid a 3% dividend in 1837 and 1838 and paid a remarkable 12% in 1839. Horse traction was used exclusively on the line for several years, but from January 1858 a locomotive was employed. Extending northwards With opening of the dock and the Dafen line in 1834, the Directors were already thinking of a railway line northwards from Llanelly and Llangennech to Llandilo. Such a line would open up access to known important coal deposits in the valley of the River Amman, and Llandilo was an important agricultural centre. The necessary Act was passed on 21 August 1835, and the Company was retitled the Llanelly Railway and Dock Company. The line was to run from the south side of the New Dock, avoiding interference with the Dafen line which ran to the north side. The main line would run through Llangennech, Pontardulais and Llandebie. There were to be thirteen branches, mostly short spurs to nearby pits but including one to Gelli Fawr and Garnant, and another to Cross Hands on Mynydd Mawr, later to be known as the Mountain Branch, or Great Mountain Branch. Opening to Pontardulais and Cwmamman The line from Pontardulais to the New Dock at Llanelly was opened for mineral traffic on 1 June 1839. From Pontardulais construction was directed towards the Amman Valley as having greater income potential than the rural route towards Llandilo. From Pontardulais to Cwmamman (later called Garnant) was opened on 10 April 1840 and the line was extended to Gwaun-cae-Gurwen on 6 May 1841. There were two rope worked inclines on the branch, one of them a mile in length. The (Great) Mountain branch opened on 6 May 1841 to goods and mineral traffic only; the route, included a half mile balanced cable incline at a gradient of 1 in 12. In 1841 the Company provided a return to the Board of Trade summarising certain aspects of the line's operation; significant portions of the line were operated by horse traction only. Where locomotives were used the speed was limited to 9 miles per hour. There was stated to be \\"scarcely any passenger traffic, coal and mineral produce being the chief and almost only trade over the line to Llanelly\\".Letter from Company Secretary dated 14 October 1841, quoted in Denman The passenger business appears to have been achieved by attaching passenger vehicles to mineral trains, without an organised timetable. Two locomotives were in use on the line from 1840. In June 1842 a further branch was opened, from Garnant (Cwmamman) to Brynamman. The continuing expansion of the mineral business resulted in five locomotives being in use on the line by 1847. Contract operation and passengers The South Wales Railway was planning a trunk main line from near Gloucester to Fishguard. The Llanelly company attempted to sell its line to the South Wales Railway, but that approach did not bear fruit, and in January 1850 a contract was made with Ianson, Fossick and Hackworth to work and maintain the line. They operated a through passenger service between Swansea and Llandilo from May 1850, consisting of omnibuses at each end and railway transit from Pontardulais and Duffryn. The contract had been intended to operate for seven years but it was terminated by mutual consent in August 1853. In 1850 the passenger trains on the line appeared in Bradshaw's guide; stations were at Llanelly Dock, Bynea, Llangennech, Pontardulais, Cross Inn and Garnant. South Wales Railway By this time the South Wales Railway was constructing its line from near Gloucester to Fishguard. (The western terminal was later changed to Neyland). The South Wales Railway, routed east to west, needed to cross both the lines of the Llanelly company, and the latter started to make obstructions to the process. The exact configuration of the crossing was not laid down in the South Wales Railway Act, and in the event of failure to agree arrangements the matter would have gone to a jury for determination. The Llanelly had experienced difficulty in obtaining subscriptions to complete its intended line to Llandilo, and for some time held out for the purchase by the SWR of its entire network for ¬£230,000. The SWR had no wish to acquire a narrow gauge (as was described at the time) mineral branch line, and for some time considered a viaduct to avoid the flat crossing of the Llanelly lines, which seemed to be the point at issue. The issue continued fruitlessly until the SWR opened its main line in October 1852; a flat crossing was provided and the Llanelly Company insisted on controlling the crossing. An exchange goods shed was built at the SWR station, served by a spur from the Llanelly Railway, opened in June 1853. The dock at Llanelly The Llanelly Railway and Dock network in 1858The dock at Llanelly was not walled, but had unimproved sloping margins; timber jetties with shoots were erected for loading vessels. The harbour pool was gated, and from time to time the provision of a second set of gates forming a lock was considered, but not proceeded with. Hydraulic machinery was provided from March 1858 by the Llanelly Dock Hydraulic Company, an entity evidently established for the purpose. With the South Wales Railway established, there was pressure to connect the dock at Llanelly to it by a broad gauge connection so as to bring business to the dock. The Dock was an intrinsic part of the Llanelly company's business, but once again it engaged in attempts to get the SWR to pay for the branch. These were fruitless, and the Llanelly company eventually built it, opening it in January 1859. Extending to Llandilo The company now returned to the extension to Llandilo; with the financial performance improved, it was possible to seek further finance, and in 1853 it obtained an Act re-authorising the Llandilo line with considerable new capital. Included was the possibility of building it to the broad gauge and converting the existing network similarly, leaving open the option of selling the concern to the SWR. On 1 March 1855 a contract was let for the work, and the line was opened ceremonially to Llandilo on 20 January 1857,Denman; but on page 57 he says, referring to Llandilo, \\"The line from the south carried traffic from 1st January 1857, being formally opened on 21st January\\". and to the public on 24 January. A local newspaper reported that it was now possible to look forward to the day when Llandilo would be connected by rail with ports in the north of England. Vale of Towy Railway Llandovery railway station building in 2011The connection to the north of England was to be facilitated by the independent Vale of Towy Railway. In 1853 a Parliamentary Bill had been presented, and as it was unopposed, its passage easily led to the Royal Assent being granted on 10 July 1854, for a line from Llandovery to Llandilo. Capital was ¬£55,000 and mixed gauge track was authorised, as sale to the Great Western Railway or its allies was still contemplated. It opened its line to passengers on 1 April 1858, but goods trains had been running since either 17 February or 1 March. It was just over 11 miles long and had five wooden viaducts over the Towy. It was worked by the Llanelly company. There were intermediate stations at Lampeter Road (later renamed Llanwrda), Llangadog, and Glanrhyd from the outset.Denman; but he says on page 57 that a \\"platform was erected allowing the station to open on 1st May 1858.\\" and a station was opened at Talley Road shortly after the general opening to passengers. The Llanelly Railway station at Llandilo was used by Vale of Towy trains. The Vale of Towy (Leasing) Act came into force on 2 August 1858 and authorised the Llanelly Railway and Dock Company to lease the Vale of Towy line. The lease was for an initial ten years with an option later to extend it. In fact the LR&DC; became alarmed that other railway companies were taking an interest in the Vale of Towy, and they included conversion of the lease term to perpetuity in a general Act they obtained on 23 July 1860. In fact the Act authorised but did not compel the conversion of the lease term, and negotiations between the two companies were tense and protracted, and in July 1865 Vale of Towy shareholders rejected a draft lease that had been negotiated. Already in November 1863 the Central Wales Extension Railway had approached the Vale of Towy about a lease; this line was to connect from the north, and eventually formed part of the Central Wales line, on which the passenger operation is marketed at the present time as the Heart of Wales Line. The Swansea Vale Railway Glanrhyd station in 1999The Swansea Vale Railway had started life as a mineral line running north-east from Swansea. In 1861 it obtained Parliamentary authorisation to extend to Brynamman, approaching from the east; this part of the line was known as the Swansea Vale Extension Railway, and it opened on 1 January 1864 for mineral traffic. By the end of 1864 through operation between the Swansea Vale Extension and the Llanelly Railway was established at Brynamman, and the two lines formed a significant through route for goods traffic from Swansea to Liverpool. In May 1864 a passenger service to Brynamman was established on the Swansea Vale line. The Llanelly company decided to start its own passenger service to Brynamman, extending the existing Garnant branch service. The Board of Trade were asked to carry out the necessary formal inspection to approve passenger working, but the proposed method of operation, by telegraph and block system, was not considered safe for passenger operation on a single line. A further inspection in March 1865 noted that the terminus station at Brynamman was to be on a gradient of 1 in 57, an arrangement also considered unsafe, and authorisation was again postponed. Authorisation for passenger working on the Llanelly line was given on 20 March 1865; it is not recorded how the considerable gradient easement was achieved. It appears that the two companies had their Brynamman stations alongside one another. The Llanelly company announced that passenger services would start on 20 March 1865; Garnant station appears to have been closed, and was relocated \\"half a mile down the branch\\" and re-opened at the same time. The SVR was authorised to open its passenger service to Brynamman on 27 February 1868, and agreement was reached for interchange arrangements at the station. The Swansea Vale Railway was absorbed by the Midland Railway. Llanelly Railway and Dock network The sequence of stations at Llanelly developed over time; the first (1839) station was close to the dock, on the direct line from Llandilo. In 1852 a platform was opened adjacent to the newly opened South Wales Railway station, reached by a line on from the earlier station by a westward sweep close to the dock itself, then running for some distance immediately on the south side of the South Wales Railway main line, which was broad gauge at this time. The connecting line towards the SWR station was made more direct, and a third \\"Dock\\" station opened in 1869 replacing the first station. In this period, trains called at both stations, referred to as \\"Llanelly\\" and \\"Dock\\" (or \\"Llanelly Docks\\") in timetables respectively. In 1879, the layout and station arrangements were simplified, as described below. Reaching Swansea and Carmarthen Throughout this period, Swansea had been growing in importance as an industrial centre, and its docks had been, much extended and enhanced. At the same time Llanelly Dock had stagnated, and its limitations were evident. The Swansea Vale extension line to Brynamman (aligned to the Midland Railway) and the South Wales Railway (by now absorbed by the Great Western Railway) gave easy access for local industry to Swansea, to the disadvantage of Llanelly. At the same time Carmarthen was an important centre in its own right, and the importance of the harbours on Milford Haven was growing. The Llanelly company could not afford to ignore the potential of a connection to Swansea and Carmarthen, even though it would diminish the value of its own dock. Since the Company was short of capital, the way forward had to include a means of financing the new lines. On successive days in October 1860, rival entrepreneurs waited on the Llanelly Board with proposals for connecting the line. Richard Kyrke Penson, Thomas Savin and a man named Johns proposed that the Llanelly company promote railways from Pontardulais to Swansea, from Llandilo to Carmarthen, and from Llandovery to Brecon, which they would finance. Accordingly, they would take a ten-year lease of the Llanelly Company; at the time the Llanelly Company was only earning 1% and an apparently guaranteed 4% (after five years) appeared very attractive. The following day Henry Robertson appeared proposing joint construction of the Swansea and Carmarthen lines with the Central Wales Railway, and running powers over the Central Wales line from Craven Arms, not far from Shrewsbury on the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway. The Llanelly directors favoured Penson and his partners, and the arrangement was agreed at a shareholders‚Äô Extraordinary General Meeting on 31 October 1860. The partners soon turned out to be insubstantial, as Johns and then Savin withdrew. Having lost their source of finance and project management, the Llanelly company proceeded with the Swansea and Carmarthen lines themselves, running into considerable practical and financial difficulties from landowners and otherwise in the process. The Central Wales Extension Railway was naturally keen for the lines to be completed, and it facilitated friendly contact with the London and North Western Railway and the Llanelly company; could not the LNWR finance the new railways; in fact would not full amalgamation be desirable? Proposals were worked up for a new line from Pontardulais to Swansea, taking a southern sweep through Dunvant, where there were said to be extensive unworked coal measures. There was to be a branch from that line to Penclawdd. A second line was to run from Llandilo back to Carmarthen, joining the Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway at a junction at Abergwili, a mile or so north of Carmarthen. The C&CR; was broad gauge at that time, and a third rail to make mixed gauge would need to be laid. Notwithstanding considerable opposition, the Llanelly Railway (New Lines) Act 1861 was passed on 1 August authorising these routes. The Act separated the company for financial purposes into two undertakings, the \\"Original Line\\", and the \\"New Lines\\" (the Swansea line and the Carmarthen line). This seems not to have been intended for any other purpose than clarity of accounting, but it was later to encourage an unforeseen separation. The line at Swansea was to divide there, the passenger terminal being at a low level, and a high level line was to continue to the docks, crossing the River Tawe. Opening to Carmarthen Construction of the line was considered to offer no great difficulty, but the Board of Trade inspector's report of May 1865 required considerable improvements before opening. The company dragged its feet over complying with even trifling improvements required, and moreover started running passenger excursion trains on 29 May 1865 (to an Eisteddfod), and a regular passenger service from 1 June 1865. First goods trains ran on 8 or 14 November 1865.Barrie and Baughan say 14 November 1865 in \\"South Wales\\" and Baughan says 14 November 1864 in \\"North and Mid Wales\\" The line diverged from the old main line at Carmarthen Valley Junction; stations were at Golden Grove, Llanarthney and Abergwili and also Llandilo Bridge and Nantgaredig. Income on the line was seriously less than had been planned for, and in particular the lucrative through traffic to western harbours was disappointing. Opening to Swansea LMS Stanier Black 5 at Swansea Victoria. On 9 November 1865 mineral traffic started on the Swansea line, although volumes were small at first.Denman; in a caption to an image on page 73 he says that \\"goods\\" traffic started in January 1866. MacDermot agrees January 1866. The failure of the financing scheme had forced the Llanelly company into borrowing at high rates of interest. Moreover, the poor income on the Carmarthen line further reduced the company's trading situation. The New Lines section of the Llanelly Company, which was separately financed, was plunged into financial difficulty, and it went into administration in January 1867. Passenger operation on the Swansea line started on 14 December 1867. The first through train from Llandovery to Swansea ran on 1 January 1868. The Penclawdd branch from Gower Road at the same time to serve local collieries (and later the Elba steel works). The LNWR outmanoeuvres the Llanelly Company In July 1867 Richard Moon of the LNWR and some other directors made a tour of Wales, during which they met the directors of the Llanelly Company. The Llanelly proposed offering running powers over their line in return for financial help from the LNWR. Moon was an astute negotiator, and did not disclose the LNWR's wish to gain access for LNWR traffic on the Central Wales line to and from Swansea. He simply agreed to consider the Llanelly proposal. Meanwhile, the lease of the Vale of Towy line was nearing its full term and had to be renegotiated. The Vale of Towy was naturally playing off possible lessees against one another, and was looking for a hefty cash lease charge; cash which the Llanelly could not find. The consequence was that the LNWR shared the lease with the Llanelly Company, paid off some Llanelly debt, and accepted the offer of running powers, at a stroke getting LNWR access to Swansea and Carmarthen as well as Llanelly and Brynamman. The big companies take over The Llanelly Railway and Dock network after the separation of the New Lines in 1873The New Lines being in receivership, there arose criticisms that the solvent original line was funding the deficit of the New Lines, and a receiver, John Henry Koch, was appointed in 1870. He moved to create a truly independent company, the Swansea and Carmarthen Railway, which was incorporated on 16 June 1871. The New Lines were worked by the LNWR from 1 July 1871. A series of petty disputes over working arrangements and charges arose, and the LNWR announced that it (through the Swansea and Carmarthen Railway) would start operating the train service on the Vale of Towy line. The Great Western Railway converted the gauge of its lines in South Wales in 1872, in a massive operation. The former obstruction to through operation, most important for mineral traffic, was removed. The Llanelly Company observed that the Swansea and Carmarthen Railway, which it had created itself, was aligned to the LNWR, and the Llanelly had become a smaller network and felt itself vulnerable. At the same time the GWR observed that the LNWR now had access to Swansea, and saw that if the Llanelly company failed its lines would fall into the hands of the LNWR. Accordingly, an agreement was struck, whereby the GWR took over the Llanelly company's original lines from 1 January 1873. Ordinary Llanelly shareholders were to receive 5% dividends paid by the GWR, rising to 5.5% from 1877. The Llanelly company had retained a share (with the LNWR) of the lease of the Vale of Towy, and that line now became joint between the GWR and the LNWR. The antagonism between the S&CR; and the Llanelly company (or between the LNWR and the GWR) grew over the following period to the point where passengers and goods customers were seriously inconvenienced. The matter was finally brought to a close when the LNWR acquired the Swansea line in 1873 (authorised by Act of 1 July). The LNWR operated four passenger and three goods trains a day to Swansea, as well as two goods trains to Llanelly. This left the Carmarthen line as the only asset of the Swansea and Carmarthen line. As it had no significant income except as a through line, it was vulnerable commercially. In 1873 it changed its name to the Central Wales and Carmarthen Junction Railway. The little company decided to be robust in its dealings with the LNWR and a dispute led to the LNWR discontinuing working of local traffic from 1 April 1880, only accepting passengers and goods from local stations to and from its own line. The antagonism dragged on for many years, finally being resolved when the CW&CJR; sold its line to the LNWR for ¬£137,500 cash, from 1 July 1891. The LNWR extended the Penclawdd branch by miles to Llanmorlais in 1877 and a passenger service was started on 1 March 1884. The view from Euston G P Neele, Superintendent of the line on the LNWR, had accompanied Richard Moon on the 1867 visit, and later recorded his view of the events: > Between the Great Western and the North Western a singular fate attended the > Llanelly Railway. Amalgamations and absorption of small lines have been > common enough but disintegration is unusual; in this case however it was > carried out. The line from Llandovery to Llandilo became joint London and > North Western and Great Western Railway:- the portion from Llandilo, > Pantyffynnon and Pontardulais and thence to Llanelly became Great Western > property:- from Pontardulais to Swansea the North Western were proprietors; > running powers being exercised over the intervening distance to Llandilo. > The remaining portion of the Llanelly system ran from Llandilo Bridge to a > junction at Abergwili with the Carmarthen line. This became North Western > property, but between Llandilo and Llandilo Bridge there existed a piece of > debatable ground about with disputed powers which led to some difficulties > in 1871. > At Abergwili the line entered on a gauge () to Carmarthen and at that town > reached the termination of the narrow gauge; the line thence to Carmarthen > Junction where the Great Western was joined being exclusively broad gauge. > This Llanelly group of lines, all narrow gauge, was far from being up to > date. The stations and platforms were dilapidated, the crossing loops short, > the permanent way weak. Route simplification at Llanelly The Llanelly company's passenger trains approached from the north-east and crossed the GWR (former South Wales Railway) main line obliquely on the level. The line then ran on to a Llanelly Dock station. In 1879 a connecting spur was laid in at the point of intersection, and approaching trains from Pontardulais joined the GWR main line and ran to the GWR station. > On Monday, the Llanelly Dock Passenger Station will be closed by the Great > Western Railway Company, and, in future, passengers will only be booked at > Llanelly station. This will be a convenience as far as booking per London > and North Western route is concerned, as, previously, passengers had to > proceed to the dock to get their tickets, but passengers to and from the > dock will, in future, have to tramp it, unless some of our buses take up the > matter and run down there. Here is a good opening for a tramway. After 1879 The Vale of Towy Railway was jointly leased by the GWR and the LNWR; in 1884 that was converted to full joint ownership; the Vale of Towy was vested in the GWR and LNWR jointly by Act of 28 July 1884. The 1886 Brynamman West Station in 1962The Llanelly Railway station at Brynamman had always been cramped and inconvenient; in 1886 the GWR opened a new station to the west of the main road. It continued in use until passenger services were withdrawn in 1958. Having been leased by the GWR, the Llanelly company was fully absorbed by that company on 1 July 1889. Correspondingly the Central Wales and Carmarthen Junction Railway was vested in the LNWR by Act of 21 July 1891. The line between Swansea and Pontardulais was doubled by the LNWR by 1894 The very basic Swansea passenger station erected by the Llanelly company was modernised and improved by the LNWR in 1882. The twentieth century The St Davids colliery, which had been the original purpose of the first Llanelly Railroad and Dock Company, was no longer the principal location for coal extraction in the area, and the incline operation was inconvenient. In 1903 the line was diverted from Dafen to new collieries at Penprys and Acorn Pits, and the St Davids incline was closed. The first line to collieries at Gwaun-cae-Gurwen similarly involved difficult incline operation, and the GWR obtained an Act in 1904 authorising a new line avoiding the inclined plane. It opened on 4 November 1907; it had a 1 in 40 ruling gradient. Two halts were opened on the new line, and railmotors operated a passenger service from 1 January 1908 to 1 May 1926. There were eight trips a day. The passenger service was suspended during the General Strike of 1926 and never resumed. The earlier line was shortened back in 1933, becoming known as the Cawdor branch, and was later used chiefly for wagon storage. For many years the Great Western Railway had suffered from congestion in the Swansea area; a particular difficulty was the severe gradients at Cockett which required heavy trains to be banked and resulted in lengthy line occupation times. In the early years of the twentieth century consideration was given to relieving the issue, and the decision was taken to construct what became the Swansea District Line. This long new line left the main line near Briton Ferry and looped round to the north of Swansea, joining the Llanelly line near Bynea. To give good access for colliery traffic, there was a triangular junction there, so that coal traffic from the Amman valley could turn east on to the new line; at the same time express passenger trains (particularly Fishguard boat trains) could avoid Swansea using the line. The work was authorised on 15 August 1904, and opened throughout on 14 July 1913. In 1913 the GWR undertook improvements to the line between Pontardulais and Llanelly, providing double track, and widening the connection at Llandilo Junction by the provision of a new line from Genwen Junction to Llandilo Jn. (Pontardulais tunnel remained single). Throughout the first decades of the twentieth century, use of Llanelly Dock (now known as the Great Western Dock) declined; Swansea dock was nearer the centre of industry and was much enlarged and modernised over the years and Llanelly slowly became eclipsed. The Gwaun-cae-Gurwen improvements of 1907 had been followed up by obtaining powers on 18 August 1911 to build a through line from there to Felin Fran on the Swansea District Line, intended to further enhance the access to pits in the area. The line was partly constructed but never opened, due to World War I. However, in September 1922 the GWR opened the Cwmgorse branch southward from Gwaun-cae-Gurwen to Duke Colliery; this was a short stub of the through line. In 1960 the branch was further extended to Abernant Colliery by British Railways, and the branch continued in use until 1980. From 1923 At the beginning of 1923 the main line railways of Great Britain were \\"grouped\\" under the terms of the Railways Act 1921. The LNWR was a constituent of the new London Midland and Scottish Railway group (LMS); the Great Western Railway absorbed numerous smaller concerns but continued in the same identity as before. The LMS closed the Llanmorlais branch passenger service on 5 January 1931 and total closure of the branch followed on 2 September 1957. Emlyn colliery on the Mountain branch closed about 1947 and the upper part of the branch fell into decline; the branches serving collieries were almost entirely dependent on the mining, and when that declined and moved away, the branches suffered accordingly. After World War II following nationalisation, from the beginning of 1948 British Railways owned the railways in the area. The decline in mining continued and Cross Hands goods closed on 1 November 1950; the whole branch closed on 6 March 1963. Llanelly Harbour Trust had taken control of the Great Western Dock at Llanelli, but a review of port facility requirements in the area resulted in closure, and the Trust ceased trading in 1951. In due course the GWR Dock was filled in. Steam operation on the Llanelly network ceased in 1963 The St Davids line, serving Dafen and beyond, closed completely on 4 March 1963. The Brynamman passenger service was closed on 18 August 1958, and completely 28 September 1964. The Midland Railway station at Brynamman had closed 8 years earlier to passengers, on 25 September 1950. The Carmarthen line closed on 9 September 1963. The line from Pontardulais to Swansea closed to passengers on 15 June 1964, and from this date the passenger service on the Central Wales Line ran from Llanelli (later extended back to Swansea) to Shrewsbury. On 10 August 1964 the Central Wales line closed to through goods traffic, and to local freight in 1968. After closure of the Swansea line a section south from Pontardulais to Gorseinon colliery was retained. On 22 September 1974 a spur was opened onto Swansea District line enabling closure of the Pontardulais line. Glanamman remained open for goods traffic until 30 January 1965. Llandilo Jn to Morfa Jn and most dock lines at Llanelly closed on 24 January 1966. A modern coal train at Gwaun-Cae-Gurwen level crossingThe sole remaining colliery branch line was the line to Gwaun-cae-Gurwen. For some years this was dormant but in 2012 traffic started again, transporting coal required for blending purposes. In view of the discontinuation of coal firing in the country it is likely that this traffic will not continue. (2016) Gradients Gradients on the main line from Llanelli to Llandilo were significant, climbing at 1 in 157 to 1 in 108 for several miles to a summit at Derwydd Road, then falling at 1 in 108 for to Ffairfach. Derwydd Road at is the third highest point on the Central Wales Line. The Pontardulais to Swansea line was undulating with stiff alternating gradients; Dunvant was approached by at 1 in 72 eastbound and two miles /at 1 in 70 and 1 in 80 westbound. The Carmarthen line was gently graded all the way.

The argument for a commuter tax is that it pays for public services, such as police, fire, and sanitation, received by and beneficial to people who work within the jurisdiction levying the commuter tax. Arguments against such a tax are that it acts as an incentive for businesses to relocate outside of the jurisdiction, along with their residents. In some cases, individual cities may be barred from enacting a commuter tax even though the state governments may impose a non-resident income tax. States may choose to enter \\"reciprocal tax agreements\\" to exempt non-residents from some local taxes. Until 1999, New York City had a commuter tax, and there are periodic calls for its reinstatement. A commuter tax in New York City would have to have support from the State Legislature in order for reinstatement, and since the majority of state legislators represent people who do not live in New York City, the tax tends to be unpopular. While the city of New York is barred from charging its own commuter tax, the state of New York does impose an income tax on non- residents that work in the state. In 2009, New York enacted the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Mobility Tax, a 0.34% levy on payrolls and self- employment earnings in New York City and Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland, Orange, Putnam, and Dutchess counties. This tax, known popularly as the \\"mobility tax,\\" is intended to provide funds for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which transports many of the region's commuters. Philadelphia has a 3.924% wage tax on residents and a 3.495% tax on non- residents for wages earned in the city as of August 2013. Washington, D.C., has sought to enact a commuter tax to recover costs of providing city services to the approximately 300,000 people who commute to the city from suburban Maryland and Virginia. However, in the 1973 District of Columbia Home Rule Act, the U.S. Congress barred the city from enacting such a tax .Eric M.

The series is organized by Sailing World Magazine, and takes place in St. Petersburg, Florida, San Diego, California, Annapolis, Maryland, Detroit, Michigan, Chicago, Illinois, Seattle, Washington, Marblehead, Massachusetts, Larchmont, New York, and Houston, Texas. The organizers define the races in their Notice Of Race (NOR) to include boats of defined minimum size and equipment so at least in name they are capable of off-shore sailing. If a minimum number of one-design boats show an interest in a regatta, the organizer arranges for the class to have a separate starting sequence, or class start. In recent years the J/105 class sailboats has been the sailboat that often has the most boats in their class for any individual regatta, and has a class start in every NOOD regatta. In One-Design racing, sailboats compete against other boats in identical boats as defined by their class association, so the first boat over the finish line wins (as opposed to handicap racing, where sailboats of different designs compete against each other, and the winner is determined by calculations involving each boat's individual time, rating and the race course distance). In theory, since the boats are equal, it is the skill of the team of sailors on each boat that determines who wins the regatta.

Career =Early years and Manfred Mann= Flett began his career with local groups in Aberdeen such as Cat Squirrel, Once Upon a Band and Pinto. He later moved to London and joined an all-Aberdeen group called Jock. While he was living in London, he was recommended to Manfred Mann and subsequently joined Manfred Mann's Earth Band, with whom he made his debut on their 1975 autumn tour of America. He performed on two Earth Band studio albums, The Roaring Silence and Watch, which featured two hit singles in \\"Blinded by the Light\\" and \\"Davy's on the Road Again\\" respectively. =Thin Lizzy= After leaving Manfred Mann's Earth Band in 1978, he briefly toured as a temporary member of Thin Lizzy after Gary Moore left the group following a concert on 4 July 1979.Alan Byrne, \\"Thin Lizzy: Soldiers of Fortune\\", Firefly, 2004 After Midge Ure initially replaced Moore, Flett was recruited in early September 1979 as lead guitarist alongside Scott Gorham for a tour of Japan, while Ure switched to keyboards. Playing his first show with Thin Lizzy in Osaka on 24 September, Flett performed at five shows before the band returned home. During this tour, he and the band performed a number of songs that later surfaced on the Chinatown album the following year, such as \\"Didn't I\\" and \\"Sweetheart\\". In December he played a few Thin Lizzy shows that were arranged to compensate for missing the Reading Festival earlier in the year, and he left the group shortly before Christmas. He had wanted to remain with Thin Lizzy, but instead Snowy White was chosen as his permanent replacement, who went on to record two albums with the band. Flett described his short tenure with Thin Lizzy as \\"Great times with extremely talented, generous guys.\\"Scott Gorham and Harry Doherty, \\"Thin Lizzy: The Boys Are Back in Town\\", Omnibus Press, 2012, p. 134. After leaving Thin Lizzy, Flett formed a short lived band called Special Branch, with Matt Irving. On 11 August 1981, Flett joined Thin Lizzy onstage at a concert in his hometown of Aberdeen, as part of the Renegade tour. He said, \\"I did guest on a few numbers with them... [it] showed there were no hard feelings.\\" Later life Flett is now an addictions counselor in central Florida, and in 2004, spoke out to prove his identity amid false stories spread by a man impersonating him. Prompted by this experience, Flett wrote the song \\"Stolen Identity\\", and was subsequently inspired to record an album. With the help of a number of musicians including Manfred Mann and John Lingwood, Flett's first solo album, Flying Blind, was released in April 2014 for download.

Hope Park Church in St Andrews, Fife is a congregation of the Church of Scotland. Building The current building, by Peddie & Kinnear, was completed in 1865. It has notable stained glass windows and an unusual canopy above the pulpit. History The congregation can trace its origins back to the Associate Presbytery (led by the dissident Stirling minister Ebenezer Erskine), which broke away from the Church of Scotland in 1733. In 1738 a Kirk Session of a local congregation (initially worshipping outdoors) was recognised by the Associate Presbytery. From 1749 onwards the congregation have had meeting places in St Andrews - first in an old barn in Imrie's Close (now 136 South Street) then from 1774 in Burghers' Close (now 141 South Street), from 1827 in a purpose built chapel in North Street (no. 52) then from 1865 in the present building. The name Hope Park was suggested by the then minister the Rev. James Black. As the Associate Presbytery developed (and divisions emerged), the congregation ‚Äì based on the Voluntary rather than Establishment principle ‚Äì became associated with the Burghers, which in 1820 became the United Secession Church, which in turn became the United Presbyterian Church in 1847, which merged with the Free Church in 1900 to become the United Free Church of Scotland, which united with the Church of Scotland in 1929. The BBC radio series 'Sunday Half-Hour' was broadcast on 18 June 1950, conductor by Cedric Thorpe Davie (1913-1983), and 'Children's Hour' on 2 December 1952, conducted by then Minister the Rev. Wilfred Herbert Hulbert (1906-1968) who was appointed in 1947. The Organist during this period was Edward MacMahon. Ministry The current minister (since 2011) is the Reverend Allan McCafferty BSc BD, who was previously minister at Kirkwall East Parish Church, Orkney. He succeeded the Reverend David Arnott, who was minister from 1996 until 2010. On 27 October 2010 Mr Arnott was nominated to be the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland for 2011-2012.

Situated mainly atop a hill, this township is located along Old Klang Road and was opened in the mid 1970s. Places of interest Just down the hill lies Plaza OUG, the largest shopping mall in the locality, which is housing a Parkson (previously known as Yaohan) store. One can climb the hill and have a grandiose view of the whole garden. The residential roads here used to be in numbers (Jalan 1 to 40). However the local authorities decided to rename them to Hujan Emas (golden rain), Hujan Abu, Hujan Batu, Hujan Gerimis, Hujan Manik, Hujan Bubuk and so on. On Thursday nights, there is a night market (pasar malam) selling various hawker food, affordable apparels, decorations, daily usage items and toys. Recent developments As of 2006, roads connecting OUG to Bukit Jalil and Sri Petaling have opened, after several years of having the project delayed. These new stretch of roads reduced the traveling time of at least 10‚Äì15 minutes. In the past, to get to either Sri Petaling or Bukit Jalil, one needed to pass through the neighbouring residential area Happy Garden. There are rows of shop lots in OUG. Some of the shops in OUG are Kin San Kopitiam, 7-Eleven, Guardian Pharmacy, Kedai Gunting OUG, Restaurant New Sun Ho (coffee shop), Simon Poon Agency (General Insurance), Wow Wow Pets Shop, Caring Pharmacy and Kedai Runcit Fah Lian (grocery shop). The surrounding area which Plaza OUG and Central Plaza are located in has seen the mushrooming of eateries and nightlife activities. Most notable is Citrus Park containing Station 1 Cafe and a McDonald's. The Market Place, OUG is a new five-storey complex in Taman OUG, which will house a wet and dry market. Other features include a food court, Chinese restaurant, sports and recreational facilities as well as basement carpark. Places of sports and leisure The MCA hall is popular for tai chi exercise. On certain nights, dance classes are also conducted inside the hall. There are 2 basketball courts, one of which is located just opposite the Sun Kam Kee (formerly Hup Kee) Restaurant. For badminton enthusiasts, SJK (C) Yoke Nam, a primary school on Jalan Hujan Emas 6 provides a 5-court capacity hall for rent from 6pm to midnight, 6 days a week, excluding Sundays. For cyber gamers, there are also numerous cybercafes scattered around OUG. There is also a woodball course directly opposite the MCA hall. It was the first woodball course built in Malaysia, by Thomas Kok. In the year 2013 the course hosted its first woodball competition, SUKAN MALAYSIA XVI, KUALA LUMPUR 2013\\\\. Shopping Malls The Pearl Point Shopping Mall, Pearl Gallery, and OUG Plaza are the shopping highlights within the radius of OUG. They are located at the junction between Jalan Klang Lama and the main entrance connecting to OUG. Through the slip roads which recently opened, the residents can also get to Endah Parade much faster. Within 10 to 15 minutes drive from OUG is the much popular Mid Valley Megamall and The Gardens (Kuala Lumpur) shopping malls. Since mid-2011, The Scott Garden, a 3-level high end lifestyle retail circle was opened along Jalan Klang Lama, adding to the hustle and bustle area leading to OUG. WCT is building Paradigm OUG along Kesas Highway. Major Neighbouring Districts Two of the best-known neighbouring districts of OUG are Sri Petaling and Bukit Jalil suburbs. Bukit Jalil is where the Technology Park Malaysia is located and many well-known IT companies are headquartered there. Also, the Bukit Jalil National Stadium, which hosted the 1998 Commonwealth Games and 2017 Southeast Asian Games is also located here. Access As mentioned earlier, the Old Klang Road is the main thoroughfare serving Taman OUG and environs. Old Klang Road branches off to Jalan Puchong near here. It is roughly about 15 to 20 minutes drive away (via the Maju Expressway ) to Bukit Bintang in downtown Kuala Lumpur. The KESAS runs through the southern boundary of this township, while the NPE which runs through the northern flank and parallel to the KTM tracks, is a shortcut to Subang Jaya and Shah Alam. In terms of public transportation, the closest rail stations are arguably Awan Besar station on the LRT Sri Petaling Line and Petaling station on the KTM Komuter Tanjong Malim-Port Klang Line.

Wrest also played and recorded everything in his other project, Lurker of Chalice, which released two demos and one full length album in 2005 before dissolving that project. Whitehead also writes all the lyrics for Leviathan but has recognized that \\"I don't consider myself a poet, by any means.\\" Whitehead briefly ended Leviathan after the release of his fourth album Massive Conspiracy Against All Life in 2008, allegedly due to a legal struggle between himself and Moribund Records. Due to these issues, Wrest felt as though the project had no future. Whitehead was arrested on January 9, 2011 on charges of sexual assault and domestic violence. Wrest has confirmed in an interview, that the events surrounding his arrest and the accuser have inspired the music and theme of True Traitor, True Whore which was released through Profound Lore Records after Wrest signed with them in August, 2011 along with the announcement that he had revived Leviathan. Faced with six charges stemming from the incident, Wrest maintained his innocence and took the case to trial. In May 2012, Wrest was found not guilty of all charges except for one count of aggravated domestic battery. Leviathan's latest album, Scar Sighted was released on 3 March, 2015 on Profound Lore Records. In 2018, Whitehead revealed that he was working on the seventh Leviathan record and it will be titled Die to This. .

The Mughals were the victors and inflicted significant casualties among the Mewaris but failed to capture Pratap, who escaped. The Siege of Chittorgarh in 1568 had led to the loss of the fertile eastern belt of Mewar to the Mughals. However, the rest of the wooded and hilly kingdom was still under the control of the Rana. Akbar was intent on securing a stable route to Gujarat through Mewar; when Pratap Singh was crowned king (Rana) in 1572, Akbar sent a number of envoys entreating the Rana to become a vassal like many other Rajput leaders in the region. When the Rana refused to personally submit to Akbar, war became inevitable. The site of the battle was a narrow mountain pass at Haldighati near Gogunda in Rajasthan. Maharana Pratap fielded a force of around 3,000 cavalry and 400 Bhil archers. The Mughals were led by Raja Man Singh of Amber, who commanded an army numbering around 10,000 men according to Persian sources, Mewari sources give an account of 80,000 Mughal troops against the 20,000 strong Mewari army. While both accounts differ significantly in total numbers, they agree on the point that the Mughal army outnumbered the Mewari troops by a factor of four to one. After initial successes by the Mewari army in battle, the tide slowly turned against them. In a fierce battle in which Pratap found himself wounded, he called a tactical retreat. A few of his men under Jhala Man Singh covered the retreat in a rearguard action. Background After his accession to the throne, Akbar had steadily settled his relationship with most of the Rajput states, with the exception of Mewar, acknowledged as the leading state in Rajasthan. The Rana of Mewar, who was also the head of the distinguished Sisodia clan, had refused to submit to the Mughal. This had led to the Siege of Chittorgarh in 1568, during the reign of Udai Singh II, ending with the loss of a sizeable area of fertile territory in the eastern half of Mewar to the Mughals. When Rana Pratap succeeded his father on the throne of Mewar, Akbar dispatched a series of diplomatic embassies to him, entreating the Rajput king to become his vassal. Besides his desire to resolve this longstanding issue, Akbar wanted the woody and hilly terrain of Mewar under his control to secure lines of communication with Gujarat. The first emissary was Jalal Khan Qurchi, a favoured servant of Akbar, who was unsuccessful in his mission. Next, Akbar sent Man Singh of Amber (later, Jaipur), a fellow Rajput of the Kachhwa clan, whose fortunes had soared under the Mughals. But he too failed to convince Pratap. Raja Bhagwant Das was Akbar's third choice, and he fared better than his predecessors. Rana Pratap was swayed sufficiently to don a robe presented by Akbar and sent his young son, Amar Singh, to the Mughal court. This was, however, deemed unsatisfactory by Akbar, who wanted the Rana himself to submit to him in person. A final emissary, Todar Mal, was sent to Mewar without any favourable outcome. With diplomacy having failed, war was inevitable. Prelude Rana Pratap, who had been secure in the rock-fortress of Kumbhalgarh, set up his base in the town of Gogunda near Udaipur. Akbar deputed the Kachhwa, Man Singh, to battle with his clan's hereditary adversaries, the Sisodias of Mewar. Man Singh set up his base at Mandalgarh, where he mobilised his army and set out for Gogunda. Around north of Gogunda lay the village of Khamnor, separated from Gogunda by a spur of the Aravalli Range called \\"Haldighati\\" for its rocks which, when crushed, produced a bright yellow sand resembling turmeric powder (haldi). The Rana, who had been apprised of Man Singh's movements, was positioned at the entrance of the Haldighati pass, awaiting Man Singh and his forces. The battle commenced three hours after sunrise on 18 June 1576. Army strength Mewari tradition has it that the Rana's forces numbered 20,000, which were pitted against the 80,000-strong army of Man Singh. While Jadunath Sarkar agrees with the ratio of these numbers, he believes them to be just as exaggerated as the popular story of Rana Pratap's horse, Chetak, jumping upon Man Singh's war elephant. Jadunath Sarkar gives the Mughal army as 10,000 strong. Satish Chandra estimates that Man Singh's army consisted of 5,000‚Äì10,000 men, a figure which included both the Mughals and the Rajputs. According to Al Badayuni, who witnessed the battle, the Rana's army counted amongst its ranks 3,000 horsemen and around 400 Bhil archers led by Punja, the chieftain of Merpur. No infantry are mentioned. Man Singh's estimated forces numbered around 10,000 men. Of these, 4,000 were members of his own clan, the Kachhwas of Jaipur, 1,000 were other Hindu reserves, and 5,000 were Muslims of the Mughal imperial army. Both sides possessed war elephants, but the Rajputs bore no firearms. The Mughals fielded no wheeled artillery or heavy ordnance, but did employ a number of muskets. Army formation Rana Pratap's estimated 800-strong van was commanded by Hakim Khan Sur with his Afghans, Bhim Singh of Dodia, and Ramdas Rathor (son of Jaimal, who defended Chittor). The right wing was approximately 500-strong and was led by Ramshah Tanwar, the erstwhile king of Gwalior, and his three sons, accompanied by minister Bhama Shah and his brother Tarachand. The left wing is estimated to have fielded 400 warriors, including Bida Jhala and his clansmen of Jhala. Pratap, astride his horse, led some 1,300 soldiers in the centre. Bards, priests, and other civilians were also part of the formation and took part in the fighting. The Bhil bowmen brought up the rear. The Mughals placed a contingent of 85 skirmishers on the front line, led by Sayyid Hashim of Barha. They were followed by the vanguard, which comprised a complement of Kachhwa Rajputs led by Jagannath, and Central Asian Mughals led by Bakhshi Ali Asaf Khan. A sizeable advance reserve led by Madho Singh Kachhwa came next, followed by Man Singh himself with the centre. The Mughal left wing was commanded by Mulla Qazi Khan (later known as Ghazi Khan) of Badakhshan and Rao Lonkarn of Sambhar and included the Shaikhzadas of Fatehpur Sikri, kinsmen of Salim Chisti. The strongest component of the imperial forces were stationed in the pivotal right wing, which comprised the Sayyids of Barha. Lastly, the rear guard under Mihtar Khan stood well behind the main army. The Battle Due to the disparity between the two armies, the Rana chose to mount a full frontal assault on the Mughals, committing all of his men. The desperate charge initially paid dividends. Hakim Khan Sur and Ramdas Rathor ran through the Mughal skirmishers and fell upon the vanguard, while Ram Sah Tonwar and Bhama Shah wreaked havoc upon the Mughal left wing, who were forced to flee. They took refuge with their right wing, which was also being heavily pressured by Bida Jhala. Both Mulla Qazi Khan and the captain of the Fatehpur Sikri Shaikhzadas were wounded, but the Sayyids of Barha held firm and earned enough time for Madho Singh's advance reserves to enter the fray. After spooking the Mughal left wing, Ram Sah Tonwar manoeuvred himself towards the centre to join his commander. He was able to shield Pratap Singh successfully until he was slain by Jagannath Kachhwa. Soon, the Mughal van, which was being sorely pressed, was bolstered by the arrival of Madho Singh, elements of the left wing which had recovered, and remnants of Sayyid Hashim's skirmishers from the front. In the meantime, the two centres had clashed, and the fighting had become more conventional as the momentum of the Mewari charge was spent. Several Rajput writers and Abul Fazl talk of a face off between Rana and Man Singh However according to Jadunath Sarkar the Rana was unable to directly meet Man Singh and was mostly pitted against Madho Singh Kachhwa. The Dodia clan leader, Bhim Singh, did get to take on the Mughal commander atop his elephant and was killed. Looking to break the deadlock and regain momentum, the Maharana ordered his prize elephant, the \\"rank-breaking Lona\\" into the fray. Man Singh's riposte was to send in Gajmukta (\\"pearl among elephants\\") to confront Lona head-on. The men on the field were thrown around as the two mountain-like animals clashed against each other. Lona appeared to have the upper hand when its mahout was wounded by a bullet and he had to turn back. Another elephant by the name of Ram Prasad, the head of the stable and an animal much praised in Akbar's court, was pushed in to replace Lona. Two imperial elephants, Gajraj and Ran-madar, were sent in to relieve the wounded Gajmukta, and they charged at Ram Prasad. The driver of Ram Prasad was also wounded, this time by an arrow, and he fell off his mount. Husain Khan, a Mughal faujdar, leapt from his own elephant onto Ram Prasad and made the enemy animal a Mughal prize. With the loss of their war elephants, the Mughals were able to press the Mewaris from three sides, and soon their leaders began to fall one by one. The tide of the battle had shifted, and Rana Pratap soon found himself wounded by arrow and spear. Realising that the day was lost, Bida Jhala seized the royal umbrella from his commander and charged at the Mughals, claiming to be the Rana himself. His sacrifice, and that of 350 other soldiers who stayed behind and fought to buy time, allowed their Rana and half of their army to escape. The bravery of the Rajputs and the fear of ambush in the hills meant that the Mughals did not give chase, and this allowed Pratap Singh to fight another day. Ramdas Rathor was one of those slain on the field after over three hours of battle. The three sons of Ram Sah Tonwar‚ÄîSalivahan, Bahan, and Pratap Tonwar‚Äîjoined their father in death. Casualties There are different accounts of the casualties in the battle. *According to Jadunath Sarkar, the contemporary Mewari sources counted 46% of its total strength, or roughly 1,600 men, among the casualties. *According to Abul Fazl and Nizamuddin Ahmed, 150 of the Mughals met their end, with another 350 wounded while the Mewar army lost 500 men. *Badayuni says that 500 men were killed in the battle, of which 120 were Muslims. *Later Rajasthani chroniclers have raised the casualties to 20,000 in order to emphasize the scale of the battle. There were Rajput soldiers on both sides. At one stage in the fierce struggle, Badayuni asked Asaf Khan how to distinguish between the friendly and enemy Rajputs. Asaf Khan replied, \\"Shoot at whomsoever you like, on whichever side they may be killed, it will be a gain to Islam.\\"Smith, Akbar the Great Mogul, pp.108‚Äì109.Lal, Studies in Medieval Indian History, pp.171‚Äì172. K.S. Lal cited this example to estimate that Hindus died in large numbers as soldiers for their Muslim masters in medieval India. ch. 5. Factors Contributing to the Growth of Muslim Population. Aftermath With Rana Pratap able to make a successful escape, the battle failed to break the deadlock between the two powers. Subsequently, Akbar led a sustained campaign against the Rana, and soon, Goganda, Udaipur, and Kumbhalgarh were all under his control. Pressure was exerted by the Mughals upon the Rana's allies and other Rajput chiefs, and he was slowly but surely both geographically and politically isolated. The Mughals' focus shifted to other parts of the empire after 1579, which allowed Rana Pratap to recover much of the lost territory in the western parts of his kingdom. Chittor and the rest of eastern Mewar continued to remain under Mughal control. According to Satish Chandra, the Battle of Haldighati was, at best, \\"an assertion of the principle of local independence\\" in a region prone to internecine warfare. Honour was certainly involved. But it was the honour of Maharana Pratap at stake, not Rajput or Hindu honour.

Career  Kerr's \\"Merry Melodies\\" are the most popular collections of Scottish tunes ever published. Almost nothing is known of the publisher. \\"Kerr's First Collection of Merry Melodies for the Violin\\" (447 tunes) does not carry a date, but is thought to be from 1870 to 1875. The second collection (445 tunes), the third collection (446 tunes) and the fourth collection (444 tunes) all bear the address \\"65 Berkely Street, Glasgow\\". There is a street called Berkeley Street in Glasgow. Either the spelling has changed, or Kerr didn't bother to check the spelling. The fourth collection is often believed to be from 1879 or the early 1880s. By the time he published \\"Kerr's Caledonian Collection\\" the address was changed to \\"79 Berkeley Street\\" (this time with the correct spelling), and his audience changed from the violin player to the \\"piano or piano-accordion\\" player. This reflects the new popularity of the piano accordion in Scotland in the early twentieth century. Nothing more is known of the company until they published \\"Cornkisters\\" in 1950. By this time the original Kerr must have died. Kerr Music Corporation Limited was founded in 1952. It publishes several vintage titles under the names of the original publishers: James S.

The trust operated out of Clearwater, Florida, home to Flag Land Base, Scientology's spiritual headquarters. Frequent confrontations between the LMT and Scientology began not long after the founding of the trust. Ceases criticism Minton changed his testimony in the McPherson case after a Scientology probe into his financial affairs. Minton was repeatedly ordered to attend depositions and questioned by Scientology lawyers about his alleged financial dealings. In addition, years later former church members detailed how Scientology investigated Minton, finding information he was \\"worried about\\". Critics of Scientology believe that Minton was blackmailed by the Church of Scientology. On March 16, 2002, Minton called Mike Rinder and on April 6 of that year they met. At that meeting Minton told Rinder that there were lies told in the case and he feared Scientology would uncover those lies in court and he would be sent to jail for perjury.

Dandar took the witness stand to explain the origin of Swiss bank checks totaling $750,000 that Minton allegedly gave him. Minton also testified about two financial arrangements in which $800,000 of his money was transferred from Europe to the Lisa McPherson Trust and that he had kept a portion of that money because he wanted to hide the source of the Trust's funding from the Church of Scientology.Scientology turncoat taken to task DEBORAH O'NEIL, St. Petersburg Times, Jun 13, 2002 Despite the allegations the presiding judge declined to remove attorney Dandar from the case, stating that she did not believe Minton's testimony, and that he had lied in an attempt to escape paying income taxes.Ruling lets Scientology death lawsuit proceed, St. Petersburg Times, January 14, 2003 Six months before she had already remarked that it was irrelevant how much money Minton had put into the case.

Xenutv recorded in 2000 In October 2009, Rinder and Marty Rathbun told the St. Petersburg Times that Scientology silenced Minton by digging into his financial details and secretly recording conversations. This included the Nigeria allegations in 2000. Rinder told the Times: \\"There were things that, really, he was worried about and had caused problems for him in the investigation that we had done\\" and that Minton and the church had reached a private settlement. Rinder, after leaving the church in 2007, described Minton as a friend in a 2009 interview. Death Minton died in Clonbur, Ireland of a heart ailment on January 20, 2010, at the age of 63.

City of Griffin, 303 U.S. 444 (1938), is a United States Supreme Court case.. This case was remarkable in its discussion of the requirement of persons to seek government sanction to distribute religious material. In this particular case, the Supreme Court ruled it was not constitutional for a city to require such sanction.  Background  Appellant, Alma Lovell, had been distributing literature as a Jehovah's Witness. She was arrested for this, pursuant to a Griffin, Georgia city ordinance which read, in part, that the > practice of distributing, either by hand or otherwise, circulars, handbooks, > advertising, or literature of any kind, whether said articles are being > delivered free, or whether same are being sold, within the limits of the > City of Griffin, without first obtaining written permission from the City > Manager of the City of Griffin, such practice shall be deemed a nuisance, > and punishable as an offense against the City of Griffin.Lovell, 303 U.S. at > 447. Alma Lovell did not contest the fact that she was distributing material in violation of this ordinance, but attested that the ordinance itself was unconstitutional, in that it violated her First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Lovell was convicted in the recorder's court of the City of Griffin, and sentenced to punishment of 50 days in jail, as she had not paid her fine of $50. The county court denied Lovell's appeal. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the lower court, upholding her conviction. The Supreme Court of Georgia denied an application for certiorari. Lovell appealed further, reaching the jurisdiction of the United States Supreme Court.  Opinion of the Court  Chief Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the court. Justice Cardozo did not take part in the proceedings. The Court decided that the city ordinance was unconstitutionally overbroad. Because the ordinance restricted not merely the time, place, or manner of the materials distributed, the Court believed that it was in violation of the First Amendment, and, by extension, the Fourteenth Amendment, which guaranteed that the federal constitutional guarantees would be binding on individual states. The Court reasoned that the ordinance violated the Freedom of the Press condition of the First Amendment, as the city demanded that all distributed periodicals, not merely those that were considered obscene, offensive to public morals, or which advocate unlawful conduct, obtain a license from the city before they could be distributed. The Court felt that the First Amendment was not limited to periodicals and newspapers, that it necessarily included the publication of leaflets and pamphlets as well.

Nearby are the Wenvoe Transmitter near Twyn-yr-Odyn and the site of the former HTV Wales Television Centre at Culverhouse Cross which is now a housing estate. It is home to the Wenvoe Quarry and Wenvoe Castle Golf Club. History Maintaining a thriving farming community for centuries, Wenvoe, while still a farming village to an extent, has doubled in population in the last hundred years due to new housing developments. The village originally developed around the parish church of St. Mary, which can be traced back to the twelfth century with the adjacent locality now being a conservation area. Wenvoe is recorded as having belonged to the De Sully, le Fleming and Malefaunt famililies in the later medieval periods. After being escheated to the crown the castle of Wenvoe belonged successively to the Thomas, Birt and Jenner families. Major development occurred in the 1770s but much of this was obliterated by a fire in 1910. Some medieval or earlier fortification is also known to have existed in the wooded hillside at Wrinstone.Government record of Wrinstone Castle Amenities The village has a village shop with a post office, a parish church, primary school, hotel, a part-time library, barber and three village halls. It is home to three pubs (two that have been in the village for hundreds of years ‚Äì The Wenvoe Arms and The Horse & Jockey at nearby Twyn-yr-Odyn, both of which are protected buildings ‚Äì and the more recent Walston Castle) and many acres of forestry and fields. There is another church at St Lythans. Wenvoe village The Wenvoe Arms Wenvoe has a very healthy community spirit which supports a number of local community groups. Wenvoe won 'Best Kept Village in the Vale of Glamorgan' in 2005 and again in 2007. It is served by a monthly newspaper titled the Wenvoe What's On. A village show is held every September at the Community Centre hosted by the village Scout Group. Wenvoe is a popular village as it is convenient for the city of Cardiff. Despite being a commuter village it no longer has a railway line, which was closed in the \\"Beeching Axe\\" cuts of the 1960s. The route of the old line is now heavily overgrown, grazed by farm animals and mostly inaccessible. The old railway station is now a house. Governance An electoral ward with the same name exists. This ward includes Wenvoe but stretches to the community of St Nicholas and Bonvilston. The total ward population taken at the 2011 census was 2,659. Local attractions St Lythans burial chamber The St Lythans burial chamber is 2 km (1¬º miles) west of Wenvoe, or about by road, past the village of St Lythans. It is a single stone Megalithic dolmen, built around 6,000 years ago as part of a chambered long barrow, during the Neolithic period. Tinkinswood burial chamber The Tinkinswood burial chamber is about 3.5 km (2¬Ω miles) north west of Wenvoe, near the village of St Nicholas), or about 6 km (3¬æ miles) by road towards Bonvilston. Tinkinswood is more extensive than St Lythans, which it may have once resembled, and was constructed during the same period. Between the St Lythans and Tinkinswood burial chambers lie Dyffryn Gardens, to whose estate both burial chambers once belonged.

The region makes a four directional intersection at its highway signal point on the Kochi Bypass, which leads to 1) the Vyttila Junction in the South (which further extends to the Southern regions of Kerala like Marari, Alleppey, Kollam, Trivandrum etc), 2) Kakkanad in its western direction, which is the IT hub of Kochi city, 3) the main junction of Edapally in its north end, which then diverges into the Northern and North-western regions of Kerala such as Kodangallur, Guruvayur, Thrissur, Calicut etc, and 4) eastward towards the central town area of Kochi.The junction is sometimes also referred as pipeline junction. It is a commercial area, which gained importance as a connecting point between the city's different taluks when the district's administration was moved to the nearby suburb of Kakkanad. The name Palarivattom has evolved from the name Pagalnarivattom. Pagal Nari Vattom means, a place where jackals roam even in the day time. Nowadays the region is a bustling suburb and a concrete jungle, with no jackal habitation. The State Highway SH41 Starts from Palarivattom to Thekkadi. Commerce Palarivattom's claim to fame in the early day was its vegetable and fruit markets and its close proximity to the crowded Kaloor market. It also gained fame for housing the famous Rappai Thattukada, a roadside eatery serving deep fried chicken which soon gained cult status among Malayalees in the 90s. Today, there are several IT training centres, salons, gyms, supermarkets, retail stores and boutique restaurants that have opened up on the stretch from the round junction to its signal junction. Palarivattom also houses branches of all major Indian banks including the State Bank of India, the Federal Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, and the Catholic Syrian Bank, Corporation Bank Zonal Office, and has a major telephone exchange of BSNL.

The Gombey is an iconic symbol of Bermuda, a unique performance art full of colorful and intricate masquerade, dance and drumming. This folklife tradition reflects the island's blend of African, Caribbean and British cultures. Dancers are usually male, and perform in groups of 10-30 though in modern times female groups have emerged. The traditions have been passed down orally from one generation to the next within families and the Captains of each troupe determine the direction of the troupe and style that is taught. Thus within troupes there can be found subtle but distinct differences in beats, dances, costumes, headdresses, by which they can each be recognized. History Historically, the Gombeys were not viewed as a respectable art form by the island's ruling class and were banned by the slave masters. Slaves were allowed to dance only once a year and did so in masks in order to protest, without fear of retribution, the injustices done them by their slave masters. In an article from The Royal Gazette newspaper posted on January 10, 1831, a reward is being offered for the return of two slaves by the names of Ajax and Mentor who: \\"[w]ent off without a cause at Christmas, following that Idolatrous procession the Gumba. It is hoped that this late nuisance, the Gumba and other clamorous puppet shows of the Negroes, will meet the attention of all men of reflection that they be suppressed ‚Äì as none but the worst or most ignorant Negroes follow such ridiculous shows.\\" Henceforth Gombey tradition is at its liveliest during the Christmas season, traditionally performed during Boxing Day, where the troupes would march the whole day around the island with crowds of followers. Also performances could be seen on Easter, New Year's Day, Bermuda Day and in modern times at soccer and cricket matches and other festivals and celebrations. The word \\"Gombey\\" is related to the Bahamian \\"Goombay\\", a similar musical tradition. It also refers to a specific drum of African origin (see List of Caribbean drums). In addition to the Bahamian Goombay tradition, Gombey is similar to some other Afro-Caribbean styles and celebrations (such as the Mummers). In Bermuda, Gombeys are seen more as dancers than musicians, with ritualised costumes, accoutrements and steps, whereas in the West Indies the term applies to a musical tradition, not normally accompanied by dance. Afro-Caribbeans came to Bermuda primarily from former Spanish colonies as free, but indentured, servants in the Seventeenth Century ('til the terms of indenture were raised from seven to ninety-nine years as a discouragement). Most of these arrived as Spanish-speaking Catholics, but acculturated to become English-speaking Protestants. Smaller numbers of slaves, many of African birth, were also captured from the Spanish and Portuguese and sold in Bermuda, and smaller numbers deliberately imported. Few of the British West Indian traditions we know today had evolved at that point as most of the British West Indian islands postdate Bermuda's settlement, and most of the culture of the Afro-Hispanic and African immigrants of that century, like that of the Native American and Irish sent to Bermuda under similar conditions, has been lost. Over time, the blacks, Native Americans, Irish and some of the English merged to form a single demographic, originally referred to as \\"coloured\\" (leaving Bermuda divided into two subgroups, with those presumed to be of entirely European heritage defined as \\"white\\"). In addition to the bass, or \\"Mother\\" drum, typically home-made the modern Bermudian Gombey is distinguished by the use of the snare drum (generally in pairs), derived from the British use of the instrument. In addition, a kettle drum, a fife are integral parts of Gombey accompaniment; whistles are used by leaders to issue commands. The snare drummers play complicated riffs over the steady pulse of the mother drum, often employing call and response patterns, and striking the rim of the snare, as well as the skin. The result is an exhilarating, intoxicating, rhythmic mix which provides the impulse (or impetus) for both the dancers as well as the followers, with the snare drum patterns driving the body of the movement and the rimshots communicating with the dancer's feet. Gombey's costumes cover their bodies from head to toe and are decorated with tassels, mirrors, bells, and other small items and symbols. The peacock feather headdresses, the painted masks, and the capes are distinguishing features of Gombey costumes. Many adornments of the costumes as worn today rely on modern materials or items, such as the Asian peacock feathers, that would have been hard or impossible to come by before the Twentieth Century, but there is little record of the original costume worn, so how it has changed since the Nineteenth Century can only be guessed at. There is a similarity to Native American Fancy dance costumes, which typically incorporate the feathers of native birds, so feathers less extravagant than those of the peacock may once have been a part. The Captains can be identified by their long capes and often carry a whip to control the troupe or an unruly crowd; The Bowman or Lead Indian carries a bow and arrow often going slightly ahead of the troupe to scout the way on long marches; and the Warriors carry a tomahawk (axe) which they place on their shoulder and use during cockfights when they face off against each other to display their expression of the dance. Freedom dance, junkanoo, cockfights, biblical stories, slow dance, fast dance, snake dance, and rushing back are all elements to watch for when observing a Gombey performance. Although the Gombeys have enjoyed a remarkable shift in social status, going from a marginalized group to now appearing on postage stamps and performing overseas, there are still today old laws in place that prevent Gombeys from performing in the streets of Hamilton without permits. Research and education In February 2000, the Smithsonian Institution conducted training in folklife fieldwork for Bermuda-based researchers to prepare them to survey the cultural traditions of the island. Their fieldwork, conducted from April 2000 through March 2001, became the research basis for both the Folklife Festival, the development of the Bermuda Connections Cultural Resource Guide for Classrooms, and the development of a Bermuda Folklife Officer. Dr. Richard Kurin writes in the foreword that \\"[t]his education kit grows out of Bermuda‚Äôs participation in the 2001 Smithsonian Folklife Festival. It is based on the important research that went into the Festival and the documentation that resulted from it.\\" Included in this document is a chapter on Gombeys, Bands and Troubadours. Since 2010 the entire Bermuda Connections Resource Guide has been made available for download in the Folklife section of Bermuda's Department of Community and Cultural Affairs website. Literature One of the first major literary publications on the Gombeys was a book published in 1987 by Louise A. Jackson entitled The Bermuda Gombey: Bermuda's Unique Dance Heritage. It contains pictures and sketches of Gombeys, and outlines details of history, group roles, performance and costumes. Jackson subsequently also published another book, entitled Gombey Boy, and a short narrative film on VHS. More recently a children's book called Gombey Baby was written and illustrated by Bermudian J. K. Aspinall. Film In 2008 a feature-length documentary on the Gombeys was created by the Department of Community and Cultural Affairs, Bermuda. Entitled Behind the Mask: Bermuda Gombeys Past, Present, and Future, this film captures and documents the ongoing history of the Bermuda Gombeys, highlighting their importance as one of Bermuda's oldest Folklife traditions. It premiered at the Bermuda International Film Festival in March 2008. Directed by Bermudian filmmaker Adrian Kawaley-Lathan, and co-produced with Bermudian filmmaker Kalilah Robinson, the film was created to supplement Bermuda's education system, providing much needed cultural education for adults and children alike, as well as an entertaining narrative that could be enjoyed by tourists as well as locals. Its narrative chapters were split into detailed sections covering every aspect of the Gombey culture and traditions. The DVD chapters are listed in the following order: * History * Modern Groups * Essence of Gombey * Growing up Gombey * Performance - Drums * Costumes * Performance - Roles * Training * Performance - Dance * Crowds * Community Support * Keeping the Tradition Alive * What has Changed * Unity * Future The documentary process consisted of over 30 hours of interviews and performance footage which have been preserved as digital cultural archives, in addition all the pre- existing data available on the Gombeys was amalgamated from private collections, the Bermuda Archives and Libraries into a singular resource. Primary interviews were conducted with: * Gombey historian and writer Louise A. Jackson * Tradition bearer Gary Phillips * Master Drummers Henry \\"Growther\\" Wilson and Jose \\"Boots\\" Herbert * Carnival Gombey founder John \\"Pickles\\" Spence * Costume Maker Janice Warner Tucker And the captains of each of the Gombey Troupes operating in 2008 (alphabetically): * Shaun Caisey (H&H; Gombeys) * Kevin Fubler (K&K; Gombeys) * Andre Parsons (Roots Gombeys) * Dennis Parsons & Andre Place (Place's Gombeys) * George Richardson (Richardson Gombeys) * Irwin Trott (Warwick Gombeys) * Algina Warner (Alisa Kani Girl Gombeys) * Allan Warner (Warner Gombeys). While the historical data remains accurate, changes have occurred in the modern troupes since the documentary was created. It is expected that in the future additional documentaries will be made to supersede this one, maintaining historical records of the shifting culture in Bermuda over the years. The Department of Community and Cultural Affairs remains the best source for current contacts and information on the Gombeys. A Gombey Festival is held annually to provide continued exposure to the folk art traditions of this important cultural heritage.

It was named after Harry Stansbury (died 1966), a former WVU Athletic Director. Opened in 1929 as the WVU Field House, just to the southwest of \\"Old\\" Mountaineer Field, this was the home of WVU basketball until 1970, when the WVU Coliseum was opened. This was the home floor during the days of Hot Rod Hundley and Jerry West. It hosted the Southern Conference men's basketball tournament in 1953. While the home venue of WVU basketball, the team compiled a record of 370‚Äì81 (.820) when playing there. In October 1973, it was renamed to honor Stansbury. Prior to demolition, the building war the home of the Philosophy Department, the Statistics Department, the Program for Humanities, the Program for Religious Studies, the Center for Service and Learning, and the Office of International Programs. Army and Air Force ROTC programs were also housed here. Stansbury's use prior to demolition also retained some vestige of its athletic history; the remaining arena floor was often used by intramural and \\"pickup\\" soccer and basketball games, while a gymnasium offering personal-training services was housed elsewhere in the building. On February 10, 2017, WVU announced plans to demolish Stansbury Hall and replace it with a new building for the WVU College of Business and Economics. Demolition began August 2019. The building to take its place, Reynolds Hall, is scheduled to be completed June 2022, and is going to be a new facility for WVU's John Chambers Business and Economics College.

The show was produced and funded by France 2, ARD Degeto, Canal+, Saban Entertainment and Scottish Television Enterprises, and aired in the United States on Fox Family from 1998 to 1999. In the UK the series was broadcast on CITV (via Scottish Television), and later reran on Fox Kids. Each episode consists of two shorter adventures, and a total of 52 episodes were produced. Plot Walter Melon and his assistant Bitterbug run a company as \\"heroes for hire\\". Whenever people get in trouble, go missing, or fall victim to a villains' latest scheme, Melon and Bitterbug (Lefuneste) take their places temporarily. In the show, Walter and Bitterbug replaced spoofs of characters from pop culture such as Superman, Batman, Spider-Man, Hulk, James Bond, Indiana Jones, Kirk and Spock, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo, Tarzan, Mad Max, two of the Power Rangers, Jason Lee Scott and Billy Cranston, the Terminator, Fox Mulder, John Rambo, Little Red Riding Hood, Aladdin, Pinocchio and Jiminy Cricket, Dr. Alan Grant, Marty McFly, Hercules and Casper the Friendly Ghost. Unlike most heroes, Walter is a dim-witted, overweight jolly French American time traveler with a large melon-shaped nose and a lot of luck, but nobody ever notices the apparent change in appearance, with his character's apparent weight gain merely being commented on immediately after his arrival and subsequently ignored. When he impersonates the heroes, he fights Sneero (le m√©chant), the main antagonist of the series who represents the main villain of the parody universe. Additionally, Walter is sometimes partnered with Amelia, a woman who represents the heroines, token female characters, female sidekicks, and love interests of the story. In the second season in order to make the show educational, Walter and Bitterbug would receive cross-time distress messages from historical figures such as George Washington, Christopher Columbus, Marco Polo, Thomas Edison, Lewis and Clark, Georges M√©li√®s, and the Apollo 11 astronauts, rather than fictional characters, unlike the first season. The series was available on Jetix Play, but is not currently available through any other outlet, although many of the episodes are available on YouTube to view.

Podcasts, which can include audio, video, PDF, and ePub files, are subscribed to and downloaded through web syndication or streamed online to a computer or mobile device. Subscribers are then able to view, listen to, and transfer the episodes to a variety of media players, or podcatchers. Though similar to radio, there is no larger regulatory group or oversight with podcasts. Instead, podcasts simply consist of the creators and their listeners. As the technology gained popularity in the early 2000s, the uses of podcasting grew from simply the delivery of content to also creative and responsive purposes. The uses of podcasts varies depending on the speaker, the source through which the podcast is shared, and the intended audience. Podcasts have been utilized across academia, the news cycle, entertainment, and more. Public services *Advocacy. The 5,500 locked out staff (editors, journalists, technicians, hosts, etc.) of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation were podcasting news and other programming during August and September 2005. *Law enforcement. The Chicago Police Department has a free video podcast of its half-hour weekly news magazine CrimeWatch, which airs on local TV. It documents community policing (CAPS) success stories. *News outlets distribute supplemental audio or video via podcasts. For example, Wikinews began to podcast its News Briefs in 2005. Companies also use podcasts to distribute their multimedia news to journalists and consumers through companies like MultiVu. In 2006, the online magazine Slate began textcasting articles to their readers, by attaching a written article to a blank audio file and delivering the content to readers through their regular podcasting mechanism. * Public libraries can podcast local publications free of Copyright, offering spoken word alternatives to the visually impaired. Non- profit organizations podcast readings of short-format magazine articles for visually impaired readers. * Tours ‚Äì educational Institutions use podcasts for self-guided Campus Tours. *Tours ‚Äì official cultural or historic audio tours of cities *Tours ‚Äì unofficial audio tours of museumsKennedy, Randy. 2005. \\"With Irreverence and an iPod, Recreating the Museum Tour.\\" In The New York Times, 2005-05-28. *Youth media. Podcasting has become a way for youth media organizations, such as Youth Radio, to bring youth perspectives to a wider audience. *Local community news and issues. Podcasting has emerged as an effective independent outlet to share community stories of interest and engage on-demand with citizens on local issues. Podcasting continues to be a growth medium, as 40% of Americans 12+ say they have ever listened to a podcast, while 24% say they have listened to one in the past month, up from 21% one year ago. In addition, six in ten Americans are now familiar with the term \\"podcasting,\\" a number that has risen 22% in two years. With the longer format and on-demand nature, local community podcasting allows for independent reporting accessible to a wider audience and broader demographic than traditional media channels. Education and academia =Podcasting in K-12 Education= K-12 schools have also begun adopting podcasting as an instructional tool. Podcasts are used for many educational purposes and there are several advocates of podcasting who believe that it can offer unique educational benefits to learners. The main advantage of podcasting is the simplicity that it offers to learners. Listeners are no longer constrained by time and space with regard to their learning. Podcasts give superior support to auditory learners who comprise 30% of all learners. Expensive equipment or sophisticated know-how is not needed to create a podcast. There are free programs that are easily accessible to all people to create podcasts. Podcasting affords iPods and other mobile audio players a double life: a usefulness for both entertainment and education. Podcasts are created by students for projects or by instructors for instructional purposes. Podcasts for Students There are many uses for podcasting for the classroom. They can be used to convey instructional information from the teacher or trainer, motivational stories, and auditory case studies. Podcasts can also be used by the learners as artifacts and evidence of learning; for example, a student might prepare a brief podcast as a summary of a concept in lieu of writing an essay. Podcasts can also be used as a means of self- reflection on the learning processes or products.McFadden, A. (2008). Podcasting and really simple syndication (rss). Unpublished manuscript, College of Human Environmental Sciences Institute for Interactive Technology, The University of Alabama, Alabama, mississippi. Podcasts can help keep students on the same page, including those that are absent. Absent students can use podcasts to see class lectures, daily activities, homework assignments, handouts, and more. A review of literature that reports the use of audio podcasts in K-12 and higher education found that individuals (1) use existing podcasts and/or (2) create their own podcasts.O'Bannon, B., Lubke, J., Beard, J., & Britt, V. (2011). Using podcasts to replace lecture: Effects on student achievement. Computers & Education, 1885-1892. Students can create their own podcast to share their learning experiences with each other and also with other students from other schools. According to Jonathan Copley, many students choose to use podcasts as a supplement to lecture materials. Before classes, students use podcasts to gain an overall understanding of the upcoming lecture, which makes them feel more confident and much more prepared for the class. The use of podcasts better prepares students for classes and promotes discussions. The download of podcasts peaks both immediately after a podcast has been uploaded and right before examinations or deadlines. Students use podcasts as part of their review for exams because it provides different methods of reinforcement of course material. This includes (1) visual reinforcement of material, (2) testing of their knowledge base, and (3) adding variety to the review experience. In addition, students who missed the lecture because of sickness or other reasons can use podcasts to catch up on their notes. Students learn better when they have a teacher present the materials, rather than going over other people's notes. Finally, students with disabilities and students who do not speak English as their first language use podcasts because they can listen to the material repeatedly. These students all find podcasts more useful than the traditional handouts because in a conventional classroom setting, it is impossible for students to pause and resume the class. According to Robin H. Kay, there are five key benefits regarding the use of video podcasts for students. * Students can control the pace of their own studies * Increase in motivation * Improvement in study habits * Positive impact on testing skills * Does not reduce class attendance Podcasts for Teachers Podcasting can be a tool for teachers or administrators to communicate with parents and the wider community about curriculum plans and content, student assignments and other information. =Consuming Podcasts= Apple Incorporated introduced iTunes U, a nationwide expansion of a service that puts course lectures and other educational materials online and on-the-go via Apple's iTunes software. In 2006 there were over 400 podcasts from K-12 classes listed on iTunes and over 900 education-related podcasts listed on Yahoo. Students reported that replaying podcasts facilitated the comprehension of complex concepts and increased understanding for non-native language learners. =Creating Podcasts= The use of social technologies (blogs, wikis, RSS) allow students to shift from simply consuming media to creating it on their own.McFadden, A. (2008). Podcasting and really simple syndication (rss). Unpublished manuscript, College of Human Environmental Sciences Institute for Interative Technology, The University of Alabama, Alabama, mississippi. Pundits argue that student-produced podcasting can promote several powerful ideas that students can use over a lifetime. These include a hands-on and reflective approach to copyright and fair use in creating digital media. That is, they can create original content as they ethically and effectively collect and remix the work of others. Thus, it is argued, podcasting becomes a tool for students to think about the balance between individual rights and community benefits. In addition, some argue that podcasts help students learn 21st century literacy skills. Students, for example, can use digital audio recording and editing software to create audio dramas, news shows or audio tours.Shamburg, C. (2009). Beyond podcasting:a paradigm shift. In Student- Powered Podcasting (pp. 4-12). Within Social Studies contexts, for example, podcasting offers a means for encouraging students to question their world, to explore their intuitions about relationships between history, people and to think about things in relation to larger contexts, rather than simply focus on dates and facts.Shamburg, C. (2010). DIY podcasting in education. In Knobel, M & Lankshear, C. (Eds.), DIY Media: Sharing Creating and Learning with New Media (pp.51-75). New York: Peter Lang. Educators who use podcasting with students argue that it offers learners and teachers flexibility and learner control, opportunities for learner motivation, clarity of instruction, novelty of engagement, widening of 'locations' in which learning is situated ‚Äì an expansion of the temporal and spatial, engagement with and collaboration around dialogue, and opportunities for learners to get involved in construction of learning for others. A variety of professional resources are available for teachers: *Techpod: Podcast for Teachers ‚Äì offers interviews with educators, authors, and ed techies; curriculum ideas; news resources; technology tips; and research that educators can use in the classroom. *Wikispaces: Podcasting in Education *Teaching with Podcasts - Read Write Think *K-12- Podcasts Downloads on iTunes *Web Tools 4u2use *Podstock: The Education Podcast Network =Podcasts in higher education= *Mobile Learning: Podcasting can be categorized as an m-learning strategy for teaching and learning. In 2004 Musselburgh Grammar School pioneered podcast lessons with foreign language audio revision and homework. In the second half of 2005, a Communication Studies course at the University of Western Australia used student-created podcasts as the main assessment item. In 2005 Students in the Write was created for second grade students at Morse Elementary School in Tarrytown, NY. By providing students with an authentic audience, teachers noticed significantly increased motivation to write. Students were also found to improve fluency and listening skills. On 21 February 2006, Lance Anderson (Verge of the Fringe), Dr. Chris Smith (the Naked Scientist), Nigel Paice and Debbie McGowan took part in the first podcast forum at Cambridge University. The event was hosted by the Centre for Applied Research in Educational Technologies. * Mobile Knowledge Transfer: Podcasting is also used by corporations to disseminate information faster and more easily. It can be seen as a further development of Rapid E-Learning as the content can be created fast and without much effort. Learners can learn in idle times which saves time and money for them and the organizations. Audio podcasts can be used during other activities like driving a car, or traveling by train/bus. A group often targeted is the salesforce, as they are highly mobile. There podcasting can be used for sales enablementhttp://www.podcastmaschine.de/wordpress/?p=33 with the goal of having the sales employee aware and knowledgeable on the companies products, processes, initiatives etc. An often-used format is expert interviews with statements of experienced role models to bring across also informal/tacit knowledge. *Language Learning: Podcasts can be used to both inside and outside the language learning classroom. Teachers can record and publish their daily lessons for students to download to their MP3 players for endless practice. There are also predesigned websites where native speakers publish stories and language learners can respond via a comment function. This combines the use of podcast with blogs. *Mathematical Learning: Audio-podcasts can also be used in mathematics education. With the recording of mathematical audio-podcasts, oral communication and representation are focussed on. Audio- podcasts have been used in primary schoolKlose, R. & Schreiber, Chr. (2013). PriMaPodcast - A tool for vocal representation. In SEMT Proceedings 2013. as well as in teacher education. The process of producing the mentioned audio- podcasts in mathematics education facilitates reflection processes. *Journalism Education: School podcasts can be created to expose students to journalism and new-media concepts. Regularly released \\"news\\" podcasts can be released by a school group.Richardson, W. (2006). Blogs, Wikis, Podcasts and the Powerful Web Tools for Classrooms. Thousand Oaks: Corwin Press. *Academic Journal Digests: The Society of Critical Care Medicine has a podcast used to update clinicians with summaries of important articles, as well as interviews. *Supply Chain Management Education: In October 2007, Stephan Brady presented his paper on \\"Podcasting in Supply Chain Education\\" at the CSCMP Educators Conference, which outlined how podcasting could be used in and outside of the classroom for enhancing supply chain courses through blended, or hybrid learning.http://sctoday.net/ProfessorNotes/wordpress/wp- content/uploads/2007/10/Proceedings_Podcasting.pdf *Professional Development: Professional development podcasts exist for educators. Some podcasts may be general in nature or may be slightly more specific and focus on the use of interactive white boards in the classroom. *Religion: Godcasting has been used by many religious groups.Heinen, Tom. 2005. \\"Podcasting becomes another pulpit.\\" In JS Online, 2005-06-11. Many churches produce podcasts of talks and sermons. Disciples with Microphones provides podcasts relating to the Catholic Church.Disciples with Microphones * Tutorials: A tutorial on almost any subject can be created as either an audio podcast or video vodcast. Through screencasting, many video podcasts demonstrate how to use software and operating systems. * Anxiety: Podcasts have been used to solve problems with college students‚Äô anxiety by allowing professors‚Äô lectures to be accessed after class so the students would not have to worry about missing any of the material if absent or tardy. According to Anthony Chan & Mark J.W. Lee, \\"The advent of consumer-level digital multimedia hardware and software have prompted the more techno-logically inclined instructors and educational designers to construct CD-ROM based re-sources to engage and excite students using the richness and flexibility of text, graphics, sound, video, animation and interactive content, as well as the combination of these elements\\". Entertainment *Comedy. Comedians such as Ricky Gervais, Stephen Fry, Adam Carolla and Marc Maron have created some of the most popular podgrams. *True Crime. The popularity of Serial in 2014 led to an increase in true crime podcasts ranging from deep dives into cold cases by traditional news sources to comedic looks at famous true crime stories. *Television commentary. Battlestar Galactica writer and executive producer Ronald D. Moore creates commentary podcasts for each new episode of Battlestar Galactica. Other television shows such as Doctor Who, The Good Place, and The Daily Show have since followed suit. Netflix launched a podcast in 2018 dedicated to the discussion of its own programming. *Radio series. Some radio programmes such as The Now Show and The News Quiz allow entire episodes to be downloaded as podcasts. * Film commentary (Audio commentary). Enables fans to add their own comments and thoughts to any of their favourite films. *Sports. In 2005, unofficial podcasts for major sports teams launched, providing fans both in and outside of the teams' direct broadcast areas with on-demand commentary. The Cubscast founders also formed the first city-specific sports podcast network, hosting one podcast for each major Chicago team. Networks such as ESPN and The Ringer (website) consist of podcasts dedicated to a specific sport or general commentary. *Reintroducing Classical Children's Literature. Podcasts such as Albert Lea Public Library's Classics On-the-Go program bring classical (noncopyrighted) children's literature back to life for everyone to share. *Fiction. Narrative podcasting has also gained in popularity with programs such as Welcome to Night Vale and Limetown. Fiction podcasts can feature a single narrator, similar to an audiobook, or a full cast of characters with environmental sounds and music. Podcasts like Escape Pod are used to distribute short stories in audiobook format. Other podcasts distribute stories in the format of radio drama. News *Newspapers. Newspapers use podcasts to broadcast audio content from print interviews and drive traffic to their websites. The San Francisco Chronicle is believed to be the first major daily newspaper to start podcasting using an external website,San Francisco Chronicle Podcast. in Feb 2005. Hong Kong's South China Morning Post was the first to use its own website and the first in Asia, having launched on April 19, 2005South China Morning Post Podcast. The adoption of podcast for news distribution has been more widely used these days, given that major news media such as The New York Times and CNN have adopted them as part of their services. *Communication from space. *Conference and meeting alerts. Podcasts can be packaged to alert attendees to agendas, hosted round-tables and daily feedback. Marketing * Podcasting can be used as a part of a content marketing strategy. Podcasts create brand fanatics, people who are deeply invested in who podcasters are as people and as business professionals. This is the essence of long-form content marketing. Every minute that a customer or prospect listens to a podcaster speak with authority the podcaster is establishing themselves as a thought-leader. Conceptually the more time an audience spends with the podcasters content the more authority the podcaster will acquire. Music * Replacement for live music audio streams. Whereas streaming a performance live over the Internet requires careful coordination of person and machine, podcasting offers the ability to do slight time-shifting of performances and greatly reduces the complexity of the effort. The quality of the program is often higher as post-production adjustments can be made prior to release. For example, programs can provide a live stream of their program, but most listeners don't hear it until weeks later on NPR. Podcasted versions of the programs split the difference, usually coming out a few days after the live program, but well before the traditional broadcast. Politics *In the U.S., both major political parties have various podcasts, as do numerous politicians. One popular podcast is the White House RSS feed that provides the public with President Weekly Addresses, White House Speeches, White House Press Briefings and White House features. Several other political personalities have also had podcasts that explore political themes, such as Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, and famous actor, comedian and activist Russell Brand. *Many have found podcasts to be a great forum for social and political commentary. Many large news outlets have started podcasts in recent years, including the Spectator, the Atlantic and BBC. *Crooked Media is a podcast network completely devoted to political commentary, while other networks, such as NPR and Slate (magazine), feature individual political programs in their lineup. Publicity and marketing * As a promotional vehicle for an upcoming event, such as Pixar's Cars Video Podcast, which advertised the release of Disney/Pixar's Cars animated feature film with a series of behind-the-scenes clips. ; podcasting have been successful with reaching out to people who are out on the road through podcasts and that this more than an either/or kind of idea or decision, yet a coexisting strategy combining many different online marketing strategies like blogs e-books, and good websites\\". This shows that even podcasts do get hit with legal constraints, but can find ways around it due their lack of affiliation with the FCC. They essentially bypass the entire industry. Health * Health and wellness education are widely accessible to the public through podcasts. Many developed countries such as Australia have utilised podcasts to publish new findings in the medical field. The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) has been one of the active participants in informing the public of new drugs and processes to improve medical awareness. Special interests * Farm Podcasting makes information available about farming. The term was coined to identify a program that is produced exclusively as a podcast on the subject of agriculture. There are now multiple companies who specialize in farm podcasting, producing regular programming on agriculture targeted to farmers and the general public. Non-traditional and alternative content *A way for people and organizations to avoid regulatory bodies, such as the British Ofcom or American Federal Communications Commission (FCC), that would not allow a program to be broadcast in traditional media.

The club was founded in July 2003, when the businessman Phindani Nene acquired the Castle League franchise of the National First Division club Moja United from Pietermaritzburg, and thereby established his new club Durban Stars FC, directly into the second level of South African football. The club played at that level from 2003‚Äì09, before being relegated to Vodacom League. At the subsequent 2009‚Äì10 season, the club got relegated to the fourth level, known as the SAB Regional League, after having received no less than 14 \\"disciplinary 0‚Äì2 defeats\\" from SAFA. Presumably, the disciplinary irregularity arose from the fact that the team had fielded ineligible players during almost half of the matches in the season. To avoid the relegation for the fourth level, the club decided to buy the Castle League franchise of Globe City in Vodacom League. In the 2010‚Äì11 season, the newly reinforced Durban Stars won the KwaZulu-Natal division of Vodacom League. In June 2011, they participated in the Vodacom League playoffs, competing for a promotion back to the National First Division. Durban Stars company and affiliations The company Durban Stars is based in the La-Lucia suburb of Durban, and handles events and marketing across South Africa. Durban Stars Sports and Marketing is a subdivision of Durban Stars, that specialises in Sports Development, Sports Events, Branding, Digital Advertising and Sports Sponsorship and Sales. Among the customers of the services provided by Durban Stars are: MTN Group, Nedbank, SuperSport, SABC, Ethekwini Municipality and KwaZulu-Natal provincial government. As of 2008, the annual events organised by Durban Stars include: Varsity Cup, Mini Soccer World Cup, MTN Top 32 Schools Soccer Tournament, and Durban Summer Splash. The company also opted to establish the Durban Stars Sporting Club as a subdivision, to develop sporting clubs within several sports disciplines. As of 2008, they have created professional teams within Beach soccer, BMX, Skateboarding, Touch rugby, Beach cricket, Basketball, Volleyball and Indigenous Games. Club records and best achievements * Won the silver medal of the National First Division in 2004‚Äì05. * Reached the 1/8-Finals (round 16) of the 2004 ABSA cup. * Highest scored point average, 2.33 points per match, was achieved when the club won the KwaZulu-Natal province of Vodacom League in 2010‚Äì11. =Historical League results= *2003‚Äì04 (NFD) ‚Äì 3rd (in Coastal stream) *2004‚Äì05 (NFD) ‚Äì 2nd *2005‚Äì06 (NFD) ‚Äì 10th *2006‚Äì07 (NFD) ‚Äì 7th *2007‚Äì08 (NFD) ‚Äì 6th (in Coastal stream) *2008‚Äì09 (NFD) ‚Äì 8th (in Coastal stream => Relegated) *2009‚Äì10 (VL) ‚Äì 16th (in Kwazulu- Natal) *2010‚Äì11 (VL) ‚Äì 1st (in Kwazulu-Natal) Team squad in 2010‚Äì11 The list below highlight the team's most valuable players as of May 2011, according to the South African soccer site KickOff.

Before 1974, Salt Hill was part of Buckinghamshire. It is to the north of Chalvey and the Great West Road, surrounding Salt Hill Park. The name Salt Hill is derived from Montem Mound in Chalvey, which was also known as Salt Hill, or Salts Hill. In 1807, the French nobleman Antoine Philippe, Duke of Montpensier died here of tuberculosis on the way from London to Devon. On 1 January 1845, John Tawell, who had recently returned from Australia, murdered his lover, Sarah Hart, at Salt Hill by poisoning her with prussic acid. With various officials in chase, Tawell fled to Slough railway station and boarded a train to Paddington. The electrical telegraph had recently been installed and so a message was sent ahead to Paddington with Tawell's details. Tawell was trailed and subsequently arrested, tried and executed for the murder at Aylesbury on 28 March 1845. This is believed to be the first time ever that the telegraph had been involved in the apprehension of a murderer. On 6 February 1870 William MacBean George Colebrooke K.B. died at his home here. He, along with fellow Utilitarian Charles Hay Cameron had been responsible for the Colebrooke-Cameron Commission report, which brought constitutional government to Ceylon (later Sri Lanka)in 1870 There was no country called Sri Lanki, this did not happen until after independenceSri Lanka and marks the beginning of the modern era in that country.

MR is a receptor with equal affinity for mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. It belongs to the nuclear receptor family where the ligand diffuses into cells, interacts with the receptor and results in a signal transduction affecting specific gene expression in the nucleus.  Function  MR is expressed in many tissues, such as the kidney, colon, heart, central nervous system (hippocampus), brown adipose tissue and sweat glands. In epithelial tissues, its activation leads to the expression of proteins regulating ionic and water transports (mainly the epithelial sodium channel or ENaC, Na+/K+ pump, serum and glucocorticoid induced kinase or SGK1) resulting in the reabsorption of sodium, and as a consequence an increase in extracellular volume, increase in blood pressure, and an excretion of potassium to maintain a normal salt concentration in the body. The receptor is activated by mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone and its precursor deoxycorticosterone as well as glucocorticoids, like cortisol. In intact animals, the mineralocorticoid receptor is \\"protected\\" from glucocorticoids by co-localization of an enzyme, corticosteroid 11-beta-dehydrogenase isozyme 2 (a.k.a. 11Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2; 11Œ≤-HSD2), that converts cortisol to inactive cortisone. It also responds to some progestins. Spironolactone and eplerenone are steroidal MR antagonists of the spirolactone group. Activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor, upon the binding of its ligand aldosterone, results in its translocation to the cell nucleus, homodimerization and binding to hormone response elements present in the promoter of some genes. This results in the complex recruitment of the transcriptional machinery and the transcription into mRNA of the DNA sequence of the activated genes. An activating mutation in the NR3C2 gene (S810L) results in constitutive activity of the mineralocorticoid receptor, leading to severe early-onset hypertension that is exacerbated by pregnancy. In a family known to harbor the S810L mutation, 3 individuals carrying the mutation died of chronic heart failure before age 50. Additional studies have shown that this activated version of MR can positively respond to ligands that are traditionally antagonists, such as endogenous hormones like progesterone, and the diuretic drugs spironolactone and eplerenone. Currently, the non-steroidal anti-mineralocorticoid drug Finerenone (Bayer) is in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of chronic heart failure.

Phoradendron macrophylla in Arizona sycamoreMultiple Phoradendron individuals parasitizing an oak tree. While lower branches show new leaf growth, the mistletoe appears to be negatively affecting the tree's budding in the upper branches. Phoradendron californicum (Desert Mistletoe), Granite Mountains, Mojave Desert, California Phoradendron is a genus of mistletoe, native to warm temperate and tropical regions of the Americas. The center of diversity is the Amazon rainforest.Coder, K. D. American mistletoe (Phoradendron serotinum var. serotinum) infection in trees. WSFNR08-25. Tree Health Series. University of Georgia. 2008. Phoradendron is the largest genus of mistletoe in the Americas, and possibly the largest genus of mistletoes in the world. Traditionally, the genus has been placed in the family Viscaceae, but recent genetic research acknowledged by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group shows this family to be correctly placed within a larger circumscription of the sandalwood family, Santalaceae. They are woody hemi- parasitic shrubs with branches long, which grow on other trees. The foliage is dichotomously branching, with opposite pairs of leaves; these are fairly large, long, green and photosynthetic in some species (e.g. P. leucarpum), but minimal in some others (e.g. P. californicum). Although they are able to photosynthesize the plant relies on its host for some nutrients. The plant draws its mineral and water needs, and some of its energy needs, from the host tree using a haustorium which grows into the stems of the host.Hiller, J. B. (2010). Marvelling at mistletoe. Highlights for Children. 65(12) 40-41. The flowers are inconspicuous and incomplete, no petals and 3-4 greenish-yellow sepals, diameter. The fruit is a berry, white, yellow, orange, or red when mature, containing one to several seeds embedded in very sticky juice, called viscin. The flowers are unisexual, and depending on the species, the plant will be monoecious or dioecious (both male and female flowers on a single plant or male and female plants with only one sex of flowers). The seeds are dispersed when birds eat the fruit and remove the sticky seeds from their bills by wiping them on tree branches where they can germinate. The foliage and berries of some species are toxic. Leafy mistletoes seldom kill but they cause stress reducing crop productions in fruits and nut trees.Krautwurst, T. (2003) The truth about mistletoe. Mother Earth News 195 26-29. Phoradendron plants can be distinguished from mistletoes in other genera in Viscaceae by their inflorescences, which lack leaves and come from a single branching point or apical meristem. However, it can be difficult to identify species within Phoradendron, because leaf shape and color can vary greatly even within species. Phoradendron sp. on Spanish oak Host and symptoms Phoradendron species can infest many taxa of plants including hackberry (Celtis spp.) mesquite (Prosopsis spp.), cedar, elm (Ulmus spp.), and Osage-orange.Turner, M. W. Remarkable Plants of Texas: Uncommon Accounts of our Common Natives. University of Texas Press. 2009. pg. 261. Certain species of Phoradendron are host-specific; for example, in Arizona, Phoradendron tomentosum infests cottonwood (Populus fremontii), sycamore (Platanus wrightii), ash (Fraxinus spp.), walnut (Juglans spp.) and willow (Salix spp.).Geils, B. W., et al. Mistletoes of North American conifers. Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-98. Ogden, Utah: USDA, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station. 2002. P. californicum infests shrubs and trees such as acacia (Acacia spp.) and blue palo verde (Parkinsonia florida). Some species infest junipers (Juniperus spp.) and oaks (Quercus spp.).Hine, R. Diseases of Urban Plants. Adapted by M. Olsen. Plant Disease Publications. University of Arizona Cooperative Extension. Revised 1999. Branches often become swollen and distorted, forming burls and making the tree more susceptible to insect attack. Phoradendron presents serious problems along rivers, streams, parks, and golf courses with large cottonwood trees. Deciduous trees can be mistaken for evergreens during the winter if infection is heavy. Other common symptoms include swelling formations of witch's broom, dieback, and weakened branches.Call, R. E. Mistletoe. Home Horticulture. University of Arizona Cooperative Extension, Cochise County. Life cycle Phoradendron species are hemiparasites which produce their own chlorophyll but rely on the host plant to provide water, minerals, and other nutrients.Watson, W. T. and T. Martinez-Trinidad. (2006). Strategies and treatments for leafy mistletoe (Phoradendron tomentosum (DC.) Engelm ex. Gray) suppression on cedar elm (Ulmus crassifolia Nutt.). Arboriculture and Urban Forestry 32(6) 265-70. Birds are the primary means of dispersal of the parasite.Aukema, J. E. (2004). Distribution and dispersal of desert mistletoe is scale-dependent, hierarchically nested. Ecography 27 137-44. Birds consume the drupes of the mistletoe and excrete or regurgitate the seeds onto the branches of the host plant. The seeds do not need to be ingested to germinate. Germinating seeds produce a radicle, a holdfast, and eventually the germinated seeds produce haustoria. The haustorium is a root-like structure that penetrates the host plant's bark and cambium, reaching the xylem and phloem where it extracts water and minerals, primarily carbon and nitrogen compounds. A study on the nutrient ratio between Phoradendron and their hosts found that the parasite have higher concentrations of nitrogen and minerals, especially in leguminous hosts. This suggests that the parasite actively draws nutrients from the host plant through both the xylem and phloem, challenging the alternative theory of the passive uptake of nutrients by the parasite from the host xylem only. The most important birds for effective dispersal include the cedar waxwing, euphonias, silky-flycatchers, bluebirds, and thrushes. Phoradendron caripense Management Leafy mistletoe can adversely affect trees growing in urban environments and in forests. It is considered a nuisance in urban environments because of its appearance on deciduous trees during winter. Severe colonization of mistletoe can affect the health of an individual tree, and a tree already stressed by other factors can be killed. Forest fragmentation can increase Phoradendron infection rates in some oak trees, as trees in lower density forests and those closer to the forests' edges are more likely to be colonized by the mistletoe. Control and management regimes include watering the host plant to improve its vigor, and removing infested vegetation. Pruning infested branches is not generally effective because the haustoria can infiltrate deeply. Plucking the mistletoe herbage is a temporary treatment because it easily resprouts, but keeping its herbage sparse can help to reduce its seed production. Wildlife & human uses Phorodendron species are larval host plants for a number of Lepidoptera. The buckthorn duskywing (Erynnis pacuvius) feeds on Phoradendron californicum.Soule, J. A. Butterfly Gardening in Southern Arizona. Tierra del Sol Institute. Tucson, Arizona. 2012. Phoradendron are the preferred food of the Phainopepla, a silky-flycatcher. The male defends territories where fruiting mistletoe is abundant.Soule, J. A. Father Kino's Herbs: Growing Them & Using Them Today. Tierra del Sol Institute. Tucson, Arizona. 2010. There may actually be some mutualistic interactions between the parasite and the host in some Phoradendron species. The presence of Phoradendron juniperinum on host Juniperus monosperma, for example, has been suggested to increase dispersal of the host's seeds by birds. The mistletoe berries may attract frugivorous birds (e.g. thrushes) to eat the host juniper's seeds and disperse them. The net benefit on the hosts is difficult to quantify, however. The birds dispersing the host's seeds and benefiting the host, while at the same time dispersing the mistletoe's seeds and spreading the Phoradendron infection. Phoradendron californicum was used by Native American peoples as a food and medicinal remedy.Phoradendron californicum. Native American Ethnobotany. University of Michigan, Dearborn. Some Phoradendron species, such as Phoradendron serotinum and Phoradendron flavescens, are used in North America as Christmas decoration, substituting for the European mistletoe Viscum album.Solomon, J.

The Ministry was established with a mandate to reform the investment climate in Egypt, further develop non-bank financial services, and introduce a comprehensive Asset Management Program to State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs). He led a comprehensive structural and regulatory reform program to modernize and liberalize the Egyptian economy in those three critical areas - leveraging private investment for growth and job creation; enhancing access to non-bank financial services; and implementing a successful asset management program of public enterprises. Private investment: through his major legislative and institutional reforms, there was tangible impact on both domestic investments, as well as FDI inflows. Between 2004/05 and 2006/07, private sector investments grew at an average annual rate of 40% and FDI inflows increased from $2 billion in 2004 50 $13.2 billion in 2008. As a result of his leadership, Egypt was named Top Reformer for four years in the Doing Business Report and was top regional recipient of foreign direct investment. Financial services and corporate governance: Dr. Mohieldin has established a global reputation for effective and strategic management and built an outstanding record of results including: creating an effective single regulator for the non-bank financial sector, the Egyptian Financial Supervisory Authority (EFSA); building a stock-market for small and medium- sized enterprises, the Nile Stock Exchange (NILEX); creating the first Institute of Directors in the Arab World; developing an environmental, social and governance index with Standard & Poor's for companies listed on the Egyptian Exchange (S&P;/EGX ESG Index); developing the first Arabic Code of Conduct for corporate governance and introducing guidelines for corporate social responsibility; consolidating and liberalizing the insurance sector and enhancing its regulatory framework; and developing the mortgage finance market and launching Egypt's first liquidity facility for mortgage refinance. These regulatory reform measures helped allow the non-bank financial services industry to accommodate new products as well as position Egypt as the regional center for financial services at the time. Asset Management Program: By adopting a comprehensive asset management program, the Ministry of Investment, under the leadership of Dr. Mohieldin, eliminated the 32 million pound debt of State-Owned Enterprises, and brought it to zero; its net assets went from negative to positive. By 2007/08, the portfolio was generating profit of 5.1 billion Egyptian pounds. The Ministry also significantly enhanced corporate governance of SOEs.

Located at the southwest of Penang Island, it is also the administrative seat of the Southwest Penang Island District. The agricultural town of Balik Pulau was established in 1794 by the British East India Company. To this day, the economy of Balik Pulau still relies heavily on agriculture; Penang's most famous produce, including nutmegs, cloves and durians, are grown and harvested in the town. These have also contributed to the town's growing tourism sector; Balik Pulau's reputation for its wide variety of durians, for instance, attracts hordes of tourists between May and August each year. While Balik Pulau, and by extension, the western part of Penang Island, is generally seen as quieter in comparison to the bustling city centre on the other side of the island, urbanisation has also reached the town in recent years, with more residential developments being planned for this part of Penang Island.  Etymology  Balik Pulau means 'the back of the island' in Malay. It refers to the town's location at the western side of Penang Island, geographically separated from George Town to the northeast by the island's central hills.  History  A gallery of images depicting the various cultural processions in Balik Pulau in the 1930s.left The first clove and nutmeg plantations in Balik Pulau were set up by the British East India Company in 1794. During the early years of Company rule on Penang Island (then the Prince of Wales Island), spice cultivation was encouraged as a means to cover the administrative costs of the island. The British also intended to turn the Prince of Wales Island into a centre for spice production in Southeast Asia in order to break the Dutch monopoly of the spice trade at the time. During the first half of the 19th century, the clove and nutmeg farms of Balik Pulau attracted Malay refugees fleeing the Siamese invasion of Kedah, as well as Chinese immigrants who were then employed at the farms. The town centre, also known colloquially as 'Kongsi' (meaning 'to share' in Malay), was apparently named after the communal wooden longhouses that once existed within the heart of Balik Pulau. Residents of various ethnicities, who worked at the plantations surrounding Balik Pulau, resided in these longhouses, hence the name. The town centre soon grew, with the addition of banks, schools, shops and a colonial fountain, which was erected in the late 19th century by a local Chinese businessman, Koh Seang Tat. For much of its history, Balik Pulau has been a rather quiet agricultural town, in stark contrast to the busier eastern side of Penang Island where the capital city, George Town, is situated. As agriculture does not feature prominently in Penang's economy, Balik Pulau is said to have the last remaining paddy fields in all of Penang Island. On the other hand, the spillover of urbanisation from the eastern seaboard of Penang Island is also gathering pace in Balik Pulau, with residential properties are being planned for the town in recent years.  Governance  The Southwest Penang Island District and Land Office in Balik Pulau. Balik Pulau serves as the seat of the Southwest Penang Island District, as the district's Land Office is situated within the town. Moreover, the town is also home to the district's Magistrates Court. However, as with the rest of Penang Island, Balik Pulau falls under the jurisdiction of the Penang Island City Council, which is based in George Town.  Demographics  According to most definitions, the town of Balik Pulau encompasses several mukims, namely Bagan Ayer Itam, Titi Teras, Kongsi, Kampong Paya, Sungai Burong, Pulau Betong, Dataran Ginting, Batu Itam, Bukit Balik Pulau and Pondok Upeh. Based on the 2010 National Census conducted by Malaysia's Department of Statistics, these mukims cumulatively contained a population of 23,559. Ethnic Malays formed almost of Balik Pulau's population. The Chinese made up nearly of the population, followed by the Indians at over 3%.  Transportation  Balik Pulau Bus Terminal Balik Pulau is served by three major roads which intersect within the town centre. Jalan Balik Pulau connects the town with the fishing village of Gertak Sanggul near the southwestern tip of Penang Island. As the road is also part of the pan-island Federal Route 6 which loops around Penang Island, it also links Balik Pulau with the other major urban centres on the island. The eastbound Jalan Tun Sardon stretches through the island's central hills, providing a more direct link towards Paya Terubong and Bukit Jambul, while the north-bound Jalan Sungai Pinang leads towards Teluk Bahang near the northwestern tip of Penang Island. In addition, six Rapid Penang bus routes include stops within Balik Pulau - 401, 401E, 403, 404, 501 and 502. These bus routes link Balik Pulau with George Town, the Penang International Airport, Queensbay Mall, Bayan Baru and Teluk Bahang. Aside from these routes, in 2018, Rapid Penang launched a free-of-charge transit service within Balik Pulau, known as the Congestion Alleviation Transport (CAT).

Run by Malaysia's Ministry of Health, it is one of the six public hospitals within the State of Penang. The hospital is equipped with 71 beds and provides, among others, haemodialysis, emergency and infectious disease control services.  Tourist attractions  left Balik Pulau's attractions are more agricultural, alluding to the huge role agriculture has played in the town's economy and its laid-back pace of life. The town is famous for some of Penang's most well-known products - nutmegs, durians and cloves. In recent years, agricultural tourism is booming in Balik Pulau, as tourists from other states and abroad flock to the town to sample fresh durians and nutmegs. For instance, Balik Pulau's durian orchards, which produce a wide variety of durian cultivars, are best visited during the durian harvesting season between May and August each year. Balik Pulau's nutmeg farms and shops also offer samples of nutmeg fruits and products, including nutmeg juice.

Located at the northern bank of the Kerian River in South Seberang Perai District, it is the southernmost populated place of Penang. Nibong Tebal contained a population of 2,045 . Founded as an agricultural village, Nibong Tebal now houses light industries as well, including one of Malaysia's largest manufacturers of paper products. It also the headquarters of the Malaysian pulp and paper company, Nibong Tebal Paper Mill.  History  A boat in Nibong Tebal in the 1900s Nibong Tebal had been in existence since the early 19th century as an agricultural village. Sugar harvesting formed the mainstay of Nibong Tebal's economy during its early years; the industry was dominated by the Europeans due to their technological superiority. By the mid-19th century, Penang Sugar Estates Limited, which was based in Nibong Tebal, became the largest producer of sugar within Province Wellesley (now Seberang Perai). Upon the death of its owner, Edward Horsman, the Ramsden family, one of Britain's richest families, acquired the company. European influence in Nibong Tebal soon permeated into the area's social fabric, with the arrival of Catholic missionaries in the late 19th century. By then, Nibong Tebal had attracted significant numbers of Chinese immigrants. A Taoist temple had been built in the area in 1866. Nibong Tebal also became a stronghold of the Ghee Hin Kongsi, one of the active Chinese secret societies in Penang at the time. In 1900, the nascent railway line between Perai and Bukit Mertajam was extended to Nibong Tebal, and by 1902, the railroad was joined to Perak's new railway line as well. This boosted Nibong Tebal's new role as a transportation hub, a role which was maintained until the 1930s. The completion of a road bridge across the Kerian River led to Nibong Tebal's decline as a transportation hub.  Demographics  , Nibong Tebal had a population of 2,045. Ethnic Chinese accounted for more than 70% of the population, followed by the Indians at nearly 19% and the Malays at 7%.  Transportation  The Federal Route 1, a major trunk road along western Peninsular Malaysia, runs through the heart of Nibong Tebal. It stretches across the Kerian River and is connected to Jalan Transkrian, which leads to the neighbourhood of Transkerian to the south. The Nibong Tebal railway station is one of the stops along the Malayan Railway's Electric Train Service route along western Peninsular Malaysia.

It is located within the Southwest Penang Island District, near the southeastern tip of Penang Island. Founded in the 19th century, Bayan Lepas is now home to the Penang International Airport and an eponymous Free Industrial Zone, dubbed the Silicon Valley of the East due to its size. Various multinational electronic and engineering firms, including Bosch, Motorola, Dell, Intel and Hewlett- Packard, have set up factories and assembly plants within the town. According to urban legend, Bayan Lepas was founded in the late 19th century by a family from Sumatra. The Penang International Airport, the first civilian airport to be built in British Malaya, was opened in 1935. For much of the town's history, it was an agricultural area, with rice farming a major source of income. In the 1970s, the Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone was created, ushering in the rapid development of the town. Bayan Lepas proper is surrounded by residential townships such as Bayan Baru and Sungai Ara to the north, and Batu Maung to the southeast.  History  The 'old town' of Bayan Lepas is situated at the southeastern tip of Penang Island. Free Industrial Zone in the 1970s. Bayan Lepas was believed to have been named after a wealthy Sumatran family who founded the town in the late 19th century. Upon coming ashore, their pet parakeet escaped, hence the name Bayan Lepas, which meant 'escaped parakeet' in Malay. The heart of Bayan Lepas, also known as the 'old town' by the locals, is located at the intersection of Jalan Bayan Lepas and Jalan Dato Ismail Hashim, to the west of the Penang International Airport. As the town grew modestly in the early 20th century, amenities, such as a wet market and a police station, were built within the town centre by the British. In 1935, the Bayan Lepas Airport was opened by the Straits Settlements authorities. It was the first civilian airport ever built within British Malaya. The airport was eventually expanded and upgraded into the Penang International Airport in 1979. The British also built a fortification at nearby Batu Maung to defend Penang Island and the RAF Butterworth Air Base on the mainland against amphibious invasion. However, the fort was abandoned ahead of the advancing Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. Up until the 1970s, Bayan Lepas was a relatively rural village, where rice farming was the main economic activity. As a result, the town was once known as the 'rice bowl' of Penang. In 1972, the then Chief Minister of Penang, Lim Chong Eu, opened the Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone to alleviate an economic crisis and rising unemployment that plagued Penang at the time. Pioneer tax status was granted to multinational firms seeking to establish factories and assembly plants in Bayan Lepas. Complemented by low-cost labour, the creation of the Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone was successful in reversing Penang's economic slump, while the industrial zone itself grew to become the 'Silicon Valley of the East'. The industrialisation of Bayan Lepas in the 1970s also resulted in the rapid development of the town in the following decades, as residential townships like Bayan Baru were built and expanded around Bayan Lepas. This has led to the urbanisation of the entire eastern coast of Penang Island, as residential developments emanating north from Bayan Lepas merged with the suburbs of George Town, such as Gelugor. Further development was spurred on by the completion of the Penang Bridge and the Second Penang Bridge.  Demographics  The mukim of Bayan Lepas includes not only the town of Bayan Lepas itself, it also encompasses the surrounding neighbourhoods such as Batu Maung, Bayan Baru and Sungai Ara. According to the 2010 National Census conducted by Malaysia's Department of Statistics, the mukim of Bayan Lepas had a population of 122,654. Thus, Bayan Lepas is the largest town within the Southwest Penang Island District, containing the majority of the district's population. Ethnic Malays formed over 47% of Bayan Lepas's population, followed by the Chinese at 37% and the Indians at nearly 8%. Notably, foreigners comprised almost 7% of the population.  Economy  Aerial view of the Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone = Manufacturing = The manufacturing sector, particularly in the electronics and engineering sectors, has been the mainstay of Bayan Lepas's economy. Since its inception in the 1970s, the Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone has grown to become the 'Silicon Valley of the East'. Motorola became one of the first multinational firms to set up a factory within the zone, followed by several other firms, such as Intel, AMD, Osram, Hewlett Packard, Bosch, Hitachi, Dell, Intel and Clarion.http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/gep/documents/conferences/2012/malaysia- conference/prema-chandra-athukorala.pdf Due to the presence of multinational firms in Bayan Lepas, the town has received enormous amounts of foreign direct investment (FDI). As of 2015, Penang attracted nearly RM4.5 billion worth of foreign direct investment (FDI), the largest amount in Malaysia, with significant investments going to the manufacturing sector. In addition, the Free Industrial Zone has helped propel the manufacturing sector to become one of the major contributors to Penang's economy, generating as much as 44.6% of Penang's total Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2016. = Service outsourcing = In recent years, the Penang state government has allocated investments towards the development of the Bayan Baru township into a Business Processing Outsourcing (BPO) hub. These investments include the construction of Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC)-status infrastructure, such as SUNTECH Tower and One Precinct. A number of multinational firms, including Celestica, Keyence and Zurich Insurance, have already set up business outsourcing centres within the area as well. = Agriculture = Fishing boats moored along Kluang River The adjacent neighbourhood of Batu Maung is home to an active fisheries industry. It contains a deepwater fishing port, as well as the headquarters of WorldFish Center, an international, non-profit fisheries research organisation, and the Fisheries Research Institute of Malaysia's Fisheries Development Authority.  Transportation  = Air = The Penang International Airport is one of the busiest airports in Malaysia, with frequent connections to major Asian cities. The Penang International Airport in Bayan Lepas is one of the busiest airports in Malaysia and serves as the major airport within the northern region of Peninsular Malaysia. Completed in 1935 when Penang was part of the British crown colony of the Straits Settlements, it is also the oldest civilian airport in the nation. The airport's proximity to the Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone allows for the easy transportation of goods to and from the factories in Bayan Lepas. Furthermore, it connects Penang and the surrounding region with several major regional cities, including Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Bangkok, Jakarta, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Taipei, Ho Chi Minh City and Doha. = Land = The Second Penang Bridge, opened in 2014, is the longest bridge in Southeast Asia. Bayan Lepas is conveniently connected to the Malay Peninsula via the Second Penang Bridge, which links Batu Maung on Penang Island with Batu Kawan in Seberang Perai. In addition, Bayan Lepas is connected to Penang's capital city, George Town, to the north via the Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway, and to Balik Pulau via Federal Route 6. Jalan Bayan Lepas, the main thoroughfare within the town, also forms part of the latter road. Rapid Penang bus routes 302, 308, 401 and 401E include stops within Bayan Lepas proper, while the Penang International Airport is served by routes 102, 306, 401, 401E and AT.http://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/302.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/308.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/401.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/401e.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/102.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/306.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/at.gif These routes link Bayan Lepas to various destinations on Penang Island, including George Town and its suburbs, as well as Balik Pulau and Teluk Kumbar.

It lies at the southern bank of the Perai River and borders Butterworth to the north. Perai gave its name to the city of Seberang Perai, the mainland half of the State of Penang. The area now known as Perai was obtained by the British East India Company in 1800, with the Perai River serving as the boundary between the newly-acquired British territory and Kedah to the north. A nascent railway line was built between Perai and Perak in the 1890s, transforming Perai into a transit point for the export of tin. Perai became heavily industrialised in the late 20th century. Today, Perai is home to an eponymous industrial estate, as well as the adjacent township of Seberang Jaya. The town is connected to Penang Island via the Penang Bridge and contains several facilities of the Port of Penang.  Etymology  Perai, situated at the estuary of the Perai River, lent its name from the waterway. Upon the acquisition of the area by the British East India Company in 1800, the river was known in Thai as plai (), which meant \\"the end\\", as it formed the border between British Province Wellesley and the Siamese vassal state of Kedah; the Perai River thus marked the southernmost limit of Siamese influence. British maps of the era referred to the southern banks of the Perai River as Prye. History The settlement of Perai was formed in the early 19th century, following the acquisition of the area by the British East India Company. In its early years, agriculture formed the mainstay of Perai's economy, with sugar plantations being established within the settlement. Perai was developed into an entrep√¥t towards the end of the 19th century. At the height of a tin- mining boom in the Malay Peninsula, a nascent rail line was built between Perai and the neighbouring state of Perak in the 1890s. Perai then became a transportation hub, where tin imported from Perak was loaded onto vessels to be shipped to George Town. The industrialisation of Perai only began in 1970, when the Penang Development Corporation (PDC) commenced the development of the Perai Industrial Estate and the nearby township of Seberang Jaya. In 1974, the Port of Penang was relocated from George Town to Seberang Perai. Cargo and container facilities were built in both Perai and neighbouring Butterworth, substantially boosting the economy of the area. In 1985, the Penang Bridge which links Perai and Penang Island was completed. The bridge was the longest in Southeast Asia until 2014, upon the opening of the Second Penang Bridge further south.  Geography  Riverine piers in Perai Perai lies at the estuary of the Perai River, which empties into the Penang Strait. The town is located at the river's southern bank, bordering the town of Butterworth to the north. The Perai Industrial Estate encompasses much of Perai's seafront between the Perai River and the Penang Bridge, whilst the township of Seberang Jaya is situated to the east of Perai proper.  Demographics  According to the 2010 Census conducted by Malaysia's Department of Statistics, Perai had a population of 14,433. The proportions of Penang's three major ethnicities - the Chinese, Malays and Indians - were more balanced in Perai, with each ethnic community making up more than a quarter of the town's population. Due to the heavier level of industrialisation within Perai, there has been an influx of foreign workers into the Central Seberang Perai District. , foreigners constituted more than 7% of Perai's population.  Economy  The Perai Industrial Estate is home to numerous multinational and local firms. The major local companies within the area include Malayan Sugar, Ann Joo Resources, Southern Steel, Harvik Rubber and Soon Soon Oilmills. Notably, Malaysia's oldest steel mill and the country's largest sugar refinery, owned by Ann Joo Resources and Malayan Sugar respectively, are situated within the industrial estate. The multinational companies within the area include Mattel, Pensonic, Hitachi, Mitsuoka, Chevron and Honeywell Aerospace. Meanwhile, the Port of Penang, which operates two facilities within Perai, provides logistical connectivity to these heavy industries. Perai's industries are among the major contributors to the dry-bulk volume in the town's port facilities, which also handle shipments of coal and scrap metal. Transportation = Land = The Penang Bridge links Perai with Penang Island (not pictured). Jalan Baru in Perai Jalan Perusahaan Perai is the main thoroughfare within the heart of Perai proper. The road is linked to the Prai River Bridge, which spans the width of the Perai River between Perai and Butterworth. Meanwhile the North‚ÄìSouth Expressway runs through the neighbourhood of Seberang Jaya. The Penang Bridge, opened in 1985, connects Perai with Gelugor on Penang Island. Rapid Penang buses 701, 703, 709 and 801 serve the residents of Perai, connecting the town with Butterworth, Bukit Mertajam and Nibong Tebal.http://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/701.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/703.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/709.gifhttp://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route- maps/details/801.gif In addition, Rapid Penang operates Bridge Express Shuttle Transit (BEST) bus services towards Bayan Lepas on Penang Island, catering mainly to industrial workers, as well as an interstate bus service to the town of Sungai Petani in the neighbouring state of Kedah.http://www.rapidpg.com.my/journey-planner/route-maps/details/sp.gif = Sea = The Port of Penang has two facilities within Perai, namely the Perai Bulk Cargo Terminal and the Perai Wharves.

Situated within the neighbourhood of Seberang Jaya, it also serves as the main hospital within the entire municipality of Seberang Perai. The 393-bed hospital offers various specialist treatments and procedures, including general surgery, nephrology and obstetrics. An ongoing upgrade of the hospital, scheduled for completion by 2021, is expected to increase its capacity by 316 beds.

Sobey, OC (May 24 1902 - December 15, 1985) was a Canadian businessman and art collector who was the primary builder of the Sobeys chain of supermarkets. Life and career Born in the farming community of Lyons Brook, Nova Scotia, to John William (J.W.) Sobey and Eliza Sobey, he was three years old when his family moved to the nearby then-booming coal-mining town of Stellarton. In 1907, his father purchased a meat retailing business and became a butcher, peddling meat products door-to-door from a horse-drawn wagon. In 1912, his father built a 2-storey store in Stellarton's central business district, selling mostly meat and vegetables. In an era where education opportunities were limited in small Maritime towns, Sobey left school after Grade 8. However, he had an entrepreneurial mindset, and at age sixteen enrolled in a business college. In 1924 he persuaded his father to expand the store to carry a full range of groceries and the family began expanding, opening stores in the nearby industrial towns of New Glasgow, Trenton and Westville, and the university town of Antigonish. In the early 1940s, the family wished to purchase a building on Archimedes Street in New Glasgow for a supermarket. The property was owned by a company named Empire Company Ltd. and to acquire the building, the family purchased the company itself. Empire was transformed into the family's holding company and was privatized in 1981. Through Empire Company Ltd., Sobey purchased a local drive-in theatre (renaming it Empire Theatre) and later built a chain of movie theaters, in addition to substantial commercial and residential real estate holdings. In 1971, while still active in the business, Sobey handed over formal control of the company's operations to his three sons, Bill, David and Donald. In the late 1950s, Premier Robert Stanfield appointed Sobey as president of Industrial Estates Limited with a salary of $1/year; Sobey is credited with guiding IEL to make investments in the 1960s that significantly expanded and diversified Nova Scotia's economy. Sobey was also one of the investors behind Peter Munk (chairman of Barrick Gold) in founding Clairtone. Sobey received an honorary Doctor of Laws from Saint Mary's University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and the university named its Faculty of Commerce in his honour. In 1985, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada and was inducted into the Canadian Business Hall of Fame. Sobey married Irene MacDonald on November 24, 1924. They had four children: Bill, David, Donald and Dianne. He died in Halifax in 1985 at the age of 83. Sobey Foundation In 1982, Sobey endowed the Sobey Foundation to provide funding for important initiatives with positive and long-lasting impacts on health, education and communities. The Frank H. Sobey Awards in Business Studies annually provide $10,000 to full-time business students from any Atlantic Canadian university. Saint Mary's University named its commerce program the Sobey School of Business. Sobey Art Foundation  Sobey and his wife Irene acquired a significant art collection that included works by Cornelius Krieghoff, Tom Thomson and notable Group of Seven members A. Y. Jackson and Arthur Lismer. The collection can be seen today at Crombie House, Sobey's former residence in Abercrombie, Nova Scotia. The Sobey Art Foundation was established in 1985 with a mandate to maintain and augment the collection. The foundation's Sobey Art Award is Canada's largest prize for young Canadian artists. It is awarded every two years to an artist 39 years of age or younger who has exhibited work in a public or commercial art gallery in Canada during the previous 18 months. The winner receives up to $70,000 and the 3 runners-up $1,000. References * Bruce, Harry. Frank Sobey: The Man and the Empire (1985 - Macmillan of Canada) * Pitts, Gordon.

All of the stories are illustrated by Edward Jeffrey. The first book, Toby in Pogland, was produced in large format and published in 1946. Four other large format books followed. The standard sized annual format, also published in 1946, began a series that continued until 1958, totalling 14 in all. There were also other formats including small strip books, pop-up books and jigsaws. A series of 8 Toby Twirl Tales, each with two stories, were published between 1950 and 1954.Toby Twirl Book Gallery  The Stories Toby Twirl is a young pig who walks upright. He has human hands and feet like Rupert Bear. The character is based upon a soft toy which was made by the wife of Edward Jeffrey.\\"Toby Twirl, Edward Jeffrey and Ravenstonedale\\" at Ravenstonedale Community Website Toby's friends are Eli (an elephant) and Pete (a penguin), both of whom generally accompany him on his adventures. Most of the stories are written in rhyming couplets. Several of the stories take place in Dillyland, a country of small humans that Toby and friends manage to reach using a miniature railway line with an engine called The Dillypuff crewed by Clem and Joe. There is also a boat called The Dillypaddle. As you'd expect from such stories Toby and friends often accidentally get into trouble or happen upon some villains during their adventures, somehow managing to overcome their difficulties and save the day.  Sheila Hodgetts Children's author, Sheila Hodgetts (born in 1924), is most famous for her stories about ‚ÄúToby Twirl‚Äù, illustrated by Edward Jeffrey (1898-1978), a noted landscape artist and book and magazine illustrator. According to Martin Hockley's The Toby Twirl Adventure Books - A Collector's Guide (Toby Twirl, Ltd., Burghfield Common, 2003, pp 6‚Äì7), Sheila Hodgetts was born on 27 January 1924, in Laindon, Essex. Her family moved later near to Eastbourne, Sussex, where she attended Brighton & Hove High School for Girls as a weekly boarder, a common practice at the time, when secondary schooling was not as widely available as now. During World War II, she joined the WAAF (Women's Auxiliary Air Force) in 1941, and met her husband-to-be who was at that time serving in the RAF (Royal Air Force). They married in 1942 and have (as reported in 2003) two daughters, Tania (born in 1945) and Domini (born in 1948). In 1946, when her husband was demobilised from the RAF, her family moved to the West Midlands where they have lived ever since. Hodgetts is reported to have started her writing career in 1943, but no details of any early titles are known. Hodgetts‚Äô first ‚ÄúToby Twirl‚Äù book was Toby Twirl in Pogland, published in 1946. This story introduced a young male hero, with a human body, and the head (and, at first, twirly tail) of a pig. Toby finds himself in the Kingdom of Pogland, a fairy tale realm, trapped under a spell of sleep. Toby is able to rescue Princess Flower from a wicked witch, breaking the sleeping spell. He also meets a friend, and companion in Toby's later adventures, Peter or Pete the Penguin, who is actually an impulsive black and white penguin about half the size of Toby, and, unlike Toby, wears no clothing. Sheila Hodgetts is reported (by Hockley) as recalling that she had grown up loving Mary Tourtel's Daily Express newspaper comic strip character, Rupert Bear. To recognise the parallels between Toby Twirl and Rupert Bear, it is useful to consider this in some detail. Mary Tourtel (1874-1948) was a children's illustrator, married to Herbert Bird Tourtel, an assistant editor of the Daily Express. Tourtel devised Rupert Bear shortly after the end of World War I, in 1920, when the Daily Express was in competition with The Daily Mail and its then popular comic strip ‚ÄúTeddy Tail‚Äù (featuring a mouse called ‚ÄúTeddy Tail‚Äù), as well as with the comic strip ‚ÄúPip, Squeak and Wilfred‚Äù (respectively, these are the names of a dog, penguin, and rabbit) in the Daily Mirror. Each panel of Tourtel's comic strip story was accompanied by a narrative in rhymed verse. These are the very first (Daily Express, 8 November 1920): Two jolly bears once lived in a wood, Their little son lived there too. One day his mother sent him off The marketing to do. She wanted honey, fruit, and eggs, And told him not to stray, For many things might happen to Small bears who lost their way. (Through the 1920s and 1930s, it is unclear who was the creator of the verses used in Rupert's stories. For example, Caroline G. Bott's The Life and Works of Alfred Bestall: Illustrator of Rupert Bear, Bloomsbury, London, 2003, pp 71, 72, reports Alfred Bestall's recollections that, in 1935, ‚Äúa lady ‚Ä¶ did Mary Tourtel‚Äôs late verse captions (not Hilda Coe)‚Äù, and also that her husband, H.B. Tourtel had ‚Äú[written] the verse‚Äù. Similarly, when Bestall was assigned the task of replacing Tourtel after she retired, Bott quotes at length a Daily Express article by Hilda Coe, 7 November 1945, on the anniversary of Rupert's Silver Jubilee. According to Coe, when Bestall began on 28 June 1935, ‚Äúhe could not write verse, and the youngest readers demanded verse, not once but many times. And so, early in 1936, the Daily Express asked me [Coe] to translate Rupert into verse‚Äù: Bott p 27.) The title of this very first ‚ÄúRupert Bear‚Äù newspaper comic strip was ‚ÄúLittle Lost Bear‚Äù. It also had a short explanatory subtitle: ‚ÄúMrs. Bear sends her little son Rupert to market‚Äù. Rupert Bear had the body of a human boy, and the head of a bear. Many of his friends had human bodies and animal heads, although other characters included humans, dwarves, ogres, and talking birds. Although Rupert, his family, and neighbourhood friends, live in Nutwood, an otherwise ordinary English village, Rupert often found himself stepping into fairy tale regions or distant lands. When Tourtel retired from creating Rupert Bear stories in 1935, the stories were quickly continued in 1935 by Alfred Bestall until he also retired from his work on Rupert stories in 1965. Sheila Hodgetts was the daughter of the Managing Director of Sampson, Low, at that time a major children's publishing company, with the publishing rights for Tourtel's Rupert Bear Stories, and, later, Enid Blyton's ‚ÄúNoddy‚Äù stories, and many others. Hodgetts says, ‚ÄúAfter Mary Tourtel died, my father asked me to write something in the same vein to replace them, and so Toby was born‚Äù (Hockley p 7). In fact, as noted, Rupert Bear stories continued to be written and illustrated by Alfred Bestall, from 1935, when Mary Tourtel retired. Moreover, Tourtel died in 1948, two years after Toby Twirl first appeared. Clearly, Hodgetts was not replacing Rupert after Tourtel died, but was adding to Sampson, Low's publication list when wartime restrictions (such as paper rationing) were being lifted and new marketing opportunities beckoned. In this first story, Toby Twirl in Pogland, we meet Toby Twirl at the beach: Toby Twirl strolled by the sea, Wondering what to do, When he saw a little rowing boat So across the sand he flew. A man was busy mending nets. Toby went up and said, ‚ÄúCould you tell me if that boat‚Äôs for hire?‚Äù But the man just shook his head. He looked young Toby up and down. ‚ÄúHow much?‚Äù he then enquired. So after a lot of argument The rowing boat was hired. Then Toby Twirl jumped in at once, Thrilled by his lucky find. He rowed with all his might and main To leave the shore behind. When suddenly, some distance off He spied a mighty bird. He trembled as it nearer came, And the beat of wings he heard. The bird picked Toby from the boat, And held him in its beak. Toby struggled and cried for help Until he was tired and weak. [Sub-heading for the next page: Toby Listens to the Bird's Sad Story] For hours and hours the bird flew on, Uttering not a sound. Then all at once it glided down And set him on the ground. Toby was dazed by his long flight, ‚ÄúPlease take me home,‚Äù he cried. ‚ÄúNo, Toby Twirl, I need your help,‚Äù The great black bird replied. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard of many things you‚Äôve done, Of Witches killed by you. Please help me for I cannot think What I am going to do.‚Äù Toby, quite touched by this appeal Said, ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt you tell me why You are so worried and distressed> To help you then I will try.‚Äù ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù said the bird, ‚Äúit started thus A Prince I used to be. I loved a Princess kind and fair, And she also loved me.‚Äù ‚ÄúHer worthy father, King of Pog, Consented to the match. But in his kingdom lived a Witch, Who wicked plans did hatch.‚Äù ... and so the mystery, and adventure, and danger, unfolds, ... Nothing in Toby Twirl's later adventures explains this earlier history - famed as a Witch killer, and ‚Äúmany things‚Äù ‚Äì of a seemingly ordinary pig-headed young boy wearing overalls (initially blue, but soon to be a trade-mark red) who enjoys a holiday at the seaside. Importantly, many parallels with Tourtel's and Bestall's Rupert Bear are already clear. Other minor details include the use of running sub-headings that flag the next step in the story: ‚ÄúToby Listens to the Bird‚Äôs Sad Story‚Äù. Obviously Tourtel's rhymed quatrains (or whoever devised the quatrains that accompanied Tourtel's comic strip panels and visual narrative) have been borrowed, including Tourtel's occasional archaisms, and convoluting of the order of words for the sake of the generally strict rhythm, and to manage end-rhymes, with strong pauses at the ends of lines ‚Äì such as, ‚ÄúA Prince I used to be‚Äù, and, ‚ÄúWho wicked plans did hatch‚Äù. In some later Toby Twirl stories, Hodgetts uses prose for the narrative, but most of her Toby Twirl stories rely on quatrains. By 1946, Alfred Bestall had been creating fresh Rupert stories for ten years, to some extent continuing Tourtel's version of Rupert, but on advice from the Daily Express (Bott quotes Bestall recalling that Tourtel's husband, ‚ÄúH.B. Tourtel ‚Ä¶ had been a restraining factor over Mary‚Äôs tendency towards the horrific‚Äù, that is, ‚Äúthe brothers Grimm‚Äù: Bott p 72) Bestall deliberately moderated some of Tourtel's more gothic extremes. Bestall's Rupert stories contain, for example, no witches, and none of the ogres and wicked monsters that Tourtel often thrust at Rupert, as though a world of Grimms‚Äô fairy tales loomed in the heart of the dark forest, or behind a high stone wall, or at the end of a long and lonely road. But here, with Hodgetts‚Äô first story about Toby Twirl we return to Tourtel's medieval Grimms‚Äô-like milieu of dark magic. The big black bird, who was once a Prince, quickly explains to Toby that this Witch has an Ugly Son, who also loves the Princess, and the Witch can conjure Evil Sprites within her cauldron on the fiery hearth (the capital-initial letters not only name characters they emphasise the malevolence). The Witch casts a magic spell that turns the King of Pog's people into horrid toads, transforms the Prince into a bird of prey, makes the King dangerously ill, and takes Princess Flower away to a secret hiding place. Naturally, Toby is keen to do what he can to help the Prince, ... As with Tourtel, much depends on coincidence ‚Äì the prince-bird happening to find Toby, vulnerable and alone out at sea; the golden stone walls of the castle of the King of Pog that Toby and the prince-bird happen to reach at the end of their first day of searching (walking, now, not flying) ‚Äì and that thin veil or border between a normal world of a seaside holiday and the dangerous world of magic, witches, and demonic evil. Sheila Hodgetts‚Äô artistic collaborator, Edward Jeffrey, created Toby Twirl, visually (albeit, in a Rupert-like mould), basing Toby on a soft toy that his wife was making at the time. Hodgett's must have explained, also, that the name ‚ÄúTwirl‚Äù, related to the pig-features of the character, and, by implication, Toby's parents, including, in the early stories, an eponymous pig's twirly corkscrew tail. Before illustrating the first of the stories, Toby Twirl in Pogland, Edward Jeffrey had worked for the publishing company, Sampson, Low, producing a large number of book-cover illustrations for adult novels. According to Martin Hockley, he had also worked on the newspaper strips for Rupert Bear (perhaps filling a gap between Tourtel and Bestall, or more likely providing promotional Rupert images in end-pages of non-Rupert books published by the company, as happened later with the softback edition of Toby Twirl in Pogland'Italic text ‚Äúby Sheila Hodgetts. Illustrated by E. Jeffrey. 1947. Large format softback with Rupert Advert‚Äù as reported by Abe Books). Jeffrey was the obvious choice of illustrator for the new Sampson, Low creation, Toby Twirl. From the outset, Edward Jeffrey's illustrations similarly adopt the brothers Grimm's visual tones of Mary Tourtel's illustrations. The Witch looks suitably wicked; her Ugly Son is hard-faced and clearly a stunted homunculus with a humped shoulder; the Evil Sprites are miniature red devils with horns and forked tails. The clothes worn by the King, the Princess, and his courtiers, are obviously medieval gowns, doublets, ermine cloaks, tights, crowns, and regalia. But Sheila Hodgetts‚Äô career as the poet-creator of Toby Twirl goes well beyond her vigorous variants of Mary Tourtel's Grimms‚Äô fairy tale version of Rupert, just as Tourtel herself had been happy to have stories of Rupert set in a realistic modern world of farms and cottages, children's games, village shops and a village school, with not a hint of magic, but just a bit of adventure. Hodgetts is also especially good at the light-hearted and quirky invention of scenario, character and predicament, including: a marzipan man and a town of confectionary people and buildings; a man who is an apple (Pete of Appletown) and servant of an apricot man who is another prince-in- need betrothed to Princess Peach; a clockwork man; a miniature eccentric steam locomotive, the Dilly-Puff, that runs on a rural railway in the land of Lilliputian-small humans ruled by King Dilly, and a corresponding paddle- steamer, the Dilly-Paddle, that plies the gentle by-waters of Paddletown in Dillyland; a Sea Wizard, and, in a separate adventure, an underwater world in which Toby can live without drowning, and meet a Mermaid Princess with a threatening Uncle, and a ferocious Tuffin who has a magic potion that can change the Uncle; old-fashioned pirates; ‚ÄúArabian Nights‚Äù adventures; ... he even finds himself in the Wild West confronting a band of rustlers! Just as Rupert had his regular friends (most of them with human bodies, and animal heads ‚Äì all about the same height, regardless of their different animal species - but also some who were all animal, and others who were wholly human), Toby Twirl has some regular friends. These include, Pete the Penguin, Eli the Elephant (also known, formally, as Eli Phant, his mother being Mrs Phant), Winnie the Wallaby, and a squirrel-headed fellow, as well as some less friendly folk, such as Warty Weasel. Adult characters, such as Mrs Twirl (and less frequently, Mr Twirl) tend to appear briefly at the start and end of the stories to express their relief at Toby's safe return. By contrast, Professor Bison (an actual bison, and an obvious homage to Tourtel's and Bestall's character the Wise Old Goat, an actual goat), is of frequent assistance. Hodgetts sustained Toby Twirl's stories across twelve years of large-format ‚Äúannuals‚Äù - containing several stories, crosswords, board games, colouring-in pictures, and even a Toby Twirl song - from 1946, beginning with The Toby Twirl Annual, through to 1958, Toby Twirl Adventures. These ‚Äúannuals‚Äù were published in time to be purchased as Christmas presents, but after the first volume, were usually simply called ‚ÄúToby Twirl Adventures‚Äù, or something similar, with no mention of ‚Äúannual‚Äù in the title. Hodgetts also wrote four full-length large-format story books, Toby Twirl in Pogland (1946), Toby Twirl Rescues Prince Apricot (1947), Toby Twirl and the Mermaid Princess (1948), and Toby Twirl and the Magic Ring (1952). In smaller hard-back format, Hodgetts also wrote eight ‚ÄúToby Twirl Tales‚Äù, from 1949 to 1954, each having two stories. The first of these contained ‚ÄúThe Weeping Dragon‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Imp of Mischief‚Äù, and the last contained ‚ÄúThe Patchwork Man‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Lost Piccaninny‚Äù. (In passing, it must be admitted that occasionally Hodgetts innocently used racial and other features ‚Äì such as the word ‚Äúpiccaninny‚Äù - that would be criticised nowadays by modern political correctness.) Toby is always looking for something to do, although not always as careful as he might be. For example, in the ‚Äúannual‚Äù Toby Twirl Adventure Stories (1948), which includes a Grimms‚Äô-like story of enchantment, ‚ÄúToby Twirl and the Magic Drum‚Äù, the following story ‚Äì which introduces the secondary, but otherwise realistic world of Dillyland ‚Äì ‚ÄúToby and the Dilly-Puff‚Äù, Toby and his friend Eli Phant are happily wandering around their village neighbourhood. They looked around a saw a shed. / ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs play there,‚Äù Toby cried. So they both raced across to it, / And then the door they tried. The found that it was only latched / So opened it and saw The quaintest train which they were sure / Had not been there before. ‚ÄúTHE DILLY-PUFF‚Äù was written on / The Engine. Toby said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what it‚Äôs called. What fun to find / An engine in this shed.‚Äù And then they climbed inside the cab / Of the Engine and espied A Tinder Box. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs start it up,‚Äù / Then Eli quickly cried. ‚ÄúAll right,‚Äù said Toby, so the two / With the Tinder Box soon lit The wood and coal in the stoke-hole which / Began to crackle and spit. Two levers were inside the cab, / Marked ‚ÄúSTOP‚Äù and one marked ‚ÄúGO‚Äù. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs pull it,‚Äù Toby cried, ‚Äúit might / Start up, you never know. ‚Ä¶ and so on ‚Äì this clearly bodes ill! Toby is also always quick to step in to help, or possibly trigger a surprise adventure. For example, in Toby Twirl Tales No. 6 (1952), ‚ÄúThe Clockwork Man‚Äù: To Toby Twirl's astonishment / He saw, one sunny day, A Clockwork Man who silently / Stood right in Toby's way. Our little friend espied a key / Which lay upon the ground, And taking it, without delay / The Clockwork Man he wound. ‚ÄúOh, thank you kindly, sir!‚Äù exclaimed / The small man in delight. ‚ÄúI was beginning to despair, / For I‚Äôve been here all night.‚Äù Other Toby Twirl materials created by Hodgetts included daily newspaper comic strips, such as for The Yorkshire Evening Post, beginning in 1959. These led to several small landscape-format ‚Äústrip books‚Äù, such as Toby Twirl on Dapple Heath and Toby Twirl and the Talking Poodle (ca. 1954), and Toby Twirl and the Bullfighter, and Toby Twirl and the Marionette. There were also colouring books, magic colouring books (using water), and pop-up books, and jigsaw puzzles. All of the Toby Twirl artwork was by Edward Jeffrey, with some additional colour-work and puzzle pages by R.S. Clark, one of Jeffrey's friends and artistic colleagues. (Clark, best known for his watercolours, is specially credited with the colour-work for the ‚Äúannual‚Äù Toby Twirl Adventures of 1953.) With Jeffrey's illustrations, Sheila Hodgetts also published two non-Toby-Twirl titles: the fairy tale story, The Sleeping City (1947), in which, of course, a magic spell must be broken to wake a sleeping city; and One Magic Night (1947), in which young Terence ventures out, one magic night, to watch the fairies dance, but is bound in magic cobweb by some unpleasant pixies, until a friend, Rufus, a rabbit, brings the Fairy Queen to rescue the boy. Working with several other illustrators (none with the pictorial quality of Jeffrey's art), Hodgetts had an extensive career as an author for several other series of children's books in the 1950s and early 1960s. These included ‚ÄúSleepy Time Tales‚Äù - such as Sleepy Time Tales of Primrose Wood - a series of books that contained fifteen, or twelve, short (five minute) bedtime stories, often with a gentle moral at the end, and a light sense of humour, set in different locales, also including Apricot Farm, Happytown, Puddletown, Candytop Castle, Cuddleytown, Playtime Village, Playtown, Faraway Forest, The Pan Babies, and Sleepy Time Tales of the Little Cherubs. (More than one hundred short stories!) A totally different series featured the ‚ÄúAdventure Twins‚Äù, with daring deeds in helicopters and racing cars appearing on the front-covers: The Adventure Twins Take a Chance (1953), and Thrills With the Adventure Twins (1954). Both of these contain several short stories, the former including: Jungle Treasure, Spies on Rock Island, The Sacred Cobra, The Emperor's Daughter, and Adventure in the Desert. Hodgetts also created several other titles within a series of ‚ÄúCherub story‚Äù books (with a winged cherub appearing on the front cover as a series logo). For example, The Brave Little Cowboy (1952), illustrated by R. MacGillivray, tells the adventures of Little Tex, the bravest cowboy in the Wild West who rides The Range to find adventures with his trusty pony, Ranger. Other titles included The Lost Baby Fairy, Little Kanga‚Äôs Pocket, and The Little Red Lorry (1952), this latter illustrated by Vera Rice-Jay. Sampson, Low, and later, Sampson, Low, Marston, and also Purnell, provided a willing venue for all of Hodgetts‚Äô writing. As recently as 2007, Sheila Hodgetts was involved in the creation and release of a new Toby Twirl book, Toby Twirl and the Reindeer‚ÄìA Christmas Story and Activity Sticker Book (published in 2007 by Toby Twirl Ltd.) This seems to be a fresh edition of an earlier story, ‚ÄúThe Lame Reindeer‚Äù, which initially appeared in the 1957 ‚Äúannual‚Äù Toby Twirl Adventures (1957). The new book includes illustrations by Edward Jeffrey, who died in 1978. The story, in prose, tells how Toby Twirl and some of his friends, including Eli, Pete, and others, find Father Christmas stranded in the snow outside their village. The reindeer pulling the sleigh has a stone in its hoof. Naturally Toby offers to help, and, while Father Christmas catches forty winks under a rug, Toby and his friends help the hobbling reindeer get to the village where the cheerful local blacksmith is able to remove the stone, and sooth the reindeer's hoof, ... Toby Twirl (born in 1946), would have been at least sixty-one in 2007, but he doesn‚Äôt seem a day over ten, and still as resourceful as ever! In Christopher Fowler's column for The Independent'Italic text, ‚ÄúInvisible Ink: No 199 - Sheila Hodgetts‚Äù (Sunday 17 November 2013), Fowler begins: ‚ÄúThis is a first; I can‚Äôt discover anything about Sheila Hodgetts at all. It‚Äôs as if she hid herself entirely.‚Äù That may have been true in 2013, but a great deal can be gleaned, about Hodgetts, and about her work with Edward Jeffrey, from the internet, and Martin Hockley's brief account of Hodgetts and her work is still available. Although Sheila Hodgetts‚Äô writing career spanned far beyond Toby Twirl, it is Toby and his adventures she is remembered for, and will be, deservedly so, very ably brought to visual life by Edward Jeffrey.

LC-14 was used for various manned and unmanned Atlas launches, including the Friendship 7 flight aboard which John Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth. History LC-14 was the first Atlas pad in operation and hosted the initial test flights in 1957‚Äì58. It was also the only one of the original four Atlas pads to never have a booster explode on it. By 1959, it was decided to convert the pad for the Atlas D missile and space launches, and a large service tower was added early in the year. The first Atlas flown from the renovated LC-14 was Missile 7D on May 18; however, a problem with the launcher hold-down arms damaged the missile and caused its explosion shortly after launch. This was traced to improper procedures during the renovation of the pad and was quickly fixed. The first space launch off of LC-14 was the Big Joe Mercury test in September. As the designated Mercury- Atlas facility, LC-14 was thus the only Atlas pad sporting the infrastructure needed for manned launches. The first MIDAS satellites, one Atlas-Able launch, and a few more ICBM tests were conducted from LC-14 before it was completely turned over to NASA. LC-14 is most well known as the launch site for NASA's Mercury-Atlas 6 flight, which made Glenn the first American in orbit. It was also the launch site of the remaining three Mercury-Atlas flights and various unmanned Atlas launches. Later, it was the site for Atlas-Agena launches for the Agena Target Vehicles for Project Gemini. Following decommissioning and abandonment as an active launch site, LC-14 slowly fell into decay. The proximity to the Atlantic Ocean created an ideal environment for corrosion of metal components, and the complex's red metal gantry structures were dismantled for safety reason during the 1970s.Hennig, Katy (July 5, 2014) \\"Historic Documentation: Documenting Cape Canaveral\\" LiDAR News Spatial Media LLC, Frederick, MD Restoration In 1997, the 45th Space Wing embarked on a partial restoration of LC-14 under the aegis of the 45th Operations Support Squadron and its commander, Lt Col Dennis Hilley, USAF. Although extensive repairs were made by Boeing and Johnson Controls, with additional assistance from Lockheed Martin and Brown and Root, the restoration utilized no military construction or military operations and maintenance funding and was effected strictly with military, DoD civilian, NASA civilian, DoD contractor and NASA contractor volunteers. Several months later, the exterior and interior of the original blockhouse and its nearby astronaut parking area had been restored, with the blockhouse converted into a conference facility for military, NASA and contractor use. Present at the dedication in May 1998 were former Mercury astronauts Colonel Gordon Cooper, USAF (Ret.) and Commander Scott Carpenter, USN (Ret.); Mrs. Betty Grissom, widow of Lt Col Gus Grissom, USAF; and comedian Bill Dana, known for his \\"Jos√© Jim√©nez, the reluctant astronaut\\" character. Appearing periodically on The Ed Sullivan Show in the 1960s, the character caught on as a subject of humor among the seven Mercury astronauts. Among other Mercury astronauts, former U.S. Senator (and Colonel, USMC (Ret.)) John Glenn could not attend due to preparations for his then-pending Space Shuttle flight (STS-95), and Captain Wally Schirra, USN (Ret.) could not attend due to a scheduling conflict. Deke Slayton had died in 1993, while Rear Admiral Alan Shepard, USN (Ret.) extended his regrets due to illness. Largely unknown at the time was that Shepard was suffering from terminal leukemia, and he died shortly after the dedication. In addition to the total interior renovation, the blockhouse contains historical documents, photos and memorabilia from Project Mercury, as well as photos of the blockhouse area before, during and after the restoration. Future improvements to the pad itself are also planned as time and contributory funding permits. The entrance road to LC-14 is marked by several memorials and signs commemorating Project Mercury and the four of six manned Mercury missions launched there. This includes a large sculpture of the Project Mercury symbol constructed of titanium, under which is buried a time capsule containing technical documents of the Mercury program. The time capsule is scheduled to be opened in 2464, 500 years after the official conclusion of the program.http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMH6RF_Mercury_7_Time_Capsule_Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station With its withdrawal from operational status, a memorial marker in granite was also placed at the beginning of the concrete ramp that leads to LC-14's launch pad and two outdoor kiosks were erected to contain historical photos.

Batu Maung is home to the island terminus of the Second Penang Bridge and the southern end of the Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway. It is also surrounded by fishing villages such as Permatang Damar Laut and Teluk Tempoyak. Formerly an agricultural village, the development of Batu Maung into a residential neighbourhood began in the late 20th century.

In addition, the Second Penang Bridge connects the neighbourhood with Seberang Perai, the mainland half of the State of Penang. Opened in 2014, the long bridge is currently the longest in Southeast Asia. The major roads within Batu Maung are Jalan Batu Maung and Jalan Permatang Damar Laut. Due to the worsening traffic congestion, road-widening projects have commenced along stretches of these roads.

However, when the Imperial Japanese Army invaded Penang in December 1941, the Commonwealth forces, led by Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival, evacuated Penang Island without a shot being fired. The abandoned fort was subsequently captured and put to use by the Japanese during the war. Following the war's end, the fort was left forgotten until its eventual conversion into a war museum in 2002. The Penang War Museum still retains the original military structures and equipment left behind by the British forces, such as bunkers, tunnels and machine-gun emplacements.

M. W. Turner's 1816 painting of Leeds, from Beeston Hill. At the left-hand edge is Marshall's Mill, in the Centre is Trinity Church, and further to the right, through the smoke, is the tower of Leeds Parish Church, now Leeds Minster. Loidis, from which Leeds derives its name, was anciently a forested area of the Celtic kingdom of Elmet. The settlement certainly existed at the time of the Norman conquest of England and in 1086 was a thriving manor under the overlordship of Ilbert de Lacy. It gained its first charter from Maurice de Gant in 1207 yet only grew slowly throughout the medieval and Tudor periods. The town had become part of the Duchy of Lancaster and reverted to the crown in the medieval period, so was a Royalist stronghold at the start of the English Civil War. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries Leeds prospered and expanded as a centre of the woollen industry and it continued to expand rapidly in the Industrial Revolution. Following a period of post industrial decline in the mid twentieth century Leeds' prosperity revived with the development of tertiary industrial sectors. Name The name \\"Leeds\\" is first attested in the form \\"Loidis\\": around 731 Bede mentioned it in book II, chapter 14 of his Historia ecclesiastica, in a discussion of an altar surviving from a church erected by Edwin of Northumbria, located in \\"...regione quae vocatur Loidis\\" ('the region known as Loidis'). This was evidently a regional name, but it subsequently occurs in the 1086 Domesday Book denoting a settlement, in the later Old English form Ledes.A. D. Mills, A Dictionary of English Place Names (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), s.v. (The 1725 map by John Cossins spells it as Leedes.) The name is not Old English in form, so is presumably an Anglo-Saxonisation of an earlier Celtic name. It is hard to be sure what this name was; Mills's A Dictionary of British Place-Names prefers Celtic *LƒÅdenses 'people living by the strongly flowing river'. This name may be derived from the Brittonic *lƒÅto- meaning \\"rut, heat\\" (in animals ready to mate), an element represented in Welsh as llawd, \\"heat\\", and possibly cognate to Greek pl≈çt√≥s, \\"flowing\\". It has been surmised that the name denoted either a forest covering most of the kingdom of Elmet, which existed during the fifth century into the early seventh,The Story of English Towns ‚Äì Leeds J. S. Fletcher, Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, 1919 or an early river-name, presumably that of the River Aire. An inhabitant of Leeds is locally known as a Loiner, possibly derived from Loidis. Leeds City Council maintains \\"a photographic archive of Leeds\\" using the title \\"Leodis\\",Leeds City Council, Leodis - a photographic archive of Leeds thought to be an Old English or Celtic form of the name.Wikimedia Foundation, Wiktionary: Leeds, accessed 26 August 2020 Prehistoric to Anglo- Saxon periods There is no dependable reference to any place that might be associated with Leeds, before Bede's mention in circa 730 AD; and that was to a region rather than a village or town; thus little is known of any Roman, British or Anglo-Saxon predecessors to Leeds. As well as scattered Bronze Age objects throughout the Leeds area, there were, according to 19th-century records, two Bronze Age barrows on Woodhouse Moor.Susan Wrathmell and others, Leeds, Pevsner Architectural Guides (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2005), 4. In the pre-Roman and Roman Iron Age, the vicinity of Leeds was associated with the Brigantes; as well as possible Roman-period earthworks, a paved ford across the River Aire has been discovered, and is supposed to date to Roman times.http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Periods/Roman/Topics/Engineering/roads/Britain/_Texts/CODROM/4*.html; Susan Wrathmell and others, Leeds, Pevsner Architectural Guides (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2005), 4. Brigantian remains have been found in villages and towns in the vicinity of Leeds, and there are Roman remains in nearby settlements, notably at Adel, and at Alwoodley; in the suburb of Headingley a stone coffin was found in 1995 at Beckett's Park which is believed to date from Roman times. Bede's account indicates activity in the vicinity of Leeds, though not necessarily near the town as it is now known: his unidentified place-name Campodonum might refer to an important place in the area; and one Abbot Thrythwulf had a monastery nearby in Bede's time, though it did not last long into the medieval period. Campodonum is possibly, Elmet capital and roman fort (anylised as camp+(l)odonum), Cambodunum. Cambodunum is a possible earlier latin form name of Camelot, likely due to it‚Äôs location and early Brittonic ties. Evidence for major wealth and status comes from fragments of at least six stone crosses/other monuments, with the ninth- to tenth-century decoration characteristic of Anglo-Scandinavian culture, which were found in the fabric of the 14th-century Leeds Parish Church when it was demolished and replaced in 1838, now site of Leeds Minster. The best preserved, now in the modern church, depicts alongside other images the story of Wayland the Smith. Leeds's profile was raised by the 2008-09 discovery of the West Yorkshire Hoard, a small, probably tenth- or eleventh- century treasure hoard of items from the early 7th century onwards, in the Leeds area.https://www.theguardian.com/uk/the-northerner/2011/nov/08/leeds- hoard-anglo-saxon-gold-winwaed-kat-baxter-alaric-hall-leeds-phil-lit; http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/459594; http://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/391699. It seems likely that the Anglo-Saxon settlement consisted largely of an ecclesiastical site, a ford over the River Aire, and Kirkgate. Other evidence for occupation in the Anglo- Saxon period lies in the old Shire Oak at Headingley, which is believed to have lent its name to the wapentake of Skyrack, and in the presence of many places around Leeds which have the termination of their names in ley: such as Bramley, Rodley, Farnley, Armley, Wortley, and Farsley, which is derived from the Anglo-Saxon leah, an open place in the wood. Norman period Leeds parish is thought to have developed from a large British multiple estate which, under subsequent Anglo-Saxon occupation was further sub divided into smaller land holdings. The ancient estate straddled the wapentakes of Morley Open Domesday Online: Morley Wapentake and Skyrack, Open Domesday Online: Skyrack Wapentake encompassing Leeds, Headingley, Allerton, Gipton, Bramley, Armley, Farnley, Beeston and Ristone (Wortley). Leeds parish in Skyrack was the most important of these holdings. Leeds was then further sub divided so that when the first dependable historical record about Leeds (as \\"Ledes\\") was written in the Domesday book of 1086, it was recorded as having comprised seven small manors in the days of Edward the Confessor. At the time of the Norman conquest, Leeds was evidently a purely agricultural domain, of about in extent. It was divided into seven manors, held by as many thanes; they possessed six ploughs; there was a priest, and a church, and a mill: its taxable value was six pounds. When the Domesday records were made, it had slightly increased in value; the seven thanes had been replaced by twenty- seven villains, four sokemen, and four bordars. The villains were what we should now call day-labourers: the soke or soc men were persons of various degrees, from small owners under a greater lord, to mere husbandmen: the bordars are considered by most specialists in Domesday terminology to have been mere drudges, hewers of wood, drawers of water. The mill, when this survey was made, was worth four shillings. There were of meadow. The tenant in chief was Ilbert de Lacy to whom William the Conqueror had granted a vast Honour stretching widely across country from Lincolnshire into Lancashire, and whose chief stronghold was at Pontefract Castle, a few miles to the south- east. That Leeds was owned by one of the chief favourites of William was fortunate; the probability is that the lands of the de Lacy ownership were spared when the harrying of the North took place. While the greater part of the county was absolutely destitute of human life, and all the land northward lay blackened, Leeds in 1086 had a population of at least two hundred people. There were two significant foci to the settlement; the area around the parish church and the main manorial landholding half a mile to the west of the church. In 1399, according to the Hardynge Chronicle, the captive Richard II was briefly imprisoned at Leeds, before being transported to another de Lacy property at Pontefract, where he was later executed. :The kyng then sent kyng Richard to Ledis, :there to be kepte durely in previtee; :fro thens after to Pykering went he needis, :and to Knaresbro' after led was he :but to pontefrete last where he did dee. In 1147, Cistercian monks settled at Kirkstall, and there from about 1152 began to build Kirkstall Abbey. First borough charter Leeds was subinfeudated ‚Äì along with much other land in Yorkshire, by the de Lacy family to the Paynel family; Ralph Paynel is mentioned often in the Domesday entries. He was one of the principal tenants- in-chief in Yorkshire. It was from a descendant of the Paynels, sometimes described as Maurice de Gant, that the inhabitants of Leeds received their first charter, in November, 1207. Leeds had the geographical advantages of being on a river crossing and being on the York to Chester route as well as being close to the Wharfedale to Skipton route through the Pennines. The manorial lords were keen to increase their revenues by exploiting these advantages. The preamble of the charter reads: :\\"I Maurice Paynall have given and granted and by this charter confirmed to my burgesses of Leeds and their heirs franchise and free burgage and their tofts and with each toft half an acre of land for tillage to hold these of me and my heirs in fief and inheritance freely quit and honourably rendering annually to me and my heirs for each toft and half an acre of land sixteen pence at Pentecost and at Martinmas.\\" The charter made various provisions for the appointment of a bailiff (prator) to preside over a court of justice, to collect rents and dues, and to fine recalcitrants; others stipulated for aids when the lord needed monetary help, and placed tenants under obligation to grind corn at his mill and bake in his oven. Leeds was granted some rights of self-government and it had burgesses who were freemen. Yet the charter granted to the townspeople of Leeds only the lowest conditions needed for urban development. It did not transform the manor into a borough but established a borough within a manor. It was not coextensive with the manor but consisted of only a group of tenements within it. The new town was laid out along the line of a street, later to be called Briggate, which was wide enough to hold a market, with about thirty burgage plots on either side. The south end of the street had a river crossing but the earliest recorded bridge, from which its name is derived (bridge gate), is in 1384. The population was small in 1207 and remained scanty for a long time afterwards. At the time of the Poll Tax of 1379 it appears not to have exceeded three hundred persons at the very outside; it was certainly one of the smallest towns in Yorkshire, such places as Snaith, Ripon, Tickhill, and Selby exceeding it in importance. Even in the thirteenth century, Leeds consisted of several distinct areas of habitation and activity. There was the old settlement around the parish church, the newly founded borough, the manor house and mill to the west and the town fields at Burmantofts (borough men's tofts). By establishing the borough the manorial revenues were increased and Leeds became more prosperous. Tax returns of 1334 and 1377 show that population of the whole parish before the Black Death was about 1,000 people of whom 350 to 400 lived in the central area including the borough. Leeds began to rank with the more prosperous towns to the east. In 1217 Maurice de Gant lost the Leeds estate by figuring on the wrong side at the battle of Lincoln. His holding passed from him to Ranulf, Earl of Chester, and through him reverted to the de Lacy family; when the de Lacy estates became merged by marriage in the Duchy of Lancaster they passed to the royal family, and, on the accession of Henry IV, were absorbed into the possessions of the Crown. Late Middle Ages For four centuries after the Norman invasion, the growth of Leeds was slow. Its site had no particular military advantages: the great strategic position of that part of Yorkshire was at Pontefract, close by. It had, at first, no commercial values‚Äîit may have been that its first beginnings in its staple wool trade sprang from the wool growing of the Cistercians at Kirkstall Abbey, on its western borders. The township was concerned with little more than agriculture, and such trade as it knew was confined to those retailings which establish themselves wherever communities spring up‚Äîdealings in the necessities of life, which, reduced to a minimum, are merely food and clothing. The town itself was small‚Äîit was probably confined within a triangle formed on the lines of the present lower Briggate, Kirkgate, and the River Aire, with the parish church at one angle somewhere about, perhaps on, the site of the modern one. The streets would be narrow, unpaved and unlighted. The houses, in spite of the fact that stone is so plentiful in the district, were of wood, whitewashed, in many cases, thatched. St Mary's Whitkirk is the only medieval church remaining, a 15th century building replacing an earlier one. All around the town lay the open fields and meadows, cultivated on the principle of strip-farming. And beyond these lay the forest of Elmet. Tudor period and incorporation The Tudor period was a time of transition for Leeds, from a relatively mean settlement to a solid cloth-trading town. In 1470, it was obscure enough to be described as being \\"near to Rothwell\\", which in the fifteenth century had the rights of a market town. By 1536, when John Leland visited it, he was able to report of it that it was a pretty market town which stood most by clothing and was as large as Bradford, though not so \\"quik\\", by which he evidently meant not so enterprising. Nevertheless, much of the old life and conditions still existed. The Crown was now over-lord, and had been so ever since the accession of Henry IV, and the folk still ground their corn at the King's mills and baked their bread at the King's oven. There was as yet no charter of incorporation, and though the people were rapidly approaching to conditions of liberty their lot was still not very appreciably different from that of their forefathers. Up to the end of the sixteenth century Leeds may be looked upon as existing in semi- feudalism. There is no mention of education in Leeds until 1552, when one William Sheafield, who seems to have been a chantry priest of St. Catherine in Leeds, left property in the town for the establishment of a learned school- master who should teach freely for ever such scholars, youths, and children as should resort to him, with the wise proviso that the Leeds folk themselves should find a suitable building and make up the master's salary to ten pounds a year. Here is the origin of Leeds Grammar School which, first housed in the Calls, and subsequently‚Äîthrough the beneficence of John Harrison‚Äîin Lady Lane, had by the end of that century become an institution of vast importance. A 1560 map of Leeds As the sixteenth century drew to a close, and while the seventeenth was still young, the towns-folk of Leeds secured in the first instance at their own cost, in the second by a strictly limited Royal favour two important privileges‚Äîthe right of electing their own vicar and of governing themselves in municipal affairs. In 1583 the town bought the advowson of the parish church from its then possessor, Oliver Darnley, for ¬£130, and henceforth the successive vicars were chosen by a body of trustees‚Äîthe most notably successful experiment in popular election which has ever been known in the National Church. In 1626, Leeds received its first charter of incorporation from Charles I. The charter, premising that Leeds in the County of York is an ancient and populous town, whose inhabitants are well acquainted with the Art and Mystery of making Woollen Cloths, sets up a governing body of one Alderman, nine Burgesses, and twenty Assistants. But the privilege for some years was a limited one: the Crown reserved to itself the rights of appointment to any of the thirty vacancies which might occur by death: popular election did not come for some time. English Civil War and political representation Eighteen years after the granting of the charter of incorporation, Leeds joined with other towns in the neighbourhood in a Memorial to the King wherein he was besought to settle his differences with the rebellious Parliament. Of this no notice was taken, and in the earlier stages of the Civil War the town was garrisoned for the Royal cause under Sir William Savile. But it was a very small Leeds which he occupied for the King in January 1643, having under him 500 horse and 1,500 foot. He made elaborate preparations for the defence of the place, digging a six-foot trench from St. John's Church by Upper Headrow, Boar Lane, and Swinegate to the banks of the river; erecting breastworks at the north end of the bridge, and placing demi- culverins in a position to sweep Briggate. Against him on Monday, January 23, advanced the redoubtable Sir Thomas Fairfax, at the head of a Parliamentary force which appears to have numbered at least 3000 horse and foot. Finding the bridge at Kirkstall broken down, Fairfax crossed the Aire at Apperley Bridge, and came on to Woodhouse Moor, from where he called on Savile to surrender. Savile returned the answer which was doubtless expected, and in the teeth of a heavy snowstorm, Fairfax led his troops forward to the assault. The action began about two o'clock of the afternoon and appears to have developed on all sides of the town. It rapidly went in favour of the assailants, and by four o'clock the Parliamentarian leaders and their troops were in Briggate and Boar Lane, while Savile and others were fleeing for their lives. Fairfax took nearly 500 prisoners and immediately released them on their promising not to take up arms against the Parliament on any further occasion. Though not a very great affair, it settled the question of King or Commons so far as that part of the West Riding was concerned. The Puritan regime followed on the first successes of the Parliamentarians, and Leeds saw two Puritan ministers placed in the parish church and the new church of St. John. But in 1644 Leeds folk had something else to think: an epidemic, so serious as to rank with the medieval visitations of plague, broke out, and resulted in the death of 1300 inhabitants. The weekly markets were discontinued, and deaths occurred with such startling rapidity that it was impossible to keep pace with them in the parish registers. In 1646 Charles I. came to Leeds a prisoner. After his surrender to the Scottish generals at Kelham, near Newark, he was led northward to Newcastle; on his return from that city, he spent one night in the house called Red Hall, in Upper Head Row. It seems curious that up to the middle of the seventeenth century Leeds had never been directly represented in Parliament. Many now quite insignificant places in Yorkshire had sent members to the House of Commons from a very early period--Malton, Beverley, Northallerton had returned members as far back as 1298; Otley had had two members for centuries. But it was not until 1654 that Adam Baynes was returned to sit at Westminster; he was returned again two years later with Francis Allanson as a second member. This representation came to an end at the Restoration in 1660, and Leeds had no more members of Parliament until the Reform Act 1832. But in 1661 it received some concession from the Crown which was perhaps of more importance to it‚Äîa new Municipal Charter. There had been some readjustment of the old one in 1642, but Charles II's Charter was of a far-reaching nature. It set up a Mayor, twelve Aldermen, twenty-four Assistants or Councillors, a Town Clerk, and a Recorder; it also provided for local election to vacancies. From the Charter of Charles I and that of his son are derived the well-known arms of the town. The owls are the Savile owls famous throughout the county, where the Saviles have been legion; the mullets figured on the arms of Thomas Danby, first Mayor. The dependent sheep typifies the wool trade. In 1715 the first history of Leeds was written by Ralph Thoresby, entitled Ducatus Leodiensis; or the Topography of the antient and populous Town and Parish of Leedes. Leeds was mainly a merchant town, manufacturing woollen cloths and trading with Europe via the Humber estuary and the population grew from 10,000 at the end of the seventeenth century to 30,000 at the end of the eighteenth. As a gauge of the importance of the town, by the 1770s Leeds merchants were responsible for 30% of the country's woollen exports, valued at ¬£1,500,000 when 70 years previously Yorkshire accounted for only 20% of exports.R. G. Wilson, Gentlemen merchants the merchant community in Leeds 1700-1830, p.44 A 1725 map of Leeds An 1806 map of Leeds An 1866 map of Leeds A 1900 map of Leeds Woollen cloth trade Weaving was introduced into West Yorkshire in the reign of Edward III, and Cistercians, such as at Kirkstall, were certainly engaged in sheep farming. Leland (date) records the organised trading of cloth on the bridge over the Aire, at the foot of Briggate, at specified times and under set conditions. The traded woollen cloth was predominantly of home manufacture, produced in the villages and settlements surrounding Leeds. (Bradford, by contrast, was the centre of the worsted cloth trade.) There was, however, a fulling mill at Leeds by 1400, and cloth dying may also have been an early centralised activity. Before the time of Defoe's visit to Leeds, cloth trading outstripped the capacity of the bridge, and moved instead to trestle tables in up to two rows on each side of Briggate. Defoe mentions that at this time Leeds traders went all over the country, selling cloth on credit terms; and that an export trade existed. Ralph Thoresby was involved in the establishment of the first covered cloth market, when with others he secured the permission of the 3rd Viscount Irwin, holder of Manor of Leeds, to erect the White Cloth Hall. The fact of Wakefield having erected a trading hall in 1710 was almost certainly a driver of change. The new hall opened on 22 May 1711, and lasted for 65 years before being removed to a new site in the Calls, and later at the time of the railways to the present trading hall. In 1758 a coloured or mixed cloth hall was built near Mill Hill ‚Äì a quadrangular building by , with capacity for 1800 trading stalls, initially let at 3 guineas per annum, but later trading at a premium of ¬£24 per annum. The hall was pulled down in 1899 to make way for the new General Post Office; the last White Cloth hall in 1896 to make way for the Metropole Hotel. In 1831, a strike at Gotts Woollen Mill led to the establishment of the Yorkshire Trades Union. This soon dissolved, but in 1887 the Yeadon and Guiseley Factory Workers' Union was founded, this later becoming part of the National Union of Dyers, Bleachers and Textile Workers.  Industrial Revolution Expansion  Construction of the former Leeds Tramway along Roundhay Road in Harehills, Leeds. Bridge End in Leeds city centre, 1869. The industrial revolution had resulted in the radical growth of Leeds whose population had risen to over 150,000 by 1840. The city's industrial growth was catalysed by the introduction of the Aire & Calder Navigation in 1699, Leeds and Liverpool Canal in 1816 and the railways from 1834 onwards; the first being the Leeds and Selby Railway opened on 22 September 1834. The first Leeds railway station was at Marsh Lane; the Leeds Wellington station was opened in 1848; the Central in 1854, and the New station in 1869. Little by little the town was linked up with Hull, York, Sheffield, Bradford, Dewsbury; with the Durham and Northumberland towns; with Manchester and Liverpool; and with the Midlands and London. In 1893 Leeds had been granted city status. These industries that developed in the industrial revolution had included making machinery for spinning, machine tools, steam engines and gears as well as other industries based on textiles, chemicals and leather and pottery. Coal was extracted on a large scale and the still functioning Middleton Railway, the first successful commercial steam locomotive railway in the world, transported coal into the centre of Leeds. The track was the first rack railway and the locomotive (Salamanca) was the first to have twin cylinders. Various areas in Leeds developed different roles in the industrial revolution. The city centre became a major centre of transport and commerce, Hunslet and Holbeck became major engineering centres. Armley, Bramley and Kirkstall became milling centres and areas such as Roundhay became middle class suburbs, the building of the Leeds Tramway allowing them better connections with the rest of the city.  Modern history  By the 20th century this social and economic had started to change with the creation of the academic institutions that are known today as the University of Leeds and Leeds Beckett University. This period had also witnessed expansion in medical provision, particularly Leeds General Infirmary and St James's Hospital. Following the Second World War there has been, as in many other cities, a decline in secondary industries that thrived in the 19th century. However this decline was reversed in the growth of new tertiary industries such as retail, call centres, offices and media. Today Leeds is known as one of eight core cities that act as a focus of their respective regions and Leeds is generally regarded as the dominant city of the ceremonial county of West Yorkshire. Wartime  Leeds war memorial =Great War= Leeds made a notable contribution during the First World War. Leeds suffered no raids during the war; however, it suffered significant losses during the war. Barnbow Barnbow in Cross Gates was a large ammunitions factory producing ten thousand shells per week by August 1915. The worst tragedy ever to happen within Leeds (in terms of fatalities) happened at the Barnbow tragedy of 5 December 1916. 35 workers (all women aged 14 or over) were killed in the Barnbow Munitions Factory, which later became the Royal Ordnance Factory Barnbow. The plant employed 16,000 workers, from Leeds, Selby, Wakefield, Tadcaster and Wetherby and had its own railway station to cope with the daily influx of workers. The railway station had an platform and 38 special trains from surrounding towns and cities. An explosion from Hall 42 killed 35 workers and mutilated many more. Mechanic Mr William Parking was presented with an engraved silver watch for his bravery in saving factory workers during the incident.http://www.elhas.org.uk/reports/barnbowt.htm Leeds Pals During the First World War, regiments were made up of men from particular towns, meaning that if one regiment suffered heavy losses, a town or city would suffer heavy losses of its male population. Leeds was one city unfortunate enough to suffer this. By the Second World War, regiments weren't so geographically based. The battalion formed in 1914 and suffered its worse losses in the Battle of the Somme in 1916. =Second World War= During the Second World War Leeds made a further contribution to the war effort, although it was perhaps less historically notable than that of the first. Although the result of the sinking of the third Royal naval vessel named 'Ark Royal' which was Leeds's adopted ship the people of Leeds raised over ¬£9 million in 1942 for a new ship, surpassing the ¬£5 million target. Bombing Anti- aircraft guns in Leeds in 1941 Leeds escaped the worst of The Blitz, due mainly to its inland location and it not having any significant industrial targets. On the night of the 14 March and early hours of 15 March 1941, Leeds received its worst night of Luftwaffe bombing. Beeston had more bombs dropped on it than any other district of the city, yet escaped with the least damage. Flaxton Terrace was the only street to be damaged during the night-time blackout air raid, with nearly all the other bombs landing on Cross Flatts Park. In his 2005 poem 'Shrapnel' poet Tony Harrison, who was in Beeston on the night of the raid, speculates whether this was an act of heroism by the Luftwaffe pilot, a theory that has been explored ever since the raid.https://www.bbc.co.uk/leeds/content/articles/2008/12/12/local_history_beeston_bombing_feature.shtml Significant damage was also caused in Holbeck and Headingley, while the Eastern side of the Town Hall was damaged. Bombs were also dropped on the Woodhouse area during nighttime air raids, as the Luftwaffe attempted to destroy an industrial target. Thorp Arch ROF Thorp Arch was the main munitions factory in the area at this time. The facility which is now a trading estate and retail park, was situated near Wetherby and like Barnbow featured significant railway facilities. The works suffered minor damage from bombing raids. People from all over West Yorkshire travelled to work at the facility by train from Leeds and Wetherby stations. Yeadon The town of Yeadon housed the underground factory that manufactured the parts for Avro Lancaster bombers. The factory was located alongside the current Leeds Bradford Airport. Rodley Rodley to the west had two factories, Smiths and Booths, that manufactured cranes and had been converted to make bombs.

It was developed by Scottish advertising agency Struthers Advertising, and featured the phrase \\"Glasgow's Miles Better\\" wrapped around the cartoon figure of Mr. Happy. It is regarded as one of the world's earliest and most successful attempts to rebrand a city, and received a number of domestic and international awards. Background In 1982, Struthers Advertising had undertaken an anti-smoking campaign for the Scottish Health Education Group featuring members of the Scotland national football team under the theme \\"The squad don't smoke\\". Later that year, the then Lord Provost of Glasgow Michael Kelly announced plans to make Glasgow a no smoking city by the year 2000. John Struthers wrote to Michael Kelly offering assistance with the No Smoking aim. The Lord Provost said he was simply the figurehead for the No Smoking group but he and John Struthers met over coffee. During that meeting, the Lord Provost said how much he wanted a campaign for Glasgow similar to the highly successful I Love New York campaign but the City had no money to fund such an initiative. As a result of that meeting, John Struthers undertook not only to create but also initially fund the development of a campaign capable of meeting the Lord Provost's objectives. Various concepts were developed and rejected but in March 1983 Struthers presented the Glasgow's Miles Better proposal to Kelly supported with a fund raising strategy. The Lord Provost loved the whole concept and personally took it on board. Struthers and Kelly made a formidable combination that gave the whole campaign an impetus hitherto unseen in UK civic marketing activity. The campaign was launched in June 1983 by the Lord Provost to immense media attention and comment and in a very short time, the slogan, \\"Glasgow's Miles Better\\" had entered the UK vocabulary. Some ¬£100,000 was raised as a result of the Struthers fund raising proposals followed by the Scottish Development Agency (now Scottish Enterprise) agreeing to match this sum pound for pound. The reason for their contribution was due to a report they had commissioned, part of which suggested that the City of Glasgow would derive significant economic benefits from increased external marketing activity. When this funding was put in place, the City of Glasgow finally decided to offer financial support from their Common Good Fund amounting to some ¬£60,000. The campaign ran across UK media and was supported by extensive PR initiatives. One of the most remarkable PR stories concerned Glasgow's rival city Edinburgh. One of the Struthers recommendations was to target tourists during the Edinburgh Festival, so a modest campaign was booked to run on the sides of six Edinburgh buses. In the 1980s, Edinburgh buses were owned by Edinburgh Council which took umbrage at the thought of Glasgow being promoted on their buses and as a result, they banned the campaign. Within days, the story of Edinburgh banning Glasgow had gone worldwide and even made the front page of the Wall Street Journal. The coverage was immense and the Miles Better campaign owed a debt of gratitude to the City of Edinburgh for their assistance in promoting Glasgow to a global audience. Glasgow had previously suffered from a reputation as a hard-drinking, gang-ridden, working-class city. The campaign initially targeted the citizens of Glasgow and encouraged them to support the activity which focused on the cultural richness of Glasgow, its environment (more parkland per head of population than any other city in Europe), its mild climate and its suitability for enterprise. The result was a very significant change in the way Glasgow was perceived externally and the figure of Mr. Happy from the Mr. Men children's books appeared on posters and badges alongside the slogan. In analysing the campaign, Brown, Moran and Gaudin (2013) suggest it \\"is considered to be one of the best city promotions ever mounted by any British city. It put a smile on a city that was both down on its heels and negatively perceived.\\" John Struthers was the man credited with devising the \\"Glasgow's Miles Better\\" campaign.\\"John Struthers: Advertising man credited with devising the famous Glasgow's Miles Better campaign\\", The Herald (Glasgow), 3 October 2001. Retrieved 31 October 2012 The catch-phrase is a famous example of a null comparative. In later phases of the campaign the catch-phrase was adapted in a number of ways, such as \\"Glasgow smiles better\\". Edinburgh apparently responded to the campaign with a billboard and banner advertising campaign bearing the slogan, \\"Edinburgh: Count Me In\\".

Function  The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the apolipoprotein C family. This gene is expressed primarily in the liver, and it is activated when monocytes differentiate into macrophages. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene, but the biological validity of some variants has not been determined. Apolipoprotein C1 has a length of 57 amino acids normally found in plasma and responsible for the activation of esterified lecithin cholesterol with an important role in the exchange of esterified cholesterol between lipoproteins and in removal of cholesterol from tissues. Its main function is inhibition of CETP, probably by altering the electric charge of HDL molecules. During fasting (like other apolipoprotein C), it is found primarily within HDL, while after a meal it is found on the surface of other lipoproteins. When proteins rich in triglycerides like chylomicrons and VLDL are broken down, this apoprotein is transferred again to HDL. It is one of the most positively charged proteins in the human body.  Pseudogene  A pseudogene of this gene is located 4 kb downstream from the apoC-I gene in the same orientation on chromosome 19, where both reside within an apolipoprotein gene cluster. This pseudogene, which was also reported to have been present in Denisovans and Neandertals, originated from two separate events. Following the divergence of New World monkeys from the human lineage, the apoC-I gene was duplicated. Old World monkeys and great apes other than humans have been shown to have two active genes. One of the duplicates encodes a basic protein designated apoC-IB that is orthologous to human apolipoprotein C-I. The other encodes an acidic protein, apoC-IA, that is orthologous to the virtual protein encoded by the pseudogene. The pseudogenization event occurred sometime between the divergence of bonobos and chimpanzees from the human lineage and the arrival of Denisovans and Neandertals. The pseudogene is due to a change in a single nucleotide in the codon for the penultimate amino acid, i.e. glutamine, in the signal sequence, resulting in a stop codon.

The park takes its name from the mythological Thunderbird of Indigenous North American cultures which is depicted on many totem poles. Also in the park are St. Anne's Schoolhouse (built 1844), Helmcken House (built in 1852 by Dr. John Helmcken), and Mungo Martin House (Wawadit'la), a traditional Kwakwaka'wakw \\"big house\\" built in 1953 by Kwakwaka'wakw Chief Mungo Martin. The park is part of the Royal BC Museum Cultural Precinct, an area around the museum that contains a number of historical sites and monuments. History Totem poles were first erected on the site in 1940 as part of a conservation effort to preserve some of the region's rapidly deteriorating Aboriginal art. The site was opened as Thunderbird Park in 1941. By 1951, many of the poles had greatly decayed, and in 1952 the Royal BC Museum began a restoration program with Chief Martin as its head carver. Martin died in 1962 and was succeeded by renowned carver Henry Hunt. Other artists who have worked as part of the program include Henry Hunt's sons Richard Hunt and Tony Hunt, Tim Paul, Lawrence Bell, David Gladstone, David Martin, and Bill Reid.

Baird was most notable and influential in calling for the liberalising of abortion. In his delivery of the Sandoz lecture in November 1961, titled the Fifth Freedom, he advocated for freedom from the tyranny of fertility. Career Baird was born in Greenock on 16 November 1899 to David Baird, head of the science department at Greenock Academy, and his wife May. He studied science and medicine at the University of Glasgow, graduating with an MB ChB in 1922 and went on to receive an MD with honours. His early experiences attending births in the Glasgow slums and in the city's Royal Maternity Hospital shaped his interest in the social and economic influences on the health of women, their babies, and across generations. He was awarded Fellowship of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in 1935. He moved to Aberdeen in 1936 as Regius Professor of Midwifery at the University of Aberdeen. During the next three decades, his main interests were in the areas of clinical practice, service provision and health policy in reproductive health, perinatal and maternal mortality, social obstetrics, sterilisation, induced abortion, and cervical screening. With his wife Lady Matilda Deans Baird, also a physician, Baird established the first free family planning clinic in Aberdeen. In 1951 he set up the Aberdeen Maternity and Neonatal Databank, which continues today to link all the obstetric and fertility-related events occurring to women from a defined population. Baird formally retired in 1965. He died on 7 November 1986. Family Baird and his wife had four children, two daughters and two sons. Their daughter, Joyce Baird worked as a doctor specialising in diabetes at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh. Their son Professor D.T. Baird, was instrumental in gaining approval for the use of RU-486 in the UK as an emergency contraceptive or 'morning after pill'. Their son, D. Euan Baird, retired as CEO and Chairman of the Board of Schlumberger Ltd. in 2003, after a long career with company. Awards and honours In 1966, the Freedom of the City of Aberdeen was conferred on Baird and his wife for their contribution to medical science and health in the City and beyond. He received an honorary doctorate from the University of Stirling in 1974. The antenatal clinic at Foresterhill had been named after him in 1970. The Dugald Baird Centre for Research on Women's Health at Aberdeen Maternity Hospital is named in his honour. He and his wife are commemorated by plaques at 38 Albyn Place, Aberdeen. The Baird Family Hospital due to open in Aberdeen in 2020 is named for him, his wife, their daughter Joyce and son David, in recognition of the medical contributions they have all made in Scotland and to the profession. The hospital will offer maternity, gynaecology, breast screening and breast surgery services, as well as a neonatal unit, a centre for reproductive medicine, an operating theatre suite and teaching facilities.

Altman's Fifth Avenue store, now used by the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and Oxford University Press Sixth Avenue in the Ladies' Mile shopping district B. Altman and Company was a luxury department store and chain, founded in 1865 in New York City, New York, by Benjamin Altman. Its flagship store, the B. Altman and Company Building at Fifth Avenue and 34th Street in Midtown Manhattan, operated from 1906 until the company closed the store at the end of 1989. Branch stores were all shuttered by the end of January 1990. One of the first American department stores to open out- of-town branches, Altman's eventually opened locations in Pennsylvania (St. Davids in 1965 and Willow Grove in 1983), New Jersey (Short Hills in 1958‚Äîreplacing an earlier nearby East Orange store‚Äîand Ridgewood/Paramus in 1967); and New York state (Manhasset in 1947 and White Plains in 1930). A short-lived location in Cincinnati, Ohio, opened during the L.J. Hooker ownership period (1987-1989), and two mall locations in Buffalo and Syracuse, New York, were physically completed but never occupied by Altman's during that same time.  History  The store that would become B. Altman and Company began on Manhattan's Lower East Side as a family-owned store, which by 1865 had come to be solely owned by Benjamin Altman, one of the brothers in the family, and was located at Third Avenue and 10th Street. In 1877, the store, wanting to expand, relocated to 621 Sixth Avenue between 18th and 19th Streets. This neo-Grec building was put up in four stages, and was designed by David and John Jardine (the original building, 1876‚Äì77, and the 1880 extension), William Hume (1887) and Buchman & Fox (1909-1910). By 1906, though, Altman's had moved to its new block-long B. Altman and Company Building running from 34th to 35th Streets, which was expanded in stages through 1913 to 188-89 Madison Avenue. The original Fifth Avenue building and the extensions were all designed by Trowbridge & Livingston in Italian Renaissance style. Altman's was the first big department store to make the move from the \\"Ladies' Mile\\" shopping district, where the dry-goods emporia had been located, to Fifth Avenue. That neighborhood was still almost entirely residential at the time, and the design of the new building, across the street from the grand residence of department-store rival A. T. Stewart's and diagonally across the avenue from the residence of Mrs. Astor, was planned to fit in with these palatial mansions around it. Following Altman's example, other big stores made the move uptown, such as Lord & Taylor, which moved to another Fifth Avenue building in 1914. In the 1930s, Altman's made one of the early entries in the suburbs, with branches opening in East Orange (later relocated to Short Hills), White Plains and Manhasset. The foresight of the organization in geographical selection can be seen in that the Short Hills location is now The Mall at Short Hills, the White Plains location is now The Westchester shopping mall, and the Manhasset location is adjacent to the Americana Manhasset, which opened nine years after the Altman's store.

After Altman's death When Benjamin Altman died in 1913 at the age of 73, his stock in the stores was placed in the Altman Foundation. Altman's art collection, which included many Rembrandts, went to New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 1986, due to changing IRS rulings, the foundation sold the stores to an investor group that included members of the Gucci family and two principals from financial firm Deloitte & Touche. In 1987, Australian real estate development company L.J. Hooker and its chief executive officer, George Herscu, purchased the controlling interest in the B. Altman stores (as well as Bonwit Teller, Sakowitz and a majority of Parisian). Hooker used these chains as anchors in poorly located, yet extravagant, new shopping centers across the country. With Hooker and Herscu knowing virtually nothing about how to operate these various retail chains, and then placing them in locations with no regard for market recognition or demographics, their strategy failed miserably, and in August 1989 B. Altman filed for bankruptcy protection, with the last store closing in 1990. The suburban Buffalo location at the huge Walden Galleria complex was, in fact, fully completed and fixtured but never occupied by Altman's. It would later be occupied in 1991 by local department store AM&A;'s and eventually a Bon-Ton, which vacated in 2006. This former never-opened Altman's location was demolished for a new cinema complex and mall expansion. The Carousel Center Mall location in Syracuse was under construction at the time and redesigned to house a succession of several discount anchors, one on each of the two floors. The store had a reputation for gentility and conservatism. It was regarded as similar to Marshall Field & Company in Chicago. Highlighting its sober reputation, the stores included a satellite location of Colonial Williamsburg's Craft House that sold classic colonial reproductions. Two lost treasures from the store are the famous Christmas windows, which rivaled those in the Lord & Taylor Building, a few blocks up Fifth Avenue, as well as the Charleston Gardens restaurant, which housed a full-sized facade of a Tara-like Charleston home. The St. David's location also had a Charleston Garden restaurant, as did the other branch stores. Buildings On March 12, 1985, Altman's Fifth Avenue building was designated a New York City landmark. When Altman's closed, the building stood vacant until 1996, when the exterior was restored by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer and the interior reconfigured by Gwathmey Siegel & Associates. The Fifth Avenue side was used by the City University of New York's Graduate Center, while the Madison Avenue side was used by the New York Public Library's Science, Industry and Business Library and by Oxford University Press. In addition, Altman's Sixth Avenue building is part of the Ladies' Mile Historic District created in 1989. In popular culture The Manhattan B. Altman store featured in the storyline of the 2017 Amazon Studios television series The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, in which the main character, Midge Maisel, takes a job on the shop floor. Exterior scenes were filmed at the store's former Fifth Avenue building, while interior scenes were shot in a disused bank in Brooklyn.

The Italian medieval feminine name originated in Tuscany, and is particular to Florence, Italy. Though similar in pronunciation to the Italian name Giovanna, and conjectured to be derived from it, Vanna is neither a nickname nor a derivation.  History  The name Vanna first appears in print in La Vita Nuova, a thirteenth-century book of verse written by Dante Alighieri, an Italian Florentine poet. In one verse, Dante writes that (anthropomorphized) Love itself proclaims that Vanna is Primavera (\\"Springtime\\") and declares that Beatrice's name is \\"Love\\".The Romance of Biography - Vol. 1, Jameson; E Monna Vanna e Monna Bice poi Vanna is also a Cambodian unisex name meaning \\"Gold\\". It originates from ancient Sanskrit. Cambodian names are chosen for various themes such as Nature and positive attributes.Cambodian names The beauty and significance of Cambodian names  Variations  Vannetta; Vanetta; Vannina; Vanni, similar to the first name Ivanna.  Meanings and usage  The name Vanna is particular to the Tuscan province of Italy where usage originated during the Renaissance and became popular as a feminine first given name. Vanna is the feminine root form of Giovanni, the Italian cognate of John, meaning \\"God is gracious\\". An Italian variant that closely resembles the name but was a family name and not in usage as a first or given name is the rare surname vanno, from ancient Latin meaning \\"she who sifts\\" (or \\"assesses\\") and \\"merit\\". Vanna is a Cambodian given name to either females or males and means \\"golden\\" and \\"golden colored\\". In Hebrew, Vanna means \\"God's gift\\". The Russian and Czech variation Ivanna means \\"God is gracious\\". Van is short for the Scottish variation Evan, meaning \\"Youth\\" and \\"God's grace\\". The Italian Name day is July 23, in memory of the Blessed Vanna of Orvieto, who died in 1306.

The Endowment House was an early building used by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) to administer temple ordinances in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory. From the construction of the Council House in 1852, Salt Lake City's first public building, until the construction of the Endowment House, the members of the LDS Church used the top floor of the Council House for administering temple ordinances. When this arrangement proved impractical, Brigham Young directed Truman O. Angell, architect of the Salt Lake Temple, to design a temporary temple. Completed in 1855, the building was dedicated by Heber C. Kimball and came to be called the Endowment House after the endowment ceremonies that were conducted inside it. Appearance The Endowment House stood on the northwest corner of Temple Square. Initially, it was a two-story adobe building, , with a single-story extension on its north side. In 1856, another extension was added on its south side and a baptistry on its west side. Inside, the Endowment House was the first building designed specifically for administering temple ordinances. Earlier buildings used for such purposes‚Äîsuch as Joseph Smith‚Äôs Red Brick Store in Nauvoo; the Nauvoo Temple; and the Council House‚Äîonly had temporary canvas partitions. The Endowment House had the typical ordinance rooms found in some later temples: a creation room; a garden room; a world room; a celestial room; and sealing rooms. In 1856, William Ward painted the walls of the creation room to represent the Garden of Eden, the first such temple mural. It was one of the first buildings in Utah to have indoor bathrooms. Uses The Endowment House was used primarily for performing temple ordinances. From 1857 to 1876 the baptismal font was used to perform 134,053 baptisms for the dead. Between 1855 and 1884 54,170 persons received their washings and anointings and endowments. Between 1855 and 1889 68,767 couples were sealed in marriage‚Äî31,052 for the living and 37,715 for the dead. Members of the LDS Church did not consider the Endowment House a temple, so they did not perform all temple ordinances in it. Brigham Young explained, \\"We can, at the present time [1874], go into the Endowment House and be baptized for our dead, receive our washings and anointings, etc. ... We also have the privilege of sealing women to men without a Temple ... but when we come to other sealing ordinances, ordinances pertaining to the holy Priesthood, to connect the chain of the Priesthood from father Adam until now, by sealing children to their parents, being sealed for our forefathers, etc., they cannot be done without a temple\\".Journal of Discourses 16:185. Hence, there were no sealing of children nor endowments for the dead performed in the Endowment House. These ordinances were first administered in Utah's first temple, in St. George, in 1877. The Endowment House was also used for other purposes, including prayer circles, settings apart, and instructing missionaries before their departure, as well as meetings of the various church leaders, such as the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Demolition The Endowment House became a casualty of the anti-polygamy campaign of the U.S. Federal Government, especially the Edmunds‚ÄìTucker Act of 1887, which disincorporated the LDS Church and allowed the federal government to seize all of its assets. In response, church leaders ceased performing new plural marriages. In October 1889, Wilford Woodruff, President of the Church, heard that an unauthorized sealing had occurred in the Endowment House. Woodruff ordered the building razed in October 1889. The Salt Lake Tribune, in its issue dated November 17, 1889, reported that the building was \\"being demolished\\". By the end of the month all trace of the Endowment House was gone. Some two years later, Woodruff issued the 1890 Manifesto, officially ending the Mormon practice of polygamy, which had been so firmly associated in the mind of the public with the Endowment House. Other Endowment Houses Building currently known as the \\"Endowment House\\", Spring City, Utah. The Endowment House at Salt Lake City may not have been the only non-temple structure used for administering temple ordinances in Utah.Allen D. Roberts, \\"The 'Other' Endowment House,\\" Sunstone 11 (July‚ÄìAugust, 1978): 9-10. One of these is a building known as the \\"Endowment House\\" in Spring City, Utah, built by Orson Hyde.

He was Member of Parliament (MP) for the Easington constituency from 1970 until his retirement in 1987. Described as an \\"old- style centre-right socialist\\", Dormand was a working-class child who progressed through grammar school education to study at Oxford and Harvard to a career as an educational administrator before entering Parliament at the age 50, where he was noted as an advocate for education and for mining areas. He never achieved ministerial office, but as a skilled administrator he played a significant role as a government whip in the 1970s, and as Chair of the Parliamentary Labour Party when the party was in opposition in the 1980s. An atheist and a staunch republican, he reluctantly accepted a life peerage when he retired from the House of Commons and was an active working peer until his death 16 years later.  Early life  Dormand was born near Easington at the workingmen's club in the village of Haswell, when his father Bernard, a former miner, was steward. He was educated locally at Wellfield Grammar School. Although he later took up rugby, he was a skilled footballer in his youth, good enough to have professional trials with both Manchester United and Charlton Athletic. Sport remained a major part of his life; until his death he remained a member Houghton-le-Spring Rugby Club and of Burnmoor Cricket Club, last playing both games at the age of 63. After training as a teacher at Bede College, Durham University, he was not called up for military service during World War II, because teaching was a reserved occupation. After the war he improved his qualifications by taking a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) at Loughborough College in 1947. In the 1950s he studied at St Peter's College, Oxford, where he was awarded a diploma in public and social administration with distinction and won a Fulbright Scholarship to Harvard in his second year (1954), becoming a friend of the future Senator Ted Kennedy. From 1940 to 1948 Dormand worked as a teacher in the coal mining community of Easington, teaching at Hordern Modern School and his old school, now renamed Wellfield A.J. Dawson Grammar School.Andrew Roth, \\"Parliamentary Profiles A-D\\" (Parliamentary Profile Services Ltd, 1984), p. 169-170. In 1948, he gave up teaching to become an education advisor to Durham County Council, and in 1957 moved to be adviser to the National Coal Board. He stayed with the NCB for only two years before returning to Durham to be Further Education organiser; from 1963 to 1970 he was Director of Education for Easington Rural District Council. He was also the President of the Easington branch of the National Union of Teachers.  Political career  Dormand had been a member of the Labour Party since the age of 18. He was elected to Haswell parish council at the age of 26, and at 30 to Easington rural district council. Manny Shinwell, the then 85-year-old veteran Labour Member of Parliament (MP) for the Easington constituency, announced in 1969 that he would not contest the next general election. Dormand, who had been secretary of the Easington Constituency Labour Party throughout the 1960s and Shinwell's presumed successor, was selected as the new Labour candidate to contest the ultra-safe seat (Shinwell had been re-elected in 1966 with over 80% of the votes). At the 1970 general election in which Harold Wilson's Labour government was defeated, Dormand was returned to the House of Commons with a barely reduced 79.8% share of the vote. = Education = His maiden speech on 8 July 1970 focused on education and on the needs of Durham as an \\"excepted district\\", and in particular on those classed as \\"slow learners\\". It was well received, and the then Secretary of State for Education Margaret Thatcher was seen to be making notes. Dormand's views on education were supportive of comprehensive education, and in July 1973 he urged the abolition of private schools (attacking particularly those Labour MPs who sent their children to be educated privately). Dormand opposed Britain's membership of the European Economic Community (EEC), and at the time of the referendum on EEC membership in 1975 he was an advocate for the United Kingdom leaving the EEC and rejoining the European Free Trade Association. His main work in opposition was as a member of select committee on nationalised industries, where his knowledge and inquisitorial skills won him the respect of the committee's left-wing chair Ian Mikardo. In February 1972 he called for employment for miners who had been made redundant, and became Secretary of the Parliamentary Labour Party's Northern Group in 1973. = Republicanism = Dormand later described himself as \\"a republican for as long as I can remember having an interest in politics\\" and was a long-serving secretary of the all-party Parliamentary republican group. He spoke out in opposition to the monarchy, declaring in 1971 that \\"the whole of the royal establishment from the Queen downwards could go, lock stock and barrel tomorrow\\". He extended his criticism to the hereditary peerage in February 1973. In 1974 he and fellow Labour MP Willie Hamilton took the required oath declaring their allegiance to the Queen, then admitted that they had not meant it. The same year, he criticised the number of Royal servants who appeared on the biannual honours lists, calling instead for \\"scores of miners\\" to be honoured as they were just as worthy.\\"Labour MP wants miners in the honours list\\", The Times, 30 January 1974, p. 7.  Government whip  Labour was returned to government at the February 1974 general election, and Dormand was appointed as an assistant government whip under Bob Mellish. He was promoted to be a Lord of the Treasury (full Government whip) in a reshuffle after the October election.David Butler and Gareth Butler, \\"Twentieth Century British Political Facts\\" (Palgrave Macmillan, 2000), p. 37. The post of a Whip normally required silence in the chamber of the House of Commons, but in February 1976 Dormand was involved in a difficult situation which required him to give an explanation. The Conservative opposition had called a vote censuring the Secretary of State for Industry Eric Varley by reducing his salary to ¬£1,000. Dormand was appointed as one of the tellers to count the vote, but both he and his Conservative opposite number miscounted and lost the true count. When Mellish announced the confusion to the Speaker, the Speaker agreed to hold another vote. Embarrassingly for Dormand, many Labour MPs had not stayed to hear the result and were no longer present, resulting in the Conservatives winning the vote by a majority of five.\\"'Not a true vote'-Government Chief Whip\\", The Times, 12 February 1976, p. 6. The Government decided that the result was not a true indication of the House's opinion and overturned the vote a few days later. When James Callaghan succeeded Wilson as Prime Minister in 1976, Mellish resigned and was replaced by Michael Cocks, and Dormand was promoted within the Whip's office to be the pairing whip, a job which involved co-ordinating agreed absences by MPs from one party with those of another so that the outcome of parliamentary votes is not affected. The Home Secretary Merlyn Rees had urged Callaghan to appoint Dormand as Chief Whip rather than Michael Cocks. The role of the pairing whip remained a crucial one as the government's slim majority turned to a minority through defeats at by- elections, and Dormand was credited with a central role in helping the government stay in office, telling Wilson that he was too \\"bloody knackered at the end of the day\\" to record the events surrounding the late-night votes. In January 1978 Dormand was named in a report by the Serjeant-at-Arms as having assisted in blocking one of the Division lobbies in an attempt to prevent a vote on part of the Government's legislation to devolve power to Scotland.Michael Hatfield, \\"Ministers plan moves to salvage Scotland Bill as Tories prepare for battle in the Lords\\", The Times, 28 January 1978, p. 2. On free votes he did not always help the Government. In July 1977, Dormand voted against the European Assembly Elections Bill which brought in direct elections to the European Parliament.Michael Hatfield, \\"Six Cabinet ministers among vote rebels\\", The Times, 8 July 1977, p. 1.  In opposition  When Labour lost the 1979 general election, Dormand served for two years as an opposition whip. He was an active opposition frontbencher who was particularly vocal in criticising the effects of the Thatcher government's economic policy on the manufacturing industry of the Northern region: in June 1980 he said that the policies were \\"crucifying\\" the region and it was \\"becoming a scene of devastation\\".\\"PM refuses to tax more, borrow more or print more money\\", The Times, 27 June 1980, p. 14. He specifically called on Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir Geoffrey Howe to abandon monetarism.\\"Chancellor says he is following same monetary policy as his predecessor\\", The Times, 7 November 1980, p. 9. = Parliamentary Labour Party chair = In the 1970s, Dormand had opposed left-wing infiltration into the Labour Party, and in foreign affairs, he was pro-American and pro-NATO at a time when the party's left-wing was becoming increasingly hostile to both. In October 1981, Dormand stood for the vacant position of Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, supported by the centre-Right Manifesto Group of Labour MPs. The strength of the left-wing in the Constituency Labour Parties at the time had spurred the Manifesto group to improve its organisation, and Dormand (nominated by former Prime Minister James Callaghan)Philip Webster, \\"Foot asserts control over Labour NEC \\", The Times, 29 October 1981, p. 28. defeated the main challenger, left-wing MP Ian Mikardo by 102 votes to 65, and Mikardo then withdrew. The other three candidates were Harry Ewing (22 votes), Willie Hamilton (11 votes) and Frank Hooley (11 votes) but all withdrew so no second ballot was held.Philip Webster, \\"Ex-whip is new PLP chairman\\", The Times, 6 November 1981, p. 2. Dormand held the chairmanship until he retired from the House of Commons in 1987. Dormand had a difficult job in trying to unite a fractious Parliamentary party at a time when the Labour Party was growing unpopular. In November 1982, amidst rumours that a majority of Labour MPs wanted to replace party leader Michael Foot, Dormand gave a radio interview insisting that \\"I have absolutely no doubt whatever that the vast majority think that Michael Foot is the man for the job at the moment, and will take us into the next general election\\". In response, Foot's critics noted Dormand's use of the words \\"at the moment\\".Anthony Bevins, \\"MPs enraged by Foot's failure to unite party\\", The Times, 26 November 1982, p. 1. = Kingmaker for the Speaker = After the 1983 general election, Dormand played a key role in the accession to the Speakership of Bernard Weatherill, seconding his nomination for the post. Weatherill had been an opposition whip when Dormand had been working in the Government whip's office in the late 1970s, but had not been appointed to the Thatcher government; in supporting him, Dormand pointed out to Labour cheers that Weatherill \\"is his own man\\" and would \\"ensure that the rights of backbenchers were safeguarded\\".\\"Weatherill pledges to be faithful\\", The Times, 16 June 1983, p. 4. In July 1983 he worked with his Conservative opposite number Edward du Cann (Chairman of the 1922 Committee) to agree an increase in MPs' pay over that which the Government proposed.\\"Pay rises for MPs as they decide their own incomes policy to 1988\\", The Times, 21 July 1983, p. 4. Like most Labour MPs, Dormand opposed the decision of National Union of Mineworkers president Arthur Scargill to call a national strike in 1984 to 1985, but he supported the miners in the Durham coalfield when his local Easington Colliery and others joined the strike. He accused the Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of washing her hands of the dispute like \\"Pontius Pilate\\". Despite his age, he remained physically active. In the 1970s he had campaigned successfully for the establishment of a parliamentary gym, continued playing cricket and rugby until the age of 63, and cycled from the House of Commons to his flat near Millbank. The then Leader of the House of Commons, John Biffen, recounted how Dormand would \\"swathe himself in luminous strips\\" before setting off, and although he abandoned the bicycle in 1987, deterred by London's heavy traffic, he took up walking instead. = House of Lords = Labour leader Neil Kinnock was expected to ask him to be government chief whip if Labour won the 1987 general election, but Dormand thought it right to retire at the age of 67. His successor John Cummings was the first miner to become MP for the area. A staunch republican who deplored all forms of social privilege, including hereditary peerages, he accepted Kinnock's offer of a seat in the House of Lords with some reluctance, receiving a life peerage as Baron Dormand of Easington, of Easington in the County of Durham on 13 October 1987. However, once in the Lords he thrived, serving on numerous select committees, including education, trade and industry, and the liaison and procedure committees. He was also appointed as deputy chairman of the Teesside Development Corporation, whose of de-industrialised land included part of his former constituency. The Corporation was later condemned by Labour MP Ashok Kumar for having left a legacy of limited and \\"often inappropriate and threadbare development\\". His areas of expertise included the film industry and tourism, continuing the work he had begun in the Commons as chair of the all-party parliamentary tourism committee in seeking the promotion of tourism in previously overlooked parts of the United Kingdom. He was also a member of the select committee on committee structure of the House of Lords and its chairman at the end of 1991, and later became Labour Peer's Representative on the Shadow Cabinet. Dormand had been brought up a Christian, an allegiance which continued into adulthood, when he sat on the parochial church council. He described his adoption of atheism as the result of \\"some years of very considerable thought\\", and once freed from the fear of offending religious constituents, his atheism became more outspoken in the Lords; in July 2000 he called for the disestablishment of the Church of England. He helped form the All Party Humanist Group, and became Vice-President of the British Humanist Association. As a former teacher, he sought parity in schools for religions and humanism, seeking to have both described neutrally rather than propagated. After his death, Michael Turnbull, the former Bishop of Durham, wrote in The Times of how Dormand had pursued this and other causes \\"without prejudice\\" and with \\"a warm affection for others\\". He continued to live in Easington after leaving the Commons, but moved in 1991 to Clipsham, Rutland, to be closer to the House of Lords. He described the move as \\"traumatic\\", but remained active in the Lords until his death, pursuing his interests in education and continuing his opposition to the monarchy. Of some 20 Labour peers opposed to the monarchy, {{open access} Dormand was the most outspoken, asking the government in November 2001 \\"whether they will call a referendum on the abolition of the monarchy\\" (the Lord Chancellor's answer was \\"No, my Lords\\"), and asked in March 2003 for a Select Committee to consider the future of the Monarchy. He recovered from a double heart bypass in 2001, and received an honorary doctorate of letters in July 2003 from Loughborough University. His last contribution to the House of Lords debates was on 19 November 2003, when he criticised the situation of \\"having to borrow money from the state to undertake a degree course\\" as \\"a considerable deterrent to poorer families\\". The following week was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Laws by the University of Sunderland, taking the opportunity to repeat his criticism of funding for students by saying \\"it is very important that young people should not be prevented from going to university\\". That was Dormand's last visit to his native North-East. He went into hospital in Peterborough four days later, and died on 18 December 2003, aged 84. Tony Blair described him as \\"a life-long servant of the Labour Party\\"; When asked by a journalist to choose his own epitaph, the answer had been \\"he was a canny lad.\\" A care home in Peterlee is named after him.  Family  In 1963, Dormand married Doris Robinson (n√©e Pearson), a former teacher who survived him. He had one stepson, and one stepdaughter from Doris's previous marriage.
