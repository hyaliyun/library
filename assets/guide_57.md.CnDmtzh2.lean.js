A full motion racing simulator is a motion simulator that is purposed for racing, and must provide motion simulation in all six degrees of freedom, as defined by the aviation simulator industry many decades ago. The six degrees of freedom coincide with Earth physics, and are commonly referred to (in both aircraft, watercraft and other vehicles) as: * The three translational movements: Surge, sway and heave (front/back motion, side-to-side motion and up/down motion, respectively) * The three rotational movements: Roll, pitch, and yaw (rotation around the normal, transverse and longitudinal axes, respectively) Simulations of these six degrees of freedom are usually achieved by tilting of a motion base (also called Stewart platform) which also changes the drivers position relative to the Earth's gravity, giving the sensation of acceleration. In addition to the six degrees of freedom, it is also common to have force feedback in full motion racing simulators, most commonly in the steering wheel, but sometimes even in other controls as well. To create an even more immersive experience, full motion racing simulators are sometimes also combined with virtual reality headsets.  Definitions  To merely be called a motion racing simulator, the device in contrast only needs to have a motion simulation mechanism in at least 1 degree of freedom. However, any motion simulator with less than six degrees of freedom should not be referred to as full motion simulators. It should also be noted that the term \\"simulator\\" in this article does not refer to the simulation software or game, but rather the physical hardware device that the driver sits in.  DOF comparison  The number of DOFs determine what kind of car and racing type can be simulated. 2DOF or 3DOF simulators can be sufficient if simulation of yaw, under and oversteer is not important. Advantages of some 2DOF setup can be lower price, quick response times and high speed.How to choose a motion platform - Motion Systems 6DOF simulators can achieve yaw (turning), under and oversteer. Different types of simulators may be more suitable for different use cases. Examples of other use cases may include simulating a motorbike, skiing og horseriding. Arguably the two most common use cases are auto racing and flight simulators. * Car racing simulators require quick movements, and it is often acceptable to have a short range. A 2DOF seat mover is one example of a common setup. * Flight simulation requires wide angulations. Suitable setups may include 6 DOF models.FAQ #214: What kind of simulator for me?

Compatability  Not all games support full motion simulation. Features and compatibilities may also vary with different hardware and software setups.  Layout  Full motion racing simulators are usually manufactured from steel or aluminum with mounting mechanisms for car controls, such as: * A steering wheel * Pedals (usually a throttle, a brake and a clutch pedal) * Shifter (usually a H-Pattern, a floor mounted sequential and/or a paddle shifter) * Seat Ergonomics may also attempt to replicate the vehicle being simulated.  Different implementations of 6DOF  In motion simulation simulators, the cockpit or the occupant's seat is moved in coordination with a graphical output. Different examples of racing simulators with motion exist, some of which provide motion only to the driver's seat, and others that move the entire simulator cockpit including all car controls. Further differentiation exists regarding visual display technology and whether the simulators graphical output moves with, and stays relative to the sim, or is static and motionless. The SimCraft APEX6 GTS https://www.simcraft.com/full-motion- racing-simulator-race-engineering/ and Cruden https://www.cruden.com/motorsport-driving-simulators/ are examples of full motion racing simulators implemented in different ways, but both offer motion simulation on all 6 of the degrees of freedom. The Cruden system utilizes a Stewart Platform while SimCraft utilizes a proprietary \\"Physics based\\" approach with independent degrees of freedom.

The series was just one of a number of commissions made by LWT controller of drama Nick Elliott in 1991, following the announcement that both The Ruth Rendell Mysteries and Inspector Morse were to cease production. The first episode of the series finds Sterne moving back in with his mother, Rita (Doreen Mantle), after a messy divorce. Three episodes of the series were written by acclaimed writer Stanley Price. Despite good reception, in the light of both Inspector Morse and The Ruth Rendell Mysteries returning to the ITV schedules, a second series was never commissioned. In 2013, Kaye stated in an interview that he was grateful to have \\"his own series at 30\\", and explained how the series allowed him to break through into other television roles, as well as securing a leading West End role within six months of the programme's broadcast.

Many of its buildings are either registered on Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship heritage list, or part of Bydgoszcz local history.  Location  The street lies in the western part of the Old Town. It connects D≈Çuga street and Farna street, where stands Bydgoszcz cathedral, following along a north‚Äìsouth path. It is 150 m long. History Jezuicka street was laid out in the middle of the 14th century, when Bydgoszcz Old Town network was established. It ran in the western part of the city, connecting D≈Çuga Street and St. Martin and St. Nicholas Cathedral. Rescue archaeological works have revealed the presence in the street of fragments of brick dating back to the 15th century. The house at N¬∞4 still keeps preserved walls from this period, while foundations from the 17th century have been found at N¬∞5. The history of this part of the city is related to the Order of the Jesuits, which owned a majority of the dwellings located between today's Farna, Jezuicka, Nied≈∫wiedzia streets and the Old Market Square. In 1619, the Society of Jesus erected a monastery here and around 1640, the construction of two Jesuit buildings on the Market Square closed one side of this quadrangle area: * St Ignatius of Loyola Church (); * Jesuit College (). During the Swedish Invasions (1660), most of the buildings were burned down, and many others were emptied by their inhabitants before the plague. Properties were then managed by churches, monasteries and hospitals: they were then called tagged as Jesuit. In autumn 1657, visiting monarques John II Casimir and his wife, together with Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia, their dignitaries and courtiers, were housed in the Jesuit College and the Jesuit-owned houses nearby. On the first detailed plan of Bromberg, drawn in 1774 by Prussian geometer Greth, a number of empty plots are visible in Jezuicka Street: only existing houses were located in the central and western part of the street and in the eastern frontage (today's City Hall). Many tenements were erected in the last quarter of the 18th century, as shown on Lindner's map in 1800 and a city map of 1816. It has been reported that between 1772 and 1786, 99 new 2-storey houses were built in Bydgoszcz. From the cadastral plan of 1876, it appears that there are 19 tenements at Jezuicka street, of which 13 located on the western frontage, which survived till today. In the 1920s, the house numbering of the street was ordered back to the Polish system, while Polish and Jewish population, including several bakers and shoemakers, lived here. During the German occupation of Poland, the inhabitants of Jezuicka street were the first victims of the riots of the Old Town in the early days of Nazi occupation of Bydgoszcz. After World War II and for several decades, the street kept the character acquired from the middle of the 19th century. In 1979, a renovation work started in the area, so as to order the old buildings of the Old Town, leading in the 1990s to the overhaul of most of the tenements at Jezuicka Street. Today they house bookshops, restaurants, shops, art galleries and in particular: * The Association of friends of Bydgoszcz City () at N¬∞4 and 18; * The Bydgoszcz Scientific Society () at N¬∞4; * City Hall offices at N¬∞4a and 14. In the 2010, street pavement has been renewed, as part of the Revitalization Plan of Bydgoszcz. The street ca 1905 =Naming= Through history, the street bore the following names: * 16th century to first half of the 18th century, - Platea ecclesiastica (Latin, Church street), since the alley led from D≈Çuga street to the Cathedral; * 1800-1816, Pfarr Kirchenstra√üe (German, Parish Church Street); * 1840-1920, Neue Pfarrstra√üe (German, New Parish Street); * 1920-1939, Ulica Jezuicka (Jesuit street); * 1939-1945, Neue Pfarrstra√üe; * Since 1945, Ulica Jezuicka. Current namesake refers to the Society of Jesus, which erected in the area a monastery (1619), a church (1638) and a college (1648). The place was the most important educational and cultural institution in the 17th century in Bydgoszcz.  Main places and buildings  Jesuicka Street is one of the most beautiful buildings in the Old Town of Bydgoszcz. The old tenements, despite multiple reconstructions, boast Polish Baroque architecture features. Most edifices, however, date back to the 19th century: 20th century series of renovations partially depleted facade architectural details. The oldest and most distinctive building on Jezuicka Street houses today the City Hall (). Bydgoszcz City Hall, at N¬∞1 Registered on Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage list, N¬∞601359 Reg. A/783 (May 6, 1992)Za≈ÇƒÖcznik do uchwa≈Çy Nr XXXIV/601/13 Sejmiku Wojew√≥dztwa Kujawsko- Pomorskiego z dnia 20 maja 2013 r. 1644-1653 Neoclassical architecture The edifice was initially a Baroque architecture building housing the Jesuit College in Bydgoszcz. The institution was established by Bishop Kasper Dzia≈Çy≈Ñski and Jerzy Ossoli≈Ñski, Bydgoszcz Starostwo and Crown Chancellor. In the 17th century, there were apartments for Jesuits, a school with four to five classes, an alleyway adapted for school theater performances during school and church ceremonies, and a music hall for members of the school orchestra. Main construction works were carried out from 1644 to 1653, under the direction of Jesuit builder Wojciech Przyby≈Çkowicz. An expansion of the college was performed in 1696, thanks to funds donation made by Jan Stefan Komorowski, Malbork Regent, brother of Wojciech, then rector of Bydgoszcz Jesuit College (1689). Further constructions were carried out in the college between 1697 and 1709 under the direction of Wojciech G≈Çaznowicz, the last major reconstruction happening in 1726-1740. Jesuit college and St Ignatius of Loyola Church composed one of the most magnificent ensemble in Bydgoszcz. It struck less by the level of decoration than the quality of its various important guests: John II Casimir and his wife, together with Frederick William and his spouse in 1657, officers and generals of the Swedish and Russian armies during armed conflicts in the 17th and 18th centuries. After the Suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1773, the building was used as a Prussian Gymnasium. In the time of the Duchy of Warsaw, there was a Department of Primary School (1808-1812) and later a faculty (1812-1815) faculty. At that time, the school received the visit, among others, of Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, Tadeusz Czacki; Stefan Florian Garczy≈Ñski Polish poet and friend of Adam Mickiewicz studied there. After the Third Partition of Poland (1795), a Prussian royal gymnasium was set up in the building (1871). In 1879, the ensemble was purchased by the municipality and became the seat of the city hall. To fit its need, municipal authorities ordered a reconstruction in 1878, supervised by building counselor Wilhelm Lincke, and helped by chief mason Albert Rose and chief carpenter Heinrich Mautz (who designed in 1845 Buchholz's tannery). Works remodeled the facade and adapted interiors layout to the needs of office activities. The opening ceremony took place on December 19, 1879. As a result of the reconstructions made in 1697, 1702, and during the 19th century, the edifice has gradually lost its original Baroque architecture to display Neoclassical features. The two-storey construction is a brick, plastered edifice with basement. Some rooms are barrel vaulted. The Town Hall is the only preserved fragment of the former Jesuit complex. The monastery and the church have been demolished in 1940. From 1994 to 1996, a general refurbishment of the facility was carried out, including a modernization and expansion of the eastern wing. On April 19, 2017, a new town hall clock has been unveiled on the facade. On the walls of the building are placed several plaques commemorating: * On the northern side, the 600th anniversary of Bydgoszcz (1946); * On the eastern side, the anniversary of the liberation of the city from German occupation (1950).

The house was rebuilt in the 1770s-1780s, in the Polish baroque style, its address was then Neue Pfarrstra√üe 14. In 1899, it was closely linked to the neighboring house at N¬∞4, housing offices of the \\"Stadtbriefpost Hansa\\", a post office ran by Mrs Schwarz, a widow. At the end of WWII, the building, then nationalized, fell into disrepair. Renovation only occurred in 1980, as one of the first houses aimed by the city project of restoration of the Old Town. Since that time the building houses the Bydgoszcz Scientific Society, with a scientific library, a reading room, editorial offices, a conference hall and a studio. In the 1990s, moved there the Library of the History Department of Kazimierz Wielki University, the Department of Culture of the City Hall, the Office of the State Service for the Protection of Monuments (), and the Provincial and Municipal Office for the Protection of Monuments. The townhouse has two storey with an attic and eyelid dormers; its horseshoe-shape footprint has wings onto Jezuicka, Farna and Przyrzecze streets. The upper part of the house displays an 18th-century Polish Baroque style, a passageway with an 18th-century preserved courtyard and an open wooden gallery. Front elevation on Jezuicka street is adorned with medallion-shaped sgraffiti designed by Witold Wasik, representing five scientists and artists associated with Bydgoszcz and the region: Emil Warmi≈Ñski, Jan Kasprowicz, Jan ≈öniadecki, Jƒôdrzej ≈öniadecki and Leon Wycz√≥≈Çkowski.

This was the second oldest pharmacy of the city (the oldest is the pharmacy Under the golden eagle-, at the Old Market Place), but was disbanded in 1950. From 1915, there was also a Polish bookstore () run by bookkeeper and publisher Leon Pos≈Çuszny. In 2015, a plaque commemorating the Polish pharmacist Ignacy Rochon, shot by the Gestapo in 1939, has been unveiled at the tenement, after his grandson funded the renovation of the house in 2014.

The first known owner at the end of the 17th century is identified as Felicjan Grzybowski.From a Jesuit archivist, Kacper Niesiecki, who worked in Bydgoszcz college where he died in 1687 His widow, Regina Grzybowska sold the property in 1764 to the Rehberg family. The house was rebuilt in 1775 once Christian Wilhelm Schulz bought it. Until the end of the 18th century, owners were real estate agents, such as Jan Gottlieb Rump (1792), Jan Gabriel Oppermann (1793), and Jan Daniel Kranz, an auditor of the Office of Excise Tax. From the beginning of the 19th century till 1839, the owner was Frederick Wilhelm Kutzer, a tanner. After him, the new landlord was Luisa Adler, one of the most influential lady in the city during Prussian period. She was the widow of a counselor of Bydgoszcz regency and land owner (he possessed the area of G√≥rzyskowo district of Bydgoszcz), who changed his name to Adlershorst. One of her sons, Friedrich Wilhelm, was an architect who designed Bydgoszcz St Peter's and St Paul's Church on Plac Wolno≈õci. From 1842 to 1874, the house belonged to a metal craftsman, Fryderyk, related to Frederick Wilhelm Kutzer the tanner. Following landlords were: * Carl Reinhold Lange, inspector of the military hospital; * Julius Goldstein, a merchant; * the German loan fund till 1885. In 1899, a post office, \\"Stadtbriefpost Hansa\\", led by Mrs Schwarz, a widow established here. It used also the neighbouring house at N¬∞2 for office purposes. After the end of World War II, the house was taken over by the State Treasury and was intended for housing tenants. Between 1967 and 1969, the edifice was restored according to Stefan Klajbor's design, who also designed Bydgoszcz Pomeranian Philharmonic. In 1969, Bydgoszcz Scientific Society () moved there, together with facilities at N¬∞2. Today, the tenement also houses the Association of friends of Bydgoszcz City (). The townhouse is a two-storey building with an attic. The basement still keeps preserved Gothic vaults from the 15th century. Upper stories date back to the second half of the 18th century, following Polish Baroque architecture style. The front elevation displays an arched portal and two adorned shed dormers. Interiors are decorated with Gdansk-Flemish baroque style furniture.

Harding, the 29th President of the United States. Harding was named in honor of his grandfather; however, he did not use \\"Jr.\\" or the suffix \\"II\\" in his adult life. He was the first presidential father to outlive his son, and the second presidential father (after Nathaniel Fillmore) to live through his son's presidency. In his biography of Warren G. Harding, Charles L. Mee describes Tryon Harding as \\"a small, idle, shiftless, impractical, lazy, daydreaming, catnapping fellow whose eye was always on the main chance\\". Early life and military service Harding was born in Blooming Grove, Ohio, to Mary Anne (n√©e Crawford) and Charles Alexander Harding. Both his parents were born in Pennsylvania to old- stock American families, and he was named after his paternal grandfather, George Tryon Harding I. Harding was the third of ten children, of whom he and five sisters lived to adulthood. His father was a reasonably prosperous farmer, and was able to afford to send his son to school. Harding began his education at a private school run by his aunt, and then at the age of 14 progressed to Iberia College. He graduated in 1860 with a bachelor's degree, and then began teaching at a small school just outside of Mount Gilead, Ohio. Harding returned to school after a year, enrolling at the Ontario Academy. In 1863, Harding enlisted in the Union Army as a fifer in the 96th Ohio Infantry. However, he caught pleurisy soon afterward, and received a medical discharge a few weeks later without ever having left the state. After a period of recuperation at his parents' home, Harding re-enlisted as a drummer. His unit shipped out to Virginia in May 1864, where he was stationed at Fort Williams.Young (1997), p. 143 While on a furlough, he and two of his friends visited the White House in Washington, D.C., where they requested and received a meeting with President Abraham Lincoln. In August 1864, Harding was again taken ill, this time with typhoid fever. He received a second medical discharge two weeks later.Young (1997), p. 144 Later life After returning from the war, Harding resumed his teaching career and also began building a house, which was completed in 1865. In 1869, having grown tired of teaching, he began training as a physician, buying a set of second-hand medical books and accompanying the local doctor on his rounds. The following year, Harding attended a semester of medical school at Cleveland Homeopathic Hospital College, which allowed him to receive a licence to practice medicine from the Northwest Medical Society. He returned to the college in 1873 for an additional semester, after which he was granted his Doctorate of Medicine (M.D.). Harding practiced as a country doctor into his late 60s, but eventually lost interest in the profession. His earnings were rarely constant (often received in farm produce rather than cash), and he often had to rely on his wife's income as a midwife. In later life, he frequently borrowed money from family, including his children. At various times, Harding supplemented the income from his medical practice by buying and selling farm equipment, speculating on land, selling insurance, managing a hardware store, and farming, almost all of which he did unsuccessfully. Arguably his one successful investment was his purchase of a half-interest in a local newspaper, the Caledonia Argus.Young (1997), p. 146 When his son won the Republican Party's nomination at the 1920 presidential election, Harding received a surge of interest that lasted for several months. His Civil War service was trumpeted in his son's campaign, with photographs run showing him in his Grand Army of the Republic uniform. Harding gave interviews in which he incorrectly boasted that he would be the first man to see his son elected president,John Adams and Jesse Root Grant had also been alive when their sons John Quincy Adams and Ulysses S. Grant were elected president. Nathaniel Fillmore had been alive throughout his son Millard Fillmore's presidency, but Fillmore succeeded to office upon Zachary Taylor's death and was never elected president. and also proclaimed that he had \\"a few scores to settle\\". Reporters eventually tired of his arrogant manner and rambling anecdotes, although he re-entered the limelight after the president's death in office in 1923. Over the next few years, when his son's reputation diminished, Harding came to shun publicity. He died at Santa Ana, California, in November 1928, at the age of 85, outliving his son by 5 years.Young (1997), p. 147 Marriages and family Harding married Phoebe Dickerson on May 7, 1864. He had first met her at his aunt's school, and (despite already being a college graduate) later followed her to the Ontario Academy, where they became secretly engaged. They finally eloped just before Harding was due to ship off to Virginia, marrying in Galion, Ohio, at the home of the local Methodist minister. His wife's parents did not learn of their marriage until Harding returned from the war. Phoebe died in 1910, and Harding remarried on November 23, 1911, to Eudora Kelly Luvisi, a 43-year-old widow. They divorced in 1916, and on August 12, 1921, Harding married for a third time, to his office secretary, Alice Severns. They remained married until his death. Harding's second and third wives were both 26 years younger than he, making them even younger than his son Warren. Harding and his first wife had eight children together (three boys and five girls), born over a 14-year period. Six of the children, Warren, Charity, Mary, Daisy, George Tryon Harding II, and Caroline lived to adulthood. Two other children, Charles and Almira died young. Harding's oldest child, Warren Gamaliel Harding, became (in order) a state senator, Lieutenant Governor of Ohio, Senator from Ohio, and finally President of the United States. President Harding had a reasonably close relationship with his father, especially in his youth, and was grateful to him for providing a college education and teaching him the basics of the newspaper business.

History The house was designed by Archibald Simpson and constructed for Lachlan Mackintosh of Raigmore, a merchant who had returned from Calcutta, in about 1810. On Lachlan Mackintosh's death in 1845, the estate passed to Aeneas Mackintosh, his son. The site was requisitioned for military use in June 1940 during the Second World War: the house itself became the officers mess for the headquarters of No. 14 Group RAF in 1941; the Operations Centre of No. 14 Group RAF was housed there in three buildings (Operations Room, Filter Room and Communications Centre), which were partially buried for protection, in a similar way to buildings for No. 9 Group RAF at RAF Barton Hall, No. 10 Group RAF at RAF Box, No. 11 Group RAF at RAF Uxbridge, No. 12 Group RAF at RAF Watnall and No. 13 Group RAF at RAF Newcastle. Much of the remainder of the site was used to create an Emergency Hospital Service facility which evolved to become Raigmore Hospital. After No. 14 Group was disbanded in 1943, the house became the local headquarters for the Royal Auxiliary Air Force. Meanwhile, the filter room bunker was used by the Civil Defence Corps from 1958 and by the Royal Observer Corps from 1968; it was acquired by Highland Council for use as their emergency centre in 1988. The operations room bunker and the communications centre bunker have both been demolished since the war. The filter bunker is new classified as a Historic Listed Building. In 2016 the filter room bunker was put up for sale by the Highland Regional Council. It has moved into private hands and is now owned by CSP Partnership. Change of use planning permission has been applied for to allow part of the building to be developed as a private museum. The house itself was decommissioned in 1957 and demolished in 1965: that part of the site has since been redeveloped for housing.

It is also the site of the Bridgwater War Memorial History The site of King Square was previously occupied by Bridgwater Castle. It was laid out with large Georgian houses between 1770 and 1800. During the later part of the 17th century John Harvey developed the site of the castle. In 1721 the remains of the castle, the house and the land was sold to James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos who developed an industrial centre in the town and demolished the last of the buildings. Much of the site was built on in the 1720s to create the Georgian Castle Street. In 1734 Chandos sold the whole of the redevelopment area to Thomas Watts, who sold it the following year to John Anderton, whose descendants continued to clear old buildings and construct new ones. King Square was built between 1807 and 1814, with many of the buildings incorporating stone from the old castle, although further study would be needed to say how much of their cellars and foundations are in situ castle walls. In 2008, during sewer renovation work, a section of the curtain wall of the castle and a tunnel used to transport goods from the port were discovered. Architecture Bridgwater War Memorial is a Grade II* listed war memorial located on King Square. It was designed by John Angel in the mid-1920s.

It currently hangs in the Palazzo Barberini, Rome. It is one of many paintings where Gentileschi depicts herself. Beyond self-portraits, her allegorical and religious paintings often featured herself in different guises.  Attribution  The painting is generally accepted as being by Gentileschi but there have been some doubts cast. It was included in the catalogue raisonn√© by R. Ward Bissell, but the 2001 exhibition catalogue on the Artemisia and her father Orazio considers it to be done by the workshop of Simon Vouet. Later investigations have fallen firmly on the side of the painting being by Artemisia Gentileschi. In particular, Jesse M. Locker points to the similar clothing used, as well as the treatment of lace, used in other Artemisia paintings to make this decision.  Quality  The painting is in a poor condition. Locker notes that it \\"is poorly preserved, leaving the flesh tones, particularly in the face abraded and badly deteriorated.\\"  History  There is very little detail on the provenance of the painting. The earliest is can be traced with any certainty is to 1935, when the collection of Palazzo Barberini entered the governmental Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica.  Content  It is assumed that the sitter in the painting is the patron that commissioned it, but there is no evidence to support any clear identification. Artemisia's pose has led art historians to see the painting as a direct challenge to a viewer. Mary Garrard has interpreted this in the context of Artemisia's gender, i.e. a challenge to male artists of the time. This contention is made based on the shape of the painting hand, as this gesture in the 17th century represented a \\"challenge advanced by those confident in the strength of their abilities.\\" Locker continues the idea of the painting as a challenge, but situates it in the context of the literary and poetic culture of the times, where Gentileschi is challenging poets, \\"whose spoken paintings ... cannot rival her painted poems.\\"  References  Category:1630s paintings Category:Paintings by Artemisia Gentileschi Category:Self-portraits Category:Paintings about painting ","title":"Self-Portrait (Artemisia Gentileschi)"},{"id":"53928429","text":"Ollie Manninen (January 9, 1917 - January 7, 1999) was an American long- distance runner.

History  The first hammer forge was probably built in 1482 \\"Th√ºringen-Reporter dated 29 April 2012, mit Hinweis 1482 u. Schmiedesymposium. Retrieved 13 May 2013. on the River Ohra. In 1592 the mill was bought by Tobias Albrecht, since when it has been named after him. The works originally had three huge iron hammers which were raised by the motion of a water wheel. The mill made iron products such as scythes, sickles, ploughshares, lances and swords. Later, it also carried out copper processing; washbowls, washtubs, kettle drums, brewing implements, pots, cans and pans were made. The kettle drums, which were produced into the late 20th century, were made from a single piece of copper, forged under the tilt hammer and still set a standard today in terms of their sound. The Tobiashammer was owned by the Albrecht family until 1816 when they sold it. Thereafter its owners changed more often. From the mid-19th century the mill was significantly enlarged. A rolling mill and a second hammer mill was built. The office (Kontorhaus), built in 1882, now acts as a restaurant, the Hammerschenke. In 1972 the old, ruined hammer mill was bought from private owners by the Ohrdruf Steelworks. In 1983 the Tobiashammer was opened to the public as a demonstration mill.  Museum, technology and art The museum has five working trip hammers, a rolling mill, stamp mill and grinding workshop as well as furnaces. The mill is still driven by four water wheels. Since 1988 the Tobiashammer has also housed one of the largest steam engines in Europe: a twin, tandem, reversing, steam engine, built in 1920, with a total weight of 305 tonnes and a power output of 12,000 horsepower. It comes from the old Maxh√ºtte smeltery at Unterwellenborn and was decommissioned in 1985. The engine is fully working and is operated during guided tours. An annual event that has taken place since the museum‚Äôs opening in 1983 is the Blacksmiths‚Äô Symposium (Schmiede- Symposium). In 2009 it was entitled \\"Tribute to Fritz K√ºhn\\" and brought together ornamental metalsmiths from three continents. Over the years many well-known metalsmiths and metal sculptors have created their works of art here. Many still grace the outer areas of the museum site as part of its sculpture park, such as the gigantic, forged water lily by Alfred Habermann and Das Gesicht by R√ºdiger Roehl.

Route description Montana State Line, US 93 at Lost Trail Pass US 93 enters Montana from Idaho at Lost Trail Pass and travels north descending through the Bitterroot National Forest. The highway continues along the Lewis and Clark Trail into the Bitterroot Valley toward Missoula, passing through Darby and Hamilton. At Lolo, US 12 joins from the west and they run concurrently northeasterly for , where US 93 heads due north on Reserve Street in Missoula. US 93 then joins I-90 and runs concurrently westward for to Wye, where it heads north. The \\"Animals' Bridge\\" on the Flathead Indian Reservation is used by grizzly and black bears. From Wye, US 93 continues north through the Flathead Indian Reservation, where its signage includes the historic Salish and Kutenai names for towns, rivers, and streams. Portions of this section run along the National Bison Range. North of the reservation, US 93 traverses the western shore of Flathead Lake, the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River. North of the lake the highway runs through the cities of Kalispell and Whitefish, traveling through the Flathead National Forest and the Stillwater State Forest before reaching its terminus at the Canadian border near Eureka. The portion north of Hamilton travels through one of the most densely populated areas in Montana. This section also serves as a popular north‚Äìsouth connection between Yellowstone National Park and Glacier National Park. As a result, the road tends to become more congested between Hamilton and Whitefish. A popular bumper sticker in Montana reads, \\"Pray for me, I drive Hwy 93!\\" Total US 93 mileage in Montana as of 2013 is : from the Idaho line to Reserve Street in Missoula via corridor N-7 (C000007) (includes concurrency with US 12), via corridor N-92 (C000092) (Reserve Street), concurrent with I-90 and MT 200 (C000090), and from Wye to the Canadian border via corridor N-5 (C000005) (includes concurrency with MT 200). History The Lewis and Clark Expedition became the first white men to travel the future US 93 corridor between today's Lost Trail Pass and Lolo in 1805, and Lewis's detachment ventured further north to the future site of Missoula in 1806 on their way to explore the Marias River. When US 93 was established in 1926, the nature of the highway's construction in Montana's mixture of terrain around glacial lakes, through dense forests and over high mountains was a significant challenge given the construction techniques and equipment of the time. On completed sections, animal-vehicle accidents would prove to be a thorn in the side of traveler and engineer alike. Many stretches have been widened and straightened, or else rerouted in ongoing efforts to improve traffic safety and preserve animals at the same time. Some of the old sections are still in use today, including the original gravel routing from Lost Trail Pass to Sula v√≠a Gibbons Pass and Bitterroot-Bighorn Roads, and old paved sections from Darby to Hamilton, through Missoula via Brooks, Stephens, Orange and West Broadway Streets, through St. Ignatius, north of Ronan to north of Pablo, northeast of Elmo through Dayton, Political Hill Road south of Lakeside, Lakeside Boulevard north of Lakeside, Old US 93 S in Somers, Forest Hill Road north of Somers, and two sections between Whitefish and Eureka. US 93 is now four-lanes from Hamilton to Evaro, through Arlee, north of Ronan to the south edge of Polson, and north of Somers to the south edge of Whitefish (except a six-block section near the county courthouse in Kalispell). Significant animal conservation efforts have also been accomplished in several areas of the corridor from Hamilton to Missoula, and from Missoula to Polson (such as the Animal's Bridge north of Evaro pictured here.) Kalispell Bypass A new US 93 Alternate (US 93 Alt.) was built to bypass through traffic around downtown Kalispell, Montana, between 2010-2016. Currently, US 93 through Kalispell is Main Street and Sunset Boulevard, a arterial. Three segments of the bypass comprising a total of were completed and opened to traffic between 2010 and 2013. The remaining opened on October 28, 2016. The southwest segment of the bypass is currently only two lanes and is slated for expansion to four lanes with two additional grade-separated interchanges when funding permits. Major intersections US 93 does not maintain contiguous mileposts across Montana as US 2 does. The state road log defines US 93 over four sections as of the 2013 edition, as determined by the change in milepost numbers.

It has a rosette of leaves and a single green and white flower, leaning forward with a brown point on the end of the labellum. Description Pterostylis acuminata has a rosette of between three and six dark green, oblong leaves, each leaf long and wide. A single green and white flower is borne on a flowering spike high. The flowers are long, wide and lean forward or \\"nod\\". The dorsal sepal and petals are joined and curve forward forming a hood over the column. The tip of the hood is sharply pointed and brownish. There is a broad, bulging gap in the sinus between the lateral sepals and a large gap between the lateral sepals and petals. The lateral sepals have thread-like tips long. The labellum protrudes through the sinus and is long, about wide, curved, reddish-brown and pointed. Flowering occurs between March and May. Taxonomy and naming Pterostylis acuminata was first described in 1810 by Robert Brown and the description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The specific epithet (acuminata) is a Latin word meaning \\"sharpened\\" or \\"pointed\\".

E. K√∂chert shop in Vienna. A. E. K√∂chert (sometimes spelled Koechert) is one of the oldest jewellers in Austria, founded by Jakob Heinrich K√∂chert in 1814. It is a family business known as the ¬´Jeweler of the Emperors and Kings¬ª.  History  The Frenchman Emmanuel Piot√© (or Peyote) opened a goldsmith shop in Vienna in 1814, the same year the Congress of Vienna took place, giving a great visibility to the newly-founded shop. In 1819, Heinrich K√∂chert joined in as an associate (he was from a German family of carpenters), and married Piot√©'s step-sister. By 1827, the Prince Metternich was the most prestigious client of the goldsmith shop Piot√© and K√∂chert. When the emperor Francis II contracted Piot√© and K√∂chert to create a golden box for the ambassador, the shop became the first official jeweler to the King (¬´Kaiserlich-K√∂niglicher Hofjuwelier¬ª). The goldsmiths also made the 27-star crown for Empress Elisabeth of Austria (the ¬´Sisi Sterne¬ª) that launched a new fashion in Europe. Alexander Emmanuel K√∂chert was tasked in 1844 with adding pearls to the Imperial Crown of Austria. The shop was located in the Palais Pallavicini before it moved to Hoher Markt 15 in 1873 in a shop designed by Theophil Hansen. Piot√© retired in 1848 and K√∂chert became the sole owner. The royal crown of the Empress Elisabeth made by K√∂chert was stolen in 1998 by Gerald Blanchard, and recovered 9 years later in Winnipeg, Canada. In 2005 the company opened a new branch in Salzburg. In 2014, the K√∂chert family became a Henokiens association member. In 2017, the company celebrated its 200th anniversary.  Governance  A. E. K√∂chert is headed by Christoph and Florian K√∂chert. The founders of the dynasty have set up a rule that only two heirs could own the family business at any given time.  References  This article contains translated text from A. E.

Politics =Alternative for Germany= Weidel joined the Alternative for Germany (AfD) in October 2013. According to Weidel, she was first attracted to the party due to her opposition to the Euro. She was elected to the federal executive committee of the AfD in June 2015. In April 2017 she was elected co-Lead Candidate of the party. She is the first lesbian to serve as a lead candidate of her party. =Political positions= Religion Weidel has stated that AfD is \\"the only Christian party that still exists\\" in Germany.AfD Christian Weidel Immigration Weidel has criticized the immigration policies of Angela Merkel, stating that \\"the country will be destroyed through this immigration policy. Donald Trump said that Merkel is insane and I absolutely agree with that. It is a completely nonsensical form of politics that is being followed here\\". She has called for the German government to invest in \\"special economic zones\\" in the Middle East to encourage educated and skilled persons to remain in their home countries and avoid the possibility of brain drain, but also says she supports a \\"Canadian-style system\\" which would privilege skilled, over unskilled, immigrants. European Union Weidel supports continued German membership in the European Union; however, she has called for economically weak states, such as Greece, to leave. And, though supporting the EU, she also believes Germany should withdraw from the Euro single currency. LGBT issues Weidel has stated her opposition to discussion of sexuality prior to puberty saying that \\"I don‚Äôt want anyone with their gender idiocy or their early sexualisation classes coming near my children\\". She has also expressed her opposition to legalization of same-sex marriage, stating that she supports protection of the \\"traditional family\\" while also supporting \\"other lifestyles\\". She has said she supports civil partnership for gay and lesbian couples, noting she is a lesbian herself.AfD campaigns against homosexuals and transsexuals =Controversies=  TV show \\"political correctness\\" incident  In April 2017, Weidel railed against political correctness, claiming that it belonged in the \\"dustbin of history\\". In response, on 27 April, TV presenter Christian Ehring of the satire program extra 3 addressed this, saying \\"That‚Äôs right! Let‚Äôs put an end to political correctness. The Nazi slut is right. Was this incorrect enough? I hope so!\\" Weidel sued the channel seeking to forbid re-airing of the program, and on 17 May the Hamburg District Court ruled against her, stating that a public figure must stand against exaggerated criticism. Weidel disagreed with the decision and promised to bring it to the Oberlandesgericht (Higher Regional Court). As of September 2017, no further action had taken place. Illegal immigration incident A September 2017 report by Die Zeit claimed that Weidel had illegally hired a Syrian refugee to do housework at her home in Switzerland. The report also alleged that the asylum seeker did not have a written work contract, nor were there invoices for her work. Weidel responded in a tweet that the Die Zeit report was ‚Äúfake news‚Äù and ‚Äúfalse\\" and Weidel‚Äôs lawyer stated that Weidel had a Syrian stay at her home as a guest but not as a worker. Personal life Weidel is in a lesbian relationship with a female film producer from Sri Lanka, who lives in Einsiedeln, Schwyz, Switzerland. Weidel primarily lives in Berlin, but lives part-time in Einsiedeln. They have two adopted children.  Selected publications  * Das Rentensystem der Volksrepublik China.

Alternative spellings of Bacmeister which may be encountered in sources include Backmeister and Bacmeisterus. Lucas Bacmeister (1530-1608) is sometimes identified as Lucas Bacmeister the elder in order to differentiate him from his younger son, Lucas Bacmeister the younger (1570-1638) who was also a Lutheran Theologian of note.  Life  Lucas Bacmeister was born in L√ºneburg, a short distance inland/upriver from Hamburg. Johannes Bacmeister, his father, was a master brewer. His mother, born Anna L√ºbbing, also came from a prominent family in the town. In 1548 he enrolled at the Leucorea University in Wittenberg. In order to avoid the plague which was lingering in Wittenberg he moved again in 1552, this time to the court of King Christian of Denmark where he was employed till 1555 as a tutor to the king's children, the princes Magnus and Johann. In 1555 he returned to Wittenberg and resumed his own studies, obtaining a Magister degree in 1557. In 1558 he was accepted as an Adjunct to the Philosophy faculty and switched to the study of Jurisprudence and then Theology. In 1559 he relocated to Kolding where he was employed by the widowed Dorothea of Saxe-Lauenburg as court preacher. On the recommendation of Philip Melanchthon he then went on to Rostock where at Easter 1562 he took over the post of Superintendent, simultaneously also becoming a Teacher/Professor of Theology at the university. To validate his appointment as a professor he was required to achieve a doctorate, which he did in 1564. In 1574 he was in L√ºbeck on account of the Saliger Conflicts (\\"... wegen des Saligerschen Streites \\"). In 1581 the Protestant authorities (\\"evangelischen St√§nde\\") in Lower Austria appointed Bacmeister to lead a visitation during the course of which he examined the preaching in four synodical assemblies: for the Manhartisberg region in Horn, for the Wienerwald region in Schallaburg, for the \\"unter dem Wienerwald\\" region in Castle Rodaun and for the \\"unter dem Manhartsberg\\" region in Feldsberg and Enzersdorf. In the context of the intensification of the political tensions arising from the Reformation, the exercise can be seen as part of a larger push to counter the rise of Flacian fundamentalism. Later in 1581 he visited Bremen in connection with issues involving the Sacrament. (The city was experiencing intense rivalries between different interpretations of protestantism at this time.) 1582 found Bacmeister in G√ºstrow in connection with the Apologetics over the Book of Concord. Of particular significance for Mecklenburg church history was Bacmeister's \\"Bann\\", written for the Rostock church ministry, which retained canonical legal authority for a long time. Later he also controlled the final version of the Mecklenburg Church Ordinance of 1602, after its original author, David Chytraeus, left it incomplete when he died in 1600. Bacmeister had also produced, in 1577, the Rostock Hymnal which opened the way for Joachim Burmeister church music publications. Bacmeister's own hymn \\"Ach leue Her im h√∂chsten thron\\" appeared in 1565 during the depths of the Rostock plague outbreak.  Patriarch  Through the fecundity of his first marriage Lucas Bacmeister became the ancestor of some distinguished branches of the Bacmeister family, several of which continue to flourish. His first marriage took place in Kolding in 1560. His bride was Johanna Bording (1544‚Äì1584), the daughter of the Rostock Professor of Medicine Jacob Bording and his Avignon born wife, Francesca Negrone. This first marriage produced ten recorded sons and one daughter. These included the Hebrew scholar and Lutheran theologiamn Jacob Bacmeister (1562-1591), the medical professor Johann Bacmeister (1563-1631), the theologian Lucas Bacmeister the younger (1570-1638)) and the physician Matth√§us Bacmeister (1580-1626). Another son, Heinrich Bacmeister (1584‚Äì1628), became a lawyer and married Sara Dorothea Reiser (1599‚Äì1634) from L√ºbeck, becoming the progenitor of what became the W√ºrttemberg Bacmeister line. The daughter, Margaretha (1568‚Äì1641), married the L√ºbeck pastor Johann Stolterfoht, becoming the mother of Jacob Stolterfoht. After his first wife died Lucas Bacmeister married Katharina Beselin (1536‚Äì1593), widow of the Rostock municipal leader Johannes Herverden. When she died he married Anna Vischer (ca. 1560‚Äì1638) from Aalst in Flanders. As far as is known, however, the second and third marriages were childless.

Its approximate duration is 19‚Äì22 minutes.  History  On 15 April 1907 the last concert of the Christchurch International Exhibition 1906‚Äì1907 was held. After this Hill went to Hampden in the South Island for a vacation, where he began composing the quartet. According to the note on the manuscript, it was finished only four years later, on 26 August 1911. A non-final version premiered by Austral String Quartet two months earlier, on 1 July, in St. James' Hall, Sydney. This happened just a few weeks after the first performance of Hill's First Quartet (18 May 1911). The score was further revised by the composer, and the premier performance of the final version was held by the Austral String Quartet in Sydney on 6 September. On 31 October it was played by Francis Mowat Carter, the composer, Stephen Vost Janssen and Bryce Carter during a farewell concerto to Mowat Carter, as he was going to further his studies in Vienna.A review of the concert in The Sydney Morning Herald 1 November 1911 It is unknown how much of the quartet was written in 1907, but it appears that Hill was impelled to complete it when he felt there was a performing opportunity by the newly-established (1910) Austral String Quartet. Although the program uses a MƒÅori legend, none of the themes is indicated as an original MƒÅori melody (as it is in Hill's cantata Hinemoa, Violin Sonata No. 4 and String Quartet No. 1). It is unlikely that this quartet contain any direct reference to a specific MƒÅori tune, but certain characteristics of MƒÅori music can be found in the piece.  Program  Hill claims that the program of the quartet is based on a MƒÅori legend. It is provided by him as follows.This program was printed on the sleeve of the Austral String Quatet original LP. It can also be found in Lam's thesis and in Naxos booklet notes.  Structure  The quartet is outlayed in four movements corresponding to the four scenes of its program. :I. The Forest. Allegro agitato (G minor) ::a) The fight of the Crane and the Monster ::b) Rata enters the wood :II. The Dream. Adagio (A-flat major) :III. The Karakia (Scherzo).

She was a key figure in bringing Christianity into the country.  Biography  Andrews was born in Dickson, Tennessee. The work of J. M. McCaleb influenced her to work in Japan where she later established around eight Japanese congregations. Sometime after she was baptized at age 14, she wrote to McCaleb about coming to Japan and he gave her advice what schooling and training she would need to be successful. Andrews graduated from Dickson College, and took additional classes at other colleges before she went to Japan. Andrews landed in Tokyo in January 1916. Her first converts to Christianity were Oiki and her mother, both who later moved with her to Okitsu where they opened a kindergarten. Later, with donations from the United States, she helped build a church in Okitsu. When World War II broke out, she was first put into a camp, then was imprisoned in her house. While she was a prisoner of war, she contracted tuberculosis. Andrews was rescued by an American soldier in 1945. She returned to the US in 1945 and in 1949 came back to Japan. After WWII, she opened a home for Japanese widows. She later said she did not take the option to flee Japan during the war as it would have led to the decline and destruction of the churches. She founded a church in Numazu in 1954, during its postwar redevelopment. Andrews died from a stroke on September 17, 1961. Oiha, an orphan Andrews cared for, established her tomb, which is in Numazu.

The first of these was K√∏benhavns Husmoderforening (Copenhagen's Housewives Association) which was established in 1917. The author Thit Jensen was responsible for founding the Copenhagen association as we all the DDH. Over the years, the DDH became the country's largest organization for housewives, reaching a membership of some 10,000 by 2005. It later became known as Aktive Kvinder i Danmark but was dissolved in 2009. The organization set out to support, protect and promote the role of the home for practical, social and ethical purposes, recognizing above all the importance of housework carried out by women. The DDF and the associations it represented focused on mainly middle-class women in cities, in parallel to the rural women's household associations established for the farming community. Education, which became a major concern, led in 1934 to the establishment of Marthaforbundet (The Martha Federabtion) which offered a three-year theoretical and practical course in housekeeping for young women. The association was also instrumental in establishing a course in housekeeping at Aarhus University in 1945. The initial emphasis on the role of women in the home evolved in the 1960s when women increasingly entered the labour market. This later brought about changes in the name of the association, first in 1997 to DDH Forening af Aktive Kvinder (DDH Association of Active Women) and in 2001 to Aktive Kvinder i Danemark (Active Women in Denmark), the focus shifting to the part women played in public health, nutrition and childcare and as well as their social and economic responsibility for consumer issues. But as membership seriously declined, the association was dissolved in 2009.

He began his career as a tenor for operettas, but has developed into singing Heldentenor parts by Richard Wagner including Tristan, Siegmund, Siegfried and Parsifal. A member of the Staatsoper Berlin, he has appeared internationally at venues including La Scala, The Proms and the Bayreuth Festival.  Career  He was born Andreas Schagerl in Rohrbach an der G√∂lsen, Lower Austria. He was a singer of the Wiener Singakademie, and then studied voice at the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna with Walter Moore. He made his debut on stage as Ferrando in Mozart's Cos√¨ fan tutte at the Schlosstheater Sch√∂nbrunn. His first engagement was as an operetta tenor at the Theater Krefeld und M√∂nchengladbach. Schager sang lyrical tenor parts as a guest in Bologna, Frankfurt, Ghent, in Vienna, and at the Royal Opera Canada, including Tamino in Mozart's Die Zauberfl√∂te. He had developed into a singer of major Wagner roles by 2009, when he performed the part of David in Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg, also Florestan in Beethoven's Fidelio and Max in Weber's Der Freisch√ºtz. He appeared in the title role of Rienzi first in June 2011 at the Theater Meiningen, and as Siegfried at the Halle Opera in the 2011/12 season. He performed the parts of Tannh√§user, both Siegmund and Siegfried in Der Ring des Nibelungen, and Parsifal. He appeared as Tristan first at the Stadttheater Minden in 2012, alongside Dara Hobbs as Isolde, with the Nordwestdeutsche Philharmonie conducted by Frank Beermann in a staging by Matthias von Stegmann. A reviewer from Vienna called his performance a \\"sensation\\". She described him as looking and acting like a knight, and his voice as unbelievably powerful, used without straining it, but also without restraint during the three acts (\\"eine unwahrscheinlich kraftvolle Stimme, die unforciert drei Akte lang ohne Schonung eingesetzt wird\\"). She thinks that his high range, built upon a basis of a broad middle range, seems to be able to move mountains (\\"Auf einer breiten Mittellage-Basis baut er H√∂hen auf, die Berge versetzen k√∂nnten, meint man.). The performance was noticed internationally; reviewers noted the singers' intensity and authenticity, and described Schager's Tristan as a \\"boisterous, passionate firebrand and dare- devil, whose ego does not have space for self-doubt. At a performance of Siegfried at the Staatsoper Berlin conducted by Daniel Barenboim on 7 April 2013, Lance Ryan was scheduled to sing the part of Siegfried but failed to show up for Act I beginning in the afternoon. Schager, scheduled to sing Siegfried in G√∂tterd√§mmerung, was nearby rehearsing Die Zauberfl√∂te with the Berlin Philharmonic for a performance the same evening, and he agreed to Barenboim's request to sing the part of Siegfried from the wings while an assistant director appeared on stage in Ryan's costume. Ryan arrived in time for Act II. Schager appeared then as Siegfried in G√∂tterd√§mmerung, at the Staatsoper and also at The Proms and La Scala. Schager made his debut at the Bayreuth Festival in 2016 as Erik in Der fliegende Holl√§nder, and stepped in as Parsifal. He is scheduled to be Parsifal in 2017 and 2018. He appeared as Siegfried in a concert performance at the 2016 Spring Festival in Tokyo, conducted by Marek Janowski. He appeared in the two performances of the Ring Cycle of the Internationale Maifestspiele Wiesbaden, staged by Uwe Eric Laufenberg, as Siegfried, and on short notice also as Siegmund. A critic said she had rarely met a tenor that wild, untamed, freely flowing, blasting every high note with joy (\\"... einen so wilden, ungez√§hmten, sich verstr√∂menden, jeden hohen Ton mit Freude schmetternden Tenor selten geh√∂rt\\". She described him as a truly intelligent actor who is capable of great nuances (\\"... und daneben ein wirklich intelligenter Darsteller, der zu gro√üartigen Nuancierungen f√§hig ist\\"). Schager will make his Metropolitan Opera debut as Siegfried in 2019.

It was built in 1912. It is part of The Leading Hotels of the World. It features 171 rooms and 10 suites, with a total of 330 beds. History Anton Bon The history of Suvretta House dates back to the beginning of the 20th century when an English shipbuilder had the \\"Villa Suvretta\\" built for his wife by Swiss architect Karl Koller. However, his wife didn't like the villa, and he sold it to his friend, Charles Sydney Goldman, British Member of Parliament and businessman who had made a fortune trading in diamonds. Goldman admired the house and gradually bought 4.5 hectares of surrounding land. Goldman met Swiss hotelier Anton Bon, and both agreed on building a new hotel. The groundbreaking ceremony took place on 22 April 1911. The building was completed in December of the same year; the interior was created in 1912. The inauguration took place on December 16, 1912 with 200 invited guests. The hotel had 250 guest rooms, 370 beds, 110 bathrooms, rooms for bridge, billiards, smokers and tea drinkers, a library, a music room and a dining room. Following Anton Bon's death in 1915, his wife Maria took over the management of the hotel. In 1916, her son, Hans Bon (1882-1950) was appointed as the new director. The hotel is now owned by the seventh generation of the Bon family. In 1935, one of the first ski lifts in Switzerland was inaugurated at the Suvretta. It led from Suvretta to Randolins. Actor Douglas Fairbanks was the first person to use the lift. The lift made it possible to reach the Corviglia ski area directly from the hotel. In 1963, Suvretta House acquired additional land to protect downhill slopes from building developments. The hotel was closed from 1941 to 1946 as a result of WWII. Later, renovation work was carried out. Notable guests have included King Farouk of Egypt, Crown Prince Akihito, the Shah of Persia, Gregory Peck, and Evita Per√≥n.

It abolished the two university constituencies in D√°il √âireann. Background The University of Dublin (Trinity College Dublin) had been a constituency in the Irish House of Commons from 1613 to 1800 and in the United Kingdom House of Commons from 1801 to 1922. The National University of Ireland was a constituency in the UK House of Commons from 1918 to 1922. The Government of Ireland Act 1920 gave both universities four seats each in the Southern Ireland House of Commons. Article 27 of the Constitution of the Irish Free State provided: The Electoral Act 1923 required voters eligible to vote in university constituencies to choose to register in that constituency or in a geographical constituency. Change to the text The Amendment deleted Article 27 in its entirety and deleted references to university constituencies in Articles 26 and 28. It came into effect on the dissolution of the Oireachtas next following the Act, which occurred on 14 June 1937. The change to the electoral law was made by the Electoral (University Constituencies) Act 1936, transferring all those on the register for university constituencies to the register for geographical constituencies. Oireachtas debate The Constitution (Amendment No. 23) Bill 1934 passed Second Stage in the D√°il on 8 May 1934 by 58 to 34, and passed Final Stage on 5 July 1934 by 51 to 29. On 18 July 1934, it was defeated at Second Stage in Seanad √âireann by a vote of 15 to 30. On 6 February 1936, the D√°il passed a motion under Article 38A of the Constitution by a vote of 66 to 38 that the bill be sent again to the Seanad. On 26 February 1936, the Seanad passed an amendment to the bill, which would have delayed its effect until six months after the dissolution of the Oireachtas. On 23 April 1936, the D√°il passed a motion of enactment by 58 to 40 resolving that the bill be deemed to have passed both Houses. It was signed by the Governor-General the following day. Expiry The Amendment became obsolete on the repeal of the 1922 Constitution on the adoption of the Constitution of Ireland in 1937, and was repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 2016. Both the University of Dublin and the National University of Ireland were given three seats in new constituencies in Seanad √âireann established under the Constitution of Ireland adopted on 29 December 1937, with the first elections in 1938.

Now living in Brooklyn, New York, he is most well known for his play the living'life of the daughter mira, which won Arizona Theatre Company's 2015 National Latino Playwriting Award and was named one of the Best Unproduced Latin@ Plays 2017 by the 50 Playwrights Project., and so go the ghosts of mexico a three-play cycle about the US-Mexico drug wars.  Biography  Matthew Paul Olmos was born in Montebello, California and raised in South Pasadena, California by his parents, a police officer and Labor/Delivery nurse. He began writing in early high school, where he enjoyed rewriting lyrics to songs and thinking about their rhythm and poetry. Classmates would occasionally pay him to write poems for their girlfriends. Olmos transferred to University of California, Santa Barbara in his junior year, where he was drawn to acting and writing. Originally planning to write, direct and act in movies, Olmos was not exposed to theatre until his senior year of college when he took an Intro to Playwriting course. Olmos stayed an extra year and switched his major to receive a B.A in Playwriting, after his professor told him he had talent for playwriting. Olmos moved to Brooklyn, New York in 2001 to pursue playwriting. He received his M.F.A in Playwriting from the New School of Drama in 2004.  Career  Olmos's earlier productions include The Vampire Lesson and the beautifulest room produced by the Actor's Studio Repertory at Westbeth Theatre in New York and seal sings its song, Wonders of the Human Body, and locomotive produced by the Gene Frankel Theatre in New York City. Olmos co-founded woken'glacier theatre company where he served as Artistic Director. In 2009, his play i put the fear of m√©xico in'em, which was developed while he was in residency at INTAR theatre got him selected as a Sundance Institute Time Warner Storytelling Fellow. From 2009‚Äì2011, Olmos spent time in the Mabou Mines/Suite Resident Artist Program where, under the mentorship of Ruth Maleczech, he developed a piece titled The Nature of Captivity, which won top prize for the Americas in BBC's International Playwriting Competition. Olmos worked at the Lark Play Development Center before quitting to be a full-time playwright. In 2012, Olmos worked in residence at New Dramatists as part of his Princess Grace Fellowship. In 2013, Olmos was selected in the Ucross Foundation's Sundance Institute Theatre Program. In the same year, he received the inaugural Ellen Stewart Emerging Playwright Award. In 2015, Olmos was selected as a Baryshnikov Arts Center Resident Artist. = so go the ghosts of m√©xico = Sam Shepard selected Olmos to create an original work to be produced by La MaMa, e.t.c. as a result of receiving the Ellen Stewart Emerging Playwright Award. so go the ghosts of m√©xico, part one directed by Meiyin Wang premiered in April 2013 to positive reception. Based on Marisol Valles Garc√≠a, the \\"Bravest Woman in Mexico,\\" the play uses ghosts, a magic radio and other supernatural elements to give a poetic interpretation of the story of the 22-year-old woman who becomes chief of police after the previous chief of police is tortured and beheaded by the drug cartels. Olmos has stated that so go the ghosts of m√©xico is a three-play cycle that is thematically connected but each play features entirely different characters and circumstances. Part one's focus is on the political becoming personal. Part two hones in on the drug cartels themselves, but was played by an all-women cast as a critique on the machismo in that realm. Part three centers on U.S involvement. All three plays feature ghosts and a prominent use of music. In 2016, the Undermain Theatre, in Dallas, TX, committed to producing the entire cycle of plays over the course of three seasons, as announced in American Theatre. = Views on theatre = Olmos has said he believes there are two categories of theater: ‚Äú1. the type that ‚Äútheater people‚Äù buy tickets (or get comped) to see and 2. the type that we feel comfortable taking ‚Äònon-theater people‚Äô to see.‚Äù Olmos has issues with most theatre as being too pretentious and self-indulgent or lacking in substance. Theater is too \\"safe\\" of an art form and many groups simply put on shows that have audiences sit quietly for 90 minutes, then leave, which makes theatre irrelevant. Instead, Olmos hopes theatre allows itself to become more \\"relevant, dangerous and exciting,\\" where any non-theater person can enjoy and have an engaging experience. Olmos enjoys writing that takes risks and is not afraid to anger, challenge, confuse and engage an audience. Olmos thinks it is important to create theater that is important to the world that anyone can watch and to avoid \\"doing art for art's sake.\\" He enjoys the works of writers like Rogelio Martinez, Mando Alvarado, Caitlin Saylor Stephens, Samuel Hunter and companies like The Assembly and The TEAM.  Writing style  Many of Olmos' characters speak in a \\"stylized rhythm\\" based on how he hears Mexicans from the West Coast speak. When asked about his use of lower case and punctuation, Olmos has said that he has never been especially good with grammar and has a very small vocabulary, but he loves the endless ways people can communicate casually and tries to show that in his writing. Olmos focuses on writing about underrepresented, marginalized \\"have'nots.\\" According to him, the majority of works in theatre are about people with social class, which he finds elitist. Olmos only writes stories with political or social relevance, and often incorporates fantastical elements within them as a way to \\"embrace theatricality\\" and \\"expand our imaginations.\\" The fantastic elements in his worlds are also a way to approach the many ridiculous, unexplainable things people do to each other in the real world. Olmos hopes when writing about the underrepresented types of people that do not typically attend theater, that if they saw his play, they could connect through the theatrics or \\"hyper- realistic\\" elements in his work. Olmos likes to write about the small boundaries people create around themselves and often overlook. He finds that these boundaries that separate us and cause loneliness are ridiculous and that by writing about them we can recognize them and be able to look across them.

His films as director include the 1995 film Skin, starring Ewen Bremner, written by Sarah Kane, and his 2000 film, Beyond the Boundary, which won a British Academy Children's Award. His feature films as a writer include I.D. and ID2: Shadwell Army, other full-length films as writer including Sweet Nothing and Criminal, both for the BBC. Criminal won 1993 Best Single Drama at the Royal Television Society. Biography Vincent was born in North London and grew up in Basildon, Essex. He is a prominent interviewee in Christopher Smith's 2017 film about creativity and Basildon, New Town Utopia.http://film.britishcouncil.org/new-town-utopia He was educated at St Nicholas Comprehensive School, and went on to the University of York, where he studied English Literature and Philosophy. At York, he was very active in student drama, where he acted, directed and wrote his first plays. Several of these were successfully staged at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, and one, Mr Lovert's Occupation was subsequently performed in Belfast and Newcastle. In York, after graduating, he worked both as a stagehand at York Theatre Royal and Community Theatre Director at York Arts Centre. He continued to write, and was Director of York Community Theatre, writing and directing a number of large scale touring theatre shows. He went on to direct the Sheffield Street Show for Metro Theatre Company, performed by a company of over a hundred actors. He then moved to London, where he became a Script Associate at the Royal Court Theatre, and was a member of the Writer's Group there, writing and directing for their production of new short plays Shots In The Dark. O'Connell was a founder member of Loose Exchange Theatre Company,Drumgoole, Dominic (2001) The Full Room p59 writing a play Scarecrows which toured England with Arts Council assistance and ran for two months in London. He also wrote and directed in Improbabilities for the Loose Exchange residency at the Soho Poly Theatre (now the Soho Theatre). O'Connell wrote a play cycle Five Minute Warnings for Basildon Youth Theatre which opened the Helen Mirren Studio at the Towngate Theatre in his home town, and first met there a 17 year old actor called Sarah Kane, who became a lifelong friend. Vincent enlisted Kane as Assistant Director with Loose Exchange for their production at the Soho Poly, and she skipped off school to fulfil the role.Simon Hattenstone, A Sad Hurrah, Guardian 1 July 2000 While at the Royal Court O'Connell attracted interest from the BBC, where he was commissioned for a string of dramas. He also wrote a Channel 4 short film, Life's A Gas around this time. His first feature film commission, Vicious, was a collaboration with director Alan Clarke, but Alan became ill as the film was preparing for production, and he died in the summer of 1990. Sweet Nothing was O'Connell's first feature-length production with the BBC, broadcast as a 'Screen 1' in September 1990. It was dedicated to the memory of Alan Clarke, and won an Honorable Mention at the San Francisco Film Festival. Both Vicious and Sweet Nothing were developed with producer Louis Marks and script editor Paul Marcus. A string of BBC commissions followed, of which Criminal received a number of awards including Royal Television Society Best Single Drama in 1995. In the same year his feature film I.D. won a number of international film festival awards and was short-listed for Best Screenplay by the Writers' Guild of Great Britain. Concurrently with these developments in film work, Vincent was also involved in a number of innovative theatre projects. With Sarah Kane, who was now an undergraduate at Bristol University, he took two shows to Edinburgh in the summers of 1990 and 1991. Dreams, Screams and Silences and Dream/Screams 2 consisted of a series of short works written by O'Connell and monologues written by Sarah - her first publicly performed work. Throughout these years O'Connell was regularly employed in television script writing. O'Connell's first two short films as director were self-financed, and were distributed on the same reel as a package of two interlinked dramas. Conform and Deform constitute Sex Crimes, shot on 16mm and also written by O'Connell. The following year he directed Sarah Kane's script Skin, financed by Film 4, which was shortlisted for a Golden Bear at Berlin. He also made a number of no-budget experimental films, which he wrote, directed, shot and edited, including Living Space and Happy Hour. He wrote and directed the BBC-funded Schools Drama Beyond the Boundary, which won a BAFTA for Best Film in its category. Over recent years O'Connell has created and written a number of major commissioned TV series, none of which have made it into production. O'Connell has also written Rachman-Empire of Dirt, a feature film based on the very strange life of 1950s slum landlord Peter Rachman, which O'Connell is engaged to direct for Redspur Films. This was first developed by Paul Marcus, to be directed by him. O'Connell's recent work has included two radio dramas broadcast on BBC Radio 4 - Undivided Heart and Velvet Blackout.

She was the mother of his third son, Prince Rafi-ush-Shan, and exercised great influence over her husband. She was the grand mother of future Emperors, Rafi ud- Darajat, Shah Jahan II, and Muhammad Ibrahim. She died in 1701, six years before Bahadur Shah's accession to the throne. Family Born at Khurasan, Nur-un-Nissa Begum was the daughter of Mirza Sanjar Khan, who was said to be a descendant of Najm-e Sani. Her mother, Zinat-i-Alam was a greatniece of Mumtaz Mahal, wife of Shah Jahan.Muni Lal, Mini Mughals (1989), p. 26 She had a brother named Shakir Khan. Marriage She married Prince Muhammad Muazzam (future Bahadur Shah I) on 30 December 1659, after his return from Deccan to Delhi with Wazir Khan. The customary royal gifts were given to the bride and the bridegroom. In 1671, she gave birth to a son. Mirza Muahammad, an agent of Muazzam escorted the mother and son to Aurangzeb, who gave the baby the name of Rafi-ush-Shan. She was adorned with many commandable qualities. She had monopolized Muazzam's heart by her accomplishments. She composed Hindi verses, and was famous for her charites and helpfulness to the needy. She won her husband's heart by her excellent behavior, obedience, and attractiveness, and because of this his other wives were jealous of her. They had accused her of immorality and of being the cause of message between Abul Hasan Qutb Shah, the ruler of Golconda, and Muazzam, and other bad acts. And they filled Aurangzeb's years with their complaints. Muhammad Azam Shah's partisans, and Muazzam's enemies began to say that Nur-un-Nissa had gone to Golconda, and settled with Abul Hasan that if the emperor did not accept his appeal for peace with him, Muazzam would also join him. As a result, Muazzam was placed in confinement for seven years in the Deccan. Muazzam's sons, and Nur-un-Nissa were also imprisoned in separate jails. She was often insulted and rebuked by Aurangzeb's eunuchs. She was deprived of her liberty, her property was escheated, and her chief officer was tortured to make him reveal the suspected disloyal acts of Muazzam and Nur-un-Nissa. During this time Juliana Dias da Costa remained with her, and served as her maid. In 1693, both Nur-un-Nissa and Muazzam were released from imprison. In 1699, Muazzam was appointed the governor of Kabul, where Nur-un-Nissa accompanied him. During their stay at Kabul, Aurangzeb presented Muazzam, Amat-ul-Habib in order to spite Nur-un- Nissa. Amat-ul-Habib was mother of a son born in 1700 at Khairabad. Death Nur-un-Nissa Begum died at Kabul in February 1701. According to Niccolao Manucci, \\"she was in every way a most accomplished princess\\". Her death was a great affliction to both Muazzam and Rafi-ush-Shan. Aurangzeb, and all the courtiers came to them, and offered their condolences.

Description Ancistrocerus scoticus is not easy to distinguish from some sympatric congeners and is frequently misidentified as Ancistrocerus trimarginatus. In most of its range this species is mainly black with yellow tergal bands but in western Scotland and coastal Ireland these bands are coloured ivory-white. Distribution Ancistrocerus scoticus occurs throughout the Palearctic from Ireland south to northern Morocco east to Kamchatka, including Korea. In Britain it is scarce but widespread, although it is absent from the Shetland, the Channel Islands and much of Ireland. Habitat Ancistrocerus scoticus has a rather catholic choice of habitats and has been recorded in moorland, sandy areas such as lowland and coastal heaths, woodlands on clay and sandy soils, parkland, quarries (especially limestone and sandstone), calcareous grassland, gardens, coastal cliffs, wetlands, sand dunes and shingle. Biology In Britain Ancistrocerus scoticus is probably univoltine flying mainly from June to August, occasionally it has been recorded as early as May and as late as September, and very infrequently in April. The main prey consists of small caterpillars of butterflies and moths, but it will also take the grubs of chrysomelid beetles. It normally builds clay cells in hollow spaces such as crevices in rocks, cracks in man made stone structures, cavities among pebbles and slag heaps at mines, as well as within the bark of pine trees and the dry, dead stems of such plants as elder and in reeds. Females are able to burrow into flat bare soil to form her oval cells which are made mainly of clay, and in these circumstances the openings of the cells are level with the soil surface and may be in a group. The adults have been recorded foraging for nectar at the flowers of sea holly, brambles, hogweed and thistles. The cuckoo wasp Chrysis ignita is known to be a kleptoparasite of A. scoticus and it is probable that Chrysis rutiliventris is also a kleptoparasite of this species. Subspecies There are three recognised subspecies of Ancistrocerus scoticus: *Ancistrocerus scoticus iberogallicus Bl√ºthgen, 1956 *Ancistrocerus scoticus meridianus Gusenleitner, 1977 *Ancistrocerus scoticus scoticus (Curtis, 1826) References Category:Hymenoptera of Europe Category:Potter wasps Category:Insects described in 1826 ","title":"Ancistrocerus scoticus"},{"id":"53929950","text":"Dr. George Richard Potts (6 December 1939 ‚Äì 30 March 2017), known as Dick, was an internationally renowned ecologist and conservationist. He was a specialist in the partridge. He is primarily associated with the Game & Wildlife Conservation Trust (then known as the Game Conservation Trust) for which he started many successful conservation projects. He was director of the Game Conservation Trust from 1993 to 2001. He is the author of many scientific papers and some books. The focus of his research for which his most well-known is on the relationship between modern agriculture and game birds and animals. Potts was awarded the RSPB Medal shortly before his death.  Biography  = Early Years = Dick Potts was raised in North Yorkshire on a farm where he learned first hand about the interaction between wildlife and farming. He was particularly affected by the Winter of 1946‚Äì47 in the United Kingdom as it killed many birds and other wild animals on his family's farm. = Education = Potts studied zoology at Durham University. He earned his PhD by studying the European shag on England's Farne Islands. = Career: Game Conservation Trust = In 1968, Potts joined the Game & Wildlife Conservation Trust (then known as the Game Conservation Trust) as a scientist and began both the Partridge Survival Project and the Sussex Study. Potts and colleague Paul Vickerman, based on work done in the Sussex Study, published the paper ‚ÄúStudies on the Cereal Ecosystem\\" in 1974 suggesting that agriculture and wildlife could coexist and should be studied along with pristine wild land. In 1976, Potts moved to Fordingbridge, taking on the role of Directory of Research for the Game Conservation Trust in 1977. In this role, he extended the research of the Sussex Project to a series of experiments - the first was the Cereal and Gamebirds Project, the second was the Salisbury Plain Experiment. In 1993, Potts became the director of the Game Conservation Trust. As director, he helped turn Loddington Farm into a demonstration farm. He also championed the Joint Raptor Project. Potts retired from the Trust in 2001. = Retirement = In retirement Potts continued to work on Partridge habitat.  Conservation Projects  = Partridge Survival Project = The Partridge Survival Project began in April 1968 when Chris Hunt, the founding chairman of the Game & Wildlife Conservation Trust, assigned Dick Potts to explore the effects of pesticides on the grey partridge. Initially, 62 square kilometers of farmland in Sussex, England was used for the project. The project focused on mortality among grey partridge chicks and tracked among other things the populations of various invertebrates that make up the diet of these young birds.

It contains what may be the oldest wine cellar in London. Numbers 16-18 St James's Place were built as private residences in the 17th Century. With the addition of number 18 in 1912, the block of houses was converted into the Stafford Hotel. Since its founding, the hotel has passed through several ownership groups and undergone a major renovation. Private homes  Numbers 16, 17, and 18 were all constructed as homes in the 17th century. During this period, Lord Francis Godolphin built an extensive wine cellar under the houses. Reportedly, the wine cellar had doorways that led to St James‚Äôs Palace. During the 19th century, number 17 St. James Place was owned by Lord Lyttenton and his wife. In 1849, the family left the house when Lady Lyttelton became a nanny to Queen Victoria‚Äôs children. In the succeeding years, number 17 became the Richmond Club Chambers, Green's Private Hotel and St James's Palace Hotel. In 1886, the Stafford Club moved into number 18.  Stafford Hotel  In 1912, number 16 was added to 17 and 18 to become the Stafford Hotel. At some point, the Madame Prunier wine shipping company moved into the wine cellars During the Second World War, the Stafford served as a club for American and Canadian officers stationed in London. This led to the formation of the Better 'Ole Club whose membership includes the Prince of Wales. During the war, Simone Prunier, a restaurateur in Paris and London, housed her collection of wine in the cellars for safekeeping. The cellars also served as public bomb shelters. In 1947 the Costain Company, headed by Sir Richard Costain, purchased the Stafford. In 1985 it was sold to Trafalgar House, to complement their ownership of the Ritz and Cunard Line. Cunard oversaw the development of the Carriage House rooms in the late 1980s and established the Stafford as a favourite with North American visitors. In 1995, the Stafford was bought by Daniel Thwaites plc, a family- controlled Lancashire based brewery. The hotel underwent a six-month closure for major refurbishment in 1996 and an annual spend of over ¬£1 million on redecorating and replacing fabrics and furniture. In 2007 the ‚Äòall suite‚Äô Stafford Mews building was opened. In 2009, The Stafford was purchased by Britannia Hospitality Limited and in 2010 it became part of their Kempinski Hotels collection. In 2014 The Stafford redirected its focus, moved away from Kempinski and was accepted into membership of The Preferred Hotel Group. In 2017 the Carriage House suites were redesigned in collaboration with designer Alexandra Champalimaud. In March 2017 The Stafford launched its new restaurant The Game Bird, overseen by Executive Chef, James Durrant. Nancy Wake, an intelligence agent for the British during World War II, became a Stafford resident in 2001, and celebrated her 90th birthday at the hotel. In 2003, when she entered a nursing home, the Stafford owners absorbed most of the costs of her hotel stay. Wine cellars Cellars at the Stafford Hotel The Stafford wine cellars are considered the oldest in London. They house over 8000 bottles of wines and Champagnes, including many rare and precious vintages and a selection of Armagnacport and single malt whiskies, some dating back to the 1920s. The cellars host an informal museum, with artefacts left by Canadian and American servicemen and women in World War II. The last remaining casket and wine corking machinery are also on show in the main chamber of the cellars.

It helps learners understand the causes and consequences of climate change, prepares them to live with the impacts of climate change and empowers learners to take appropriate actions to adopt more sustainable lifestyles. CCE helps policymakers understand the urgency and importance of putting mechanisms into place to combat climate change on a national and global scale. Communities learn about how climate change will affect them, what they can do to protect themselves from negative consequences, and how they can reduce their own climate footprint. In particular, CCE helps increase the resilience of already vulnerable communities who are the most likely to be adversely affected by climate change. CCE is rooted in Education for sustainable development (ESD).  UNESCO Climate Change Education for Sustainable Development programme  Established in 2010, the UNESCO Climate Change Education for Sustainable Development programme (CCESD) aims to help people understand climate change by expanding CCE activities in nonformal education through the media, networking and partnerships. It is grounded in the holistic approach of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) which incorporates key sustainable development issues such as climate change, disaster risk reduction and others into education, in a way that addresses the interdependence of environmental sustainability, economic viability and social justice. It promotes participatory teaching and learning methods that motivate and empower learners to change their behaviour and take action for sustainable development. The programme seeks to help people understand the impact of global warming today and increase ‚Äòclimate literacy‚Äô, especially among young people, and aims to make education a more central part of the international response to climate change. UNESCO works with national governments to integrate CCE into national curricula and to develop innovative teaching and learning approaches for doing so.  Selected country profiles regarding CCE and ESD  = Australia = Australia has been at the forefront of education for sustainability, adopting in 2000 a national plan entitled Environmental Education for a Sustainable Future. A number of initiatives and bodies were created to implement the national plan, including the Australian Sustainable Schools Initiative and Australian Research Institute for Environment and Sustainability. These provided a strong foundation for Australia‚Äôs strategy, launched in 2006, to respond to the UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development. The strategy set out the goal to mainstream sustainability through a holistic approach that engages the community through education and lifelong learning. Whereas climate change was referred to as one of a number of environmental concerns in the first national plan, a new plan launched in 2009, entitled Living Sustainably: the Australian Government‚Äôs National Action Plan for Education for Sustainability, had a greater focus on climate change and its impacts on other natural resources within a wider global context. The new plan incorporated climate change within education for sustainability, rather than establishing a new and potentially competing field of Climate Change Education. Australia introduced its first-ever national curriculum in 2014, including sustainability as one of three cross-curriculum subjects. Since 2009, Climate Change Education has been most evident in the VET sector. COAG endorsed the Green Skills Agreement in 2009, and the Ministerial Council for Vocational and Technical Education published the National VET Sector Sustainability Policy and Action Plan (2009-2012). These initiatives aimed to provide workers with the skills needed to transition to a low-carbon economy and VET teachers with suitable training packages to promote education for sustainability. = China = China introduced environmental education in the late 1970s as a result of increased attention to sustainable development and the need to protect the environment. Following the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (Rio de Janeiro, 1992), environmental education moved towards environment, population and development, and finally education for sustainable development. The Chinese government has produced a number of policy documents identifying environmental education and ESD as key to quality education. In 2003, the Ministry of Education issued the first guiding policy - the Guidelines for Implementing Environmental Education in Elementary and Secondary School - on environmental education in China. ESD was formally incorporated into the national education policy in 2010 in The National Education Outline 2010-2020, and further integrated in some local education policies. National climate change policies and plans in China refer to education but do not specifically address CCE. This has resulted in limited institutional support to date. There is no national ESD or CCE action plan or official policy to inform its implementation. In China, ESD mainly refers to providing individuals with the scientific knowledge, learning capacity, values and lifestyle choices to meet the country‚Äôs sustainable development objectives. CCE is most commonly implemented as a component of ESD. A number of educational approaches have been adopted to facilitate the implementation of ESD. These include integrating ESD values into school philosophy, curriculum development, capacity-building of teachers and educators, ESD pedagogical approaches and ESD and CCE thematic activities. ESD is a component of compulsory education, but is limited in higher education, VET and adult education. The Ministry of Education has recently issued a guidance document that identified the VET sector in particular as needing to be reformed to meet the sustainable development objectives of the Chinese economy. = Denmark = Denmark and its neighbouring countries began working together in the 1990s to formulate a policy for ESD. While Denmark signed the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) declaration on ESD in 2005, it did not adopt a strategy until 2009, just before the half-way point of the DESD. The Ministry of Education, which was made responsible for the DESD, organised a consultation process on how to promote ESD before adopting its strategy in 2009. The UN Climate Summit (COP15) held in Denmark in December 2009 provided the impetus to develop of a number of national ESD policy initiatives. A national strategy on ESD was developed with a substantial climate change component. The aim of the strategy is to make citizens more responsible for their actions by improving their scientific knowledge. The ESD strategy notes that climate change should not be the sole focus of ESD, though the concrete initiatives that are part of the strategy mostly support the CCE projects and activities that were part of COP15 preparations. A new national school curriculum adopted in 2009 included elements of ESD and CCE. The concept of sustainability was embedded in the goals describing the interrelationships between nature and society. CCE is mostly approached as teaching climate science, but it was also included in subjects such as geography and social studies, where the interrelationships between human behaviour, consumption and climate are examined. There has been no explicit policy change in the TVET sector to upgrade skills to respond to climate change and environmental issues. However, it is important to note that the Danish TVET sector had previously reflected skills related to ecological modernisation in areas such as energy generation, waste management and agriculture. While the new government identified the economic and environmental climate change crises as important, education is only referred to in relation to the economic crisis. There is no mention of climate change or sustainability with regard to education, and the platform documentation on ‚Äògreen transition‚Äô does not mention education. Overall, no policy strategy has been set to promote ESD, CCE, or the ‚Äògreening‚Äô of TVET as part of the government‚Äôs sustainable development and climate change policies. Government initiatives support NGO- led projects to raise community awareness of climate change. A national network on ESD was established with funding through to 2013. = Dominican Republic = The Dominican Republic has taken a lead role in promoting ESD. Environmental education was made mandatory for all schools in 1998 and this has since evolved into ESD. In 2000, the General Law of Environment and Natural Resources changed the way environmental education was taught, moving from a subject matter to a cross-cutting and interdisciplinary theme. Risk management is also an important aspect of MINERD‚Äôs strategic plan, and has been integrated into the school curriculum as a cross-cutting subject. In 2004, the Environmental Education Strategy for Sustainable Development was adopted, which fosters formal and non-formal ESD. It is based on constructivism and uses a variety of pedagogical techniques that promote participatory learning. The Ten-year 2008-2018 Education Plan (PDE) addresses the issue of quality education, including sustainable development and a culture of peace. It also established a process for periodic review of the curriculum. Climate change is also being introduced into the curriculum. The National Teacher Training Institute (INAFOCAM) and the Salom√© Ure√±a Higher Institute for Teacher Training (ISFODOSU) provide support for environmental education through teacher training and curriculum support. The Ten-year 2008-2018 Higher Education Plan (PDES) includes environmental issues in the curricula and establishes a research programme to promote sustainable development. The Dominican Republic has been involved in a number of ESD and CCE initiatives that have helped build local capacity, including: * formal, non-formal and informal projects on ESD led by governmental agencies, civil society organizations, young leaders and local communities; * UN: CC Learn Project, which supports the design and implementation of results-oriented and sustainable learning to address climate change (see the detailed case study in this Report); * National Strategy to Strengthen Human Resource Capacities to Advance Green, Low Emission and Climate Resilient Development (ENDVBERC); * teacher training supported by the UN: CC Learn-UNITAR, and the UNESCO-CCESD pilot programme. =UK= In the United Kingdom, the Teach the Future campaign aims to rapidly repurpose the education system around the climate emergency and ecological crisis; they are cohosted by the UK Student Climate Network and SOS-UK and are in the process of devolving their campaign to Scotland and Northern Ireland from England. They have 3 asks of the Government * A government commissioned review into how the English formal education system is preparing students for the climate emergency and ecological crisis * The inclusion of the climate emergency and ecological crisis in English teaching standards and training * The enactment of an English Climate Emergency Education Act - the first student written bill in history England Environmental and development education have been present in England since the 1970s, when civil society organizations took the lead. From the late 1990s, the UK government promoted sustainable development and ESD at the local, regional and national levels. However, while a number of strategic government reports addressed CCE, government policy has focused less on ESD since 2010. The 2008 report Brighter Futures ‚Äì Greener Lives: Sustainable Development Action Plan 2008-2010 outlined a number of specific initiatives related to Climate Change Education using an ESD approach. This included empowering youth with the skills, knowledge and freedom to voice their opinions and make a difference. The same year, CCE was introduced into the Key Stage 3 (11 to 14 year-olds) geography curriculum. The report Education for Sustainable Development in the UK 2010 noted that there were signs of substantial progress in embedding ESD-related policies and developing practices in the UK across a wide range of sectors in 2008 and 2009. For example, documents in 2009 highlighted the ‚ÄòSustainable Schools‚Äô project that aims to empower youth to cope with the future challenges facing the planet. The aim is for all schools to be ‚ÄòSustainable Schools‚Äô by 2020. Scotland The Scottish Government commissioned a climate change TV advert, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Smb3jZUPHA possibly as part of public awareness program. = Republic of Korea = The Republic of Korea has a number of policies and initiatives supporting environmental education. In 2008, the Environmental Education Promotion Act encouraged the development of environmental education. It aimed to raise national environmental awareness, to encourage people to develop research and inquiry skills, and to put what they learn into action. The Ministry of Environment, in its 2011-2015 Environmental Education Master Plan, proposed a policy agenda for environmental education to be implemented through formal education, social environmental education and educational infrastructure approaches. The various approaches in the formal education area include: * ‚ÄòEnvironment and Green Growth‚Äô as an elective subject in middle and high school curricula, and classes in elementary school designed to integrate environmental education; * the establishment of the Natural Environmental Studies Institute that o ers interactive youth programmes for environmental studies; * Environment Model Schools, designed to demonstrate best-practice; * ‚ÄòLow Carbon Challenge‚Äô involving ten universities; * in-service training for teachers to upskill, specializing in environmental education. = Vietnam = The development of ESD in Vietnam took place in the most recent decades. The National Council of Sustainable Development was formed in 2006 to acknowledge the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (DESD) (). A committee consisting of high-ranking leaders such as government leaders and ministers were appointed to develop an education for sustainability guideline. The Ministry for Education and Training (MOET) played an important role to push forward establishment goals for ESD and CCE. Furthermore, they were also able to recognize the climate change impacts overall in Vietnam such as increase in average temperature and sea rise level. From 1951-2000, Vietnam‚Äôs global average temperature increased about 0.5-0.7 Celsius, and sea level had risen about 20 cm (). These two factors had put a hold on the growing socioeconomic achievements; therefore, MOET acted on the development education aspects to mitigate climate change in the future (). The first key steps MOET promoted toward ESD and CCE were the National Action Plan of Education for Sustainable Development of Viet Nam in 2010 and the Action Plan for Response to Climate Change of the Education Sector for the period of 2011-2015 (). Action Plan of Education for Sustainable Development In 2016, Vietnam, Costa Rica, and Kenya started their partnership with UNESCO to establish high standard ESD policies at a regional and global level (). Through UNESCO, there were four main projects that the countries can get involved in different socioeconomic levels such as Advancing ESD policy development, A whole-institution approach to climate change through the UNESCO Associated Schools Network (ASPnet), Sustainability starts with teachers, Empower youth ESD leaders as change agents, and Community for ESD. Climate Change Education In 2009, MOET was able to develop and implement environmental education (EE) and CCE education into formal education curriculum. This gained approval from ESD standpoints (,), however it was still not considered to count towards all ESD approaches (,). Furthermore, one of the main challenges MOET was facing during this time was an increase of materials on top the regular curriculum, resulted in overloading students with knowledge.

With an organizational history dating to the early 19th century, it is one of the oldest such institutions in the state. Its architecturally distinguished campus, located 1680 Albany Avenue, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Services The Village provides a broad array of services intended to support the needs of children and families. Services offered include financial and social services for at-risk families, more intensive services including outpatient and inpatient residential treatments for children with emotional and mental health issues, and adoption placement services. Campus The Village's primary facilities are located in northwestern Hartford, at the junction of Albany Avenue (United States Route 44) and Bloomfield Avenue (Connecticut Route 189). Resembling an English country village, it was designed by New York architect Grosvenor Atterbury and built in the 1920s. The \\"cottage plan\\" of its layout, with multiple smaller buildings, was then a popular form for the institutional treatment of needy individuals. Although there is a similarity of design to the buildings in the complex, each one has unique and distinguishing characteristics, in a bid to give each one a more homelike feeling for its residents. History The Village's origins are in a number of early social services organizations whose foundings were in the early 19th century. The Female Beneficent Society was founded in 1809 for the benefit of indigent girls, and the Hartford Orphan Asylum was established in 1833. These organizations merged in 1865, retaining the name \\"Hartford Orphan Asylum\\". It built a dormitory-style facility on Putnam Avenue in 1879. With the rise in popularity of the \\"cottage plan\\" for institutional housing, the organization had its current campus built in the 1920s on land donated by Reverend Francis Goodwin. Through the 20th century, the organization's mission broadened beyond the care of orphaned children to include family services, seeking to address issues caused by poverty and family breakdown.

Bryan's platform advocated for the reinstatement of silver currency in the United States economy as part of the short-lived Silver Republican Party. In the wake of the panic of 1893 came the dawn of the upcoming presidential campaign. Farm prices collapsed, banks failed, unemployment was at 20%, and the economy was stalled. The money supply was backed by gold. The government could not print more greenbacks without gold backing. The protectionists wanted high tariffs to keep out foreign goods and create jobs in the United States. The Populist Party's remedy was to substantially increase the money supply by adopting a dual monetary standard. With the acceptance of silver as an additional backer, more money could be printed. The United States had vast silver deposits in reserve as well as in the ground, waiting to be mined. The working man supported this addition of silver. These issues polarized the people of the west and south on one side and the northeast on the other, farmer against the industrialist, the well-to- do against the lower economic classes. Candidates need an issue or platform upon which to sell themselves. For the elections of 1896 and 1900, Bryan chose the issue of the standard by which the government backed its currency - either with just gold or his choice of both silver and gold. Supported by both the National Silver Party and the Populist Party, Bryan, a Democrat from Nebraska, ran unsuccessfully against William McKinley of Ohio in both those races. The Silverites referred to the inscription used on the edge of the first silver dollars, 1794-1804, \\"HUNDRED CENTS ONE DOLLAR OR UNIT\\" as evidence that the intentions were to have the silver dollar a unit of measure. Bryan expounded the free coinage of silver using the ratio, 16 oz. of silver = 1 oz. of gold. Free coinage of silver means a person could bring silver ingots to the United States Mint and have them coined. For example, $0.53 of silver would produce a silver dollar, which is what the Morgan dollar (1878-1921) contained. If the government issued dollars containing 100 cents worth of silver, they would have been very large and cumbersome. Bryan's opponents quickly exaggerated the size of this coin and made base metal caricature or satirical pieces produced in lead type metal, zinc, Babbitt metal, tin, bronze, aluminum, iron and other combinations. Some were as large as approximately 8 inches. The level of quality of the Bryan Money was controlled by the individual ability of each craftsman (see example). Tradesmen groomed in the nineteenth century had various talents. The makers of Bryan Money were printers, blacksmiths, tool and die makers, hardware people, foundry workers, dentists and any handy person bursting with political opinion. There also were thousands produced and sold for profit by the manufacturers of novelties. Affluent jewelers in the east, such as Tiffany & Co., made several different coin silver comparative pieces (see example). They showed the outline of the Morgan dollar in comparison to the larger full content dollar. Also shown were the date, fineness of silver, and the rate of exchange of 16 to 1. Satirical dollar obverse mocking Bryan's proposed 16:1 Ratio SCH-739 Obverse Satirical dollar reverse mocking Bryan's proposed 16:1 Ratio SCH-739 Reverse Comparative Dollar produced by Tiffany & Co. SCH-3 Obverse  Political context  Following the demonetization of silver, dubbed the \\"Crime of ‚Äò73\\", tensions arose between factions of both the Democratic and Republican political parties. Some wished to maintain a single gold standard, while others advocated for a bi-metal standard in which silver would be valued at a rate of 16 ounces for every ounce of gold. During the 1896 and 1900 elections, Bryan, along with several lesser parties, argued for a dual standard because it would enable the government to put more paper money into circulation, as it could be backed by both gold and silver. His opponent William McKinley's platform preserved the gold standard. McKinley's supporters issued Bryan Money as a political statement about these dueling standards.  Types of Bryan Money  Bryan Money falls into two categories: comparative and satirical. Comparative tokens were made of coin silver by true silversmiths. Their main purpose was to compare the size and ratio of silver needed for dual standard currency to silver's market price. These pieces were modeled after the silver dollar format and were later banned due to counterfeiting concerns. Satirical tokens bore \\"derisive or humorous inscriptions\\" that mocked the proposed dual standard. Many pieces had similar slogans such as \\"In God We Trust for the Other 47 Cents\\" and \\"16 to 1 NIT\\" (Not In Trust), referring to the proposed value ratio of silver to gold. These pieces were more often cast or struck and made of type metal or alloys of lead and aluminum. Other designs were made of less typical materials such as iron, copper, tin or cardboard. After the design's initial production, individual craftsmen would often copy them in a crude fashion and distribute them to fellow supporters, contributing to the variety of quality of Bryan Monies. Comparative Dollar produced by Tiffany and Co. SCH-3 Reverse  Collecting Bryan Money  Bryan Money was never intended for circulation and was rarely carried so it was spared the normal wear of other collectible currency. Most imperfections consist of rim bumps and scratches from accidental damage or graffiti. Grading by third parties and an interest in so-called dollars increased the value of many Bryan pieces. Bryan Money designs were also used in other collectibles. These included \\"Campaign Bills\\" in which the designs were printed on material similar to paper money, and silk fabrics with embroidered designs that were used for neckties and other purposes. Coin collectors had little interest in Bryan Money in the late 1800s because it was not a true currency, but rather political commentary. Farran Zerbe raised awareness of the tokens' collectible nature when he published his definitive catalog, Bryan Money: Tokens of the Presidential Campaigns of 1896 and 1900 - Comparative and Satirical, in the July 1926 volume of The Numismatist. Now, due to its political relevance, both numismatists and collectors of political memorabilia take interest in Bryan Money. Zerbe's article captured what makes Bryan Money distinctive from other collectible currency: :\\"Bryan Money is unique as a series. The monetary- political issue, conditions and temperament of the time, and the tolerance of disregard for the letter of the law, all being in favorable conjunction, made possible what never before or may never again occur - such a large and interesting variety of grotesque political satires in metal.\\" Today, Bryan Money is cataloged by Schornstein Number (SCH) in accordance with the Token and Medal Society (TAMS) 2001 publication Bryan Money and the 2012 Bryan Money Supplement and Price Guide, both by Fred Schornstein.

History The site of Freiria and its surrounding areas had always been sites of human settlement, given the access of water. A Palaeolithic site was identified 300 metres to the north of the villa and evidence of a Chalcolithic settlement was found 200 metres to the northeast. At Cabe√ßo do Mouro, four hundred meters to the west, two late Bronze Age settlements have been identified. Evidence suggests that the Freiria area was occupied at the end of the 1st Iron Age and continued to be occupied when the end of the 2nd Iron Age briefly co-existed with Roman occupation. Radiocarbon dating has identified items dating back to the second half of the 10th century BCE. While many of the items found on the site from the Iron Age were clearly imported into the area, towards the end of the period there was a gradual increase in the presence of locally made ceramics. The Roman occupation of Freiria occurred after its occupation during the Iron Age. Many of the most recent objects found at the site that are attributable to the Iron Age were found together with the oldest Roman items. Freiria gained importance in the first century CE, with an increase in new construction and renovation. This lasted until the fifth century when the area began to decline. The villa was constructed in the 2nd century. Verg√≠lio Correia was the first to identify Roman vestiges in the area, when he discovered a Roman tombstone near the local quarries in 1912. First archaeological excavations occurred on site in 1973, by Guilherme Cardoso and Jos√© d'Encarna√ß√£o. Further work was carried out between 1985 and 2002 by the same archaeologists, with the site having been identified as a Roman villa in 1985. The 1985, excavations unearthed a domus, granary and thermae. Further excavations starting on 13 July 1987, financed by the Portuguese Institute for Architectural Heritage (Instituto Portugu√™s do Patrim√≥nio Arquitet√≥nico), with logistical support from the municipal council and tourism bureau, resulting in the definition of a special zone of the villa fructu√°ria. The discovery of numerous bell-shaped ceramic fragments document the occupation of this area to a proto-historic phase of settlement. Among these were: the inferior section a windmill, a dog-like gargoyle with barred teeth, needles and bone pins; iron alloys; bronze needle and a ceramic mold with the decoration of a lion. There are also in southern area of the villa with further stratigraphic layers of further potential archaeological interest. Architecture The site is situated in a rural area surrounded by agricultural lands. It is constituted by a \\"villa\\", with the \\"domus\\", of which a few floors have been found in the northeast corner of the peristyle (with a covered patio set on columns, around a garden) with a marble column base and fallen capital, and an \\"impluvium\\" (square opening in the middle of the atrium that collected rainwater. In the thermae is a water tank, with stones detected suggesting a possible buttress supporting the wall of the tank, possibly being a \\"natatio\\" that would simultaneously serve the northern thermal complex and the needs of the villa fructu√°ria. The surrounding agricultural area includes rural structures such as a barn and winery.

Seed bugs are a very diverse family of seed feeders found on various types of vegetation.There are four Nearctic species in this genus. O. bimaculate and O. cubana are neotropical species that barely make it into the United States. Diet, ecology, and distribution Oedancala dorsalis, can be found living on the seed heads of Carex and Cyperus both as nymphs (resemble adults except they usually have reduced wings and are incapable of flight) and adults. The seed heads allow easy camouflage. The life cycle of this species has not been studied in detail, but it is known to be a gradual, incomplete, metamorphosis (no pupa stage). It is a wide range, from Quebec and New England, west to the Dakotas and Colorado and south to Florida and Texas. Rare in Florida. Description They are moderately sized (6-6.5mm) with bright yellowish tinged with brown. Median and lateral pronotal lines, elongate raised calloused spot on either side of midline of scutellum, pale yellowish to almost white. Scutellar surface and claval commissure black. Apical corial margin sometimes infuscated near apex, lacking a dark spot midway along margun. First label segment extending posteriorly at least to anterior margin of eye. O. crassiman looks similar, but its first segment on its antenna is longer, and is found from Maryland to South America.

Prior to this, he was president and chief operating officer from January 2017 to September 2018, and joint head of the investment banking division from July 2006 to December 2016. In July 2018, Solomon was named CEO, succeeding Lloyd Blankfein as of October 1, 2018, and was named chairman after Blankfein's retirement. Solomon recreationally produces electronic dance music (EDM) records under the stage name DJ D-Sol (). He has performed at nightclubs and music festivals around New York, Miami, and The Bahamas. He released his debut single, \\"Don't Stop\\" with an extended version on Spotify in June 2018. Early life David Michael Solomon was born circa 1962 in Hartsdale, New York, to Jewish parents. His father, Alan Solomon, was an executive vice president of a small publishing company, and his mother, Sandra, worked as an audiology supervisor. He grew up in Scarsdale, New York where he attended Edgemont Junior-Senior High School and worked at a local Baskin Robbins before working as a camp counselor in New Hampshire. He graduated from Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and government. In college he played on the rugby team and chaired his social fraternity, Alpha Delta Phi. After graduating, he applied to Goldman Sachs for a two-year analyst position but was rejected, leading him to apply to Irving Trust, a \\"graduate school at [a] bank\\".  Career  After Irving Trust, he went to work for Drexel Burnham in 1986. At Drexel Burnham he first worked as a commercial paper salesman, but later transitioned to junk bonds. His exposure to high-yield debt prompted him to join Bear Stearns. At Bear Stearns he was charged with leading the junk bonds division and selling higher-risk bonds. On one occasion, he assisted a struggling movie theater company in Dallas, Texas, to raise money through a \\"complicated bond transaction\\". = Goldman Sachs = He worked with a variety of Goldman Sachs managers during the late 1990s which inspired his move to the firm in 1999 to work with their leveraged finance team as a partner, aged 37. His move from Bear Stearns was \\"shocking\\" to contemporaries who believed him to be on the \\"leadership track at Bear\\". Starting in 2006, he was promoted to and spent the next ten years leading Goldman's investment banking division. In July 2007, he secured the initial public offering (IPO) of LuLulemon Athletica wearing a maroon blazer and sweatpants, a sampling of the company's clothing to \\"throw everyone off\\" in a suit-required meeting. During his time as head, he implemented \\"year-end compensation roundtables\\" where he would pepper the executives with questions about their business practices in order to \\"weed out under-performers\\". Upon his departure, he was credited with professionalizing the investment banking division and doubling profit margins from 11% to 22% with sales rising by 70%. In April 2014, Sheldon Adelson, a client of his from Drexel Burnham, offered Solomon operational control over the Las Vegas Sands casinos. Solomon declined the offer because Adelson \\"wasn‚Äôt willing to give up day-to-day control, and [he] didn‚Äôt want to be an understudy.\\" Despite Goldman Sachs not disclosing his total compensation packages, SEC and IRS filings indicate that Solomon was paid a base salary of US$1.85 million with an award of restricted stock worth about $10 million in January 2015. After Gary Cohn resigned from Goldman to become the Chief Economic Advisor to Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States, Solomon was elevated to president and co-chief operating officer along with Harvey Schwartz in December 2016. In a series of interviews in October 2017, Solomon detailed his advice for students and future employees at Goldman: know how to write and speak publicly, know accounting, and never lose sight of what you are passionate about. Under Solomon's leadership, the bank has increased pay for programmers, loosened dress codes, modernized computer systems, instituted video interviews, and created a \\"real-time performance review\\" system for new employees. Solomon received $11.85 million compensation package in January 2017 and January 2018. It was estimated that Solomon holds 224,030 (0.059%) shares of Goldman Sachs Group (GS) which was valued at $58 million in January 2018. In March 2020, Solomon was granted some US$27.5 million in compensation. This was made up of his base pay which was a $2 million salary as well as a $7.65 million cash bonus. On top of that he also was granted $17.85 million in long-term incentive. On March 12, 2018 Goldman announced that Schwartz, the company's co-chief operating officer and president would be resigning, leaving Solomon as the second-in-command. Hours after the announcement, media outlets‚Äìboth domestic and international‚Äìinformally designated Solomon as Lloyd Blankfein's sole heir apparent. At a board meeting on February 21, 2018 Blankfein expressed an interest and preference for Solomon to succeed him. During March 2018, Solomon has repeatedly advocated for a reformation of Goldman's company culture. He expressed an interest in lowering the maximum hours worked during normal business days from somewhere near 90 hours a week, to somewhere near 70 to 75 hours a week, when not actively engaged in closing a deal. Prior to assuming the company's presidency, he tracked the hours worked by his subordinates and frequently stepped in to send employees home. Solomon took office as the chief executive officer (CEO) of the firm on October 1, 2018.  Music  He recreationally performs monthly gigs as a disc jockey under the stage name \\"DJ D-Sol\\" () producing a variety of electronic dance music (EDM). He has performed at nightclubs and music festivals around New York, Miami, and the Bahamas. Solomon maintains the Instagram account \\"@djdsolmusic\\" to catalogue his exploits as a music producer. On January 9, 2018, he released a cover of Fleetwood Mac's song, \\"Don't Stop\\". Hours after its release, the song was played on Sirius XM's BPM: Electronic Dance Music Hits at 9:14 pm EST. Solomon performed a remix of The Pink Panther Theme at a charity event for the opioid epidemic hosted by Hamilton College on April 8, 2018. Under Crowd Records Solomon released his debut single \\"Don't Stop\\" with an extended version on Spotify in June 2018. The song debuted at No. 39 on Billboard's electronic dance music charts. \\"Don't Stop\\" was listed in Spotify's 263,361-follower playlist \\"Happy Summer Beats\\". His Spotify profile has 550,000 monthly listeners with his debut single garnering 1.2 million listens. Shortly after his debut release Solomon opened a Soundcloud account where he posts extended musical sets and concert performances. = Safe & Sound charity concert = On July 25, 2020, Solomon was the opening act for The Chainsmokers at a charity concert, called \\"Safe & Sound\\" that was meant to be a future example of COVID-19 pandemic audience safety. The event was investigated by the state of New York health authorities for \\"rampant\\" violations of social distancing guidelines. A Goldman Sachs spokesperson said Solomon left before the show ended. Personal life Solomon married Mary Elizabeth Solomon (n√©e Coffey) in 1989 when they were both 27 years old in Bernardsville, New Jersey. They divorced in early 2018. He has resided in The San Remo on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City from 2002 onward. He listed the apartment for $24 million in May 2016. He purchased a 13,000-square-foot estate in Aspen, Colorado in 2004 for $4 million and listed it for $36 million in July 2016. In January 2018, Solomon discovered that a personal assistant had stolen around 500 bottles from his rare wine collection, among them, seven from the French estate Domaine de la Romanee-Conti. The personal assistant, Nicolas DeMeyer, was arrested in late January and indicted for the theft of $1.2 million worth of wine. On October 9, 2018 Nicolas DeMeyer committed suicide by leaping to his death from the 33rd floor window of the Carlyle Hotel, minutes after he was scheduled to appear before a Manhattan judge in relation to the alleged wine theft. Solomon has served on Hamilton College's board of trustees since 2005. He is on the board of directors of the Robin Hood Foundation, a charitable organization which attempts to alleviate problems caused by poverty in New York City.

She studied calligraphy in childhood and majored in ceramics at Hongik University, graduating with a Bachelor‚Äôs of Fine Art in 1984. After graduating Lee worked as a photo journalist and later as a freelance photographer. In 1987, she immersed herself for one year in a project focused on documenting the life of an old man who made his living hunting for wild ginseng. This experience motivated Lee to become a photographer and expand her technical knowledge of photography by traveling to New York City and enrolling in New York University to pursue an MA in photography. While in New York City, Lee worked for the photographer Robert Frank whose travels across the United States may have influenced Lee‚Äôs own decision to take a road trip across the United States. In her travels she encountered the American Desert, a landscape that she is deeply moved by and which becomes the subject of several of her photographic series, including Desert (1990‚Äì94), American Desert I‚ÄìIV (1990-1996), On Road (2000‚Äì01), Wind (2004-07) and Remains (2012-). Lee photographs these barren landscapes when they are transformed by the tumultuous weather, discarded refuse, decaying structures and by her own photographic process. Lee's Unnamed Road (2010-12) was part of This Place. Photographic process Lee uses a unique photographic process: > For my work, the darkroom process is just as important as the digital > process. Throughout the process, I focus on transmitting on my prints the > feelings that I felt as the time of taking the photograph. I try to deliver > the essence of what I truly want to express. She begins by photographing the subject with a medium-format panoramic camera. She prints on a traditional mulberry paper which she hand sensitizes with a brush using Liquid Light. This print is then scanned and Lee further manipulates the image in Photoshop. The resulting image is a high contrast black and white print, in which the indexical brush marks are still visible. Lee effaces the technological capability of her digital camera to communicate her emotional state of mind at the time she takes the photograph to the viewer. This process also results in an image that recalls traditional Asian ink painting. Recognition Lee's photographic practice is important within the context of contemporary Korean photography, but also more broadly she is part of a contemporary photographic movement of photographers pushing the physical boundaries of photography as a medium to expose and communicate the essence of a subject. For Lee, effacing the technological capabilities of her camera allows her to explore the symbolic boundaries of landscape as a genre. Photo scholar and critic Eugenia Parry explores Lee's series through the lens of Buddhist spirituality in the essay that accompanies Lee's photobook Wind. Parry observes that in Lee's photographs she contrasts discarded props of human life with the land, symbolically acting as her on Buddhist teacher, asking viewers to \\"view ordinary things, love change, tolerate absolute incomprehensibility. Contemplate the temporal, recognize the celestial\\". Photo critic and historian Vicki Goldberg observes that Lee's landscapes represent her own, \\"introspective states and thoughts.\\" While the majority of Lee's work focuses on the land; in several series she explores other subjects in the series including Pagodas (1998); crumbling Buddhist sculptures, Buddhas (2002); every objects, Thing (2003‚Äì06) and portraits, Breath (2009‚Äì). Lee has received several awards recognizing her work as well as group and solo exhibitions, commissions as well as numerous publications documenting her work.

In 1987, volunteers began to uncover the pit and maintain it. It lies within the mining region of Sexau and Freiamt. The oldest parts of the Caroline Pit date with some certainty to the 11th to 13th centuries, but these are the uppermost levels. There are no definite clues to older operation, for example in Roman times. The majority of the pit's buildings and structures, including the shafts and galleries date to the 16th century. Especially noteworthy is the original forging die on the sixth level of the mine which has survived with its wooden frame and winch supports; it has been dated dendrochronologically to 1528/30.

Djakarta Passenger Transport Public Company, simplified as Perum PPD) is an Indonesian state- owned company that moves in the transportation sector, specifically land transportation in Jakarta and areas around. It is known that Perum PPD operates approximately 494 single buses and 59 articulated buses for TransJakarta. Perum PPD is also known to operate JA Connexion, JR Connexion and Transjabodetabek routes.  History  Founded back at 1920, Perum PPD is a state owned company that is under control of the Ministry of Transportation that went along with the country's history. What would be Perum PPD, which have been commissioned as a public company in 1981 based on Government Regulation No. 24 of 1981 which is enhanced into Government Regulation No. 32 of 1984, is the result of merging the Nederlandsch Indische Tram Maatschappij with the Bataviasch Elektrische Tram Maatschappij approaching in 1925 corresponding with the advice from the Burgemeester of Batavia City which was under Ir. Voorneman and became Bataviasche Verkeers Maatchappij (BVM NV). A locally bodied Mercedes Benz OH 408 PPD bus depot at Klender Former Japanese bus operated by Perum PPD However, since the occupation of Japan in Indonesia from 1942 until 1945, BVM NV was changed into Djakarta Shinden () which only operates the city's tram. City buses from the BVM NV was used for other needs. Just a day after The Nation proclaimed independence, a number of workers of Djakarta Shinden sponsored by Menteng 31 youth urged for the Japanese authorities to immediately hand over the tram to the youth. Since 20 August 1945, the tram was handed over to the Indonesian Government and was operated by Djawatan Kereta Api tram section. To prioritize public interest, BVMNV was then nationalized and controlled by the Transport Minister under Emergency Act No.10 of 1954. As a follow-up to the nationalization, with deed from notary Mr. Raden Suwandi No. 76 dated 30 June 1954 and No. 82 dated 21 December 1954, BVMNV has its legal form as a public company and named Perum Pengangkut Penumpang Djakarta (Perum PPD). Based on Government Regulation No. 205 of 1961, the company changes status to state company (PN) under the Department of Land Transportation, Post, Telecommunication and Tourism, became Perusahaan Negara Pengangkutan Penumpang Djakarta (PN PPD). Then based on Government Regulation No. 229 year 1961 dated 20 September 1961, management of PN PPD was handed over from the Department of Land Transportation, Post, Telecommunication and Tourism to the Regional Government of DKI Jakarta. In 1981, management of PN PPD was returned to the national government through the Department of Transportation based on Government Regulation No. 23 of 1981 dated 17 July 1981. The company status became public company or perusahaan umum (perum) based on Government Regulation No. 24 of 1981, thus PN PPD returned into Perum PPD. In 1991, Mercedes Benz OH 408s with completely built- up (CBU) body by Volgren and some completely knocked down (CKD) units with locally made bodies were purchased in preparation of the 1992 Non-Aligned Movement Summit. These buses were then operated by Perum PPD and Perum DAMRI as city buses in various cites throughout the country. The national government also received some to be operated as staff buses. In 2004, Perum PPD added 55 former Japanese buses to the fleet of regular city buses. Previously, Perum PPD received 30 buses donated by the Government of Japan and did not encounter problems. Perum PPD regular city bus services thrive up to 2011. 2011 starts a new era of public transportation in Jakarta. TransJakarta starts to open new routes, often overlapping Perum PPD regular routes. At this point, Perum PPD buses reach an age of 20 to 30 years without replacement, known as reckless buses and encounters many problems. In January 2011, the Jakarta Department of Transportation eradicates 15 bus route permits, including six Perum PPD routes. In 2013, Perum PPD did a transformation from regular city bus to Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). Perum PPD also did a transformation in the management in several aspects, namely financial, manpower and operational. By the end of 2016, all PPD city bus routes are either eradicated or deformed into a TransJakarta route (ex: PPD 213 into Corridor 5A, PPD 43 into Corridor 10, PPD 210 into Corridor 4A, etc). Operation Currently Perum PPD has a number of sub-divisions serving different services. =Strategic Business Unit (SBU) TransBusway= Perum PPD operates 494 of the initial 600 units donated from the Ministry of Transportation for TransJakarta. Initial operation began at 11 April 2016 with a fleet of 10 buses, then gradually increases up to 494 units. These buses are distinguished by having 1 door each side, instead of the 2 doors on a standard single TransJakarta bus. The doors utilize sliding mechanism. The driver's door on the left anterior is also used for feeder operation. Buses are bodied by Restu Ibu (Integra), Rahayu Santosa (Cityliner), and Laksana (Discovery). Unlike most newer TransJakarta buses, these units are not equipped with partitions separating the driver from the passengers. Initially, these buses are not equipped with CCTV and side running text display boards. However, as TransJakarta sets new service standards, CCTV and side running text display boards are mandatory equipment, therefore these facilities were then equipped to the buses. Seats are arranged to face the aisle. New Tap-On-Bus (TOB) equipment are also being added to support cashless feeder operation. Routes that SBU TransBusway buses serve are daily set by TransJakarta.

Approximately 150 units are operated under SBU Transjabodetabek. The fleet consists of former APTB units and canceled SBU TransBusway units, therefore has an identical look to SBU TransBusway units. The main difference is by the service sticker on each side, near the doors. Units are operated for JA Connexion, JR Connexion and Transjabodetabek services, which are not integrated to the TransJakarta BRT service. Services are carried out throughout Jabodetabek. The service entirely utilizes the left anterior driver's door. Front-facing seats are featured and some are equipped with bag racks (mostly for JA Connexion service) to accommodate suitcases. Buses are bodied by Trisakti (Ultima), New Armada (Customed Aristo), and Laksana (Discovery).

Mobilindo Armada Cemerlang. This is the third batch of Zhongtong articulated buses for TransJakarta, after the first batch bought by Perum DAMRI and the second by the Jakarta Department of Transportation. A blue - white livery with blue stripes distinguishes these units from its identical predecessors that were colored with a red - yellow livery. The interior is dominated with yellow railings and features cushioned chairs. The units were imported in 2016, however administration problems led to a delay of operations up to 2019. It is stated that these units are not a part of the 2013 Bus Corruption. =Strategic Business Unit (SBU) Bus Repair and Maintenance= SBU Pemeliharaan dan Perbaikan Bus provides reliable repair and maintenance service. Supported by competent manpower, this SBU ensures buses are always at optimum perfect working condition. Aside from serving SBU TransJabodetabek units, this SBU serves other buses that needs maintenance.

Parts of the building date from the 15th century though the core of the fabric may even be earlier, further parts were built in the 17th and 19th centuries. It was the seat of the historical estate of \\"West Bower\\" (Bower Delamere) once held by Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, the brother of Jane Seymour, Henry the VIII\`s Queen, who is reputed to have been born at West Bower Manor. Seymour had inherited it from his cousin Margaret Coker, the last of the Cokers a local landowning family who had been lord of the manor since the Cokers had been granted the land by King Stephen.A P Baggs and M C Siraut, 'Bridgwater: Manors and other estates', in A History of the County of Somerset: Volume 6, andersfield, Cannington, and North Petherton Hundreds (Bridgwater and Neighbouring Parishes), ed.

Coker had been granted the right to add an oratory in 1339. The estate became part of the estate of Halswell House in the second half of the 16th century and has been used as a farm since then. It stands on the banks of Durleigh reservoir which was built in 1938. Architecture The principal surviving element from the Medieval manor is the gatehouse. It is an example of Decorated-Perpendicular architecture. The stone building has been extensively restored, but is a good example of a former courtyard gatehouse with a pair of faceted turrets on either side of the former entrance passageway. The adjacent farmhouse was built in the 19th century.

The original Prose Brut was written in Anglo-Norman; it was subsequently translated into Latin and English. The chronicle begins England's history with the mythological founding of Britain by Brutus of Troy, named \\"Brut\\" in French and English; Brutus is the legendary great-grandson of Aeneas and his founding of Britain thus links that country to the grand history of Troy. The first Anglo-Norman versions end with the death of King Henry III in 1272; subsequent versions extend the narrative. Fifty versions in Anglo-Norman remain, in forty-nine manuscripts, in a variety of versions and stages.Matheson 1‚Äì5.

Origins and subsequent history  A page from Caxton's printing, describing the Percy-Neville feud of 1454 Originally a legendary chronicle written in Anglo-Norman in the thirteenth century (identified by the fact that some existing copies finish in 1272), the Brut described the settling of England by Brutus of Troy, son of Aeneas, and the reign of the Welsh Cadwalader. In this, it was itself based on Geoffrey of Monmouth's text from the previous century.Ruddick 39. It also covered the reigns of many kings later the subject of legend, including King Cole, King Leir (the subject of Shakespeare's play, King Lear), and King Arthur, and exists in both abridged and long versions.Szarmach, P.E, M T. Tavormina, and J.T. Rosenthal (eds), Medieval England: An Encyclopedia (New York, 1998), 146. Early versions describe the country as being divided, both culturally and politically, by the River Humber, with the southern half described as \\"this side of the Humber\\" and \\"the better part\\".Ruddick 94. Having been written at a time of division between crown and nobility, it was \\"baronial in its sympathies\\".Marvin 2013, 169. It was probably originally composed \\"at least in part\\" by clerks in the Royal chancery, although not as an official history.Taylor 11. It later became a source for monastic chronicles.King and Marvin 135ff. Popular already in its early incarnations, it may even have limited the circulation of rival contemporary histories.Spence 10. The Brut underwent various revisions over the centuries, and from 1333 material inflected from a mid-thirteenth century poem, Des Grantz Geanz, describing the settlement of England (as Albion), had entered the main versions. Eventually, along with the Polychronicon, it was one of the most popular political and secular histories of fourteenth-century England,Gransden 73. with the latest-known version ending with events from 1479.Matheson 3. English editions appeared from the early 1400s, particularly the so-called Long version and its various continuations. This has become known as the \\"Common\\" version, and was probably transcribed in Herefordshire. A later fifteenth-century version consists of the Common versions with \\"a major one\\" concluding in 1419, occasionally with the addition of prologues and epilogues. The 1500s also saw an abridged version, created from the major fifteenth-century copies. =Audience= It was primarily of interest to the upper-gentry and the English nobility, but, the more it got added to and altered, so it became noticed by other sectors of society. Firstly the clergy, for whom it was translated into Latin,Myers 38. and then into the more accessible French and then English for the lower gentry and mercantile classes. It was thus available to much of English society; certainly, as Andrea Ruddock has said, to the entire political class. And, since it only took \\"one literate person to make a text available to an entire household\\", its circulation could have been even broader.Ruddick 177. Similarly, there are vast differences in the quality of the surviving manuscripts, and Julia Marvin has suggested that this reflects their \\"diverse ownership and readership\\".Marvin 2013, 170. It has been described as \\"a tremendous success\\",Marvin 2005, 85. and one of the most-copied chronicles of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.Marvin 2013, 170. A version produced in York in the later fourteenth century was based on official contemporary records, and contains, for example, an eye-witness account of the Good Parliament of 1376.Ruddick 94. The post-1399 versions are notable by their clear pro-Lancastrian bias and focus on King Henry V's victories in France, for example at Rouen, for the purposes of propaganda.Gransden 467.Kennedy 1999, 28. However, even these later versions still contained much of the earlier legendary material, such as that of Albina;Ruddick 69. indeed, the prose versions have been described as being \\"enthusiastic\\" in its rendition of these aspects of English history.Spence 75. It has also been described as \\"one of the best records of rumours and propaganda, if not of the event themselves.\\"  Medieval publication history  There are fifty versions in Anglo-Norman, in forty-nine manuscripts, in various versions and stages.Matheson 1‚Äì5.

From the fifteenth century there is \\"an amorphous, heterogenous group\\" of texts which are composed of individual's notes and preliminary workings of various areas of the Brut.Gransden ?? The English edition made it the first chronicle to be written in the vernacular since the ninth-century Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.Gransden 73. After the \\"massive scribal activity\\" that produced over 250 extant manuscripts (a \\"vast number for a medieval text\\"Ruddick 39.), the Brut was the first chronicle printed in England. The Brut was one of William Caxton's first printings, and he may have compiled this version himself. Between 1480, when Caxton printed it as the Chronicles of England, and 1528 it went through thirteen editions. As a result, according to Matheson, \\"it is no exaggeration to say that in the late Middle Ages in England the Brut was the standard historical account of British and English history\\".Matheson 8‚Äì9. Tudor historians such as John Stow, Raphael Holinshed, and Edward Hall relied extensively on the Brut, and so, by extension, did William Shakespeare. =Anglo-Norman versions= The Anglo- Norman text was initially intended for a lay audience of the upper class. Likely and certain owners of versions of the Brut included Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick, Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln, Isabella of France (who gave a copy to her son, Edward III of England), and Thomas Ughtred, 1st Baron Ughtred (in his will he left it to his wife). Copies were also listed in the library catalogues of religious houses ‚Äì Fountains Abbey, Hailes Abbey, Clerkenwell Priory, and St Mary's Abbey, York (which had two copies). Matheson lists five manuscripts of continental provenance, produced in France, Flanders, and Lorraine.Matheson 9‚Äì12. =Middle English versions= Outside the traditional lay, upper-class audience, the reach of the Middle English translations of the Brut extended the audience to the merchant class. Landowning gentry with a Middle English copy of the Brut include John Sulyard's father, who passed it on to Henry Bourchier, 2nd Earl of Essex's son Thomas. John Warkworth of Peterhouse, Cambridge, owned a copy (which included the Warkworths Chronicle, named for himKaufman 50‚Äì52.), as did the religious houses St Bartholomew-the-Great and Dartford Priory, among others. Matheson identifies a number of women owners and readers as well: Isabel Alen (niece of vicar William Trouthe), Alice Brice, Elizabeth Dawbne, and Dorothy Helbartun.Matheson 12‚Äì13.  Historiography and publication  The Brut's significance is now seen as being in the fact that it was written by laymen, for laymen, and also that the latter portion, at least, was one of the first chronicles written in the English language; it also occasionally provides historical details not found in other contemporaries' writings.Myers 38. The Brut owned by the Mortimer family in the late fourteenth-century contained their view of their own genealogy (which they also traced back to King Arthur and Brutus).Kennedy 1999, 20. The first scholarly edition of the later- medieval portion was transcribed and edited by J.S. Davies for the Camden Society in 1856, and in 1879 James Gairdner published parts of it relating to the Hundred Years' War in his Historical Recollections of a London Citizen. In 1905, C.S.L. Kingsford published three versions in his Chronicles of London,Myers 42. and the following year F.W.D.

Mission and activities  The network serves as a resource for regulators dealing with safety issues related to the introduction and development of genetically modified organisms. In addition to providing regulators with access to policy briefs and other relevant information online in English and French, the network organizes national and subregional workshops on specific topics. For instance, one-week biosafety courses for African regulators were run by the network in Burkina Faso in November 2013 and in Uganda in July 2014, in partnership with the University of Michigan (USA). Twenty-two regulators from Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe took part in the latter course. In April 2014, the network ran a training workshop in Nigeria at the request of the Federal Ministry of Environment for 44 participants drawn from government ministries, regulatory agencies, universities, and research institutions. The aim was to strengthen the regulatory capacity of institutional biosafety committees. This training was considered important to ensure continued regulatory compliance for ongoing confined field trials and multilocation trials for Maruca- resistant cowpea and biofortified sorghum. The workshop was run in partnership with the International Food Policy Research Institute‚Äôs Program for Biosafety Systems. From 28 April to 2 May 2014, Togo‚Äôs Ministry of Environment and Forest Resources organized a stakeholders‚Äô consultative workshop to validate Togo‚Äôs revised biosafety law. Around 60 participants took part, including government officials, researchers, lawyers, biosafety regulators and civil society representatives; the workshop was chaired by a member of the National Biosafety Committee. The aim of the draft bill was to align Togo‚Äôs biosafety law signed in January 2009 with international biosafety regulations and best practices, especially the Nagoya Kuala Lumpur Supplementary Protocol on Liability and Redress that Togo had signed in September 2011. The validation workshop was a critical step before the new bill could be tabled at the National Assembly for adoption later that year. In June 2014, the network organized a four-day study tour to South Africa for ten regulators and policy- makers from Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe. The main objective was to allow them to interact directly with their peers and industrial practitioners in South Africa. The study tour was organized under the auspices of the NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency, in partnership with the Southern Africa Network for Biosciences (SANBio).

Cape of Storms, Essay in Law Microscopy  = Synopsis = The work applies an analytical approach to addressing issues that the philosophy and sociology of law deal with most often as a global vision of complex realities. The author describes an element common to the juridical phenomenon. For this basic building block or elementary particle he has coined the term \\"jureme\\". He explores the various positions, transformations and combinations of the jureme. He hypothesizes that a microscopic examination allows the fitting of their diversity of structures and forms, with a basic similarity of composition. The methodology employs the radical distinction between what is (effective rule) and what should be (fair rule) as well as the constant concern to isolate and to make apparent what, in the way the law is expressed, tends to show it in its best light (\\"nimbe\\"). = Analysis = The title refers to an expression used by Italian philosopher Norberto Bobbio. Lucien Fran√ßois attempts to characterize the difference between a law and an ultimatum from for example, a bandit demanding \\"your money or your life !\\" One possible claim is that by its nature, law cannot stray from justice. Rejecting this claim by acknowledging the law's defects requires a substitute, thus the title. Lucien Fran√ßois suggests that such an analysis requires a \\"microscopic\\" method, proceeding from the simple to the complex. He starts by describing minutely the smallest specific legal element and then shows how this irreducible particle allows, through a series of transformations and combinations, the composition of any legal phenomenon. The book‚Äôs starting point is that the State and the law are readily spoken about without precise definitions. Such definitions are critical because legal science is dogged by a persistent vagueness in its aims. This uncertainty extends to the notion of legal rules and legal norms. He crafts a new vocabulary for discussing law, seeking abstraction and precision, in attempt to avoid the imprecision of conventional terms. The most important new term is \\"jureme\\", referring to the smallest component of any legal phenomenon (replacing \\"legal norm\\"), adapting linguistics' phoneme. Franc claims that the term legal norm is a jumble of quotations from the statute book and statements combining statutes and court rulings, a hotch potch of preliminary messages and final injunctions, of permanent or temporary, general or particular requirements. Jureme is defined as: ¬´ Any appearance, produced by a human being, of a wish to obtain a certain behavioural response in another human being, appearance which is equipped with a mechanism such that as soon as one of the addressees resists, pressure by the threat of a sanction is exerted in the opposite direction ¬ª. He asserts that conventional legal language was developed for pragmatic purposes rather than in the service of science, for convenience rather than formal clarity. Jurists express themselves with conventional language to mirror the rules and communicate with those who formulate them rather than the way in which this language is perceived by the addressees. Fran√ßois highlights at each stage of his progression the processes that form what he calls the \\"nimbe\\" (aura). This is the image that power projects of itself and of its will in an effort to persuade by its choice of words and artifices. At the beginning of this progression, he presents a brief encounter containing only an order backed up by a threat. At the end of this progression he shows how the modern State and of international coexistence come into play. Each chapter tackles one step and analyses its mechanisms and possible improvements. Fran√ßois is convinced that legal theoreticians miss many points ‚Äì as in many law books ‚Äì if they begin their study of the huge and complex building blocks that States constitute with a prematurely synthetic approach. This kind of study might mislead because does not sufficiently avoid preconceived ideas. Some legal systems contrast law and fact: for example, they distinguish between legal and factual powers, powers de jure as opposed to powers de facto. By so doing they show that they have a greater regard for the former than for the latter. This way of looking at the law may give the impression that the law lies somewhere else than in the realm of facts. Fran√ßois constructs the increasingly complicated structures of juridical systems from facts alone. The book's first part, Prol√©gom√®nes, consists of seven short chapters in which the author claims that concepts commonly used in the so-called theory of law are inadequate and concludes that it is best not to use the term \\"law\\" at all. In the third part, entitled Epilogue, Fran√ßois reconsiders his approach and summarizes what has been achieved. The second part is the book's core, titled Exercice sur le jur√®me. Its main title By Agreement or by Force encapsulates the essential way in which law works. In the eighth chapter the author constructs his concept of the jureme. These elements appear in their simplest form in chapter 9, Brief Encounters between Two People, which deals with the basic occurrences of the jureme, where the essential characteristics of what the author calls ¬´ the notification system ¬ª become apparent. In chapter 10, the jureme is examined in lasting relationships. This introduction of relative permanence complicates the notification system. He groups juremes in families. These ¬´ archemes ¬ª play an essential role. Chapter 11 introduces multiple subjects/addressees and further complicates the notification system. Chapter 12 extends the jur√®me through ¬´ capacitation ¬ª. Chapter 13 requires the longest developments discussing the cooperation between non-delegated powers, under a great variety of forms, from people waiting in line to organizations functioning on a hierarchical basis. Chapter 14 adds one more element that is required to create an embryonic juridical State system, namely, the ¬´ jureme of supremacy ¬ª emitted by the ¬´ dominant aggregate ¬ª. Finally, in chapter 15, the developed State and international coexistence appear. In the course of this progression, the microscopic method throws new light on many legal institutions and constructions, including the legal nature (nature juridique) of things, the notions of legal persona or corporate personality, of nullity, delegation, territory, interpretation, the presumption of legislative rationality, freedoms, revolution, coup d‚ÄôEtat and the role of judges. One of the most difficult issues is to know whether imperatives can exist without an (identifiable) imperator. Fran√ßois began each chapter in this part with one or more anecdotes that illustrate his points. These portray imaginary factual situations pertaining to practical cases. = Reception = At a university symposium on this book, the author was introduced as someone who \\" lifts the veil, debunks fictions, dismantles artifices in order to get to the bottom of real relationships of power\\" (E. Delruelle). In the last years of a long legal career, Lucien Fran√ßois has thought long and hard about this work, which critics have judged \\" highly original\\" (F. Glansdorff), \\"of rare lucidity \\" (D. Pi√©rard), endeavouring to \\"provide us with an analytical grid of how people in authority behave\\" (P. Martens) ; an \\"astringent\\" text displaying \\"implacable rigour\\" (J.-M. Belorgey), \\"a far-reaching and exacting reflection tied up with the ambition of formulating a global explanatory approach to legal phenomena\\" in a legal theory too often willing to welcome \\" fast thinkers\\" (N. Thirion), an \\"exercise in demystification of the law by the law\\", crucial \\" in any debate on law and justice, for any future appreciation of the norm and its legitimacy\\" and useful \\"as much for law professors as for legal sociologists, anthropologists and law historians, because it represents a rigorous tool of analysis that poses pertinent questions while systematically answering them\\" (S. Cacciaguidi-Fahy) ; \\"The language of law was not universal ; by redefining its legal field it becomes universal. Now the legal sciences are equipped with a conceptual apparatus which enables the analysis of any human society\\" (R. Jacob); \\"a formidable power of persuasion \\"(P. Mayer); \\"Lucien Fran√ßois goes beyond appearances\\" (P. Brunet)  Recognition  * Grand Cross Order of Leopold II. * Grand officier de l'Ordre de la Couronne. * Commandeur de l‚ÄôOrdre de L√©opold.

It is in oil on canvas and measures . It shows a road leading to the village of Middelharnis on the island of Goeree-Overflakkee in the Maas delta in South Holland, the Netherlands. The painting has long been one of the best-known Dutch landscape paintings,Langmuir, 205 and certainly Hobbema's best-known work,L√∂rzing, 42 at least in the English-speaking world: \\"it is as if the artist had produced only a single picture\\" according to Christopher Lloyd.Lloyd, 77 Cornelis Hofstede de Groot, the great specialist of a century ago, thought it \\"the finest picture, next to Rembrandt's Syndics, which has been painted in Holland\\".Lloyd, 77 According to Michael Levey, \\"it occupies a position in painting somewhat equivalent to that in poetry of Gray's Elegy,Levey, 151 and for Seymour Slive \\"it is the swan song of Holland's great period of landscape painting which fully deserves its high reputation.\\"Slive, 207 For Gerald Reitlinger, it \\"soars above the other nine National Gallery Hobbemas\\".Reitlinger, 338 (now the NG only recognises 9 Hobbemas in total in its collection) The untypically symmetrical and frontal composition of the painting appears to record very accurately the view Hobbema saw;Levey, 151; MacLaren, 177; Slive, 206 the alder trees along the road were planted in 1664.Levey, 151 It is signed and dated in the reflection on the ditch at right: \\"M:hobbema/f 1689\\", MacLaren, 177 over twenty years after Hobbema largely gave up painting,MacLaren, 175; Slive, 206 and right at the end of the Dutch Golden Age landscape period.Langmuir, 205; Slive, 206‚Äì207, and the rest of his chapter. Description The village is seen from the south-east. The road was called the Boomgaardweg, but is now the Steene Weg.MacLaren, 177; Boomgaardweg on this map from 1866, directly below the title \\"Middelharnis\\"; The top of the church tower has been rebuilt, and the spire was removed by the French in 1811 to make a semaphore station, connecting The Hague with Paris. The smaller tower to the right of the church, seen between the trees, is the town hall, built in 1639, and the barn to the right survived until the 1870s.MacLaren, 177 The village lies on the edge of the island and was a fishing port; ships' masts and a beacon with a tripod support can be seen in the distance to the right of the avenue, on the beach facing the Haringvliet.MacLaren, 176 This was then a salt-water channel, but has been dammed and turned into a fresh-water lake in modern times. The island was detached from the mainland when the Haringvliet formed as a result of two major flooding events. The first was in 1216, which breached the dunes of Voorne and created a deep saltwater inlet. In the St. Elizabeth floods of 1421, this inlet connected to the Merwede and became an important estuary of the Rhine and Meuse rivers. Context Aelbert Cuyp, The Avenue at Meerdervoort, 1650‚Äì1652, Wallace Collection Meindert Hobbema (1638‚Äì1709) was a pupil of Jacob van Ruisdael, the pre-eminent landscape painter of the Dutch Golden Age, and in his mature period produced paintings developing one aspect of his master's more varied output, showing very different scenes from this painting. Hobbema specialized in \\"sunny forest scenes opened by roads and glistening ponds, fairly flat landscapes with scattered tree groups, and water mills\\", including over thirty of the last in paintings.Slive, 206 quoted; Loughman His paths or roads normally wind diagonally across his composition through dense trees and vegetation, the trees spreading and varying in size. The water mills and other buildings are generally seen in the near distance, rather as the barn is here, and generally only one or two appear in each picture. His compositions are carefully contrived and presumably imaginary, avoiding all symmetry. This painting is a surprising break from most of these somewhat \\"tired conventions of his earlier work\\".Langmuir, 205 In contrast to his usual scenes of rough woodland, in this scene the straight lines, lopped trees, deep drainage ditches on both sides of the road, and regimented young trees in the plot to the right, all emphasize the man-made nature of this landscape.Loughman; L√∂rzing, 42‚Äì49 A patch of rough woodland remains in the left foreground, contrasting with the saplings in rows on the right. The man tending to these is unusual in 17th-century Dutch landscapes, which rarely show anyone working the land.Loughman What brought Hobbema to this rather out- of-the-way location remains unknown. In contrast to this accurate depiction of a specific place, it is thought that his compositions were usually assembled and painted in the studio from a number of different elements presumably recorded in drawings, and not all coming from the same place; there are often several versions changing parts of the composition.Loughman; Getty, 65 Middelharnis church tower in 2015 In 1668 he married and took the well-paid position of \\"wine-gauger\\" for the Amsterdam octroi, assessing and collecting local taxes on wine, holding this until his death. It is clear that his painting greatly reduced from this point, but it did not end completely, as used to be thought. The quality of his work becomes uneven, though this is not the only very successful late work.Slive, 206; MacLaren, 178 Hofstede de Groot, like others at the time, believed Hobbema had completely stopped painting before the 1680s, and was sure the date read 1669. Subsequent cleaning, and the discovery that the alder trees were only planted by the council in 1664, has confirmed that 1689 is the correct date.Slive, 206‚Äì207 Composition The unusually centralized composition carries the viewer's eye down the road, and the thin, very tall lopped trees unite the sky and the land. The head of the gentleman with his dog is at a level with the vanishing point of the perspective, and very close to it. He is a hunter, with a gun sloped over his shoulder, and a satchel for his game.Langmuir, 205‚Äì206; Slive, 206 The \\"dark patches of ground and vegetation to the left and right of the road echo and reinforce the horizon line and counteract the inward pull of the perspective.\\"Langmuir, 206 In 1980 x-ray radiography revealed that Hobbema had originally placed another tree in the foreground on each side of the avenue, but then painted these over.MacLaren, 177; illustrated in Vol II, figure 41 Erica Langmuir suggests that the two additional trees at the front were painted over because Hobbema decided that they would have \\"screened off the background from the foreground at the sides of the painting while exaggerating the 'rush' to the vanishing point in the centre.\\" She suggests testing this by holding pencils over a reproduction.Langmuir, 205 For Seymour Slive the painting has \\"the exalted spaciousness which often characterizes the Late Baroque, and also a kind of elegance in the elongated, slender trees that goes with the taste of this phase\\".Slive, 207 Though unusual, there had been a few previous compositions with \\"a strongly foreshortened road lined with trees in a wide flat landscape\\". Aelbert Cuyp had painted The Avenue at Meerdervoort in 1650‚Äì1652 (now in the Wallace Collection). Condition It was perhaps because the two painted-over trees in the foreground had begun to show through that the sky was extensively repainted in the 19th century. This was realized in 1972 after analysis of the pigments used found synthetic ultramarine and chrome yellow in the sky, which had not yet been invented in the 1680s. A 19th-century restorer may have attempted to bring back the two trees, before thinking better of it, as Hobbema himself had done.MacLaren, 176‚Äì177 The sky was largely repainted in 1951, much of which was removed in 1972, which \\"gave the painting an unsatisfactory appearance\\", so in 1980‚Äì81 all the 1951 repainting was removed and new retouches added. In contrast the landscape and trees are \\"very well preserved\\", although the colour balance of the greens has probably altered to give a \\"lighter and bluer shade of green than originally intended\\".MacLaren, 176‚Äì177 Provenance The Avenue, Sydenham by Camille Pissarro, painted in 1871, just after the National Gallery acquired the Hobbema Nearly a century after being painted it was still on the island, in a collection in nearby Sommelsdijk, suggesting it had been commissioned by a local patron.MacLaren, 178. Where it was painted is a different matter. Hobbema is thought to have normally painted up his works in his Amstedam studio, using drawings made on the scene, though very few survive. After the death of the collector in 1782 it was bought by the Middelharnis council and hung in the town hall until 1822. It was then exchanged with an obscure painter for a copy and another landscape painting, both by him. It then moved through the art trade, increasing rapidly in price, and reached Edinburgh in Scotland in 1826.MacLaren, 178 Hobbema had been little appreciated and cheap in the 18th century, but his pictures were in tune with Romantic and later 19th-century taste, and prices rose accordingly through the 19th century.Loughman; Reitlinger, 338-229. He records sales in Holland in 1815 for the equivalent of ¬£90, and to Peel in 1829 for ¬£840. These do not exactly tally with the information in MacLaren. In 1829 it was auctioned in Edinburgh for 195 guineas, already a good price, then taken to London and cleaned.MacLaren, 178; Reitlinger, 139 It then fetched ¬£800, and by 1834 was in the collection of Sir Robert Peel, 2nd Baronet, who had a significant collection of Dutch paintings, but is better known for having twice been Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 1834‚Äì1835 and 1841‚Äì1846. It was exhibited at the British Institution in 1835, and in March 1871 entered the National Gallery as NG 830 when they bought seventy-seven pictures and eighteen drawings from the Peel Collection. These were bought from Peel's son Robert, the 3rd Baronet for ¬£75,000, with a special grant from the government,MacLaren, 178 and catalogued as NG 818 to 894.NG Archive record; \\"Some works in the Peel Collection have been transferred to the British Museum, the National Portrait Gallery and the Tate Gallery\\". The Avenue, Sydenham by Camille Pissarro was painted during a stay in London that ended in June 1871, a month after the National Gallery acquired the Hobbema, and its composition is probably influenced by it.Langmuir, 309‚Äì311 Pissarro was then living in the London village, turning into a suburb, of Upper Norwood, next to Sydenham, avoiding the Franco-Prussian War. This painting is also now in the National Gallery. Notes References *\\"Getty\\": Masterpieces of Painting in the J. Paul Getty Museum, ed.

Zadikow studied under the neoclassical sculptor Heinrich Wader√© and mainly worked on portrait busts, gravestones and plaques. He was a soldier on the Western Front during the Great War and sustained combat injuries in 1917 before being taken to a British prisoner of war camp. After the war, he dwelt mainly in Munich and Rome, but briefly worked in Paris in 1932. Zadikow liked to work with biblical motifs, and his sculpture of the young David was displayed in the entrance of the Berlin Jewish Museum in 1933. Considered his most important work, the statue was lost during the Second World War. In 1933, sensing trouble for Germany's Jewish population, Zadikow moved to Prague with his wife Hilda and their daughter Marianka. He was later joined by other German artists such as Oskar Kokoschka, John Heartfield and Thomas Theodor Heine. In the wake of the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1939, Jews in the country faced increasing persecution, and finally on the 15th May 1942, the Zadikows were rounded up and ordered to board a train to Theresienstadt concentration camp, where Arnold was to pass away. Hilda and Marianka were transported to Auschwitz-Birkenau the following year, but managed to survive long enough to be liberated in 1945. Throughout his working life, Zadikow designed decorative gravestones, including that of the German physician and pioneering sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld. The upright headstone in gray granite is inset with a bronze bas-relief portrait of Hirschfeld in profile and the slab covering the tomb is engraved with Hirschfeld's Latin motto, \\"Per Scientiam ad Justitiam\\". Whilst in Paris, he was also commissioned by Albert Einstein to produce a headstone for a family member. According to Zadikow's daughter, Marianka, Einstein provided the family with an affidavit for use in an immigration application for the US; although Zadikow was unable to afford the visa. The Statue of The Young David Created in 1921, Zadikow's statue in stone of The Young David was the centrepiece of the entrance to Berlin's Jewish Museum, when it opened in 1933 on the eve of the Nazi accession to power. Zadikow presented the biblical motif of David, carrying slingshot; a muscular warrior, that adhered to contemporary German conceptions of male beauty. The figure of David represented Jewish military prowess, leading to Zadikow to remark of his work that Das ist meine Antwort an Hitler und die Nazis or \\"This is my answer to Hitler and the Nazis\\". The statue was displayed at a time that Jews were being portrayed as ugly and avaricious in common discourse. Considered degenerate by the Nazi regime and out of line with its prescribed aestheticism, the sculpture was eventually destroyed along with other pieces of his work in 1942. =Work= File:The other side of the medalDSCF9932.JPGDeath and the Cannon by Arnold Zadikow 1915, British Museum exhibition: \\"The other side of the medal: how Germany saw the First World War\\", 9 May ‚Äì 23 November 2014 File:Tomb of Magnus Hirschfeld, Caucade Cemetery (Nice, France).jpgThe headstone features a bronze bas-relief portrait of Hirschfeld in profile  Notes  Category:German Jews Category:1943 deaths Category:1884 births Category:20th-century sculptors Category:20th-century German sculptors Category:20th-century male artists Category:German medallists ","title":"Arnold Zadikow"},{"id":"53931075","text":"All Things Await All Things Await is a novel written by American author Seth Clabough, published by Savant Books in June 2016.

It traces its history to a corps of the Soviet Air Defence Forces, and later the Russian Air Force. The corps was headquartered at Severomorsk and was part of the 10th Air Defence Army from 1960 to 1994. It was formed as the Northern Air Defence Corps in 1957 and was assigned the designation \\"21st\\" three years later. It became a brigade in 2009 and was converted into a division in 2014. History The corps was originally established as the Northern Air Defence Corps in February 1957 with headquarters at Severomorsk, Murmansk Oblast, part of the Northern Air Defence Army. On 21 March 1960 it gained a combined-arms number as the 21st Air Defence Corps, and at the same time the Northern Air Defence Army became the 10th Air Defence Army. The corps included an anti-aircraft missile regiment with a headquarters in Murmansk (the only military unit in this city), the 5th Radio Technical Brigade with headquarters in Severomorsk, and fighter air regiments based on airfields Kilp-yavr, Afrikanda and Monchegorsk. In April 1978, corps commander Vladimir Tsarkov ordered an Su-15 pilot to shoot down Korean Air Lines Flight 902 after the plane failed to respond to repeated orders to land, and approached the Soviet border with Finland. The Su-15 opened fire, forcing the plane to descend, and killing two of the 109 passengers and crew members aboard Flight 902. The plane made an emergency landing on the frozen Korpiyarvi lake (not to be confused with the Korpij√§rvi lake) near the Finnish border. The 10th Air Defence Army disbanded in December 1994, and the corps transferred to the 6th Separate Air Defence Army, which became the 6th Air and Air Defence Forces Army in 1998. In 2009, the formation became the 1st Aerospace Defence Brigade, and the 6th Army became the 1st Air and Air Defence Forces Command. In December 2014, the brigade was converted, along like other aerospace defence brigades, into the 1st Air Defence Division, and became part of the Arctic Joint Strategic Command. The division became part of the Northern Fleet by early 2017. Composition In 1988, the corps included: *223rd Communication Center (Severomorsk, Murmansk Oblast) *174th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment PVO (Monchegorsk, Murmansk Oblast) *431st Fighter Aviation Regiment PVO (Afrikanda, Murmansk Oblast) *941st Fighter Aviation Regiment PVO (Kilp-Yavr, Murmansk Oblast) *39th Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade (Olenegorsk, Murmansk Oblast) *42nd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade (Polyarny, Murmansk Oblast) *116th Guards Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade (Bolshoye Ozerko, Murmansk Oblast) *224th Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade (Gremikha, Murmansk Oblast) *864th Anti-Aircraft Missile Regiment (Murmansk, Murmansk Oblast) *5th Radio-Technical Brigade (Severomorsk, Murmansk Oblast) *502nd independent Electronic Warfare Battalion (Kildinstroy, Murmansk Oblast) References  External links  * http://www.redstar.ru/index.php/advice/item/14532-strazhi-zapolyarya * http://www.mvestnik.ru/army/pid20120208451l/ * http://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=674921 * http://www.redstar.ru/index.php/syria/item/32791-nebo-nad-arktikoj Category:Divisions of Russia Category:Air defence divisions Category:Units and formations of the Russian Air Force Category:Military units and formations established in 2014 ","title":"1st Air Defence Division (Russia)"},{"id":"53931174","text":"Typical wiped joints, to form junctions in lead pipe A wiped joint is a form of soldered joint used to join lead pipework.  Process  The defining characteristic of a wiped joint is that the soldering process involves mechanically working or 'wiping' the joint. As well as heating solder and applying it to the joint, the solder is shaped into place manually, wiping it with a non-metallic tool to form a smooth-surfaced outer shape. This relies on the use of a lead-tin solder with a wide eutectic range. This is an alloy composition that when heated and melted has a large range where it is neither fully solid nor fully liquid, but is an equilibrium mixture of both solid and liquid simultaneously. The resultant 'pasty' texture and mechanical fluidity allows the joint to be wiped to shape. The solder grade used for leadworking is plumber's solder (80% lead / 20% tin). Although this is thought of as a high melting point solder amongst lead-tin solders, the solidus is relatively constant for all of these solders and it is the liquidus which climbs from the eutectic point at Sn 63% / Pb 37%. = Technique = For pipework, the two parts are first formed to shape so as to fit closely. As lead is a ductile metal, this was easily done by hand using a variety of mallets and shaped sticks. Wooden cones could also be used to stretch the diameter of one pipe so that another of nominally the same size could now fit within it. The metal was then cleaned by scraping off the surface, then protecting it with a flux of tallow. Areas that should not receive any lead were painted with plumbers soil which was a mixture of lampblack and glue; or flour, salt, sugar and water. The lead would not stick to it, and the plumbers soil would be washed off later. Heat was applied with a blowtorch and when the joint was hot, the end of a bar of solder was applied and melted onto the joint. The molten solder gives a 'pasty' behaviour, owing to its eutectic properties and can be worked for some time before it hardens. Shaping was done with either a 'moleskin', a heat-resistant pad of cotton cloth, covered with tallow, or else a wooden stick, also greased with tallow.  Applications  = Plumbing = Wiped joints were used for centuries to install water plumbing and similar joints can be seen in Roman plumbing. As the wiping technique allowed a great deal of on-site flexibility for the style and dimensions of the work produced, this meant that plumbers needed few parts other than pipe, lead sheet and solder. Large and complex joints could all be made by the artisan's skill alone. With the development of copper plumbing, many different types and sizes of factory- made plumbing fitting were needed, which would be assembled on site rather than fabricated from raw materials. In the later years of lead plumbing, it was recognised that the health effects of lead piping were a problem for drinking water, especially in soft water areas. Tin-lined lead pipes were used, soldered over a thin brass joint liner. These needed care when wiping the joint, in order to not overheat them and melt the tin layer. Copper to lead joints may be made by wiping the lead onto the copper pipe, as for a lead-lead joint. However the Pb80Sn20 solder used for wiping is poorly wetting onto copper, and so that must be tinned first, using a more tin-rich solder and an active flux. = Underground cables = Lead-sheathed cables were also used for telephone cables, as the lead outer sheath lasted well buried in wet ground. Jointing such cables could also require wiped lead joints. A typical such joint would involve a joint or tee junction between cables, with the copper pairs inside joined by fine soldering and insulating, then the overall joint wrapped in lead sheet and soldered. Such jointing continued until the 1960s and the availability of polyethylene sheathed cables. Wiped joints continue to be made for as long as there are lead pipes in service. Although lead pipework is now rare, for health reasons, wiping a joint remains the usual way of joining it. Commonly though a joint is to be made by shortening the old lead and installing new copper or plastic piping beyond the joint. These joints are usually made today with a proprietary mechanical joint, sealing onto the soft lead by some mechanical compression ring. = Car bodywork = An older technique for body filler on car bodywork, before the plastic age, was the use of body solder. This was a lead-based wiping technique to fill gaps and low spots in steel bodywork, by applying solder with a similar wiping technique and a wooden paddle. The solder used was of even lower tin content, around 10%.

His siblings included LeRoy King, Jr., who married Mary Isabel Lockwood (daughter of Benoni Lockwood), Katharine Bulkeley Lawrence (niece of Edward H. Bulkeley), and Pamela Anne Sutherland Woodbury (daughter of George Henry Sutherland); and art collector Ethel Marjory King, who married Charles Howland Russell. The Kings' Newport residence was designed for his father by Stanford White, at the corner of Berkeley and Bellevue Avenues. His paternal grandparents were Edward King and Mary Augusta (n√©e LeRoy) King. Through his father, he was a direct descendant of both Nicholas Fish and Peter Stuyvesant, the last Dutch Director-General of New Netherland. His great-aunt, Elizabeth Stuyvesant (n√©e LeRoy) Dresser was the mother of D. LeRoy Dresser and Edith Stuyvesant Dresser, who was married to George Washington Vanderbilt II and, later, U.S. Senator from Rhode Island, Peter Goelet Gerry. His maternal grandparents were Frederic William Rhinelander, trustee and the president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Frances Davenport (n√©e Skinner) Rhinelander. King's mother was Edith Wharton's first cousin and King served as the executor of Wharton's American estate. He was educated at St. George's School, Newport after which he entered Harvard College, where he graduated from in 1908 with a Bachelor of Arts cum laude. He then studied architecture at Columbia University from 1908-1911, followed by studies at the prestigious √âcole des Beaux-Arts, in Paris, from 1912-1914. Career King apprenticed at the prominent beaux-arts architecture firm McKim, Mead & White from 1914‚Äì1917, and was associated with architect Lawrence Grant White between 1915 and 1917. His career was interrupted by the First World War. He served with the American Red Cross Commission in 1917, and following America's entry into the war, served as First Lieutenant in the US Army from 1918 until 1919. Following the war, King continued his apprenticeship at the architecture firm Carr√®re and Hastings from 1919-1920. He formed an association in 1920 with the architect Marion Sims Wyeth, a friend from his student days in Paris. They formally joined in partnership in 1932, known as Wyeth and King and after 1944 as Wyeth, King and Johnson.An early reference to Wyeth, King & Johnson is: The Palm Beach Post, August 26, 1945, page 2. Generally speaking, Wyeth and Johnson were responsible for the work in Florida, while King was responsible for the work in Newport and New York City.

Content The book examines the arrival of Bengali sellers in Harlem in the early part of the 20th century. The establishment of a Bengali neighborhood in Harlem in the 1920s. The book also examines the arrival of Bengali Muslim settlers in Treme, New Orleans. The book was inspired by Habib Ullah, a sailor from Noakhali who settled in Harlem in the 1930s. The book examines passenger records and census papers to picture the life of early Bengali settlers and how they settled to largely African-American neighborhoods because of racial segregation then.

He has been consulted as an expert by major media outlets including Al Jazeera, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Foreign Affairs, The Washington Post, and others. He authored a major report published by the New York Times in partnership with George Washington University in their 2020 series, \\"The ISIS report\\". He has faced criticism over his alleged sympathies towards ISIL in his work, as well as his conduct and alleged close relationships with ISIL fighters. Education Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi studied Classics and Oriental Studies at Brasenose College, University of Oxford. He earned his degree there. In March 2020 he was a doctoral candidate at Swansea University. Early life His family is originally from Mosul, Iraq, his father is Shiite and his mother Sunni. Early career In an otherwise scathing 2014 Business Insider article, Armin Rosen, described then 21-year- old Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi as one of \\"the fastest rising stars in his field ‚Äî his online connections and self-presentation to jihadists he was attempting to mine for information.\\" Rosen wrote that Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi was then a \\"recent graduate of Oxford University\\" had already \\"become a widely-cited public authority on jihadist groups in Iraq and Syria while still completing his undergraduate studies\\" at Brasenose College, University of Oxford. The Insider article said that, by 2014, Tamimi had been \\"generally considered a leading public authority on jihadist groups in Iraq and Syria.\\" Middle East expert His work has focused on \\"militant groups of all affiliations in Iraq and Syria, with particular interest in those of jihadist orientation\\". His work is regularly quoted in media including Al Jazeera, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Foreign Affairs, The Washington Post, 'Associated Press, and other publications. He is listed as an expert by the Middle East Institute (MEI) and has been a guest contributor. According to the MEI, has been \\"cited in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, The Times (London), the Washington Post, and other publications.\\" His work is has also been regularly quoted in media including Al Jazeera, and Foreign Affairs and other publications. In a November 14, 2019 New York Times article, al-Tamimi, was described as an \\"independent Syria researcher\\" who was consulted by the Times as an expert on ISIS. The New York Times, Washington Post, and Associated Press have published Al-Tamimi's \\"insights on the Islamic State, Iraq, and Syria\\", according to a March 2020 report in the The Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP or TWI). =UK House of Commons Defence Committee= He has appeared before the UK House of Commons Defence Committee to advise on the Islamic State and Iraq. He has been described as \\"one of the fastest rising stars in his field\\" and \\"a widely-cited public authority on jihadist groups in Iraq and Syria.\\" Major stories His report entitled \\"The Islamic State's Real Estate Department: Documents and Analysis\\" was published by The New York Times and George Washington University as part of the University's Program on Extremism. The Times and the University had joined in an \\"exclusive partnership\\" to \\"digitize, translate, analyze, and publish\\" over 15,000 files, now known as \\"The ISIS Files\\"‚Äîwhich had been obtained by the investigative journalist Rukmini Callimachi and her \\"Iraqi colleagues during embeds with the Iraqi army\\". The Time and the university had announced their intention to make the ISIS files public in 2018 and published them online in June 2020. The VOA news published an article saying that a \\"prominent Islamic scholar\\" had been \\"charged with rape in France\\". An in-depth 30 December 2015 report in the Washington Post, which included an interview with Al-Tamimi, presented extensive evidence that documents that were leaked and purported to prove that the Islamic State was weakening, were fake? Al-Tamimi whose research on the Islamic State is considerable said that suggestions that he write a book were premature. \\"Just as the best histories of Nazi Germany have been written well after the Second World War with archives of documents made available to researchers, so I apply the same reasoning to analyzing the Islamic State. As researchers we need to be aware of the limits of our capabilities in obtaining information.\\" His reports on the Khalid ibn al-Walid Army in Syria in 2016 and 2017 were published by the Rubin Center. A March 2020 report entitled \\"Honored, Not Contained: The Future of Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces\\", which he co-authored with Michael Knights and Hamdi Malik, was published by The Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP or TWI). Unethical methods to track jihadists (2013 ‚Äì 2014)  Armin Rosen, who was then Business Insider ' senior writer for defense and the military, wrote a scathing article that the \\"young terrorism analyst's\\" \\"career had come \\"apart in public\\". Rosen raised concerns that Tamimi had provided rhetorical support to ISIS supporters and members. Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi responded to the accusations in his personal blog under his own name \\"Aymenn Jawad Al- Tamimi\\", which is self-described as Pundicity: Informed Opinion and Review. Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi admitted in a 22 July 2014 blog post entitled, Reflections on Methods\\" that, \\"[While] this indeed garnered some valuable information (eg it helped [him] first identify Moroccan ex-Gitmo detainee Muhammad Mizouz and his presence in Syria), it was also unethical, pure and simple.\\" He defended his actions by saying that, for over the year that he was engaged in these activities, he had been \\"intensely tracking the jihadist group the Islamic State (formerly ISIS)\\" on both \\"Twitter and in [his] analytical articles for over a year. He said that he did so to \\"gain the confidence of these circles\\" by \\"feign[ing] sympathy for their views.\\" He wrote that he had \\"adopted a 'jihadi persona' in communications with them\\". In a 22 July 2014 blog post wrote a reflection on his methods for accessing information about ISIS. =Background= On 14 July 2014, Jonathan Krohn and Al Tamimi co-authored an article which had attempted to disprove evidence presented by the American journalist Michael Weiss in his 23 June 2014 Foreign Policy article, which claimed that Iran was aiding ISIS. Weiss wrote that while \\"American talking heads\\" said that Iran was the \\"key to defeating ISIS\\", that \\"those in the know\\" said \\"the two \\"enemies\\" were \\"actually secret allies\\". Weiss' 2014 claim appears to be erroneous according to a 4 January 2019 New York Times article.A 4 January 2020 New York Times article said \\"The Iraqi government established after the United States invasion in 2003 has long struggled to balance its dependence on Washington and the West against its close ties to its neighbor Iran. The Iraqi government in Baghdad relied heavily on those Iranian-backed militias in the fight against ISIS.\\" This differing of opinions of the three analyst's provided the backdrop for Rosen's 14 July 2014 Insider article . =Responses to revelations about the unethical methods Al-Tamimi had used in 2013-2014= Weiss provided evidence of a conversation in which Tamimi told an ISIS supporter that it was \\"best not openly tweeting\\" support for the Islamic State. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross called the exchange \\"pretty disturbing\\" while Jonathan Krohn said \\"had I known this I would not have published anything with him in the first place.\\" According to University of Maryland professor Phillip Smyth, \\"One crosses the line when one starts to, under their real name and in full view of the general public, kind of act like a jihadi and say that they are a jihadi.\\" Rosen included a list of Tamimi's questionable online communications with ISIS members including the Indian Islamic State supporter Mehdi Masroor Biswas (known online as @ShamiWitness), currently imprisoned in his home country, whom Tamimi called 'brother' and 'friend'. Rosen listed a Shami witness Biswas article that Tamimi had posted on his personal blog \\"Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi\\" described as Pundicity: Informed Opinion and Review. He claimed to know the British Islamic State fighter Raphael Hostey ('Abu Qaqa') personally. Among other posts Tamimi made on Twitter were ones claiming \\"one day even the Kaaba in Mecca will be covered with the ISIS banner\\" and \\"Dawla Islamiya (Islamic State) will take over the whole world\\". Rosen reported that academics and researchers, including Aaron Zelin, Phillip Smyth, Daveed Gartenstein-Ross and Eliot Higgins condemned Tamimi's actions. \\"He's presenting two different sides of himself to different audiences,\\" Berger told Business Insider. \\"He's presenting himself to us as part of this analyst community, and he's presenting himself to ISIS sources as someone who is supportive of their political goals. Both of those things really can't be true. So it creates a problem.\\" Rosen cited Aaron Zelin, who had blacklisted Tamimi and removed all his work from his website Jihadology, [H]is [Tamimi's] analysis had become \\"more and more just pushing that narrative of the groups [ISIS] themselves.\\" In response to Rosen's article, Bellingcat immediately removed an article by Tamimi in which he defended the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, claiming it had no relation to al-Qaeda and that the rise of IS was a legitimate reaction to the \\"marginalization of Sunnis\\" and the 2013 Hawija clashes. While Tamimi was banned from any further contribution to the site, Bellingcat continued to cite Tamimi as an expert in later articles. In his 2016 Bellingcat report, investigative journalist, Christiaan Triebert cited Aymenn Jawad al-Tamimi, a \\"fellow at the Middle East Forum\\", to clarify any confusion about the management of water infrastructure in Raqqa. Aymenn Jawad al-Tamimi, pointed out that there was no evidence that the Nusra fighters managed Raqqa's water affairs. He said that \\"civilian services were largely the responsibility of the local council while Nusra focused on their war efforts\\". Tamimi responded to Rosen's accusations saying that, \\"I think there‚Äôs something to be said that I did try to ingratiate myself in these circles to get information, I agree that that was unethical.‚Äù Notes References Aymenn Jawad Al- Tamimi's Blog Category:Living people Category:Alumni of Brasenose College, Oxford Category:British people of Iraqi descent Category:Historians of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant Category:Terrorism studies Category:Experts on terrorism Category:1996 births ","title":"Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi"},{"id":"53931419","text":"Komarudin (29 May 1919 ‚Äì 10 August 1949) was an Indonesian freedom fighter during the skirmishes against the Dutch which took place shortly after WW2. It has since come to light that he was born in Korea. His real name is Yang Chil- seong (ÏñëÏπ†ÏÑ±). His Japanese name is Sichisei Yanagawa (Ê¢ÅÂ∑ù‰∏ÉÊòü). He was caught and executed in 1949 by Dutch forces. In July 1995, the Indonesian government and South Korean representatives held a tombstone replacement ceremony in his honor.  Early life  Yang Chil-seong was born on 29 May 1919 in Wanju County, North Jeolla Province. He was commissioned by the Japanese colonial government as a guardian of allied forces in Bandung in 1942. At that time both Korea and Indonesia were being colonized by Japan. After Indonesia and Korea gained independence in 1945, Yang Chil-seong did not return to Korea but remained in Indonesia. He changed his name to Komarudin and married an Indonesian. When the Dutch soldiers returned to Indonesia and launched military aggression, Komarudin came to Garut with two Japanese soldiers from Bandung, joining the Indonesian National Armed Forces. They fought guerrilla warfare in a group dubbed \\"Pasukan Pangeran Papak\\", from Markas Besar Gerilya Galunggung (MBGG). They were led by Major Kosasih and based in Wanaraja, Garut. The two Japanese soldiers named Hasegawa (Abubakar) and Masahiro Aoki (Usman) along with Komarudin were known for their good combat skills. The troops also fought in the event of Bandung Sea of Fire. Komarudin thwarted the Dutch attempt to seize Wanaraja by destroying Cimanuk Bridge.  Caught by Dutch soldiers  When the Dutch attacked Garut, a group of Prince Papak troops were in charge of securing the area, but because the Dutch forces were too big, the Prince Papak troops were forced to retreat. The three guerrillas were hiding but were caught from information by spies. Komarudin, Abubakar, Usman and an Indonesian fighter named Djoehana were caught on Mount Dora. On 10 August 1949, Komarudin, Abubakar and Usman were executed in Kerkhoff, Garut. Djoehana was sentenced to life imprisonment in Cipinang Penitentiary Institution. They were buried in TPU Pasir, Bogor, then in 1975 transferred to the Heroes Cemetery of Tenjolaya, Garut. Komarudin died and left a boy.  Identity disclosure  Previously there was little information about Yang Chil-seong's life in Indonesia. The information about Komarudin, who turned out to be a Korean, was revealed by Japanese and South Korean historians. In addition, testimony was also obtained from fellow comrades Yang Chil-seong who were still alive. In July 1995, the Indonesian government and South Korean representatives held a Komarudin tombstone replacement ceremony militarily. Since then Komarudin has been regarded as one of the leading figures for Indonesia's independence.  References   External links  * Who is Chil- seong, the hero of Indonesian independence?

She showed great promise as a two-year- old in 1985 when she won both of her races in convincing fashion. In the following year she finished third in the Musidora Stakes and fourth in The Oaks before recording her biggest success with an easy win in the Irish Oaks. She was beaten in her two remaining starts and was retired racing at the end of the year. She became an outstanding broodmare, producing the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes winner Opera House, the dual Ascot Gold Cup winner Kayf Tara and the Prix de l'Op√©ra winner Zee Zee Top. Background Colorspin was a \\"tall, lengthy\\" bay mare bred in France by Egon Weinfeld's Hampshire- based Meon Valley Stud. Like the other horses raced by the Meon Valley Stud, Colorspin competed in the black and white colours of Helena Springfield Ltd a company owned by Weinfeld. She was trained by Michael Stoute at his Beech Hurst stables in Newmarket, Suffolk, where she was one of an outstanding group of fillies which also included Sonic Lady and Untold. She was sired by High Top, who won the 2000 Guineas in 1972 and later became a successful breeding stallion whose other progeny included Top Ville, Circus Plume and Cut Above. Her dam Reprocolor won the Lancashire Oaks in 1979 and went on to become one of Meon Valley's three foundation mares alongside One in a Million and Odeon. Apart from Colorspin she produced Cezanne and the Prix de l'Op√©ra winner Bella Colora and she was also the female-line ancestor of Lyric of Light. Racing career =1985: two-year-old season= On her racecourse debut Colorspin contested a nineteen-runner maiden race over six furlongs at Nottingham Racecourse and won by a length from the Henry Cecil-trained Thousand Sails. In October she was moved up in distance for the Listed Rochford Thompson Newbury Stakes over seven and a half furlongs at Newbury Racecourse. She raced in second place before going to the front three furlongs out and won by a length from Salchow with a gap of five lengths back to Chernicherva in third place. =1986: three-year-old season= Colorspin began her second season in the Musidora Stakes (a trial for The Oaks) over ten furlongs at York Racecourse in May and finished third behind Rejuvenate and Ala Mahlik. In the Oaks at Epsom Racecourse on 7 June she was the least fancied of her trainer's three runners and started a 25/1 outsider in a fifteen-runner field. Ridden by Brian Rouse she exceeded expectations as she came home fourth behind Midway Lady, Untold and Maysoon. Pat Eddery took the ride when the filly was sent to Ireland to contest the Irish Oaks on softer ground at the Curragh on 12 July. Untold (the choice of Stoute's stable jockey Walter Swinburn) was made the odds-on favourite ahead of the Pretty Polly Stakes winner Fleur Royale with Colorspin the 6/1 third choice in a field of eight fillies. Ridden with great confidence by Eddery, Colorspin tracked the front-running Fleur Royale before taking the lead a furlong out and won \\"very easily\\" by three lengths with a gap of twelve lengths back to Untold in third place. On 19 August Colorspin, ridden by Swinburn, started 9/4 favourite in a strong renewal of the Yorkshire Oaks which included Gull Nook (Ribblesdale Stakes), Park Express, Untold, Fleur Royale and Ivor's Image (Oaks d'Italia). Racing on much firmer ground she finished fourth of the eleven runners behind Untold, Park Express and Ivor's Image. On her final appearance Colorspin was matched against male opposition and older horses in the Irish Champion Stakes at Phoenix Park Racecourse on 7 September. She never looked likely to win and was outpaced in the straight, coming home eleventh of the thirteen runners, some sixteen lengths behind the winner Park Express. Assessment In 1985, the independent Timeform organisation gave Colorspin a rating of 117 p (the \\"p\\" indicating that she was expected to make more than usual improvement), making her seven pounds inferior to their best two-year-old filly Femme Elite. In the official International Classification she was rated twelve pounds behind the top-rated Bakharoff and nine pounds behind the leading filly Baiser Vole. In the following year Colorspin was rated 118 by Timeform, eleven pound behind their best three-year-old fillies Sonic Lady and Darara.

A Catalogue of the Music of Alfred Hill the so-called Maori Symphony, is the first symphony by Alfred Hill. Its first three movements were completed by 1898,Lam, Y. C. (2006, June). Analytical study of Alfred Hill‚Äôs String Quartet no. 2 in G minor (Thesis, Master of Arts). University of Otago but the last movement remained unfinished. This may have been the second symphony composed in the Antipodes (the first was George Marshall-Hall's C minor completed in Melbourne in December 1892).Stiles Music Publications The first two movements (and maybe the fourth, if it was reconstructed correctly) of this symphony are the only symphonic movements by Hill not to be arranged from his earlier chamber music. The Finale was reconstructed by Allan Stiles, and the whole symphony got its first performance in 2007. The approximate duration is 40 minutes.  History  = The unfinished composition = Hill could begin composing the first movement of the symphony in his Leipzig years (between 1887 and 1891). Originally it had no program. The first three movements are prefaced with some poems by Thomas Bracken related to MƒÅori, but they were not initially intended for this piece: Hill added them after the success of his cantata Hinemoa. According to Allan Stiles, there are no real MƒÅori musical elements in the symphony. The first two movements were prefaced with extracts from the poem The March of Rauparaha, the third with part of the poem Waipounamutu. These inscriptions led the symphony to bear the subtitle Maori in some sources. The unfinished symphony may have been intended for a Wellington orchestra Hill conducted in 1892-1896. There are several reasons to think so: only two horns are required as well as two hand-tuned timpani (rather than pedal tuned ones). There is a copyist's contrabass part of the first three movements at the Mitchell Library, dated 1898, which gives the terminus ante quem for them. The manuscripts of the first three movements are located at the National Library of Australia in Canberra. The draft score of the finale was nearly completed: it lacks only the timpani part and dynamics (music), some brass parts are incomplete. Allan Stiles proposes two reasons why this composition remained unfinished: the one being Hill's growing interest in theatrical music, the other being the unlikely prospect of a complete performance. = Performance history and the final completion = Two of the three completed movements have been performed on several occasions, with different titles. The first (Allegro con brio) was performed in Melbourne in 1913 as Te Rauparaha Symphonic Poem. The second (Adagio) was performed as Tangi in Sydney (1899), then in Wellington (1907 and 1909) and in London (Crystal Palace, 18 July 1911). It is unknown whether the Scherzo has ever been performed, but it definitely originates from an early version of Hill's String Quartet No. 1 written in Leipzig (this first scherzo was later substituted in the Quartet with another one and eventually made its way into String Quartet No. 4). The symphony was edited by Richard Divall without any finale at all. After years of research, Allan Stiles identified and reconstructed the unfinished movement. His edition of the complete work was premiered on 15 July 2007 by the Wellington Chamber Orchestra under Professor Donald Maurice.Wellington Chamber Orchestra official site For the Finale Stiles used the 1903 Inaugural march used for the opening of Her Majesty's Theatre in Sydney. It was then included in Hill's unperformed opera Don Quixote (as overture) and later used in his film music for Smithy (Pacific Flight). Stiles claims the Inaugural march was rescored from the unfinished symphony's last movement. To back this hypothesis he lists similarity of music paper types, key, orchestration, and handwriting. However, Rhoderick McNeill thinks that the verdict of its status within the symphony remains open, as it is quite different from all the finales of Hill's string quartets and symphonies.  Structure  The symphony is in four movements. :I. Adagio ma non troppo ‚Äî Allegro con brio (B-flat major) :II. Adagio molto espressivo (E-flat major) :III. Scherzo. Presto (F major) :IV. March. Maestoso (B-flat major) The first movement containing 559 bars and lasting about 18 minutes is the longest in all Hill's instrumental output. It is in a sonata form. The Adagio is in a simple ternary form with a funeral march in C minor as a central section. The third movement is an uncomplicated scherzo with a trio.

These muscles are found in 75% of flying insects and have convergently evolved 7-10 times. Unlike their synchronous counterparts that contract once per neural signal, mechanical oscillations trigger force production in asynchronous muscles. Typically, the rate of mechanical contraction is an order of magnitude greater than electrical signals. Although they achieve greater force output and higher efficiency at high frequencies, they have limited applications because of their dependence on mechanical stretch.  Structure  = Molecular = Molecular components of myofibrils. Muscle can only contract when actin binding sites are revealed for myosin heads to attach. Created by Servier Medical Art and used under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License. The exact molecular mechanisms used by asynchronous muscles are unknown, but it is believed that asynchronous muscles have no unique molecular structures as compared to their synchronous counterparts. A study investigating the asynchronous power muscles in bumblebees with X-ray diffraction videos showed that actin and myosin alone are sufficient for generating asynchronous behavior. This finding helps explain how asynchronous muscles independently evolved across insect taxa. More recent work using similar X-ray diffraction techniques in Lethocerus discovered that troponin bridges may play a critical role in stretch activation. As the muscle is stretched, these bridges move tropomyosin to reveal myosin-actin binding sites. The muscle can only produce force when these sites are activated. = Macroscopic = Several changes to asynchronous muscles' macroscopic structure provide it with high force production and efficiency at high contraction frequencies. A critical adaptation is that asynchronous muscles maintain a tonic level of calcium instead of cycling calcium between contractions. This is evident in their long twitch duration. This is due to relatively spare sarcoplasmic reticulum. Because of requirements for high force production, myofiber and myofibril diameters are increased and the large amount of ATP necessary leads to high mitochondria densities. In Cotinus mutabilis, asynchronous muscles are composed of 58.1% myofibril, 36.7% mitochondria, and 1.6% sarcoplasmic reticulum. In comparison, synchronous muscles in Schistocerca americana are composed of 65% myofibril, 23.5% mitochondria and 9.6% sarcoplasmic reticulum. Although synchronous muscle has a higher percentage of myofibril, the cross-sectional area of asynchronous myofibril is 3.7 ¬µm2 as opposed to 0.82 ¬µm2 in synchronous muscle for the previously described species.  Properties  = Asynchrony between electrical stimulation and muscle contraction = The defining characteristic of asynchronous muscles is that there is no direct relationship between neural activation and muscle contraction. Typically, the number of muscle contractions is an order of magnitude greater than the number of action potentials sent to the muscle. Instead of directly controlling force generation, neural signals maintain [Ca2+] above a threshold for stretch- activation to occur. For asynchronous muscles, neural inputs are typically thought of as an \\"on-off\\" switch while mechanical stimulus leads to individual muscle contractions. However, recent studies using genetically engineered Drosophila revealed correlations between [Ca2+] and force production. Further work has shown bilateral calcium asymmetries in Drosophila. These results indicate that there is some level of neural control beyond a simple \\"on\\" or \\"off\\" state. = Delayed stretch activation and delayed shortening deactivation = Left: stress produced by asynchronous muscle under a stretch- hold-release-hold experiment. Right: stress-strain plot showing positive work production. The work generated is equal to the area enclosed by the work loop. Adapted from Josephson et al. (2000). Delayed stretch activation and delayed shortening deactivation allow asynchronous muscles to generate positive work under cyclic oscillations. When the muscle shortens, force drops and continues dropping even when the muscle length remains constant. Similarly, when the muscle lengthens, force increases and continues increasing after the muscle length remains constant. Because of these delays, the work produced by the muscle during shortening is greater than the work absorbed during lengthening, therefore producing positive work. In contrast, synchronous muscles absorb work under similar conditions. Both types of muscles consume ATP to drive force production and produce work. = Long twitch duration = Long twitch duration is a functional consequence of the macroscopic properties of asynchronous muscle. Because asynchronous muscle can generate power without cycling calcium between contractions, the required rate of calcium regulation is significantly slower. In addition to the reduction in sarcoplasmic reticulum, relatively large myofibril diameters lead to increased diffusion times of Ca2+.Under isometric twitch experiments, asynchronous muscle in Cotinus mutabilis were found to have a twitch duration of 125 ms. In the same study, synchronous muscle in Schistocerca americana had a twitch duration of 40 ms. Therefore, asynchronous muscles respond slowly to neural stimulus. In the case of insect flight, electrical stimulation alone is too slow for muscle control. For Cotinus mutabilis, the twitch duration is ten times as long as a wingbeat period.  Functional significance  = Resonant properties = Asynchronous muscles produce work when they undergo mechanical oscillations provided there is sufficient Ca2+. This can be achieved in one of two ways. First, two antagonistic muscles can be configured with elastic structures such that the contraction of one muscle stretches the other, causing it to activate and vice versa. This configuration is found in the power muscles of flying insects. Second, a single asynchronous muscle can deform an elastic element which then stretches the muscle and causes the muscle to contract again. This setup is used by Drosophila to oscillate mechanosensory organs known as halteres. As long as neural stimulus turn the muscles \\"on,\\" both systems will continue to oscillate. These systems can be thought of as resonant systems, for which the oscillation frequency is dependent on the elasticity, damping, and force applied to the system. In a simplified case, this can be thought of as a linearly damped harmonic oscillator, for which the damped resonant frequency is \\\\omega = \\\\sqrt{\\\\bigg(\\\\frac{k}{m}\\\\bigg)(1 - \\\\zeta^2)}. The damping ratio, Œ∂ , is dependent on c, the damping coefficient, m, the mass of the system, and k, the stiffness of the system as shown \\\\zeta = \\\\frac{c}{2 \\\\sqrt{mk}}. = Power-control tradeoffs = Asynchronous muscles sacrifice neural control and flexibility in exchange for high force production and efficiency. Given the long twitch duration of asynchronous muscle, neural control is too slow to power flight. For instance, the asynchronous muscles in Cotinus mutabilis contract ten times faster than expected given their twitch duration. Because these muscles rely on stretch activation, they must be configured such that they can be stretched by an external force. Furthermore, they are only useful when evolutionary pressures select for a muscle that reactively contracts against an imposed stretch. For example, in grasping tasks, it would be detrimental for antagonist muscles to spontaneously contract. Despite these disadvantages, asynchronous muscles are beneficial for high frequency oscillations. They are more efficient than synchronous muscles because they do not require costly calcium regulation. This allows for changes in their macroscopic structure for increased force production.  Applications  leftthumb300x300pxAsynchronous muscles power flight in most insect species. a: Wings b: Wing joint c: Dorsoventral muscles power the upstroke d: Dorsolongitudinal muscles (DLM) power the downstroke. The DLMs are oriented out of the page. = Insect flight = Miniaturization of insects leads to high wingbeat frequencies with midges reaching wingbeat frequencies of 1000 Hz. Because of their high force production and efficiency, asynchronous muscles are used to power insect flight in 75% of species. These insects possess two pairs of antagonistic asynchronous muscles that produce the majority of the power required for flight. These muscles are oriented such that as one pair contracts, it deforms the thorax and stretches the other pair, causing the second pair to contract. The same thoracic deformations oscillate the wings. By utilizing the elastic thorax to store and return energy during wing deceleration and subsequent acceleration, Drosophila is able to reduce energetic costs by 10%. This leads to a highly-efficient resonant system. When wingbeat frequencies match the resonant frequency of the muscle-thorax system, flight is most efficient. In order to change wingbeat frequencies to avoid obstacles or generate more lift, insects use smaller \\"control\\" muscles such as the pleurosternal muscles to stiffen the thorax. From the equations in the Resonant properties section, it is clear that the natural frequency of the system increases with stiffness. Therefore, modulating the stiffness of the thorax leads to changes in wingbeat frequency. = Mammalian hearts = Although heart muscles are not strictly asynchronous, they exhibit delayed stretch activation properties. As cardiac muscle is lengthened, there is an instantaneous rise in force caused by elastic, spring- like elements in the muscle. After a time delay, the muscle generates a second rise in force, which is caused by delayed stretch activation as seen in purely asynchronous muscle. This property benefits heart function by maintaining papillary muscle tension during the entire systolic cycle well after the electrical wave has passed. Through stretch activation, the heart can rapidly adapt to changes in heart rates. = Bioinspired robotics = Because of challenges arising from miniaturization such as poor scaling of electric motors, researchers have turned towards insects to develop centimeter-scale flying robots. Although the actuators in the RoboBee are not asynchronous, they use elastic elements to transmit forces from its \\"muscles\\" (piezoelectric actuators) to flap the wings. Similar to flying insects, they exploit resonance to improve efficiency by 50%.

Early life Fakir Baykurt was born Tahir on 15 June 1929, son of Elif and Veli Baykurt, in Ak√ßak√∂y which is a district of Burdur, Turkey. His birth date is not known accurately however he pointed out that he was born in middle of June, 1929 by his mothers memoirs. His family gave him name of his uncle Tahir who died in battle. Tahir enrolled at Ak√ßak√∂y Primary School in 1936 and lost his father just two years later. After his father's death, Tahir moved to Burhaniye, Bursa by aid of his uncle Osman Erdoƒüu≈ü in purpose of earning money by textile works. During World War II, his uncle Osman joined Turkish army and that event helps Tahir to continue his education freely. 1942 was a year Tahir began to writing poems when he was deeply malaria ill. After graduation from primary school, he enrolled at a village institute in G√∂nen, Isparta. During his institute days he focused on poetry and had a chance to read many books. On village institutes, he said: \\"Village Institute was huge chance for me. I was not able to enter any high school after graduation from primary school, my family couldn't afford. Village institutes were attracting students in the villages who have own wish for high education like me.\\" In these years, Tahir read poems of Nazƒ±m Hikmet, a leftist poet and novelist who is under arrest at that time, he had to read most of these poems in privacy due to political pressure on communists in Turkey. Literary career His first published poem Fesleƒüen Kokulum (My Basil-Scented) took place in a local journal T√ºrke Doƒüru. In 1947, Tahir used Fakir Baykurt as pen name first time, his pen name Fakir is known more than his real name Tahir among Turkish literature society. One year later Fakir graduated from village institute and he was assigned to Kavacƒ±k Village, which is near by Fakir's native hometown, as teacher. During his career, he met poets and authors several times. In 1951 he married Muzaffer, he was appointed to Derek√∂y and his home was investigated under prosecution process. Two years later Fakir entered Turkish Literature Department of Gazi Faculty of Education. Fakir is judged next year due to some of his writings in Gayret journal. In 1955 he graduated from Gazi Faculty of Education, his first book √áilli (Freckled Face) was published. In 1957 he was conscripted, his daughter I≈üƒ±k was born, a year later, Fakir won Yunus Nadi Novel Award by his first published novel Yƒ±lanlarƒ±n √ñc√º (Revenge of the Snakes). However he and committee of the Yunus Nadi Award were prosecuted due to this decision. After this prosecution, Fakir began writing for Cumhuriyet which is a secular and republican Turkish daily newspaper. Fakir was unseated by virtue of his articles in Cumhuriyet, after removal of authoritarian Democrat Party by succeeded coup d'√©tat, Fakir had chance to get back on task; he was assigned to Education Inspector of Primary Schools in Ankara and his book Efkar Tepesi (Hill of Pensiveness) was published. Political struggles After disappearance of political oppression on leftists in Turkey by 1960 coup d'√©tat, Fakir's first novel Yƒ±lanlarƒ±n √ñc√º was made into a 1962 movie directed by Metin Erksan and adapted into a theatrical play. Although the film was banned at first due to its critical features, it was released again by influence of President Cemal G√ºrsel. His novels Onuncu K√∂y (Tenth Village), Karƒ±n Aƒürƒ±sƒ± (The Stomach Pain), Irazca'nƒ±n Dirliƒüi (Irazca's Peace) were published at this period. Baykurt had training about aesthetical act of writing and education skills in Indiana University Bloomington. In 1963, his son Tongu√ß was born, Baykurt returned to Turkey and he resumed inspectorship duty in Ankara. Just a year later Yƒ±lanlarƒ±n √ñc√º was translated into German and Russian whilst Irazca'nƒ±n Dirliƒüi was translated into Bulgarian. In 1965, Baykurt was one of members who established Teachers Union of Turkey; he was elected chairman of this union. Baykurt visited Bulgaria and Hungary under the title of chairman of the union. He was unseated from Education Inspector duty in consequence of his efforts in union. His novels Amerikan Sargƒ±sƒ± (American Wrap) and Kaplumbaƒüalar (Turtles) were published in 1967, it was the same year that his novel Onuncu K√∂y was translated into Russian. Baykurt was prosecuted and exiled to Fevzipa≈üa which is a small town in eastern Turkey due to his unionist activities and articles in some journals although his determinedness on resuming activities in union. In 1969 he was unseated but one year later he got back on task by state council decisions. At the same time his books Anadolu Garajƒ± (Anatolia Garage) and Tƒ±rpan (The Swath) were published. Baykurt won TRT literature award by his novels Sƒ±nƒ±rdaki √ñl√º and Tƒ±rpan. During military memorandum, Baykurt was arrested twice and judged in court- martial. In 1973 Baykurt was imposed a ban on leaving the country. His books On Binlerce Kaƒünƒ± (Tens of Thousands Tumbrels), Can Parasƒ±, K√∂yg√∂√ß√ºren (The Village Destroyer), Keklik (The Partridge) and ƒ∞√ßerdeki Oƒüul (The Boy in Prison) were published in these years. In 1975 Baykurt was acquitted from Teachers Union of Turkey case at military court.

Early life  May Adrales was born in Covington, Virginia to Filipino immigrant parents. Her mother was a nurse, her father was a general surgeon, and both moved from medical training and residencies in New York to rural Virginia to fill a need for medical professionals. When she was younger, she loved to run, and she still continues this hobby today. She received her Bachelor of Arts in English Literature and Modern Studies from University of Virginia, and her Master of Fine Arts in Directing from the Yale School of Drama. Career When asked what inspired her to go into directing, she said, \\"Be the change you wish to see in the world. I took that adage pretty seriously. I wanted to figure out how to make the world a more joyous, more democratic, and more beautiful place -‚Äì a world that embraces complexity, creativity and diversity on every level\\". She originally wanted to go into law, but eventually found theatre. Even then, though, she was faced with a challenge of access; when she first moved to New York, she had no formal training nor contacts in the business. Additionally, in her words, \\"For the most part there weren‚Äôt stories that reflected my experience or people on stage that looked like me. Theater felt impenetrable\\". Eventually, in part with the support of a community and a mentor, she became an award-winning professional director, teacher, and artist. Reception =Vietgone= In 2016, Adrales directed Vietgone, by Qui Nguyen, at the Manhattan Theatre Club. The show features two Vietnamese refugees who meet in America in 1975, during the fall of Saigon. The production was well-received, earning three Lucille Lortel Award nominations, as well as several rave reviews. The New Yorker mentioned \\"its resourceful director, May Adrales,\\" in talking about the \\"gleefully salacious quasi-musical\\". The Los Angeles Times said that the show was \\"directed with controlled spunk by May Adrales\\". Time Out New York, a city-culture promotion website, said, \\"May Adrales‚Äôs high- octane staging moves so swiftly and surely, you may not initially appreciate the buckets of stagecraft she and Nguyen throw at us scene after scene\\". =Chinglish= In early 2014, Adrales directed Chinglish, a comedy about cross-cultural communication (or lack thereof) at the Portland Center Stage. This too was well-received. The Oregon Artswatch says, \\"The show, directed by May Adrales, is as smooth as its revolving scene changes, capturing a brittle and deftly timed presentational comic edge in its performances and navigating the tricky shoals of its bilingual text (about a quarter of the dialogue is in Mandarin, with English supertitles) without an apparent hitch\\".

History The tower was built around 1200 for the local noble Pontresina family and originally was known by that name. The village first appeared in 1137 as ad Pontern Sarisinam. The Pontresina family was probably fairly wealthy and powerful in the early 13th century, but often quarreled with the Bishop of Chur. They are first mentioned in 1244 when they were stripped the office of chancery over the Upper Engadine by the bishop. They apparently later regained the office because in 1294 they pledged it to the Planta family. Their fortunes quickly declined and the last member of the family is mentioned in 1307, with the castle going to the Murell family. Pontresina Castle was abandoned by the 15th century. In 1550 Ulrich Campell records that the castle is a ruin. In the 18th or 19th century it started to be referred to as Spaniola. The tower was repaired and strengthened in 1994. Castle site Spaniola is located on a hill near the village of Pontresina. It is a five sided bergfried (a tower not designed for permanent habitation) that is still four stories tall. The unusual five sided shape may have been an attempt by the builder to protect the castle from rock slides or avalanches, the pointed side faces the mountain. The original high entrance was located on the second story of the south-west wall. The tower was crowned by with crenallations and probably had a pyramidal roof in the center. Wooden balconies or a platform surrounded the upper level. It was probably surrounded by a small ring wall which enclosed a space.

Gagnon founded the Cutivereni mission in Peru's Ene River valley to assist the indigenous Ash√°ninka people who were being forced out of their homes in the jungle by settlers. He would later become known for his work helping arm the Ash√°ninka and eventually helping some Ash√°ninka flee Cutivereni when it was facing attack from Shining Path guerrillas during the Internal conflict in Peru. He later wrote about his experiences during the conflict in the book Warriors in Eden.  Early life and priesthood  St. Joseph's Seraphic Seminary, Callicoon, New York Joseph Theodore Gagnon was born on October 7, 1929, to a M√©tis father and a French-Canadian mother. He grew up in New Hampshire and was raised Catholic. He completed his high school education and then studied at St. Joseph's Seraphic Seminary, a Franciscan minor seminary in Callicoon, New York. Gagnon's fascination with Peru and the Ash√°ninka began after World War II, when he heard a bishop give a talk about them. He then worked for three years in a shoe factory and restaurant in New Hampshire to save money to allow him to visit Lima. In 1948, he came to Peru, entered the Franciscan order, and took the name Mariano. Gagnon was ordained a priest in 1957, and spent three years working with those who spoke Cocama, an indigenous language of Peru. He said of the people that he served, \\"They are the most virtuous people I have ever met. They never lie and have great respect for personal property. Their language is very sharp. There is no word for 'maybe' in Campa.\\" He also observed that they did not chew coca leaves and were not prone to sharing food and drink, which had been a major cause of rampant tuberculosis. There was also a high infant mortality rate. By 1969, he had established two missions and began work on a third.  Cutivereni mission  Gagnon worked near the Ene River in the Peruvian Amazon to help protect individuals who were losing their land to settlers In 1969, he founded a mission to work with the Ash√°ninka due to deforestation caused by settlers. He maintained the Cutivereni (alternate spelling Cutivireni) mission of the Ene River parish in the Peruvian Amazon, southeast of Satipo. Cutivereni was a hub for 5,000 Ash√°ninkas who lived in the area. The mission, located at the confluence of three rivers, had 91 buildings and housed 700 people. The mission was equipped with a plaza, a chapel, a generator building, an infirmary, a bilingual school, workshops, and a landing strip. The Ash√°ninka hunted, and farmed manioc other foods. They also grew cocao, a cash-crop. The indigenous people lived on their traditional lands until the 1950s, when settlers began encroaching. Gagnon found them to be \\"free from pretension, ostentation or calculation. Obviously, these uncommon virtues in a modern society make them victim to many abuses.\\" Partly due to his efforts, the Cutivireni land was protected from settlement by others; it was the only land of the Ash√°ninka people to be preserved. Although taught modern technology and facilitated Spanish lessons with the Summer Linguistics Institute, a Protestant organization, for the indigenous people, he did not try to change aspects of their culture, like polygamy or women going topless. The Ashaninkas were pressured to begin growing coca as cocaine trafficking increased in Peru by the early 1980s. Gagnon said that he would leave the mission if the people entered the cocaine trade, and no one chose to change their way of life. As the trade grew in the area, though, Gagnon talked to a United States Drug Enforcement Administration agent and sent a letter to the Peruvian security police base commander in Mazamari in 1983. Gagnon was told, and heeded the advice of two drug traffickers, not make any further overtures about the cocaine trade.  Internal conflict in Peru  In 1980 the Communist Party of Peru, known as the Shining Path, launched an insurgency against the government of Peru. This conflict followed Maoist tactics of guerrilla warfare. In 1983, Gagnon met with members of the Peruvian government to let them know about the difficulties in Cutivireni. While he was meeting with authorities in Lima, members of the Shining Path burned down the mission and threatened that they would kill him if he came back in May 1984. The Franciscans who were working with the Ash√°ninka did not have a coordinated strategy to provide for their defense, but Gagnon was able to secure weapons from the Peruvian army, and approached the United States military for support as well. Gagnon began rebuilding the mission and it was complete in 1988. In June 1989 members of the Shining Path arrived at the mission and demanded supplies. Gagnon's mission paid a tax to them of writing supplies during this period. In November 1989, the Shining Path once again assaulted the mission and burned the buildings. while Gagnon was in the United States. Two mission leaders and two schoolteachers were killed by the guerillas, and a war broke out between the people at Cutivireni and the Shining Path fighters. Gagnon returned to Peru, staying in Satipo and attempting to visit on December 26. Warned not to land, he dropped Christmas presents and salt from the plane. There continued to be casualties on both sides. In April 1990, he arranged for several hundred Ash√°ninka to make a five-day trek from the central highlands into the mountains of Peru at Tzibokiroato. During this time period, he was recalled by his religious superiors to Lima, where they questioned his arming the Ash√°ninka, because of the view that the Catholic Church should not use violence. Gagnon responded that the Church had resorted to the use of violence in the past, and should not be hypocritical. In September 1990, the village that they had built of houses in the remote location was surrounded and attacked by guerillas of the Shining Path while Gagnon was in Lima strategizing with others on ways to protect the indigenous people from being killed, enslaved, or indoctrinated. The Ash√°ninka escaped, but the Shining Path captured their village. Gagnon arranged for 213 Ash√°ninka to be taken to a Dominican mission in Urubamba. He arranged 20 airlifts to transport the refugees approximately 150 miles to safety. On September 22, 1990, after the Ash√°ninka were safe with the Dominicans, Gagnon left the indigenous people and his mission.  Author  Gagnon documented his experiences with co-authors Marilyn and William Hoffer. He lived in Bowling Green, Virginia, outside of Richmond, when he wrote the book and into 1995. * * (translation) * (translation)  Later years  Gagnon celebrated his 50th year as a priest in 2007. He shared his time at the Mateo Pumacahua Friary in south Lima and in the jungle near Satipo by 2008. He served at San Ram√≥n, Peru, when he received an award on May 8, 2014 from the government of Peru, which he had been nominated for by Father Eduardo Arens. Anthony Wilson, OFM said, \\"Many referred to Mariano as a modern-day hero for his work during the time of terrorism in the Peruvian Amazon.\\" Gagnon celebrated his 60th year as a friar in 2011 and 60th year ordained in 2017. Gagnon died on April 28, 2017, at 87 years old.  In popular culture  * Gagnon was among the cast of Burden of Dreams, a documentary released in 1982.

He was Chris Evans' agent and has run several talent agencies. He was a Labour donor and Parliamentary candidate, but he left the party after a series of disputes with leader Jeremy Corbyn. Early life Foster is Jewish; his grandfather was in the Dachau concentration camp, but was released when he gave up his factories and he moved to Palestine. 21 of his relatives died in the Holocaust. Foster's father, Walter Foster (born Fast), was born in Vienna in 1923 and arrived in London as a refugee following Kristallnacht. Walter later ran the Anglo-Austrian Society until 1992 and died in December 2009. Foster's mother Rachel Ginsburg helped draft the Children Act 1948. They met at the London School of Economics and married in 1949. Foster has two brothers and a sister. Foster studied PPE at New College, Oxford. Career Foster became an agent in 1982. As co-chair of International Creative Management in London from 1986 to December 1997, Foster was agent for TV and radio presenter Chris Evans and actors Liz Hurley and Hugh Grant, among others. Foster then became managing director of Television at Evans' Ginger Media Group. Foster became CEO of Evans' Ginger TV in January 1998, then left suddenly in September 1998 (receiving ¬£1.1 million, reported by Broadcast as an acrimonious departure) to become a drama producer. Foster was recruited by Waheed Alli, the managing director of Carlton Productions (part of Carlton Communications), to become managing director of content in August 1999. He left Carlton in February 2001. After Evans left Virgin Radio (which Foster co- owned) in 2001, Evans founded a TV production company, UMTV with Foster and Chris Gillet. Foster also founded Artists Rights Group with Sue Latimer in May 2001, becoming the agent for Ross Kemp, Evans, and Evans' then wife Billie Piper. At ARG he was also the agent for Trinny and Susannah. Foster was No. 99 in The Guardian's media Top 100 in 2003 and No. 68 in 2011. All3Media bought ARG in March 2006 and Foster left in February 2008, buying out his part of ARG and founding his own talent agency MF Management. In May 2010, Foster merged his three-person business MF Management with PFD, the business of his friend, literary agent Caroline Michel, to form The Rights House, with Foster and Michel as the senior partners and Foster holding a controlling stake. PFD was headed by Matthew Freud, who had invested in MF Management. Among his clients at Rights House was Sacha Baron Cohen. In 2013, Foster sold his stakes in his companies The Rights House and PFD when he decided to stop being an agent. He also previously had a stake in production company Carnival Films. Charity In September 2012, Foster founded a charity, Creative Access, with Josie Dobrin to help ethnic minorities into internships, working with recruitment companies SEO London and New Deal of the Mind. It was initially funded by Foster and other private donors included Richard Desmond. The first intern worked on the film Kick Ass 2. It placed over 700 interns, but lost its government funding in December 2016. Foster also does work for the Wish Centre, a self-harm and violence charity for young people in Harrow and Merton. Politics Foster joined the Labour Party in 1974 and from 2010 to 2015 donated over ¬£400,000 to the party. He was selected in January 2014 to be the Labour candidate for Camborne and Redruth at the 2015 general election, on a platform of creating jobs in Cornwall. He donated over ¬£100,000 to his local party during the campaign. His election agent was Jude Robinson. He was endorsed by his celebrity clients Hugh Grant, Ross Kemp, and Alan Davies. After being selected, Foster tossed his phone across a table during the filming of Sunday Politics, hitting Conservative MP Sheryll Murray in the wrist; he apologised and said it was not deliberate. His Mebyon Kernow opponent Loveday Jenkin accused Foster of threatening her at a hustings, which he said was untrue. Foster increased the Labour vote, but the Conservative candidate won the seat by 7000 votes. After Jeremy Corbyn won the Labour leadership in 2015, Foster heckled him at a Labour Friends of Israel event that September for not saying \\"Israel\\" in his speech. In April 2016, Foster withdrew funding from the central Labour Party due to what he perceived to be an increase in antisemitism in the party. He sued in July 2016 to try to stop Corbyn being on the ballot in the 2016 leadership election after Labour's NEC ruled that as the incumbent Corbyn did not need to be nominated to be a candidate, but High Court Judge David Foskett ruled that Corbyn could stand; Corbyn called the case a \\"waste of time and resources\\". Foster was suspended from Labour in September 2016 after he called supporters of Corbyn \\"Sturm Abteilung (stormtroopers)\\" in an article in the Mail on Sunday. After he left the party, Foster said in The Sunday Times he would stand against Corbyn if Labour did poorly in the May local elections and Corbyn did not resign. He subsequently stood against Corbyn in the June 2017 general election in Islington North, with the slogan \\"Labour for the Common Good\\". He obtained 0.4% of the vote, while Corbyn was re-elected with a greatly increased majority and 73% of the vote. A few days after the election, Foster wrote that he had been wrong about Corbyn's leadership. Personal life Foster moved to Cornwall in around 2005 and lived in a second home in Port Navas worth over ¬£1 million. He has four daughters. Haaretz reported \\"He is known for his fiery temper and angry outbursts.\\" He has said when he was an agent he broke his finger by tapping on a table to make a point, and saw a psychiatrist, Steve Peters, to help with his temper.

The son of Herbert Henry Elvin, general secretary of the National Union of Clerks, and brother of Lionel Elvin, who became a prominent educationalist, George devoted his youth to political activism.\\"Obituary: Mr George Elvin\\", The Times, 16 February 1984 In 1930, he became the first secretary of the National Workers' Sports Association. This organisation, set up by the Labour Party and Trades Union Congress, was a rival to the communist-led British Workers' Sports Federation and principally organised international competition for workers' sports teams, including sending teams to the International Workers' Olympiads.Matthew Worley, Labour Inside the Gate, p.162 Through this, Elvin was a leading opponent of holding the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin. In 1934, Lionel suggested to George that he become involved in the Association of Cine-Technicians. This had been founded the previous year but was struggling; it had only 88 members, few of whom had paid subscriptions, and was in financial difficulties. Elvin was appointed as its general secretary and immediately established a union journal, and an employment exchange to help members find work. This enabled him to recruit many more members; within a year of his appointment, the union had more than 600 members and its finances were sound. On the outbreak of World War II, the British Government decided that film production should halt. Elvin successfully argued that it should continue in order to boost morale. After the war, he led in the union in campaigning for the establishment of the National Film School and the National Film Finance Corporation. The union expanded its remit, becoming the \\"Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians\\", and by 1969, membership was more than 16,000. Its prominence was such that, when the Federation of Entertainment Unions was established in 1968, Elvin was appointed as its first secretary.\\"Entertainment unions form confederation\\", The Guardian, 6 September 1968 Elvin was also active in the Labour Party.

Plot Supergirl fights Superman, who hallucinates that she is General Zod due to Rhea's silver Kryptonite. Supergirl knocks Superman unconscious and carries him to the Fortress of Solitude. She and a recovered Superman research the Daxamites. They return to National City and Supergirl challenges Rhea to single combat, a sacred Daxamite tradition. Superman affirms that Supergirl defeated him and is Earth's champion. M'gann telepathically wakens J'onn. Lillian acknowledges Lena is a better ally than Lex. They meet with Supergirl and Superman. Lena will adapt Lex's failed anti- Superman weapon to use against Daxamites; designed to seed the atmosphere with Kryptonite, it will instead spread lead. Lena regrets that Mon-El would have to leave Earth, but Supergirl authorizes the plan as a failsafe. Winn assists Lena, and Mon-El supports Supergirl's decision. Supergirl trains with Superman. She reflects that Rhea could ruin her happiness; Superman reveals that his love for Lois Lane motivates him in every fight. Supergirl and Rhea duel. Rhea dishonorably resumes the full-scale invasion; Mon-El, Superman, and J'onn fight the invaders, joined by M'Gann and sympathetic White Martians. Lillian tries to activate the perfected lead device, but Lena reveals Supergirl controls it remotely. Supergirl bloodies Rhea, who reveals she laced her blood with Kryptonite. Supergirl still overcomes Rhea, who orders the city's destruction. She explains that even if she dies, the invasion will never stop. Mon-El arrives; with his support, Supergirl activates Lena's device. Rhea dies and her forces flee Earth. Mon-El, strengthened by yellow sun exposure, has time for Supergirl to give him her mother's necklace before he leaves in a Kryptonian ship. They declare their love. He thanks her for her influence and vows to live up to her example. Alone in space, Mon-El's pod enters an anomaly. Supergirl's allies celebrate. Superman praises Supergirl's strength as superior to his and returns to Metropolis. M'gann has started a social movement on Mars, but can temporarily stay on Earth; she and J'onn kiss. Supergirl tells Alex that she is truly happy for her loved ones' romantic relationships. Alex proposes to Maggie, who smiles but doesn't answer. Kara confides in Cat about her relationship ending. Cat advises her that a woman's vulnerability is her greatest strength, and notes Kara's professional successes. An emergency prompts Kara's departure; Cat knows that Kara is Supergirl. A flashback from 35 years earlier reveals that as Krypton died, a sinister group of Kryptonians sent a baby (\\"it\\") to Earth to become its conqueror. Production The episode's title mirrors a statement from Republican U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell to characterize the actions of Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, which has since become a rallying cry for supporters of women's rights. Reception =Ratings= The episode attracted 452,000 viewers upon its British premiere, making it the 6th most watched programme on Sky One for the week. =Critical response= This episode received mixed reviews. Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave the episode a 5.9/10: \\"It's a real shame that two of the worst episodes of Supergirl's second season had to arrive at the very end. \\"Nevertheless, She Persisted\\" only managed to make use of a handful of its massive cast, and it left way too many plot threads and crucial character arcs dangling. Only the return of Superman and a fittingly tragic end to the Kara/Mon-El romance managed to salvage an otherwise poorly executed finale.\\" Caroline Siede of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B: \\"Unlike last week‚Äôs episode, ‚ÄúResist‚Äù, which wove together a whole bunch of the season‚Äôs ongoing storylines while maintaining a palpable sense of forward momentum, ‚ÄúNevertheless, She Persisted‚Äù is a tad clunkier. After resolving last week‚Äôs cliffhanger and defeating a mind- controlled Clark, Kara decides to take on Rhea in an ancient Daxamite single combat duel. But when Rhea goes back on her word, Kara has to activate a device that will fill the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere with lead, making it inhospitable to Daxamites, including Mon-El. The episode‚Äôs heart turns out to be the Kara/Mon-El relationship, although it takes about 2/3 of the episode to get there. But if the plot is a little thin, at least the action isn‚Äôt.\\" References Category:2017 American television episodes Category:Supergirl (TV series) episodes Category:Television episodes about alien invasion ","title":"Nevertheless, She Persisted (Supergirl)"},{"id":"53932465","text":"Albcontrol is a 100% joint stock Albanian company owned by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy (Albania) .

Nonyelu'), QC was born on 3 September 1914; eight months after Northern Nigeria and Southern Nigeria were amalgamated by Sir Fredrick Lugard. He was, the First Federal Director of Public Prosecutions (Attorney General) of Nigeria (1960‚Äì1964) and one of the pioneers of the Nigerian Bar Association . In 1961, G.C. was appointed a Queen's Counsel. As Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), he was responsible for instituting and conducting prosecutions or to decline to proceed further with a prosecution. It was his responsibility to ensure a fair trial according to the rule of law. Early life and education G.C. was born in Aba, Abia State. He was the first son of Josiah Ezidinma (a nurse) and Zipporah Nonyelu. G.C's father, Josiah, was the direct descendant of Ogbe Ukwu, the son of Ngene Ezeriam in Amawbia, Anambra State. As such, G.C's heritage was from Anambra. G.C went to St Michael's primary school in Aba where his strong and unique academic abilities paved the way for him to be enrolled in the famous Hope Waddell Training Institute Calabar. Subsequently, G.C. secured an admission into Igbobi College, Lagos and decided to pursue a career as Barrister. He felt this role was necessary for him in order for him to fulfill his ambition and pursue his dreams for Nigeria. In 1944, G.C. travelled to England alongside Chief Obafemi Awolowo and Chief Akintola Williams. While in England, G.C. studied law at the Honourable Society of Lincoln's Inn and the Inns of Court and on 26 January 1948, he was called to the Bar of England and Wales. In 1961, G.C. was appointed a Queen's Counsel. In 1964, Independent Nigeria stripped away the independence of the DPP and made it a department under the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, which were political offices. G.C. believed this not to be in the interest of the nation as separation of power was the hallmark of a free and fair democracy. He pre- empted this could lead to chaos, corruption and a breakdown of society. He resigned in protest when this change was implemented as he did not feel able to serve under the new terms. Political and Legal career G.C. set up a legal practice (Nwezidunma Chambers) in Port Harcourt upon his return to Nigeria from the United Kingdom. In 1952, he was invited by Chief Obafemi Awolowo, leader of the Action Group, to serve as Legal Adviser for his group. He served in this capacity in the historical conference on the Nigerian Constitution held at No 10 Carlton House Terrence London in 1953. The main objective of the conference as outlined by the Chair, Mr Oliver Lyttleton, was the question of Nigeria's self-government. After the 1953 conference in London and following several reforms, Nigeria was made independent on 1 October 1960 (four years after the initially proposed year of 1956). G.C. was then made the first Director of Public Prosecutions of the Federation of Nigeria. His role was mainly to institute and conduct prosecutions, assist in inquests and inquiries, to provide advice to investigators or to bring a matter to a close. The DPP was seen as the official whose aim was to ensure a fair trial and establish the truth. In 1964, G.C. resigned from the role of DPP as he felt that the role did not serve the purpose to which he originally agreed to. He felt that the change the government chose to introduce undermined the rule of law as it allowed for political interference in the administration of justice. The Nigerian Bar Journal 1980 reported that his resignation was in protest to the several politicians (including Chief Obafemi Awolowo) arrested on alleged treason. After his resignation, he tried to keep a low profile and focus on his career as Barrister. He died in 1972 barely two years after the end of the civil war. Nonyelu served on the Enugu Colliery (Iva Valley) massacre case alongside H.U Kaine, Rotimi Williams, H.O. Davies, Jaja Nwachukwu, M.O Ajegbo, G.C. Nkemena, C.D. Onyeama, G.C.M. Onyiuke, and M. Ogo Ibeziako. G.C's influence spanned beyond the Eastern region as he set up a sister Chamber in Lagos. Personal life Nonyelu married Emily (Emilia) Aguta, a nurse trained by the Christian Missionary Society (CMS). Emily was from Mbieri, Imo State, the granddaughter of Chief Abraham Aguta, the traditional ruler of Ubaku Mbieri in Ikeduru, Imo State. Nonyelu had five children, three girls and two boys. Philanthropy Nonyelu and his wife founded Iruka Clinic which catered to pre and post-natal care.

Part of Sunrise's Gundam Franchise, it was first serialized in Kodansha's Sh≈çnen magazine Comic BomBom from August 20, 1982 until December 17, 1986, compiling up to 15 Tankobon volumes. Plamo-Kyoshiro marks as the first spinoff in the Gundam franchise outside of the Universal Century timeline, and the first series to use the concept of battles using customized Gunpla. This idea has proven popular, and has been used later in other productions of the franchise. Plot The story of Plamo-Kyoshiro is about Shiro Kyoda, a young boy from Tamiya City and a student of the Bandai Elementary School. Shiro is an enthusiast of plastic model kits and \\"Plamo Simulation\\", a plastic model battle game. Shiro's dream is to become the representative of Japan in the World Simulation Tournament and be able to fight in the finals in the Battle of Hobbytopia. In addition to that, the manga contained original designs that would later inspire the Mobile Suit Variations and BB Senshi series. Production Plamo-Kyoshiro was written by Hisashi Yasui and illustrated by Koichi Yamato. In 1981 Kodansha had released the first issue of its magazine Comic Bom Bom. At that moment, the publisher was planning to launch a manga adaptation of the Mobile Suit Gundam movies, but the publisher was unable to get Sunrise's permission at the time. As an alternative plan, the publisher contacted Hisashi Yasui to create a new series, thus creating Plamo-Kyoshiro. Furthermore, the Plamo-Kyoshiro manga was created as a tool to publicize the Gundam plastic models that Bandai was launching at the time. Plastic models from other popular franchises also make appearances in Plamo-Kyoshiro, including those from Votoms, Dunbine, Dougram, Vifam, L-Gaim, Xabungle, Baldios, Star Wars, The Exorcist, Thunderbirds and Blue Thunder. More standard models such as those of airplanes, tanks and other vehicles make appearances. In addition, the characters appear customizing and creating their own original models of Vehicles and Robots. The manga also includes many references to real life companies and figures involved in the plastic model kit industry. Media =Manga= The original edition had 15 volumes and was in publication from August 20, 1982 until December 17, 1986 in Comic Bom Bom magazine by Kodansha. In 1989 a standalone volume was published entitled \\"Plamo-Kyoshiro-Musha Gundam Version\\". In 1990 a second edition of 11 volumes was launched. In 1999 a 6-volume deluxe edition was published. Between 2002 and 2004 a cheaper version of 13 volumes was published and in the year 2008 a paperback edition of 10 volumes was published. All Plamo-Kyoshiro publications, from the original 1982 until the last of 2008 have been published by Kodansha. The manga has also received several sequels and derivatives including: *Shin Plamo Kyoshiro *Hyper Senshi Gundam Boy *Plamo Wars *Gumpla Koshien *Gunpla Musashi *Gunpla Extreme The success of Plamo Kyoshiro marked a trend at the time of its publication and several publishers wanted to have a manga based on battles of plastic models. Coro Coro Comic launched a few similar-themed manga such as Plamo Tensai Esper Taro, 3D Koshien Plamo Daisaku, Majin Eiyuuden Wataru and Majin Kaihatsu Daisakusen. Hobby Boy Hitto-kun was another manga that was published in Terebi Magazine 2 (a sister magazine to Comic Bom Bom).

In a traditional solid-state transistor, a semiconductor channel exists between the source and the drain, and the current flows through the semiconductor. However, in a nanoscale vacuum-channel transistor, no material exists between the source and the drain, and therefore, the current flows through the vacuum. Theoretically, a vacuum-channel transistor is expected to operate faster than a traditional solid-state transistor, and have higher power output. Moreover, vacuum-channel transistors are expected to operate at higher temperature and radiation level than a traditional transistor making them suitable for space application. The development of vacuum-channel transistors is still at a very early research stage, and there are only limited study in recent literature such as vertical field-emitter vacuum-channel transistor, gate-insulated planar electrodes vacuum-channel transistor, vertical vacuum-channel transistor, and all-around gate vacuum-channel transistor.  History  The concept of using conventional field-emitted electron beam in a diode was first mentioned in a 1961 article by Kenneth Shoulders. However, due to the technological difficulty of fabricating a field-emitter electron source, such a diode was not implemented. As the field of microfabrication advanced, it became possible to fabricate field-emitted electron sources, thereby paving the way for vacuum-channel transistors. The first successful implementation was reported by Gary et. al. in 1986. However, early vacuum-channel transistors suffered from high gate threshold voltage and couldn't compete with solid-state transistors. More recent advances in microfabrication have allowed the vacuum- channel length between the source and the drain to be shrunk, thereby significantly reducing the gate threshold voltage below 0.5V, which is comparable to the gate threshold voltage of current solid-state transistors. As the shrinking of solid-state transistors is reaching its theoretical limit, vacuum-channel transistors may offer an alternative.  Simplified operation  A nanoscale vacuum-channel transistor is essentially a miniaturized version of a vacuum tube. It consists of a field-emitter electron source, a collector electrode, and a gate electrode. The electron source and the collector electrodes are separated by a small distance, usually of the order of several nanometers. When a voltage is applied across the source and the collector electrode, due to field-emission, electrons are emitted from the source electrode, travel through the gap and are collected by the collector electrode. A gate electrode is used to control the current flow through the vacuum-channel. Despite the name, vacuum-channel transistors do not need to be evacuated. The gap traversed by the electrons is so small that collisions with molecules of gas at atmospheric pressure are infrequent enough not to matter.  Advantages  The nanoscale vacuum-channel transistors have several benefits over traditional solid-state transistors such as high speed, high output power, and operation at high temperature and immunity to strong radiations. The advantages of a vacuum-channel transistor over a solid-state transistor are discussed in detail below: = High speed = In a solid-state transistor, the electrons collide with the semiconductor lattice and suffer from scattering which slows down the speed of the electrons. In fact, in silicon, the velocity of electrons is limited to 1.4√ó107 cm/s. However, in vacuum electrons do not suffer from scattering and can reach a velocity of up to 3√ó1010 cm/s. Therefore, a vacuum-channel transistor can operate at a faster speed than a silicon solid-state transistor. = Operation at high temperature = The band-gap of silicon is 1.11eV, and the thermal energy of electrons should remain lower than this value for silicon to retain its semiconductor properties. This places a limit on the operating temperature of silicon transistors. However, no such limitation exists in vacuum. Therefore, a vacuum-channel transistor can operate at a much higher temperature, only limited by the melting temperature of the materials used for its fabrication. The vacuum-transistor can be used in applications where a tolerance to high temperature is required. = Immunity to radiation = The radiation can ionize the atoms in a solid-state transistor. These ionized atoms and corresponding electrons can interfere with the electron transport between the source and collector. However, no ionization occur in the vacuum-channel transistors. Therefore, a vacuum-channel transistor can be used in a high radiation environment such as outer space or inside a nuclear reactor.  Disadvantage  The performance of a vacuum-channel transistor depends upon the field emission of electrons from the source electrode. However, due to the high electric field, the source electrodes degrades over time, thereby decreasing the emission current. Due to the degradation of electrons source electrode, vacuum-channel transistors suffer from poor reliability.

History The Planta Tower was the home castle of the Planta family, a widely spread and locally important lower nobility family in Graub√ºnden. In 1137 and 1139 the Bishop of Chur inherited several estates in the Upper Engadin, which he combined with the village of Zuoz to form the herrschaft of Zuoz. At some point in 12th or early 13th century he granted the herrschaft as a fief to the Planta family. In 1244 Andreas zu Zuoz was first mentioned, when he was granted the chancery title, which was stripped from the Pontresina family, by the bishop. The castle tower was also built in the 13th century, either for Andreas or by the bishop. In 1294 the Planta family received the chancery title again and thereby became one of the most powerful families in the Upper Engadine. Zuoz became the center of their power and a number of other towers and mansions were built in the town over the following centuries. They built castles throughout the region and a number of cadet branches were founded, with major branches in Zuoz, Wildenberg, Chur, Susch and Samedan. During the Swabian War of 1499, an imperial army under Count Hans von Sonnenberg invaded the Engadine valley. To escape the invaders, the citizens of Zuoz burned their town and the Planta Tower and fled into the mountains. Around this time, the Planta family either sold or abandoned the castle and by the mid 16th century it was owned by the community. In 1555 it was repaired and integrated into the newly built town hall. It was topped with a new gable roof and was at times used as a prison for the community. From 1901 until 1903 the tower was completely rebuilt under the direction of the architect Karl Koller. He raised the tower with an additional two stories and enlarged the windows. It was topped with crenallations and a tented roof. The north facade was decorated with the coats of arms of the Three Leagues. Since the renovation, the tower has housed the archives of the Oberengadin Kreis and provided meeting space. Castle site The walls of the tower still show some of the late-Gothic sgraffito decoration. The tower walls are about long and up to thick. Until 1903 it was only three stories tall, the upper two stories were added at that time.

The second Anglican bishop of Christchurch, Churchill Julius, wanted to see a community of nuns established in Christchurch. Edith Mellish from London was chosen and she arrived in Christchurch in August 1893. She founded the Community of the Sisters of Bethany, and in 1895, the sisters moved to Barbadoes Street. Originally, three buildings were erected on the corner of Barbadoes and St Asaph Streets. The first two were known as Deaconess House, with the first of these a simple one-storey designed by Benjamin Mountfort; he was one of New Zealand's most eminent architects and gave Christchurch a unique architectural identity. The second building was added in 1900, running perpendicular to the first building at two storeys high. This second building was designed by Cyril Mountfort, the son of Benjamin Mountfort, and contained the chapel. The third building, fronting Barbadoes Street, was designed by John Goddard Collins of Armson, Collins and Harman and built in 1911‚Äì12. It was a prominent two-storey brick building, hiding the original buildings behind it. In 1912, the community was renamed to avoid confusion with another community, and they were from then known as the Community of the Sacred Name. The brick building was damaged in the 2011 Christchurch earthquake and later demolished. The sisters sold the remaining timber buildings to a charity called 'Home and Family'.

The Subdivision is broken up into five sections, all in Nashville, Tennessee. Sections =Northern part= The northern part of the Terminal is in Madison, Tennessee, at milepost 000/0BA 174 on the southern end of the Ex-L&N; Mainline Subdivision at Monfort. Disptach for the Mainline Sub is known as \\"LD\\" which is part of the Cincinnati Division. From here in Madison begins the double track that stays for another 22 miles south to Brentwood, Tennessee. At milepost 000/0BA/00H 176.6, the famous Johnny Cash \\"Amqui\\" location where the Ex-L&N; Evansville, Indiana line, the Henderson Subdivision meets with the Terminal. Dispatch for the Henderson Sub is known as \\"SA\\" and operates on AAR58. =Crossings= There are two crossings near each other, Williams Ave and Nesbitt Lane at Amqui. From here the Terminal goes south about 2 miles to the Nashville National Cemetery to the first major location, known as Ekin, 000179, where there is a cross over track from number 1 to number 2 track (left to right track). There is also the first EDD (Defect Detector) at 000179.1. Few more miles southward, the next major location appears. At 000181.0, Maplewood is a major location for the Terminal. From here the regular Terminal goes south to swap crews at Kayne Ave, and the right side, Radnor Cutoff, detours the city and gives yard departures and arrivals direct access to and from Radnor yard to cities like Louisville and Chicago. =Cutoff= The Cutoff runs from Maplewood to Shelby Park double track. From Shelby the track converges into one to pass the historic Shelby bridge, then it opens back to double track. From there, the cutoff hits the Intermediates at 0BA187.0 known as Chicken Pike. The Radnor Cutoff carries the L&N; mainline classification of \\"0BA\\" but meets the main at the same milepost from the Terminal. At Chicken Pike, trains are staged to await arrival to Radnor yard. Once they get clearance, speed is decreased to 15, and at 0BA188.1 the EDD (Defect Detector) sounds for departures and arrivals. This location is known as North Radnor. The right track diverging from the #2 is known as A-1, it is for departure trains to Chattanooga and Atlanta. The left track which goes west from the #1 is known as A-2, and serves as a departure track to Memphis, and if the cutoff is out of service, all northbound departures. The interesting piece of Maplewood is the crossovers that are there to move trains from the Cutoff to the Main. Both lines remain double track for a while. =Main= The main runs south for 2 more miles until the Intermediate signals at 000183.0. Commonly trains will stop before Delmas Ave when Kayne Ave is at capacity and await dispatch permission before moving south. From here, the main continues south until the CR Cumberland River Swingbridge, where the main converges into a single track shortly to cross the bridge. At this point, trains had been running at track speed of around 40. From the drawbridge into town, speed is reduced to around 10. After the bridge is passed, the main returns to double track in downtown. On the #1 track about a half a mile south, another connecting track is present. This is the Wye track that connects the main with the Bruceton side, while rarely used for mainline trains, locals and river jobs use it. The location is known as 8th Avenue or 8th Avenue Wye. =Central Nashville= The main then runs down to Kayne Ave, the central hotbed of all Nashville through traffic. The Memphis, Tennessee Ex-L&N; Bruceton Subdivision meets with the Terminal. The Bruceton Sub begins at Church Street at 00N0.0. The line then runs single track until 00N0.7 \\"11th Avenue\\" where it turns into double track and also meets the aforementioned, Wye track. The Bruceton line then goes southwest a while to the next signals, at \\"Shops\\". Now speed has been increased. The line is still double track until \\"Sellars\\", where speed is increased to 40 and jurisdiction transferred to the SD Dispatcher. For a short time, 4 main tracks are present and an additional fifth track for switchers and yard movements. The tracks from left to right in Kayne Ave are as follows: 100, 99, 98, 12, 3. The Kayne Ave yard is also here in this area, which houses some freight and some switcher engines. The tracks to the old shed are covered and removed. The Union Station is not an active station, but a historic hotel. Crew change usually occurs at the \\"walkway\\" which is under the Demombreun St bridge by the Kayne Ave Tower. This is also where the Ex-NC&StL; Chattanooga Subdivision begins. Then tracks run south to Fogg St/South End where things get complicated. At milepost 000/0BA/00J187 the 98 track merges into the 12 track, making for 3 tracks now. =Crossover= There is a crossover from 99 to 12, also a crossover from 12 to 3. About 2/10ths of a mile down the 99 merges into the 12 track reducing the tracks back to the regular double. About 4/10ths of a mile down the line from Fogg St, 000187.4, Oak St, is a crossover track from #2 to #1 (the track names are no longer 3 and 12, but are back to regular names). When trains use this crossover northbound, such as Memphis bound trains from the A-2 line, they refer to it as \\"Long Lead\\". And now, the Terminal splits into two parts. The right side turns into a single track shortly, and will become the Chattanooga Subdivision, and the left side runs south to Brentwood. The right track runs single shortly until double track for a while. =J-Line= This begins part of the Chattanooga Sub or J-Line. The #2 meets with the A-2 connection track at 00J2.2 known as A-2. Speed is now increased to 40. Commonly northbounds will stage at 4th Ave on the #1 to await clearance. Now about a mile down the #1 meets the A-1 connection line. At 00J3.6 known as A-1. Further down the double track ends at Glencliff (00J4.9). Now it runs single for three miles until it hits Danley, which has the D Line connection track, which is an arrival track for incoming Radnor trains from the J Line. At Danley, the Terminal ends but the same dispatcher handles traffic, \\"SC\\". At Oak Street, our main terminal line goes south two miles to 000189.0 known as Criaghead or Vine Hill. There is a crossover here from #1 to #2 track. And there is also a connection/delivery track to the Nashville and Eastern Railroad which connects the Tennessee Central Railroad Museum to a major railroad. Trains sometimes stop on the #2 before Craighead if they are waiting to enter Radnor yard. Sometimes trains wait on the #1 at the Berry Road crossing if they await arrival to Kayne Ave. At this point, speed has been increased to 30 from 10. =Radnor Yard= Moving south, the line hits Radnor Yard at 000192. The #2 track meets the E-Line arrival track which most Memphis trains and locals use. The B-Line which meets the #1 track is used for departures out of the C yard and local jobs. At Mayton, 000192.3, the B line meets the #1 track, and there is a crossover track from #2 to #1. Speed is now at 40. 2 miles south, at 000194.0, South Radnor, the next intersection is present. This is where the Radnor A yard meets the main. There is a single departure/arrival track that meets the #2 track along with a crossover from #1 to #2 track. Commonly, the #2 track south of the signals is used to halt trains. =TVA= This location is known as TVA, because of the power station that is adjacent. From here the Terminal runs about 2.5 miles south until we hit the southern tip. The tracks converge onto one single main, at 000/0BA196.6 known as Brentwood. Speed is increased to 50 and jurisdiction to the S.E. dispatcher. The right track is the main, S&NA; North, while the left track is the Nashville Subdivision which runs to Columbia and exchanges freight with the TSRR. The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is one of the busiest locations on the CSX network, and one of the most important.http://www.multimodalways.org/docs/railroads/companies/CSX/CSX%20ETTs/CSX%20Nashville%20Div%20ETT%20%233%201-1-2005.pdf CSX Nashville Division Timetable See also * List of CSX Transportation lines References Category:CSX Transportation lines Category:Rail infrastructure in Tennessee Category:Rail transportation in Tennessee Category:Transportation in Nashville, Tennessee ","title":"Nashville Terminal Subdivision"},{"id":"53932937","text":"C.S.H.L (Centre for the Study of Human Learning) was established as a Post- Graduate Research Centre. Originally this was within the newly created Psychology Department of Brunel University.(1962). Within C.S.H.L. both research staff and post graduate students are enabled to progressively investigate the nature of human learning. It has gradually become evident that once the shackles of most forms of existing education are loosened, people {from primary school to post graduate work; and most other forms of instruction} can explore how each and every one of them can be enabled to learn how to thoroughly understand in personal terms much of what they need to know when and how they need to know it. And to do this in clearer and more applicable terms than their education seems to have allowed them to achieve. Whilst doing this, Sheila Harri-Augstein and Laurie Thomas invented, and indeed created, {and during the period 1962 up until the present day have gradually continued to improve both the concept and the practical reality of Self-Organised-Learning (S-O-L)}.  C.S.H.L's Purpose  The Centre's original goal was to enable students to learn better and more efficiently. This was started as the senate of Brunel asked Prof. Laurie Thomas to looking into how students 'learn-to-learn'. After some research into this and various other results, professor Thomas formed C.S.H.L (while inside the Psychology Department at the time) to further research into newer methods after noting the results of the initial research and deciding this needed more exploration.  Self-Organised Learning (S-O-L)   Psychological Research Methods   Historical Footnotes  # (1965) Founded inside the Psychology Department of Brunel College of Advanced Technology (Now Brunel University after 1966). # (1967) Left Psychology Department to become its own unit. # (2000) C.S.H.L leaves Brunel University to become its own independent Non-Profit Organisation.  Why C.S.H.L was established  Whilst Professor Laurie F. ThomasThomas, Laurie L. Thomas @ amazon.co.uk Author Page was still the Senior Lecturer in the Production Engineering department at Brunel College of Advanced Technology, the Senate asked him to chair a group which would advise on the idea of Learning-to-Learn together with Senior Lecturers from each of the mainstream departments. They interviewed various people and discussed and argued at length. Eventually it was decided that the committee should submit a report to the Senate. However, it had sown a seed into Professor Thomas' mind which after a year visit to the U.S (1962‚Äì63) in looking at new research in 'Learning' and time spent with Professor Carl Rodgers, Prof. Thomas then returned to Brunel and saw the launching of the Psychology department into Brunel which by then had now become a university. Six years later, with a variety of research projects underway, university politics made it necessary to create 'The Centre for the Study of Human Learning' to keep this research going.  Academic interest in CSHL and S-O-L  Warwick University has a Personal Development course which has Self-Organised Learning together with C.S.H.L. as a Resource for helping with the course and personal development.

Born in Aberdare, Williams attended the Parc School until he was fourteen, when he went to work at the Nantmelyn Colliery with his father. He joined the British Army at the outbreak of World War II and served in the Royal Horse Artillery and then the Royal Armoured Corps. He remained with the army until 1947, when the nationalisation of the coal mining industry led him to hope for improved conditions in the mines.\\"Williams, Emlyn\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography On returning to Wales, Williams again worked at Nantmelyn and became active in the South Wales Area of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). He was elected as chairman of its Bwllfa lodge; he later moved to Mardy Colliery and again served as chair of the local lodge. From 1957, he worked full-time for the NUM as an agent for the Rhondda, Cynon and Merthyr Tydfil area,Tony Heath, \\"Obituary: Emlyn Williams\\", The Independent, 19 July 1995 and by his retirement, he was the NUM's longest-serving employee. Williams was elected to the executive of the South Wales area in 1955, then as vice- president in 1966, and president in 1973 - the first candidate for president to be elected unopposed since Mabon in 1898. His time as president was marked by a series of strikes: the national strike of 1974, then a South Wales strike against pit closures in 1981. The 1981 strike succeeded in preventing immediate closures, but six of the seven pits closed within three years, regardless. When a national strike was declared in 1984, the majority of NUM members in South Wales voted against striking. Williams accepted this result, but the strike nevertheless rapidly took hold, and within a week, almost all miners in the region were on strike; 93% of them remained on strike until its end, in March 1985. Williams retired in 1986 to his home in Cwmbach, and died of pneumoconiosis in 1995.

Chamberlin Springs is a former recreational site outside of Beloit, Wisconsin, United States, that is now property of Beloit College. Started by Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin, a graduate of Beloit College in 1866, and his brother, John Chamberlin. Chamberlin Springs was originally a spring water business run by the Iodo-Magnesian Spring Company. Water from the spring was bottled up and sold for $7.00 \\"per barrel of 40 gallon, including package.\\"‚ÄúIodo-Magnesian Springs, Beloit, - Wisconsin,‚Äù ca 1876, Archives of Beloit Historical Society, Beloit, Wisconsin. The water from Chamberlin Springs was said to have healing properties, and was endorsed by several prominent community members from Beloit, including Beloit College's first President Aaron Lucius Chapin. The Iodo-Magnesian Springs, as they were originally called, attracted people from all across the Midwest, not just Beloit or Wisconsin as a whole. Chamberlin Springs is now a property of Beloit College and is used by students for geological, anthropological, and ecological research.  Historical background  = Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin = Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin, or T.C. as he liked to be known, was a geologist, entrepreneur, and occasional administrator. Chamberlin moved near Beloit, Wisconsin at a young age and his parents settled the 160 acres where the site lies today. While his brother John stayed and worked on the family farm, T.C. went to school at Beloit College. In 1875, the brothers began to market the site as a water source, but it quickly became a regional sensation with bottles being distributed and sold throughout the Midwest. In the meantime, T.C. worked as a high school principal, Beloit College professor, and accomplished geologist. He even worked for two of Beloit's largest manufacturing companies, serving as the Director of the Rock River Paper Company and the Vice President of Merrill and Houston Iron Works. After his death in 1928, the property was passed down to T.C.'s son, Rollin Chamberlin. For more information, see T.C. Chamberlin. = Iodo-Magnesian Spring Company = During its years of operation, Chamberlin Springs was managed by the Iodo-Magnesian Spring Company. The company managed to draw regional attention to the springs by marketing the curative properties of the water. According to an 1870s brochure put out by the group, the iodine and bromine contents, lack of organic material, and minerals such as lime gave the water remarkable purity. These qualities, they claimed, gave the water healing properties for a wide variety of health issues such as diabetes, liver ailments, rheumatism, and kidney disease. Development around the springs included a large gazebo, stairs, and landscaping, which enticed visitors from as far Milwaukee, Chicago, and St. Louis to visit the springs and stay in nearby Beloit. For those unable to reach the springs, the Iodo-Magnesian Company ran a business which distributed and sold the water by the bottle, keg, and even barrel. = Popularity = Picnics and other social events would have taken place in this area just above the springs. At the peak of its of fame, the site could garner quite the gathering on the weekends. Drinking from the waters was a social event and guests hosted often large picnics in the grassy clearing just above the springs. In fact, the old road leading to the springs suffered from heavy erosion due to the heavy traffic the springs brought, prompting city officials to consider building a trolley line to the area. Guests from far away would sometimes even stay in the Chamberlin family home nearby.  Beloit College ownership  A picture of the actual springs on site. The lightly colored, sandy area is where the water escapes from the ground. In 1946, the property was gifted to Beloit College by T.C. Chamberlin's son, Rollin Chamberlin. Geology Professor Monta Wing, who arrived at Beloit College in 1923 after working at the University of Chicago, was a primary factor in convincing Rollin to donate the property to the college; Wing took several trips down to Chicago to speak with the Chamberlin family in an attempt to complete this goal. Eventually, in 1946, he did, and for a long period of time, the property was left to become overgrown. Once acquired by the college, the site fulfilled its intended role as a multipurpose bird sanctuary, tree preserve, geology and biology field and research area, and even recreation area until 2000, when the area became overgrown and was rendered unusable. Since the summer of 2012 however, an ongoing restoration project has cleared the immediate area around the spring of invasive overgrowth, removed vegetation to establish a trail and small parking lot, and even erected a locally sourced limestone pillar gate to mark the entrance of the property. Today, the site continues to be used for field research by the departments of geology and biology.  Scientific work  Some biological and geological has been done on Chamberlin Springs. A chemical analysis by the Columbia College Laboratory of the School of Mines was done back in the 1800s at the request of the Chamberlin brothers and placed in a brochure about the \\"Iodo-Magnesian Springs\\", advertising its \\"grains [of different chemicals] in one gallon.\\" 12 different chemicals are identified in the water, and then a few \\"points of excellence\\" are identified regarding them. More recently in 1992, a different chemical analysis was done on the springs in order to determine the effects of springs on a stream system. This analysis focuses on how the actual springs influence the creek that they are a part of, as well as how the different rock styles from the Rock River Basin area affect the stream. Additionally, students attending Beloit College also continue to perform research about various topics on site, including hydrology and sustainability.  Archaeological work  A piece of manufactured wood discovered at the Chamberlin Springs site, 2017.As of May 2017, no archaeological work has been done on the Chamberlin Springs site. Possible archaeological techniques for examining the site include dendrochronology, Ground Penetrating Radar, Geographic Information Systems Analysis (GIS), and shovel excavations.

He is the founder and creative director of Brandon Maxwell, the luxury women‚Äôs ready-to-wear label.  Early life and education  Maxwell was born in Longview, Texas. His grandmother worked at a boutique in Longview, where he often spent his time. Growing up, Maxwell would put together outfits and photograph his friends wearing them. For High School, he attended Trinity School of Texas in Longview. In 2002, he moved to New York City to study painting at Marymount Manhattan College before graduating from St. Edward's University in Austin, Texas. Maxwell graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in photocommunications. After graduating, Maxwell returned to New York City to begin working.  Career  Prior to launching his eponymous womenswear label, Maxwell entered the fashion industry as a stylist. He began assisting Deborah Afshani in 2009, followed by Nicola Formichetti in 2010, where he was introduced to Lady Gaga, as Nicola was her stylist at the time. In 2012, Maxwell took on the role of Lady Gaga‚Äôs fashion director. Maxwell has styled for magazines such as Harper‚Äôs Bazaar, ELLE, V, Teen Vogue, and Porter. He has done ad campaigns for Barneys New York and Uniqlo. He was cited by The Hollywood Reporter as one of the top 25 stylists of 2015. Maxwell has collaborated with photographers such as Mario Testino, Inez & Vinoodh, Paola Kudacki, Giampaolo Sgura, Terry Richardson, and Steven Klein. In 2015, Maxwell d√©buted his women's ready-to-wear label, Brandon Maxwell, in New York at Mr. Chow. The brand was born out of the desire to make women feel beautiful, sophisticated, and powerful by creating timeless garments that are impeccably tailored. With a focus on craftsmanship, the entire collection is designed in New York City. Brandon‚Äôs integrity is present throughout the process; he crafts his garments by draping, rather than sketching, to ensure an ideal fit. Inspiration is drawn from the women whom Brandon surrounds himself with, which is evident in the sharp tailoring and the sculptural details. While attending St. Edward's University, Maxwell met friend and collaborator, Jessy Price. Together, Brandon and Jessy photographed and directed their first commercial short film together for the Brandon Maxwell Fall/Winter 2016 campaign. The success of this project lead them to directing Apple Music‚Äôs commercial for Lady Gaga‚Äôs song ‚ÄúA-Yo‚Äù from her 2016 album, Joanne. They have continued to direct campaigns for Brandon's eponymous label that focus on highlighting the featured talent. Maxwell revealed his spring 2019 collection, inspired by his fascination with cowboy culture and picturesque landscapes of the American Southwest. Maxwell generated the highest earned media value during New York Fashion Week the week following his show, ahead of Ralph Lauren and Tom Ford. Brandon Maxwell released his Fall/Winter 2019 Collection, returning to a fundamental palette of black after a splash of colors in the last collection, the Fall Winter 2019 runway show was held in an intimate and minimalist room at the Pennsylvania Hotel, so that the clothes would be the central focus. The collection is primarily in black and white with accents of apple green and bright rose to complement. The runway show began with a number of day wear pieces and then transitioned into evening wear, finishing in a dramatic fashion with a simple, yet elegant, billowing silk ball gown. Brandon Maxwell dressed Lady Gaga for the 2019 MET Gala.

The band's biggest hits include Just a Friend and True Love (That's a Wonder) in The Netherlands. Biography =1961-1974; success years= Vermeulen formed the band in 1961 as Sandy Coast Skiffle Group; his bass-playing brother Jan (1945-1999) joined and on his insistence they became Sandy Coast Rockers. The name was eventually abbreviated to Sandy Coast. They performed at community-centers and talent- contests; in 1965 they won a record-contract at Negram and released their debut-single Being in love. Their fourth single, a 1966 cover-version of Vera Lynn's We'll Meet Again (completely based on vocals and harmonies and instruments arrangement on The Byrds version from 1965) gave them their first taste of chart-success. I see your face again from their debut-album And their name is... broke the top 20 in the spring of 1968, and Sandy Coast soon traded beat for psychedelic rock. Capital punishment, recorded when Vermeulen suffered a cold, became another top 20-hit early 1969. The same year Sandy Coast signed to Page One; they recorded three singles plus their third album Shipwreck which failed to be as successful as its predecessor From the workshop. The label folded after a row between Larry Page and Dick James; the contract was still valid, and Sandy Coast were unable to put out new material for two years. In 1971 they signed to Polydor and released True Love (That's a Wonder) and Just a Friend. During this period the band were a five-piece completed by pianist Ron Westerbeek, longtime drummer Onno Bevoort and former Livin' Blues bass-player Henk Smitskamp (Jan Vermeulen temporarily switched to rhythm-guitar); the latter soon departed to join Shocking Blue. Chart-success continued with Just two little creatures and Summertrain in 1972, and Blackboard jungle lady in 1973 album. It was to be their final hit for the next couple of years as Sandy Coast disbanded in 1974. =1975-1979; solo projects= Bevoort and Westerbeek formed the band Water; Vermeulen and his brother continued in Rainbow Train for the remainder of the decade. He collaborated with alumnus Anita Meyer on her 1976 debut solo-single The Alternative Way which became a number one hit on the Dutch Top 40 chart. Vermeulen continued writing and producing for other artists. =1980-1990; reunions= Sandy Coast reformed on June 13, 1980 for the Haagse Beatnach, a sixties-revival-show featuring bands from The Hague and surrounding places. They performed a new song, The eyes of Jenny, which put them back in the charts in 1981. An album, Terreno, followed with including a reggae-flavoured version of Capital Punishment. Other hits were also rerecorded for 1988's Rendez-vous; the band occasionally performed at golden oldie shows minus Bevoort. =1994-present; twilight years of Hans Vermeulen and tributes= Vermeulen's triumphs as a producer and songwriter continued till the early 1990s. He moved to Thailand to make a fresh start on the back of 'The eyes of Jenny; he suddenly died in November 2017. February 2018 saw the release of Subject of my thoughts, a cd-box containing all albums by Sandy Coast and Rainbow Train plus non-album-tracks and Vermeulen's solo-efforts.

Once the dictatorship was overturned the NGO turned their focus to uniting organizations which pursue a broad spectrum of issues pertaining to women's rights and development. History Pro- Emancipation Movement of Chilean Women or MEMCh was created on 28 May 1935 by a group of mostly working class women, many of whom were members of or sympathizers with the Chilean Communist Party; however, their goal was to have broad membership representing all aspects of the nation. It was the first women's group formed in Chile with specific political goals and an organizational strategy to become a national organization, rather than a local club. The journal, ' () was created by the organization as a means of publishing their views on feminist issues. Its leadership was composed of some of Chile's pioneering feminists and include Elena Caffarena, Graciela Mandujano, Olga Poblete, and Marta Vergara, among others. Its first General Secretary and founder was Caffrena, who served in that capacity from 1935 to 1941. The organization was considered radical for its era, in that the women wanted full emancipation of their economic, civic and political spheres, recognizing that to attain those goals, radical changes must occur in all structures of society. Because the organization was heavily joined by working class women, they stressed the importance of equal pay and elimination of segregation which barred women's participation in certain jobs based on marital or other status. Related concerns were state-sponsored child care and maternity benefits, as well as the right of women to choose whether they would become mothers. Support for contraception and regulation of clandestine abortions, since therapeutic abortion was already legal, caused some parts of society to accuse MEMCh members of wanting to destroy the traditions of family. In memchistas (MEMCh members) view, they saw controlling one's biology as a part of women's family rights, including child support, inheritance, legitimacy, pension rights and others. While they strove for women's suffrage, attaining the vote was only one step toward increasing women's participation in the public sphere. MEMCh members focused their efforts on women's issues throughout the social spectrum including the families of the urban poor, middle classes and educated elites. Social issues MEMCh supported were the availability of sanitary, affordable housing; assistance for alcoholism; reform of women's prisons; and equal access to education. MEMCh was the first women's group to use mass mobilization through public events, held not only in Santiago but also in the provinces. They held rallies for votes and political freedom, and in favor of regulations dealing with the high unemployment and subsistence living; and others against a military pact between Chile and the United States, and sending Chilean troops to participate in the Korean War. MEMch developed an educational work, hosting schools for workers and job training courses, and created social service facilities to provide health care and legal advice. In the 1940s, the organization strongly opposed fascism, but rumors and actual links with communism of some of the feminists led to public defamation of several members and press which was critical of their objectives. MEMch joined the Popular Front and held two congresses (1937, 1940) to gather information from various sectors to create a platform which would address the issues that women faced. When Pedro Aguirre Cerda was elected as president, he agreed to introduce the issue of women's right to vote. In 1941, Caffarena and Flor Heredia drafted a proposal for consideration, but Cerdo died before it was introduced. In 1944, MEMCh organized a meeting held at the University of Chile in celebration of International Women's Day and that was followed by another congress, organized by Felisa Vergara. She brought together women from 200 different women's organizations, who agreed to align in an organization, (). FECHIF in turn backed the candidacy of Mar√≠a de la Cruz in 1946, but MEMCh adhered to the Popular Front candidate, Gabriel Gonz√°lez Videla, believing that though charismatic, de la Cruz's vision was too narrow to support the needs of a wide constituency of women. After Gonz√°lez Videla's election to the presidency in 1946, moderate members' relationships were strained by the anti-communist policies ushered in by the Cold War and the leftist leanings of many MEMch members. In 1949, having survived the government decision to outlaw the Communist Party and state harassment aimed at curtailing its activities, Chilean women gained universal suffrage. Membership turned their attention to pacifism and campaigns to protect children. The organization survived until 1953, when it was dissolved. Though specific reasons for the dissolution are unknown, the political polarization and MEMCh's refusal to exclude anyone for their political views and factionalism dividing the focus to interest groups were contributing factors. Current Organization In 1983, MEMCh83, named after the original organization, was founded by a broad spectrum of women's groups, some with feminist aims and others without feminist goals. The umbrella organization's purpose was to unite women's efforts in the restoration of democracy during the Chilean dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. Initially the organization made no demands for women's rights, but when MEMCh83 organized its first mass mobilization on 28 November 1983, they expressed opposition to Pinochet and demanded peace and women's equality. In 1985, the organization was established as MEMch, under a non-governmental organizational structure. Since democracy was restored in 1988, the organization has focused on joining a broad coalition of Chilean NGOs in the advocacy of women's equality, which includes their reproductive and sexual rights, as well as all aspects of development.

As the head of the Tunisian Journalists Union (SNJT-French: Syndicat National des Journalistes Tunisiens) and human rights activist Lutfi Hajji writes, the coalition ‚Äúexpressed the long- cherished hope of the political and civil forces in the country that by rallying around basic claims, a balance could be reached between the ruling party, which had dominated all aspects of political life for half a century, and the opposition forces which remained disparate and hindered by their internal and external disputes.‚Äù The Coalition arose out of a protest, organised by opposition and human rights groups, against the hosting of the United Nations-sponsored World Summit on the Information Society by Tunisia, in November 2005. The sit-in involved a 52-day protest at the headquarters of the Tunisian Order of Lawyers in Tunis and a 32-day hunger strike by the following eight national personalities representing various political parties and civil organisations: Abderraouf Ayadi, Ahmed Najib Chebbi, Samir Dilou, Hamma Hammami, Mohamed Nouri, Ayachi Hammami, Mokhtar Yahyaoui and Lutfi Hajji. The strike began on 18 October 2005, one month before the World Summit on the Information Society, in order to draw attention to the violations of basic freedoms in Tunisia. The demands were: * Freedom of association for all * Freedom of information and expression * Release of political prisoners A forum was formed in which the opposition groups elaborated a shared vision for a democratic Tunisia. The Coalition produced joint position papers on fundamental issues such as consensus on democracy, civil liberties, gender equality, freedom of belief and conscience and the relationship between religion and state. The Coalition also laid the foundation for future common ground between Tunisia‚Äôs main political opposition forces, which served as a basis for cooperation after the Revolution.

Born in London and raised in New York City, she married a London-born slave merchant and reared a family of nine children. While committed to Jewish observance, she and her family also socialized freely in the wider Christian society. Theirs was considered one of the prominent families of colonial New York. She is known for the letters she wrote to her eldest son, Naphtali, after he moved to England. Spanning the years 1733 to 1748, these letters describe the political and social milieu of 18th-century New York, together with the assimilation and interfaith marriage that affected Jewish families. Two of Abigail's children married outside of the religion and all of her grandchildren assimilated. By the end of the 18th century, she had no Jewish descendants. Early life Bilhah Abigail Levy was born in London to Moses (Raphael) Levy, a German‚ÄìJewish merchant, and his wife Richea (Rycha) Asher. She had four brothers. Her father relocated the family to New York City in the early 1700s and became a wealthy, respected merchant in international trade. Abigail received a \\"formal, classical education\\". Her mother died when she was 11 and her father remarried to Grace Mears, with whom he had eight more children. Marriage and family In 1712 at the age of 16, Abigail married Jacob Franks (1688‚Äì1769), a London-born businessman. The couple had nine children between the years 1715 and 1742; two died in childhood. They were married for 44 years until Abigail's death. The Jewish population of Colonial New York at that time was minuscule, comprising only about 50 families. Nevertheless, Abigail ran a traditional Jewish home, including strict Sabbath observance, Jewish holiday observance, and a kosher kitchen. All her children received \\"Hebrew instruction\\" and were familiar with the prayers. The family were members of Congregation Shearith Israel; Jacob served as president of the synagogue in 1730. At the same time, the Franks were active members of the wider Christian society. Jacob established himself in a variety of trades, including \\"the slave trade, privateering, general commerce, and shipping\\", and became quite wealthy. The Franks were considered one of the leading families of New York in the Colonial era. Residing on the East River, they lived in proximity to Adolphus Philipse, Frederick and Jacobus Van Cortlandt, Robert Livingston, Abraham de Peyster, and Stephen Bayard, all prominent Protestants and civic leaders. Jacob and his father-in-law, Moses Levy, were among the 11 Jews who helped pay for a steeple for the First Trinity Church in Manhattan, which served as a beacon for incoming ships. Abigail had many close friends who were Christian and spent summer holidays with them. Beginning around 1732, Abigail and Jacob began sending their children to England to learn the family business. Sons Naphtali and Moses both established themselves in England and helped develop their father's business interests; David did the same after moving to Philadelphia. With the limited number of Jewish marriage prospects in colonial America, the Franks family's comfort level with Christian society, and the willingness of Protestant families to wed their children to their Jewish neighbors, two of Abigail's children intermarried. Abigail broke off all contact with her eldest daughter, Phila, after the latter secretly married Oliver De Lancey, the scion of a Christian Huguenot merchant family in New York; Phila later converted to Christianity. (Jacob, however, accepted the marriage, as it \\"allied the Franks clan with the well-connected DeLanceys\\".) David married the daughter of one of Abigail's Christian friends. Naphtali and Moses both married Jewish first-cousins in England, but all of their offspring assimilated. It is unknown if any of Abigail's other children married. By the end of the 18th century, she had no Jewish descendants. Letters Abigail kept up a lively correspondence with her eldest son, Naphtali, in England. Thirty-four of her letters survive, as well as one letter from Jacob and two letters from David. The collection of letters dates from 7 May 1733 to 30 October 1748. The letters cover a range of topics, including family and community gossip, local politics, and Abigail's observations on the current state and future of Judaism in colonial New York. While Abigail embraced Jewish observance and thought it important that her children marry within the fold, she was critical of contemporary Jewish practice. In her letters she expressed a desire to inject more modernity into the religion to counter its \\"Many Supersti[ti]ons\\", and denigrated the Jewish women of New York as \\"a Stupid Set of people\\". She describes the lives of other Jewish American women of the era, including her stepmother, Grace Mears Levy, and Grace's eldest daughter, Rachel Levy, who married Isaac Mendes Seixas, a Sephardi Jew. Abigail, of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, did not socialize with Sephardi Jews, although some were members of her synagogue. She wrote to her son about Rachel's marriage proposal: \\"The Portugeuze here are in a great ferment abouth it. And think Very Ill of him.\\" Like her contemporaries, Abigail's spelling skills were wanting, but she enjoyed reading classical literature and contemporary magazines. She often quoted lines from the English poets John Dryden, Alexander Pope, and Joseph Addison, as well as contemporary writers, in her correspondence. Franks-Levy portraits The Franks and Levy families commissioned a series of seven portraits depicting three generations of family members. Donated to the American Jewish Historical Society in 1951 and currently housed at the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas, these portraits in their original frames are \\"the oldest surviving portraits of colonial American Jews, and the oldest family-series portraits to survive in all of American painting\\". The portraits ‚Äì of Moses Levy, Grace Mears Levy, Jacob Franks, Abigail Franks, Naphtali Franks, and two other children of Abigail and Jacob ‚Äì are believed to have been painted in the 1720s and 1730s by Gerardus Duyckinck. They reflect the \\"costume, background, and pose\\" of English aristocrats and give no indication that the subjects are Jewish. While Abigail mentions several portrait commissions in her letters to Naphtali, these seven portraits were not mentioned, leading some scholars to question whether they actually depict the Franks-Levy family members.

He published a number of books and papers on television engineering. Early years Townsend was born in London during 1919. At school his hard work and good results won him a scholarship from an LCC Primary School to a Grammar School, where he became Captain of Athletics as well as School Captain. As a small schoolboy he was televised by John Logie Baird although he had to stand on a box to bring his face up to the scanning disc. Baird was at the time (1925) holding his first public demonstration of television at Selfridges department store on Oxford Street in London, a short distance from where Townsend lived. Baird was demonstrating his 30-line system at 5 frames per second, and was only able to generate silhouettes. It was nonetheless fitting that the 6 year old Townsend happened to be shopping with his mother and come across the very start of television at the start of his own life. He was awarded the Sambrooke Scholarship to King‚Äôs College, University of London, where he read Physics, and continued to develop his passion for playing rugby. His rugby career culminated in him playing for the now famous London based Saracens FC. Townsend‚Äôs main studies were in atomic physics and Maxwell‚Äôs electro-magnetic theory. In 1940 he graduated from King‚Äôs College with a first class honours degree in Physics and a diploma in Divinity. Townsend would eventually earn a Ph.D from University of London. Professional life At the age of 21 Townsend joined the British General Electric Co. Ltd at their Hirst Research Laboratories in Wembley, London and soon became one of the senior research engineers. For the remainder of the Second World War he worked on various secret projects including torpedo guidance systems and radar. Most notably he was the senior engineer of the team that created the first airborne radar system, which for the first time allowed allied aircraft to find and track enemy planes both at night and in cloudy conditions. With the end of the war in 1945 he started work on television transmission and reception just before the television service reopened. During the second world war the UK government had shut down the television service to concentrate on the war effort. The valves (vacuum tubes) developed by Townsend and his team at the GEC Research Laboratories for radar, were later used in the creation of their colour television design. While working for GEC, on 31 October 1958 he filed a patent application for specific elements of his television design which was later granted (No. 875,876). Townsend had a number of other patents filed under his own name including the Automatic Saturation Control for Colour-Television Receiver and a Compensator for colour-television receivers for chromaticity variations in ambient light. In 1961 after 20 years in the Research Laboratories of the GEC, he set up and became Manager of the Television Department of GEC (Electronics) Ltd, making professional colour television monitors. It was here that he designed the first colour television to be mass- produced in the UK. Part of his team's accomplishments was the setting up of a complete colour studio in the New Horticultural Halls in the Victoria district of London. It was from here they broadcast the first public demonstration in the UK, of a live colour television studio production titled \\"The New TV Show\\" on 19 August 1961. He moved to Rank Cintel Television at Sydenham in 1963, first as Technical Manager where he was concerned with the development and manufacture of telecine machines and video tape equipment along with other professional studio equipment, then as Manager. Townsend obtained his doctorate from the Faculty of Science at the University of London in 1965 for his thesis on colour television. A year later he joined ABC in March 1966 and later that year was made a fellow of the Royal Television Society (RTS). As colour television became more widespread, he was instrumental in establishing the new techniques required for making film with the correct characteristics suitable for colour television transmission. After several years at ABC Television ‚Äì which became Thames Television ‚Äì as Head of Engineering Research, in 1972 Townsend joined the Independent Broadcasting Authority Headquarters staff where he became Head of Engineering Information Service. Townsend was well known for his ability to convey complex technical principles in a clear and interesting manner, frequently including an entertaining anecdote. He was widely considered to be a leading expert in his field and was on occasion called as an expert witness in court cases such as a patent action in the 1970s for EMI. Townsend was regularly quoted in the media about how he saw the development of television progressing, with what turned out to be with great accuracy. the New Scientist on 9 March reported him predicting that we would see dedicated communication satellites being used for broadcasting television pictures over multiple countries from one satellite, with different sound tracks available simultaneously in different languages. He also predicted that the same satellites would be used by foreign news reports to send live reports direct to our homes. Townsend claimed to have tried his hand at most jobs in television, from acting in front of the cameras to designing and making most types of equipment. He has served on numerous national and international committees, including the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) committee concerned with the choice of standards for the European colour television system. Works Townsend presented a paper titled \\"The physiology and psychology of colour\\" at the BBC International Television Design Conference ‚Äì Colour ‚Äì on 8 November 1968 at the Television Centre, White City, London. It has since appeared as an article in the British Journal of Photography and was published by the British Board of Television Advertising (BBTA) in 1969. The BBTA commissioned him to write two further papers on Colour Television Reproduction, Colour Telecines and Standardisation, Technical standards of colour film for television advertising. While at GEC Townsend and his team built up a great deal of knowledge of the NTSC television system. This knowledge produced Townsend's most noticeable books on colour television engineering. His first book published in 1961, Colour Television: N.T.S.C. System, Principles and Practice, covered the basic principles and in particular the NTSC system, while the second book, Colour Television (1969) in collaboration with his GEC colleague Peter Carnt, covered PAL, SECAM and other systems. Townsend's first two books on colour television engineering quickly became some of the definitive reference books in their field, often cited as references in other publications, and even in patent disputes. Lectures Townsend presented the prestigious RTS Fleming Memorial Lecture titled \\"A Television Service Fit for Artists\\" on his birthday 13 April 1972. This led to him giving a number of prestigious lectures including the Sylvanus P Thompson event for the IEE. Townsend's superb presentation skills were put to good use in \\"The Entreating Electron\\" lecture which he presented with his colleague Howard Steele. They toured the UK in 1975 and 1976, presenting this elaborately staged series of IEE Faraday Lectures attracting large audiences. It proved so popular that it was broadcast on the UK television network HTV in 1975 as well as being released on VHS video cassette. Later years After his retirement from the IBA in 1984, Townsend worked as a senior consultant on television engineering projects around the world, through John Tucker Associates on Craven Street, London. Awards and honours Townsend was awarded an MBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours List of 1982 for his contribution to television engineering. Affiliations and memberships Townsend was a Fellow of the Institute of Physics, Institution of Electrical Engineers, Royal Television Society, British Kinematograph, Sound and Television Society, and the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers. He served as Chairman of the Royal Television Society for a number of years and was President of the British Amateur Television Club from 1960 to 1964.

His father Gjon Kastrioti was an Albanian lord who had possessions in the Mat region. His mother was Voisava, whose origin is disputed.; It is unknown when Stanisha and his brothers were born, while his younger brother Skanderbeg is taken to have been born in 1405. He also had brothers Reposh and Kostandin, and five sisters, Mara, Jelena, Angelina, Vlajka and Mamica. The names of Stanisha and most of his siblings are Slavic. His father became an Ottoman vassal at the end of the 14th century, and as such, paid tribute and provided military services (like in the Battle of Ankara in 1402). In 1409, one of the brothers, believed by Anamali and Frash√´ri to have been Stanisha, was sent to the Ottoman court as a hostage, to ensure loyalty of Gjon Kastrioti as an Ottoman vassal to the sultan., Gjon accepted the suzerainty of the Republic of Venice in 1413, but was again in Ottoman vassalage by 1415. In the 1419‚Äì26 period Gjon was an ally of Serbian Despot Stefan Lazareviƒá, who was also an Ottoman vassal, and had informed the Republic of Venice during the Second Scutari War (1419‚Äì23) between Venice and Serbia that he was compelled to give his son as a hostage to Despot Stefan. According to Fan Noli it was Stanisha who was sent by his father, together with auxiliary forces, to help the Serbians against the Venetians at Scutari. Gjon issued a charter in Old Serbian to the Serbian Orthodox Hilandar monastery on Mount Athos in 1425‚Äì26, in which he donated the two villages of Radostu≈°a (which included a church) and Trebi≈°te to the Hilandar, and mentioned his four sons by name. In a charter issued by Hilandar between 1426 and 1431, the monastery granted the temporary purchase by Gjon and his sons, except Stanisha, to four adelphates (rights to reside on monastic territory and receive subsidies from monastic resources) of the St. George tower (later named the \\"Albanian tower\\" in their honour). Scholars have noticed that Stanisha was not mentioned in this second charter, and considered that he was Turkified immediately after 1426, likely around 1428. That claim is however not supported by documents. It was also believed that he \\"disappeared\\", however, it was found that he was mentioned as the son of deceased Gjon Kastrioti in a Venetian document dated 12 February 1445. That document does not bring any conclusion as to the possible Turkification of Stanisha. The Venetian government confirmed the earlier duties held by the father of Skanderbeg and Stanisha, and promised them Venetian citizenship and shelter if they were to be expelled from their lands.

Early life Shahid was born in Toronto, Canada and spent his childhood and teenage years in Pakistan, attending schools in Lahore and Karachi. Early in his career, he drew political cartoons for the Pakistani publications Star, Dawn and Newsline Magazine. After graduation he studied architecture in Canada, attending both Carleton and McGill University. Shahid‚Äôs cartoons focus largely on religion and politics, with his critiques targeting both Islamic fundamentalism and the aggressiveness of US foreign policy. Over the years, he has received threats to his well-being from groups ranging from the Taliban to various government officials. Career His cartoons were a part of the exhibition showing at the 1997 APEC Conference. Following the 9/11 Attacks, Shahid exhibited work at the Paris exhibition The New World Order. In 2002 his exhibition Enduring Operation Freedom, criticizing the Bush policies in Afghanistan, resulted in the McMaster Museum of Art in Canada shutting down the event. While working in Pakistan, Shahid faced repeated attempts at censorship by the government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who was featured in several of Shahid‚Äôs works. His cartoons have been preserved in various institutions including the Museum of Contemporary History in Paris. He has published his work in publications including The Huffington Post, The Guardian, The Express Tribune, Courrier International, and The New York Times Press Syndicate. Shahid has commented on both the Jyllands-Posten cartoon controversy and the related Charlie Hebdo aftermath.http://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2647945139; http://www.newstalk.com/The-trouble-with-the-Charlie-Hebdo-drawings Censorship Shahid is mentioned as being one of the first Canadians to be flagged on the US No Fly List. The Canadian Parliament debated his story, and in an open letter released by Amnesty International December 2007 Shahid‚Äôs case was cited as a prime reason to implement the recommendations made by the Arar Commission that advocate for balanced and transparent security measures in Canada. Shahid claims that his criticisms of US foreign policy and military interventionism resulted in him being denied boarding to a domestic Air Canada flight in 2004. Following this, he began to receive extra screening on a routine basis by airlines in many countries. In 2009 a racial profiling complaint regarding the incident was argued in front of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. In 2010 Shahid settled the case with Air Canada. The short documentary, ‚ÄúListed‚Äù narrates some of the details of this incident. In 2012 Shahid was again detained in the Santiago International Airport and interviewed by Interpol for 90 minutes, indicating he was still on a US government security list. He was later assigned a specialized PIN from US Homeland Security to help deal with the appearance of his name on security lists. Shahid has also received threats from Islamic fundamentalists for his works criticizing fundamentalism, including an image of the Taliban depicted as an ape reading an upside-down Qur‚Äôan. He has written and spoken over the years on issues related to satire and censorship in newsprint, radio, and television.

First observed over the Leeward Islands on August 17, the storm continued northwest, passing over Puerto Rico and the northern coastline of Hispaniola. It moved through the Turks and Caicos Islands and then the Bahamas by August 21 and curved northward. Although there is some discrepancy in its track, the hurricane moved ashore somewhere along the North Carolina coastline on August 25, perhaps at Category 4 intensity on the modern-day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. The cyclone emerged back into the Atlantic Ocean around Norfolk, Virginia, and grazed the New England coastline before last being observed offshore Nova Scotia on August 28\\\\. Along its track, numerous vessels were damaged, capsized, or run aground. The combination of heavy rainfall and ferocious winds caused severe crop damage, damaged or destroyed structures, and snapped and uprooted trees. Overall, the storm was responsible for more than six deaths and at least two injuries. Meteorological synopsis The origin of the 1827 North Carolina hurricane is unclear in the absence of reliable data across the Atlantic Ocean, but it is surmised the storm began as a classic Cape Verde hurricane. On a west- northwest track, the hurricane moved through the Lesser Antilles on August 17 and August 18, grazing the coastline of Hispaniola the following day. It reached the Turks and Caicos Islands on August 20 and the Bahamas on August 21, subsequently curving northward east of Florida and South Carolina a few days later.Ludlum 1963, p. 119 On August 25, the storm ‚Äì thought to have been as strong as Category 4 strength on the modern-day Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale ‚Äì moved ashore along the North Carolina coastline. Its exact landfall point remains unclear, with one study suggesting a landfall along the Outer Banks,Fraser 2009, p. 99 and a second study concluding a landfall along the Carolinas border on the basis of surface observations from Wilmington, North Carolina.Hairr 2008 Nonetheless, the storm then turned northeast and emerged into the Atlantic around Norfolk, Virginia. It grazed the New England coastline before being last documented around Sable Island offshore Nova Scotia on August 28. Impact and aftermath Map of the Carolinas in 1827 The 1827 hurricane first made its presence known in Antigua and Saint Croix on August 17, where on the latter island the wind was regarded as \\"the worst in forty years\\" and continued for up to ten hours. In nearby Saint Kitts, the storm was considered the most violent in half a century. Puerto Rico bore the brunt of the cyclone on August 18, where severe crop damage was reported. Offshore the Southeastern United States, the ship Lavinia en route to New Orleans from New York City intercepted the powerful hurricane. A combination of high waves and strong winds caused severe damage to the vessel, and it was saved only by the storm's passage. Almost simultaneously, the ship Brandt from Charleston, South Carolina bound for New York encountered winds that \\"blew a perfect hurricane,\\" with its sails torn apart and reduced to bare poles. Tumbled about by southwesterly winds and a strong current, the vessel soon found itself in waves, with up to of standing water in the hold. A 14-year-old boy was washed overboard. Aided by a French frigate, as well as a lessening of the tumultuous weather, the ship eventually found ground in Norfolk.Fraser 2009, p. 98 In late August, passengers aboard the schooner Mary Ellen from Baltimore observed a second schooner partially disassembled. She soon also intercepted the system and was knocked on its side by a large wave. It was righted and continued on its course to Charleston, but not before sustaining substantial damage. Another schooner, the Solon from New Orleans, passed through the hurricane offshore the Georgia or South Carolina coastlines. Massive waves wrecked the ship, washing overboard all passengers except the captain and his crew member. Both men were rescued by the Mary Eleanor of Savannah, Georgia, but the captain died a day later from fatigue. Although the eye of the cyclone passed well east of Charleston, winds \\"blew with great violence\\" for six hours. Only minimal damage occurred in the city and surrounding areas as the storm passed by during low tide. Throughout North Carolina, the 1827 hurricane was considered more severe than a similar-tracked cyclone that impacted the region 12 years prior. In the city of Wilmington, a few buildings saw their chimneys destroyed, roofs ripped off, and fences flattened. One resident recounted that waves washed above garden fences up to inland, while other reports suggested that storm tides surpassed above normal levels. Less than a dozen vessels were driven ashore along the banks of the Cape Fear River. Outside the city, the hurricane widened the Masonboro Sound by at least and destroyed several of the accompanied saltworks. Fayetteville recorded a 30-hour period of gales and rain, where an abundant corn crop sustained insignificant loss. The cotton and tobacco crops did not fare so well, and many roads were rendered impassible by fallen trees or high water. Raleigh, meanwhile, saw many of its water courses flooded, mills and bridges carried off, and trees and chimneys downed. Corn and cotton crops were in some cases torn to pieces, and piles of wheat which had been stacked in fields were swept downstream. In Bethabara, or modern-day Winston‚ÄìSalem, the hurricane's onslaught downed fences, tore off roofs, and damaged orchards and forests. Several bridges were swept away by floodwaters, and numerous washed-out roadways impeded travel for weeks following the storm's passage. In Washington, floodwaters rose to as much as in the first floor of houses along Water Street,Ludlum 1963, p. 120 while storm tides exceeded . One schooner was driven aground causing damage to a wharf while several others combined to dislodge and carry away a bridge. Most crops were destroyed. In nearby New Bern, residents were forced to navigate the city by canoe. Across Ocracoke, five out of the six vessels harbored in Wallace's Channel were driven aground, with the remaining craft being blown into the Pamlico Sound. Two packet boats from New York were pushed ashore and smashed to pieces. A newly placed lightship off Ocracoke Inlet broke loose and was pushed onto Ocracoke Island, where the captain, his wife, and their three daughters were rescued. At Cedar Hummock, a large ship en route from the Bay of Honduras to London ran aground during the height of the hurricane but was set back on its way after the storm passed. The ships Amphibious and Mary were both wrecked and pushed ashore near Portsmouth, and both captains drowned. The most well-known encounter with this hurricane came about offshore Cape Hatteras, where the Diamond Shoals lightship was positioned just four years prior. Rough seas created by the hurricane broke the ship from its moorings and drove it ashore on the Core Banks near Portsmouth, drowning the carpenter and the ship's mate in the process. No new lightship was replaced in this position for another half a century. Around the cape itself, only two out of twenty sails along Portsmouth Road were spared from running aground or being carried out to sea. Only one mill in remained standing after the hurricane's passage. After departing North Carolina, the hurricane tracked through southern Virginia, where it was described as \\"a severe gale which continued for three days changed the climate here entirely ...\\" Thanks to a subsiding tide, damage along the coastline of Virginia was not nearly as severe as the 1821 Norfolk and Long Island hurricane, although winds were said to have been just as intense. Still, fodder was rendered useless, and many corn crops were damaged. A two-story building on Talbot Street in Norfolk had its second floor carried downwind, numerous cattle were swept away, and a mill dam was completely destroyed, with the bridge above it removed in the process. In Nansemond County, fruit trees were severely damaged. Along the James River, the low-grounds were completely submerged; crops along the waterway were also ruined. A brick building was destroyed, a team boat was sunk at its wharf, and some ships at the Navy Yard were ripped from their fasts but otherwise sustained no damage. The schooner Albion was gravely injured when nearly all of its sails were blown away, when it lost its main, jib-boom, and fore-top mast, and when all objects were swept off the ship's deck, including the caboose. Two crew members sustained injuries. Around Hampton, the pilot boats James Barron, Virginia and Mary Ann were both run aground. In Gloucester County, corn crops were damaged. The sloop Flag was capsized on the Middle Ground of the Chesapeake River with no survivors. The brig Liberty from Boston ran aground on the south side of Portsmouth, while the schooner Mulberry sustained severe damage; passengers overthrew cargo to prevent the ship from sinking. As far north as Baltimore, it is said \\"considerable mischief\\" was inflicted by the hurricane. In New York City, two vessels were pushed ashore while two pleasure boats were overturned along the East River. Heavy rainfall and gale-force winds were recorded throughout Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Cape Cod. As president, John Quincy Adams had previously disallowed trade between the United States and West Indies during his tenure. However, following the passage of the 1827 hurricane, the politician allowed free trade for three months. Presidential candidate Andrew Jackson soon became outspoken against cutting ties between the two regions, and his support for free trade garnered support from shipping interests that helped him win the presidency a year later.Barnes 1998, p. 55 Notes =Footnotes= =Citations= =References=  * 1827 1827 North Carolina 1827 1827 1827 1827 1827 1827 1827 1827 hurricane Category:1827 in Connecticut Category:1827 in Florida Territory Category:1827 in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:1827 in Massachusetts Category:1827 in New York (state) Category:1827 in North Carolina Category:1827 in South Carolina Category:1827 in Virginia Category:1820s meteorology Category:1820s natural disasters ","title":"1827 North Carolina hurricane"},{"id":"53934433","text":"Chronicon Beneventanum (Beneventan Chronicle) is the conventional title of two historical works: *Annales Beneventani, covering the years 781‚Äì1130 *Chronicon Beneventanum of Falco of Benevento, covering the years 1102‚Äì39 ","title":"Chronicon Beneventanum"},{"id":"53934440","text":"Stockton is an unincorporated community in Jefferson Township, Owen County, in the U.S. state of Indiana.

The creek flows about in a northeasterly direction from south of Flagstaff to near Winona. Geography Walnut Creek begins in a small valley near Mormon Mountain, in the Coconino National Forest. It flows northwest along the south side of Anderson Mesa where it is impounded in two reservoirs, Upper and Lower Lake Mary, which were dammed in the early 1900s to supply water to Flagstaff, several miles to the north. Before damming, Walnut Creek was one of the only reliable streams in this arid region, flowing consistently each spring with the melting of snowpack on the Colorado Plateau. After the Upper Lake Mary Dam was constructed in 1941, Walnut Creek dried up below the Lower Lake Mary Dam due to increased water diversions. Since then, the creek has flowed only during monsoon rains or exceptionally heavy snowmelt. The creek makes a sharp turn to the east at Fisher Point and carves the narrow, winding Walnut Canyon, a limestone gorge up to deep. About east of Flagstaff it passes through Walnut Canyon National Monument, known for its cliff dwellings constructed by the Sinagua people between 1100-1250 A.D. Near the end of the canyon the creek approaches Winona and crosses under Interstate 40, before flowing north to its confluence with the Rio de Flag, forming San Francisco Wash. San Francisco Wash continues east, eventually discharging into Padre Canyon Wash, in turn flowing into Diablo Wash which joins the Little Colorado River near Leupp, Arizona.

Agenda There had been multiple competing agendas leading up to the summit, with Southern European members concerned with security in North Africa and the Middle East and the European migrant crisis and Eastern European members concerned more about Russia's policies. There was also concern about the Russia‚ÄìTurkey relationship. Donald Trump, the President of the United States, urged the NATO members to meet the 2014 agreement to seek to spend at least two percent of their gross domestic product on defense. According to at least one senior White House official, Donald Trump had expressed interest in inviting Russia to the G7 summit and was considering leaving the NATO alliance. During the opening ceremony of the new NATO headquarters building, President Trump gave a speech which did not mention Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, surprising H. R. McMaster, the National Security Advisor, James Mattis, the United States Secretary of Defense, and Rex Tillerson, the United States Secretary of State, who had approved a different speech that explicitly included the collective security commitment. Accomplishments NATO was set to become a full member of the Global Coalition, alongside NATO pledging to increase its support to the Coalition. A terrorism intelligence cell was agreed to be set up within the new intelligence division, which is intended to improve the sharing of information between members. The Alliance leaders agreed to submit national action plans by December, which were to set out how members intend to meet the pledge to spend at least two percent of their GDP on defense by 2024. Montenegro, represented by the prime minister Du≈°ko Markoviƒá, joined the meeting, days before it was to officially become a member of the organization on 5 June 2017. The possibility of NATO membership was said to remain open to other states. Aftermath A few days after, also following a G7 meeting, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a crowd in a Bavarian beer hall that \\"we Europeans must really take our fate into our own hands ‚Äì of course in friendship with the United States of America, in friendship with Great Britain and as good neighbors wherever that is possible also with other countries, even with Russia. But we have to know that we must fight for our future on our own, for our destiny as Europeans.\\"After summits with Trump, Merkel says Europe must take fate into own hands Reuters, 29 May 2017.

It has a rosette of leaves and a single green and white flower which leans forward and has a brownish point on the end. It is a rare orchid, occurring at only one site with fewer than 100 individual plants and is thought to be a natural hybrid between two species that grow nearby. Description Pterostylis aenigma has a rosette of between three and eight dark green, fleshy, flat leaves, each leaf long and wide. A single green and white flower is borne on a flowering spike high. The flowers are long, wide and lean forward or \\"nod\\". The dorsal sepal and petals are joined and curve forward forming a hood over the column. The dorsal sepal is longer than the petals and has a pointed tip. The tip of the hood is brownish. There is a notch in the sinus between the lateral sepals and a large gap between the lateral sepals and petals. The lateral sepals are olive brown and have thread- like tips long. The labellum protrudes through the sinus and is long, about wide, curved, dark brown and blunt. Flowering occurs between November and December. Taxonomy and naming Pterostylis aenigma was first described in 1993 by David Jones and Mark Clements from a specimen collected near Omeo. The description was published in Muelleria. The authors noted that this species is possibly a hybrid between Pterostylis cucullata and P. furcata (later corrected to P. falcata), both of which grow nearby. It is now accepted as Pterostylis x aenigma by some authorities. The specific epithet (aenigma) is said to be a Latin word meaning \\"obscure, puzzling, baffling\\", in reference to the puzzling taxonomy and distribution of this orchid. In classical Latin, aenigma is not an adjective but a noun, meaning \\"that which is dark, obscure, or inexplicable; a riddle, enigma, obscurity\\".Lewis, C.T. & Short, C. (1879). A Latin dictionary founded on Andrews' edition of Freund's Latin dictionary. Oxford: Clarendon Press. Distribution and habitat The enigmatic greenhood grows in moist places near streams in open forest at an altitude of near Omeo. Conservation About 50 plants of Pterostylis aenigma were known in 2003 but only five were located in 2005.

Cast * Kay Parker as Barbara Scott * Dorothy LeMay as Sherry * Mike Ranger as Paul Scott * Miko Yani as Girl with Gina * Juliet Anderson as Gina * Tawny Pearl as Diane * Lee LeMay as Charlie * Turk Lyon as Chris Scott * Milton Ingley as Jerry Morgan (as Michael Morrison) * Holly McCall as Marlene * Don Fernando - Guy with Gina * Jesse Adams - Swinger, Moustache * Brooke West - Swinger, Purple Jacket * Sarah Harris - Swinger * T.J.

The recognition was considered by many as a turning point in the acceptance of adult entertainment by the mainstream video industry. At Website Adams Underground praised Kay Parker's performance (\\"(Parker)...envelops the role of Barbara with a gentle, sensuous mist of sophisticated feminine allure that tantalizes with tangible passion stirring deep within that magnificent bosom\\") and the movie's visuals. But criticed the unrealistic portrayal of incest, the movie's ending and several technical aspects of the film, including the editing and the sound. Concluding:\\"In closing, all of Taboo's flaws amount to nothing more than a quickly forgotten boo-boo that Barbara sweetly kisses away with a warm tenderness that leaves you with indelible, pleasant memories.\\". Roger Feelbert from Pornonomy gave the film a B+ rating, stating: \\"Overall, Taboo was well paced and acted and while I personally think it could have benefited from a slightly darker tone (something akin to 3 AM), as its own entity it's befitting of the place it holds in porn history.\\" Roger T. Pipe from Rogreviews gave the film 11 out of 12 stars and said about \\"Taboo\\": \\"I don't think anyone is going to pick this up expecting a modern raincoater flick. If you were looking for that, please look elsewhere. The sex scenes are short, softer than we are used to and simply not up to the best of what we get these days. That's the down side of course. On the bright side, we get to see a classic. It is pretty easy to see why this is an all-time favorite. Kay Parker is a stunning woman who handles a rather difficult role. The script is pretty basic, but it is certainly has more emotional depth than most anything we see these days. Both she and Ranger are impressive in this film. The story touches on a number of things that would, if you will pardon me, taboo issues even today. Real incest, that is to say the portrayal of a genuinely incestuous relationship in porn today is nearly non-existent. That helps make the original \\"Taboo\\" somewhat edgy nearly thirty years after its release.\\". Steve Pulaski from Steve The Movie Man called the film a \\"landmark in porn...that could very well be considered an early American, feature-length porn film focusing on a fetish, in this case, mother/son incest\\". He also noted that \\"Taboo\\" was written by a woman and in its core, the film is about how women are treated in our society:\\"Amazingly, Taboo was written by a woman named Helene Terrie, which could very well explain the film's sensitive angle. One can easily look at the incest angle, view the mother/son sex scenes as deplorable, and find this film uncommonly offensive. However, one can look at this film as a sensitive portrayal of the desperate measures people can go to in order to combat their own loneliness. The film, at its core, shows how a woman is rejected from everything, society, employers, and even her husband for allegedly not being good enough, and the first time she finally does something she wants, she's overcome with guilt and shame. Who would've thought a pornographic film would ever go this deep (metaphorically speaking)?\\". Still about the movie, Pulaski concluded:\\"The scenes here carry a terrific level of eroticism and hold weight as some of the sexiest I've seen in pornography yet. They are intimate, usually assisted by soft, soulful music choices rather than ones that hinder the scenes themselves, and are beautifully constructed to flow very naturally. It also helps that, again, Parker and Ranger are such talented performers, able to act, have sex, and get emotional all in a film that's very intelligently written, which only elevates the level of believability here. Taboo was a film born to divide in a genre born to be embraced by some and lambasted by others. Yet, it proves that even pornography can tackle a subject with a strong level of thoughtfulness, so much so that perhaps there's another reason why mainstream cinema won't touch the topic of incest with a ten foot pole (again, metaphorically speaking).\\" See also * Golden Age of Porn References External links * Category:1980 films Category:1980s pornographic films Category:American films Category:American pornographic films Category:English-language films Category:Incest pornography Category:MILF pornography Category:Incest in film ","title":"Taboo (1980 film)"},{"id":"53934501","text":"175 West Broadway is a building between Worth and Leonard Streets in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City.

The annal entries were originally annotations written in the margins of Paschal tables, a practice that probably dates to the foundation of the monastery in the second half of the eighth century. The annotations were gathered together and copied into manuscripts in the early twelfth century. Three such manuscripts exist, each copied at Santa Sofia and each presenting a different redaction of the annals.Jakub Kujawinski, \\"Annales Beneventani\\", in R. G. Dunphy, ed., Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle (Leiden and Boston: Brill, 2010), 55‚Äì56.

Version A.1 in manuscript Vatican, BAV, vat. lat. 4928, fol. 1r‚Äì8v, copied between 1113 and 1118, covers the years 787‚Äì1113.

It is found in the same manuscript as the monastery's cartulary, a collection of canon law and a list of the Princes of Benevento. Version A.3 in manuscript Naples, BN, VI E 43, fol. 17r‚Äì18v, copied between 1107 and 1118, has entries for the years from 1096 to 1130. It is the only version in which the annals are marginal annotations to a Paschal table, which would have been the form of the original manuscript(s) from which all three surviving redactions are derived. A fourth redaction once accepted as genuine has been identified as an eighteenth-century forgery. Ottorino Bertolini made the first critical edition based on all three texts in 1923. The Annales have a distinctly Beneventan and south Italian perspective. The succession of Byzantine emperors is recorded into the ninth century, while the neither the Carolingian nor the Ottonian emperors are recognised as such, being referred to only as \\"kings\\". The succession of Princes of Benevento is recorded down to the end the principality around 1050, when the city came under papal rule. Thereafter, the Annales record the succession of popes. The entries are more detailed from the tenth century onwards, but few are about the monastery itself.

As a product is the first tablet designed by Jolla running the company's Sailfish OS, a Linux-based OS built around the Mer (a fork of MeeGo) software components. As a project it is the Jolla project with huge contribution by the MeeGo Sailfish community in development, creating, financing, testing, reporting, support and maintenance, illustrated by slogan \\"People Powered\\". That shaped the final device. In successfully finished crowdfunding campaign over $2.5 million had been raised from 21,633 backers. After multiple issues with production, financing and schedule a small number of devices was shipped in autumn 2015, while the company stated in December 2015, that due to lack of necessary components that are not available any longer the production was stopped Jolla Branded Prototype Awarded in 2015 On the 5 March 2015, on the last day of Mobile World Congress 2015, the Jolla Tablet running with Sailfish OS 2.0, the not yet released prototype, was awarded with \\"The Best Tablet of the whole event\\" prize by Trusted Reviews. The project was unveiled and introduced during the congress for the first time publicly. It was introduction of both: the new OS and the new product. In fact Youyota tablet is the same prototype as in 2017 it was built using original documentation and design data taken from the original designer, so this award is related to Youyota Tablet also. Operating system The tablet was designed to be a host running Sailfish OS 2.0 by Jolla. This allowed and caused significant development and major updates based on predecessor the Sailfish OS 1.0. Fixes and upgrades counted in dozens of thousands, including : * support for new devices has become much easier, * default standard is implemented Wayland (display server protocol) * adaptations needed for the Intel x86 platform and chipset architecture, * further developed (upon requests of Jolla mobile users) including more reliable touch gestures based OS navigation and operations, * homescreen completely rewritten for Sailfish OS 2.0 based on extensive UX prototypes and user studies, * redesigned Startup Wizard flow for the first-time user experience and make Sailfish OS easier to use, * higher display resolutions with bigger display dimensions, * support multiple display sizes and orientations, * browser architecture revamped for better performance and the fully redesigned interface, * apps armed with much more sophisticated error handling, * user hinting and loading indications, * completed readiness for licensing Sailfish OS to 3rd parties vendors with eventual support of designing new mobile products by 3rd parties. The new version 2.0 for the tablet was published at November 2015. =Android software support= Built-in Android compatibility layer of Alien Dalvik allows the usage of software in an emulated Android environment on a Youyota Tablet, without changes to the software nor performance slow-down, as Sailfish OS and Android both use the Linux kernel. Sailfish OS multitasking capabilities allows user switching between software, both native and emulated, running together at the same time on the fly. =Jolla official licensing and support= The Sailfish OS, with built in Alien Dalvik (for Android software support) and MS Exchange, is licensed directly from Jolla. This assures OS compatibility, usage of recent stable dedicated OS version and future maintenance for upgrades according to further OS development by Jolla.  Release  The original launch date for the tablet was stated to be May 2017. The final prototype is to be finished in mid of May 2017. On 16-18th May in Hong Kong the Jolla is present at \\"Critical Communications Finland building trust in CCW2017\\" and Youyota's plan is to have the final prototype presentation with them. Crowd funding for the actual production run started on July 6, 2017. As of early January 2018, despite having been funded at 251% of the goal, the project's fate is uncertain as the costs of several components (memory, PCB) have risen well above expectations.

Her instructors included Chase, T. C. Steele, and William Forsyth. While in Paris she came to know Margaret Cravens, Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, and other members of the American expatriate arts community. From 1903 to 1921 Ullman was married to the artist Eugene Paul Ullman, with whom she had two sons, sculptor Allen and artist Paul. The couple married in Paris and lived abroad, but after their separation she returned to the United States, where from 1917 until 1925 she was active in Provincetown, Massachusetts. There she befriended Eugene O'Neill, at whose wedding to Agnes Boulton she would serve as the sole witness. She exhibited widely after her return, largely in Indiana, and belonged to a number of organizations including the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors and the National Arts Club.

Bontecou Lake straddles the drainage divide between the Wappinger Creek watershed to the west and the Tenmile River. Published estimates of its area vary between and , but even the most conservative figures place it among the largest lakes in Dutchess County. Parts of the lake are designated as a Critical Environmental Area, since the area is a crucial habitat for both migrating and breeding waterfowl. History and geography Aerial view of the lake, looking east Bontecou Lake is located on the property of Rally Farms, founded by Frederic H. Bontecou (who would later be elected a state senator) in 1926. As the farm became renowned for its angus cattle herd, water demands increased. Around 1956, responding to severe drought, Bontecou worked with the Dutchess County Soil and Water Conservation District to construct two earthen dams, impounding an existing, pool of water at the center of a forested wetland known as Tamarack Swamp. The resulting reservoir held approximately of water for agricultural purposes and flooded at least of the swamp, though estimates of its size range as high as . Noted for quality of fishing by the Poughkeepsie Journal in 1968, the lake experienced a severe fish die-off the next year. This was attributed to a harsh winter that killed aquatic plant life in the shallow reservoir, depleting water oxygen levels. The lake, oblong in shape and oriented from northwest‚Äìsoutheast, is surrounded by woods and farmlands. It is bounded on the western end by Shuman Road. Hydrology Bontecou Lake straddles the drainage divide between the Wappinger Creek watershed to the west and the Tenmile River watershed to the east, and it is unclear precisely where in the lake the two drainage basins diverge. The western outflow is unofficially known as Tamarack Swamp Creek, and although its sub-watershed is the sixth largest out of sixteen within the Wappinger Creek catchment area, it only contributes around 2% among major tributaries to the Wappinger Creek's total flow. During a 1999 survey, freshwater flooding from Hurricane Floyd brought Tamarack Swamp Creek discharge to on September 17, compared to amid a dry spell in the previous month. Among the 13 bodies of water larger than partially or wholly within the Wappinger Creek watershed, Bontecou Lake is the only one that has not been assigned a New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) water quality classification. Wildlife and conservation Bontecou Lake is an important wildlife habitat, and in 1987, the town of Stanford designated its portion of the lake, along with parts of the adjacent wetlands, as a Critical Environmental Area to protect the large numbers of migratory and breeding waterfowl that seek refuge there. The NYSDEC also monitors and regulates land usage in a tract surrounding and including the lake, as directed by the New York State Freshwater Wetlands Act of 1975. One of the first breeding pairs of Canada geese in Dutchess County was recorded here in 1964; before that year, only one other nesting site had been observed in the county's history. Today, the lake and swamp are home to hundreds of Canada geese year-round, with many thousands using the area as a stop-over point during migration periods. The first cackling goose ever documented in the county was also spotted at Bontecou Lake in May 1977. Dead trees extending above the surface of the water quickly made this a preferred breeding ground for great blue herons, which continue to nest on the eastern side of the lake. Though only a handful of the trees remain standing, they provide nesting opportunities for several bird species, including the eastern bluebird, for which the partially submerged trees constitute a relatively rare natural breeding site away from buildings and free of competitors. Though located entirely on private property, the lake is a popular destination for birders who have been granted permission to access the land, either individually or through birding club membership.

Conscientious objection is also recognized by the Department of Defense. The Department of Defense defines conscientious objection as a \\"firm, fixed, and sincere objection to participation in war in any form or the bearing of arms, by reason of religious training and/or belief\\". It defines \\"religious training and/or belief\\" as: Conscientious objection must be \\"sincere and meaningful\\" and occupy \\"a place in the life of its possessor parallel to that filled by an orthodox belief in God\\". Any mixture of sincere religious, moral, or ethical beliefs can qualify as conscientious objection. The term \\"religious training and belief\\" does not include essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views, or a merely personal moral code. A conscientious objector may have political, sociological, and philosophical views, but such views are not a replacement for religious and/or moral beliefs. A conscientious objector may still be willing to use force to defend themselves or others, and may even support a state's right to go to war, as long as the individual objects to personal participation in such armed conflict between states or groups. History =American Revolutionary War= During the American Revolutionary War, exemptions varied by state. Pennsylvania required conscientious objectors who would not join companies of voluntary soldiers, called Associations, to pay a fine roughly equal to the time they would have spent in military drill. Quakers who refused this extra tax had their property confiscated. =American Civil War= Conscription in the United States began in the Civil War. Although conscientious objection was not initially part of the draft law, individuals could provide a substitute or pay a commutation fee of $300 ($4,674.34 in 2017) to hire one. A July 4, 1864, amendment to the draft law ended commutation except for those draftees who were \\"conscientiously opposed to the bearing of arms.\\"James W. Geary, We Need Men: The Union Draft in the Civil War, p. 138, citing the text of the amendment. Conscientious objectors in Confederate States initially had few options. Responses included moving to northern states, hiding in the mountains, joining the army but refusing to use a weapon, or being imprisoned. Between late 1862 and 1864 a payment of $500 ($7,790.56 in 2017) into the public treasury exempted conscientious objectors from Confederate military duty. =World War I= John T. Neufeld was a Mennonite World War I conscientious objector sentenced to 15 years hard labor in the military prison at Leavenworth. He was paroled to do dairy work and released after serving five months of his sentence. His diary of army and prison life is published in a collection with three other WWI Mennonite conscientious objectors. In the United States during World War I, conscientious objectors were permitted to serve in noncombatant military roles. About 2000 absolute conscientious objectors refused to cooperate in any way with the military. These men were imprisoned in military facilities such as Fort Lewis (Washington), Alcatraz Island (California) and Fort Leavenworth (Kansas). Some were subjected to treatment such as short rations, solitary confinement and physical abuse severe enough as to cause the deaths of two Hutterite draftees. Eventually, because of the shortage of farm labor, the conscientious objectors were granted furloughs either for farm service or relief work in France under the American Friends Service Committee. A limited number performed alternative service as fire fighters in the Cascade Range in the vicinity of Camp Lewis, Washington and in a Virginia psychiatric hospital. =World War II= During World War II, all registrants were sent a questionnaire covering basic facts about their identification, physical condition, history and also provided a checkoff to indicate opposition to military service because of religious training or belief. Men marking the latter option received a detailed form in which they had to explain the basis for their objection. Civilian Public Service firefighting crew at Snowline Camp near Camino, California, 1945. Civilian Public Service (CPS) provided conscientious objectors in the United States an alternative to military service during World War II. From 1941 to 1947 nearly 12,000 draftees, unwilling to do any type of military service, performed work of national importance in 152 CPS camps throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. Alternatives to war bonds and war savings stamps were provided for those who would not fund the war for conscientious reasons. The National Service Board for Religious Objectors offered civilian bonds and the Mennonite Central Committee offered Civilian Public Service stamps and War Sufferers' Relief stamps. Civilian Public Service was disbanded in 1947. By the early 1950s a replacement program, 1-W service, was in place for conscientious objectors classified as 1-W by Selective Service. The new program eliminated the base camps of CPS and provided wages for the men. 1-W service was divided into several categories. The Earning Service involved working in institutions such as hospitals for fairly good wages. Voluntary Service was nonpaying work done in similar institutions, mostly within North America. Pax Service was a nonpaying alternative with assignments overseas. 1-W Mission Supporting Service was like the Earning Service but the wages were used for the support of mission, relief or service projects of the draftees choice. The nonpaying services were promoted by church agencies as a sacrifice to enhance the peace witness of conscientious objectors. Desmond Doss, a Seventh-day Adventist, was the first of three conscientious objectors who agreed to serve in the US military in noncombatant roles and were subsequently awarded the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest military decoration. Conscientious objectors with Medals of Honor Desmond T. Doss, a Virginia native and Seventh-day Adventist, desired to perform military service after the start of World War II. While enlisting with the intention of becoming a combat medic, Doss tried to claim noncombatant status but was told that the military did not recognize the designation. He was informed that he should register as a conscientious objector. Doss personally preferred to be called a \\"conscientious cooperator\\" because he would willingly serve his country, wear a uniform, salute the flag, and help with the war effort. Nevertheless, Doss accepted the designation \\"conscientious objector\\" in order to join the army and avoid a Section 8 discharge on account of his religious convictions. On October 12, 1945, Desmond Doss received the Medal of Honor from President Harry S. Truman. This medal is the highest award for valor in action against an enemy force. By helping to support and maintain the war, Desmond was the first non-combatant to receive the Medal of Honor. A dramatized account of Doss's life and war experience, as well as testimony from his peers, is portrayed in Mel Gibson's 2016 film Hacksaw Ridge, starring Andrew Garfield as Doss. Other conscientious objectors who have been awarded the Medal of Honor are Thomas W. Bennett and Joseph G. LaPointe, both medics who served during the Vietnam War. Both Bennett and LaPointe were killed in combat within four months of each other in 1969 and were awarded their medals posthumously. Selective conscientious objection \\"The individual's objections must be to all wars rather than a specific war.\\" Objection to participation in a specific war is called selective conscientious objection, which the United States does not recognize. A conscientious objector may still be willing to participate \\"in a theocratic or spiritual war between the powers of good and evil\\". Conscientious objection in the Selective Service System During a draft, the Selective Service System assigns classifications to draftees. A person classified as 1-A is considered available for military service. Conscientious objectors available for noncombatant military service are classified as 1-A-O, while those who oppose all military service are classified as 1-O and available for civilian work. =Alternative service= During a draft, as part of the Alternative Service Program, the Selective Service System will consider 1-O (civilian) conscientious objectors to be Alternative Service Workers (ASWs), required to work for members of the Alternative Service Employer Network (ASEN). Conscientious objection in the United States military The Department of Defense also implements the classification of conscientious objectors into its own system. The Navy, the Marine Corps, the Army, the Air Force, and the Coast Guard each provide their own policies on conscientious objection. =Application within the military= When the draft is not in effect, only those who have enlisted themselves can apply for or receive formal conscientious objector status. Such a person is only eligible for classification as a conscientious objector only if their beliefs are determined to have \\"crystallized\\" after receipt of an induction notice. The Selective Service System does not accept requests for classification as a conscientious objector when the draft is not in effect. If the draft is reinstated, a draftee will have a short period of time after enlistment to request classification as a conscientious objector. A person who is already enlisted can file for classification as a 1-A-O conscientious objector to be assigned to two years of noncombatant service or civilian work \\"contributing to the maintenance of the national health, safety, or interest\\". =Noncombatant service= Noncombatant service is any military service that is unarmed at all times and does not require weapons training. Service aboard an armed ship or aircraft or in a combat zone is considered to be noncombatant unless the service requires personal and direct involvement in the operation of weapons. =Investigative process= For serving personnel of the United States military, conscientious objection applications are \\"subject to an investigative process by a senior officer not in the applicant's chain of command\\", as well as \\"an interview of the applicant by a military chaplain as well as a psychiatrist or medical officer\\". The officer conducts an informal hearing at which the sincerity of the applicant's convictions is examined. By whom the decision is made varies by military branch. =Acceptance rates= Conscientious objector applications for enlisted soldiers are reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the individual's respective branch of the military. Between 2001 and 2007, Army acceptance rates for conscientious objector applications varied. Of the few applications the Army received (between 18 and 39 per year) between 49% and 78% were accepted per year.

Both are written by author Miguel de Cervantes. It was originally published in a 1613 collection of novellas called Novelas ejemplares.  Author  Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra was born in Alcal√° de Henares, a university town near Madrid, on September 29, 1547. He was a soldier, writer of novels, poems, and plays, and an accountant and tax collector. One of the greatest authors of Spanish literature, he became internationally known for his novel, Don Quijote, the Man of la Mancha (Don Quijote de la Mancha). Cervantes wrote a series of twelve novellas which include \\"The Deceitful Marriage\\" and \\"The Dialogue of the Dogs\\". He died in Madrid on April 22, 1616. ;Exemplary Stories Exemplary Stories (Novelas ejemplares) is a series of twelve novellas that follow the model established in Italy and written by Miguel de Cervantes between 1590 and 1612. The collection was printed in Madrid in 1613 by Juan de la Cuesta, and was well received in the wake of the release of the first part of Don Quixote.  Narrative  The story is loosely tied to the previous story in the volume, \\"El casamiento enga√±oso\\" (\\"The Deceitful Marriage\\"), which is about a dishonest suitor duped out of his wealth by his conniving young bride. The experience lands the suitor in a hospital in Valladolid. Suffering from syphilis, he looks out of the hospital window and, presumably in a delirium, he sees and hears two dogs begin to speak at the stroke of midnight. One dog, Berganza, tells the other, Cipi√≥n (Scipio), about his experiences with his various human masters and opines in a highly refined manner on a slew of social and philosophical themes such as greed, Gypsies, dishonesty, honor, and witchcraft. Cipi√≥n promises to tell his own life story the following night. Cervantes leaves the reader to determine whether or not the dogs have actually been talking or if the bedridden man has imagined it.  Plot  In the story, Cervantes offers the readers, through the protagonists‚Äô (the two dogs') dialogues, his own narrative poetics. He introduces a ...story and dialogue that took place between Scipio and Berganza, who are commonly known as Mahudes's dogs and who belong to the Hospital of [the] Resurrection, which is in the city of Valladolid, outside the Campo Gate... Berganza's story begins with the description of life in a slaughter house in Seville, where he was born. He gives a lot of details about the doings of the underworld, its thieves, and its villains. Scipio adds comments and gives advice on how to narrate a story properly: If you‚Äôre going to take this long to describe the condition of the masters you‚Äôve had and the failings of their professions, [...] I want to point something out to you, and you‚Äôll see the truth of it when I relate my life story. Some stories are intrinsically appealing, others are made appealing in the way they are told. The ‚Äòcolloquium‚Äô finishes with a sentence that carries the reader back to the principal theme of the short story, \\"The Deceitful Marriage\\", the narrative principal frame, in which the circle is closed with Peralta and Ensign Campuzano becoming great admirers of the invention of \\"The Dialogue of the Dogs\\". ;Berganza's history The following is a summary of the multitude of jobs, services, and tasks that were asked by different owners of Berganza throughout his life: * The first task that Berganza exercises was in a slaughter house in Seville when his first owner, Nicholas Snub-Nose, who taught him to rush forth at the bulls. Berganza, newly renamed Barcino, had to take a basket full of food to a friend of the owner, every day. He used to deliver to a certain mistress, in the early morning, what Nicholas had stolen during the night. * The second task that he had was that of a shepherd where the only thing Berganza had to do was to take care to the sheep and to watch out for the wild animal attacks such as wolves; but since he was being punished, in addition to this work it was only possible for Berganza to sleep every now and then. * Later Berganza was working with a very rich merchant, where he had the role of a guardian behind the door, for what he was rewarded for doing it so well. Instead of guarding the door, with the children of the merchant, Berganza had a much calmer and relaxed job since he simply had to play with them, and these children were so grateful that he was living like a king. But, since he could not come to their college, because it was distracting to the other students, Berganza was sent back to his previous position: guardian behind the door. * After leaving his previous job, he started working for a corrupt police officer who actually supported a group of thugs. * A man who welcomed him, taught him to do cute tricks, graceful things that were surprising or that were making the people laugh. Thanks to what Berganza learned, his owner earned a lot of money by leading his dog to different places to put on his show. * The following owners that Berganza had were gypsies, and he had to do same kind of job as with his previous owner. * In this following job, he had to guard the garden, together with a Morisco, who was a writer, this work was easy. * The latter work was of guardian in a hospital together with Scipio, in Valladolid.  Characters  Ensign Campuzano is a protagonist in the previous short story called \\"The Deceitful Marriage\\" in which he gives graduate Peralta an incredible dialogue to read that he had written and of which he claims he was a witness. It purported events occurred when he was convalescing at the Hospital of the Resurrection (in Valladolid): Scipio and Berganza are Mahudes's dogs and possess a human skills, such as speech and reasoning, which allows them to judge and criticize from afar. They are static prominent characters, since these two don't change attitude and they lead the tone of the conversation during the entire story. Berganza, thanks to a sudden ability to speak, tells his life-story to Scipio, another dog who gives his advice on how Berganza should narrate his own story.  Themes  * Scipio helps Berganza by giving him some advice on the way he uses storytelling. * Berganza exposes the evilness and the corruption of the society. ;How men perceived the dogs Since the dogs are a symbol of friendship and inviolable loyalty, when their owners die the dogs feel their death; many of these dogs stop eating and do not to separate themselves from their owners' graves. But, with Berganza's life story, the dichotomy of preconceived ideas of friendship and loyalty fade away; the readers get the truth within the underpinnings of owner‚Äîdog relationships.  Miguel Cervantes analysis  Imaginative prose fiction at the time was viewed with great suspicion in certain quarters. Cervantes's own Don Quixote explores and parodies the idea that literature not grounded in empirical reality is dangerous stuff in \\"The Deceitful Marriage\\". In \\"The Dialogue of the Dogs\\", Cervantes is most overtly concerned with a reader's suspension of disbelief. He playfully places a quasi-picaresque autobiography, the most 'realist' fiction of its time in its baring of society's vices, in a totally fantastic framework of rational, talking dogs. He then defies us, like Peralta, not to get caught up in it. Like so many other stories, it is modeled on a variety of sources: the Lucianic dialogue, Aesop's fables, and of course, the pseudo-autobiography, a satirical form in its own right which Cervantes takes the opportunity to satirize further. [...] It is a picaresque narrative with its own in-built critique - a story about the creative process and how to cast a critical eye over the expanding text; Scipio is forever interrupting Berganza's story to question where it is leading; or to comment on repeated digression; or its tendency to moralize. It is also about the process of reading and the power of imagination. The witch at the center of the story claims that during the Sabbath orgies it is impossible to ascertain whether the experience is real or fantasy. The analogy is clear. If the fantasy is powerful enough we can find ourselves believing that dogs are capable of rational speech and worry about the satirical nature of their words.  Influence and adaptations  Cervantes' novellas inspired several English Jacobean dramas. Plays based on the novellas include Beaumont and Fletcher's Love's Pilgrimage (adapted from \\"Las dos doncellas\\" or The Two Damsels); Fletcher's The Chances Google Books (\\"La se√±ora Cornelia\\" or The Lady Cornelia); Fletcher's Rule a Wife and Have a Wife (El casamiento enga√±oso or The Deceitful Marriage), among others. Sigmund Freud was interested in the story and identified with Cipi√≥n.

He was ordained a priest in 1906 and earned Ph.D. in psychology in 1912. He returned to Lithuania and became a priest in the Church of St. Johns, Vilnius. He joined Lithuanian cultural life, becoming the first chairman of the Lithuanian Education Society Rytas which established and maintained Lithuanian-language one-room schools. His attempt at holding Lithuanian-language service at the Church of St. Johns caused Polish protests and he was reassigned to the Dominican Church of the Holy Spirit and later to Semeli≈°kƒós. During World War I, he served as a military chaplain in the Caucasus Campaign. After returning to Lithuania, he joined the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party and was elected four times to the Seimas (parliament) from 1920 to the December 1926 coup d'√©tat that brought the regime of Antanas Smetona. He retired from politics and became a school director in Zarasai and a teacher in Utena. In mid-1944, Steponaviƒçius was one of the organizers of the Fatherland Defense Force, a short-lived military unit formed to combat approaching Soviet forces. He retreated to Germany where he died in 1947. Biography =Education= Steponaviƒçius was born in , near Antalieptƒó, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire, to a family of petty landed nobles. He received his first education at home and in 1890 was admitted to the Russian-language . In 1896, he transferred to the Riga State Gymnasium but left it without completing the sixth grade in 1899. He continued his education at the Vilnius Priest Seminary and the Saint Petersburg Roman Catholic Theological Academy. He was ordained a priest in 1906 and in 1907 defended his dissertation on Immanuel Kant to receive master's degree. He studied further in Germany at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, University of Berlin, and University of Leipzig. In Leipzig, he studied under professor Wilhelm Wundt and defended his Ph.D. thesis on subjective equality in 1912. =In Vilnius 1913‚Äì1914= After studies, Steponaviƒçius returned to Lithuania and was appointed as priest to the Church of St. Johns, Vilnius. He supported and promoted Lithuanian language and culture in contrast with widespread Polonization. In January 1913, he was elected as the first chairman of the Lithuanian Education Society Rytas. The society sought to establish Lithuanian-language schools, courses, reading rooms, and other educational institutions in the Vilnius Region. It was successful in establishing numerous local chapters and one-room schools. In May 1913, he was assigned as religion teacher to the private gymnasium of Mikhail Pavlovsky. In June, he was elected to the board of the Lithuanian Scientific Society and presented a paper on experimental psychology. He also joined the Lithuanian Art Society and contributed articles to Lithuanian press (Draugija, Viltis). At his church, in May 1913, Steponaviƒçius wanted to launch a series of Lithuanian-language church services for the May devotions to the Blessed Virgin Mary. They were to be held at 6 a.m. so that Lithuanian servants could pray before work. Due to loud protests and interruptions by Polish residents, the service was held only twice. The episode reached , administrator of Vilnius Diocese, and Piotr Veryovkin (–ü—ë—Ç—Ä –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∏—á –í–µ—Ä—ë–≤–∫–∏–Ω), governor of Vilnius. The issue was widely discussed in the Lithuanian and Polish press and was raised by in the State Duma. It was referenced by Viltis as one of key moments when dual Polish-Lithuanian identity split into just Polish or just Lithuanian identity. Steponaviƒçius was given a two-month vacation and then reassigned to the Dominican Church of the Holy Spirit. =Political work= In June 1914, he was appointed as dean to Semeli≈°kƒós, a town about west of Vilnius. The reasons for the assignment are not clear ‚Äì there is some evidence that Steponaviƒçius requested the transfer due to poor health, but it also could have been a retribution for his Lithuanian activities. In May 1915, during World War I, he was drafted to the Imperial Russian Army as a military chaplain and was sent to the Caucasus Campaign. Stationed in Tbilisi, he joined Lithuanian activities and managed to establish regular Lithuanian-language services in one of the Armenian churches. Sometime between 1916 and 1918, he returned to Semeli≈°kƒós. In 1920, during the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian War, he organized a 50-men partisan group to fight the Polish forces. He was arrested by the Poles and transported to Hrodna. Upon his release, Steponaviƒçius became interested in politics. A member of the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party since 1919, he actively campaigned in the April 1920 elections to the Constituent Assembly of Lithuania. Due to his imprisonment in Hrodna, he became a member of the assembly only on 4 February 1921. He was elected to the succeeding First, Second, and Third Seimas of Lithuania. In the Seimas, Steponaviƒçius was a member of various parliamentary committees, including Finance and Budget (November 1922 ‚Äì December 1926), National Defense (November 1922 ‚Äì December 1926 with a break in June‚ÄìJuly 1923), and Foreign Affairs (October 1924 ‚Äì December 1926). In the Third Seimas, he was also the second deputy speaker. =Pedagogical work= After the December 1926 coup d'√©tat brought the regime of Antanas Smetona, Steponaviƒçius retired from politics and devoted his time to teaching. He became the principal of the effective September 1927. During his tenure, Steponaviƒçius oversaw construction of the new modern school building and transformation of the school from a regular 4-year secondary school to an 8-year higher school of commerce. In December 1928, he established Zarasai chapter of the Motiejus Valanƒçius folk high school () and funded it from his own savings. He taught German language at the public high school and psychology at the folk high school. In 1928‚Äì1930, he was the priest serving village located about east from Zarasai. He was also the chairman of the Zarasai chapter of the Lithuanian Riflemen's Union and organized construction of the new chapter headquarters. In recognition for his services, he was awarded the Order of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Gediminas in the Third Degree in 1931. In 1930, the Catholic youth organization Ateitis was banned by the Smetona's regime. A group of students secretly continued Ateitis activities and were questioned by the police. Steponaviƒçius defended his students and was tried for insulting a deputy prosecutor. In June 1934, he was sentenced to four months in prison. The sentence was removed on appeal, but Steponaviƒçius was demoted to a teacher and transferred to the . Freed from administrative work and other various activities, Steponaviƒçius returned to psychology and became interested in parapsychology. He published two volumes of his essays in 1937 and 1938. The publication of the third volume was interrupted by World War II. =World War II= During the German occupation of Lithuania during World War II, Steponaviƒçius sympathized with the German regime. He briefly served as the burgomaster of Utena before returning to Zarasai where he worked as a teacher from September 1942 to May 1943. In early 1943, he was appointed as governor of the Zarasai district of the Reichskommissariat Ostland. In this capacity, he participated in the All Lithuanian Conference of 5 April 1943. The conference, called by Petras Kubili≈´nas, adopted a resolution encouraging Lithuanians to cooperate with the Germans and their efforts of raising a Lithuanian Waffen-SS legion. Steponaviƒçius supported the Lithuanian Freedom Army which was preparing for an armed fight against the Red Army. On 7 July 1944, Steponaviƒçius with a group of armed men left Zarasai towards Samogitia. The group stopped near the village where Lithuanians decided to organize the Fatherland Defense Force. Steponaviƒçius was a vocal supporter of organizing the unit and joining the Wehrmacht and opposed calls for guerrilla warfare. He was elected political advisor to the unit and helped establishing contacts with Hellmuth M√§der, officer in the 9th Army who promised weapons and uniforms. The unit suffered losses near Seda on 7 October 1944 and disintegrated soon after. Many of the men, including Steponaviƒçius, retreated to Germany. He later compiled a list of men who fought and were killed near Seda. He worked in a textile factory in Krnov (J√§gerndorf), and as a farm hand and metal-worker near Wangen im Allg√§u. After a brief illness, he died in Wangen im Allg√§u on 8 December 1947 and was buried in the Saint Wolfgang Cemetery.

He played college volleyball for the UCLA Bruins under head coach Al Scates. His college teams won national championships in 1972 and 1974. He is best known for beach volleyball, where he was the game's most dominant player from the mid 1970s through the early 1980s. Early life and college career Menges grew up in Santa Monica, California. He was a standout athlete at Santa Monica High School. Out of high school he was awarded a scholarship to play volleyball for Al Scates at UCLA. Menges played outside hitter and setter in Scates' 6-2 offense, and by his sophomore year in 1972 he had earned a spot in the starting rotation. The two time defending national champion Bruins of 1972 were not considered college volleyball's best men's team. The two teams favored to win the national championship were the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos and the Aztecs of San Diego State. The Bruins earned an at-large bid and traveled to Muncie, Indiana for the 1972 national tournament held at Ball State University. The format of the tournament at the time consisted of a four-team preliminary round robin to determine seeding into a subsequent single-elimination championship bracket. The Bruins played well early in round robin play until they were badly beaten by the Aztecs of San Diego State, 15-7, 15-11. UCLA, UC Santa Barbara and UCSD all ended up with 2 - 1 records, but the Bruins were given the top position in the playoff seeding on the basis of points differential. In their semi-final they easily defeated Ball State, while UCSD defeated UC Santa Barbara in the other semi-final to set up a championship final between the Bruins and San Diego State. SDSU took the first two games, and with an 8-3 lead in the third appeared ready for a three game sweep. The Bruins rallied, however, to win in an upset, 10-15, 9-15, 15-9, 15-10, 15-7. UCLA finished the season with a 27-7 record and their third consecutive national crown. In 1973 Menges and the Bruins finished 4th in the 18-team Southern California Intercollegiate Volleyball Association (SCIVA). UCLA met San Diego State at the regional finals in Pauley Pavilion in a rematch of the 1972 national championship match. UCLA went up 2-0 before a three game comeback by the Aztecs eliminated the Bruins from the tournament. Said the Aztec's Chris Marlowe: ‚ÄúWhen we came back and beat UCLA in Pauley, it was like it was willed to be. It was like God came down from the mountain and was rooting for the Aztecs.‚Äù San Diego State went on to win the 1973 national championship. The Bruins finished the season 21-8. 1974 saw Menges and the Bruins finish 3rd in the SCIVA, behind UCSB and Southern Cal. The 1974 NCAA Men's Volleyball Tournament was held on the UC Santa Barbara campus, and UC Santa Barbara was the heavy favorite to win it. UCLA made it to the NCAA tournament by upsetting Southern Cal in their district playoffs. The previous final four tournament format of round robin play for seeding followed by a single-elimination playoff was dropped in 1974 in favor of going directly to a single-elimination playoff. The tournament field remained limited to four teams. In the semi-finals UCLA defeated Ball State in straight sets while UCSB defeated Springfield in straight sets. The championship match was a back and forth affair, with UCSB beating the Bruins in Games 1 and 3, while UCLA took games 2 and 4. Many of the Bruin kills were coming from an inside attack, with UCLA's Bob Leonard receiving fast tempo sets from Menges. In the game five clincher the Gauchos led 6-1 before the Bruins rallied with six straight points to lead 7-6. UCLA kept just enough momentum to take the championship: 10-15, 15-8, 10-15, 15-11, 15-12. Menges and Mike Normand were named to the All-Tournament team. UCLA ended the season 30-5. It was the fourth championship in five years for the Bruins. Menges earned All-American honors in his senior year at UCLA. Beach career Menges started playing beach volleyball on Santa Monica's Sorrento Beach at the age of 17. He commonly played with and against Tom Chamales, who had graduated a year before him from Santa Monica High, and Randy Niles. Initially they played Santa Monica's \\"outside courts\\" before being invited up to play the \\"first court\\". It was at Santa Monica in 1972 that Menges met longtime partner Greg Lee. Menges' first Open tournament victory was with Lee at the 1973 Marine Open. They were partners off and on for the next two seasons while each completed an athletic career at UCLA. Menges played volleyball for Al Scates while Lee played basketball as a guard for John Wooden during the Bill Walton era. On the 1974 beach volleyball circuit Menges advanced to the finals of 4 events, winning 2 times, once with Chamales and once with Ron Von Hagen. In 1975 Menges and Lee began playing full-time together, and the two went on a tear. They reached the finals of 10 events, winning all but one. In the mid-1970s, the beach volleyball tour consisted of 12 tournaments played up and down the southern California coast, from San Diego in the south to Santa Cruz in the north. Menges and Lee dominated the events, winning the final seven matches of the 1975 season and the first six in 1976 to string together 13 tournament wins in a row. Conditioning and determination were a big part of the success they found. Said Menges: \\"In those days, teams in the winners' bracket played best- of-three matches to 11 points; losers'-bracket matches were best of three to 15 points.\\" Some matches lasted as long as three hours. \\"It was more of an endurance game back then. You had to be in great shape.\\" In the mid to late 1970s the team of Menges and Lee was the most dominant pairing on the beach volleyball scene. Their record of 13 Open wins in a row stood for 16 years until tied by the pair of Karch Kiraly and Kent Steffes. They made the finals in all 28 volleyball tournaments they entered together, and won 25 of them. The first pro beach volleyball World Championship was won by Menges and Lee in 1976. The 25 tournament wins by Menges and Lee places the pair at #6 on the all-time list of wins for a team. Partner changes are common in Pro Beach Volleyball, and Menges played with many of the game's top players. Besides Ron Von Hagen and Greg Lee mentioned above, Menges partnered extensively in 1977 with Chris Marlow, and later with Matt Gage. Menges won his second Manhattan with Marlowe in 1977. In all he won six tournaments that year with Marlow, with the pair finishing off the year in September with a World Championship win, the second for Menges. Menges and Gage teamed-up 11 times in 1979, reaching he finals 8 times and winning 4 of them. Counting all years Menges and Gage entered 17 events together, winning 8 of them. Said Gage: ‚ÄúMenges and Von Hagen were my two strongest partners. I was comfortable with either one of those guys, and we had the same philosophy about siding out to wear down opponents.‚Äù Menges was a part of the early success of such players as Sinjin Smith, who won his first Manhattan Open teaming with Menges in 1979, and Randy Stoklos, who won his first Manhattan Open with Menges in 1981. At the time of the 1981 Manhattan Open Stoklos was a 20 year old just out of UCLA, while Menges was a beach veteran of 31. Menges also won tournaments pairing with Tom Chamales, Gary Hooper and Jon Stevenson. Menges offered that with all said and done, Greg Lee was his favorite partner. On the 1980 beach volleyball circuit, Menges advanced to the finals of 8 events, winning 3 times. In 1981 and 1982, he reached 6 finals, winning 4 times, including his last championship win at the 1982 Mission Beach Open. He retired in 1983, but came out of retirement in 1991 at the age of 40 to compete in the AVP Beach circuit. He played in 15 more tournaments before retiring again. All told during his 13 year career Menges entered 75 Open tournaments, advancing to the finals 62 times, and winning 48 events. The Manhattan Beach Open, the oldest and most prestigious pro beach event, was considered the premier event in the 1970s. Menges won the Manhattan five times, winning titles in 1975 and 1978 with Greg Lee, in 1977 with Chris Marlowe, in 1979 with Sinjin Smith and in 1981 with Randy Stoklos. Menges was considered king of the beach in the mid to late 1970s. He and Lee were the subject of numerous articles on beach volleyball, and the image of a bandana clad Jim Menges digging up a volleyball made the cover of Volleyball Magazine. Following a loss that stopped Kiraly and Steffes from breaking the tour record of 13 tournament championships in a row set in 1975-76 by Menges and Lee, Kiraly said: \\"I guess it's appropriate that Menges and Lee stay in the record book. They laid the foundation for the sport.\\" Post beach career Following his playing days Menges entered the real estate field in Orange County. During the late 1990s and 2000s he became involved in coaching beach volleyball players and helped Jose Loiola and Emanuel Rego become the first team to qualify for the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Menges has also served as Tournament Director for the AVP Tour. Menges was inducted into the CBVA Beach Volleyball Hall of Fame in 1994. Player profile During Menges' years of prominence the side-out scoring system of the day resulted in much longer matches. To score points you had to prevent the opposing team from siding out. It was consistency that won matches, and Menges was relentless in his focus and consistency. Like Lang and Von Hagen before him, and Smith and Stoklos after, Menges would defeat teams with a concentration and intensity that never faltered throughout two and three hour contests. Smaller than Lee, he would invariably get served and have control of their side out game. If teams altered their tactic and served Lee, Menges would set perfectly and play an intense, ball hawking defense. He would wear down his opponents, placing a relentless pressure on them to avoid making mistakes in long side-out battles, while not allowing himself or his partners to make errors when it was their turn to receive serve. He was the games best setter and an outstanding digger. Menges prepared for tournaments just by playing the game, and he played game after game, spending all day at the beach every day. Menges played for the fun of it and for the challenge of trying to prove himself. Said Menges, what he enjoyed most was... \\"the competition and being outside at the beach getting great exercise. I enjoyed playing tournaments to compete with others and to see who was the best\\". Menges excelled at the mental and physical skills of two man beach volleyball, and these enabled him to dominate the game and define an era of the sport. As top accomplishments in beach volleyball, Menges lists: \\"First winning the first World Championship at Santa Monica's State Beach with Greg Lee in 1975. Second was winning those five Manhattan Beach Opens. That's something I'm proud of because everyone wanted to win the Manhattan. Third was my first Open win at the Marine Open with Greg Lee in 1973, beating Ron Lang and Ron Von Hagen in the finals. Fourth was winning the Hermosa Beach Open with Matt Gage in 1980.\\" References ;Citations Further reading * Couvillon, Arthur R.

Scottish Gaelic ( ), is a Celtic language native to Scotland. A member of the Goidelic branch of the Celtic languages, Scottish Gaelic, like Modern Irish and Manx, developed out of Middle Irish. Most of modern Scotland was once Gaelic-speaking, as evidenced especially by Gaelic-language placenames. Origins to zenith thumbrightLinguistic division in early 12th century Scotland. The traditional view is that Gaelic was brought to Scotland, probably in the 4th-5th centuries, by settlers from Ireland who founded the Gaelic kingdom of D√°l Riata on Scotland's west coast in present- day Argyll. This view is based mostly on early medieval writings such as the 7th century Irish _Senchus fer n-Alban_ or the 8th century Anglo-Saxon _Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum_. However, the lack of archaeological or place name evidence for a migration or invasion has caused this traditional view to fall out of favor. Today most archaeologists and historians believe that Gaelic in D√°l Riata developed among the native population out of the common Proto-Celtic language of the British Isles. Close sea communications with Ireland and the substantial land barrier of the Scottish Highlands to the east contributed to Proto-Celtic in D√°l Riata developing into Gaelic rather than into Pictish or Cumbric as it did east and south of the Highlands. Gaelic in Scotland was mostly confined to until the 8th century, when it began expanding into Pictish areas north of the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde. This was spurred by the intermarriage of Gaelic and Pictish aristocratic families, the political merger of the two kingdoms in the early 9th century, and the common threat of attack by Norse invaders. By 900, Pictish appears to have become extinct, completely replaced by Gaelic.Clarkson, pp. 238‚Äì244 An exception might be made for the Northern Isles, however, where Pictish was more likely supplanted by Norse rather than by Gaelic. During the reign of (900‚Äì943), outsiders began to refer to the region as the kingdom of Alba rather than as the kingdom of the Picts, but we do not know whether this was because a new kingdom was established or because \\"Alba\\" was simply a closer approximation of the Pictish name for the Picts. However, though the Pictish language did not disappear suddenly, a process of Gaelicisation (which may have begun generations earlier) was clearly under way during the reigns of and his successors. By a certain point, probably during the 11th century, all the inhabitants of Alba had become fully Gaelicised Scots, and Pictish identity was forgotten.Broun, \\"Dunkeld\\", Broun, \\"National Identity\\", Forsyth, \\"Scotland to 1100\\", pp. 28‚Äì32, Woolf, \\"Constantine II\\"; cf. Bannerman, \\"Scottish Takeover\\", passim, representing the \\"traditional\\" view. By the 10th century, Gaelic had become the dominant language throughout northern and western Scotland, the Gaelo-Pictic Kingdom of Alba. Its spread to southern Scotland was less even and less complete. Place name analysis suggests dense usage of Gaelic in Galloway and adjoining areas to the north and west, as well as in West Lothian and parts of western Midlothian. Less dense usage is suggested for north Ayrshire, Renfrewshire, the Clyde Valley and eastern Dumfriesshire. This latter region is roughly the area of the old Kingdom of Strathclyde, which was annexed by the Kingdom of Alba in the early 11th century, but its inhabitants may have continued to speak Cumbric as late as the 12th century. In south-eastern Scotland, there is no evidence that Gaelic was ever widely spoken: the area shifted from Cumbric to Old English during its long incorporation into the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Northumbria. After the Lothians were conquered by Malcolm II at the Battle of Carham in 1018, the elites spoke Gaelic and continued to do so until about 1200. However commoners retained Old English. With the incorporation of Strathclyde and the Lothians, Gaelic reached its social, cultural, political, and geographic zenith in Scotland. The language in Scotland had been developing independently of the language in Ireland at least as early as its crossing the (\\"Spine\\" or \\"ridge of Britain\\", its location is not known) into Pictland.

He is being greeted by the ', the royal poet, who is addressing him with the proclamation \\"Benach De Re Albanne\\" (= ', \\"God's Blessing on the King of Scotland\\"); the poet goes on to recite Alexander's genealogy. Many historians mark the reign of King Malcom Canmore (Malcolm III) as the beginning of Gaelic's eclipse in Scotland.Withers, p. 19 In either 1068 or 1070, the king married the exiled Princess Margaret of Wessex. This future Saint Margaret of Scotland was a member of the royal House of Wessex which had occupied the English throne from its founding until the Norman Conquest. Margaret was thoroughly Anglo-Saxon and is often credited (or blamed) for taking the first significant steps in anglicizing the Scottish court. She spoke no Gaelic, gave her children Anglo-Saxon rather than Gaelic names, and brought many English bishops, priests, and monastics to Scotland. Her family also served as a conduit for the entry of English nobles into Scotland.Withers, p. 19 When both Malcolm and Margaret died just days apart in 1093, the Gaelic aristocracy rejected their anglicized sons and instead backed Malcolm's brother Donald as the next King of Scots. Known as Donald B√†n (‚Äúthe Fair‚Äù), the new king had lived 17 years in Ireland as a young man and his power base as an adult was in the thoroughly Gaelic west of Scotland. Upon Donald's ascension to the throne, in the words of the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ , ‚Äúthe Scots drove out all the English who had been with King Malcolm‚Äù.Magnusson, p. 68 Malcolm's sons fled to the English court, but in 1097 returned with an Anglo-Norman army backing them. Donald was overthrown, blinded, and imprisoned for the remaining two years of his life. Because of the strong English ties of Malcolm's sons Edgar, Alexander, and David ‚Äì each of whom became king in turn ‚Äì Donald B√†n is sometimes called the ‚Äòlast Celtic King of Scotland‚Äô.MacArthur, Margaret (1874). History of Scotland. New York: Henry Holt and Company. p. 33. He was last Scottish monarch to be buried on Iona, the one-time center of the Scottish Gaelic Church and the traditional burial place of the Gaelic Kings of D√†l Riada and the Kingdom of Alba. During the reigns of the sons of Malcolm Canmore (1097-1153), Anglo-Norman names and practices spread throughout Scotland south of the Forth-Clyde line and along the northeastern coastal plain as far north as Moray. Norman French became dominant among the new feudal aristocracy, especially in southern Scotland, and completely displaced Gaelic at court. The establishment of royal burghs throughout the same area, particularly under David I, attracted large numbers of foreigners speaking ‚ÄòInglis‚Äô, the language of the merchant class. This was the beginning of Gaelic's status as a predominantly rural language in Scotland.Withers, pp. 19-23 The country experienced significant population growth in the 1100s and 1200s in the expanding burghs and their nearby agricultural districts.Whyte, p. 57 These economic developments helped spread English as well. Gaelic still retained some of its old prestige in medieval Scotland. At the coronation of King Alexander III in 1249, a traditional _seanchaidh_ or story-teller recited the king's full genealogy in Gaelic all the way back to Fergus M√≤r, the mythical progenitor of the Scots in D√°l Riata, ‚Äúin accordance with the custom which had grown up in the kingdom from antiquity right up to that time‚Äù.Walter Bower, Scotichronicon; http://digital.nls.uk/scotlandspages/timeline/1249.html Clan chiefs in the northern and western parts of Scotland continued to support Gaelic bards who remained a central feature of court life there. The semi-independent Lordship of the Isles in the Hebrides and western coastal mainland remained thoroughly Gaelic since the language's recovery there in the 12th century, providing a political foundation for cultural prestige down to the end of the 15th century. √ì Baoill, p. 553-6 That being said, it seems clear that Gaelic had ceased to be the language of Scotland by 1400 at the latest. It disappeared from the central lowlands by c1350 and from the eastern coastal lowlands north of the Mounth not long afterwards. By the mid-1300s English in its Scottish form ‚Äì what eventually came to be called Scots -- emerged as the official language of government and law.Withers, 1988, p. 139 Scotland's emergent nationalism in the era following the conclusion of the Wars of Scottish Independence was organized around and through Scots as well. For example, the nation's great patriotic literature including John Barbour's _The Brus_ (1375) and Blind Harry's _The Wallace_ (bef. 1488) was written in Scots, not Gaelic. It was around this time that the very name of Gaelic began to change. Down through the 14th century, Gaelic was referred to in English as _Scottis_ , i.e. the language of the Scots. By the end of the 15th century, however, the Scottish dialect of Northern English had absorbed that designation. English/Scots speakers referred to Gaelic instead as _Yrisch_ or _Erse_ , i.e. Irish.Withers, pp. 19-23 King James IV (d. 1513) thought Gaelic important enough to learn and speak. However, he was the last Scottish monarch to do so. Persecution, Retreat, and Dispersal The historian Charles Withers argues that the geographic retreat of Gaelic in Scotland is the context for the establishment of the country's signature divide between the ‚ÄòLowlands‚Äô and the ‚ÄòHighlands‚Äô. Before the late 1300s, there is no evidence that anyone thought of Scotland as divided into two geographic parts. From the 1380s onward, however, the country was increasingly understood to be the union of two distinct spaces and peoples: one inhabiting the low-lying south and the eastern seaboard speaking English/Scots; another inhabiting the mountainous north and west as well as the islands speaking Gaelic.Withers, 1984, pp. 22-27 What Gaelic remained in the Lowlands in the sixteenth century had disappeared completely by the eighteenth. Gaelic vanished from Fife by 1600, eastern Caithness by 1650, and Galloway by 1700.Withers, pp. 39-41, 63 At the same time the Scottish crown entered a determined period of state-building in which cultural, religious, and linguistic unity was of the highest value. As Lowland Scots sought increasingly to ‚Äòcivilize‚Äô their Highland brethren, Gaelic became an object of particular persecution. Combined with larger economic and social changes, Gaelic began a long and nearly terminal retreat. The Scottish crown forced the forfeiture of all the lands held under the Lordship of the Isles in 1493 and thereby eliminated the core Gaelic region of medieval Scotland as a political entity. Rather than solve the problems of endemic violence and resistance to Lowland rule, the destruction of the Lordship tended to exacerbate them. While Scottish kings had sought to fully integrate the west and the islands into the rest of Scotland since taking formal control of the area from the King of Norway in 1266, the policy culminated with James VI. He began an on-again off-again policy of pacification and ‚Äòcivilization‚Äô of the Highlands upon taking effective personal rule of his kingdom in 1583. This especially meant establishing the clear rule of royal writ and the suppression of all independent-minded local clan leaders. As a precursor to the Plantation of Ulster, James and the Scottish Parliament even planted hundreds of Lowland Scots settlers from Fife on the Isle of Lewis in the late 1590s and again in the first decade of the 1600s.Alison Cathcart, ‚ÄúThe Statutes of Iona: The archipelagic context,‚Äù Journal of British Studies 49 (2010), 4-27 Many point to the Statutes of Iona as the beginning of official government persecution of Gaelic in Scotland.Donald Gregory, The History of the Western Highlands and Islands of Scotland, from A.D. 1493 to A.D. 1625; Martin MacGregor, ‚ÄúThe Statues of Iona: Text and context,‚Äù Innes Review 57 (2006). In 1609 James VI/I through his agent Andrew Knox, Bishop of the Isles, successfully negotiated a series of texts with nine prominent Gaelic chiefs on the ancient island of Iona. The provisions sought to enlist the chiefs themselves in undermining the traditional Gaelic political order including an end to traditional Gaelic ‚Äòguesting and feasting‚Äô, limitations on the size of chiefs‚Äô retinues, and a ban on bands of traveling bards. From the point of view of the Gaelic language, the most notable statute was the one which compelled the chiefs the send their eldest child to schools in the Lowlands so as to ensure the next generation of Highland elites ‚Äúmay be found able sufficiently to speik, reid and wryte Englische‚Äù.MacKinnon, 1991: 46. The historian Julian Goodare downplays the importance of the Statues of Iona in favor of seeing them as part of a much larger set of regulations which the crown sought to promulgate for the reorganization of Gaelic society.Julian Goodare, ‚ÄúThe Statutes of Iona in context,‚Äù Scottish Historical Review 77 (1998), 31-57 He stresses the greater importance of a 1616 Act of the Privy Council of Scotland which declared that no heir of a Gaelic chief could inherit unless he could write, read, and speak English. Another 1616 act of the Privy Council commanded the establishment of at least one English language school in every parish in Scotland so that ‚Äúthe Irish language, which is one of the chief and principal causes of the continuance of barbarity and incivility among the inhabitants of the Isles and Highlands may be abolished and removed‚Äù. Withers claims that by the mid-1700s all Highland gentry were bilingual.Withers, p. 68 While these policies had no effect on the Gaelic-speaking masses, they did aid the integration of the Gaelic elite into the British polity and English-speaking society. Economic and educational developments seriously diminished Gaelic in Scotland over the course of the 17th and 18th centuries. English penetrated the Highlands and Isles particularly through commerce and sheep-ranching. Highland burghs such as Inverness and Fort William were outposts of English in the region, becoming only more so following the Jacobite rising of 1745. As English-speakers held all economic power outside the Highlands and most of it within the Gaidhealtachd, Gaelic monolingualism was fast becoming an economic hindrance. Men tended to learn English before women and children, and Gaels tended to use English for economic transactions even if they weren't fluent in it. Particularly on the fringes of the Highlands, English words and accents began to ‚Äòcorrupt‚Äô Gaelic speech in the 1700s, and by 1800 residents of most ‚Äòouter Gaidhealtachd‚Äô parishes could understand and use English in everyday life even if Gaelic remained their native tongue.Withers, pp. 68, 75, 98, 104-7 Education policy was much more intentional in undermining Gaelic in Scotland. Before the late 1600s, schools for the middle class, not to mention poor crofters, did not exist in the Highlands and Isles. Gaelic culture was largely non-literate at the time and thus Gaels themselves were unable to provide a modern education to their children even if they had wanted to do so. Moreover, Lowland elites had long considered Gaelic to be among the chief impediments to Scottish national unity and to the spread of ‚Äòcivilization‚Äô throughout the country, especially literacy and Protestantism. Thus Lowland Scots began establishing the first schools in Argyll in the late 1600s and in northern Scotland in the 1700s, all of them being strictly in the English language. The Society in Scotland for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SSPCK) was the most important early organization to set up schools in the Gaidhealtachd. From the SSPCK's perspective, the primary purpose of education was cultural ‚Äì to learn the Bible, to learn the catechism of the Church of Scotland, and to learn English. Even though many pupils came to school with no ability to communicate in English, SSPCK schools were strictly English-only throughout the eighteenth century. Not only was Gaelic forbidden in school. After 1751 SSPCK schools even banned the use of Gaelic in the schoolyard. The Church of Scotland also established parochial schools in the Gaidhealtachd in the 1700s and likewise banned the use of Gaelic except in translating. Gaelic- speaking pupils were not taught their own language in school until the early 1800s, first by schools operated by the Gaelic Society and later in SSPCK and parochial schools. For the latter two organizations, however, Gaelic was only introduced to provide a better stepping stone to English. Gaelic Society school numbers peaked around 1825 but had basically disappeared by the 1860s. A report of the Secretary of State in 1871 sums up the prevailing view of the period: ‚ÄúThe Gaelic language ‚Ä¶ decidedly stands in the way of the civilization of the natives making use of it‚Äù. In 1872 Scotland moved for the first time to a compulsory, state-directed, and state-funded system of education covering the entire country. Even then no provision of any kind was made for Gaelic.Withers, pp. 115-173 Economic dislocation of Gaels beginning in the early 1700s began to change the geography of Gaelic. As Gaelic migrants left the Highlands and Isles first for the major cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, later for the secondary cities of Aberdeen, Dundee, Greenock, and Perth, they temporarily returned Gaelic to the Lowlands. In the late 1700s Gaelic chapels began to be founded in Lowland cities suggesting a critical mass of Gaelic- speakers had been reached by then. The first such Gaelic chapel was established in Edinburgh in 1769. By the late 1800s Glasgow alone had ten Gaelic chapels and was clearly the urban centre of Lowland Gaelic.Withers, pp. 198-202 In this same period Gaelic became a global language. The first Gaelic- speaking migrants arrived in North America in 1770, settling originally on Prince Edward Island and later on mainland Nova Scotia and the Mohawk Valley of New York. After the American Revolution, most of the Gaels of New York moved to Glengarry County, Ontario where they joined other Highland emigrants in their new settlement. The first Gaelic-speaking settlers directly from Scotland arrived on Cape Breton in 1802. A huge wave of Gaelic immigration to Nova Scotia took place between 1815 and 1840, so large that by the mid-19th century Gaelic was the third most common language in Canada after English and French. It is estimated that there were 50,000 Gaelic speakers in Nova Scotia in 1901, more than one-sixth of all Gaelic-speakers in the world at the time.Nilsen, ‚ÄúA‚Äô Ghaidhlig an Canada‚Äù Gaels also emigrated to North Carolina in the 1700s and Gaelic was regularly spoken there down to the American Civil War.Withers, p. 109 Despite the dispersal of Gaelic to North America (and to Australasia), the 17th through 19th centuries witnessed a tremendous erosion of Gaelic. The first reliable statistics on the prevalence of Gaelic in Scotland begin in the 1690s. At that time around 25-30% of the country spoke Gaelic.Withers, p. 53 By the time the first Census of Scotland asked the population about its ability to speak Gaelic in 1881, that figure had been whittled down to merely 6%. Modern era Scottish Gaelic has a rich oral (') and written tradition, having been the language of the bardic culture of the Highland clans for many years. The language preserves knowledge of and adherence to pre-feudal 'tribal' laws and customs (as represented, for example, by the expressions ' and '). These attitudes were still evident in the complaints and claims of the Highland Land League of the late 19th century, which elected MPs to the Parliament of the United Kingdom. However, the language suffered under centralisation efforts by the Scottish and later British states, especially after the Battle of Culloden in 1746, during the Highland Clearances, and by the exclusion of Scottish Gaelic from the educational system. According to Yale University music professor Willie Ruff, the singing of psalms in Scottish Gaelic by Presbyterians of the Scottish Hebrides evolved from \\"lining out\\" ‚Äì where one person sings a solo before others follow ‚Äì into the call and response of gospel music of the southern USA. The veracity of this claim has, however, been disputed. An Irish translation of the Bible dating from the Elizabethan era was in use until the Bible was translated into Scottish Gaelic. Author David Ross notes in his 2002 history of Scotland that a Scottish Gaelic version of the Bible was published in London in 1690 by the Rev. Robert Kirk, minister of Aberfoyle; however it was not widely circulated. The first well-known translation of the Bible into Scottish Gaelic was made in 1767 when Dr James Stuart of Killin and Dugald Buchanan of Rannoch produced a translation of the New Testament. Very few European languages have made the transition to a modern literary language without an early modern translation of the Bible. The lack of a well-known translation until the late 18th century may have contributed to the decline of Scottish Gaelic. In the 21st century, Scottish Gaelic literature has seen development within the area of prose fiction publication, as well as challenges due to the continuing decline of the languageStorey, John (2011) \\"Contemporary Gaelic fiction: development, challenge and opportunity\\" Lainnir a‚Äô Bh√πirn' ‚Äì The Gleaming Water: Essays on Modern Gaelic Literature, edited by Emma Dymock & Wilson McLeod, Dunedin Academic Press. . Defunct dialects All surviving dialects are Highland and/or Hebridean dialects. Dialects of Lowland Gaelic have become defunct since the demise of Galwegian Gaelic, originally spoken in Galloway, which seems to have been the last Lowland dialect and which survived into the Modern Period. By the 18th century Lowland Gaelic had been largely replaced by Lowland Scots across much of Lowland Scotland. According to a reference in The Carrick Covenanters by James Crichton,Printed at the Office of Messrs. Arthur Guthrie and Sons Ltd., 49 Ayr Road, Cumnock the last place in the Lowlands where Scottish Gaelic was still spoken was the village of Barr in Carrick: only a few miles inland to the east of Girvan, but at one time very isolated. Crichton gives neither date nor details.For further discussion on the subject of Gaelic in the South of Scotland, see articles ' (\\"Gaelic of Galloway and Southern Scotland\\") and ' (\\"Gaelic in Ayrshire\\") by Garbhan MacAoidh, published in GAIRM Numbers 101 and 106. There is no evidence from place names of significant linguistic differences between, for example, Argyll and Galloway. Dialects on both sides of the Straits of Moyle (the North Channel) linking Scottish Gaelic with Irish are now extinct, though native speakers were still to be found on the Mull of Kintyre, Rathlin and in North East Ireland as late as the mid-20th century. Records of their speech show that Irish and Scottish Gaelic existed in a dialect chain with no clear language boundary. What is known as Scottish Gaelic is essentially the Gaelic spoken in the Outer Hebrides and on Skye. Generally speaking, the Gaelic spoken across the Western Isles is similar enough to be classed as one major dialect group, although there is still regional variation. For example, the slender 'r' is pronounced in Lewis, where the Gaelic is thought to have been influenced by Norse, and had a pitch accent system.Oftedal, Magne The Gaelic of Leurbost, Isle of Lewis 1956 Norsk Tidsskrift for Sprogvidenskap Gaelic in Eastern and Southern Scotland is now largely defunct, although the dialects which were spoken in the east tended to preserve a more archaic tone, which had been lost further west. For example, Gaelic speakers in East Sutherland preferred to say ' (\\"Where were you about last night?\\"), rather than the more common '. Such dialects, along with Manx and Irish, also retain the Classical Gaelic values of the stops, while most dialects underwent devoicing and preaspiration. A certain number of these dialects, which are now defunct in Scotland, have been preserved, and indeed re-established, in the Nova Scotia Gaelic community. Those of particular note are the Morar and Lochaber dialects, the latter of which pronounces the broad or velarised l () as [].

Early life Justin Olam was born and raised in Gon, a tiny village in the Sinesine Yonggomugl District of Chimbu Province, Papua New Guinea. He never played too much rugby league because both his parents were big on his education. Olam was educated at (Muaina Secondary School), Chimbu and will then graduate and attend the Papua New Guinea University of Technology in Lae Morobe Province. It was there he graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Applied Physics. Olam played his first and consecurtive junior rugby league for Unitech Spartans in the PNG Universities competition while in year two (2). In 2015 While in year (3) at the Papua New Guinea University of Technology he went onto play for the Lae Snax Tigers in the Papua New Guinea National Rugby League. Playing career =2016= After impressive performance in the Digicel Cup for the Lae Snax Tigers in the Papua New Guinea National Rugby League, he was signed by the PNG Hunters for the 2016 Queensland Cup season. He played for them for one year in the Queensland Cup. He went on to make his international debut for Papua New Guinea Kumuls at the 2016 Pacific Test against Fiji Bati.

He was still patient for an opportunity to make the Melbourne Storm first grade team. He also continued to represent Papua New Guinea Kumuls in the 2017 Pacific Test and 2017 Rugby League World Cup. =2018= In round 9 of the 2018 NRL season Olam made his NRL debut in the centers for the Melbourne Storm against the St George Illawarra Dragons at Jubilee Oval were he set up a try for his winger Josh Addo-Carr. He then played two further games at the end of the season in round 24 against Gold Coast Titans and round 25 against Penrith Panthers in the NRL season. He continued international representation for his beloved Papua New Guinea Kumuls in the Pacific Test against Fiji Bati in Sydney and two end of year test against the England Knights in Lae and Port Moresby. His contract was extended for another two years after impressive string of performance in the reserve grade which will keep him at the Melbourne Storm till the end of the 2020 NRL season. =2019= In round 24 of the 2019 NRL season Olam scored his first ever NRL hat-trick in his 13th game against Manly Sea Eagles at Lottoland Brookvale Oval. He finished off strongly in the 2019 season with him playing in 14 games and scored 7 tries at the back end of the season, and touted by many as one of the most Improved NRL player of the modern era. His continuous rising in the top grade kept the likes of Will Chambers, Sandor Earl, Curtis Scott, Solomone Kata and Marion Seve on the bench or cooling their heels off in reserve grade. On 2 October, Olam was named in the Papua New Guinea Kumuls team for the inaugural 2019 Rugby League World Cup 9s.

With his current scintillating form he was rewarded with a two-year contract on May 22 to keep him at the Storm until the end of 2022. Affectionately known as 'the human brick', by his teammates, Olam plays with seemingly no sense of self- preservation. His passion has won him countless fans in Melbourne and at home in PNG. He scored his first try of the 2020 season in round four against South Sydney Rabbitohs. In round 16 he scored his second career Hat-trick against Manly Sea Eagles. On October 16, in Melbourne's Preliminary Final game against the Canberra Raiders at Suncorp Stadium, Justin Olam scored a try in the 23rd minute off a kick from teammate Ryan Papenhuyzen, miraculously leaping over both Papenhuyzen and Raiders player Hudson Young while avoiding the arm of Nick Cotric to catch the ball mid-air before grounding it.

It was an early form of currency swap. In a parallel loan there is an exchange of currencies between four parties which promises that the loan will be repaid at a specified future date and predetermined exchange rate. It consists of two pairs of the affiliated companies and two pairs parents companies in two different countries. It occurs between two companies simultaneously when a company has a relative advantage in the cost of funds and then borrows those funds to a foreign affiliate in its own country at a rate lower than the foreign affiliate would have to pay at its parent company‚Äôs country. Besides that, the parallel loan is ‚Äúsimilar to cross-border loan, but there are no currencies in the foreign exchange markets‚Äù. The parallel loan is very similar to a back-to-back loan. The parallel loan was one of the proactive management of operating exposure that offsetting expected foreign exchange exposure. Two business companies in different countries will borrow currency to each other for a particular period of time and they will return the borrowed currencies on the date they agreed to with the same loaned amount. The two loans will be valued at the prevailing spot rate and the prescribed period. The currencies borrowing activities conducted outside the foreign exchange market to avoid foreign exchange risk and legal limitations. History The parallel loan was established in the early 1970s in effect of the exchange controls in the United Kingdom on British companies. The implementation of exchange control has caused many British firms withdrawn their decision to extend their business because investing in foreign market is not attractive. After the abolition of foreign exchange control in 1979, parallel loan kept on being utilized with the goal of hedging long-term foreign currency exposure at a lower cost than what will be imposed in the foreign exchange market. At that time, UK organizations needed to pay a premium to get a loan in US dollars. In order to prevent this situation, UK organizations set up parallel or back-to-back loan agreement with US organizations that wish to acquire sterling. The parallel loan market was created to avoid confinements imposed by the Bank of England on the free stream of British pounds. Most of the British companies who are desire to invest abroad need to change pounds into US dollars at an exchange rate over the market exchange rate. The motivation behind this strategy was to safeguard the value of the pound among other currencies. However, companies actually were not keen on providing financial aid to the Bank of England by committing the above-market rate for every dollar obtained from the exchange rate implemented in the policy. Prevention for these currency control leads straightforwardly to the improvement of the market for the currency swaps. Initiated as a way of avoiding currency regulations, the practice had, by the mid-1990s, largely been replaced by currency swaps. Advantages and disadvantages The parallel loan not only evolved to circumvent exchange control regulations, but it also permits companies to borrow funds in foreign currencies at rates lower than they might get in foreign exchange market, as overseas companies. In this situation, the parallel loan brings a few advantages and disadvantages to the companies. =Advantages= # Cost of the fund is fixed: The transfer of funds is less costly for both companies compared to the cost of financing from its parent company and loans from banks. In addition, the subsidiary in the country may face the problem of higher lending cost from banks if the subsidiary is not well known and its credit rating may not as high as its parent company. # Protection against exchange rate risk: There is no foreign exchange exposure since it uses local currency where the subsidiaries are located and there is no need to enter the foreign exchange market to repay the loans. =Disadvantages= # Hard to find counterparties with the matching needs: Company may face the problem of finding its counterparty with the mirror image financing needs with another company such as the currencies, principals, type of interest payments, frequency of the interest payments and length of the loan period. # Obligated to comply with an agreement even opposite party fails to fulfill the obligation: In order to prevent this situation happen, a separate agreement is registered to offset the party who being defaulted by another party. # Large fees imposed on matching two companies: There is a need to hire a brokerage or investment banker to arrange this type of transactions and the companies who hire need to paid an amount of fees to the brokerage houses.

Deeply embedded into the Melbourne and global start up scene's network, One Roof seeks to fill what it perceives as a gap in offerings that specifically address women's needs in business. Its emphasis on its social mission aligns it more closely with social enterprise than profit- driven start-up.  Early Days  One Roof Women was founded by former corporate lawyer, Sheree Rubinstein and US based strategist, Gianna Wurzl. In 2015, after establishing coworking spaces in Melbourne and Los Angeles, Rubinstein and Wurzl incorporated a Sydney women's coworking space, founded by Dr Catriona Wallace, into their stable. Initially focused on growth, the early iteration of the One Roof model looked at conversions of under-utilised physical spaces, to transform them into shared workspaces for women. Leveraging the conversion of these physical spaces, one Roof sought to create a complete ecosystem supporting women in business. This ecosystem incorporated traditional networking and publicity infrastructure, such as business and start-up events and workshops, into less traditional support structures, such as yoga and meditation classes. These elements were buttressed by networked service provision for new businesses, such as legal, finance, fundraising, and communications services.  Evolution  While the Los Angeles and Sydney branches transformed into virtual networks, the Melbourne branch, run by Sheree Rubinstein, experienced enormous growth. In April 2016, One Roof took over space in Southbank and transformed it into an entrepreneurship hub that realised the initial goals of the One Roof founders, offering dedicated office space as well as coworking space. One Roof estimates it has engaged 10,000 women, across four cities, and hosted over 500 workshops. In recognition of One Roof's contribution to women in business, Rubinstein won the 2016 Victorian Young Achievers Leadership Award and was nominated as one of Australia's top young innovators by The Foundation for Young Australians. In 2015, Rubinstein won a $10,000 seed grant from BASF to drive innovation. Rubinstein continued her connection with the One Roof charity partner, SHE, run by Melbourne-based non-profit YGAP, which seeks to foster female entrepreneurs via its accelerator programmes in Kenya, South Africa and Australia in a bid to improve the lives of women and girls.

Its traditional form is actually a by-product of the process of making omegi sul (sul is a Korean word for alcoholic beverages). The modern form of omegi tteok uses entirely different ingredients and is only packaged and marketed as \\"traditional\\" mainly to be sold as a regional specialty snack for visitors. It is now one of the best selling souvenirs among the tourists in Jeju Island.  Development  = Traditional Variety of Omegi Tteok = The main ingredient of the traditional variety of both omegi tteok and omegi sul is a particular type of millet once produced in large quantities in Jeju Island known as chajo (Ï∞®Ï°∞). Before the 21st century, a traditional Jeju household would use chajo as a replacement for a lot of the more difficult to find grains such as rice or wheat. This is an example of how the traditional Jeju cuisine differs from the rest of the traditional Korean cuisine. Because the island's cuisine developed with a more limited variety of food ingredients compared to the rest of the Korean inland provinces, some of its traditional food items tend to be less flavorful and more rustic like this traditional variety of omegi tteok. In addition, tteok in general was not made for snacking in Jeju Island. Instead, the people of Jeju Island mainly used tteok as an item of sacrifice for the spirits during events like gut (Íµø, shamanistic rituals). Having such purpose, most traditional Jeju tteok do not have a lot of flavor and are not very marketable in their original form. The process of making traditional omegi tteok and omegi sul only requires chajo, yeast, and water. Although this is no longer the case for most commercially sold omegi tteok nowadays, it is worth reviewing the traditional process for the sake of preserving the unique culture revolving around the notion of food in Jeju Island. First, the chajo is soaked in water and ground to produce chajo powder. Then the powder is mixed with water and kneaded into a dough. The dough is then rolled into small oval shapes with a sunken center, much like a small doughnut, to ensure that it cooks thoroughly. Then they are boiled in water. When they rise to the top, the cooked dough is removed from water. It is in this step of the process that some of the cooked dough is set aside to be consumed as omegi tteok. Before giving this cooked chajo dough for the children to nibble on as snack, the parent or the grandparent would roll some of this dough in red bean gomul (Í≥†Î¨º, ground grain used mostly as topping) in order to prevent the children from burning their tongue. This is the original form of the omegi tteok. The rest of the cooked dough is kneaded again into a paste-like consistency and mixed with yeast to ferment into the omegi sul. In this way, the original form of omegi tteok was never meant to be preserved for a long time and sold in a shop. In fact, the cooked chajo dough becomes hard and inedible even after just a day of being left to chill. Hence, the modern variety of omegi tteok has changed significantly in both form and taste. = Modern Variety of Omegi Tteok = The sudden rise of popularity of omegi tteok within the South Korean tourism industry started in the early 2010s. As a result, the look, the taste, and the makeup of the omegi tteok has changed significantly in recent years, almost to the point of becoming an entirely different variety of tteok. Due to the fact that chajo is no longer produced in large quantity, most store bought omegi tteok do not contain chajo at all. Instead, this new branding of omegi tteok borrows the look, the name and the ‚Äútraditional branding‚Äù of its original counterpart. In order to cater to the taste bud of the younger generation, the recipe for the modern omegi tteok now uses glutinous rice powder mixed with mugwort and sugar. The rice powder makes the tteok more chewy while the addition of mugwort helps to simulate the green color of the original omegi tteok. The sugar makes it sweeter, promoting the omegi tteok into the marketable dessert product status. The modern mix of ingredients also makes it easier to store and preserve the omegi tteok, so that it can be sold and shipped all over the country. Several vendors are even experimenting with different gomul such as nuts, in place of the ground red bean, or adding foreign flavors like banana into the dough.

He won the IBSF Amateur World Championship in 1973 and regarded as the greatest snooker player of Sri Lanka.  Biography  Muhammad Lafir was born on 27 May 1930 in Grandpass, a suburb of Colombo, at St. Joseph's Street. He had two brothers and a sister in his family. He studied at Hameediah Boys English School (now known as Hameed Al Husseinie College). He died on 26 April 1981 at his own house.  Career  Lafir learnt the game of billiards and pursued his interest in the sport at the age of seven through his father S. L. M. Junaid. His father was a domestic snooker player who has played in friendly domestic tournaments and it inspired Lafir to take up the sport. He initially learnt to play billiards on his family dining table very often with his father using a broomstick as a cue and marbles a cue balls. He joined the Moors Islamic Cultural Home in 1947 and played friendly tournaments representing it. Lafir also took part in Sri Lankan National Billiards Championships and won his first national snooker championship in 1948. He then reigned the Sri Lanka National Snooker Championship from 1952 to 1973, winning 16 successive tournaments. He also then participated in the Indian Snooker Championship and won it on seven occasions (1956, 1957, 1959, 1961, 1963, 1974-75 and 1976). He managed to defeat Indian national champion Chandra Hirjee in the 1956 and 1957 Indian Snooker Championship finals. A renowned businessman U. W. Sumathipala came forward to assist Lafir in terms of financial needs after watching him scoring 500 break points in a domestic friendly game. Sumathipala assisted him to take part in overseas International competitions and Lafir also took part in friendly tours organised and sponsored by U. W. Sumathipala's son Jagath Sumathipala. Former Sri Lankan Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike also supported Lafir and gave financial assistance in order to take part in international competitions. Lafir also competed at Amateur World Championships and he finished 3rd on his debut World Championships in 1963 which was held in Calcutta. He finished at fourth position in the 1966 Snooker World Amateur World Championship. He also emerged as runners-up to England's Leslie Driffield at the 1967 IBSF World Billiards Championship. He again finished at third position at the 1968 Snooker Amateur World Championship and finished fourth place in the 1971 World Amateur Championship. Lafir became the world champion in billiards in December 1973 World Amateur Billiards Championship by defeating Satish Mohan of India in the finals held in Mumbai. He had an outstanding unbeaten run in the 1973 tournament winning all nine matches and remained unbeaten in the tournament. He defeated Clive Everton, Michael Ferreira, Lu Demarco, Alfred Nolan, Eric Simmons, Brian Kirkness, Phil Tarrant and Paul Mifsud in the round robin and preliminary rounds to reach his second IBSF finals and went onto defeat Sathish Mohan in the final. During the tournament, in a match against New Zealand's Eric Simmons he created a world record for highest break in a single set with 859 points. It also remained as the only world championship title won by him. Lafir became the first Sri Lankan to win a billiards world championship and still remains as the only Sri Lankan to have won a billiards world championship title. This was also the first time that a Sri Lankan has won a world championship title in any form of sports competition. However he wasn't able to defend his world title in the next World Championships in 1974 eventually being knocked out in the quarterfinals. He later served as an employee for Sri Lanka Transport Board after retiring from professional billiards.  Honours  Lafir was acknowledged by the ministers of the then government following his triumph at the 1973 World Championships. He was given a special red carpet welcome gesture on 22 December 1973 at the Katunayake International Airport following his way return to Sri Lanka after taking part in the competition. On 31 December 1973, he was accorded with civic reception by the mayor of Colombo Municipal Council, Vincent Perera. Government of Sri Lanka honoured his achievements by issuing a national stamp with his face appearing on the front side. After his death, on his 53rd birthday anniversary Messenger Street which is one of the prominent places in Sri Lanka was renamed as MJM Lafir Mawatha.

The game is a prequel to the open-world adventure game Eastshade. While set in the same setting as the larger title, it features distinct game mechanics and story. The game was announced January 11, 2017, less than a month prior to its release on February 8, 2017. To avoid confusion with Eastshade, which was in development at the time, the developer released a short video explaining the reasoning and history behind the small titles' odd format and development.  Plot  Leaving Lyndow take place on the island of Eastshade. You play as Clara, who has recently graduated from the Guild of Maritime Exploration, and are preparing to embark on a long and dangerous research expedition. Throughout the game, you speak to her friends and family, learning about their feelings regarding your departure. > It's Clara's last day on the island where she grew up. With high honors, > she's graduated and fulfilled her childhood dream of joining the Guild of > Maritime Exploration. She needs to complete preparations, visit her favorite > places, and say her goodbyes - before leaving on a journey she may not > return from. *Dangerous journey not included* The game's story concerns the events immediately prior to Clara's departure, not the journey itself.  Gameplay  The game is played from the first- person perspective. While it features some light puzzle elements and mini- games, the bulk of the interaction in the game manifests through dialog trees. There is some player choice in the order the player visits the environments, but other than this game is mostly linear, and has an immutable ending.  Development  Eastshade Studios stopped development of their larger title Eastshade to make Leaving Lyndow, with plans to continue Eastshade once Leaving Lyndow released. The Developer mentioned in a video addressed to fans of Eastshade that the reasons for Leaving Lyndow's development were three- fold: They wanted experience shipping a game before attempting to ship their much larger title Eastshade, they wanted to use Leaving Lyndow's revenue to supplement Eastshade's funding, and they thought the game would enrich the Eastshade universe. While the game uses much of the assets and technology from Eastshade, story content had to be made uniquely, and some of the environments were made unique for the title. The game's development took about six months.  Reception  Leaving Lyndow received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic. The game's most common criticism was that it was too short. Kotaku's Nathan Grayson said \\"It's the sort of thing that anybody who's ever left home can identify with, and it helped me come to terms with some goodbyes I'll probably need to say soon.\\" VideoGamer's Alice Bell praised the game for having intelligently written characters. Polygon's Colin Campbell applauded the game's \\"niceness\\". CGMagazine's Lane Martin criticized the game for being somewhat of a paid commercial, albeit a beautiful and fascinating one. He closed his review with \\"Leaving Lyndow is a beautiful experience in a fascinating world, but may be more of a 45-minute-long commercial for the upcoming Eastshade than an actual game.\\" OnlySP's Damien Lawardorn said Leaving Lyndow lacked characterization and thematic depth, but praised its world-building and mentioned it promises better things on the horizon.

Chan School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts. She also holds an appointment as professor of pediatrics in the Harvard Medical School. In addition, she is the senior associate for academic affairs in the department of neonatology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Her research primarily focused on epidemiology and health services, particularly in relation to infant mortality and the outcomes of very low birthweight (VLBW) and otherwise high-risk neonates. Early life Marie McCormick is the daughter of Clare B. (Keleher) McCormick and Atty. Richard J. McCormick, Jr. of Haverhill, Massachusetts, where she spent her youth and attended St. James (Roman Catholic) Church. She had three siblings. Her mother's first name became Marie's middle name.  Education  McCormick is a graduate of Emmanuel College (B.A., 1967) and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland (M.D., 1971). She completed a Pediatric residency/fellowship at Johns Hopkins Hospital during which she also completed a second doctorate at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in health services research (Sc.D., 1978). She has held academic positions at the Abraham Lincoln School of Medicine of the University of Illinois, the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, and the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.  Career  McCormick, who is licensed to practice pediatric medicine in Massachusetts, joined the Harvard Medical School in 1987 as associate professor of pediatrics and director of the Infant Follow-up Program at Boston Children's Hospital. In 1992, she was selected to be the chair of the Department of Maternal and Child Health at the Harvard School of Public Health, which position she held until 2003 when the department was merged with another to create the now Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences. She is the director of a standing training program in maternal and child health, which has had sustained federal funding for over 60 years, and she teaches the foundational course in this topic at Harvard Chan. McCormick is internationally recognized for her research in the outcomes of high-risk infants, especially preterm infants, and the evaluation of programs to improve their outcomes. She was co-principal investigator of a national demonstration program to assess the effect of regionalizing perinatal services to improve neonatal mortality. In addition, she was a major contributor, in a variety of roles and principal investigator of the follow-up at 18 years of age, to the Infant Health and Development Program, a controlled trial of and early childhood educational intervention for preterm, low birth weight infants. While she is a member of several professional societies, her most active roles have been in the Academic Pediatric Association where she now holds the position of Senior Associate Editor for the journal, Academic Pediatrics, and in the Institute of Medicine/National Academy of Medicine to which she was elected a member in 1997. She has chaired several significant committees for the latter including the Committee on Perinatal Transmission of HIV,Stoto MA, Almario DA, McCormick MC (eds). Reducing the Odds Preventing Perinatal Transmission of HIV in the United States, Washington, DC: National Academies Press, 1999 and, most recently, the Committee on the Health Effects of Marijuana.The Health Effects of Cannabis and Cannabinoids, the Current State of Evidence and Recommendations for Research. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press, 2016. However, her most important role was a chair of the Committee on Immunization Safety, which issued, among others, three reports noting no association of immunizations with autism, a role for which she received the David Rall Medal from the Institute of Medicine for exceptional committee service.Stratton K, Gable A, Shetty P, McCormick MC (Eds.): Immunization Safety Review: measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and Autism.

History =Origin= 16 Brigade 81 Armoured Brigade was activated on 1 August 1974 but can trace its origins back to an older structure in the late 1960s, called 16 Brigade, under the control of Northern Transvaal Command. On 1 August 1974, through a reorganization of the Army's conventional force, the name was changed to 81 Armoured Brigade.Englebrecht, Leon (9 February 2010). \\"Fact file: The SA Armoured Corps\\". DefenceWeb. Retrieved 21 January 2015. Initial Structure Under this reorganisation, the following units were transferred to the new command: *Regiment Northern Transvaal, *Pretoria Regiment, *South African Irish Regiment, *Regiment Molopo, *Natal Mounted Rifles, *2 Light Horse Regiment, *5 Forward Delivery Squadron, *17 Field Regiment/Regiment University of Pretoria, *15 Field Engineers Regiment, *20 Maintenance Unit, *32 Field Workshop, *81 Signal Unit, *81 Field Ambulance Structure SADF 81 Armoured Brigade Higher Command 81 Armoured Brigade resorted under the new 8 Division.SADF era Brigade level Sergeant Major insignia =Units mechanised and armoured= The Brigade's philosophy was to be up-armoured and highly mobile. All units in the Brigade irrelevant of their Corps was either to be armoured or mechanised. In light of this the Saracen armoured car was used for the last time by Regiment Northern Transvaal and the new Ratel Infantry Fighting Vehicle was introduced. Mechanised elements were also introduced to 17 Field Artillery where the Sexton, a 25-pounder artillery gun mounted on Sherman chassis was introduced. Mechanised infantry was a new concept in 1975, the biggest change being the increase in tempo and close proximity to armour in battle. In 1976, 40 command group members of Regiment Northern Transvaal underwent mechanised conversion training at 1 SAI. Pretoria Regiment was also busy converting at the same time to a modernised version of the Centurion Tank, the Oliphant at the School of Armour. 2 Light Horse, the Brigades armoured car regiment, was attached following Operation Savannah to service in South West Africa and therefore was not involved in the mechanisation program at that stage. =Brigade Training and Exercises = 81 Armoured Brigade conducted its first training exercise at the General de Wet Training Range, Tempe, near Bloemfontein in September 1975 with Exercise Mainstay. Three combat groups were activated. Over a period of three months, the area was allocated from one combat group to the next. *Alpha Combat Group: The Natal Mounted Rifles under command of Commandant Palframan commanded the first combat group. * Bravo Combat Group: The second combat group was commanded by the Pretoria Regiment under command of Commandant Holztrager *Charlie Combat Group: The Regiment Northern Transvaal controlled the third combat group. The General de Wet training range was quickly deemed too small for modern armoured mechanised exercises at Brigade level. Because of the limitations of the General de Wet Range, a new Training Area was opened in the next year to accommodate large scale conventional war training, namely Army Battle School at Lohatla. The honour to use the new property for the first time rested with 81 Armoured Brigade, who conducted the following brigade exercises (Ex) over the next few years:81 Pantser Brigade: Historiese Oorsig 1974 ‚Äì 1991, Cmdt L.F.

The most important of these was probably Combat Group Foxtrot. After retraining, combat groups left Lohatla for Oshivello and Ongiva under the command of the Joint Monitoring Commission. Some of these operations included: *The Brigade's Regiment Northern Transvaal A and B companies supported 102 Battalion at Opuwa. *The brigade acted as the \\"Force in Being\\" (Conventional Reserve Force) in 1984. Three Combat Groups were deployed in the Operational Area (Sector 10). *From 15 July 1988 to 19 September 1988 The Brigade participated in a sub operation of Operation Prone namely Operation Pact. Under command of Brigadier Chris Serfontein, the OC of Sector 10, the entire Brigade under command of Colonel Jan Lusse was deployed in Owamboland as mobile reserve during the final phases of implementation of UN Resolution 435, which led to the independence of South West Africa/Namibia.Wikipedia Operation Prone *The Brigades sub-elements, Pretoria Regiment and Regiment Molopo was used in Operations Hooper and Moduler. =Presentation of National Colours= The climax of 81 Armoured Brigade was on 1 Aug 91 when the then Chief of the Army Lt Genl G.L. Meiring handed over National Colours to the following CF units of the Brigade (Unit Commanders and Regimental Sergeant Majors indicated): *17 Field Regiment Cmdt H.J. Bootha, WO1 A.B.

The Brigade was congratulated by Chief of the Army for a spectacular parade. This was the final official act by 81 Armoured Brigade and the climax on a 17-year illustrious history. =Restructuring= With the independence of Namibia, the conventional threat dissipated and the SA Army Command began a process of rationalisation. Brigade headquarters were now focussed on counter-insurgency support to regional commands. SA Army Implementing Instruction 3/91 gave orders for the disbandment of 81 Armoured Brigade, which happened on 29 Nov 1991. The CF Units under command were reorganised as follows: *SA Irish Regiment under command Northern Cape Command *1 Regiment Northern Transvaal under command of 8 SA Division *Pretoria Regiment under command of 8 SA Division *2 Light Horse Regiment under command of 8 SA Division *17 Field Regiment amalgamate with Transvaal Staats Artillery *15 Field Engineer Regiment amalgamate with 10 Engineer Regiment *81 Signal Unit amalgamate with Northern Cape Command Signal Unit *20 Maintenance Unit amalgamate with 15 Maintenance Unit of 8 SA Division *32 Field Workshop under command of Army Battle School  Insignia  SADF era 81 Armoured Brigade insignia Leadership  =Brigade Commanders= *Brigadier F.E.C van den Berg 1974-1974 *Colonel P.J.

As with similar greenhoods, the flowering plants differ from those which are not flowering. The non-flowering plants have a rosette of leaves flat on the ground but the flowering plants have a single flower with leaves on the flowering spike. Description Pterostylis aestiva is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and when not flowering, a rosette of dark bluish-green leaves, each leaf long and wide. Flowering plants have a single flower long and wide borne on a spike high with between three and five stem leaves. The flowers are dark bluish-green, white and brown. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column. The dorsal sepal curves forward with a thread-like tip long. The lateral sepals are held closely against the galea, have an erect, thread-like tip long and a protruding sinus between their bases. The labellum is long, about wide, brown, blunt, and curved and protrudes above the sinus. Flowering occurs from January to April.  Taxonomy and naming  Pterostylis aestiva was first formally described in 1972 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Wulgulmerang. The description was published in Muelleria. The specific epithet (aestiva) is a Latin word meaning \\"pertaining to summer\\". Distribution and habitat The long-tongued summer greenhood grows among grasses in high rainfall forests in north-east Victoria and New South Wales as far north as Mount Canobolas. Use in horticulture This greenhood is easily grows in pots although plants must be kept moist during the growing season and dry when dormant.

She is an entrepreneur and advocate for women's advancement in business leadership.  Career  Sheree graduated law school and was employed by one of Melbourne's top firms. Driven by an entrepreneurial spirit combined with a desire to foster social enterprise, Rubinstein decided to leave the confines of her 'top tier' law firm for advocacy for women in business. = Establishment of One Roof = In 2015, Rubinstein joined with US based strategist, Gianna Wurzl to found One Roof with bases in Melbourne and Los Angeles. The early iteration of the One Roof model looked at conversions of under-used physical spaces, to transform them into shared work spaces supporting women in business. The intent was to combine traditional support such as networking, events and workshops, and access to legal, finance, fundraising, and communications services, with less traditional support such as yoga and meditation classes. While the Los Angeles and Sydney branches transformed into virtual networks, not using physical space, the Melbourne branch, run by Sheree Rubinstein experienced enormous growth. In April 2016, One Roof took over space in Southbank establishing dedicated office space as well as coworking space. One Roof estimates it has engaged 10,000 women, across four cities, and hosted over 500 workshops. Rubinstein continued her connection with the One Roof charity partner, SHE, run by Melbourne-based non- profit YGAP, which seeks to foster female entrepreneurs via its accelerator programmes in Kenya, South Africa and Australia in a bid to improve the lives of women and girls.  Awards and grants  In recognition of One Roof's contribution to women in business, Rubinstein won the 2016 Victorian Young Achievers Leadership Award and was nominated as one of Australia's top young innovators by The Foundation for Young Australians. In 2015, Rubinstein won a $10,000 seed grant from BASF to drive innovation. In October 2018 Rubinstein was named one of the Young Leaders in The Australian Financial Review 100 Women of Influence awards.
