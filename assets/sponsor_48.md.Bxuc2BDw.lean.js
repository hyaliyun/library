The parish includes the settlements of Henley Common, Kingsley Green and Bell Vale, lies within the boundaries of the South Downs National Park and is surrounded by hills. The area of the parish is . In the 2001 census there were 1,158 households with a total population of 2,765 of whom 1,244 were economically active. The population had increased to 2,942 at the 2011 Census. Geography The village is surrounded by hills, including Telegraph Hill at , Marley Heights at , Bexley Hill at , Fridays Hill at and the highest hill in Sussex, Blackdown at , to the northeast. Fernhurst is surrounded by miles of footpaths, the path to the summit of Blackdown commencing at the Red Lion pub. History The village, on the Weald, originally developed around crossroads (The Cross) and the village green, and ancient remains (Stone Age and Roman) have been found here. Iron working took place in the 17th/18th centuries; and a turnpike ran through the village. The church, dedicated to St Margaret, () and Red Lion pub are on the green, where several old houses still remain. With the coming of the railway to Haslemere the village developed around and beyond The Cross, and since the 1960s the village has expanded further westwards. The village houses a commuter population, attracted by the proximity of Haslemere railway station. In November 2006 the Fernhurst Society published a book, \\"Voices of Fernhurst\\", comprising edited extracts of oral history interviews with local villagers. Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward includes Linchmere and had at the 2011 census a total ward population of 5,334. St Margaret's Church The Anglican parish church, dedicated to St Margaret, was rebuilt in the nineteenth century, the south aisle in 1859 and the tower and spire as part of a general restoration by Anthony Salvin in 1881. The interior is plain. May Revels Every May the traditional \\"Revels\\" fete is held on the green, raising funds for village societies and some local charities. The event includes various local May-time celebrations, such as maypole dancing, and the May queen is elected from the local area. In May 2006 a film of the village for the Meridian ITV programme \\"Village voices\\" was filmed involving the revels and local craftsmen. It was screened on 15 August 2006. Verdley estate Verdley Place About a mile south east of the village lies the Verdley estate. Verdley Castle, probably a 14th-century fortified manor house, or hunting tower, now demolished, lay in present-day Henley Wood. Its concealed wooded location in a hollow afforded protection for smugglers bringing goods from the south coast. Closer to the village, Verdley Place was built by architect Anthony Salvin in 1873‚Äì5, as a country house for Charles Savile Roundell. Baron Davey was living here with his wife, three daughters and a son in the 1891 census. This Grade II listed building and the surrounding estate was the home of ICI's Plant Protection Division and its predecessors from 1945 at the Fernhurst Research Station and subsequently a Zeneca research and development centre. It has since been sold and converted to a residential development.

In the 1950s, he moved to Buffalo where he became the chief play-by- play announcer for the Buffalo Bills Radio Network, the official radio broadcasting arm of the Buffalo Bills of the National Football League from the team's inception as an AFL team in 1960 to 1971, and again from 1977 to 2003. At the time of his retirement in 2003, Miller was the longest-tenured commentator with one team (37 years) in pro football history. Career On July 30, 1960, Van Miller debuted on the air at War Memorial Stadium to call play-by-play for the Bills' inaugural contest against the Boston Patriots. Besides his status as the \\"Voice of the Bills,\\" Miller was the sports director for WBEN-TV/WIVB-TV for many years. During that time, he served as a sportscaster, weather reporter, and as host of the local version of It's Academic and Beat the Champ (a ten-pin bowling show), among other shows. Miller also hosted a popular afternoon program for many years on WBEN radio. Miller called Buffalo Braves and Niagara University basketball, Buffalo Bisons baseball, Buffalo Stallions soccer, University at Buffalo football and, in his early years, high school sports. Miller continued play-by-play for college basketball well into the 1990s for Empire Sports Network, giving the upstart network credibility in its formative years.http://www.allsportswny.com/van- miller-was-van-tastic/ With the exception of a seven-season hiatus from 1972 through 1978, when the Bills were being carried on rival station WKBW-AM (and Miller was covering the Buffalo Braves), Miller covered the Bills for most of the team's existence. This period included the AFL championship in 1964 and 1965, and the Super Bowl run of the early 1990s. Miller shared the booth with color men Stan Barron, Jefferson Kaye (a trio known as Van, Stan and Fan, which ended with Barron's death and Kaye's departure to Philadelphia to join NFL Films in 1984) and John Murphy. In 2004, Miller retired and Murphy succeeded him as the Bills' play-by-play voice. Of all of his commentary duties, Miller considered the Bills position his favorite; he took personal regret when WKBW picked up Bills rights in 1972, felt serious discomfort having to wish successor Al Meltzer luck, and expressed great pleasure when WBEN had reacquired rights to the Bills' broadcasts.http://history.buffalonews.com/2014/11/04/nov-4-1979-van-miller- stan-barron-back-football-perch/ In 1995, Miller wrote and performed a song, \\"I've Got That Phoenix Feeling,\\" which got significant airplay on WBEN and WIVB.I've Got That Phoenix Feeling Contrary to Miller's prediction, the Bills did not reach Super Bowl XXX, which was played in Phoenix that year. After 43 years, Miller called his final broadcast for the Bills as they lost 31-0 to the New England Patriots (the same franchise Buffalo had faced for Miller's first broadcast in 1960) in the last game of the 2003 regular season. Life after retirement and death Miller retired with Gloria Miller, whom he had married in 1953, in the town of Tonawanda, New York. During retirement, Miller did guest sports commentary appearances and voiced commercials for some Western New York retail businesses (notably the Grapevine Restaurant, where he was known as \\"Van the Grapevine Man\\"). The Pro Football Hall of Fame presented him with its Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award in 2004. He is an inductee in the Buffalo Broadcasting Hall of Fame (1998), Greater Buffalo Sports Hall of Fame (1999), and the Chautauqua Sports Hall of Fame (2002). Miller was an avid tennis player and often paired with Jack Ramsay in doubles matches.http://bills.buffalonews.com/2015/07/18/there-was-only-one-van-miller- a-critics-appreciation/ Signature calls include: \\"Fandemonium\\" - often referring to the celebrations after big Bills wins, and \\"Do you believe it?\\" after an exciting and often game-changing play. Miller also had a custom-made routine he used when being interviewed on radio shows, in which he called a fictional game in which the host of the show carries the ball just short of the end zone only to fumble on the goal line, after which Miller mocked anguish.http://www.buffalobills.com/news/article-1/In-remembrance-Van-Miller- through-the-eyes-of-John- Murphy/2173371e-cb02-4c25-9993-3b0159328153?campaign=tw_buf_article Miller was inducted onto the Buffalo Bills Wall of Fame on October 19, 2014. He died July 17, 2015 at the age of 87, from complications due to a stroke.http://news.wbfo.org/post/legendary-broadcaster-van-miller-has-died Miller suffered various complications due to old age in his last years. Most of his estate was auctioned off in February 2017, including a large collection of football memorabilia (Miller received, for instance, championship rings as a member of the Bills staff for every AFL and AFC championship in which the team appeared); he also owned a Maserati.http://wivb.com/2017/02/10/van- millers-collection-of-auction-items-well-received/ ReferencesExternal links * Van Miller/Buffalo Braves photos & audio from Steve Cichon's staffannouncer.com Category:1927 births Category:2015 deaths Category:American Football League announcers Category:American radio sports announcers Category:Association football commentators Category:Minor League Baseball broadcasters Category:Buffalo Bills broadcasters Category:Buffalo Braves broadcasters Category:Buffalo Bulls football broadcasters Category:College basketball announcers in the United States Category:College football announcers Category:High school basketball announcers in the United States Category:High school football announcers in the United States Category:National Basketball Association broadcasters Category:National Football League announcers Category:Television personalities from Buffalo, New York Category:Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award recipients Category:Radio personalities from Buffalo, New York Category:University at Buffalo alumni Category:People from Dunkirk, New York ","title":"Van Miller"},{"id":"2301776","text":"BZO may refer to: * Bolzano Airport, with IATA code BZO * Alliance for the Future of Austria, abbreviated BZ√ñ * Bozaba language, a Bantu language of the Democratic Republic of the Congo ","title":"BZO"},{"id":"2301786","text":"Sekolah Pelita Harapan (SPH) is a private Christian international school with five campuses in Jakarta, Indonesia.

Regarded as the Dean of American jazz bass players,\\"nyt\\" his nicknames included \\"Sporty\\" from his years in Chicago, \\"Fump\\" from his time on the road with Cab Calloway, and \\"The Judge\\" from the 1950s and beyond. Hinton's recording career lasted over 60 years, mostly in jazz but also with a variety of other genres as a prolific session musician. He was also a photographer of note, praised for documenting American jazz during the 20th Century. Biography= Early life in Mississippi (1910‚Äì1919) = Hinton was born in Vicksburg, Mississippi, the only child of Hilda Gertrude Robinson, whom he referred to as \\"Titter,\\" and Milton Dixon Hinton. He was three-months-old when his father left the family. He grew up in a home with his mother, his maternal grandmother (whom he referred to as \\"Mama\\"), and two of his mother's sisters. His childhood in Vicksburg was characterized by extreme poverty and extreme racism. Lynching was a common practice at the time. Hinton said that one of the clearest memories of his childhood was when he accidentally came upon a lynching. = Growing up in Chicago (1919‚Äì1935) = Milt Hinton from his high school yearbook (1930), from the Milton J. and Mona C. Hinton Collection, Oberlin Conservatory Library special collections Hinton moved with his extended family to Chicago, Illinois, in the fall of 1919, which created opportunities for him. Chicago was where Hinton first encountered economic diversity among African-Americans, about which he later noted, \\"That's when I realized that being black didn't always mean you had to be poor.\\" It was also where he experienced an abundance of music, either in person or through live performances on the radio. During this time he first heard concerts featuring Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Fletcher Henderson, Earl Hines, Eddie South, and many others. Music was a fixture at home. His mother and other relatives regularly played piano. He received his first instrument ‚Äì a violin ‚Äì in 1923 for his thirteenth birthday. In addition to taking lessons on the violin, Hinton and his mother attended performances at the Vendome Theater every Sunday, featuring the orchestra of Erskine Tate with Louis Armstrong as a feature soloist. While attending Wendell Phillips High School, he played violin in the school orchestra and learned peck horn in order to play in the school's ROTC marching band that was directed by Major N. Clark Smith. He soon transitioned from peck horn to bass saxophone and then to tuba, while also being accepted into the citywide brass band sponsored by The Chicago Defender, where he played with Lionel Hampton. After graduating from high school, Hinton attended Crane Junior College for two years, during which time he began receiving regular work as a freelance musician around Chicago. He performed with Freddie Keppard, Zutty Singleton, Jabbo Smith, Erskine Tate, and Art Tatum. His first steady job began in the spring of 1930, playing tuba (and later double bass) in the band of pianist Tiny Parham. His recording debut on November 4, 1930 was on tuba with Parham's band on a tune titled \\"Squeeze Me.\\" After graduating from Crane Junior College in 1932, attended Northwestern University for one semester, then dropped out to pursue music full-time. He received steady work from 1932 through 1935 in a quartet with violinist Eddie South, with extended residencies in California, Chicago, and Detroit. With this group he first recorded on double bass in the spring of 1933. = The Cab Calloway era (1936‚Äì1950) = Paystub from Cab Calloway to Milt Hinton (1947), from the Milton J. and Mona C. Hinton Collection, Oberlin Conservatory Library special collections In 1936, Hinton joined the Cab Calloway Orchestra, initially as a temporary replacement for Al Morgan while the band was on tour en route to a six-month residency at the newly opened midtown location of the Cotton Club in New York City. He quickly found acceptance among the band members, and he ended up staying with Calloway for over fifteen years. Until the Cotton Club closed in 1940, the Calloway band would perform there for up to six months per year, going on tour for the remaining six months of the year. During the Cotton Club residencies, Hinton took part in recording sessions with Benny Goodman, Lionel Hampton, Billie Holiday, Ethel Waters, Teddy Wilson, and many others. It was at this time that he recorded what is possibly the first bass feature, \\"Pluckin' the Bass\\" in August 1939. Hinton appeared regularly on radio while in Calloway's band, either on bass in concerts broadcast from the Cotton Club, or as a cast member for the short-lived music quiz show \\"Cab Calloway's Quizzicale.\\" These broadcasts brought national attention to the Calloway band and helped enable the successful national tours the band would schedule. They also gave listeners a chance to hear examples of jive talk, which Calloway would formalize through publications such as his Hepster's Dictionary, first published in 1938. Calloway's band included renowned sidemen such as Danny Barker, Chu Berry, Doc Cheatham, Cozy Cole, Dizzy Gillespie, Illinois Jacquet, Jonah Jones, Ike Quebec, and Ben Webster. Hinton credits Chu Berry with elevating the overall musicianship of the Calloway band in part by encouraging Cab to hire arrangers such as Benny Carter to create new arrangements that would challenge the musicians. As Hinton put it, \\"Musically he was the greatest thing that ever happened to the band.\\" Hinton was also heavily influenced by the musical innovations of Dizzy Gillespie, with whom he had informal sessions in the late 1930s during breaks between sets at the Cotton Club. Hinton credits Gillespie with introducing him to many of the experimental harmonic practices and chord substitutions that would later be associated with bebop. In 1939 when Hinton returned to Chicago for his grandmother's funeral, he met Mona Clayton, who was then singing in his mother's church choir. The two were married a few years later and remained inseparable for the rest of Milt's life. (Mona was his second wife; the first was a brief relationship in the 1930s with Oby Allen, a friend he knew from high school.) He and Mona's only child, Charlotte, was born on February 28, 1947. Mona had begun traveling with the Calloway Orchestra in the early 1940s‚Äîthe only musician's friend or spouse to do so. She helped musicians in the band manage their money, and she often insisted that they open savings accounts. For band members, she was a trusted confidant who was known for her discretion. When traveling with a toddler became too difficult, the Hintons bought a two-family house in Queens, and ten years later they purchased a larger single-family home in an adjacent neighborhood where they remained for the rest of their lives. In addition to caring for their daughter, Mona handled the family's finances, and her attention to detail ensured the couple's financial security later in life. She kept track of Hinton's freelance work, scheduled interviews, coordinated public relations events, and often drove him back and forth to gigs (Hinton never drove as an adult, due in part to a car accident he was involved in as a teenager in Chicago). In the mid 1960s, Mona completed both a bachelor's and a master's degree and taught in the public schools for several years. In the 1970s, she began traveling with Hinton again and was regularly invited to join him at jazz parties and festivals where he performed. At the same time, she was active as a music contractor for Lena Horne and others. Mona was always well respected in the jazz community, and she and Hinton were viewed by many as role models; as the jazz historian Dan Morgenstern noted in an article from 2000, \\"If there is a closer couple, I'd be surprised.\\" = After Cab Calloway (1950‚Äì1954) = By 1950, popular music tastes had changed, and Calloway lacked the funds to support a full big band. Instead, he hired Hinton and a few others to create a smaller ensemble, first a septet and later a quartet, which toured until June 1952, with trips to Cuba and Uruguay. After the Calloway ensemble disbanded, Hinton spent more time as a freelance studio musician in New York City. At first, the work was sporadic, and, as Hinton put it, \\"This was the one period in my life when I was worried about earning a living.\\" He played as many clubs and restaurants as possible, a practice he would continue for the next several decades. He performed regularly at La Vie en Rose, the Embers, the Metropole, and Basin Street West, where he appeared with Jackie Gleason, Phil Moore, and Joe Bushkin. In the early 1950s, he performed with Count Basie for a brief time in the New York area. Although his freelance work was increasing, in July 1953 Hinton signed a one-year contract to tour with Louis Armstrong. He described the decision as \\"very difficult\\" as it would force him to be away from his family, and it would also slow down the momentum he was gaining as a freelance musician in New York City. Steady pay and the opportunity to perform with Armstrong were persuasive, and Hinton performed dozens of concerts, including a tour of Japan, as a member of the band. When an opportunity to join the house band for a television show hosted by Robert Q. Lewis in New York opened up in February 1954, Hinton gave his notice to Armstrong and returned to Queens. = In the studios (1954‚Äì1970) = For roughly the next two decades he performed regularly on numerous radio and television programs, including those hosted by Jackie Gleason, Robert Q. Lewis, Galen Drake, Patti Page, Polly Bergen, Teddy Wilson, Mitch Miller, Dick Cavett, and others. As he recalled, \\"I had a great situation because I was never on staff. That meant I'd get paid by the show. And since I never spent more than fifteen hours a week on rehearsals and shows, I always had free time to do record dates.\\" Milt Hinton's datebook (1959), from the Milton J. and Mona C. Hinton Collection, Oberlin Conservatory Library special collections By far, his most regular work during this era was in the recording studio, where Milt was among the first African-Americans to be regularly hired for studio contract work. From the mid-1950s through the early 1970s he contributed to thousands of jazz and popular records as well as hundreds of jingles and film soundtracks. He would regularly play on three three-hour studio sessions per day, requiring him to own multiple basses that he hired assistants to transport from one studio to the next. During this era Milt recorded with everyone from Billie Holiday to Paul McCartney, Frank Sinatra to Leon Redbone, and Sam Cooke to Barbra Streisand. As Hinton summarized his time in the studios, \\"I might be on a date for Andre Kostelanetz in the morning, do one with Brook Benton or Johnny Mathis in the afternoon, and then finish up the day with Paul Anka or Bobby Rydell. At one time or another, I probably played for just about every popular artist around in those days.\\" Starting in the mid-1950s, he regularly worked in the studio with Hank Jones (piano), Barry Galbraith (guitar), and Osie Johnson (drums) in a group that informally became known as the New York Rhythm Section. The four played on hundreds of sessions together and even recorded an LP in 1956 that was titled The Rhythm Section. = After the studios (1970‚Äì2000) = Ad for 1970 performance of the New York Bass Violin Choir, from the Milton J. and Mona C. Hinton Collection, Oberlin Conservatory Library special collections By the late 1960s studio work began dropping off, so Hinton incorporated more live performances into his schedule. He regularly accepted club gigs, most often at Michael's Pub, Zinno's, and the Rainbow Room where he performed with Benny Goodman, Johnny Hartman, Dick Hyman, Red Norvo, Teddy Wilson, and others. He also went back on the road, first with Diahann Carroll for a tour in Paris in 1966, and later with Paul Anka, Barbra Streisand, Pearl Bailey, and Bing Crosby. From the 1960s through the 1990s he traveled extensively to Europe, Canada, South America, Japan, the Soviet Union, and the Middle East, while also appearing throughout the U.S. In 1968 he began performing as a part of Professionals Unlimited (later renamed the New York Bass Violin Choir), a collective bass ensemble organized by Bill Lee that included Lisle Atkinson, Ron Carter, Richard Davis, Michael Fleming, Percy Heath, and Sam Jones. The group performed irregularly for a number of years and in 1980 released a self-titled album on the Strata-East label (SES-8003) containing material recorded between 1969 and 1975. Hinton taught for nearly twenty years as a visiting professor of jazz studies at Hunter College and Baruch College, first offering a jazz workshop at Hunter in the fall of 1973. During this time he regularly appeared at jazz festivals, parties, and cruises; performing annually at Dick Gibson's jazz parties in Colorado, the Odessa and Midland jazz parties in Texas beginning in 1967, and Don and Sue Miller's jazz parties in Phoenix and Scottsdale. He played at the first Newport Jazz Festival in 1954 and was a regular at Newport and other jazz festivals produced by George Wein throughout the next four decades. He was a favorite at the Bern Jazz Festival in Switzerland, sponsored by Hans Zurbruegg and Marianne Gauer. In 1977 he recorded with Earl Hines and Lionel Hampton. For much of the 1980s and 1990s Hinton was featured on jazz cruises organized by Hank O'Neal, then owner of Chiaroscuro Records. Honorary Doctorate awarded to Milt Hinton by William Patterson College (1987), from the Milton J. and Mona C. Hinton Collection, Oberlin Conservatory Library special collections By the 1990s, he was revered as an elder statesman in jazz, and he was regularly honored with significant awards and accolades. He received honorary doctorates from William Paterson College, Skidmore College, Hamilton College, DePaul University, Trinity College, the Berklee College of Music, Fairfield University, and Baruch College of the City University of New York. He won the Eubie Award from the New York Chapter of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, the Living Treasure Award from the Smithsonian Institution, and he was the first recipient of the Three Keys Award in Bern, Switzerland. In 1993, he was awarded the highly prestigious National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master Fellowship. He also contributed to the NEA's Jazz Oral History Program, continuing a longstanding practice of recording interviews with friends in his basement during extended visits. In 1996 he received a New York State Governor's Arts Award, in March 1998 he was awarded the Artist Achievement Award by the Governor of Mississippi, and in 2000 his name was installed on ASCAP's Wall of Fame. In 1990, Hinton's 80th year, WRTI- FM in Philadelphia produced a series of twenty-eight short programs in which he chronicled his life. These were aired nationwide by more than one hundred fifty public radio stations and received a Gabriel Award that year as Best National Short Feature. In the same year George Wein produced a concert as a part of the JVC Jazz Festival in honor of Hinton's 80th birthday. Similar concerts were produced for his 85th and 90th birthdays. By 1996, he ceased performing on bass, due to a number of physical ailments, and he died at the age of 90 on December 19, 2000.  Musicianship  Hinton was broadly regarded as a consummate sideman, possessing a sensitivity for appropriately applying his formidable technique and his extensive harmonic knowledge to the performance at hand. He was equally adept at bowing, pizzicato, and \\"slapping,\\" a technique for which he first became famous while playing with the Cab Calloway Orchestra early in his career. He was also an accomplished sight-reader, a skill which he developed on the road with Calloway and honed during his several decades of studio work. As he described his technical diversity, \\"Working with Cab for sixteen years could have made me stale. You play the same music over and over, and after awhile you can do it in your sleep. Many guys liked it that way because it was easy. But when the band business got bad, they weren‚Äôt prepared to do anything else. On the other hand, I was able to work on radio and TV and get all kinds of record dates. In a real way, practicing and discipline paid off.\\"  Hinton Photographic Collection  Hinton received his first camera, a 35mm Argus C3, on his 25th birthday in 1935. He later moved on to a Leica, then a Canon 35mm range- finder, and by the 1960s to a Nikon F. Between 1935 and 1999 Hinton took thousands of photographs, approximately 60,000 of which now comprise the Milton J. Hinton Photographic Collection, co-directed by David G. Berger and Holly Maxson. The Collection includes 35mm black and white negatives and color transparencies, reference and exhibition-quality prints, and photographs given to and collected by Hinton throughout his life. The work depicts an extensive range of jazz artists and popular performers in varied settings - on the road, in recording studios, at parties, and at home - over a period of six decades. Beginning in the early 1960s, Hinton and Berger worked together to organize the photographs and identify the subjects of the photos. In June 1981, Hinton had his first one-person photographic exhibition in Philadelphia, and since then items from the Collection have been featured in dozens of exhibits across the country and in Europe. Photographs from the Collection have also regularly appeared in periodicals, calendars, postcards, CD liner notes, films, and books. Hinton and Berger co-wrote Bass Line: The Stories and Photographs of Milt Hinton (Temple University Press, 1988), and with the addition of Holly Maxson, the three co-wrote OverTime: The Jazz Photographs of Milt Hinton (Pomegranate Art Books, 1991) and Playing the Changes: Milt Hinton‚Äôs Life in Stories and Photographs (Vanderbilt University Press, 2008). Notable documentary films that have drawn upon the Collection include The Long Night of Lady Day (Billie Holiday), The Brute and the Beautiful (Ben Webster), and Listen Up (Quincy Jones). A Great Day in Harlem, a 1994 documentary about Esquire's photographic shoot of jazz legends in 1958, features numerous photographs by Milt as well as a home movie shot by Mona. In late 2002 Berger and Maxson utilized the Collection along with a number of original interviews with Hinton's friends and colleagues to produce the documentary film Keeping Time: The Life, Music & Photographs of Milt Hinton. It debuted at the London Film Festival, won the Audience Award at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2003, and has been shown at film festivals both domestically and abroad. Hinton Collection at Oberlin College  In 1980, in honor of Hinton's 70th birthday, his friends and associates worked to create the Milton J. Hinton Scholarship Fund, which was used to help support the musical studies of a variety of bass students over the next 35 years. In 2014 the fund was transferred to Oberlin College to provide scholarships to students attending the biennial Milton J. Hinton Summer Institute for Studio Bass, established at Oberlin College in 2014 and directed by Peter Dominguez, Professor of Jazz Studies and Double Bass at Oberlin. The institute is one component of a broader relationship between the Hinton Estate and Oberlin, which also includes: * the acquisition by Oberlin of four of Hinton's basses, including the 18th-century bass that Hinton performed on for the majority of his career; * the presence of the Milton J. and Mona C. Hinton Collection in the Oberlin Conservatory Library special collections, which comprises materials created or compiled by Milt and Mona Hinton over the course of their lives. The Collection includes date books, correspondence, financial records, artifacts, newspaper clippings, photographs, audio and moving image materials, and other ephemera that provide an unrivalled view of Hinton's life; * an exhibition in 2014 at the Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin College of 99 of Hinton's photographs, several dozen of which are now a part of the AMAM's permanent collection. This relationship is in line with Hinton's longstanding goal to educate and inspire future generations of musicians. As he noted when discussing one of his own bass teachers, \\"For [Dmitri Shmuklovsky], passing on his skill and knowledge to the next generation was a solemn duty. It was a mission that went beyond his music. And looking back, I know his greatest gift was to teach me this strong sense of responsibility. It's the reason I've always tried to help young people. If someone wants to improve, if they have a sincere desire to learn, I've always tried to be there to give them whatever I can.\\" The multifaceted relationship between the Hinton Estate and Oberlin College will ensure that Milt and Mona's legacy will be passed on to future generations.

R. Martin. It involves a far-future priest of the One True Interstellar Catholic Church of Earth and the Thousand Worlds (with similarities to the Roman Catholic hierarchy) investigating a sect that reveres Judas Iscariot. The story deals with the nature and limitations of religious faith. The story originally appeared in the June 1979 issue of Omni. In 1980, it won the Hugo Award for Best Short Story as well as the Locus Award for best short story. It is set in the same fictional \\"Thousand Worlds\\" universe as several of Martin's other works, including Dying of the Light, Sandkings, Nightflyers, A Song for Lya and the stories collected in Tuf Voyaging. Plot summary Damien Har Veris ‚Äî a priest skilled in resolving heretical disputes efficiently, although now spiritually exhausted ‚Äî is sent by his alien archbishop as Knight Inquisitor to deal with a particular sect that has made a saint of Judas Iscariot. The sect follows a religious text, The Way of Cross and Dragon, that radically revises the life of Iscariot and his place in Christianity. The text describes how, born of a prostitute, Iscariot mastered the dark arts to become a tamer of dragons and the ruler of a great empire. After torturing and maiming Christ, Iscariot repented and relinquished his empire to become the penitent Legs of Christ, the first and best-beloved of the Twelve Apostles. Returning from proselytizing to find Christ crucified, an enraged Iscariot then destroyed the perpetrating empire and strangled St. Peter for renouncing Christ, only to discover, too late, Christ's Resurrection. Rejecting Judas' violence, Christ restored St. Peter to life and gave him the keys of the kingdom. St. Peter then suppressed the truth about Judas, vilifying his name and exploits. Seeking redemption for his wrath, Iscariot became the thousand-year-old Wandering Jew, before finally rejoining Christ in the Kingdom of God. Perusing the materials of the sect, Har Veris finds himself enjoying the fanciful, creative but ultimately ridiculous narrative, finding it far more interesting than the more mundane heresies that have developed around power, money and doctrinal quibbles. Arriving on the sect's distant planet on board his ship, the Truth of Christ, Har Veris confronts its heresiarch, Lukyan Judasson, creator of the Way of Cross and Dragon narrative, but finds that he is already expected. Questioning Judasson, Har Veris uncovers a conspiracy of nihilistic Liars, who see Truth as entropy and despair, and who wish to soften and color the ultimately meaningless lives of others by creating belief in carefully crafted Lies. In essence, they create faiths. They have perpetrated this Judas cult as well as others, and now want Har Veris to join them. Despite his own spiritual exhaustion, he realizes that, though he may be losing his faith, he has not lost his passion for truth. When he refuses to join the Liars, Judasson wishes to have him silenced, but his senior in the conspiracy, a misshapen psionic mutant, senses the impending Liar in Har Veris, and allows him to go. Har Veris then uses political manipulation and the public's fear and distrust of psychic powers to turn the tide on the Judas cult, resolving yet another heresy with dispatch. When, much later, he fully acknowledges that he has lost his faith, his superior is indifferent: results are what is needed, and Har Veris is to continue in his role as inquisitor. The priest accepts this, realizing that the psychic was right: he is himself a consummate Liar, perpetuating a faith in which he no longer believes. However, departing on his next Inquisition, he has named his new starship Dragon. See also * Gospel of Judas Footnotes Category:Short stories by George R. R.

He is the protagonist of many mystery novels set in and around the town of Ystad, south-east of the city of Malm√∂, in the southern province of Scania. Wallander has been portrayed on screen by the actors Rolf Lassg√•rd, Krister Henriksson, Sir Kenneth Branagh and Adam P√•lsson. Biography Wallander is said to live on Mariagatan in Ystad. As a young police officer, he was nearly killed when a drunk whom he was questioning stabbed him with a butcher's knife (this is mentioned in the account of his first case). Wallander was once married, but his wife Mona left him and he has since had a difficult relationship with his rebellious only child, Linda, who barely survived a suicide attempt when she was fifteen. He also had issues with his late father, an artist who painted the same landscape 7,000 times for a living; the elder Wallander strongly disapproved of his son's decision to join the police force and frequently derided him for it. Wallander is a great fan of the opera; while in his car he regularly listens to recordings of famous opera singers such as Maria Callas, and when he can find the time goes to opera performances, sometimes crossing over to Copenhagen, Denmark for this purpose. At one time, Wallander had dreamed of making opera his life, leaving the police force and becoming the impresario of his friend, Sten Wid√©n, a tenor who aspired to sing opera. But Wid√©n's voice was not good enough and the dream came to naught‚Äîa crushing disappointment in Wallander's life (as in Wid√©n's). Inspector Wallander has few close friends and is known for his less-than-desirable lifestyle; he consumes too much alcohol and junk food, exercises very little, and sometimes struggles with anger. He frequently regards the crimes he investigates on a very personal level, throwing himself into catching criminals and going against the orders of his superiors to try to solve a case, often with negative effects on his emotional stability. Over the years he has grown increasingly disillusioned with his work and often wonders whether he should have become a police officer at all. He was once falsely sued and harassed for police brutality and still lives with the guilt of having shot and killed a man in the fog, an act which drove him into depression and nearly led to his resignation. His relationships with his colleagues are tentative; they are alternately amazed by his intellect and frustrated by his brusque manner and aggressive tactics. He is frequently at loose ends socially and with his family. After the breakup of his marriage, he had an affair with Annette Brolin, the prosecutor with whom he was working on some cases ‚Äî but she was married and had children, and would not consider divorcing for his sake (\\"Faceless Killers\\"). In later years, he maintains a somewhat inconsistent romantic relationship with Baiba Liepa, a woman in Riga, Latvia, whom he met while investigating a murder there, until it eventually dissolves. Over the course of the series he is diagnosed with diabetes, and towards the end of his career he suffers from memory lapses, discovering he has developed Alzheimer's disease, with which his father was also afflicted.  Novels  The following Kurt Wallander novels have been translated into English. They are listed in the order that they were originally published in Sweden: #M√∂rdare utan ansikte (1991; English translation by Steven T.

English translation by Laurie Thompson: An Event in Autumn, 2014) #Den orolige mannen (2009; English translation by Laurie Thompson: The Troubled Man, 2011) The following novel features Wallander's daughter Linda in the lead, while he is a secondary character: *Innan frosten (2002; English translation by Ebba Segerberg: Before the Frost, 2005) It was intended as the first of a spinoff trilogy. However Mankell was so distraught after the suicide of Johanna S√§llstr√∂m, the actress playing the character at the time in the Swedish TV series, that he decided to abandon the series after only the first novel. The order that the novels occur in the timeline of the series is shown below (with the title of the English translation shown in parentheses). Note that there is some overlap in the timeline among the novels as there are three separate series. # Pyramiden (The Pyramid) # M√∂rdare utan ansikte (Faceless Killers) # Hundarna i Riga (The Dogs of Riga) # Den vita lejoninnan (The White Lioness) # Mannen som log (The Man Who Smiled) # Villosp√•r (Sidetracked) # Den femte kvinnan (The Fifth Woman) # Steget efter (One Step Behind) # Brandv√§gg (Firewall) # Innan frosten (Before the Frost) # Handen (An Event in Autumn) # Den orolige mannen (The Troubled Man)  TV and film =Film series (Swedish)= Between 1994 and 2007, all nine Wallander novels published at the time were made into films in Sweden starring Rolf Lassg√•rd as Wallander:    =TV series (Swedish)= Krister Henriksson, who portrays Wallander in the Swedish TV series, pictured at the 48th Guldbagge Awards From 2005 to 2006, 13 new stories, starring Krister Henriksson as Kurt Wallander and Johanna S√§llstr√∂m as Linda Wallander, were produced. The first film, based on Before the Frost, was released in cinemas. The rest are original stories not based on any of Mankell's books, and were released on DVD, with the exception of Mastermind which was also released in cinemas. * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * . * .

Yellow Bird announced in March 2008 that 13 new Swedish language Wallander films were to be made with Krister Henriksson. Production started in 2008. These new films were to have a more political slant than the previous films starring Henriksson. The first production in the second series, , was given a cinematic launch in Sweden on 9 January 2009 before being released on DVD.

The series stars Kenneth Branagh as Wallander. The episodes have not been filmed in the order in which the original novels were published, resulting in changes to the backstories of the lead characters in the films. The first series consisted of the novels Sidetracked, Firewall and One Step Behind. These three were shot on location in Ystad in the summer of 2008, with a combined budget of ¬£6 million ($12 million). They aired in late 2008 on the BBC. A second series of Wallander adaptations was commissioned by the BBC from the same production team in 2008. Broadcast in January 2010, the second series was composed of adaptations of Faceless Killers, The Man Who Smiled, and The Fifth Woman. The third series began shooting in Ystad and Riga, Latvia in the Summer of 2011 and continued into the winter. Broadcast in July 2012, it consists of adaptations of An Event in Autumn, The Dogs of Riga and Before the Frost. While the novel Before the Frost has Wallander's daughter Linda as its protagonist detective, the story was adapted for television so that Wallander himself became the lead. The BBC Wallander series concluded in May 2016 with a three-episode fourth series consisting of an adaptation of The White Lioness and a two-episode adaptation of Mankell's final Wallander novel, The Troubled Man.. = Netflix TV series = In November 2018 it was announced that Netflix and Yellow Bird UK were producing a TV series based on the Kurt Wallander character and titled Young Wallander, and a 2019 release date was announced for the six-part series. The series explores the life of Kurt Wallander as a young man, before the events of the books. On September 11, 2019 it was announced that filming had begun on the Young Wallander series. The series stars Adam P√•lsson, Richard Dillane, Leanne Best, Ellise Chappell, and Yasen Atour. The series is directed by Ole Endresen and Jens Jonsson, and written by Ben Harris. =Special appearances= Mankell's friend and writer Jan Guillou used Kurt Wallander in the 10th book of his Carl Hamilton-series . Guillou and Mankell also co-wrote the Swedish crime-drama mini series Talismanen and here we also encounter Kurt Wallander as a supporting character, this time portrayed by actor Lennart J√§hkel.

In churches which use the Byzantine Rite, the Trisagion is chanted immediately before the Prokeimenon and the Epistle reading. It is also included in a set of prayers named for it, called the Trisagion Prayers, which forms part of numerous services (the Hours, Vespers, Matins, and as part of the opening prayers for most services). It is most prominent in the Latin Church for its use on Good Friday, and is also used in the Liturgy of Hours and in some Catholic devotions.  Form of the prayer  :For other languages, please see the section below The Trisagion prayer is an ancient prayer in Christianity. In Greek: :·ºçŒ≥ŒπŒøœÇ ·ΩÅ ŒòŒµœåœÇ, ·ºçŒ≥ŒπŒøœÇ ·º∞œÉœáœÖœÅœåœÇ, ·ºçŒ≥ŒπŒøœÇ ·ºÄŒ∏Œ¨ŒΩŒ±œÑŒøœÇ, ·ºêŒªŒ≠Œ∑œÉŒøŒΩ ·º°Œº·æ∂œÇ. :H√°gios ho The√≥s, H√°gios ischyr√≥s, H√°gios ath√°natos, el√©ƒìson hƒìm√¢s. (Traditional Romanization) In Latin: :Sanctus Deus, Sanctus Fortis, Sanctus Immortalis, miserere nobis. In English - Literal Translation: :Holy God, Holy Strong, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us. In English - Common Liturgical Translation: :Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us. In Aramaic: ‹©‹ï‹ù‹´‹ê ‹ê‹†‹ó‹êÿå ‹©‹ï‹ù‹´‹ê ‹ö‹ù‹†‹¨‹¢‹êÿå ‹©‹ï‹ù‹´‹ê ‹†‹ê ‹°‹ù‹ò‹¨‹êÿå ‹™‹ö‹° ‹•‹†‹ù‹¢ Qadishat aloho, qadishat hailtono, qadishat lo moyouto.  History = Traditional origins = An Icon of Christ the Ancient of Days fresco Ubisi, Georgia The Greek phrase Trisagion translates as \\"Thrice Holy\\" ‚Äì as in this hymn God is described as holy in three different qualities; Agios o Theos means \\"Holy God\\". The hymn is of great antiquity, and perhaps much older than the event assigned by the Greek Menology as connected to its origin. The tradition recounts that during the reign of Theodosius II (408-450) Constantinople was shaken by a violent earthquake, 24 September, and that whilst the people, the emperor and the Patriarch Proclus of Constantinople (434-446) were praying for heavenly assistance, a child was suddenly lifted into midair, to whom all cried out Kyrie eleison ('Lord, have mercy'). The child was then seen to descend again to the earth, and in a loud voice he exhorted the people to pray : 'Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal'. After giving this exhortation, the child died. The hymn was one of the exclamations of the fathers at the Council of Chalcedon (451), and is common not only to all the Greek Oriental liturgies but was used also in the Gallican Liturgy (see Saint Germain of Paris, d. 576), which shows that the hymn is ancient. Some believe it is extremely ancient, perhaps of apostolic-era origin. However this goes against the menology tradition regarding its origin. The Coptic Orthodox Church and Armenian Apostolic Church believe that the Trisagion originated from Nicodemus. While taking the body of Christ off the cross with Joseph of Arimathea, Nicodemus saw Jesus Christ's eyes open and then shouted \\"Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal\\". Traditionally, it is also considered proof that his Divinity did not part from his humanity. = Greek and Latin = The Gallican Liturgy refers to it as being sung both in Greek and in Latin: Incipiente pr√¶sule ecclesia Ajus [that is, Agios] psallit, dicens latinum cum gr√¶co, as also previously in Greek alone, before the Prophetia. Benedict XIV thought that the Greek formula was joined with the Latin in allusion to the divine voice heard at Constantinople. But the explanation seems hardly necessary, in view of the retention of Kyrie eleison in the Roman Liturgy, as well as such Hebrew words as Amen, Alleluia, Hosanna, Sabaoth. It is true that the Kyrie eleison is not joined to a Latin version; on the other hand, it is so simple and occurs so frequently, that its meaning could easily be learned and remembered ‚Äì whereas the entire Trisagion might well receive a parallel version into Latin. = Modifications in history = Various additions or modifications made to the Trisagion at certain points in history have been the subject of considerable controversy. According to Pseudo- Zacharias Rhetor, the phrase 'who wast crucified for us' was added to it by Eustathius of Antioch to combat the Arians, although this is dismissed by some scholars. It was more likely written during the time of Peter the Fuller who enforced its use as a sort of \\"test of orthodoxy against Nestorianism\\". Those who understood the hymn as being addressed to the Trinity (such as John of Damascus) censured Peter for propagating the teaching of the Theopaschites. Emperor Anastasius I's attempt to adopt the addition in 512 at Constantinople resulted in a riot. Whether the Trisagion is to be understood as addressed to the Holy Trinity or addressed to God the Son has been a matter of contention, particularly between those who approved of the council of Chalcedon and those who were against it. But, in light of widespread adoption of the hymn with the above addition ('who wast crucified for us'), Calandion, Bishop of Antioch, sought to allay the controversy surrounding it by prefixing the words 'Christ, King'. This had the effect of making the hymn refer directly to the incarnate Word: Holy God, Holy and Strong, Holy and Immortal, Christ, King, who was crucified for us, have mercy on us. Though perhaps well intended, this effort at emendation was ultimately rejected. Later Severus, who was the Non- Chalcedonian Patriarch of Antioch, wrote to prove the correct ascription of the hymn to the Son of God, and made the use of the emended version standard in his diocese. The eighty-first canon of the Council of Trullo anathematized anyone who allows the Trisagion to be modified by adding \\"who was crucified for us\\" or any other modification.See also In the eleventh century, Pope Gregory VII (1073‚Äì1085) wrote to the Armenians, who still used the emended formula, instructing them to avoid all occasion for scandal by removing the additions, which Pope Gregory argues (incorrectly) that neither the Roman nor any Eastern Church (save the Armenians themselves) had adopted. The injunction appears to have been ignored. When, centuries later, Roman Catholic union with the Armenians was again discussed, a question was addressed (30 January 1635) to the Congregatio de Propaganda Fide as to whether the Armenian Catholics might still use the formula 'who suffered for us'. The request was answered in the negative. Nevertheless, Armenian Catholic continue to use the traditional formula. Variations of the traditional formula and Trinitarian ascription are found also in the Armenian Orthodox Liturgy. In these the hymn is addressed to the Redeemer, and versions vary with the feast or office. Thus, the formula of Peter the Fuller (above) is used on all Fridays; on all Sundays: 'risen from the dead'; on Holy Thursday: 'betrayed for us'; on Holy Saturday: 'buried for us'; on the Feast of the Dormition of the Theotokos: 'who came to the death of the Holy Mother and Virgin'; on the feasts of the Holy Cross: 'who was crucified for us'; for the celebration of marriages: 'who took flesh for us', etc. The Coptic Orthodox, Syriac Orthodox, Malankara Orthodox and other Oriental Orthodox Churches also use the formula 'crucified for us', with minor seasonal variations from the Armenian use.  Usage = In the Divine Liturgy = When the Trisagion is sung during the Divine Liturgy of the Byzantine Rite, before the Prokeimenon of the Gospel that precedes the Epistle reading, it is normally sung three times to one of many melodies composed for it. This is followed by singing Glory... Now..., the second half of the Trisagion once, and finally the whole Trisagion a fourth time: :Holy God, Holy [and] Mighty, Holy [and] Immortal, have mercy on us. :Holy God, Holy [and] Mighty, Holy [and] Immortal, Have mercy on us. :Holy God, Holy [and] Mighty, Holy [and] Immortal, Have mercy on us. :Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, both now and ever and to the ages of ages. Amen. :Holy and Immortal, have mercy on us. :Holy God, Holy and Mighty, Holy and Immortal, Have mercy on us. On the other hand, in the usage of the other, non-Byzantine Eastern Churches, the Trisagion is simply sung thrice, with no Glory... Now.... In the East Syriac Rite, used by the Assyrian Church of the East and Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, the Trisagion is sung towards the beginning of the Holy Qurbana, before the Old Testament Readings. In the West Syriac Rite, used by the Syriac Orthodox Church, Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian Church, Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, the Syriac Catholic Church, Syro-Malankara Catholic Church and in a hybrid form, the Maronite Church and other derived rites of Syriac Christianity, the Trisagion is sung towards the beginning of the Holy Qurbana (Divine Liturgy), after the Old Testament Readings and the Introductory Hymn. In the Armenian Rite, used by the Armenian Orthodox Church and the Armenian Catholic Church, the Trisagion occurs early in the Divine Liturgy, coming after the troparion of the Monogenes (Only-begotten Son) and the Midday first Antiphon. The choir sings the Trisagion during the lesser entrance of the Gospel Books. The Trisagion also has a similar place in the liturgies of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, as well as the Coptic Catholic Church and the Ethiopic Catholic Church. = As part of the Trisagion Prayers = During most services of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Trisagion is combined with several other prayers to form a unit, often called simply the Trisagion Prayers. This set of prayers forms part of the opening prayers of most services, and is also located within many of the Hours and daily cycle of services. The full version normally looks like this: :Holy God, Holy [and] Mighty, Holy [and] Immortal, have mercy on us. (three times) :Glory... Both now... :All-holy Trinity, have mercy on us. Lord, cleanse us from our sins. Master, pardon our iniquities. Holy God, visit and heal us for thy Name's sake. :Lord, have mercy. (three times) :Glory... Both now... :Our Father... While it is possible that the Trisagion has origins in the Biblical 'thrice holy' of Isaiah 6:3 (the Sanctus: Holy, holy, holy, Lord of Sabaoth. Heaven and earth are full of your glory', etc.), they are today separate prayers. The latter is used at a different point in the Liturgy (in the Divine Liturgy, during the anaphora). The trisagion is also sung at the entry of the coffin into the church at a funeral and when the coffin is carried to the grave.Parry (1999), p. 498 It is also sung at the conclusion of the Great Doxology.Parry (1999), p. 166 = In the Latin liturgy = In the Latin Church, the main regular use of the Trisagion is on Good Friday, when it is sung during the ceremony of the Adoration of the Cross. In the Sistine Chapel, the traditional setting was the polyphonic musical setting of Palestrina. During this service, the hymn is sung by two choirs, alternately in Greek and Latin, originally two antiphonal Greek and Latin choirs, as follows: :Greek (First) Choir: √Ågios o Theos. (Holy God) :Latin (Second) Choir: Sanctus Deus. :Greek (First) Choir: √Ågios √≠schyros. (Holy Strong One) :Latin (Second) Choir: Sanctus fortis. :Greek (First) Choir: √Ågios ath√°natos, el√©ison imas. (Holy Immortal One, have mercy on us) :Latin (Second) Choir: Sanctus immort√°lis, miser√©re nobis. The hymn is sung in this manner thrice, responding to the first three of twelve reproaches. In the Latin Church, the Trisagion is employed in the hour of Prime, in the ferial Preces, on ferias of Advent and Lent and on common Vigils. There is a Chaplet to the Holy Trinity used by the Order of the Most Holy Trinity called 'The Trisagion' or the 'Angelic Trisagion', which makes use of both forms of the Trisagion. It also occurs in the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin and in the Chaplet of Divine Mercy. In the Roman Catholic church, an indulgence of 100 days was once associated with the Trisagion when prayed once a day together with the Sanctus, with a contrite heart to adore the Holy Trinity.Joseph P. Christopher et al., 2003 The Raccolta St Athanasius Press page 1 = Anglican Communion = Book of Common Prayer  The Episcopal Church's 1979 Book of Common Prayer introduced the Trisagion into the Eucharist in both Rite One and Rite Two as part of the Word of God. In Rite One it follows the Summary of the Law. In Rite Two it can be used as an alternative to the Kyrie eleison, which follows the Collect for Purity and precedes the Collect of the Day. The form of the Trisagion found in the 1979 BCP is as follows: Holy God, Holy and Mighty, Holy Immortal One, Have mercy upon us.  Common Worship  In Common Worship used by the Church of England, the Trisagion is used principally as a concluding prayer of the Litany in the following form: > Holy God, holy and strong, holy and immortal, have mercy upon us. It is also used in the Good Friday liturgy in the same way as in the Roman Catholic Church.

Its western terminus is at U.S. Route 67 (very near, but not at the termini of Illinois Route 100 and Illinois Route 140) in Alton. Its eastern terminus at Illinois Route 127 at a rural intersection west of Tamalco. This is a distance of .  Route description  Illinois 143 overlaps Illinois Route 157 and Illinois Route 159 in Edwardsville, and Illinois Route 160 and U.S. Route 40 in Highland. It has 4 lanes from IL 140 to just east of Illinois Route 255 around Southern Illinois University, Edwardsville, and briefly around Interstate 55 east of Edwardsville. The rest of the road is generally rural and has 2 lanes.  History  SBI Route 143 ran from Benton to Harrisburg; this was replaced by Illinois Route 34 when it was extended north in 1937. That same year, IL 143 was applied to a former lettered route, Illinois Route 127A from Highland to Illinois 127. In 1950, it was extended west to Edwardsville. In 1964, it was extended west again to Alton, replacing Illinois Route 159. There have been no changes since. In 1987, the alignments of Illinois Route 3, Illinois Route 100, and Illinois Route 143 were switched to their current routes in the Alton area with the opening of the extension of the Homer M. Adams Parkway and the construction of Madison Avenue in Wood River. IL 143 was put on the new Madison Avenue alignment and routed on the Berm Highway, while IL 3 was put back on an older alignment through East Alton and the Homer Adams Parkway (later taking over the old IL 100 alignment north of Godfrey to Grafton), and IL 100 was put on then-unmarked River Road from Alton to Grafton. The old alignment of IL 143 (Alton-Edwardsville Road) became unmarked.

Aphid Baizongia pistaciae galls on the leaflets. The terebinth (Pistacia terebinthus), also called the turpentine tree, is a deciduous tree species of the genus Pistacia, native to the Mediterranean region from the western regions of Morocco, Spain and Portugal to Greece and western and southeastern Turkey, as well Iran. At one time terebinths growing on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea (in Syria and Lebanon) were regarded as a separate species, Pistacia palaestina, but these are now considered to be a synonym of P. terebinthus. Description The terebinth is a deciduous flowering plant belonging to the cashew family, Anacardiaceae; a small tree or large shrub, it grows to tall. The leaves are compound, long, odd pinnate with five to eleven opposite glossy oval leaflets, the leaflets long and broad. The flowers are reddish-purple, appearing with the new leaves in early spring. The fruit consists of small, globular drupes long, red to black when ripe. All parts of the plant have a strong resinous smell. The terebinth a dioecious tree, i.e. it exists as male and female specimens. For a viable population both sexes must be present. The oblong leaf is bright green, leathery, with long or more with three to nine leaflets. Leaves alternate, leathery and compound paripinnate (no terminal leaflet) with three or six deep green leaflets. They are generally larger and rounder than the leaves of the mastic, reminiscent of the leaves of carob tree. The flowers range from purple to green, the fruit is the size of a pea and turns from red to brown, depending on the degree of maturation. The whole plant emits a strong smell: bitter, resinous, or medicinal. In the vegetative period they develop \\"galls\\" shaped like a goat's horn (from which the plant gets the name \\"cornicabra\\", the common name in Spanish), that occur on the leaves and leaflets which have been bitten by insects. The species propagates by seeds and shoots. Although marred by the presence of galls, it is a very strong and resistant tree which survives in degraded areas where other species have been eliminated. Pistacia terebinthus is related to Pistacia lentiscus, with which it hybridizes frequently in contact zones. Pistacia terebinthus is more abundant in the mountains and inland and the mastic is usually found more frequently in areas where the Mediterranean influence of the sea moderates the climate. The mastic tree does not reach the size of the Pistacia terebinthus, but the hybrids are very difficult to distinguish. The mastic has winged stalks to its leaflets, i.e., they are flattened and side fins, whereas these stems in Pistacia terebinthus are simple. On the west coast of the Mediterranean, Canary Islands and Middle East, P. terebinthus can be confused with P. atlantica. Habitat Pistacia terebinthus in Pe√±as Blancas, Cartagena (Spain) Pistacia terebinthus in Yenifo√ßa, Turkey The terebinth prefers relatively moist areas, up to in elevation. Supports Mediterranean summer drought and frost more intense than mastic. The plant is common in the garrigue and maquis. It appears in deciduous oak wood. It has a gray trunk very aromatic, may have multiple trunks or stems when grown as a shrub. Usually reaching in height, although in rare cases can reach . P. terebinthus is one of the European species of Anacardiaceae, a family of about 600 mostly tropical species. It can be found to above sea level. P. terebinthus is more moisture demanding than the mastic and more resistant to cold. It requires a sunny exposure and average soils, tolerating lime and some salt, often grows near the sea, deep ravines and near salt-lakes and streams. History Historian of Mycenae John Chadwick believes that the terebinth is the plant called ki-ta-no in some of the Linear B tablets. He cites the work of a Spanish scholar, J.L. Melena, who had found \\"an ancient lexicon which showed that kritanos was another name for the turpentine tree, and that the Mycenaean spelling could represent a variant form of this word.\\"John Chadwick, The Mycenaean World (Cambridge: University Press, 1976), p. 120; Jose Melena, Durius v. 2 \\"ki-ta-no en las tabillas de Cnoso\\" (1974), p. 45-55 The Latin name is underlain by the Ancient Greek name œÑŒµœÅŒ≠Œ≤ŒπŒΩŒ∏ŒøœÇ, which, in turn, is underlain by a pre-Greek Pelasgian word, marked by the characteristic consonant complex ŒΩŒ∏. Terebinth from Oricum is referred to in Virgil's Aeneid, Book 10, line 136, where Ascanius in battle is compared to \\"ivory skilfully inlaid in [...] Orician terebinth\\" (\\"inclusum[...] Oricia terebintho [...] ebur\\"). Terebinth is referred to by Robin Lane Fox in Alexander the Great: \\"When a Persian king took the throne, he attended Pasargadae, site of King Cyrus's tomb, and dressed in a rough leather uniform to eat a ritual meal of figs, sour milk and leaves of terebinth.\\"Robin Lane Fox, Alexander the Great (Penguin Books, 2004), p. 273 The terebinth is mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures (or Old Testament), where the Hebrew word (plural ) is used, although the word is sometimes translated as 'oak'. (The Hebrew word means 'oak', and the words may be related.) The word terebinth is found in three successive chapters of Genesis (12:6, 13:18, 14:13, 18:1) in reference to the places where Abram (later Abraham) camped called \\"Terebinths of Mam're the Amorite\\".Robert Alter, (tr.) Genesis, W.W.Norton & Co. New York, London 1996 p.60 Here, the traditional rendering in English is \\"oaks of Mamre.\\" It is also found in Genesis chapter 35, where Jacob commands his family to remove idols that were taken as booty from the battle in Shechem before travelling to Bethel. Terebinths are also found in Isaiah in possible reference to idolatry associated with the trees, although in the Septuagint and Vulgate the word is translated 'idols', as the plural of .) The best known clear reference to a terebinth () in the Hebrew Scriptures is that of the Valley of Elah or 'Valley of the Terebinth' (), where David fought Goliath (, ). At least a few references occur in Judges: chapter 4 (in reference to Heber, the Kenite, of the children of Hobab), chapter 6 (in reference to an angel of the Lord who came to visit Gideon‚Äîmost versions use 'oak'), and Ch 9 (in reference to the crowning of Abimelech, by the terebinth of the pillar that was in Shechem‚Äîagain most versions use 'oak'). This reference of Abimelech's crowning by an oak is actually referring to the Palestine oak, closely related to the Kermes oak (Quercus coccifera). The Hebrew distinguishes the Palestine oak and the terebinth. It is also mentioned in Hosea 4:13 when Hosea is talking about Israel's spiritual adultery by sacrificing to false gods and how to repent and be forgiven in Hosea 14. Uses Terebinths are used as a source for turpentine, possibly the earliest known source. The word turpentine itself derives (via Old French and Latin) from the Greek word œÑŒµœÅŒµŒ≤ŒπŒΩŒ∏ŒØŒΩŒ∑ (terebinth√≠nƒì), the feminine form (to go with the feminine Greek word for resin) of an adjective œÑŒµœÅŒµŒ≤ŒØŒΩŒ∏ŒπŒΩŒøœÇ (tereb√≠nthinos), derived from the Greek noun œÑŒµœÅŒ≠Œ≤ŒπŒΩŒ∏ŒøœÇ (ter√©binthos), the name for the terebinth tree. The turpentine of the terebinth is now called Chian, Scio, or Cyprian turpentine. The fruits are used in Cyprus for baking of a specialty village bread. In Crete, where the plant is called tsikoudia, it is used to flavor the local variety of pomace brandy, also called tsikoudia. In the Northern Sporades the shoots are used as a vegetable (called tsits√≠ravla). The plant is rich in tannins and resinous substances and was used for its aromatic and medicinal properties in classical Greece. A mild sweet scented gum can be produced from the bark, and galls often found on the plant are used for tanning leather. A triterpene has been extracted from these galls. In Turkey, it is known as menengi√ß or bƒ±ttƒ±m. A coffee-like beverage, Kurdish coffee or menengi√ß kahvesi, is made from the roasted fruit, and a soap is made from the oil. Terebinth resin was used as a wine preservative in the entire ancient Near East, as proven by many findings in areas such as the foot of the Zagros Mountains and Middle Bronze Age Galilee.

It is a gated residential community of 175 homes, west of New York City. Glenmont History Llewellyn Park was founded in 1853 by Llewellyn Solomon Haskell, a New York City businessman and was designed by Alexander Jackson Davis. Haskell discovered the lush, wooded area on the eastern slope on the first range of the Watchung Mountains which was originally farmland owned by Ira Harrison Condit. Condits and their Cousins Family Website Purchasing 100 acres from Condit in 1855, Haskell set out to create a suburban community of country estates. These finely crafted homes would stand amid majestic trees and running streams. The first annual meeting of proprietors was held at the Park's Gatehouse on January 1, 1858 and continues today. Llewellyn Park was one of the first planned suburbs in the United States, where natural beauty was both carefully cultivated and allowed to remain undisturbed. The landscaping is in the 19th century romantic style of New York's Central Park, and includes winding paths, ornamental trees, shrubs, and flowers.Llewellyn Park New York Times, 1865 April 23 The Park became home to many residents of note, especially Thomas Edison, whose home Glenmont is part of the Thomas Edison National Historical Park. Other residents over the years included abolitionist James Miller McKim, whose charming house contained secret chambers to hide escaped slaves traversing the Underground Railroad, the Merck family (George W. Merck was raised there), and the Colgate family. Its annual meeting, going on for 158 years, is the longest continuous string of meetings of any residential association in the United States. A number of Llewellyn Park's homes were designed by prominent American architects including Alexander Jackson Davis, Calvert Vaux, Charles McKim, Stanford White, and Robert A.M. Stern. Main Street gatehouse The main entrance to Llewellyn Park is located on Main Street in West Orange, near Thomas Edison's factory complex, now a museum and also a part of the Thomas Edison National Historical Park. The entrance is within West Orange's historic district, which is entering a phase of major revitalization. There is a side entrance to Llewellyn Park located on Eagle Rock Avenue that is electronically monitored and activated by the security guards within the Gatehouse on the Main Street entrance. Llewellyn Park residents enjoy the combination of close proximity to New York City, a relaxed semi-rural lifestyle, and exceptional privacy. Community The Ramble is a common area of landscaped with streams and paths. Period gas lamps line the curving streets of the community. The Llewellyn Park Ladies Association is largely responsible for the beautification of the Park. Its activities include annual plantings; purchasing, and selecting appropriate sites for rustic architecture including gazebos and benches; and directing the Park's maintenance staff to care for the trees, shrubs and flowers. A major function of the Ladies Association is its commitment to fostering a sense of community among Park residents by planning social activities for adults and children. These activities include a Halloween Party for the children and a Holiday Party for adults. Recently the Ladies Association has also sponsored a barn dance, an Easter egg hunt, a Victorian picnic, and a High Tea. Residents' professions and occupations range widely and include business persons, professionals, academics, and artists. Residents operate a Llewellyn Park Historical Society dedicated to preserving historic artifacts relating to the creation and history of the Park. The Llewellyn Park Preservation Foundation (an independent 501 c(3) charitable organization) is dedicated to maintaining and restoring the historic character of Llewellyn Park.

Historically, Living Newspapers have also urged social action (both implicitly and explicitly) and reacted against naturalistic and realistic theatrical conventions in favor of the more direct, experimental techniques of agitprop theatre, including the extensive use of multimedia. Though Living Newspapers originated in Russia during the Bolshevik Revolution,Cosgrove \\"Living\\" iv the English term is most often associated with the Living Newspapers produced by the Federal Theatre Project. Part of the federally funded arts program established under the Works Progress Administration in the United States of the 1930s, the Federal Theatre Project wrote and presented a number of Living Newspapers on social issues of the day, including Triple-A Plowed Under, Injunction Granted, One-Third of a Nation, Power, and Spirochete. Controversy over the political ideology of the Living Newspapers contributed to the disbanding of the Federal Theatre Project in 1939,Cosgrove \\"Introduction\\" xx-xxi and a number of Living Newspapers already written or in development were never performed,Cosgrove \\"Living\\" 138 including several that addressed race issues.Nadler 615-622 History of the FTP's Living Newspapers=Establishment of the NY Living Newspaper Unit and Ethiopia= The Living Newspaper program began very shortly after the establishment of the Federal Theatre Project (FTP). Following her appointment as National Director of the FTP in July 1935, Hallie Flanagan, a professor and playwright at Vassar College,Witham 78 and playwright Elmer Rice set to work planning the organization and focus of the FTP.Cosgrove \\"Living\\" 42-43 The New York Living Newspaper Unit came from this meeting; allied with the American Newspaper Guild,Cosgrove \\"Introduction\\" x this first and most active of the Living Newspaper Units employed out-of-work journalists and theatre professionals of all types, providing hourly wages for many reporters and entertainers left unemployed by the Depression.Whitam 2 The research staff of the Living Newspaper Unit quickly compiled their first Living Newspaper, Ethiopia, which went into rehearsal in 1936.Cosgrove \\"Living\\" 48 It never opened to the public. The federal government issued a censorship order prohibiting the impersonation of heads of state onstage;Witham 3 the order effectively scuttled the production, which dramatized the invasion of Ethiopia by Italy and featured Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and other real-life figures prominently as characters. Elmer Rice withdrew from the FTP in protest.Cosgrove \\"Living\\" 48-49 =Controversy: Triple-A Plowed Under and Injunction Granted= Left with no script and the pressing need to provide its performers with a play, the Unit drew up another Living Newspaper, Triple-A Plowed Under, within a matter of weeks. Morale had dropped after the cancellation of Ethiopia, and the original director of Triple-A Plowed Under left in frustration; Joseph Losey, known for his support of the Communist Party and recently returned from a visit to Moscow, replaced him.Cosgrove \\"Living\\" 57-58 Triple-A Plowed Under dramatized the plight of Dust Bowl farmers and suggested that farmers and workers unite to cut out the \\"middlemen\\" ‚Äì dealers and other commercial interests.Cosgrove \\"Living\\" 60 The \\"Triple-A\\" in the title came from the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, which the play criticized.Cosgrove \\"Living\\" 59 Like other Living Newspapers to follow, it employed the \\"Voice of the Living Newspaper,\\" a disembodied voice which commented on and narrated the action; shadows; image projections; elaborate sound design, with sound effects and music; abrupt blackouts and scene changes; and other non-realistic devices to keep the audiences' attention and support the message of the play. A minor Living Newspaper, Events of 1935, followed Triple-A Plowed Under. A collage of scenes from many 1935 news events, ranging from celebrity gossip to major legal cases, 1935 ran for only 34 performances. Cosgrove identifies it as the \\"least successful\\" of all the Living Newspapers.Cosgrove \\"Introduction\\" xi Though Triple-A had clearly criticized government decisions and supported the laborer over the \\"merchant,\\" the Unit's third Living Newspaper, also directed by Losey, explicitly supported workers' organizations and angered members of the federal government. Injunction Granted, which opened four months after the close of Triple-A,Cosgrove \\"Living\\" 76 lampooned big business men such as H. J. Heinz and newspaper baron William Randolph HearstCosgrove \\"Living\\" 92 and called for unions to join the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), a major, militant workers' association. It aroused government concern during rehearsal; and Hallie Flanagan urged Losey to re-write parts of the script, but the play made it to the stage largely unaltered.Cosgrove \\"Introduction\\" xii The piece ran on over-the-top satire and explicit bias: Heinz was introduced holding a giant pickle; Dean Jennings of the Newspaper Guild trounced Hearst in a boxing match; and a clown (played by actor Norman LloydCosgrove \\"Introduction\\" xiii) served as master-of-ceremonies for the entire production, according to Cosgrove. Injunction Granted drew massive criticism and closed early. Losey soon left the Unit and the FTP, though Flanagan offered to give him another chance.Cosgrove \\"Introduction\\" xiv =The turnaround: Power and One-Third of a Nation= The Consumer (Norman Lloyd) discovers there is only one electric company that he can deal with. Allan Tower plays the Electric Company Manager in the New York production of Power (February‚ÄìAugust 1937). With the censorship of Ethiopia and the negative reaction to Injunction Granted, the Living Newspaper Unit had twice attracted criticism from the government that funded it. In order to continue as a federal program, it became more retrospect and less politically radical in its choice of topics but did not give up its dedication to reportage on major social issues and calls for social change. Its first production following Injunction Granted demonstrated this new emphasis. Opening early in 1937, Power clearly supported the policies of the New Deal and the Works Progress Administration. Power chronicled the search of the public consumer for affordable electric power and held up the Tennessee Valley Authority project as an example of where such power could come from.Whitham 79 The play also introduced the \\"little man\\" figure to the Living Newspaper ‚Äì a character who represented the consumer and the public, appearing throughout the play, asking questions and receiving explanations.Cosgrove \\"Living\\" 107-109 Power garnered a positive reception, running for 140 performances and then converting to a scaled-down travelling form for outdoors summer performances throughout the city.Cosgrove \\"Living\\" 108-109 The next Living Newspaper also met with public and critical success. Over the summer of 1937, Flanagan oversaw the Federal Theatre Project Summer School at Vassar College; the forty theatre artists invited to this program developed the first version of a Living Newspaper on tenant housing which grew to become One-Third of a Nation.Cosgrove \\"Introduction\\" xv-xvii In its finished form, One-Third of a Nation opened early in 1938 and ran for 237 performances, making it the most successful of the Living Newspapers. The play abandoned some of the experimental nature of the earlier Living Newspapers, using a very realistic set to display the filth and dangers of a tenant slum, but retained the episodic format and multimedia (sound, film, and image) displays that characterized the form. The production received praise from critics and may have helped push through housing legislation. It eventually opened in major cities throughout the country.Cosgrove \\"Introduction\\" xvi =The end of the FTP and the Living Newspaper Unit= Despite its rising success and less radical tone, the tide of government opinion turned against the Federal Theatre Project ‚Äì and the Living Newspapers in particular ‚Äì in 1938. Established in this year, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) began an investigation of the FTP, focusing on its alleged Communist sympathies and anti-American propagandism.Cosgrove \\"Introduction\\" xix-xx Flanagan defended the FTP and the Living Newspapers, holding that the program had presented propaganda, yes, but \\"... propaganda for democracy, propaganda for better housing,\\" not propaganda against the government.Cosgrove \\"Introduction\\" xx Despite her defense of the program and President Roosevelt's protests, Congress disbanded the FTP ‚Äì and with it, the New York Living Newspaper Unit ‚Äì on July 30, 1939.Cosgrove \\"Introduction xxi The end of the FTP and the Unit left many complete and partially developed Living Newspaper scripts unperformed and unfinished. Among these were three by African-American playwrights that dealt with race issues and racism, including Liberty Deferred, by Abram Hill and John Silvera, which followed the history of slavery in the U.S. and addressed the lynchings of African-Americans in the South.Hill 249-303 Some historians suggest that Congress shut down the Federal Theatre Project partially to stifle the voices of African-American theatre professionals and criticism of racism in the U.S., or that the FTP delayed production of these plays out of fear of just such a reprisal.Nadler 621 While it is no longer a federally funded initiative, the Living Newspaper project has influenced progressive theatre in the 21st Century. A good example of a theatre company performing in the style of the Living Newspaper is the progressive DC Theatre Collective whose piece, The Tea Party Project, was performed in Washington DC in July 2010. =Living Newspapers outside of New York= Poster for the original Chicago production of Spirochete (1938) Though the New York Living Newspaper Unit produced most of the major Living Newspapers, other units in cities throughout the U.S. produced or planned Living Newspapers. In most cases, these productions were local runs of the New York Living Newspapers. Both Power and One-Third of a Nation ran throughout the U.S., with the scripts altered to various degrees to suit local conditions. In Seattle, the mayor declared \\"Power Week\\" in honor of the week- long run of Power, recognizing the timeliness of the play's subject matter: With the public Bonneville hydroelectric project on the horizon, private and public power companies were vying for support in the city.Whitham 81 Non-New- York Units also researched and wrote their own Living Newspapers. The Southwest Unit, in California, planned and researched Spanish Grant, on a historical incident in which a series of \\"speculative land deals\\" took land from communities, and Land Grant, on the 1848 cession of California to the United States and corrupt land deals that led up to it.Cosgrove \\"Living\\" 115-116 Washington's unit planned Timber; Iowa's Dirt;O'Connor 92 and Connecticut's Stars and Bars; however, none of these regional Living Newspapers ever made it to full production.Cosgrove \\"Living\\" 139 On the other hand, Chicago produced an original Living Newspaper that rivalled the later New York Living Newspapers in its impact and positive reception. In 1938, Arnold Sundgaard's Spirochete, a Living Newspaper on the history of syphilis, opened in Chicago. Using the image projections, extensive sound design, shadowplay, brief scenes, and \\"little man\\" character (here, a patient embodying all syphilis sufferers throughout historyO'Connor 93) made standard by the New York Unit, Spirochete followed syphilis from its introduction in Europe in the 15th century through to the social stigma surrounding it in the 1930s. The play pushed for audiences to support the Marriage Test Law of 1937, which required blood tests for syphilis prior to marriage. Spirochete became the second most produced Living Newspaper, after One-Third of a Nation and ran in four other major cities as part of a nationwide syphilis-education and -prevention campaign.O'Connor 93-94, 96 Style of the FTP's Living Newspapers Though definitions of the Living Newspaper and its purpose, both within the Federal Theatre Project and at large, varied, certain characteristics united all of the FTP's Living Newspaper productions. First, a Living Newspaper's content always centered on some current event or issue affecting the United States working class at large ‚Äì whether it be the spread of syphilis, slum housing conditions, or the search for affordable electrical power. Teams of research workers, many of whom were out-of-work journalists, carried out extensive research to provide the factual base for each Living Newspaper. Editors then organized the information and turned it over to writers, who collectively assembled a Living Newspaper from this collage of facts, statistics, newspaper clippings, and anecdotes.Cosgrove \\"Living\\" 165-169 Though Hallie Flanagan repeatedly stated that Living Newspapers should be objective and unbiased, most Living Newspaper productions communicated a clear bias and a call for action from the watching audience. Second, the FTP's Living Newspapers tended to break from realistic stage conventions in favor of non-naturalistic, experimental dramaturgy and stage design. \\"Techniques Available to the Living Newspaper Dramatist,\\" a guide compiled by the Federal Theatre Project in 1938, lists many of the elements that became characteristic of the Living Newspaper. These included quick scene and set changes; flexibility of stage space, using many levels, rolling and hand-carried scenery, and scrims to establish a multitude of locations without elaborate constructed sets; projection of settings, statistics, and film; shadowplay; sound effects and full musical scores; the use of a loudspeaker to narrate and comment on the action; and abrupt blackouts and harsh spotlights. The guide also suggests the use of puppetry, modern dance, and pantomime. In terms of dramatic construction, the guide urges writers and designers to keep the concept of counterpoint in mind when constructing Living Newspapers‚Äîalternating quickly between scenes and voices displaying contrasting viewpoints, to comment on the action and keep the audience involved and aware.Cosgrove \\"Living\\" 238-244 Origins of the FTP's Living Newspapers The developers of the Living Newspapers built upon theatrical forms they had encountered in Bolshevik Russia, Germany, and European workers' theatre. Living-Newspaper-like performances appeared in Bolshevik Russia as early as 1919, using a variety of devices (such as lantern slides, songs, newspaper readings, and film segments) to present news and propaganda to the illiterate.Cosgrove, \\"Living\\" 7 As the form matured in Russia, workers' groups put on highly regionalized Living Newspapers, treating issues of public interest and concern.Cosgrove, \\"Living\\" 9 Zhivaya Gazeta (the Russian term for \\"Living Newspaper\\") reached its peak from 1923 to 1928;Cosgrove, \\"Living\\" 9-10 Hallie Flanagan visited the country and witnessed workers' performances during this period, in 1926.Cosgrove \\"Living\\" 8 The Blue Blouse theatre groups, which employed satire and demanding acrobatics to bring news to the public, particularly captured Flanagan's attention.Cosgrove, \\"Living\\" 12-13 The work of Russian theatre artists Vsevolod Meyerhold and Vladimir Mayakovsky, active during this time, also influenced the form,Cosgrove \\"Living\\" 7-8 as did the work of German theatre artists Bertolt Brecht and Erwin Piscator.Cosgrove \\"Living\\" vi See also * Theatre of the Oppressed NotesReferences * Cosgrove, Stuart.

The channels have since become available in Saudi Arabia via an unofficial satellite service known as beoutQ, which repackages beIN Sports channels as their own by overlaying its own digital on-screen graphics on the feed. beIN has published evidence linking the service Arabsat, but its operators have consistently denied any involvement. The beoutQ service has been criticised by a number of sports sanctioning bodies and event organisers due to its commercial-scale copyright infringement. On 2 October 2018, Qatar filed a case against Saudi Arabia with the World Trade Organization, citing violations of the TRIPS Agreement. The same day, beIN Media Group also initiated an investment arbitration lawsuit against Saudi Arabia seeking US$1 billion in damages, citing beoutQ and other measures decided to hinder its business in Saudi Arabia. In February 2019, beIN's managing director stated that rightsholder stances on beoutQ's \\"industrial-scale theft\\" would be a consideration in future rights deals, and that it would also pay less because it can no longer guarantee that its rights would be protected. He went on to explain that \\"we have been warning of the very real commercial consequences of beoutQ's theft of world sport and entertainment for almost two years now ‚Äì yet the piracy continues with impunity every day and represents an existential threat to the economic model of the sports and entertainment industry.\\" In June 2019, beIN laid off 300 employees, citing the piracy issues as a factor. It also declined to renew its rights to Formula One, which were instead acquired by free-to-air satellite channel MBC Action. = Monopoly accusations = Free-to-air broadcasters in Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia decided against sub-licensing domestic rights to the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations from beIN, considering the fees they were charging to be too exorbitant. On 22 June 2018, minister Saud al-Qahtani stated that the Saudi Arabian Football Federation (SAFF) had filed a complaint with FIFA against beIN Sports' monopolization of sports broadcast rights in the MENA region. On 21 August 2018, beIN Sports was fined US$2.6 million by Saudi Arabia for violations of competition law, including forced bundling of its services with other unrelated channels. beIN responded to the fine by claiming it was politically-motivated, arguing that they were being \\"attacked by the Saudi authorities for doing exactly what sports and entertainment broadcasters around the world do, and indeed what other broadcasters active in the Saudi market also do\\", and that the actions were \\"another illegitimate attempt by Saudi Arabia to drive beIN's highly successful business from the country, putting politics ahead of the interests of Saudi consumers.\\", also factoring in the aforementioned beoutQ piracy operation. On 23 August 2018, beIN Sports' license to broadcast in Saudi Arabia was officially revoked. On 12 March 2019, the SAFF announced that the Asian Football Confederation had stripped beIN Sports of its media rights in Saudi Arabia to \\"cancel\\" its monopoly on football, citing the \\"illegality of BeIN Sport to transmit in the Kingdom due to the grave violations of the laws and regulations BeIN Sport has committed\\", and \\"its inability to obtain the required licenses necessary for it to fulfil its commitments in transmitting AFC's competitions to the viewers and followers in the Kingdom\\". The AFC announced that it would \\"gradually\\" transition its media rights to an in-house digital platform, beginning with a Saudi Professional League match occurring that week. The AFC had previously condemned the aforementioned beoutQ for its illegal broadcasts of the 2019 AFC Asian Cup. beIN subsequently announced that it would pursue legal action, accusing the AFC of apparent collusion with the SAFF to breach its media rights agreements.  Broadcast = Satellite = The only European satellite broadcasting JSC Sports is Hot Bird. According to Al Jazeera's former general manager, Aiman Jada, this decision was imposed because the channel is being picked up in the south of Europe, which is causing rights problems. On 1 March 2014, they launched SD switch-off on satellite. These channels will carry a text caption with SD shutdown information until 11 June 2014.

The Belvedere palaces were the summer residence of Prince Eugene of Savoy (1663‚Äì1736). The ensemble was built in the early eighteenth century by the famous Baroque architect, Johann Lucas von Hildebrandt, and comprises the Upper and Lower Belvedere, with the Orangery and Palace Stables, as well as extensive gardens. As one of Europe's most stunning Baroque landmarks, it is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Today, the Belvedere houses the greatest collection of Austrian art dating from the Middle Ages to the present day, complemented by the works of international artists. At the Upper Belvedere, visitors not only encounter artworks drawn from over five hundred years of art history but can also experience the magnificent staterooms. In addition to the Lower and Upper Belvedere, the museum has further sites at Prince Eugene's town palace and the 21er Haus as well as the Gustinus Ambrosi Museum. The Belvedere's art collection presents an almost complete overview of the development of art in Austria and, thus, an insight into the country's history. The world's largest collection of Gustav Klimt's paintings lies at the heart of the presentation of Art around 1900, on show at the Upper Belvedere. Its highlights are Klimt's paintings, The Kiss (1908/09) and Judith and the Head of Holofernes (1901), and masterpieces by Egon Schiele and Oskar Kokoschka. Key works of French Impressionism and the greatest collection of Viennese Biedermeier art are further attractions at the museum.  History  The two Belvedere palaces housed an array of artworks even when they were the summer residence of the art patron and collector, Prince Eugene. After the Prince‚Äôs death, the Habsburgs acquired some of his collections together with the palaces. Various parts of the imperial art collection were subsequently placed on display at the Belvedere from 1781 onwards. In 1903, the state's \\"Moderne Galerie\\" was opened at the Lower Belvedere. After the fall of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy, the Upper Belvedere and the Orangery were converted into museums as well. The √ñsterreichische Galerie (Austrian Gallery), as the museum was named in 1921, came to comprise the Baroque Museum in the Lower Belvedere (opened in 1923), the Gallery of 19th Century Art at the Upper Belvedere (from 1924), and the Modern Gallery at the Orangery (from 1929). The Belvedere's collection of medieval art was first exhibited at the Orangery next to the Lower Belvedere in 1953. In 1955, after years of rebuilding and renovation, the Upper Belvedere was reopened to the public, showing works by Gustav Klimt, Egon Schiele, Oskar Kokoschka, and other major Austrian artists. In the years after the Second World War, there were many acquisitions and the museum was expanded and modernized. The √ñsterreichische Galerie Belvedere is today one of the Austrian Federal Museums (Bundesmuseen) and since 2000 has been a vollrechtsf√§hige \\"wissenschaftliche Anstalt\\" (a legally independent public research/scientific institution). View over the park of the Belvedere Agnes Husslein, formerly director of the Salzburg Rupertinum and the Museum der Moderne on the M√∂nchsberg, was director of the Belvedere between 2007 and 2016. She has positioned the Belvedere as a museum of Austrian art in an international context. Following extensive adaptation and remodelling, the highlights of the collections of medieval and Baroque art (previously in the Lower Belvedere) have been placed on display at the Upper Belvedere since spring 2008. For the first time, the entire scope of the permanent collection, from the Middle Ages to the mid-twentieth century, can now be seen under one roof. The adapted rooms in the Lower Belvedere and Orangery now provide space for temporary exhibitions. Moreover, a study collection of the medieval holdings was set up in the former Palace Stables. The permanent collections were redisplayed in 2011. Visitor numbers have been increasing steadily during the years of Husslein's directorship and, in 2012, they surpassed the one million mark for the first time (1,088,000 visitors).

He was probably born between 1575 and 1582 in Norfolk, one of four children sired by a John Dover, but as the parish registers in Great Ellingham did not begin until 1630 it is impossible to be certain. Dover was a scholar at the University of Cambridge in 1595, possibly as a sizar at Queens' College: (one of three entries under the name \\"Robert Dover\\") during his time at Cambridge the \\"Gog Magog Games\\" were held on the Gog Magog Hills outside Cambridge, although it is not known whether these were already being termed \\"Olympik\\" as was the case by 1620. Dover left university early to avoid swearing the Oath of Supremacy, and a Robert Dover was among those questioned by Lord Burghley's officers looking for recusants in Norfolk. On 27 February 1605 Dover was admitted to Gray's Inn, and was probably called to the bar in 1611. Dover was known as a wit, and author of a lost poem The Wandering Jew: according to Peter Heylin, a pageant put on at Gray's Inn. In 1611 he moved to Saintbury, near Chipping Campden. After the inauguration of the Games, he obtained patronage from neighbour Endymion Porter, a well-connected courtier, who arranged for Dover to receive a cast-off set of royal garments to wear while presiding. Later in life he moved to Barton-on-the-Heath. Dover founded his annual Games held in the Cotwsold hills above Chipping Campden in about 1612, and presided over them for forty years. A mixture of courtly and folk events, the Cotswold Olimpicks were so named in Annalia Dubrensia, one of a series of literary celebrations of the events. The games consisted of cudgel- playing, wrestling, running at the quintain, jumping, casting the bar and hammer, hand-ball, gymnastics, rural dances and games and horse-racing, the winners in which received valuable prizes. The Games were interrupted by the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642. Revived after the Restoration, the Games continued until 1852, and were again revived in 1965. In 1610 Dover married Sibilla Sanford, daughter of William Cole, Dean of Lincoln and widow of John Sanford of Stow on the Wold; they had two sons (Robert, died in infancy, and John, 1614‚Äì1696) and two daughters (Sibella and Abigail). Robert Dover was buried at Barton on 24 July 1652(the date of 6 June 1641 appears to be a mistake). There is a monument to Robert Dover at Dover's Hill, near Aston-sub-Edge.

It was nominated for the 1964 Hugo Award for Short Fiction.The LOCUS Index to SF Awards  Plot summary  The story is narrated by a gifted human linguist and poet named Gallinger, who is part of a mission studying Mars. He becomes the first human to learn the \\"high language\\" of the intelligent Martians, and to be allowed to read their sacred texts. He comes to believe that Martian culture is essentially fatalistic, following an event in the distant past that left the long-lived Martians sterile. The Martian high priestess regards Gallinger highly, and over the course of months, his theological and poetical discussion elevate him to a status something like a prophet. Ultimately, he is seduced by a Martian temple dancer and impregnates her, the first such pregnancy on the planet in hundreds of years. The Martians appear not to take this well, as it contradicts their religion's expectation of extinction. Gallinger sets out to do two things: he translates the Biblical book of Ecclesiastes, which he finds thematically similar to their religious texts, into the High Tongue. As part of the cultural exchange he engages in with the High Priestess, he promises to bring her a rose, since the Martians have never seen one. The ship's biologist grows a rose and gives it to Gallinger. In anger at Martian religious fatalism and impassioned by his love for the dancer and his child-to-be, Gallinger breaks into the temple during a closed service and reads to the Martians from his translation of Ecclesiastes. He mocks it as he reads it, stating: He discovers that the Martian religion is more complicated than he had originally realized, as is his role in fulfilling prophecy. It has been prophesied that a stranger will \\"go shod in the temple\\", breaking in without removing all unclean items, restoring life to the Martian race and bringing something new. His actions have brought life, and the High Priestess takes the rose vowing to learn how to grow the flower. The story ends well for the Martians, though perhaps less so for Gallinger, who discovers his dancer was only fulfilling her religious duty by seducing him, not caring for him otherwise. He attempts suicide, but, when he wakes up, he is in the infirmary, and he sees Mars through a port, growing farther away as the ship leaves Mars to return to Earth. Reception and reprinting \\"A Rose for Ecclesiastes\\" has been anthologized several times, including in Isaac Asimov Presents the Great SF Stories #25 (edited by Isaac Asimov and Martin H. Greenberg), The Doors of His Face, The Lamps of His Mouth, and Other Stories, and Science Fiction: The Science Fiction Research Association Anthology (edited by Patricia S.

For 20 years, she was the muse of French poet and art critic Charles Baudelaire. They met in 1842 when Duval left Haiti for France, and the two remained together, albeit stormily, for the next two decades. Duval is said to have been the woman whom Baudelaire loved most in his life after his mother. She was born in Haiti on an unknown date, sometime around 1820.

As a poet, he published more than a hundred poems. He was born in Jiayingzhou, now Mei County, Guangdong, and died 57 years later in the same place. His important contributions to China made him a recognised figure of his time, and a namesake foundation has been established in his honour. Huang's former residence is now marked as a public museum. Early life and career Huang was born May 29, 1848 in Jiayingzhou (now Mei County), Guangdong, China to a family of Hakka heritage. His father Huang Hung Chow was a scholar-official (Juren or ‰∏æ‰∫∫) and served the courts of the Qing dynasty. At age three, he witnessed the effects of the greatest land reforms in China. As a toddler, the younger Huang could recite the famous Chinese anthology Thousand Families Poems () and as a nine-year-old child studied poems from the Tang dynasty. His life took a turn a few years later, during the Taiping Rebellion, when he was robbed of many of his possessions. He applied to be a Juren, like his father, when he became of age in 1877. Despite heavy competition, he found success and was posted to Tokyo, Japan to serve as the Imperial Chinese Embassy's Counsellor. In September 1880, he published Korea Strategy a paper regarding the high level plans of Korea (unified as it then was). Huang suggested that China and Korea become good allies. The work is described by one source as \\"a work of destiny that determined the modern history of East Asia\\". While in Japan, he did some editorial work for the Japan World Magazine, looked into aspects of the medicine of the country, and noted how much the country had progressed through time and published his studies in a book, Treatises on Japan (printed 1890). The Guangxu Emperor was fascinated with the work and invited Huang to detailedly explain it to him in person. It was partially because of Huang's book that the Guangxu Emperor amended some rules in China. Huang is also considered to be a philosopher, having analysed, discussed, and questioned the framework of China. His influences in philosophy included the Enlightenment figures Rousseau and Montesquieu. Afterwards in 1882, Huang was assigned as Consul-General in San Francisco, United States. During his time there, he realised how wealthy the immigrant Chinese had become, and how much of an asset they were to China. Huang wrote a poem about Frederick Bee, an official at the Chinese Consulate. After seven years in the United States, he moved back to his home country China. In 1890, he relocated to London to act as the Counsellor of the Chinese Embassy; one year later he was reassigned to Singapore to become the Consul-General there. He witnessed how similar the Singaporean Chinese, both rich and generous, were to the native Chinese. Disagreeing with China's policy of not allowing overseas Chinese to return to the country, and torturing them if they did so, Huang composed a formal request to the Emperor to do away with the rule, offering the view that China was \\"driv[ing] fish into other people's nets\\". The request was accepted and on January 29, 1894, it was announced that the Chinese overseas were no longer barred from returning to China. In between, Huang was Hunan Province's Salt Intendant and he started the Journal for Contemporary Affairs. The change of policy was widely celebrated and reported; Huang was soon to be appointed China's ambassador to Japan. However, before that could materialize, the ruler of China changed from the Guangxu Emperor to the Xuantong Emperor (see Hundred Days' Reform). With the Guangxu Emperor detained, Huang's career as a diplomat ended. He slammed Empress Dowager Cixi's coup but at the same time expressed his relief at being freed of his diplomatic duties. Personal life Huang (pictured in direct middle of front row) with family members, circa 1900 Huang had thoughts regarding race. As a teenager he expressed that every person \\"is made from yellow clay\\". Decades later he asked, \\"Why is the yellow race not the only race in the world?\\" Huang enjoyed composing poetry. He was also patriotic towards China, and once described it as a gold-paved nation. He was well-liked as a poet and his poetical works received positive criticism, with one source citing him as \\"the most distinguished poet among the late nineteenth-century reformers\\". His influences in poetry included Wei Yuan, Gong Zizhen, and Jin He. His grandmother was Lady Li, whose death when Huang was still a child supposedly put him in \\"deep sorrow\\", as evidenced in a poem pertaining to Li's tomb. Most of Huang's poems relate to world affairs of his time, including foreign ones, such as the presidential elections in the United States. In total, he published more than a hundred poems. After he died, an anthology of his poems, Poems of the Human Environment (), was published and remains popular in China. A proponent of the late Qing Poetic Revolution, select poems of his include: The Mountain Song, The Cherry Blossom Festival, The Fog of London, Songs of the Taiping Rebels, On The Road to Wuqing, and Expelling the Visitor. In his lifetime, he also showed an interest in opening schools in various countries in Asia. Huang and Liang Qichao were close friends. Huang extensively toured many parts of Asia, his favourite being Malaysia. His nephew, Parkcane C. Hwang, was the founder and manager of the Bank of China in Singapore. Death and legacy Evading arrest following the change of ruler of China, Huang fled to his hometown of Jiayingzhou, where he died on March 28, 1905, aged 58. Huang is remembered for saying the famous and often-quoted line when he was twenty years old, \\"ÊàëÊâãÂÜôÊàëÂè£ÔºåÂè§Â≤ÇËÉΩÊãòÁâµ!\\", which roughly means that it is perfectly fine to express one's feelings whenever one feels like it. Huang is credited as the \\"first Chinese to use the word ÊñáÊòé to mean civilisation\\", a term which he made use of in one of his poetry works. His body is as of 2013 missing, having been thrown into a dumpster following looting of his tomb. The Huang Zun Xian Foundation, based in Hong Kong, has listed finding the body of Huang as one of its missions. One source credits Huang as \\"the first Chinese diplomat and scholar who championed for human rights for the early Chinese migrants\\", whilst another exalts him as \\"one of the most famous authors of late nineteenth-century China\\". An exhibition honoring the achievements of Huang was held in January 1991. It featured artistic depictions of him by some 130 various artists. Huang's former abode in Mei County has been converted into a museum and a local government-promoted tourist destination. It is cited as a \\"key preservation unit of cultural relic\\" and an exemplification of the \\"beauty of the Lingnan-style garden\\".

Although any person can exercise this power at any time during their life, its use is rare outside of a will. The power is divided into two broad categories: general powers of appointment and special powers of appointment. The holder of a power of appointment differs from the trustee of a trust in that the former has no obligation to manage the property for the generation of income, but need only distribute it. General power of appointment Example: \\"I leave my video game collection to be distributed as my son Andrew sees fit.\\" A general power of appointment is defined for federal estate tax purposes in the Internal Revenue Code ¬ß2041. A general power of appointment is one which allows the holder of the power to appoint to himself, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his or her estate the right to have the beneficial use and enjoyment of certain property covered by the power of appointment. The holder of a general power of appointment is treated for estate tax purposes as if he or she is the owner of the property subject to the power, whether or not the power is exercised. Thus, the property which is subject to the power is includable in the power holder's estate for estate tax purposes. A general power of appointment is a key element of a type of marital deduction tax law as prescribed in Internal Revenue Code ¬ß2056(b)(5). It is a trust that qualifies for the marital deduction, provided that the surviving spouse is given the income at least annually and the surviving spouse has a general power of appointment over the trust property remaining at his death. Most general powers of appointment are exercisable under a will. The holder of the power refers to the document creating the power in his or her will and designates who among the permissible objects of the power should receive the property. The power could be exercised by creating further trusts. If the power of appointment is not exercised, the default provision of the document that created the power takes over. Special power of appointment Example: \\"I leave my cactus collection to my children, my wife Pat to choose who receives which cactus.\\" A special power of appointment allows the recipient to distribute the designated property among a specified group or class of people, not including donee, donee's estate, creditors of donee, or creditors of donee's estate.See, e.g., New York Estates Powers and Trusts Law ¬ß 10-3.2. For example, a testator might grant his brother the special power to distribute property among the testator's three children. The brother would then have the authority to choose which of the testator's children gets which property. Unlike a general power of appointment, the refusal of the appointed party to exercise a specific power of appointment causes the designated property to revert as a gift to the members of a group or a class. A special power of appointment may be exclusive or nonexclusive. If exclusive, the donee can appoint all the property to one or more members of the class of permissible appointees to the exclusion of the other members of the class. If nonexclusive, the donee must appoint some property to each object.Dukeminier, J. et al. Wills, Trusts, and Estates, Eighth Edition. Aspen Publishers, New York: 2009, p. 822 Special powers of appointment also appear in the context of a trust and are primarily used to reduce liability for generation-skipping transfer tax, or to provide asset protection trust features without fraudulent conveyance liability. Such trusts are referred to as SPA Trusts. Testamentary power and power presently exercisable In addition to general and special powers, donors may limit when the power may be exercised by the donees. Testamentary powers are usually indicated by the inclusion of limiting language in the granting instrument such as \\"to B for life, remainder to persons as B shall 'by will' appoint\\". General powers presently exercisable do not contain such limitations on power. Wording such as \\"to B for life, and upon B's death to those that B shall appoint\\" indicates a power presently exercisable, not a testamentary power. In some jurisdictions, the donee's creditors cannot reach the appointive property when the donee has a presently exercisable power of appointment as long as the power is unexercised.See e.g., Irwin Union Bank & Trust Co. v.

Life  Schmitz was educated at a Realgymnasium in Hamburg, and grew up speaking both English and German. The family spent World War I in the United States, then returned to Germany. Schmitz traveled to Chicago in 1930 to go to business school, then switched to a correspondence course in journalism. Unable to find a job because of the Great Depression, he returned to Germany to work with his father's company. Schmitz lived in various German cities, where he worked for the International Harvester Company, until his family left shortly before World War II broke out in Europe. During World War II, Schmitz served as an aerial photographer in the Pacific for the United States Army Air Corps. After the war, he and his brother-in-law managed a business which manufactured trailers until they ended the business in 1949. After the war, he made his home in California, where he lived until his death. Schmitz died of congestive lung failure in 1981 after a five-week stay in hospital in Los Angeles. He was survived by his wife, Betty Mae Chapman Schmitz.  Writing  Schmitz wrote mostly short stories, which sold chiefly to Galaxy Science Fiction and Astounding Science-Fiction (which later became Analog Science Fiction and Fact). Gale Biography in Context called him \\"a craftsmanlike writer who was a steady contributor to science fiction magazines for over 20 years.\\" Schmitz is best known as a writer of \\"space opera\\", and for his strong female characters (such as Telzey Amberdon and Trigger Argee) who did not conform to the \\"damsel in distress\\" stereotype typical of science fiction of the time. His first published story was \\"Greenface\\", published in August 1943 in Unknown. Most of his works are part of the \\"Hub\\" series. However, the novel that \\"is usually thought of as Schmitz's best work\\" is The Witches of Karres, concerning juvenile \\"witches\\" with genuine psi-powers and their escape from slavery. The Witches of Karres was nominated for a Hugo Award. In recent years, his novels and short stories have been republished by Baen Books, edited and with notes by Eric Flint. In an introductory essay comparing Schmitz with contemporary author A. E. van Vogt, Dozois wrote, \\"Although he lacked van Vogt's paranoid tension and ornately Byzantine plots, the late James H. Schmitz was considerably better at people than van Vogt was, crafting even his villains as complicated, psychologically complex, and non-stereotypical characters, full of surprising quirks and behaviors that you didn't see in a lot of other Space Adventure stuff.\\" Dozois added: John Clute writes in The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, Greg Fowlkes, editor-in-chief of Resurrected Press, said, \\"During the 50s and 60s \\"Space Opera\\" and James H. Schmitz were almost synonymous. He was famous for his tales of interstellar secret agents and galactic criminals, and particularly for heroines such as Telzey Amberdon and Trigger Argee. Many of these characters had enhanced \\"psionic\\" powers that let them use their minds as well as their weapons to foil their enemies. All of them were resourceful in the best heroic tradition.\\" In an essay in the anthology The Good Old Stuff (1998), Dozois laments that the book Agent of Vega is \\"long out-of-print, alas, but one which ‚Äì if you can find it ‚Äì delivers as pure a jolt of Widescreen Space Opera Sense of wonder as can be found anywhere.\\" However, the website Free Speculative Fiction Online freely offers Agent of Vega, along with several of Schmitz's other stories, including \\"Greenface\\", \\"Balanced Ecology\\", \\"Lion Loose\\", \\"Goblin Night\\", and many more. Schmitz wrote the introduction to the concordance The Universes of E. E. Smith.  Legacy  Gardner Dozois has said, in prefacing the Schmitz tale \\"The Second Night of Summer\\", in which humans on the planet Noorhut face an attack from aliens and are, unbeknownst to themselves, saved by the actions of a single woman with psi powers, Granny Wannattel, with the sole help of a friendly alien she calls her pony: With his popular equality-between-the-sexes fiction, Schmitz eased the way for later writers such as Joanna Russ, James Tiptree, Jr., Kit Reed, Connie Willis, Sheri S. Tepper, and other science fiction authors who used female protagonists and feminine point-of-view more than half the time. Of \\"The Second Night of Summer\\", Dozois went on to write, \\"the hero of the piece is not only a woman, but an old woman ... a choice that most adventure writers wouldn't even make now, in 1998, let alone in 1950, which is when Schmitz made it!\\" Mercedes Lackey places her first meeting with science fiction at age 10 or 11, when she happened to pick up her father's copy of James H. Schmitz's Agent of Vega.

It was painted in 1882 and exhibited at the Paris Salon of that year. It depicts a scene in the Folies Berg√®re nightclub in Paris. The painting originally belonged to the composer Emmanuel Chabrier, a close friend of Manet, and hung over his piano. It is now in the Courtauld Gallery in London. Painting The painting exemplifies Manet's commitment to Realism in its detailed representation of a contemporary scene. Many features have puzzled critics but almost all of them have been shown to have a rationale, and the painting has been the subject of numerous popular and scholarly articles.Malcolm Park, Ambiguity, and the Engagement of Spatial Illusion within the Surface of Manet's Paintings (PhD diss., University of New South Wales, Australia, 2001).Thierry de Duve, \\"Intentionality and Art Historical Methodology: A Case Study\\". Nonsite.org Issue #6, July 1, 2012 ; builds and corrects previous work Thierry de Duve, How Manet's A Bar at the Folies-Bergere is Constructed, Critical Enquiry, Vol. 25, No. 1, Autumn 1998, pp. 136-168. The central figure stands before a mirror, although critics‚Äîaccusing Manet of ignorance of perspective and alleging various impossibilities in the painting‚Äîhave debated this point since the earliest reviews were published. In 2000, however, a photograph taken from a suitable point of view of a staged reconstruction was shown to reproduce the scene as painted by Manet.\\"Manet's Bar at the Folies-Berg√®re: One Scholar's Perspective\\" , www.getty.edu. Retrieved July 20, 2012. According to this reconstruction, \\"the conversation that many have assumed was transpiring between the barmaid and gentleman is revealed to be an optical trick‚Äîthe man stands outside the painter's field of vision, to the left, and looks away from the barmaid, rather than standing right in front of her.\\" As it appears, the observer should be standing to the right and closer to the bar than the man whose reflection appears at the right edge of the picture. This is an unusual departure from the central point of view usually assumed when viewing pictures drawn according to perspective. Asserting the presence of the mirror has been crucial for many modern interpreters.Bradford R. Collins, ed., 12 Views of Manet's Bar, Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1996 It provides a meaningful parallel with Las Meninas, a masterpiece by an artist Manet admired, Diego Vel√°zquez. There has been a considerable development of this topic since Michel Foucault broached it in his book The Order of Things (1966).Foucault has given a talk on Manet's Bar at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo on April 8, 1970. He had planned a book on Manet's painting and gave a series of lectures during 1970/1 but the project was abandoned; see Cahiers de L'Herne: Michel Foucault, mars 2011 The art historian Jeffrey Meyers describes the intentional play on perspective and the apparent violation of the operations of mirrors: \\"Behind her, and extending for the entire length of the four-and-a-quarter-foot painting, is the gold frame of an enormous mirror. The French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty has called a mirror 'the instrument of a universal magic that changes things into spectacles, spectacles into things, me into others, and others into me.' We, the viewers, stand opposite the barmaid on the other side of the counter and, looking at the reflection in the mirror, see exactly what she sees... A critic has noted that Manet's 'preliminary study shows her placed off to the right, whereas in the finished canvas she is very much the centre of attention.' Though Manet shifted her from the right to the center, he kept her reflection on the right. Seen in the mirror, she seems engaged with a customer; in full face, she's self-protectively withdrawn and remote.\\"Jeffrey Meyers, Impressionist Quartet: The Intimate Genius of Manet and Morisot, Degas and Cassatt. New York: Harcourt, 2005. p. 77 The painting is rich in details which provide clues to social class and milieu. The woman at the bar is a real person, known as Suzon, who worked at the Folies-Berg√®re in the early 1880s. For his painting, Manet posed her in his studio. By including a dish of oranges in the foreground, Manet identifies the barmaid as a prostitute, according to art historian Larry L. Ligo, who says that Manet habitually associated oranges with prostitution in his paintings. T.J. Clark says that the barmaid is \\"intended to represent one of the prostitutes for which the Folies-Berg√®re was well-known\\", who is represented \\"as both a salesperson and a commodity‚Äîsomething to be purchased along with a drink.\\"Doris Lanier, Absinthe, the Cocaine of the Nineteenth Century: A History of the Hallucinogenic Drug and Its Effect on Artists and Writers in Europe and the United States, McFarland, 2004, pp. 102‚Äì103. Other notable details include the pair of green feet in the upper left-hand corner, which belong to a trapeze artist who is performing above the restaurant's patrons. The beer bottles depicted are easily identified by the red triangle on the label as Bass Pale Ale, and the conspicuous presence of this English brand instead of German beer has been interpreted as documentation of anti-German sentiment in France in the decade after the Franco-Prussian War.Kenneth Bendiner, Food In Painting: From The Renaissance To The Present, Reaktion Books, 2004, pp. 73‚Äì74. Cultural references The 1934 ballet Bar aux Folies-Berg√®re with choreography by Ninette de Valois and music of Chabrier was created from, and based around, Manet's painting.Rambert, Marie. Quicksilver: an autobiography. Papermac (Macmillan Publishers Ltd), London, 1983, p157. The 1947 film The Private Affairs of Bel Ami faithfully references A Bar at the Folies-Berg√®re twenty nine minutes into the film with a look-alike actress, set and props as the main characters enter the establishment. The painting was the inspiration of a song (possibly by Sydney Carter) in the popular theatre production The Lyric Revue, in London in 1951. The refrain went \\"Oh, how I long to be Back in my dear Brittany ... But fate has chosen me For the bar at the Folies- Berg√®res\\". The painting The Bar (1954) by Australian artist John Brack, which depicts a comparatively grim and austere Melbourne bar-room scene, is an ironic reference to A Bar at the Folies-Berg√®re. In the 1988 Eddie Murphy film Coming To America, during the party scene at McDowell's house, there is a spoof on the painting above the couch, in which the central female figure is replaced with a dark-skinned woman instead. Canadian artist Jeff Wall makes reference to A Bar at the Folies-Berg√®re in his work Picture for Women (1979).Merritt, Naomi. \\"Manet's Mirror and Jeff Wall's Picture for Women: Reflection or Refraction?\\" Emaj (Electronic Melbourne Art Journal), Issue 4, 2009. Merritt discusses the role of the mirror in this work. The Tate Modern wall text for Picture of Women, from the 2005‚Äì2006 exhibition Jeff Wall Photographs 1978‚Äì2004, outlines the influence of Manet's painting: > In Manet's painting, a barmaid gazes out of frame, observed by a shadowy > male figure. The whole scene appears to be reflected in the mirror behind > the bar, creating a complex web of viewpoints. Wall borrows the internal > structure of the painting, and motifs such as the light bulbs that give it > spatial depth. The figures are similarly reflected in a mirror, and the > woman has the absorbed gaze and posture of Manet's barmaid, while the man is > the artist himself. Though issues of the male gaze, particularly the power > relationship between male artist and female model, and the viewer's role as > onlooker, are implicit in Manet's painting, Wall updates the theme by > positioning the camera at the centre of the work, so that it captures the > act of making the image (the scene reflected in the mirror) and, at the same > time, looks straight out at us.Gallery Guide text for the exhibition Jeff > Wall Photographs 1978‚Äì2004, Tate Modern, London, 21 October 2005 to 8 > January 2006 quoted in David Campany, \\"'A Theoretical Diagram in an Empty > Classroom': Jeff Wall's Picture for Women\\", Oxford Art Journal 20.1 (2007): > 12-14.

His nickname, Gato, is Spanish for \\"cat\\". Biography Born to a family of musicians, Barbieri began playing music after hearing Charlie Parker's \\"Now's the Time\\". He played the clarinet and later the alto saxophone while performing with the Argentinean pianist Lalo Schifrin in the late 1950s. By the early 1960s, while playing in Rome, he also worked with the trumpeter Don Cherry. By now influenced by John Coltrane's late recordings, as well as those from other free jazz saxophonists such as Albert Ayler and Pharoah Sanders, he began to develop the warm and gritty tone with which he is associated. In the late 1960s, he was fusing music from South America into his playing and contributed to multi-artist projects like Charlie Haden's Liberation Music Orchestra and Carla Bley's Escalator Over The Hill. His score for Bernardo Bertolucci's 1972 film Last Tango in Paris earned him a Grammy Award and led to a record deal with Impulse! Records. By the mid-1970s, he was recording for A&M; Records and moved his music towards soul-jazz and jazz-pop. Caliente! (1976) included his best known song, a rendition of Carlos Santana's \\"Europa\\". That and the follow-up album, Ruby Ruby (1977) were both produced by fellow musician and label co-founder, Herb Alpert. Although he continued to record and perform well into the 1980s, including composing the scores to films such as Firepower (1979) and Strangers Kiss (1983), the death of his wife Michelle led him to withdraw from the public arena. He returned to recording and performing in the late 1990s, composing original scores at the behest of friend Bahman Maghsoudlou for Amir Naderi's Manhattan by Numbers (1991) and Daryush Shokof's Seven Servants (1996). The album Qu√© Pasa (1997) moved more into the style of smooth jazz. Barbieri was the inspiration for the character Zoot in the fictional Muppet band Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem. On April 2, 2016, Barbieri died of pneumonia in New York City at the age of 83. On 25 June 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Gato Barbieri among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

The Ottoman administration granted further concessions and autonomy to the company, in managing the Port of Beirut, as it became an important harbour in Lebanon. In 1920, Lebanon came under French Administration, under the Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon, acting as Greater Lebanon. This provided the Port with access to French funding and trade. The Port of Beirut would be continue to be operated by the same French Company, which renamed the Gestion et Exploitation du Port de Beyrouth in 1960. Much of the port was damaged during the Lebanese Civil War, and various parts of the port were under the control of various armed militias.Elizabeth Picard, \\"The Political Economy of Civil War in Lebanon\\" in War, Institutions, and Social Change in the Middle East (ed.

He then toured for five years as aa member of the folksinging duo, The Saxons, before writing the music for and appearing in the off-Broadway musical Hark!.Dan Goggin, IMDbThe Official Nunsense Website: Goggin began composing both music and lyrics for revues satirizing current events, trends, and personalities. He later composed incidental music for the short-lived 1976 Broadway production, Legend, starring Elizabeth Ashley and F. Murray Abraham, which closed after five performances. Goggin's early life experiences, including schooling by the Marywood Dominican Sisters and his days as a seminarian, influenced him to create his greatest success. A line of greeting cards featuring a nun offering tart quips caught on so quickly that Goggin decided to expand the concept into a cabaret show called The Nunsense Story, which opened for a four-day run at Manhattan's Duplex and remained for 38 weeks, encouraging its creator to expand it into a full-length theater production.Off Broadway What followed was Nunsense (1985), one of off-Broadway's biggest commercial successes, which ran a total of 3672 performances. By the time it closed, it had become an international phenomenon translated into 21 languages with more than 5000 productions worldwide. Goggin followed it with six sequels, Nunsense 2: The Second Coming, Sister Amnesia's Country Western Nunsense Jamboree, Nuncrackers: The Nunsense Christmas Musical, Meshuggah-Nuns!, Nunsensations: The Nunsense Vegas Revue, and Nunset Boulevard. In 1998 Dan opened an all-male production of Nunsense entitled Nunsense A-Men! The show played in New York City to rave reviews.

Tu Shan and Asagao reveal that their children are all mortal despite the fact that they have two immortal parents. Wanderer convinces them to join him and Hanno in America. Hanno has been placing ads asking other immortals to join him. He has also founded a research team to find out how to grant immortality to everyone. *In the future, everyone is immortal, and the Immortals have long ago revealed themselves. There is no civil service, so Patulcius is no longer employable. Tu Shan has tried to return to a primitive life and failed, as there is no longer a market for his handicrafts. They, mostly Hanno, convince the government to build them a ship with which to explore the universe. *(some time later) They are on a near light speed ship to find other intelligent life. During the voyage, Hanno goes against the wishes of the crew and turns the ship in another direction. He spends an unspecified amount of time being ostracized by them for this. Immortal physiology As their name implies, at a certain point Immortals stop outwardly aging, generally at about twenty-five years, though apparently among east-Asians possibly a little later. When Immortals' teeth are damaged, they regrow. Immortals receive no permanent scars and also never contract contagious illnesses, even during times of plague. They remain fertile for as long as they live and can rapidly heal broken bones or other serious wounds. If the Immortal men are circumcised, their foreskins will regenerate. Speculation on \\"recurrent intactness\\" among women is left unanswered, with the possibility of the female hymen likewise restoring itself having been brought up at one point during dialogue in the novel. Immortals can and in the course of the novel do die, as they are not capable of recovering from injuries such as a stab to the heart or decapitation. There is also discussion about whether long-term exposure to tobacco smoke might present the possibility of lung cancer developing, though the researcher who opens the possibility admits he has no data on the matter.

Ellis' influence on the fashion industry has been called \\"a huge turning point\\" because he introduced new patterns and proportions to a market which was dominated by more traditional men's clothing. Early life Ellis was born in Portsmouth, Virginia, on March 3, 1940, the only child of Edwin and Winifred Rountree Ellis. His father owned a coal and home heating oil company, which enabled the family to live a comfortable middle-class life. Ellis graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in Portsmouth, Virginia, in 1957. He then studied at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, and graduated with a degree in business administration in 1961. To avoid the draft, Ellis enlisted in the United States Coast Guard Reserve with service that included six months of active duty with the Coast Guard. He graduated from New York University with a master's degree in retailing in 1963. Career Ellis started out in department store retailing in the Richmond, Virginia, area to gain experience in the fashion industry as a buyer and merchandiser at the department store Miller & Rhoads. While there, he was co- founder of Richmond retail shop A Sunny Day. He later joined the sportswear company John Meyer of Norwich in New York City. Eventually, in the mid-1970s, he was approached by his then employer, The Vera Companies, famous for their polyester double-knit pantsuits, to design a fashion collection for them. Soon after that, Ellis presented his first women's sportswear line, called Portfolio, in November 1976. Although he could not sketch, he knew exactly how the industry worked and proved a master of innovative ideas who created 'new classics' that American women longed for at the time. Ellis, together with The Vera Companies' parent company, Manhattan Industries, founded his own fashion house, Perry Ellis International, in 1978. He opened his showroom on New York's Seventh Avenue. As the company's chairman and head designer he later developed Perry Ellis Menswear Collection ‚Äì marked by \\"non-traditional, modern classics\\". Step by step, he added shoes, accessories, furs and perfume that all bear his name. Throughout the 1980s the company continued to expand and include various labels such as Perry Ellis Collection and Perry Ellis Portfolio. By 1982, the company had more than 75 staff. In 1984, Perry Ellis America was created in cooperation with Levi Strauss. In 1985, he revived his lesser-priced Portfolio product line. In the early 1980s, wholesale revenues had figured at about $60 million. By 1986 that number had risen to about $260 million. Highly praised professionally and personally, Ellis believed that \\"fashion dies when you take it too seriously.\\" Of Perry Ellis' fashion design, Michael Bastian remarked that \\"no one did it better...He was able to be modern and yet not come off antiseptic,\\" while Steven Kolb, CEO of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, described Ellis' fashion as \\"my way to step forward in fashion, but to still have a comfort level. It helped define my personality.\\" Ellis served as president of the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) from 1984 to 1986. Personal life In 1981, Ellis began a relationship with attorney Laughlin Barker.Morrisroe 1986 p.32 Later that year, Ellis appointed Barker the President of the licensing division of Perry Ellis International. They remained together until Barker's death in January 1986.Morrisroe 1986 p.36 In February 1984, Ellis and his long-time friend, television producer and writer Barbara Gallagher, conceived a child together via artificial insemination. Their daughter, Tyler Alexandra Gallagher Ellis, was born in November 1984. Ellis bought a home for Gallagher and their daughter in Brentwood, Los Angeles, and would visit frequently. In 2011, Tyler released her first line of handbags using the name Tyler Alexandra. Illness and death In October 1985, rumors that Ellis had contracted AIDS began to surface when he appeared on the runway at the end of his Fall fashion show. By that time, Ellis had lost a considerable amount of weight and looked much older. Around the same time, Ellis' partner Laughlin Barker was undergoing chemotherapy for Kaposi's sarcoma, an AIDS-related cancer that later metastasized to his lungs. Ellis continued to deny that he was sick, but rumors of his illness persisted after he passed out in the receiving line at a party at the Costume Institute in December 1985.Morrisroe 1986 pp.34-35 On January 2, 1986, Barker died of lung cancer at the couple's home in Manhattan. After Barker's death, Ellis' health rapidly declined. By May 1986, Ellis had contracted viral encephalitis which caused paralysis on one side of his face. Despite his appearance, he insisted on appearing at his Fall fashion show held in New York City on May 8. At the end of the show, Ellis attempted to walk the runway for his final bow but was so weak, he had to be supported by two assistants. It was his final public appearance. Ellis was hospitalized soon after and slipped into a coma.Morrisroe 1986 pp.36, 39 He died of viral encephalitis on May 30, 1986. A spokesperson for Ellis' company would not comment on whether the designer's death was AIDS-related stating, \\"Those were Perry's wishes.\\" Most newspapers omitted the AIDS rumors from Ellis' obituary and simply attributed his death to encephalitis. In August 1986, New York magazine writer Patricia Morrisroe wrote a story about Ellis where she concluded that, \\"...many people believe Ellis had AIDS, and given the evidence, it seems likely.\\" A 1993 article from the Associated Press included Ellis among its list of better known AIDS victims. Legacy In 1986, the annual Perry Ellis Award‚Äînow known as the Swarovski Emerging Talent Award‚Äîwas created to honor emerging talents in the world of men's and women's fashion designers. The first designer to receive it was David Cameron. Though he worked as a designer for less than a decade, over 25 years after his death his work is \\"still seen as incredibly influential.\\" In 1999, Miami-based textile company Supreme International purchased the Perry Ellis brand from Salant, a licensee of Perry Ellis that acquired it from Manhattan Industries in 1986. Supreme renamed itself Perry Ellis International and the company became traded on the NASDAQ under PERY. Perry Ellis International also owns and licenses other notable fashion brands, such as Original Penguin by Munsingwear, Cubavera, C&C; California, Rafaella, Laundry by Shelli Segal, Ben Hogan, Jantzen, Nike Swim and Callaway, among others. Moving into the twenty-first century, the Perry Ellis name has continued to expand. Building upon styles set forth by Ellis, the brand has successfully continued to grow, collaborate with other designers, such as Duckie Brown, and hold critical acclaim.

He established the soil mechanics course at Imperial College London, where the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department's building was renamed after him in 2004, and was knighted in the 2000 New Year Honours for services to engineering. He was also a notable contributor on the history of British civil engineering. Career Skempton was born in Northampton and attended Northampton grammar school. In 1932 Skempton he went to the City and Guilds College in London to study civil engineering. After beginning work on a Goldsmiths' Company bursary-funded PhD, he joined the Building Research Station (BRS) in 1936, initially working on reinforced concrete before moving to soil mechanics in 1937. The failure of an earth embankment for a reservoir at Chingford in north-east London helped highlight Skempton's insights on clay strata. Other projects included Waterloo Bridge, the Muirhead dam near Largs in Scotland, Gosport Dockyard and the Eau Brink Cut channel of the River Great Ouse near King's Lynn. In 1945, Skempton was seconded from BRS to establish a soil mechanics course at Imperial College (recruiting Alan W. Bishop as his first member of staff), becoming a full-time lecturer there in 1946, and introducing, in 1950, the first postgraduate course in soil mechanics. In 1955, he was elevated to the chair of soil mechanics, and from 1957 to 1976 was head of department and professor of civil engineering. He made great contributions in the field of quaternary geology and was widely consulted on problems involving landslips, foundations, retaining walls and embankments. Notable projects included the Mangla Dam in Pakistan and the Carsington Dam failure in Derbyshire in 1984. Research Skempton worked on many high- profile projects through his life, notably the back analysis of the Chingford reservoir failure (July 1937) and other embankment dams, including that at Chew Valley Lake, for which he designed an array of sand-drains to accelerate consolidation of the weak alluvial foundations, the first such in the UK. In situ behaviour of natural clays was of great interest to Skempton, who wrote two papers published by the Geological Society on the geological compaction of natural clays. Among other academic writings, he formulated concepts such as that of A and B pore water pressure coefficient which is still widely used today. Many of his research documents and other writing are available in the Skempton and Bishop Archives at Imperial College. He was a founding member of the Institution of Civil Engineers' Soil Mechanics and Foundations committee (now the British Geotechnical Association). Skempton was also an influential contributor to the history of civil engineering. He chaired the civil engineers archive panel at ICE where he edited works on William Jessop (1979), John Smeaton (1981), regarded as the founder of civil engineering, and early fen drainage engineer John Grundy, and started work on the first volume of A Biographical Dictionary of Civil Engineers of the British Isles, eventually published in 2002. Honours and awards=UK= Skempton was a member of the Links Club of the City and Guilds College whilst at Imperial College. He delivered the 4th Rankine Lecture titled Long-term stability of clay slopes in 1964. In recognition of his soil mechanics contributions, in 2004, the department of Civil & Environmental Engineering building at Imperial College was renamed after him: the Skempton Building. Other accolades included Fellow of the Royal Society (1961) and Founding Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. Skempton also accumulated medals from the ICE (the 1968 James Alfred Ewing Medal), the Geological Society (the 1972 Lyell Medal), Newcomen Society, and a gold medal from the Institution of Structural Engineers (IStructE). He was knighted for services to engineering in the 2000 New Year Honours. =International= Skempton was elected as the second President of the International Society of Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering, following Terzaghi, in 1957.

Since its founding in 1976 by Bill Kramer, Henry Posner, and David Tenney, Kramer's has become a local institution and meeting place for neighborhood residents, authors, and politicians. It was one of the first bookstores in the country to feature a cafe which influenced similar business models nationwide. Notable people that have visited Kramer's include Barack Obama, Andy Warhol, Maya Angelou, and Monica Lewinsky, whose purchases at the bookstore attracted national attention during the Lewinsky scandal investigation and led to a high-profile legal battle. Kramer's was sold in 2016 to Steve Salis. History=Early history= Kramerbooks, located at 1517 Connecticut Avenue NW in Washington, D.C.'s Dupont Circle neighborhood, opened in August 1976 by Bill Kramer, David Tenney, and Henry Posner. Two months later, the business partners opened Afterwords Cafe, with an entrance on 19th Street, in the same building. Constructed in 1920, the building was originally an automobile showroom. Later tenants included Hudson Air Conditioning Corporation and the women's clothing stores Looby and Peck & Peck. The bookstore was one of four in Washington, D.C. managed by Kramer, who had taken over the business from his parents, Sidney and Miriam Z. Kramer, librarians who opened their first store, Sidney Kramer Books, in 1946. Kramer wanted to open a business that provided customers a place to eat and read, what he described as \\"two of the three most enjoyable human activities.\\" At the time of its opening, there were few places in the country that provided such a service. The concept became popular and other businesses, including the Harvard Book Store and Square Books, followed Kramerbooks & Afterwords' lead and opened their own cafes. In its early history, Kramer's was open 24 hours and soon became a popular destination for neighborhood residents, authors, and politicians. It also earned a reputation as a place to meet a potential date. The New York Times described Kramer's as \\"one part bookstore, one part restaurant and perhaps one part singles bar.\\" According to Posner, Kramer's in part \\"helped establish a street life in Dupont Circle.\\" For many patrons, it was the first place where they had their \\"first real espresso and cappuccino, their first microbrews, their first taste of H√§agen-Dazs, their first decent bagels.\\" The owners would have fresh bagels from New York delivered to Washington, D.C.'s Greyhound station because they couldn't find any decent ones in the area. In 1984, Afterwords Cafe expanded by offering sidewalk seating on 19th Street. The business expanded again in 1991 when the adjoining building occupied by Cafe Splendide, 1521 Connecticut Avenue, was purchased. The expanded section included an enlarged bar. In 1993, the first of two branches opened in Arlington, Virginia. The store was three times the size of the Connecticut Avenue location and also included a restaurant. Both of the Arlington branches were unsuccessful and soon closed. =Lewinsky scandal= Kramer's came to national attention in 1998 during the Lewinsky scandal, when it successfully fought a subpoena from Kenneth Starr to disclose which books Monica Lewinsky had purchased. When the subpoena was first issued, it was reported Kramer's management would comply, although Kramer said that was not the case. The store was picketed by librarians, customers were upset, and sales dropped. Management chose to fight the subpoena with the help of several organizations, including the American Booksellers Association (ABA), American Library Association, and American Civil Liberties Union. In an interview, Kramer defended his actions citing the First Amendment and said \\"They are looking for us to hand over information about a specific customer's specific purchases, and that we will not do.\\" After U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson ordered Kramer's management to hand over the information to Starr, they declined and said they were ready to take the issue to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary. Kramer's management and Lewinsky's lawyers reached an agreement whereby the list of books she purchased would be given to Starr by her lawyers and not the bookstore, thereby protecting the store's integrity. The store's six-figure legal bills were paid in part by the ABA. =Later history and sale= Kramer's interior Despite the decline in the independent bookstore industry, Kramer's has continued to draw in customers looking for an intimate setting, live music, author events, and full bar. Kramer's is often called a Washington, D.C. institution and has been described as \\"iconic\\" and a \\"staple of the District's cultural scene.\\" Notable people that have visited Kramer's include President Barack Obama and his daughters who shopped at the store in 2011 on Small Business Saturday. Julia Louis-Dreyfus and John Slattery filmed a scene from the television series Veep in Kramer's. Other celebrities that have visited include Maya Angelou, Andy Warhol, Toni Morrison, and Margaret Cho. The shuttering of large chain bookstores, most notably the nearby Books-A-Million, proved to be a benefit to Kramer's although the increased number of trendy restaurants in the city affected the cafe's business. The cafe and bookstore bring in around the same amount of revenue, whereas before the cafe brought in more money. In 2015, the combined sales for the restaurant and cafe was $10 million. That same year Kramer and Tenney began plans to sell the business. Tenney said \\"I knew the business was viable, but I also knew the restaurant was beat up and tired. If we could find some way to resurrect and invigorate the restaurant, there would be a wonderful future ahead.\\" They were introduced to &pizza; co-founder Steve Salis and in 2016 it was announced Salis would purchase Kramer's with Tenney remaining as part-owner. In 2017, Salis became sole owner of the store. Salis oversaw an expansion and renovation of the business that included purchasing the adjoining building previously occupied by Willie T‚Äôs Lobster Shack. With the additional of retail space, the bookstore and cafe measure . In 2017, several longtime employees, including the general manager, events manager, and head buyer, quit after disagreements with Salis and opened a new bookstore on H Street NE later that year. In April 2020, Salis set up a pop-up take out and delivery of his BBQ sandwich franchise, the Federalist Pig, in the Afterwords Cafe. Salis announced in May 2020 that he intended to relocate Kramerbooks and Afterwords Cafe to an undisclosed location. The local community responded with regret and grief. Salis later clarified he would keep the bookstore at its original location for at least three more years. In August 2020, he changed the name of Afterwords Cafe to All Day by Kramers, with a menu designed by Chef Vincent Griffith.

The poem describes an engagement between the Clampherdown, a fictional Royal Navy battleship, and a light cruiser of indeterminate origin; she is described as \\"of the ancient foe\\", and carrying \\"a dainty Hotchkiss gun\\", which implies the French navy. After the Clampherdowns guns fail to sink the cruiser, and she drifts aimlessly being shelled, she collides with the cruiser, and her crew \\"out cutlasses, and board!\\" the enemy. It was inspired by a letter written to the St James's Gazette, whose author \\"seemed to believe that naval warfare of the future would be conducted on the old Nelsonic battle lines, including boarding, etc.\\", to quote Kipling's explanation. He wrote the poem as a deliberate humorous play on this idea; however, to his surprise, it was taken quite seriously and published. Whilst boarding did never return as a major part of naval warfare, it did occur occasionally. The last major boarding action by the Royal Navy was the Altmark incident, in 1940, complete with cutlass-wielding Royal Marines. The Clampherdown is described in some detail in the poem, allowing some comparison to be made to real vessels. Whilst the name is similar to HMS Camperdown, the physical description‚Äî\\"one bow-gun of a hundred ton / and a great stern-gun beside\\"‚Äîis closer to that of her sister ship the Benbow, which was built with an experimental armament. Both were Admiral class battleships, pre-dreadnoughts launched in the 1880s. The 16.25‚Ä≥ guns of Benbow, the largest and most powerful then fitted to a Royal Navy battleship, were not greatly successful in service; they took four or five minutes to load and fire, the barrels only had a life of 75 rounds, and the muzzles tended to droop. The ships of this class were only partially armoured, with the bow and stern being lightly protected, and had low freeboard; these factors are noted and reflected in the text. In 1892, Benbow had recently been removed from active service and was serving as a guard ship at Greenock; the defects in her design would have been clear by this point.

She earned her undergraduate degree from Washington University in St. LouisJohn McGuire (September 8, 2004). \\"The Spy who Loved it.\\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch', p. E1 and her MA in Russian and East European Studies as well as her Ph.D. in political science from the University of Michigan. When living as a student in Europe, she claims to have engaged in the black market between East and West, running Cuban rum, smuggling jewels from the Soviet Union and laundering East Bloc currencies. She claims to have been recruited by the East German secret police, the Stasi, and by the Libyan Intelligence Service. Some sources assert that she was an American intelligence officer,(McGuire, 2004; Adler, 2004) but Hillhouse denies this.(Nolan, 2004) Hillhouse was born in the Ozarks and currently lives in Hawaii. Blog Hillhouse writes a national security blogThe Spy Who Billed Me blog which has broken multiple national security stories. Her work has been extensively cited in global media, books and academic journals and law reviews. In 2007 the New York Times Week in Review republished excerpts from an exclusive interview from Hillhouse's blog with the head of the private military corporation Blackwater USA. In June 2007, Hillhouse discovered the US national Intelligence Community budget metadata in a declassified PowerPoint presentation released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Hillhouse broke international news stories on national security risks caused by the explosion in outsourcing governmental intelligence functions. Hillhouse's controversial articles have twice elicited a response from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence‚Äîthe only times the office of the nation's chief spy has ever publicly responded to the writings of a private citizen. Her most controversial work involved an account of the death of Osama bin Laden. Death of Bin Laden Report On August 7, 2011 Hillhouse published an account of Osama bin Laden's death on her blog that suggested Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) had been sheltering bin Laden in return for Saudi cash and that he was betrayed by a Pakistani intelligence officer. Hillhouse's sources claimed that the narrative given by the White House of the courier revealing the location of bin Laden was a cover story, created to hide involvement of US allies in sheltering bin Laden. According to The Telegraph, Hillhouse's account might explain why U.S. forces encountered no resistance on their way to and in Abbottabad, and why some residents in Abbottabad were warned to stay in their houses the day before the raid. Hillhouse's 2011 story received widespread international attention and was picked up by the Daily Telegraph, The Daily Mail, the National Post, The Vancouver Sun, The Sydney Morning Herald, The New Zealand Herald and others, but had little coverage in the US. Controversy with Seymour Hersh over Death of Bin Laden Report In May 2015, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist Seymour Hersh published a report in the London Review of Books in which he claimed to break the story of bin Laden's death. His claims mirrored the one's Hillhouse had raised four years earlier. The New York Times, Washington Post and other global media acknowledged that Hillhouse wrote about the events years before Hersh, although Hersh denied ever having seen Hillhouse's account. Media suggested that Hillhouse and Hersh's stories appeared to be based on different sources and The Intercept concluded that they might corroborate each other if the identities of the sources were known. After the Hersh story broke, major news outlets confirmed portions of Hillhouse's original story. NBC News also independently reported that a Pakistani intelligence officer was the source of the original bin Laden location report, and not the courier. NBC News and Agence France-Presse both reported that their sources indicated that a walk-in was a highly valuable asset in the discovery of bin Laden. Pakistan-based journalist Amir Mir in the News International reported the walk-in's identity to be Usman Khalid, though that allegation was denied by Khalid's family. Publications=Articles= She has also published stories on national security in the Washington PostWashington Post and The Nation. In the controversial Washington Post article, Hillhouse wrote that \\"the private spy industry has succeeded where no foreign government has: It has penetrated the CIA and is running the show.\\" In the Nation article, Hillhouse revealed that private companies are heavily involved in the nation‚Äôs most important and most sensitive national security document ‚Äî the President‚Äôs Daily Brief.

The town is perched above a precipitous cliff with a splendid view over the Pomptine Marshes below; the highest point stands to ca. 460 meters (over 1500 feet) above sea level. Map of Norba History Norba was a member of the Latin League of 499 BC. It became a Roman colony in 492 BC, initially to protect the border with the Volsci,Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2:34 and later serving as an important fortress guarding the Pomptine Marshes. It served in 199 BC as a place of detention for the Carthaginian hostages, and was captured and destroyed by Sulla's troops during the civil wars at the end of 82 BC. By the first century AD Norba is included by Pliny the Elder on his list of extinct cities in Latium.http://latin.packhum.org/loc/978/1/240/171-177#240 Historia Naturalis 3.69.1 A polygonal masonry temple podium on the Minor Acropolis of ancient Norba.

The well-preserved walls are in the polygonal style, over 2.5 km in circuit, and are entirely embankment walls, not standing free above the internal ground level. The walls enclose an area of approximately 38 hectares. Remains of two towers, and of several gateways (notably the Porta Maggiore, defended by a tower), exist. The bastion at the Porta Maggiore still stands to 13 m.

Within, the remains of several, buildings, including the foundations (podia) of two temples, one dedicated to Juno Lucina, have been examined. At the foot of the cliff are the picturesque ruins of the medieval town of Ninfa, (12th-13th centuries) abandoned on account of malaria. The remains of a primitive settlement, on the other hand, have been discovered on the mountainside to the southeast, above the 13th- century abbey of Valvisciolo, where there is a succession of terraces supported by walls of rough polygonal masonry, and approached by a road similarly supported.

It tells the story of Zadig, a philosopher in ancient Babylonia. The author does not attempt any historical accuracy, and some of the problems Zadig faces are thinly disguised references to social and political problems of Voltaire's own day. It was originally published as Memnon in Amsterdam (with a false imprint of London given) and first issued under its more familiar title in 1748. The book makes use of the Persian tale The Three Princes of Serendip. It is philosophical in nature, and presents human life as in the hands of a destiny beyond human control. Voltaire challenges religious and metaphysical orthodoxy with his presentation of the moral revolution taking place in Zadig himself. Zadig is one of Voltaire's most celebrated works after Candide. Many literary critics have praised Voltaire's use of contradiction and juxtaposition. Characters * Zadig - The protagonist, a Babylonian philosopher. * S√©mire - Zadig's original love interest. * Orcan - Zadig's rival for S√©mire and nephew of a certain Minister of State. * Azora - Zadig's second love interest. * Cador - Zadig's confident and faithful friend. * Moabdar - The King of Babylon. * Astart√© - Queen of Babylon, Zadig's final love interest. * S√©toc - An Egyptian merchant and Zadig's master while he is enslaved. * Almona - A widow. * Arbogad - A brigand. * Jesrad - An angel who disguises himself as a retired philosopher and hermitThis character is directly inspired from Al-Khidr, a mysterious character referred to in the Quran, in Sura \\"The Cave\\" (Al-Kahf), v. 65‚Äì82. Known as Al-Khidr (meaning \\"The Green One\\"), he appears as a wise man holding great knowledge of the unknown and who Moses is going to follow through a journey. Plot summary Zadig, a good-hearted, handsome young man from Babylonia, is in love with S√©mire and they are to marry. S√©mire, however, has another suitor: Orcan, who wants her for himself. Zadig tries to defend his love from Orcan's threat, but his eye is injured in the process. S√©mire abhors this injury, causing her to depart with his enemy. Shortly after, Zadig makes a full recovery and falls into the arms of another woman, Azora, whom he marries, but who promptly betrays him. Disillusioned with women, Zadig turns to science, but his knowledge lands him in prison, the first of several injustices to befall him. Indeed, the conte derives its pace and rhythm from the protagonist's ever-changing fortunes which see him rise to great heights and fall to great lows. Upon his release from prison, Zadig rises in favour with the king and queen of Babylonia and is eventually appointed prime minister; in this role, he proves himself to be a very honest man, looked upon favourably by the king, as he passes fair judgements on his citizens unlike the other ministers who base their judgements on the people's wealth. He is forced to flee the kingdom, though, when his relationship with King Moabdar is compromised: Zadig's reciprocated love for queen Astart√© is discovered and he worries that the king's desire for revenge might drive him to kill the queen. Having reached Egypt, Zadig kills an Egyptian man while valiantly saving a woman from his attack on her. Under the law of the land, this crime means that he must become a slave. His new master, S√©toc, is soon impressed by Zadig's wisdom and they become friends. In one incident, Zadig manages to reverse an ancient custom of certain tribes in which women felt obliged to burn themselves alive with their husbands on the death of the latter. After attempting to resolve other religious disputes, Zadig enrages local clerics who attempt to have him killed. Fortunately for him, though, a woman that he saved (Almona) from being burned intervenes so that he avoids death. Almona marries S√©toc, who in turn gives Zadig his freedom and then he begins his journey back to Babylonia in order to discover what has become of Astart√©. (In some versions there is a further episode in which he visits Serendib and advises the king on the choice of a treasurer and a wife.) En route, he is taken captive by a group of Arabs, from whom he learns that king Moabdar has been killed, but he does not learn anything of what has become of Astart√©. Arbogad, the leader of the group of Arabs, sets him free and he heads for Babylonia once more, equipped with the knowledge that a rebellion has taken place to oust the king. On this journey he meets an unhappy fisherman who is about to commit suicide as he has no money, but Zadig gives him some money to ease his woes, telling us that source of his own unhappiness is in his heart, whereas the fisherman's are only financial concerns. Zadig prevents him from committing suicide and he continues on his way. Zadig then stumbles upon a meadow in which women are searching for a basilisk for their lord who is ill, ordered by his doctor to find one of these rare animals to cure his sickness. The lord has promised to marry the woman who finds the basilisk. While there, Zadig sees a woman writing \\"ZADIG\\" in the ground, and he identifies her as Astart√©. His former lover recounts what happened to her since Zadig fled Babylonia: she lived inside a statue when he left, but one day, she spoke while her husband was praying before the statue. The king's country was invaded and both Astart√© and his new wife, Missouf, were taken prisoners by the same group. The king's wife agrees to formulate a plan along with Astart√© to help her escape so that she would not have a rival for the king. Astart√© ends up with Arbogad, the very same robber that Zadig encountered, who then sold her to Lord Ogul, her current master. In order to secure Astart√©'s release from Ogul, Zadig pretends to be a physician. He offers Lord Ogul to bring him a basilisk if he grants Astart√© her freedom; instead of providing the basilisk, the lord is tricked into taking some exercise, which is what he really needs to cure him from his illness. Astart√© returns to Babylonia where she is pronounced queen before a competition begins to find her a new king. Zadig is secretly given white armor and a fine horse to compete with by Astart√©. Zadig in his white armor triumphs in the contest which takes place between four anonymous knights, but one of the losing competitors, the lord Itobad, steals Zadig's armour and replaces it with his own before the winner is revealed, and dressed in Zadig's armor falsely claims victory. Zadig is forced to wear Itobad's armor and is recognized as the losing knight by the people. Zadig is ridiculed and bemoans his fate, thinking that he will never be happy. While wandering on the banks of the Euphrates, Zadig encounters a hermit reading \\"the book of destinies\\". Zadig makes a vow to accompany the hermit for the next few days on the condition that he won't abandon the hermit no matter what he does. The hermit claims that he will teach Zadig lessons in life; in one such incident, the pair go to an opulent castle and are treated generously. The lord of the castle gives each of them a gold piece before sending them off. After leaving, Zadig finds that the hermit has stolen the gold basin that the lord allowed them to wash in. Afterwards, they visit the house of a miser and are treated somewhat rudely by the servant and are pushed to leave, but the hermit gives the servant the two gold pieces from the lord and gives the miser the gold basin he stole. The aim, he tells Zadig, is that the hospitable man at the castle will learn not to be as ostentatious and vain, and the miser will learn how to treat guests. They then arrive at the simple home of a retired philosopher who welcomed the travelers in. The philosopher talks of the fight for the crown in Babylonia, revealing that he wished Zadig had fought for the crown not knowing that Zadig is one of his two guests. In the morning, at dawn, the hermit wakes Zadig to leave. To Zadig's horror, the hermit sets fire to the philosopher's home. In the last encounter, Zadig and the hermit stay with a widow and her young nephew. After their stay the boy accompanies the travelers to the bridge by the widow's orders. At the bridge, the hermit asks the boy to come to him. He then throws the fourteen- year-old into the river drowning him, as he claims that Providence tells that he would have killed his aunt within a year, and Zadig within two. The hermit then reveals his true identity as the angel Jesrad, and opines that Zadig, out of all men, deserves to be best informed about Fate. Jesrad states that wickedness is necessary to maintain the order of the world and to ensure that good survives. Nothing happens by chance, according to the angel: Zadig happened upon the fisherman to save his life, for example. Zadig should be submissive to Fate, he continues, and should return to Babylonia, advice which he follows. (Surprisingly, regarding Voltaire's hostility towards religions, this passage is based on one of the suras of the Quran (Sura 18 (Al-Kahf), v. 65‚Äì82), when Moses follows a mysterious character, endowed with great knowledge, through his journey.)Pierre Larcher, \\"Voltaire, Zadig et le Coran\\". On his return, the final part of the challenge to be king is taking place: the Enigmas. Zadig solves the Enigmas with consummate ease and proves that it was he that won the first contest by challenging Itobad once again to a duel. Zadig offers to fight wearing only his robes and armed with a sword against Itobad clad in the stolen white armor. Itobad accepts this challenge. Zadig manages to defeat Itobad, and takes back the stolen armor. Zadig marries Astart√©, is crowned king, and rules over a prosperous kingdom.  Influence  The detective work portrayed in Zadig was influential. Marquis de Sade refers directly to Voltaire's work in the first pages of Justine ou les Malheurs de la vertu, 1791.French Wikisource Georges Cuvier wrote, in 1834, in the context of the new science of paleontology: T. H. Huxley, the proponent of Darwin's theories of evolution, also found Zadig's approach instructive, and wrote in his 1880 article \\"On the Method of Zadig\\": Edgar Allan Poe may have been inspired by Zadig when he created C. Auguste Dupin in \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\\", which Poe called a \\"tale of ratiocination\\" and which established the modern detective fiction genre. √âmile Gaboriau and Arthur Conan Doyle were perhaps also influenced by Zadig. As Barzun and Taylor put it in A Catalogue of Crime: \\"However implausible and \\"agrarian\\" his method, he is the first systematic detective in modern literature, and that priority itself adds to his troubles in the story until his royal vindication.\\"Barzun, Jacques and Taylor, Wendell Hertig. A Catalogue of Crime. New York: Harper & Row. 1971, revised and enlarged edition 1989. The text also influenced the Icelandic romance-saga Fimmbr√¶√∞ra saga, whose author, J√≥n Oddsson Hjaltal√≠n, also adapted Zadig itself into Icelandic.Fj√≥rar s√∂gur fr√° hendi J√≥ns Oddssonar Hjaltal√≠n, ed. by M.

The church has been used over its history by several Christian denominations, including Baptists, the First African Methodist Episcopal Church, and Unitarian Universalist. In the 1980s, it was renovated and adapted for use as office space, with the exterior restored and preserved.

In the years before the American Civil War, it was a stronghold of the anti-slavery movement, and was the site of notable speeches from such anti-slavery activists as Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips, Harriet Tubman, and Sojourner Truth.

It was briefly used as an Albanian Orthodox church before the Society granted the building in 1947 to the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities.

It served as a Universalist Church of America church from 1949 to 1961, and as Unitarian Universalist after consolidation, from 1961 to 1978/1979. This was a Universalist experimental church. In 1979, the building was sold to a private owner.Mark A. Bower, ‚ÄúPutting Offices in the Sanctuary: Utilizing Rehabilitation Tax Credits for Adaptive Reuse of Religious Buildings,‚Äù Inspired, Mar-Apr 1989: p.4-6, 8, 16-17. At that time, the Society negotiated a specific preservation easement with the owner. The Meeting House is a recognized site on the Boston Black Heritage Trail and located in the Beacon Hill Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The nineteenth-century altered sanctuary was relatively intact, but much of the rest of the interior held little architectural significance in comparison with the exterior. The National Park Service permitted extensive vertical and horizontal internal subdivision, provided that the developer incorporate some existing ornamental features. In 1980 the Meeting House was purchased by the Charles Street Meeting House Associates. This group intended to restore the exterior and find viable, compatible uses for the interior spaces. Exterior restoration and interior renovation for office, retail, and residential uses commenced in the fall of 1981. Construction and occupancy were completed in the summer of 1982. The meeting house was converted in the early 1980s by the architectural firm of John Sharrat Associates into four floors of offices, with retail on the ground floor. The exterior was completely preserved.William C. Shopsin. Restoring Old Building for Contemporary Uses: An American Sourcebook for Architects and Preservationists.

On 11 December 2019 it was announced he will take over as CEO of the over-50s insurance company, Saga. He took up his role on 6 January 2020. Career After training in marketing with Coca-Cola, he worked in marketing a retail management positions with Mars Confectionery, Matalan, Currys and Superdrug. He then joined Kingfisher plc, rising to the position of chief operating officer. =Co-operative Group= Touted as a replacement for Kingfisher CEO Ian Cheshire, he joined the Co-operative Group in April 2013, taking over from Peter Marks as chief executive. Due to inadequate capital levels in its banking group, Moody's downgraded the bank's credit rating by six notches to junk status (Ba3) and the bank's chief executive Barry Tootell resigned. The difficulties stemmed largely from the commercial loans of the Britannia Building Society, acquired in the 2009 merger. Sutherland restructured, by intending to sell the life insurance business to Royal London releasing about ¬£200m in capital, and planning to dispose of its other insurance business. On 5 June Richard Pennycook, former finance director of Morrisons, was named Co- operative Group's finance director, and Richard Pym, former chief executive of the Alliance & Leicester bank, as chair of the Co-operative Banking Group and the Co-operative Bank. In March 2014, Sutherland resigned from The Co- operative because he said \\"I now feel that until the Group adopts professional and commercial governance it will be impossible to implement what my team and I believe are the necessary changes and reforms to renew the Group and give it a relevant and sustainable future\\". He was replaced by Richard Pennycook, then chief financial officer, who became the group's interim Chief Executive. =Supergroup= On 22 October 2014, it was announced that Sutherland was CEO of SuperGroup plc. On 2 April 2019, Sutherland resigned as CEO of SuperGroup plc after founder Julian Dunkerton won a bid to be reinstated to the SuperGroup plc board. = Saga = In December 2019, Saga employs Euan Sutherland, longtime leader of Superdry and Co-op, as chief executive. At a crucial moment he joined with Saga. The insurance firm, which accounts for the overwhelming majority of the group 's earnings, has needed to dramatically slash premiums to stay profitable.

The zenana are the inner apartments of a house in which the women of the family live. The outer apartments for guests and men are called the mardana. Conceptually in those that practise purdah, it is the equivalent in the Indian subcontinent of the harem. Christian missionaries were able to gain access to these Indian girls and women through the zenana missions; female missionaries who had been trained as doctors and nurses were able to provide them with health care and also evangelise them in their own homes.  Mughal court life  Physically, the zenana of the Mughal court consisted of exceptionally luxurious conditions, particularly for princesses and women associated to high-ranking figures. Because of the extreme restrictions placed on access to the women's quarters, very few reliable accounts of their description are available. Still, modern scholars evaluating court records and travelogues contemporary with the Mughal period detail the women's lodgings as offering courtyards, ponds, fountains and gardens. The palaces themselves were decorated with mirrors, paintings and marble. Jahanara, daughter of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal, famously lived in her own apartment decorated with valuable carpets, and murals of flying angels. Other amenities depicted in illustrations of court life include running water and meticulous gardens. = Resident population = Rather than being the prison-like space of licentious activity popularized by European imagination (see Orientalism), the zenana functioned as the domain of female members of the household, ranging from wives to concubines to widows, unmarried sisters and cousins, and even further distant relations who were considered dependent kin. In addition to the women of rank, the zenana was populated by attendants of various skill and purpose to provide for the needs of the ladies residing within. All visiting friends, servants, and entertainers were invariably female, down to the highly trained corps of armed women ‚Äî guards known as urdubegis ‚Äî assigned to escort and protect the women in the zenana. Fortified entrance to the zenana at Fatehpur Sikri. = Administration = According to Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak, author of the Akbarnama, the zenana of Akbar the Great at Fatehpur Sikri was home to more than five thousand women, who had each been given her own suite of rooms. The size of the zenana meant that it was a community unto itself, and it thus required systematic administration to maintain; all of these administrators were female. Abu'l Fadl describes the zenana as being divided into sections, with daroghas appointed to tend to the financial and organizational needs of the residents. Other administrative positions included the tehwildar, or accounts officer, responsible for the salaries and financial requests of the inhabitants. Then there were the mahaldars, the female servant of highest authority chosen from within the ranks of the daroghas, who often acted as an intelligence source from the zenana directly to the emperor. The royal anagas (the Turki language word used at the Mughal court for wetnurses),DƒÄYASORANƒÄGAS OF IMPERIAL MUGHAL. Balkrishan Shivram. Proceedings of the Indian History Congress Vol. 74 (2013), pp. 258-268. Published by: Indian History Congress. https://www.jstor.org/stable/44158824 were elevated to positions of rank, though their purpose was not strictly administrative. = Political influence = It was because male members of Mughal society did not closely define the concept of purdah as a reflection of their own honor that wives, daughters, and particularly unmarried women in the upper-echelons of the empire were able to extend their influence beyond the physical structures of the zenana. That less-constrictive interpretation of purdah allowed the ladies of the Mughal court to indirectly participate in public life, most notably in civic building projects. Jahanara herself was responsible for the major alteration of Shahjahanabad, by constructing the now famous Chandni Chowk market. Altogether, wives, daughters, and even a courtesan were the primary patrons to 19 major structures in the city. Owing to the cultural precedent set by their Timurid ancestors, it was comparatively more acceptable for Mughal women to perform civic charity in the form of building projects and even engage in leisure activities outside the zenana like hunting, polo and pilgrimage, than it would have been for their Safavid contemporaries. Nur Jahan seems to be unique in that she had a particular affinity for hunting, and was able to gain permission to accompany her husband Jahangir on several outings, even once killing four tigers easily with her excellent marksmanship. = Adherence to purdah = Despite the social freedom that came with being a member of the royal household, Mughal women did not go about unveiled and were not seen by outsiders or men other than their family. Instead, when they traveled they covered their heads and faces in white veils, and they were transported in howdahs, chaudoles, carriages and palanquins with covering on all sides, to maintain the modesty and seclusion required of purdah. When entering or exiting the zenana itself, female pall bearers carried their palanquins, and they were only transferred to male servants and eunuchs outside the walls of the zenana. Should outsiders be required to enter the zenana, as in the case of an illness where the lady could not be moved for her health, the visitor was covered from head to foot in a shroud and led blindly to the lady by a eunuch escort.

With membranes that contain large concentrations of ion channels, transporters, and pumps, T-tubules permit rapid transmission of the action potential into the cell, and also play an important role in regulating cellular calcium concentration. Through these mechanisms, T-tubules allow heart muscle cells to contract more forcefully by synchronising calcium release throughout the cell. T-tubule structure may be affected by disease, potentially contributing to heart failure and arrhythmias. Although these structures were first seen in 1897, research into T-tubule biology is ongoing. Structure T-tubules are tubules formed from the same phospholipid bilayer as the surface membrane or sarcolemma of skeletal or cardiac muscle cells. They connect directly with the sarcolemma at one end before travelling deep within the cell, forming a network of tubules with sections running both perpendicular (transverse) to and parallel (axially) to the sarcolemma. Due to this complex orientation, some refer to T-tubules as the transverse-axial tubular system. The inside or lumen of the T-tubule is open at the cell surface, meaning that the T-tubule is filled with fluid containing the same constituents as the solution that surrounds the cell (the extracellular fluid). Rather than being just a passive connecting tube, the membrane that forms T-tubules is highly active, being studded with proteins including L-type calcium channels, sodium-calcium exchangers, calcium ATPases and Beta adrenoceptors. T-tubules are found in both atrial and ventricular cardiac muscle cells (cardiomyocytes), in which they develop in the first few weeks of life. They are found in ventricular muscle cells in most species, and in atrial muscle cells from large mammals. In cardiac muscle cells, T-tubules are between 20 and 450 nanometers in diameter and are usually located in regions called Z-discs where the actin filaments anchor within the cell. T-tubules within the heart are closely associated with the intracellular calcium store known as the sarcoplasmic reticulum in specific regions referred to as terminal cisternae. The association of the T-tubule with a terminal cistern is known as a diad. In skeletal muscle cells, T-tubules are between 20 and 40 nm in diameter and are typically located either side of the myosin strip, at the junction of overlap between the A and I bands. T-tubules in skeletal muscle are associated with two terminal cisternae, known as a triad. = Regulators = The shape of the T-tubule system is produced and maintained by a variety of proteins. The protein amphiphysin-2 is encoded by the gene BIN1 and is responsible for forming the structure of the T-tubule and ensuring that the appropriate proteins (in particular L-type calcium channels) are located within the T-tubule membrane. Junctophilin-2 is encoded by the gene JPH2 and helps to form a junction between the T-tubule membrane and the sarcoplasmic reticulum, vital for excitation-contraction coupling. Titin capping protein or Telethonin is encoded by the gene TCAP and helps with T-tubule development and is potentially responsible for the increasing number of T-tubules seen as muscles grow.  Function =Excitation-contraction coupling= T-tubules are an important link in the chain from electrical excitation of a cell to its subsequent contraction (excitation-contraction coupling). When contraction of a muscle is needed, stimulation from a nerve or an adjacent muscle cell causes a characteristic flow of charged particles across the cell membrane known as an action potential. At rest, there are fewer positively charged particles on the inner side of the membrane compared to the outer side, and the membrane is described as being polarised. During an action potential, positively charged particles (predominantly sodium and calcium ions) flow across the membrane from the outside to the inside. This reverses the normal imbalance of charged particles and is referred to as depolarisation. One region of membrane depolarises adjacent regions, and the resulting wave of depolarisation then spreads along the cell membrane. The polarisation of the membrane is restored as potassium ions flow back across the membrane from the inside to the outside of the cell. In cardiac muscle cells, as the action potential passes down the T-tubules it activates L-type calcium channels in the T-tubular membrane. Activation of the L-type calcium channel allows calcium to pass into the cell. T-tubules contain a higher concentration of L-type calcium channels than the rest of the sarcolemma and therefore the majority of the calcium that enters the cell occurs via T-tubules. This calcium binds to and activates a receptor, known as a ryanodine receptor, located on the cell's own internal calcium store, the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Activation of the ryanodine receptor causes calcium to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing the muscle cell to contract. In skeletal muscle cells, however, the L-type calcium channel is directly attached to the ryanodine receptor on the sarcoplasmic reticulum allowing activation of the ryanodine receptor directly without the need for an influx of calcium. The importance of T-tubules is not solely due to their concentration of L-type calcium channels, but lies also within their ability to synchronise calcium release within the cell. The rapid spread of the action potential along the T-tubule network activates all of the L-type calcium channels near-simultaneously. As T-tubules bring the sarcolemma very close to the sarcoplasmic reticulum at all regions throughout the cell, calcium can then be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum across the whole cell at the same time. This synchronisation of calcium release allows muscle cells to contract more forcefully. In cells lacking T-tubules such as smooth muscle cells, diseased cardiomyocytes, or muscle cells in which T-tubules have been artificially removed, the calcium that enters at the sarcolemma has to diffuse gradually throughout the cell, activating the ryanodine receptors much more slowly as a wave of calcium leading to less forceful contraction. As the T-tubules are the primary location for excitation-contraction coupling, the ion channels and proteins involved in this process are concentrated here - there are 3 times as many L-type calcium channels located within the T-tubule membrane compared to the rest of the sarcolemma. Furthermore, beta adrenoceptors are also highly concentrated in the T-tubular membrane, and their stimulation increases calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. = Calcium control = As the space within the lumen of the T-tubule is continuous with the space that surrounds the cell (the extracellular space), ion concentrations between the two are very similar. However, due to the importance of the ions within the T-tubules (particularly calcium in cardiac muscle), it is very important that these concentrations remain relatively constant. As the T-tubules are very thin, they essentially trap the ions. This is important as, regardless of the ion concentrations elsewhere in the cell, T-tubules still have enough calcium ions to permit muscle contraction. Therefore, even if the concentration of calcium outside the cell falls (hypocalcaemia), the concentration of calcium within the T-tubule remains relatively constant, allowing cardiac contraction to continue. As well as T-tubules being a site for calcium entry into the cell, they are also a site for calcium removal. This is important as it means that calcium levels within the cell can be tightly controlled in a small area (i.e. between the T-tubule and sarcoplasmic reticulum, known as local control).Hinch, R., Greenstein, J.L., Tanskanen, A.J., Xu, L. and Winslow, R.L. (2004) ‚ÄòA simplified local control model of calcium-induced calcium release in cardiac ventricular Myocytes‚Äô, 87(6). Proteins such as the sodium-calcium exchanger and the sarcolemmal ATPase are located mainly in the T-tubule membrane. The sodium- calcium exchanger passively removes one calcium ion from the cell in exchange for three sodium ions. As a passive process it can therefore allow calcium to flow into or out of the cell depending on the combination of the relative concentrations of these ions and the voltage across the cell membrane (the electrochemical gradient). The calcium ATPase removes calcium from the cell actively, using energy derived from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). = Detubulation = In order to study T-tubule function, T-tubules can be artificially uncoupled from the surface membrane using a technique known as detubulation. Chemicals such as glycerol or formamide (for skeletal and cardiac muscle respectively) can be added to the extracellular solution that surrounds the cells. These agents increase the osmolarity of the extracellular solution, causing the cells to shrink. When these agents are withdrawn, the cells rapidly expand and return to their normal size. This shrinkage and re- expansion of the cell causes T-tubules to detach from the surface membrane. Alternatively, the osmolarity of the extracellular solution can be decreased, using for example hypotonic saline, causing a transient cell swelling. Returning the extracellular solution to a normal osmolarity allows the cells to return to their previous size, again leading to detubulation.  History  The idea of a cellular structure that later became known as a T-tubule was first proposed in 1881. The very brief time lag between stimulating a striated muscle cell and its subsequent contraction was too short to have been caused by a signalling chemical travelling the distance between the sarcolemma and the sarcoplasmic reticulum. It was therefore suggested that pouches of membrane reaching into the cell might explain the very rapid onset of contraction that had been observed. It took until 1897 before the first T-tubules were seen, using light microscopy to study cardiac muscle injected with India ink. Imaging technology advanced, and with the advent of transmission electron microscopy the structure of T-tubules became more apparent leading to the description of the longitudinal component of the T-tubule network in 1971. In the 1990s and 2000s confocal microscopy enabled three-dimensional reconstruction of the T-tubule network and quantification of T-tubule size and distribution, and the important relationships between T-tubules and calcium release began to be unravelled with the discovery of calcium sparks. While early work focussed on ventricular cardiac muscle and skeletal muscle, in 2009 an extensive T-tubule network in atrial cardiac muscle cells was observed. Ongoing research focusses on the regulation of T-tubule structure and how T-tubules are affected by and contribute to cardiovascular diseases. Clinical significance The structure of T-tubules can be altered by disease, which in the heart may contribute to weakness of the heart muscle or abnormal heart rhythms. The alterations seen in disease range from a complete loss of T-tubules to more subtle changes in their orientation or branching patterns. T-tubules may be lost or disrupted following a myocardial infarction, and are also disrupted in the ventricles of patients with heart failure, contributing to reduced force of contraction and potentially decreasing the chances of recovery. Heart failure can also cause the near-complete loss of T-tubules from atrial cardiomyocytes, reducing atrial contractility and potentially contributing to atrial fibrillation. Structural changes in T-tubules can lead to the L-type calcium channels moving away from the ryanodine receptors. This can increase the time taken for calcium levels within the cell to rise leading to weaker contractions and arrhythmias. However, disordered T-tubule structure may not be permanent, as some suggest that T-tubule remodelling might be reversed through the use of interval training.

It is the widest valley south of the Inn Valley () and lends its name to the Zillertal Alps, the strongly glaciated section of the Alps in which it lies. The Tux Alps lie to its west, while the lower grass peaks of the Kitzb√ºhel Alps are found to the east. The Ziller Valley is one of the valley areas in Tyrol most visited by tourists. Its largest settlement is Mayrhofen.  Geography  Zillertal Alps: south face of Olperer The Ziller Valley branches from the Inn trench near Jenbach, about 40 km northeast of Innsbruck, running mostly in a north-south direction. The Ziller Valley proper stretches from the village of Strass to Mayrhofen, where it separates into four smaller valleys, the Tux valley and the sparsely settled, so-called Gr√ºnde ‚Äì Zamsergrund, Zillergrund and Stilluppgrund. Along the way, two more Gr√ºnde and the Gerlos valley, which leads to the Gerlos Pass and into Salzburg, branch off. Unlike other side valleys of the Inntal, the Ziller Valley rises constantly, but only marginally, from one end to the other ‚Äì only about 100 m over 30 km. Permanent settlements cover about 9% of the entire area of the Ziller Valley municipalities.  History  Near the Tuxer Joch, a pass between the Wipptal and the Tux valley, there have been archeological finds from middle Stone Age. The oldest remains of settlements in the Ziller Valley date back to the Illyrians during the late Bronze and early Iron Ages ‚Äì a tribe from the Balkan Peninsula who were absorbed by the Bavarians (Baiuvarii). The earliest written record of the Ziller Valley dates from 889, when Arnulf of Carinthia granted land to the Archbishop of Salzburg in the \\"Cilarestal\\". Ownership of the valley was divided along the river Ziller. Even today this division is visible, as churches on the right bank of the river generally have green towers and belong to Salzburg Diocese, while churches on the left bank have red towers and belong to Innsbruck Diocese. In 1248, the land west of the Ziller was acquired by the Counts of Tyrol, while the lands east of the Ziller pledged as security to the Counts of Tyrol by the Lords of Rattenberg from 1290 to 1380. In 1504, with both the County of Tyrol and the Archbishopric of Salzburg dominated by the Habsburgs, the Ziller Valley was united under Emperor Maximilian and put under joint Tyrolean/Salzburgian rule. In 1805, the Treaty of Pressburg ended the War of the Third Coalition and forced Austria to cede Tyrol to Bavaria. For the purposes of this treaty, the Ziller Valley was considered part of Salzburg and thus remained with Austria. The people of the Ziller Valley nevertheless joined Andreas Hofer's Tyrolean Rebellion of 1809 in the Battle of the Ziller Bridge (14 May). Later that year, the insurrection was defeated and the Ziller Valley briefly became Bavarian until the Congress of Vienna in 1814/1815. c. 1898 While the relatively lenient stance of the archbishops of Salzburg had allowed the creation of small pockets of Protestantism in their lands since the Protestant Reformation, the remaining Protestants were oppressed more harshly during the Habsburg rule of the 19th century. In 1837, 437 Protestant inhabitants of the Ziller Valley left the valley after they were given the choice of renouncing the Augsburg Confession or emigrating to Silesia, where Frederick William III of Prussia offered them lands and housing near Erdmannsdorf (now Mys≈Çakowice in western Poland). In 1902, the Ziller Valley Railway was constructed, which still runs between Jenbach and Mayrhofen to this day, opening up the valley, the economy of which had previously relied mostly on agriculture and mining, to commerce and tourism. From 1921 to 1976, magnesium carbonate (and later tungsten) were mined around the Alpine pastures of the Schrofen and Wangl Almen above the Tuxertal A ropeway conveyor of more than 9 km length was used to transport the ore to the Ziller Valley Railway goods station in the valley below. The Ziller Valley was known for its itinerant tradesmen, \\"farm doctors\\" and singing families. In the second half of the 19th century refuge huts were erected and trails established as climbing became a mass sport. The development of the area for tourism began in 1953/1954 with the construction of the Gerlosstein ski region, today the Zillertal Arena, which was soon followed by other lifts and the opening of the Mayrhofner Penkenbahn in 1954. The use of water power took off in the 1970s.  Economy  Ziller Valley Railway In the second half of the 20th century, after the end of mining in the valley, tourism became the area's dominant economic activity. In 2003, tourists stayed a total of 6 million nights in the valley, mostly during winter sports holidays. Following a phase of mergers by building connecting lifts during the 1990s and early 2000s, there are now four big ski areas and three smaller satellite areas in the valley, with a combined total of more than 170 lifts and more than 630 km of downhill slopes. Traditional agriculture ‚Äì mostly cattle, dairy and some sheep farming on the Alm pastures ‚Äì is still widespread and the large sawmill outside the village of F√ºgen is a sign of the lumber industry that also plays a significant role. The periphery of the area is home to a number of factories. Four large reservoirs in the Gr√ºnde supply water to a total of eight hydroelectric power stations, generating slightly more than 1,200 GWh per year.  Culture  The Ziller Valley is particularly renowned for its musical tradition. For instance, several families of travelling singers and organ builders from the valley have been credited with spreading the Christmas carol Silent Night across the world during the 19th and early 20th centuries. More recently, the Sch√ºrzenj√§ger band have had tremendous success in German-speaking countries with their crossover mix of Volksmusik and pop.

In May 2014, a new Bultaco was announced. Origins The origin of the Bultaco motorcycle company dates back to May 1958. Francesc \\"Paco\\" Bult√≥ was a director of the Montesa motorcycle company founded in 1944. After several years of steady growth and road racing success, in 1957 Montesa moved to larger facilities. The move was protracted, disrupting production and was followed by a downturn in the Spanish economy. This slump brought to a head disagreements between Bult√≥ and the other senior director Pere Permanyer. As an economy measure, Permanyer (the majority shareholder) felt that the company should withdraw from racing. Bult√≥, the driving force behind the racing program and responsible for much of the company‚Äôs technical expertise was vehemently opposed. Failing to reach a compromise, Bult√≥ decided to leave Montesa to concentrate on his other business interests. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the majority of Montesa's racing department left shortly afterwards as well. Bultaco is formed The suggestion to form a new company is said to have come a few days later when Sr. Bult√≥ was invited to a meeting by several of the former staff of Montesa's racing department. Keen to return to racing, they persuaded him that their greatest hope lay in forming a new company. Setting up shop in very primitive conditions at an old farm owned by Bult√≥, things developed quickly. On March 24, 1959, Bultaco held a press day and launched its first bike, the road-going 125cc Bultaco Tralla 101, named after a Spanish word for whip. Just two months later Bultaco entered its first Spanish Grand Prix taking seven of the first ten places. The company name and logo \\"Bultaco\\" comes from combining the first four letters of Sr. Bult√≥'s surname with the last three of his nickname \\"Paco\\". The name was a suggestion of one of Bultaco's premier racers, and close friend of Sr. Bult√≥, John Grace from Gibraltar. CEMOTO is an acronym for \\"Compa√±ia Espa√±ola de Motores\\". The other part of the company logo, the \\"Thumbs up\\" symbol, came after Sr. Bult√≥ witnessed British motorcycle racer David Whitworth giving the signal to his pit crew to signify that all was well. Sete Gibernau used to have this on the back of his crash helmet when he raced MotoGP. In 1998, rights to the Bultaco name were purchased by Marc Tessier, who used it to help launch a range of purpose-built trials motorcycles from his company Sherco Moto S.A.R.L. The bikes were initially named Bultaco Shercos. In 2000, the bikes became 'Sherco by Bultaco', and in 2001 the Bultaco name was dropped altogether. The US trademark is now owned by HDW Enterprises, parent company of a parts and repair specialist for vintage Bultacos. As of 2017, Bultaco produces electric motorbikes in Barcelona, Catalonia, also the site of the original 1958 factory. Notable products Metralla MK2, 250 cc Bultaco engine detail Although they made road and road racing motorcycles, the company had its greatest success with models for off- road competition; the Pursang for motocross, the Matador for enduros, the Sherpa T for observed trials competition, and the Astro for short flat-track. Perhaps the most famous Bultaco model is the Sherpa T, a trials bike, which revolutionised the sport in the 1960s. At that time trials was almost exclusively a British sport using big heavy four-stroke machines. Irish trials ace Sammy Miller teamed with Bult√≥ to produce a lightweight two-stroke machine which, overnight, rendered the heavy four-strokes obsolete. Miller won the gruelling Scottish Six Days Trial in 1965, and then repeated the feat with wins in 1967 and 1968. He also claimed the European Trials Championship in 1968 and 1970. This coincided with and, perhaps, stimulated the growth in the popularity of trials in Europe and later the USA, which provided a lucrative market for Bultaco in the years to come. Bultaco dominated the World Trials Championship in the 1970s, winning the title eight times, and winning the Scottish Six Days Trial four times. Bultaco's premier model in the USA, the Pursang, was an excellent handling and powerful 250 cc competition model that was competitive in virtually any type of speed-based off-road competition. The Pursang range was later expanded to 125 cc, 360cc and 370 cc. The Bultaco Astro was a very popular short-track racer in the United States, and was used by many AMA Grand National riders in the US in pursuit of their championships, including Mike Kidd, Terry Poovey, Bubba Rush, and hundreds of other top-class competitors. The Astro had a superb power-band, perfectly suited for short- tracks, and some half-miles as well. Bultaco motorcycles were mainly powered by single-cylinder, air cooled, two-stroke engines, but they also made water cooled powerplants. The rider was required to mix the oil and gasoline manually. Built in Barcelona, Spain, Bultaco motorcycles were exported throughout the world, but their largest market ultimately became the USA, allowing aspiring racers to purchase legitimately competitive motorcycles without modification. The Bultaco engine & transmission were universally interchangeable between models and engine capacities; one could replace the cylinder from a 175 cc engine with a 200 cc, 250 cc, 350 cc or even 360 cc capacity Bultaco cylinder. As Bultaco produced the cylinders, pistons, rings & cylinder heads for all engine capacities, no aftermarket parts were required, as with other brands. Due to industrial unrest and market pressures, Bultaco production closed in 1979. The factory reopened in 1980, but closed again in 1983. A new series of electric Bultacos was announced mid-2014, and it began sales in 2015. Former MotoGP star, Sete Gibernau, is the grandson of the founder of Bultaco, Paco Bult√≥.

Speech ‚Äì as distinct from language ‚Äì is the actual process of making sounds, using such organs and structures as the lungs, vocal cords, mouth, tongue, teeth, etc. Language delay refers to a delay in the development or use of the knowledge of language. Because language and speech are two independent stages, they may be individually delayed. For example, a child may be delayed in speech (i.e., unable to produce intelligible speech sounds), but not delayed in language. In this case, the child would be attempting to produce an age appropriate amount of language, but that language would be difficult or impossible to understand. Conversely, since a child with a language delay typically has not yet had the opportunity to produce speech sounds, it is likely to have a delay in speech as well.  Signs and symptoms  The warning signs of early speech delay are categorized into age-related milestones, beginning at the age of 12 months and continuing through early adolescence. At the age of 12 months, there is cause for concern if the child is not able to do the following: * Using gestures such as waving good-bye and pointing at objects * Practicing the use of several different consonant sounds * Vocalizing or communicating needs Between the ages of 15 and 18 months children are at a higher risk for speech delay if they are displaying the following: * Not saying \\"momma\\" and \\"dada\\" * Not reciprocating when told \\"no\\", \\"hello\\", and \\"bye\\" * Does not have a one to three word vocabulary at 12 months and up to 15 words by 18 months * Is unable to identify body parts * Displaying difficulties imitating sounds and actions * Shows preference to gestures over verbalization Additional signs of speech delay after the age of 2 years and up to the age of 4 include the following: * Inability to spontaneously produce words and phrases * Inability to follow simple directions and commands * Cannot make two word connections * Lacks consonant sounds at the beginning or end of words * Is difficult to understand by close family members * Is not able to display the tasks of common household objects * Is unable to form simple 2 to 3 word sentences  Effects  Studies show that children diagnosed with speech delay are more likely to present with behavioral and social emotional problems both in childhood and as adults. Decreased receptive language, reading, and learning skills are common side effects for children that suffer from a speech delay and do not receive adequate intervention. Similar studies suggest that children with speech delays are more likely to have a difficult time communicating and bonding with peers, which could have negative effects on their psychosocial health later in life.  Causes  At times, speech delay and impairment is caused by a physical disruption in the mouth such as a deformed frenulum, lips, or palate. If the motion or ability to form words and appropriate sounds is disrupted, the child may be slow to pick up words and lack the ability to shape their mouth and tongue in the formation of words. Other more serious concerns are those that can be caused by oral-motor issues. Oral-motor dysfunction refers to a lack or delay in the area of the brain that speech is formed and created and communicated to the mouth and tongue. While speech may be the only concern, this disorder can be highlighted with feeding issues as well. Children that are having speech delay disorders could have the following characteristics (Shriberg 1982): * Speech mechanism in which speech is associated with hearing, motor speech and craniofacial malfunction * Cognitive-linguistic aspects in which the impairment is associated with the child's intellectual, receptive, expressive and linguistic ability. * Psychosocial issues in which the impairment is associated with caregiver, school environment, and the child's self behaviors such as aggression and maturity The many other causes of speech delay include bilingual children with phonological disorders, autism spectrum conditions, childhood apraxia, auditory processing disorder, prematurity, cognitive impairment and hearing loss. In addition, when children are addicted to screens, they aren‚Äôt stimulated to be involved in conversations, causing speech delays. Broomfield and Dodd's (2004a) found out after survey that 6.4% of children who are perfectly normal showed speech difficulty while they lacked these disorders will often show early signs and are at times identified as \\"at risk\\" when the speech delay is diagnosed.  Therapies and treatments  After the initial diagnosis of speech delay, a hearing test will be administered to ensure that hearing loss or deafness is not an underlying cause of the delay. If a child has successfully completed the hearing test, the therapy or therapies used will be determined. There are many therapies available for children that have been diagnosed with a speech delay, and for every child, the treatment and therapies needed vary with the degree, severity, and cause of the delay. While speech therapy is the most common form of intervention, many children may benefit from additional help from occupational and physical therapies as well. Physical and occupational therapies can be used for a child that is suffering from speech delay due to physical malformations and children that have also been diagnosed with a developmental delay such as autism or a language processing delay. Music therapy has effective results in the fundamentals of speech development, including phonological memory, sentence understanding, sentence memory, and morphological rule generation. Children that have been identified with hearing loss can be taught simple sign language to build and improve their vocabulary in addition to attending speech therapy. The parents of a delayed child are the first and most important tool in helping overcome the speech delay. The parent or caregiver of the child can provide the following activities at home, in addition to the techniques suggested by a speech therapist, to positively influence the growth of speech and vocabulary: * Reading to the child regularly * Use of questions and simple, clear language * Positive reinforcement in addition to patience For children that are suffering from physical disorder that is causing difficulty forming and pronouncing words, parents and caregivers suggest using and introducing different food textures to exercise and build jaw muscles while promoting new movements of the jaw while chewing. Another less studied technique used to combat and treat speech delay is a form of therapy using music to promote and facilitate speech and language development. It is important to understand that music therapy is in its infancy and has yet to be thoroughly studied and practiced on children suffering from speech delays and impediments.

The suburb borders Crumlin to the east, Drimnagh to the north, Greenhills to the south and Ballymount, Bluebell and Clondalkin to the west. Its postal code is Dublin 12. Walkinstown is a suburb consisting primarily of privately owned residential housing with some social housing remaining in the Dublin City Council area between the Walkinstown and Long Mile Roads and Ballymount Lower. It was built as an estate of starter homes after World War 2 with the council housing being developed as social rented homes later in the early to mid fifties. Light industry, warehousing, car dealerships and commercial outlet stores are concentrated along the Long Mile Road in the western sector of the suburb. The Central Statistics Office census of 2016 recorded a populated of 6819https://www.citypopulation.de/php/ireland-dublin.php From Census 2016 - includes population of electoral divisions: Walkinstown A, B & C for the area. The area is very well served with a library, residents' association, sports ground, community centre, schools, pubs, church and retail facilities. Name and History The name of the area is a corruption of Wilkinstown - named after Wilkins, a tenant farmer who lived in the area in the 15th century. The Irish name for the area is 'Baile Bhailc√≠n'. Walkinstown as a suburb is a 20th-century creation. The area was a dairy farm until house building began in the 1930s. Building ended in the area in the 1970s when most of the available land was built upon. The 1950s saw the building of the local Catholic church as well as primary and second schools for boys and girl. Location and extent There is some ambiguity as to the full extent of the suburb, with some claiming Walkinstown includes Greenhills, as well as one of three parts of Ballymount. Greenhills was previously linked to Walkinstown in the Catholic Church structure to make up the Parish of Walkinstown and Greenhills, at a time when Greenhills did not have its own local church. This combined parish ceased to exist when Greenhills acquired its own parish church in 1971. Greenhills is generally regarded now as a separate and distinct suburb, with its own identity and full range of services. The distinction between Ballymount and Walkinstown is not so well defined. Given that Ballymount has a less clear identity, many consider it to form part of Walkinstown. The area itself is primarily given over to light industry with much less residential housing than its nearest neighbour, Walkinstown. Most residential housing which exists directly borders on the Ballymount Road which itself is often listed as Walkinstown. Residents of Ballymount do not have their own services and so rely on Walkinstown for schools, church and commercial centres. Amenities There is a branch of Dublin City Public Libraries and Archive - the Walkinstown Public Library - on Percy French Road. The local An Post post office is in SuperValu on the Walkinstown Road. The local branch of the Irish League of Credit Unions, Walkinstown Credit Union, is located on Walkinstown Green. The local Catholic Church, Our Lady of the Assumption, is one of the largest buildings in the suburb and is situated on Kilnamanagh Road, near the Long Mile Road. It forms part of a major concentration of religious and educational services, with a girls school (Our Lady of the Assumption) adjacent to the Church, whilst a boys school, Drimnagh Castle CBS, is situated opposite the girls school on the other side of the Long Mile Road. Both these schools provide primary and secondary education. Walkinstown Park is a Dublin City Council run park, on the Walkinstown Avenue opposite Lidl. The park has three football pitches and two GAA pitches. It also has a tennis court and a stream that runs at the rear of the park. The premises of the Walkinstown Association, which provides services to people with intellectual disabilities, is situated on the Long Mile Road, adjacent to the Halfway House public house. The 94th Dublin Scout Den is situated on Bunting Road. Walkinstown is served by six pubs, located in two hubs. The first hub is located at the intersection of the Drimnagh, Walkinstown and Long Mile roads, while the second is situated at the Walkinstown Roundabout. The six pubs are the Halfway House, the Long Mile Inn, The Black Forge, The Eleanora, the Cherrytree and the Kestrel House. Previously, Walkinstow was referred to as being served by six \\"and a half\\" pubs. The \\"half a pub\\" refers to The Submarine Bar, which although almost entirely located in Crumlin had its main entrance on Cromwellsfort Road in Walkinstown. There is no local Garda station. The area is served equally by neighbouring Crumlin's two Garda stations - the Crumlin Village and Sundrive Road stations. The three hospitals which primarily serve the local community are Tallaght Hospital, Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin and St. James' Hospital. Shopping There is a large SuperValu on the Walkinstown Road. The Ashleaf Shopping Centre, located on Cromwellsfort Road, is the nearest shopping centre and has as anchor tenant Dunnes Stores, providing both supermarket and clothing retail services. Lidl is located on Walkinstown Avenue opposite Walkinstown Park. Aldi is located on the Long Mile Road. Small commercial enterprises such as newsagents, pharmacies and fast food outlets as well as local branches of the major banks are concentrated in a similar fashion to the area's pubs, at the intersection of the Drimnagh, Walkinstown and Long Mile roads as well as around the Walkinstown Roundabout. There is also a Subway, Eddie Rockets and a Polish food store located at the rear of LIDL on Walkinstown Avenue. Walkinstown Roundabout is one of the busiest in the city. Its construction was held up for many years due to protracted negotiations to purchase a small white washed cottage on the then Walkinstown Cross (scene of many bad motor crashes). The resident was eventually rehoused in a new bungalow at the top of Walkinstown Avenue. This cottage was formerly in the centre of the new roundabout. Local landmarks There are a few local historic landmarks within the area of Walkinstown. One of the oldest buildings in the immediate vicinity is Drimnagh Castle, located on the northern side of the Long Mile Road. This castle dates from 1216 and is the only castle in Ireland with a flooded moat. The Halfway House pub is the oldest public house in the area, predating all of the housing developments that went to make up the suburb.Historic Map of Area showing Halfway House This pub, which used to be a Coachhouse, situated halfway between Dublin and Tallaght, retains the outward appearance of the country pub, although the interior was recently modernised. The most distinctive buildings of the Walkinstown area are that of the local Catholic church and schools, built in a sturdy style of the 1950s with red brick and green copper roofing and impressive stained glass windows, made by local craftsmen. The layout of the suburb is such that \\"nests\\" of smaller roads run off the main roads, usually with green open spaces as focal points. The dominant style of the area is that of a mid-20th century Dublin housing development. One of the key features of the area is the Walkinstown Roundabout, also known as Walkinstown Cross, one of the largest, and most accident-prone roundabouts in the Dublin area. This major junction serves seven major local roads - Walkinstown Road towards Drimnagh, Bunting Road towards Crumlin, Cromwellsfort Road towards Kimmage and Crumlin, and St Peter's Road towards Greenhills and Templeogue, Greenhills Road towards Tallaght, Ballymount Road towards Ballymount and the M50 and Walkinstown Avenue towards Ballyfermot, An area of Walkinstown north of Cromwellsfort Road is known as the Musical Roads. Roads in this area are named after prominent figures of Irish music - examples include the tenor Count John McCormack and composers Michael William Balfe, Percy French and Edward Bunting. The SuperValu supermarket on Walkinstown Road was once the site of Walkinstown House, a distinctive country house and the family home of the Flanagan family, including the infamous \\"The Bird Flanagan\\", a well-known Dublin character and infamous practical joker of the early 20th century. It is said that The Long Mile Road was named after a mile long horse race along this route won by the Bird Flanagan. However it was later argued that it was a long mile.Walkinstown House, Walkinstown, Co.Dublin Administration Walkinstown is in the extreme south-west of the Dublin City Council area and in local government elections is part of the Ballyfermot-Drimnagh Ward. Since the last local elections in 2014, the local elected representatives on Dublin City Council are: * Paul Hand (Independent) * Daith√≠ Doolan (Sinn F√©in) * Vincent Jackson (Independent) * Greg Kelly (Sinn F√©in) * Br√≠d Smith (People Before Profit) * Daith√≠ de R√≥iste (Fianna F√°il) Walkinstown is part of the Dublin South-Central D√°il constituency.

That club has since morphed, changed name and amalgamated with others to form the current St James' Gaels GAA club which is still charged with the promotion of Gaelic Games in the Walkinstown area. Walkinstown Athletic FC is the local soccer team. W.S.A.F. - Walkinstown Sports and Athletic Association - meet at Moeran Community Hall on Summerville Drive. Mooney's Field, the local name given to the largest green open space in the Walkinstown area (situated on Bunting Road), is used for many field sports. The nearest municipal swimming pool is located in Crumlin village. Walkinstown United Football Club is the leading football team based in Walkinstown, Dublin 12. The home ground is Walkinstown Park, which is located in the heart of Walkinstown. Established in 1978, the club has had much success with honours such as league promotion and league cup wins. Transportation Walkinstown is well served by Dublin Bus both in terms of number of routes and frequency. Route numbers 18, 27, 77A, 56A, 123 and 151 all pass by, or very near to, the Halfway House pub. The 9, 17 & 150 pass the Ashleaf Shopping Centre/Submarine Bar while the 122 has its terminus at Our Lady's Hospital (Crumlin), approximately 5 minutes walk east of the Halfway House pub. Typical bus journey time to the city centre is 25 minutes, and a little longer than this during peak periods. The Dublin Bus Nitelink 77N service provides a one-way link from Dublin city centre to Walkinstown until late at night after regular bus services finish at 23:30. This route departs from a bus stop on College Green opposite Doyle's pub in the city centre. Although the Luas does not serve Walkinstown, the route of the Red Line takes it to within walking distance of the suburb. The nearest stops are Bluebell and Kylemore, approximately 10 minutes north of the intersection of the Walkinstown and Drimnagh roads. There used to be a DHL Express depot in Walkinstown, which closed in 2008 and since 2018 is now the primary depot for Go-Ahead Ireland.

In the US state of Michigan, it was a north‚Äìsouth state trunkline highway that entered the state south of Kinderhook and ended south of Grayling. Its route consisted of a freeway concurrency with Interstate 69 (I-69) from the state line north to the Lansing area before it followed its own freeway facility northward to St. Johns. From there north to Ithaca, US 27 was an expressway before continuing as a freeway to a terminus south of Grayling. Created with the rest of the US Highway System on November 11, 1926, US 27 replaced a pair of state highways between the state line and the Cheboygan area. For a time, US 27 even extended from Cheboygan to St. Ignace over the Mackinac Bridge. The highway was converted into a series of freeways starting in the late 1950s. The northernmost section between Grayling and Mackinaw City, bypassing Cheboygan, became part of I-75, and US 27 was truncated to Grayling. Starting in the 1960s, the southern sections were included in I-69. The last section of Interstate in Michigan was completed in 1992 when I-69/US 27 opened southwest of Lansing. In the 1990s, a bypass of St. Johns north of Lansing was built, the last freeway segment of US 27 to open under that designation. On April 16, 1999, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) approved the removal of the US 27 designation from the state of Michigan; this change was put into place when the highway number was removed from signage in 2002. Former segments of US 27 from its pre-freeway configuration are still state highways in the form of M-27 between Indian River and Cheboygan or the various business routes in the state that previously bore Business US 27 (Bus. US 27) designations. Route description=Southern Michigan= I-69/US 27 in Michigan began at the Indiana state line southeast of Kinderhook, just north of an interchange with the Indiana Toll Road (I-80/I-90). From there, I-69/US 27 ran northward through a mixture of Southern Michigan farmland and woodland in Branch County. A few miles north of the state line, the freeway passes Coldwater Lake State Park and its namesake body of water; north of the lake, there is a welcome center for the northbound lanes. I-69/US 27 curved around the east side of Coldwater, connecting to the city's business loop on the south of town. The freeway intersects the northern end of the business loop immediately east of downtown at an interchange that also features US 12 (Chicago Road). A third interchange, some further north, features a distribution center for Walmart stores in the region. Further north, the freeway curves around to the northwest into Calhoun County and crosses over the St. Joseph River. I-69/US 27 turned back northward and bypassed Tekonsha to the town's west, intersecting M-60 in the process. Curving around Nottawa Lake, I-69/US 27 continued northward through southern Calhoun County. It passed through an interchange that marked the southern terminus of M-227, a highway that runs northward into Marshall. The freeway crosses the Kalamazoo River and through an interchange with M-96 west of downtown Marshall. From that interchange northward, the BL I-94 designation was overlaid on I-69/US 27; the business loop ends at the cloverleaf interchange with I-94 northwest of Marshall. North of I-94, I-69/US 27 had one more interchange before crossing into Eaton County. Aerial view looking north from the I-496 interchange along I-96/I-69/US 27 west of Lansing In southern Eaton County, the freeway parallels the Battle Creek River north of the junction with M-78. Near Olivet, I-69/US 27 began to turn in a northeasterly direction. As it continued in that direction, it ran to the north side of Olivet. On the south side of Charlotte, I-69/US 27 turned northward, traversing an area to the east of downtown and crossing the former routing of US 27, which is now part of the business loop for the city. Further north, the freeway has a junction with M-50, a bridge over the Battle Creek River, and an interchange with the northern end of the business loop next to Fitch H. Beach Airport. North of the airport, I-69/US 27 turned northeasterly again and paralleled Lansing Road, the former route of US 27/M-78. The freeway meets the southern end of M-100 near Potterville and continues onto the Lansing‚ÄìEast Lansing metropolitan area. Southwest of the state's capital city, I-69/US 27 crossed over Lansing Road near Lansing Delta Township Assembly, a factory for General Motors; northeast of the complex, I-69/US 27 merged into I-96. The combined I-96/I-69/US 27 ran northward through the suburban edges of the Lansing area, intersecting the western ends of I-496 and the BL I-69 for Lansing. The freeway enters Clinton County, and just north of a crossing of the Grand River, I-69/US 27 turned eastward to separate from I-96. As a part of the larger interchange with I-96, I-69/US 27 crossed BL I-96 (Grand River Avenue) without any connections. =Mid-Michigan to Grayling= After leaving the I-96 concurrency, I-69 changes cardinal orientation and is signed as east‚Äìwest from that point on. The freeway continues parallel to the Looking Glass River through suburban areas north of Capital Region International Airport. North of East Lansing, I-69/US 27 met US 127 at a cloverleaf interchange, and US 27 turned northward to separate from I-69. The US 27 freeway ran through farmland and crossed the Looking Glass River. At Price Road, US 27 met its southernmost business loop, the Bus. US 27 for St. Johns. The freeway continues due north and intersects M-21 east of town before it turns northwesterly to round the northern side of St. Johns. North of downtown, US 27 met the northern end of the business loop and the freeway ends. Continuing northward as an expressway, the highway has four lanes divided by a median with at-grade intersections at the cross roads. In Gratiot County, US 27 was named Bagley Road. North of Wilson Road, the expressway crosses the Maple River on a causeway through a wetland area in the Maple River State Game Area. North of the river, the expressway crosses a branch line of the Great Lakes Central Railroad, then has an interchange with M-57. About further north, US 27 turned to the northwest, separating from Bagley Road. The expressway transitions back to a full freeway as the trunkline turns north and curves around the east side of Ithaca, meeting the southern end of Ithaca's business loop at Center Road, and the opposite end north of town. Further north, US 27 angled northwesterly between Alma and St. Louis. Each city has its own business loop, accessible on the south side through a pair of partial interchanges at Lincoln and State roads. The freeway crosses the Pine River before intersecting M-46 and the two business loops at another pair of interchanges north of downtown Alma. After US 27 crossed into Isabella County, it turned northwesterly near Shepherd. After a few miles, a short freeway spur carrying the Bus. US 27 for Mount Pleasant splits off and the main freeway turns back to the north. The two highways continue in parallel through town before turning to converge north of Mount Pleasant by the airport. After the freeway stub at the northern end of the business loop merges in, the main freeway crosses the Chippewa River. US 27 continued through northern Isabella County to pass east of Rosebush. South of the Clare County line in Clare, US 27 met the southern end of Clare's Bus. US 27\\\\. The freeway turns northeasterly, crosses Bus. US 10 and the county line before merging with US 10\\\\. US 27/US 10 curved around Lake Shamrock on the northern end of town before meeting the northern end of Bus. US 27/Bus. US 10\\\\. The freeway continues north, past a welcome center in the median, and US 10 splits off to the west. North of Clare, US 27 ran through forest, where it passed to the east of Harrison. On the east side of that town, the freeway crosses between Little Long and Sutherland lakes before meeting the northern end of the Harrison business loop. The freeway then crosses into Roscommon County. East of the community of Houghton Lake Heights and the city of Houghton Lake, US 27 intersected M-55. North of that interchange, the freeway parallels the western shore of Houghton Lake and crosses the Muskegon River. The freeway then turns a bit northeasterly toward Higgins Lake and follows that lake's western shore before crossing into Crawford County. Once across the county line, US 27 curved around to the northeast for about before terminating at I-75 south of Grayling. History=Predecessor highways= Map of the pre-statehood Indian trails The first major overland transportation corridors in the future state of Michigan were the Indian trails. Only one of these followed part of the path of US 27; the Mackinac Trail roughy paralleled the route of US 27 from Grayling north. The State Trunkline Highway System was created on May 13, 1913, by an act of the Michigan Legislature; at the time, no one of the system's divisions corresponded to US 27\\\\. Division 3 followed a course from Lansing northward to an intersection with Division 2\\\\. Combined with the northernmost sections of Division 2 to the Straits of Mackinac, these highways roughly described the future route of US 27. In 1919, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) signposted the highway system for the first time, and two different highways followed sections of the future US 27 corridor. The original M-29 ran from the Indiana state line north to Lansing. The second highway was M-14 from Lansing north to Cheboygan. =United States Numbered Highways era= The US 27 marker originally used in Michigan On November 11, 1926, the United States Numbered Highway System was approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO), and the new US 27 replaced M-29 from the state line northward to Lansing; from Lansing northward, US 27 replaced M-14 to Cheboygan. By the end of the next year, M-78 was extended from Charlotte along US 27 to run north and east of Lansing to a junction with M-47 near Pittsburg. In 1929, the route of US 27/M-18 was realigned south of Roscommon on the east side of Higgins Lake. The same year, another realignment moved US 27 to run due north from the Clinton‚ÄìGratiot county line to M-43 at Ithaca, and a third change rounded a corner near Shepherd in Isabella County. When a new roadway was built in the St. Louis area in 1930, the former routing into Alma was redesignated US 27A; another US 27A was created in Shepherd around the same time. By the middle of 1936, the US 27/M-78 routing through Lansing was split into two. The mainline was restricted to cars only and moved to run along Capitol Avenue. The former routing was restricted to trucks only and designated as a truck route. By the end of the year, another realignment straightened out a series of turns from the county line northward to Wolverine in Cheboygan County. The following year, US 27 was extended to follow US 23 between Cheboygan and Mackinaw City. That year, the last section of the highway was also paved southwest of Houghton Lake. In 1938, the route of US 27 on the north side of downtown Lansing was realigned on an extended Larch Street. The US 27A loop into Shepherd was removed the next year. In the latter half of 1940, US 23 was rerouted to follow the Lake Huron shoreline northwest of Alpena; after this change was completed, US 27's concurrency with US 23 was shortened to start in downtown Cheboygan instead of south of town. Later in the decade, US 27 was rerouted to run to the west of Houghton and Higgins lakes in 1949. The next year, the truck route designation in Lansing was decommissioned when the mainline was rerouted to replace it. In the early 1950s, the highway was rerouted to the south of St. Johns, and by early 1952 a business loop was created for the city; this four-lane divided highway extended as far south as the DeWitt area. By the end of 1952, a four-lane divided highway segment opened southwest of Lansing to bypass Millett. =Conversion to freeways= US 27 before relocation and conversion to a freeway near Clare The first planning maps from 1947 for what later became the Interstate Highway System did not include a highway along US 27's route; instead a highway further west connecting South Bend, Indiana, with Kalamazoo was included. This alternative highway was maintained on the 1955 plan for the \\"National System of Interstate and Defense Highways\\", and numbered I-67 in August 1957. By June 1958, this freeway had been shifted further east and renumbered I-69, connecting Indianapolis, Indiana, with Marshall; no connections north and east to Lansing were planned as part of the Interstate Highway System. The Mackinac Bridge was opened to traffic on November 1, 1957; a new section of freeway and an interchange connected US 2 to the bridge on the northern end, and a new approach road connected to U.S. Route 31 in Michigan and US 27 in Mackinaw City on the southern end. The US 27 designation was initially extended across the bridge from Mackinaw City to St. Ignace. In November 1960, sections of I-75 freeway opened from Indian River north to the southern Mackinac Bridge approaches in Mackinaw City, and US 27 was removed from the bridge. In 1961, the MSHD had proposed that the section of US 27 south of Lansing be built as an electronic highway under a bid through General Motors; the testing for such a roadway was ultimately done at Ohio State University instead. That October, the first segment of I-75 near Grayling opened, connecting M-18 with the city. By the end of the year, the former segment of US 27 between Grayling and Gaylord was turned back to local control, and the section of highway between Indian River and Cheboygan was redesignated M-27. After this individual segment of freeway was completed, there was a gap between Gaylord and Indian River that was designated \\"TO I-75\\" on maps along the former segment of US 27, and US 27 was truncated to about south of Grayling. Also by the end of the same year, the highway was shifted to follow a new freeway routing from the southwest of Ithaca to Grayling, bypassing Ithaca, St. Louis, Mount Pleasant, Clare and Harrison. The old route was turned over to local control except through the aforementioned cities where it was reused for business loops. The US 27A through Alma was also bypassed by the new freeway, and it was redesignated Bus. US 27 as well. Another non-freeway bypass was built around Charlotte, and the former route was redesignated Bus. US 27. In August 1962, the section of I-75 between Gaylord and Vanderbilt was completed. On December 12, 1962, I-96 was completed around the Lansing area, and M-78 was rerouted to follow it. The route of US 27/M-78 through downtown Lansing became US 27/Bus. M-78. On October 11, 1967, the first segment of I-69/US 27 was scheduled to open between the Indiana state line and Tekonsha. By the end of the year, the freeway was extended north to Marshall. The former route of US 27 in Coldwater was redesignated as a Business Loop I-69 (BL I-69) as well. The MSHD requested additional Interstate Highway mileage in 1968 under the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968 including an extension of I-69 from Marshall to Port Huron; this extension was approved as far as I-75/US 23 in Flint on December 13, 1968. This extension encompassed the US 27 corridor between Marshall and Lansing. In 1970, the I-69/US 27 freeway was extended from Marshall to just south of Olivet. The next year, the freeway was extended north to, and incorporated, the previous Charlotte bypass. Bus. US 27 through Charlotte remains unchanged. In 1973, the M-78 concurrency from Olivet northeasterly along US 27 was removed, and the connection along US 27 northeast of the existing I-69 freeway was designated TEMP I-69. The following year, Bus. US 27 in Charlotte was renumbered as a BL I-69. In the middle of 1974, Indiana and Michigan petitioned AASHTO to decommission the US 27 designation north of Fort Wayne, Indiana, including the entire length in Michigan; this request was denied. A northern freeway bypass of the Lansing area opened in 1984. MDOT rerouted US 27 to follow I-96 around the west side of the city and over the new freeway to reconnect with the exiting routing north of Lansing. The former US 27 through downtown Lansing was redesignated Bus. US 27 at that time. Three years later in January 1987, MDOT dropped a proposal to reroute US 27 south of Lansing to the Jackson area, and from there west along M-60 to reconnect with I-69/US 27 at Tekonsha. Another segment of freeway opened later that year in Clinton County between US 127 near DeWitt and TEMP I-69 near Bath. In 1991, MDOT and the Indiana Department of Transportation petitioned AASHTO to remove the US 27 designation from its concurrency with I-69 in the two states; this request was denied by the association's Special Committee on U.S. Route Numbering at its October 11, 1991, meeting because it would have resulted in a section of US 27 north of Lansing disconnected from the remainder of the highway south of Fort Wayne. The final segment of I-69/US 27 to be completed was located southwest of Lansing. It opened on October 17, 1992, when the ribbon was cut by Governor John Engler. This Interstate Highway segment was the last in the state and completed Michigan's portion of the Interstate Highway System. At the time it was complete, I-69 was concurrent with US 27 from the state line north to the DeWitt area (exit 87) and then concurrent with US 127 to exit 89. A few years later, the statutory definition of the I-73 corridor was amended in 1995 to have a branch that would encompass the section of US 27 north of Lansing. This new Interstate was to follow US 223 and US 127 between Toledo, Ohio, and Lansing before continuing north to I-75 near Grayling. From Grayling northward, the I-73 corridor was defined to follow I-75 to Sault Ste. Marie. The St. Johns Bypass on US 27 opened on August 31, 1998; US 27 was extended along I-69 about to connect to the bypass, and US 127 was removed from its short concurrency with I-69. After this opening, US 27 was a full freeway in Michigan from the state line north to St. Johns and from Ithaca to the Grayling area. The last signalized intersection on US 27 in the state was removed in 2000 when the junction with M-57 was converted to an interchange in southern Gratiot County. =Decommissioning in Michigan= left The previous year, MDOT petitioned AASHTO to decommission the US 27 designation in the state; the change was approved by AASHTO on April 16, 1999. The department considered three options to build the southern segments of I-73 in 2000; MDOT abandoned further study of these southern alignments after June 12, 2001, diverting remaining funding to safety improvement projects along the corridor. The department stated there was a \\"lack of need\\" for sections of the proposed freeway, and the project website was closed down in 2002. The approved removal of US 27 was finally done in the middle of 2002. MDOT's stated reason for the modification was to \\"reduce confusion along the US 27/US 127 corridor\\". After US 27's signage was removed, the highway north of the Lansing area was renumbered US 127, and the US 27 designation was removed from I-69. All of the business loops were updated to reflect their new parent highway. On August 19, 2010, the Michigan House of Representatives passed a resolution recognizing \\"Old US 27\\" as a historic road in the state. According to press reports in 2011, a group advocating on behalf of I-73 is working to revive the freeway project in Michigan. According to an MDOT spokesman, \\"to my knowledge, we‚Äôre not taking that issue up again.\\" Exit list At the time the US 27 designation was decommissioned in Michigan, only the interchanges along the section concurrent with I-69 used exit numbers. Related trunklines Over its history, US 27 had several business loops associated with it. Since the conversion of the highway into a freeway starting in the 1950s, these business loops served Marshall, Charlotte, Lansing, St. Johns, Ithaca, Alma, St. Louis, Mount Pleasant, Clare and Harrison. The business loops north of Lansing were redesignated as business loops of US 127 in 2002 while the Charlotte loop had been reassigned BL I-69 with the completion of I-69 through the area. In addition, Michigan had a US 27A designation through Alma and a Truck US 27 in Lansing. =Marshall business route= Business US Highway 27 (Bus.. US 27) was a business route running through downtown Marshall. The designation ran concurrently with BL I-94 from I-69/US 27 on Michigan Avenue easterly from that freeway into downtown. At the intersection with Kalamazoo Avenue, Bus. US 27 turned northward, separating from BL I-94. The business route ended north of downtown at an interchange with I-94 after running for about . In 1967, the first segment of I-69 opened in Michigan, bypassing Marshall to the east. The state shifted US 27 out of downtown Marshall to follow the new freeway. From the temporary end of I-69 at I-94, US 27 followed I-94 back to its existing routing north of Marshall. The former route of US 27 through downtown Marshall was then redesignated Bus. US 27, using BL I-94 to connect to the new freeway carrying US 27 west of downtown. This arrangement lasted until 1972 when the Bus. US 27 designation was decommissioned and the section of highway between BL I-94 and I-94 turned over to local control. Major intersections =Truck route= Truck US 27 was a former truck route through the city of Lansing. It started at the corner of Capitol Avenue and Main Street and ran along Main Street to Grand Avenue. There, it turned north on Grand Avenue to Kalamazoo Street and turned east on Kalamazoo over the Grand River. At Larch Street, Truck US 27 continued north to rejoin the mainline at the corner of Larch and Saginaw streets. By the middle of 1936, the US 27/M-78 routing through Lansing was split into two. The mainline was restricted to cars only and moved to run along Capitol Avenue. The former routing was restricted to trucks only and designated as a truck route. In 1950, the bridge for Main Street over the Grand River was completed and mainline US 27/M-78 was rerouted to use it to connect to Larch Street. From there north, US 27/M-78 followed Larch Street supplanting the truck route, which was decommissioned at that time.

Life He was born at Mont√©limar. He was educated at the Jesuit's College at Lyon and afterwards at Grenoble where he studied law and was admitted as an advocate to the parlement. He rose to be president of the seneschal's court in Mont√©limar (1765), where he acquitted himself with distinction. However, he became disenchanted with law and wished to pursue his love of nature that had begun earlier in his life. His favourite pastime was visiting the mountain regions in the Alps and Massif Central. There he began to study the forms, structure, composition and superposition of rocks. In 1775 in the Velay he discovered a rich deposit of pozzuolana, that was eventually mined by the government. In 1776 he established a relationship with Buffon, who recognised the value of his scientific efforts immediately. Invited by Buffon to Paris, Faujas ceased his legal work and was appointed assistant naturalist to the natural history museum by Louis XVI. Later, he was appointed royal commissioner for mines. Fingal's Cave ca. 1900 One of his most important works was Recherches sur les volcans √©teints du Vivarais et du Velay, which appeared in 1778. This publication documented his astute observations allowing Faujas to develop a theory about the origin of volcanoes. In his capacity of commissioner for mines Faujas travelled to most European countries where he closely observed the natural environment and the rock formations. In Britain he met William and Caroline Herschel. He however was determined to visit Staffa and he set out with the American polymath William Thornton and the Italian balloonist Count Andreani. Faujas was the first to recognize the volcanic nature of the basaltic columns of Fingal's Cave, on Staffa. The island was visited earlier in 1772 by Sir Joseph Banks, who remarked that the stone was a coarse kind of basalt, very much resembling the Giant's Causeway in Ireland as noted in (Pennant's Tour in Scotland and Voyage to the Hebrides). Faujas' Voyage en Angleterre, en √âcosse et aux √éles H√©brides (1797) contains anecdotes about Sir Joseph Banks, William and Caroline Herschel and Dr. John Whitehurst, including an amusing account of The Dinner of an Academic Club (the Royal Society). It was shortly translated into English (2 vols., 1799). In 1785, Faujas was named king's commissioner to factories, armories, and royal forests. This brought a salary of 4,000 livres, and 2,000 livres for travelling expenses, in addition to his 6,000 livres for the assistant naturalist post. Faujas was appointed the first professor of geology at the Jardin des Plantes in 1793, a post he held until he was nearly eighty years of age. In 1794 he secured the skull of Mosasaurus, when Maastricht was captured, and moved it to Paris. He retired in 1818 to the estate of Saint-Fond in Dauphin√©. Faujas had a keen interest in the balloon experiments of the Montgolfier brothers, and published the very complete 2 volume work, Description des exp√©riences de la machine a√©rostatique de MM. Montgolfier, &c.; (1783, 1784). He also contributed many scientific memoirs to the Annales and the M√©moires of the museum of natural history. Among his other works are: Histoire naturelle de la province de Dauphin√© (1787, 1782), Min√©ralogie des volcans (1784), and Essai de g√©ologie (1803‚Äì1809).

History Iowa State University‚Äôs original telescope and observatory, located northwest of Ames, was donated by the family of Milo Mather of Clarksville, Iowa, following his death in 1960. Mather was an accomplished amateur astronomer and mechanical engineering graduate (1907) of Iowa State. In 1970, the mirror from his telescope was reconditioned and used in a newly reconfigured telescope, also named after Mather, and installed in the Erwin W. Fick Observatory. Iowa State built the Fick Observatory southwest of Boone, Iowa, in 1970. The facility was named after Erwin W. Fick (1897‚Äì1975), an amateur astronomer and retired member of the U.S. Corps of Engineers from Davenport, Iowa. Though Fick had never been to Ames, let alone graduated from Iowa State, he set up a trust through the ISU Foundation to help support Iowa State‚Äôs observatory. New imaging devices, such as the CCD (charge-coupled device) camera installed in 1990, and the short focal length of the telescope allowed researchers to obtain wide-field views of the sky to very faint limits. Measurements gathered by the Mather telescope could be used to complement data obtained by larger observatories, which often sacrifice wide views for fine detail. Over the years, Iowa State researchers used the Fick Observatory for a wide variety of studies, including stellar radial velocity observations, studies of ring galaxy collisions, and lunar occultation studies.

It was previously the commercial portion of a four block square megastructure-type development, The Hartford Civic Center complex, which also contains a multi-purpose coliseum, an exhibition and trade show center, structured parking and a 330-room Sheraton (now Hilton) hotel. Stores The mall featured approximately fifty small shops and restaurants and was initially anchored by a new specialty department store, Luettgen's Ltd, created and operated by William Luettgen, who was previously the president of local department store chain, G. Fox & Co.. This anchor space was later split. The mall contained a number of unique and national specialty shops such as a Hartford Whalers Team Store, Al Franklin's Musical World, B. Dalton Bookseller, Ann Taylor and Koenig Art Emporium. A third level contained about of office space, overlooking both the mall interior and the adjacent streets. Architecture Architecturally, the mall reflected the brutalist and insular character of many early 1970s megastructure-type projects. The exterior of the L-shaped mall was constructed of prefabricated concrete panels and was surrounded by overscaled concrete landscape planter beds that cut off any facade to the sidewalk. History Built and operated by the Hartford- based insurance company Aetna, and called \\"the bunker\\" by its critics, the mall was, moderately successful in its early years, and was an economic catalyst that for a time stabilized the decline of the downtown retail district in Hartford.James Lomuscio, \\"Hartford Civic Center's Hard Times\\", The New York Times, May 3, 1998. Its construction was also partially credited with kicking off the office building boom that began in the late 1970s and would eventually add nearly five million square feet of new office space in the area over the following decade. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, the mall faced competition from the nearby newly constructed Westfarms (which opened the same year as Civic Center Mall) and The Shops at Buckland Hills malls. Given its limited size, the accelerating decline in the downtown retail district and the severe recession in the regional economy by the early 1990s, many of the mall's tenants left or ceased operations and the mall fell into severe decline. By 1998 the project's viability was in doubt, and Aetna was stating that it had lost more than $56 million on the project since its opening. Redevelopment In 2004 Investment Corporation, the State of Connecticut, the City of Hartford, and Aetna began working to redevelop the former Civic Center Mall complex. The project, called Hartford 21, replaced the aging retail, office and restaurant mall portion of the Hartford Civic Center Coliseum with a new, contemporary-styled residential, retail and entertainment complex.Tom Puleo, \\"36-floor Story: Hartford Getting A \`24-hour Neighborhood'\\", Hartford Courant, June 24, 2004. The portion of original mall at the corner of Trumbull and Asylum Streets, which had originally contained the anchor stores and food court, was demolished and redevelopment starting in 2004 and reaching substantial completion in the summer of 2006. The project included a new 36-story residential tower with 262 luxury apartments, of sidewalk-oriented retail space and of office space,\\"Hartford 21\\" in Boston and Beyond: CBT Architects, (Images Publishing, 2013), , pp. 106ff. Excerpts available at Google Books. at the corner of Trumbull and Asylum Streets. The portion of the mall fronting Asylum Street, was converted into street-level retail on the ground floor, with the upper levels converted into a parking deck for the residential tower. The original below-grade parking garage occupying the basement levels of the mall remains in use for public and coliseum event parking. The portion fronting Trumbull street, including the atrium for the coliseum, remains largely intact, although the facade has been rebuilt in modern theme, providing access to retail spaces from the street. The food court had occupied the basement level of the demolished portion of the mall.

The team is managed by Marc Madiot, a former road bicycle racer and winner of the Paris‚ÄìRoubaix classic in 1985 and 1991. The team is predominantly French. History The team was founded on the initiative of Marc Madiot after he retired from racing in 1994 following a leg-breaking crash in that year's edition of Paris‚ÄìRoubaix. After a period in the mid-1990s when the professional cycling scene in France was contracting - resulting in the 1996 French National Road Race Championships elite race being held on a pro‚Äìam basis due to the reduced number of professional riders - by the time of the team's launch in 1997 they faced competition for riders in France from fellow newcomers as well as the expanding team and the already established outfit. The team's initial lineup included younger French riders such as teenagers Nicolas Vogondy and Damien Nazon as well as more experienced foreign racers like Davide Rebellin, Mauro Gianetti, Max Sciandri and Andrea Peron. The inaugural squad also included the reigning French national champions in road racing, time trialling and cyclo- cross - St√©phane Heulot, Eddy Seigneur and Christophe Mengin respectively. In their first season the team only took a total of 13 wins and won the UCI Road World Cup - however these included several high-profile victories such as Fr√©d√©ric Guesdon's triumph at Paris‚ÄìRoubaix, a stage win for Mengin at the Tour de France and victories for Rebellin at the Cl√°sica de San Sebasti√°n and Z√ºri-Metzgete. In the 2003 edition of Tour de France, Australian individual time trial specialist Bradley McGee won the prologue stage to wear the yellow jersey for a few days. McGee was also able to win the prologue of the following year's Giro d'Italia, wore the pink jersey for three days and finished the race in the top ten (finishing eighth). Sprinter Baden Cooke won the green jersey for the points competition. On 31 October 2012, it emerged that BigMat would no longer sponsor the team, with the team choosing to focus on finding another co-sponsor for the 2014 season. Sponsorship The team has been sponsored by Fran√ßaise des Jeux (lottery) since its founding in 1997. Fran√ßaise des Jeux, the French national lottery, owns a majority of shares in the team, and the team is based in a warehouse owned by Fran√ßaise des Jeux on the outskirts of Paris: according to Madiot the team and the sponsor have a close working relationship. The team was named FDJeux.com in 2003 and 2004, then renamed Fran√ßaise des Jeux, supposedly to avoid bad luck, until July 2010, when the name was simplified to its initials. Prior to the 2012 season, French building merchants BigMat joined the team as co-sponsors, becoming FDJ‚ÄìBigMat, contributing ‚Ç¨2 million to the team. Following the departure of BigMat, the team renamed itself FDJ.fr. At the end of 2017, the team announced that they secured a sponsorship deal with French insurance group Groupama for the 2018 season, becoming Groupama‚ÄìFDJ, contributing investment that increased the team's budget from ‚Ç¨16 million to ‚Ç¨20 million for next season. Doping In February 2019, Austrian newspaper Kronen Zeitung broke news that a number of professional cyclists had been implicated in the doping scandal uncovered at the 2019 FIS Nordic World Ski Championships. Georg Preidler confessed to having his blood extracted for a possible transfusion. On 3 March, Preidler confessed to Austrian police, whilst also terminating his contract with the team via email.

He worked as a general manager of Hyundai Home Shopping, a Hyundai Department Store Group company, until Prince Yi Ku died on 16 July 2005. He was born as the eldest son of Yi Gap, the 9th son of Prince Yi Kang by one of his partners at Hyehwa- dong, Jongno-gu, Seoul; after the death of Yi Ku, Yi Won was appointed to be the adopted heir to the prince, as the 30th head of the Imperial house.  Biography  Yi Won attended the Sangmun High School during 1979‚Äì1981 and completed studies in broadcasting at the New York Institute of Technology, United States. He and his wife have had two children, the eldest son, Yi Kwon (Ïù¥Í∂å), born in 1998; the other son, Yi Yeong (Ïù¥ÏòÅ), born in 1999. He currently lives in an apartment in Wondang, Goyang, Gyeonggi province, Korea with his family.  Adoption controversy  Following the death of Yi Ku, who died on 16 July 2005, the Jeonju Lee Royal Family Association appointed him as the next Head of Korean Imperial Household and they also made his title the Hereditary Prince Imperial (Hwangsason) in the meaning of inherited a title of Yi Ku. According to the chairman of the association, Lee Hwan-ey (Ïù¥ÌôòÏùò, ÊùéÊ°ìÂÑÄ), in his last meeting with Yi Ku was on July 10, Yi Won was allowed to become his heir and Yi Ku signed for granting permission. Another meeting held on July 21, within the association, was to determine whether Yi Won could be the successor of Yi Ku. Eventually, Yi Won's status as Yi Ku's successor was confirmed by the Jeonju Lee Royal Family Association as of 22 July 2005. This claim was contested by his half-aunt, Yi Hae-won, who was crowned \\"Empress of Korea\\" by some of her relatives. In spite of this, he is annually called on to take the place of the sovereign at the Jongmyo jerye ceremonies performing rites to his royal ancestors. Those who dispute the legitimacy of the adoption claim that consent for the adoption of Yi Won was not given by other members of Imperial House, including Yi Seok, the younger half-brother of Prince Gap, and Yi Hae-won, the eldest member of the house before her death in 2020. Also, Yi Ku died before the adoption process could complete; as such, according to present Korean law, a traditional posthumous adoption was no longer recognized by legislation as of 2004.http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2831239 AncestrySee also *House of Yi *Joseon Dynasty References External links  * Coronation of Korea‚Äôs new empress leads to royal family controversy * English Donga article mentioning Yi Won Category:Pretenders to the Korean throne Won Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:People from Gyeonggi Province Category:Korean anti-communists Category:New York Institute of Technology alumni ","title":"Yi Won"},{"id":"2302186","text":"Ghadames or Ghadamis (Berber:  ïademis; , Libyan vernacular: …£dƒÅm…ôs, Latin: Cidamus, Cydamus, ) is an oasis Berber town in the Nalut District of the Tripolitania region in northwestern Libya. The indigenous language of Ghadames is Ghadam√®s, a Berber language. Ghadam√®s, known as 'the pearl of the desert', stands in an oasis. It is one of the oldest pre-Saharan cities and an outstanding example of a traditional settlement. Its domestic architecture is characterized by a vertical division of functions: the ground floor used to store supplies; then another floor for the family, overhanging covered alleys that create what is almost an underground network of passageways; and, at the top, open-air terraces reserved for the women. Geography Ghadames lies roughly to the southwest of Tripoli, near the borders with Algeria and Tunisia. Ghadames borders Illizi Province, Algeria and Tataouine Governorate, Tunisia. The oasis has a population of around 10,000, mainly Berbers. The old part of the town, which is surrounded by a city wall, has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. Each of the seven clans that used to live in this part of the town had its own district, of which each had a public place where festivals could be held. Climate Ghadames has a hot desert climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BWh) with long, extremely hot summers as average high temperature is around 41 ¬∞C (105.8 ¬∞F) in July, the hottest month of the year as well as short, warm winters. The town receives little precipitation throughout the year as average annual precipitation is only 33.1 mm (1.30 in). History=Ancient eras= Houses in Ghadames are made of mud, lime, and palm tree trunks with covered alleyways between them to offer good shelter against summer heat. It has been suggested, based on archaeological evidence, that this area has been settled since the 4th millennium B.C., and is one of the oldest pre-Saharan settlements. Its situation near a water source in the middle of a desert would have made it an important spot for anyone seeking to settle in the area. The first written records about Ghadames date from the Roman period when the settlement was known as Cydamus, from which modern Ghadames derives its name. In the 1st century BC, the Roman proconsul Lucius Cornelius Balbus invaded Cydamus during the reign of emperor Augustus. A permanent Roman garrison was established during the reign of Septimius Severus, and the emperor may have visited the settlement around AD 202.Birley, Anthony R. Septimius Severus: The African Emperor. London: Routledge. (2000) [1971]. pg 147. However, the Romans withdrew from the area a few decades later during the Crisis of the Third Century. During the 6th century, a Bishop lived in the oasis, after the population had been converted to Christianity by Byzantine missionaries. It became a stronghold of the Donatist heresy until its conquest by Muslim Arabs. During the late 7th century, Ghadames was ruled by the Muslim Arabs. The population quickly converted to Islam and Ghadames played an important role as base for the Trans-Saharan trade until the 19th century. =Etymology= The etymology of the name Ghadames is very closely linked with its history. It is believed that the name Ghadames is originally connected to the name of the ancient Berber tribe of Tidamensi, a tribe from Fezzan. It is also believed that the name Tidamensi was corrupted by the invading Romans to form the name Cydamus, which in turn gave way to the name Ghadames. =1900s‚Äìpresent= In October 1911, shortly after the Italo-Turkish War broke out, Ghadames was occupied by Italian soldiers marching from Tripoli. However, Italy's hold on the city was interrupted several times until June 1915, when a general rising throughout Libya caused the Italian garrison to retreat from Ghadames to the stronghold of Tripoli. Effective control over the city was restored in December 1918, but rebellion throughout Fezzan kept Ghadames in a state of emergency until 1923. In 1943, Free French forces occupied Ghadames and its surrounding area in the southern part of the former Italian colony of Libya, forming the Military Territory of Fezzan-Ghadames until Libyan independence in 1951. Ghadames was made the territory's capital during this time. In the 1970s, the government built new houses outside of the old part of the town. However, many inhabitants return to the old part of the town during the summer, as its architecture provides better protection against the heat. During the Libyan Civil War, National Transitional Council forces entered the town on 30 August 2011, which had been under siege by NTC forces since the beginning of the conflict. Until 2011, the city was under control by independent Tuareg troops.Libya: what about the south? The Guardian, 24 August 2011 After being captured by the Libyan National Army, the entire Tuareg community was forced to flee in an act of ethnic cleansing.  Old Town of Ghadames  The old town, inscribed in 1986 as a UNESCO World Heritage site, was de-populated of its inhabitants throughout the 1990s, leaving the old buildings at risk of collapse due to a lack of maintenance.The World Heritage Newsletter, No.9, December 1995. It has been listed on the List of World Heritage in Danger since 2016 among four other sites in Libya, because of damage caused by the Libyan Civil War affecting the country and the threat of further damage it poses. =Gallery= Image:Libya Ghadames Old Town Inside of small dwelling.JPGInside view of a small dwelling Image:Libya Ghadames Old Town Rooftop View.JPGOld Town Rooftop View Image:Libya Ghadames Old Town Spring Water Pool.JPGOld Town Spring Water Pool Image:Libya Ghadames Old Town Wall Entrance.JPGOld Town Wall Entrance Image:Libya Ghadames Old Town Fruit Trees.JPGFruit Trees in the Old Town See also * Ghadames Museum * Ghadames Airport * List of cities in Libya ReferencesFurther reading * * Lafi (Nora) \\"Ghadam√®s cit√©-oasis entre empire ottoman et colonisation\\"\\" in Federico Cresti (ed.), La Libia tra Mediterraneo e mondo islamico, Giuffr√®, pp.55-70, 2006 External links * Falling Rain Genomics, Inc.: \\"Ghadamis, Libya\\" * Azzouz, Intisar (1980) \\"Ghadames, Libya\\" In Safran, Linda (ed) (1980) Places of Public Gathering in Islam: proceedings of seminar five in the series Architectural transformations in the Islamic world, held in Amman, Jordan, May 4‚Äì7 Aga Khan Award for Architecture, Philadelphia, ; photographs of Ghadames.

Prior to German reunification in 1990, the two German states had different forms for the Ampelm√§nnchen, with a generic human figure in West Germany, and a generally \\"male\\" figure wearing a hat in the East. The Ampelm√§nnchen is a beloved symbol in Eastern Germany, \\"enjoy[ing] the privileged status of being one of the few features of East Germany to have survived the end of the Iron Curtain with his popularity unscathed.\\" After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Ampelm√§nnchen acquired cult status and became a popular souvenir item in the tourism business. Concept and design Karl Peglau's proposal for a traffic lights layout (left) compared to modern traffic lights (right) The first traffic lights at pedestrian crossings were erected in the 1950s, and many countries developed different designs (which were eventually standardised). At that time, traffic lights were the same for cars, bicycles and pedestrians. The East Berlin Ampelm√§nnchen was created in 1961 by traffic psychologist Karl Peglau (1927‚Äì2009) as part of a proposal for a new traffic lights layout. Peglau criticised the fact that the standard colours of the traffic lights (red, yellow, green) did not provide for road users who were unable to differentiate between colours (10 percent of the total population); and that the lights themselves were too small and too weak when competing against luminous advertising and sunlight. Peglau proposed retaining the three colours while introducing intuitive shapes for each coloured light. This idea received strong support from many sides, but Peglau's plans were doomed by the high costs involved in replacing existing traffic light infrastructure. Unlike motor traffic, pedestrian traffic has no constraints for age or health (physical or mental), and therefore must allow for children, elderly people and the handicapped. Peglau therefore resorted to the realistic-concrete scheme of a little man that is comprehensible for everyone and appeals to archetypical shapes. The thick outstretched arms of the frontal-standing red man is associated with the function of a blocking barricade to signal \\"stop\\", while the side-facing green man with his wide- paced legs is associated with a dynamic arrow, signalling the permission to \\"go ahead\\". The yellow light was abandoned because of generally unhurried pedestrian traffic. Peglau's secretary Anneliese Wegner drew the Ampelm√§nnchen per his suggestions. The initial concept envisioned the Ampelm√§nnchen to have fingers, but this idea was dropped for technical reasons of illumination. However, the man's \\"perky\\", \\"cheerful\\" and potentially \\"petit bourgeois\\" hat ‚Äì inspired by a summer photo of Erich Honecker in a straw hat ‚Äì was retained, to Peglau's surprise. The prototypes of the Ampelm√§nnchen traffic lights were built at the VEB-Leuchtenbau Berlin. The Ampelm√§nnchen was officially introduced on 13 October 1961 in Berlin, at which time the media attention and public interest focused on the new traffic lights, not the symbols. The first Ampelm√§nnchen were produced as cheap decal pictures. Beginning in 1973, the Ampelm√§nnchen traffic lights were produced at VEB Signaltechnik Wildenfels and privately owned artisan shops. Decades later, Daniel Meuren of the weekly German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, described the Ampelm√§nnchen as uniting \\"beauty with efficiency, charm with utility, [and] sociability with fulfilment of duties\\". The Ampelm√§nnchen reminded others of a childlike figure with big head and short legs, or a religious leader. The Ampelm√§nnchen proved so popular that parents and teachers initiated the symbol to become part of road safety education for children in the early 1980s. The East German Ministry of the Interior had the idea to bring the two traffic light figures to life and turn them into advisors. Die Ampelm√§nnchen were introduced with much media publicity. They appeared in strip cartoons, also in situations without traffic lights. The red Ampelm√§nnchen appeared in potentially dangerous environments, and the green Ampelm√§nnchen was an advisor. Together with the Junge Welt publishing company, games with the Ampelm√§nnchen were developed. Ampelm√§nnchen stories were developed for radio broadcasts. Partly animated Ampelm√§nnchen stories with the name Stiefelchen und Kompa√ükalle were broadcast once a month as part of the East German children's bedtime television programme Sandm√§nnchen, which had one of the largest viewing audiences in East Germany. The animated Ampelm√§nnchen stories raised international interest, and the Czech festival for road safety education films awarded Stiefelchen und Kompa√ükalle the Special Award by the Jury and the Main Prize for Overall Accomplishments in 1984. History after Reunification Pan-German Ampelm√§nnchen in Chemnitz Ampelm√§nnchen in Berlin Following the German unification in 1990, there were attempts to standardise all traffic signs to the West German forms. East German street signs and traffic signs were dismantled and replaced because of differing fonts in the former two German countries. The East German education programmes featuring the Ampelm√§nnchen vanished. This led to calls to save the East German Ampelm√§nnchen as a part of the East German culture. The first solidarity campaigns for the Ampelm√§nnchen took place in Berlin in early 1995. Markus Heckhausen, a graphic designer from the West German city of T√ºbingen and founder of Ampelmann GmbH in Berlin, had first noticed the Ampelm√§nnchen during his visits to East Berlin in the 1980s. When he was looking for new design possibilities in 1995, he had the idea to collect dismantled Ampelm√§nnchen and build lamps. But he had difficulty finding old Ampelm√§nnchen and eventually contacted the former VEB Signaltechnik (now Signaltechnik Ro√überg GmbH) regarding their excess stock. The company was still producing Ampelm√§nnchen, and liked Heckhausen's marketing ideas. The public embraced Heckhausen's first six lamp models. Local newspapers published full-page articles, followed by articles in national newspapers and designer magazines. The successful German daily Soap opera Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten used the Ampelm√§nnchen lamp in their coffeehouse set. Designer Karl Peglau explained the public reaction in 1997: > \\"It is presumably their special, almost indescribable aura of human snugness > and warmth, when humans are comfortably touched by this traffic symbol > figure and find a piece of honest historical identification, giving the > Ampelm√§nnchen the right to represent a positive aspect of a failed social > order.\\" The Ampelm√§nnchen became a virtual mascot for the East German nostalgia movement, known as Ostalgie. The protests were successful, and the Ampelm√§nnchen returned to pedestrian crossings. They can now also be seen in some western districts of Berlin. Some western German cities such as Saarbr√ºcken and Heidelberg have since adopted the design for some intersections. Peter Becker, marshal of Saarbr√ºcken, explained that lights of the East German Ampelm√§nnchen have greater signal strength than West German traffic lights, and \\"in our experience people react better to the East German Ampelm√§nnchen than the West German ones.\\" In Heidelberg, however, a government department asked the city to stop the installation of more East German Ampelm√§nnchen, citing standards in road traffic regulations. Tourist souvenirs featuring the East German traffic lights. Heckhausen continued to incorporate the Ampelm√§nnchen design into products and had an assortment of over forty Ampelm√§nnchen souvenir products in 2004, reportedly earning ‚Ç¨2 million yearly. In the meantime, Joachim Rossberg claimed to make ‚Ç¨50,000 per year from merchandise. Heckhausen appealed to a Leipzig court in 2005 over the marketing rights, suing Rossberg for failing at making full use of his marketing rights; German legislature rules state that if no use of marketing rights is made for five years, the rights can be cancelled. The court ruled in 2006 that Rossberg's right to use the Ampelm√§nnchen as a marketing brand had largely lapsed and had passed back into the public domain. Rossberg only retained the right to use the symbol to market liqueur, and may no longer use the logo on beer and T-shirts. The court case was later seen by some as part of the cultural and political struggle between residents of the two parts of the reunified country, in which the underdog East generally lost. Berlin started to modernize its traffic lights from using regular light bulbs to LED technology in early 2006, which promised better visibility and lower maintenance costs. Variations There are three Ampelm√§nnchen variations in modern-day Germany ‚Äì the old East German version, the old West German version, and the pan-German Ampelm√§nnchen introduced in 1992. Each German state holds the right to determine the version used. East Germans have changed the look of Ampelm√§nnchen traffic lights as a joke since the early 1980s; this turned into media-effective efforts to call attention to the vanishing East German Ampelm√§nnchen in the 1990s. The Ampelm√§nnchen on several traffic lights in Erfurt were changed through manipulation of the template, showing Ampelm√§nnchen carrying backpacks or cameras. In 2004, Joachim Rossberg invented the female counterpart to the Ampelm√§nnchen, the Ampelfrau, which was installed on some traffic lights in Zwickau, Dresden and F√ºrstenwalde. = Art collective Ztohoven = Roman Tic (a pseudonym playing with \\"romantic\\") of the art collective Ztohoven (\\"(The way) Out of shit\\") changed some pedestrian traffic lights in the daylight hours of 8 April 2007 in five hours work, with a ladder and wearing red overalls.

The TCA accepts applications and selects members twice per year in March and September. Once selected, all members meet at The Langham Huntington Hotel and Spa in Pasadena, California in January for the winter press tour, and at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills in July for the summer press tour. Winter press tour usually covers network midseason replacements, programs from streaming services and cable series which start in January, while the summer tour covers the new fall season for broadcast, streaming, and cable programming. Press tours The tour allows the major television networks, cable networks, online streaming services and PBS to present their slate of upcoming programs to a large group of press writers from different outlets all at once through panels and interviews, along with 'state of the network' speeches and presentations; for instance, FX executive John Landgraf uses his network's winter session to present data and analytical information from his network's research department, including the number of series carried across all American networks and streaming services in a year to compare with FX's slate of original programming. This is also the only time the general television media has rare access en masse to network executives. These biannual conferences involve registered TCA members staying at a chosen Los Angeles venue for two to three weeks, and each network is assigned a series of days to showcase their programming. In the past, these interviews with program casts and creative staff (usually the show's primary showrunner, producers, and writers) were mainly used to compile stories over a six-month period which could be posted over that period as columns, Q&A; responses to reader mail questions timed to a program/film/special's release, or within their weekly television listings supplements, mainly in newspapers or magazines for critics and columnists outside of large metropolitan areas. However, with the rise of the Internet and social media, these sessions now function to build buzz for programming within an immediate period, and only a few columnists for smaller publications and listing supplements maintain the former format of story release. The January 2008 tour was canceled in December 2007 because of the 2007-08 Writers Guild of America strike and the uncertainty of its settlement.\\"January 2008 TCA Press Tour Cancelled\\" ‚Äì TVCritics.org At the start of May 2020, the organization cancelled their summer 2020 tour and delayed the TCA Awards to a time to be determined in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic making any large gathering over two weeks impossible, along with the uncertainty over the 2020-21 television season, including the conversion of network upfront presentations to videotelephony platforms and the ability to produce programming.

Gaston Alexandre Auguste, Marquis de Galliffet, Prince de Martigues (Paris, 23 January 1830 ‚Äì 8 July 1909), was a French general, best known for having taken part in the repression of the 1871 Paris Commune. He was Minister of War in Waldeck-Rousseau's cabinet at the turn of the century, which caused a controversy in the socialist movement, since independent socialist Alexandre Millerand also took part in the same government, and was thus side by side with the Fusilleur de la Commune (the \\"Commune's executioner\\").  Military interventions and Minister of War  Gaston Galliffet entered the army in 1848 and was commissioned as a sub- lieutenant in 1853. He served with distinction at the Siege of Sevastopol in 1855, in the Austro-Sardinian War of 1859, and in Algeria in 1860, after which for a time he served on the personal staff of the emperor, Napoleon III. During Napoleon III's intervention in Mexico, Galliffet displayed great gallantry in 1863 as a captain at the siege and storming of Puebla, when he was severely wounded. When he returned to France to recover from his wounds, he was entrusted with the task of presenting the captured standards and colours to the emperor, and was promoted chef d'escadron. He returned to Algeria in 1864, took part in expeditions against the Arabs, returned to Mexico as a lieutenant-colonel and, after winning further distinction, became in 1867 colonel of the 3rd Chasseurs d'Afrique. In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì71, he commanded this regiment in the Army of the Rhine, until promoted to General de Brigade on 30 August. At the Battle of Sedan, which marked the defeat of Napoleon III and the subsequent collapse of the Second Empire, he led the brigade of Chasseurs d'Afrique in the heroic charge of General Margueritte's cavalry division, which earned him the admiration of the old king of Prussia. Made prisoner of war at the capitulation, he returned to France during the siege of Paris by the French Army of Versailles, and commanded a brigade during the repression of the 1871 Paris Commune. He was henceforth one of the most criticised figures in French public life, along with Adolphe Thiers who had directed the assault. In the suppression of the Paris Commune, he did his duty, as he saw it, rigorously and inflexibly, and earned a reputation for severity, which, throughout his later career, made him the object of unceasing attacks in the press and the chamber of deputies. In 1872, he took command of the Batna subdivision of Algeria, and commanded an expedition against El Golea, surmounting great difficulties in a rapid march across the desert, and inflicting severe defeats on the revolting tribes. On the general reorganisation of the army, he commanded the 31st infantry brigade. Promoted General de Division in 1875, he successively commanded the 15th infantry division at Dijon, the IX army corps at Tours, and in 1882 the XII army corps at Limoges. In 1885, he became a member of the Conseil Sup√©rieur de la Guerre. He conducted the cavalry manoeuvres in successive years, and attained a Europe-wide reputation on all cavalry questions and, indeed, as an army commander. Decorated Grand Officer of the L√©gion d'Honneur in 1880 by L√©on Gambetta, he was appointed governor of Paris. In 1887, he was also decorated with the Grand Cross of the L√©gion d'Honneur. He then received the Military Medal for his able conduct of the autumn manoeuvres in 1891. After again commanding at the manoeuvres of 1894, he retired from the active list. Later, he took an important part in French politics, as war minister (22 June 1899 to 29 May 1900) in Waldeck-Rousseau's cabinet, and distinguished himself by the firmness with which he dealt with cases of unrest in the army in the midst of the Dreyfus Affair. Galliffet then retired into private life, and died on 8 July 1909, aged 79.

She was named for John Drake Sloat. History Sloat was laid down on 18 January 1919 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, San Francisco, California; launched on 14 May 1919; sponsored by Mrs. Edwin A. Sherman; and commissioned on 30 December 1920, Lieutenant Commander J. R. Palmer in command. Sloat arrived at San Diego, California for shakedown on 24 January 1921 and then was placed in reserve until October. She conducted gunnery exercises during the winter and carried out torpedo trials in April and May 1922. On 27 June, she sailed with the fleet for Puget Sound and operated in that area until returning to San Diego on 19 September. On 6 February 1923, she departed San Diego with the fleet, and conducted exercises off Panama until returning on 11 April. She spent most of the remainder of the year, and much of the next, undergoing repairs at Mare Island before returning to San Diego on 22 December 1924. On 3 April 1925, Sloat sailed from San Diego with the fleet for exercises off Hawaii. On 1 July, the Battle Fleet sailed from Hawaii for a goodwill cruise to the Southwest Pacific, and Sloat called at Melbourne, Australia; Lyttelton and Wellington, New Zealand; and American Samoa before returning to San Diego on 19 September. The destroyer departed San Diego on 1 February 1926 and participated in fleet exercises off Panama from 15 February to 8 March, and then underwent overhaul at Mare Island from 22 March to 4 May. After a summer of reserve training cruises, she again underwent repairs at Mare Island from 30 December 1926 to 3 February 1927. Sloat sailed with the Battle Fleet for fleet exercises on 17 February 1927 and transited the Panama Canal on 5 March. The exercises in the Caribbean lasted until 22 April, and the fleet then visited New York and carried out a joint Army and Navy exercise in Narragansett Bay before arriving in Hampton Roads on 29 May for a Presidential review. After getting underway for Panama on 4 June, Sloat received repairs from a tender in Gatun Lake, Canal Zone, and then was ordered to relieve on patrol off the Nicaraguan coast. Her mission was to protect lives and property of United States citizens and of other foreign nationals in Nicaragua and to help preserve order. She served two tours off Nicaragua under the Special Service Squadron: from 25 June to 6 July and from 22 July to 8 August 1927. Transiting the canal on 10 August, she returned to San Diego on 23 August and underwent overhaul at Mare Island from 19 February to 31 March 1928. Sloat departed San Diego on 9 April 1928 and arrived at Pearl Harbor with the fleet on the 28th, having participated in Fleet Problem VIII en route. She returned to San Diego on 23 June and reached Puget Sound on 9 July for summer exercises. Returning to San Diego on 1 September, she took part in exercises off the Canal Zone from 27 January to 6 February 1929 and then underwent overhaul at Mare Island from 3 March to 13 April. She conducted training off San Diego during the summer; and, after a one-week trip to San Francisco, returned to San Diego on 28 August 1929. Sloat was replaced by the recommissioned and decommissioned on 2 June 1930, struck from the Navy list on 28 January 1935, and sunk at sea as a target off San Diego on 26 June 1935.

Biography Edgar Pangborn was born in New York City on February 25, 1909, to Harry Levi Pangborn, an attorney and dictionary editor, and Georgia Wood Pangborn, a noted writer of supernatural fiction. Along with his older sister Mary, Edgar was homeschooled until 1919 and then educated at Brooklyn Friends School. He began music studies at Harvard University in 1924, when he was still only 15 years old, and left in 1926 without graduating. After that he studied at the New England Conservatory of Music, but did not graduate from that school, either. On leaving he publicly abandoned music, shifting his creative focus to writing. His first novel, a mystery called A-100: A Mystery Story, was published under the pseudonym \\"Bruce Harrison\\" in 1930. It was not an auspicious or notably successful debut, and showed none of the emotional or stylistic characteristics that became the hallmark of his later work. Over the next 20 years he wrote numerous stories for the pulp detective and mystery magazines, always under pseudonyms. He also spent three years (1939‚Äì1942) farming in rural Maine, and three years (1942‚Äì1945) doing his World War II military service in the Pacific with the U.S. Army Medical Corps. It was not until the early 1950s that Edgar \\"suddenly appeared\\" within the science fiction and mystery fields, publishing a string of high-quality, high-profile stories under his own name in prominent magazines like Galaxy Science Fiction, The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, and Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine. His work helped to firmly establish a new \\"humanist\\" school of science fiction, and inspired a subsequent generation of writers, including Peter S. Beagle and Ursula K. Le Guin, who has credited Pangborn and Theodore Sturgeon with convincing her that it was possible to write worthwhile, humanly emotional stories within science fiction and fantasy. In the 1960s Pangborn also began painting semi-professionally in oils, and exhibited portraits, nudes, and landscape paintings at local and regional art shows. He continued to write in all genres until he died in Bearsville, New York on February 1, 1976, twenty-four days away from his 67th birthday. Twenty-seven years later, in 2003, he was named winner of that year's Cordwainer Smith Rediscovery Award. In 2018, he was named a \\"Ghost of Honor\\" at WorldCon 76 (San Jose, CA). Writing Pangborn came from a writing family. His mother, Georgia Wood Pangborn, was a noted writer of ghost stories that appeared regularly in such popular mainstream periodicals as Scribner's Magazine, Harper's Monthly, Woman's Home Companion, and others. His father, Harry Levi Pangborn, worked as an editor of Webster's Dictionary. Words and literature were a part of the Pangborn household from the very beginning. As children, Edgar and his sister Mary carried on the tradition by writing an extensive series of fanciful, handwritten storybooks, often collaborating on these with each other and also their mother. For the first 20 years of his writing career, which started when he was 21, Pangborn wrote what he referred to as \\"literary hackwork\\" for the pulp magazines. His serious work began in 1951, with the publication of his first science fiction story, \\"Angel's Egg\\", in Galaxy Science Fiction. The story of a race of tiny winged beings who come to Earth to help mankind, as told by a kindly biologist, it has been translated into six languages and reprinted more than twenty times. By 1954, Pangborn was well known and his second science fiction novel, A Mirror for Observers won the International Fantasy Award. This book is told from the point of view of a \\"Salvayan\\" (Martian) observer on Earth, who struggles with another Martian over the fate of a gifted young man. Galaxy reviewer Groff Conklin described Mirror as a \\"beautiful and moving book . . . told in little details which make the tragedy all the more impressive.\\"\\"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf\\", Galaxy Science Fiction, June 1954, p. 119. From there Pangborn continued writing in science fiction and in other genres as well, including the historical novel Wilderness of Spring and the contemporary courtroom drama The Trial of Callista Blake. In 1954 Pangborn wrote '\\"The Music Master of Babylon\\", a story set in the ruins of post- apocalypse New York and clearly related to Stephen Vincent Ben√©t's 1937 \\"By the Waters of Babylon\\", already considered a classic. Pangborn's best-known book, the Hugo-nominated Davy of 1964, is set in a much later part-time of that post-apocalyptic future. It is a picaresque bildungsroman set in a repressive theocratic society which developed out of the ruins of the destroyed old world. This post-apocalyptic world eventually became the backdrop for most of Pangborn's short fiction and his last novel, The Company of Glory (though not the Hugo-nominated \\"Longtooth\\", nor the 1971 Nebula finalist \\"Mount Charity\\"). Because of his educational background and early interests, Pangborn's works often deal with musical themes. Music plays a prominent role both in Davy and A Mirror For Observers. Pangborn's works are also known for being humane and poignant in a way that nevertheless allows for some dark themes and raunchy humor. In his introduction to Pangborn's posthumous story collection Still I Persist In Wondering, Spider Robinson observed: \\"[Pangborn] said again and again in his books that love is not a condition or an event or even a state of mind‚Äîthat love is a country, which we are sometimes privileged to visit.\\" Music Edgar never discussed his early musical training in detail with anyone in the science fiction, fantasy, or mystery fields. It was known that he studied the piano and violin, but that was all. In 2003, however, a large stack of handwritten music manuscripts were discovered in the attic of the Bearsville house in which Edgar died. These manuscripts included original string quartets, sonatas, nocturnes, and other orchestral forms written by Edgar during his music conservatory days. The scores are now being converted to digital notation files that will allow MIDI playback, so they can finally be heard.

Gershwin completed the work in 1936 and it premiered at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia on January 21 of that year, with Alexander Smallens conducting the Philadelphia Orchestra. Gershwin played the piano part, including the piano solo in the opening moments. This piece preserves some of the darkest and most complex music Gershwin ever wrote. It should not be confused with Porgy and Bess: A Symphonic Picture, scored at the behest of Fritz Reiner by Robert Russell Bennett in 1942, and premiered by the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in 1943. Movements # Catfish Row contains the Introduction, \\"Jazzbo Brown's Piano Blues\\", which was cut from the opera until 1976 (a motive from this music is first heard in the orchestral Introduction, which was actually composed later), and the first iteration of \\"Summertime\\" with a short coda. The coda consists of the opening bars of the \\"crap game\\" music, which immediately follows \\"Summertime\\" in the opera. # Porgy Sings contains one of Porgy's arias: \\"I Got Plenty o' Nuttin\\" and Porgy and Bess's duet \\"Bess, You Is My Woman Now\\" bridged by a cello solo (the introduction to the latter song). # Fugue contains the dark dissonant music from the murder of Crown in Act III scene 1. # Hurricane features the music from the hurricane sequence (12 more measures than the R. R. Bennett Porgy and Bess \\"Symphonic Picture\\" medley). # Good Morning, Sistuh contains the Act III Prelude from the final scene of the opera, as well as the final song, \\"Oh, Lawd, I'm on My Way\\". Instrumentation Catfish Row is scored for two flutes (the second doubling piccolo), two oboes (the second doubling English horn), four clarinets in B-Flat (the fourth doubling bass clarinet in B-Flat), one bassoon, three French horns in F, three trumpets in B-Flat, two trombones, one tuba; a percussion section that includes timpani, drum set, xylophone, cymbals, snare drum, bass drum, tubular bells, tom-tom, wood block, suspended cymbal, glockenspiel and triangle; one piano; one banjo and strings History Gershwin conducted all of the ensuing performances before his death in 1937, and many scholars have pronounced it unperformed and virtually forgotten until its March 1958 rediscovery by Ira Gershwin's secretary, Lawrence D. Stewart. It did, however, receive a 14 April 1942 performance by Pierre Monteux and the San Francisco Symphony. Another performance was scheduled and publicized by the Minneapolis Symphony for the very next day (15 April 1942), but couldn't be given because there was then only one set of performance materials (score & parts) for the work (Ferencz, 2011). In 1958, Ira Gershwin decided to re-title the work \\"Catfish Row\\" to distinguish it from Robert Russell Bennett's medley, though its first (1959) recording, by the Utah Symphony, nonetheless used the original title. Preservation status On September 22, 2013, it was announced that a musicological critical edition of the full orchestral score will be eventually released. The Gershwin family, working in conjunction with the Library of Congress and the University of Michigan, are working to make scores available to the public that represent Gershwin's true intent. The entire Gershwin project may take 30 to 40 years to complete. Some recordings (such as a January 1990 recording by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and a December 2014 performance by the New York Philharmonic) include extra incidental music from the opera in the third and fifth movements, it is unknown if the critical edition score will include this material.

The counterpart to gross anatomy is the field of histology, which studies microscopic anatomy. Gross anatomy of the human body or other animals seeks to understand the relationship between components of an organism in order to gain a greater appreciation of the roles of those components and their relationships in maintaining the functions of life. The study of gross anatomy can be performed on deceased organisms using dissection or on living organisms using medical imaging. Education in the gross anatomy of humans is included training of most health professionals. Techniques of study Gross anatomy is studied using both invasive and noninvasive methods with the goal of obtaining information of the macroscopic structure and organization of organs and organ systems. Among the most common methods of study is dissection, in which the corpse of an animal or a human cadaver is surgically opened and its organs studied. Endoscopy, in which a video camera-equipped instrument is inserted through a small incision in the subject, may be used to explore the internal organs and other structures of living animals. The anatomy of the circulatory system in a living animal may be studied noninvasively via angiography, a technique in which blood vessels are visualized after being injected with an opaque dye. Other means of study include radiological techniques of imaging, such as X-ray and MRI. In medical and healthcare professional education Most health profession schools, such as medical, physician assistant, and dental schools, require that students complete a practical (dissection) course in gross human anatomy. Such courses aim to educate students in basic human anatomy and seek to establish anatomical landmarks that may later be used to aid medical diagnosis. Many schools provide students with cadavers for investigation by dissection, aided by dissection manuals, as well as cadaveric atlases (e.g. Netter's, Rohen's). Working intimately with a cadaver during a gross anatomy course has been shown to capture the essence of the patient-provider relationship. However, the expense of maintaining cadaveric dissection facilities has limited the time and resources available for gross anatomy teaching in many medical schools, with some adopting alternative prosection-based or simulated teaching. This, coupled with decreasing time dedicated to gross anatomical courses within the growing greater medical school curriculum, has caused controversy surrounding the sufficiency of anatomical teaching with nearly half of newly qualified doctors believing they received insufficient anatomy teaching. Medical schools have implemented on-screen anatomical lessons and tutorials to teach students surgical procedures. The use of technological visual aids and gross dissection are more effective together than either approach alone. Recently, online flashcards and quizzes have been used as well.

Claude- Matthieu, Comte de Gardane (11 July 1766 in Marseille ‚Äì 30 January 1818) was a French general and diplomat. He entered the army and rose rapidly during the revolutionary wars, becoming captain in 1793. In May 1799 he distinguished himself by saving a division of the French army which was about to be crushed by the Russians at the battle of Bassignana, and was named at once brigadier- general by Moreau. He incurred Napoleon's displeasure for an omission of duty shortly before the battle of Marengo (June, 1800), but in 1805 was appointed to be aide-de-camp of the emperor. His chief distinction, however, was to be won in the diplomatic sphere. In the spring of 1807, when Russia and Prussia were at war with France, and the emperor Alexander I of Russia was also engaged in hostilities with Persia. The court of Tehran sent a mission to the French emperor, then at the Finckenstein Palace in East Prussia, with a view to the conclusion of a Franco-Persian alliance. The Treaty of Finckenstein was signed on 4 May 1807, at that castle; and Napoleon designed Gardane as special envoy for the cementing of that alliance. The secret instructions which he drew up for Gardane, and signed on 30 May, are of interest as showing the strong oriental trend of the emperor's policy. France was to guarantee the integrity of Persia, to recognize that Georgia (then being invaded by the Russians) belonged to the shah, and was to make all possible efforts for restoring that territory to him. He was also to furnish to the shah arms, officers and workmen, in the number and to the amount demanded by him. Napoleon on his side required Persia to declare war against Great Britain to expel all Britons from her territory. Gardane, whose family was well known in the Levant, had a long and dangerous journey overland, but was cordially received at Tehran in December 1807. The conclusion of the Franco-Russian treaty at Tilsit in July 1807 rendered the mission abortive. Persia longed only for help against Russia who had invaded its Caucasian territories and had no desire, when all hope of that was past, to attack India. The shah, however, promised to expel Britons and to grant to France a commercial treaty. For a time French influence completely replaced that of England at Tehran, and the mission of Sir John Malcolm to that court was not allowed to proceed. Finally, however, Gardane saw that nothing much was to be hoped for in the changed situation of European affairs, and abruptly left the country (April 1809). This conduct was not wholly approved by Napoleon, but he named him count and in 1810 attached him to Marshal Massena's army in Portugal. There, during the disastrous retreat from Santar√©m to Almeida, he suffered a check which brought him into disfavour.

A cardiotocograph is used to monitor the fetal heart rate and presence or absence of uterine contractions. The test is typically termed \\"reactive\\" (also \\"reassuring\\") or \\"nonreactive\\" (also \\"nonreassuring\\"). Premise The premise of the NST is that a well-oxygenated, non-acidemic fetus will spontaneously have temporary increases, termed \\"accelerations,\\" in the fetal heart rate (FHR). Vibroacoustic stimulation can wake the fetus, and is sometimes used to speed up the test or to facilitate further evaluation of a non-reactive nonstress test. Interpretation A nonstress test can be classified as normal, atypical, or abnormal. A normal nonstress test will show a baseline fetal heart rate between 110 and 160 beats per minute with moderate variability (5- to 25-interbeat variability) and 2 qualifying accelerations in 20 minutes with no decelerations. \\"Reactive\\" is defined as the presence of two or more fetal heart rate accelerations within a 20-minute period. Each acceleration must increase the heart rate 15 beats per minute above the baseline rate, and last for at least 15 seconds when the fetus is above 32 weeks' gestation, or 10 beats per minute over 10 seconds when the fetus is at or below 32 weeks' gestation. \\"Non-reactive\\" is defined as fewer than two adequate accelerations during a prolonged period, which may be over an hour. = Confounding factors = An NST may be non-reactive for reasons unrelated to fetal oxygenation status. These include fetal sleep, exposure to central nervous system depressants, exposure to beta-blockers, or chronic smoking during the pregnancy. = Utility = If the nonstress test is reactive, the rate of fetal demise in the following week is approximately 1.9 per 1000. A nonreactive nonstress test has a false positive rate of 75%-90%, and therefore is followed by more definitive testing, which may include a contraction stress test or a biophysical profile.

The school is named after John McDonogh, whose estate originally funded the school. The school now enrolls approximately 1,300 students, between 90 and 100 of whom participate in the Upper School's five-day boarding program. McDonogh employs approximately 177 full-time faculty members, more than 80% of whom hold advanced degrees and 20% of whom live on-campus. McDonogh is regarded as one of the Baltimore region's most prestigious preparatory schools and has been called a \\"Power School\\" by Baltimore magazine. The school's students frequently matriculate to Ivy League and other top-ranked colleges and universities. McDonogh's athletic programs have also seen widespread success, particularly in lacrosse, soccer, wrestling, and football, where the school's teams have been nationally ranked in recent years. The school is a member of the Association of Independent Maryland Schools. The school was established outside of Baltimore, Maryland in 1873 and funded by the estate of John McDonogh (1779 - 1850), a former Baltimore resident. Documents in the archives of McDonogh School include letters from his former slaves thanking John McDonogh (prior to 1850) for his giving slaves the opportunity to work to buy their freedom and transport to Africa. McDonogh was established as an all- white, semi-military school for orphan boys, who worked on the farm in exchange for their tuition, room, and board. Paying students arrived in 1922, and day students in 1927. The first African-American student was admitted in 1959. In 1971, the military traditions of the school were discontinued. The school became coeducational in 1975. Full and partial McDonogh scholarships continue to this day, with $5.4 million in need-based aid awarded in the 2017-2018 school year. David J. Farace, the present headmaster, is the 13th head of school. He assumed the position in 2018, succeeding Charles W. Britton. The Upper School offers a college preparatory curriculum that includes courses in English, foreign language, history, mathematics, science, visual and performing arts, and physical education. Honors or Advanced Placement courses are available in all academic departments. Upper School students must also complete a community service requirement. All students perform an academic project independently or in small groups during the final three weeks of their senior year. Academic and personal integrity is emphasized in the Upper School's Honor Code, which is enforced by a student- run Honor Council. The Honor Code reads: The academic calendar at McDonogh follows a trimester system.  The Roots Farm Project  At McDonogh, the Roots Farm performs humanitarian work by growing vegetables and then donating them to local charity organizations. The farm has so far donated 2,064 pounds of produce to charity organizations, and has benefited from 2,850 student service hours.

A death head wearing the Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire, on the sarcophagus of Habsburg emperor Charles VI in the crypt of the Capuchin church in Vienna, Austria. The Triumph of Death in St Maria in Bienno Chandelier of bones and skulls, Sedlec Ossuary, Czech Republic From The Dance of Death by Michael Wolgemut In works of art, the adjective macabre ( or ; ) means \\"having the quality of having a grim or ghastly atmosphere\\". The macabre works to emphasize the details and symbols of death. The term also refers to works particularly gruesome in nature. History This quality is not often found in ancient Greek and Latin writers, though there are traces of it in Apuleius and the author of the Satyricon. Outstanding instances in English literature include the works of John Webster, Robert Louis Stevenson, Mervyn Peake, Charles Dickens, Roald Dahl, Thomas Hardy and Cyril Tourneur. In American literature, authors whose work feature this quality include Edgar Allan Poe, H. P. Lovecraft, and Stephen King. The word has gained its significance from its use in French as la danse macabre for the allegorical representation of the ever-present and universal power of death, known in English as the Dance of Death and in German as Totentanz. The typical form which the allegory takes is that of a series of images in which Death appears, either as a dancing skeleton or as a shrunken shrouded corpse, to people representing every age and condition of life, and leads them all in a dance to the grave. Of the numerous examples painted or sculptured on the walls of cloisters or church yards through medieval Europe, few remain except in woodcuts and engravings. *The series at Basel originally at the Klingenthal, a nunnery in Little Basel, dated from the beginning of the 14th century. In the middle of the 15th century this was moved to the churchyard of the Predigerkloster at Basel, and was restored, probably by Hans Kluber, in 1568. The collapse of the wall in 1805 reduced it to fragments, and only drawings of it remain. * A Dance of Death in its simplest form still survives in the Marienkirche at L√ºbeck as 15th-century painting on the walls of a chapel. Here there are 24 figures in couples, between each is a dancing Death linking the groups by outstretched hands, the whole ring being led by a Death playing on a pipe. * In Tallinn (Reval), Estonia there is a well-known Danse Macabre painting by Bernt Notke displayed at St. Nikolaus Church (Niguliste), dating the end of 15th century. * At Dresden there is a sculptured life-size series in the old Neust√§dter Kirchhoff, moved here from the palace of Duke George in 1701 after a fire. * At Rouen in the cloister of St Maclou there also remains a sculptured danse macabre. * There was a celebrated fresco of the subject in the cloister of Old St Pauls in London. *There was another in the now destroyed Hungerford Chapel at Salisbury, of which only a single woodcut, \\"Death and the Gallant\\", remains. *Of the many engraved reproductions of the Old St Pauls fresco, the most famous is the series drawn by Holbein. The theme continued to inspire artists and musicians long after the medieval period, Schubert's string quartet Death and the Maiden (1824) being one example, and Camille Saint- Sa√´ns' tone poem Danse macabre, op. 40 (1847). In the 20th century, Ingmar Bergman's 1957 film The Seventh Seal has a personified Death, and could thus count as macabre. The origin of this allegory in painting and sculpture is disputed. It occurs as early as the 14th century, and has often been attributed to the overpowering consciousness of the presence of death due to the Black Death and the miseries of the Hundred Years' War. It has also been attributed to a form of the Morality, a dramatic dialogue between Death and his victims in every station of life, ending in a dance off the stage.See Du Cange, Gloss., s.v. Machabaeorum chora. The origin of the peculiar form the allegory has taken has also been found in the dancing skeletons on late Roman sarcophagi and mural paintings at Cumae or Pompeii, and a false connection has been traced with \\"The Triumph of Death\\", attributed to Orcagna, in the Campo Santo at Pisa. Etymology The etymology of the word \\"macabre\\" is uncertain. According to Gaston ParisRomania, xxiv., 131; 1895. it first occurs in the form \\"macabre\\" in Jean le F√®vre's Respit de la mort (1376), Je fis de Macabr√© la danse, and he takes this accented form to be the true one, and traces it in the name of the first painter of the subject. The more usual explanation is based on the Latin name, Machabaeorum chorea (Dance of Maccabees). The seven tortured brothers, with their mother and Eleazar (2 Maccabees 6 and 7) were prominent figures on this hypothesis in the supposed dramatic dialogues.The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (Fifth edition; 2002) states that the origin of \\"macabre\\" perhaps has reference to \\"a miracle play containing the slaughter of the Maccabees.\\" Volume 1, p. 1659. Other connections have been suggested, as for example with St. Macarius, or Macaire, the hermit, who, according to Vasari, is to be identified with the figure pointing to the decaying corpses in the Pisan Triumph of Death, or with an Arabic word maqƒÅbir (ŸÖŸÇÿßÿ®ÿ±), cemeteries (plural of maqbara).

According to Plutarch her name was Volumnia. Veturia came from a patrician family and encouraged her son's involvement in Roman politics. According to Roman historians, Coriolanus was expelled from Rome in the early fifth century BC because he demanded the abolition of the office of Tribune of the Plebs in return for distributing state grain to the starving plebeians. He settled with the Volscians, a people hostile to Rome, while formulating his revenge. Coriolanus and the Volscians marched upon Rome and laid siege to the city. The Romans sent envoys to Coriolanus, but to no avail. Then Veturia, together with Coriolanus' wife Volumnia, plus other family members and matrons of Rome, successfully entreated Coriolanus to break off his siege. The precise versions of the entreaties differ. According to Plutarch, when Veturia came to her son's camp, Coriolanus embraced her and begged her to ally herself with his cause. Veturia refused on behalf of all the Roman citizens and convinced her son to cease his crusade against Rome, throwing herself at his feet and threatening to do harm to herself if he did not retreat. Coriolanus obliged, and marched away from Rome; soon, the angry and frustrated Volscians put him to death. Livy says that Veturia refused to embrace her son, but ultimately convinced him to desist, and is quoted as having said: \\"Before I receive your embrace, let me know whether I have come to an enemy or to a son; whether I am in your camp a captive or a mother? Has length of life and a hapless old age reserved me for this‚Äîto behold you an exile, then an enemy? Could you lay waste this land, which gave you birth and nurtured you? Though you had come with an incensed and vengeful mind, did not your resentment subside when you entered its frontiers? When Rome came within view, did it not occur to you, within these walls my house and guardian gods are, my mother, wife, and children? So then, had I not been a mother, Rome would not be besieged: had I not a son, I might have died free in a free country. But I can now suffer nothing that is not more discreditable to you than distressing to me; nor however wretched I may be, shall I be so long. Look to these, whom, if you persist, either an untimely death or lengthened slavery awaits.\\" Livy also records that sources differ as to Coriolanus' fate, and whether he lived on after the incident. The Romans honored Veturia for her courage, patriotism, and strength in a crisis; she had succeeded where all men before her had failed. She became a model of Roman female virtue. A temple to divine Fortuna was built in honour of her and the other women. She did not ask for any special favors or honors, except that a temple be built as a monument of Female Fortune. Plutarch wrote: \\"The senate, much commending their public spirit, caused the temple to be built and a statue set up in it at the public charge; they, however, made up a sum among themselves, for a second image of Fortune, which the Romans say uttered, as it was putting up, words to this effect, ‚ÄúBlessed of the gods, O women, is your gift.‚Äù\\" In Shakespeare's play Coriolanus, the character of Coriolanus' mother performs much the same function as in the Roman story, but her name has been changed to \\"Volumnia.\\" See also * Veturia (gens) References=Primary sources= *Livy, Ab urbe condita libri II.39.1-40.12'' *Valerius Maximus, Factorum et dictorum memorabilum v.2.1a =Secondary sources= *Beam, Jacob N.

It is led by the devious Shredder and his second in command Karai. The Foot Clan was originally a parody of the criminal ninja clan The Hand in the Daredevil comics. In addition to the obvious similarity in their names, both clans originate from Feudal Japan, practice ninjutsu and black magic, and are now powerful global organized crime rings who are familiar with multiple illegal activities such as; drug smuggling, counterfeiting of money, gunrunning, murder, assassination, computer hacking, theft, and terrorism.  Eastman and Laird's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles  In the universe of Eastman and Laird's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the Foot Clan was founded in Feudal Japan by two men named Sato and Oshi. In Volume 1 Issue 47, the Turtles and Time Mistress Renet traveled to a time prior to the Foot's creation. There, Raphael met Sato and Oshi, and, not realising who they are, he taught them about Ninjutsu. After the Turtles returned to the present, Sato and Oshi decided to follow the ways of the ninja. Oshi declared: \\"We must never again mention the strange shelled creatures. In time, others will join us and we will become a force to be reckoned with. So just as every journey begins with a single step... we shall call ourselves The Foot.\\" The Foot Clan are the most feared clan of warriors and assassins in Japan. Both Hamato Yoshi and Oroku Nagi were members, until one day, Nagi attacked Yoshi's love Tang Shen and Yoshi killed Nagi. Dishonored, Yoshi and Shen fled to New York City, while Nagi's younger brother Oroku Saki was adopted by the clan and was trained to become a fierce ninja. When he was ready, Saki was sent to America to head the New York branch of the Clan. Under his leadership, it took only a year for it to become a powerful and fearsome group. Saki also sought vengeance for his brother and, using the persona of \\"The Shredder\\", he assassinated Yoshi and Shen. Over a decade later, the Ninja Turtles challenged Shredder to a rooftop duel to avenge Yoshi and Shen. Shredder sent his Foot Ninja to fight the Turtles, but they were no match for the Turtles and were eventually defeated. Shredder then fought the Turtles himself, and although he was a more skilled ninja than them, he was killed when he fell off a building carrying a grenade. In the later issues, Shredder was revived to take revenge on the turtles and then revived again as a clone made of worms with mutating as a shark before perishing for good. After Shredder's death, the American Foot fell apart, and the Foot Soldiers began fighting against Shredder's elite guard. Karai, a clan leader from Japan, came here to stop the clan war. She enlisted the Turtles' help in this, in exchange for promising that no Foot shall ever try to avenge the Shredder again. This peace treaty is still in effect in Volume 4 of the comic. In Volume 4 the Foot were given a security contract by the Utroms for their base because the Utroms have a no weapons policy and the Foot are skilled at hand-to-hand combat. At some point, mysterious Aztec warriors started to attack the Foot all over the world. Karai informed Leonardo that the New York Branch of the Foot was all that was left. The Foot Clan's logo is a drawing of a left foot. Issues 3 and 4 of the new Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles feature a Foot mystic with magical abilities, including the power to resurrect the dead. 1987 series and TMNT Adventures The 1987 series and the spin-off TMNT Adventures comics share a similar continuity, and thus the same version of the Foot Clan. The Foot is an ancient ninjutsu clan, founded in Japan in 1583. The Shredder, followed by the Turtles and Splinter, went back and forth in time to try to kill the creator of the Foot Clan. In 1583, Shredder's ancestor Oroku Sancho led a small group of samurai, and Shredder offered to help him find magical artifacts that would give him power and wealth beyond his wildest dreams. Meanwhile, Splinter's ancestor Hamato Koji had been sent to find the same artifacts and did find them with the help of his descendant and the Turtles. One of the artifacts released a dragon, which headed for nearby villages; Splinter and Koji went to stop it while the Turtles went to fight Shredder. Sancho's men captured the Turtles and were about to execute them when Koji arrived, riding the dragon, which he had tamed. Seeing this, Sancho fled in fear, and Koji offered to lead Sancho's men and teach them the ninjutsu art of Shibana-Sama, founding the Foot Clan, so named for the footprint of the dragon in which he stood as he made his speech. (However, according to \\"Blast from the Past\\", the Foot was founded by the noble warrior Shibana-Sama). In 1960s Japan, both Oroku Saki and Hamato Yoshi were part of the Clan. Saki framed Yoshi for trying to murder a visiting sensei and had him exiled to New York City, thus clearing the way to take over the Foot Clan. He then proceeded to turn the Foot Clan into an army of criminals. Over the years, Saki, who became known as The Shredder, moved to the US, allied himself with the alien warlord Krang, and replaced the human Foot Ninja with robotic Foot Soldiers. However, these robots are no match for the Ninja Turtles, who destroy them at every encounter. In the cartoon, The Shredder once considered making more intelligent Foot Soldiers, capable of learning and taking decisions by themselves. However, the idea was quickly abandoned when the first intelligent prototype, named Alpha 1, rebelled against The Shredder. The Foot Clan's logo is a drawing of a right foot, and the Foot Soldiers wear purple and black uniforms featuring the logo on their foreheads. The Foot logo can also be seen on the Technodrome. The Archie TMNT Adventures comics features more advanced Foot Soldiers in addition to the basic model. In the comics, The Shredder also built a giant Foot Soldier, who fought against the Warrior Dragon in New York City. The robot was destroyed when it crashed into the Statue of Liberty. The Foot robot concept allowed the Turtles to destroy the Foot soldiers without any moral thoughts, allowing Leonardo and Raphael to use their weapons more offensively. Meanwhile, the series could keep its younger audience and remain a \\"family show\\". This principle also benefited the video games. IDW Publishing In the IDW Publishing adaption, the Foot Clan existed since the time of feudal Japan where it was founded by a ronin by the name of Takeshi Tatsuo who had been betrayed by his master. The sorceress Kitsune helped Tatsuo, to recover from the severe wounds he had suffered in the assassination attempt. The name of the clan was created by the bloody footprint of Tatsuo whose leg was completely healed by Kitsune ministrations. When Tatsuo was betrayed by his clan are learning that he made a pact with a magician, his mind was born again in the son of his murderer Oroku Saki, the uprooting of the reawakening of his old memories powered over the communities and with Kitsune's counsel the Foot was revived in modern times. In more recent times, the clan under the leadership of Oroku Saki (who was now operating as Shredder) tried to expand its supremacy in New York City. Its Foot Ninja were therefore often sent to amass any science that could help the Foot and also to find new test subjects. In this way, it led to the creation of the mutant arctic fox Alopex. In this endeavor, the Foot Clan also came into contact with the extradimensional warlord General Krang who also wanted to create a mutant army to meet his objectives. An attack by the Foot Clan in the laboratory of Krang's ally Baxter Stockman led by a combination of circumstances to the creation of the Turtles and their father Splinter (who in a previous life had himself belonged to the Foot Clan). Besides Shredder, Kitsune, and a substantial number of Foot Ninjas, other members of the Foot Clan include Karai (who was a descendant of Oroku Saki and the daughter of Oroku Yori), Masato, Dr. Miller, Alopex (a mutated Arctic Fox), Rocksteady, Bebop, Koya (Shredder's pet brown falcon who was later mutated), and Bludgeon (a mutant hammerhead shark). IDW also did a crossover issues with Batman called Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles where the Foot Clan appeared. The first crossover showed the Foot Clan collaborating with the League of Assassins. Movies=1990‚Äì2007= In the first and second movies, the Foot Clan is a group of ninja thieves founded by the Shredder in Japan, but later stationed in New York. The Shredder had taken what Foot Soldiers he had from Japan, and began taking kids from the streets upon moving to New York and training them in Ninjutsu himself. His second-in- command is another Ninjutsu master called Tatsu. In the films, the Foot use the kanji , which translates to \\"demon\\" or \\"ogre\\", as their symbol, worn in their hachimaki or on their backs. The Foot Ninja were no match for the Turtles individually, however their first major confrontation with the Turtles resulted in Raphael beaten nearly to death and the remaining Turtles forced to retreat; all confrontations after showed the Turtles being able to defeat the Foot easily. After the Shredder's apparent death and massive arrests by the NYPD, the clan was reduced to a fraction of its former size by the second film. In the second film, Tatsu tried to take command. He relinquished his claim when the Shredder returned. The clan then kidnapped Professor Jordon Perry of TGRI and forced him to use a mutagen so the Foot Clan could create two mutant warriors named Tokka and Rahzar to fight the Turtles. Although these two mutants were a match for the Turtles in physical strength, the Turtles defeated them by de-mutating them back into normal harmless animals. The Shredder himself apparently died shortly after, while fighting the Turtles. In the fourth film, the Foot is now under leadership of Karai, who has taken control after the Shredder's demise. They have grown in numbers and skill, and offer their services as mercenaries in the film. They are hired by Max Winters to track down and bring in the 13 monsters arriving in New York City. Eventually, they later learn of his intention to send the monsters back to their world with a portal, and that his stone generals have betrayed him by substituting Leonardo for the thirteenth monster in order to use the portal to bring in a new army of monsters to take over the Earth. It was then the Stone Generals demand that Karai and the Foot Clan serve them, but they refused, as they want to honor their deal with Winters. Without hesitation, Karai orders the Foot Clan to help April and Casey find the last monster and lure it into the portal while the Turtles fights the Generals as well as Winters and Splinter warding off new more coming from the portal. After the final monster is sent in to the portal along with the Stone Generals, Karai and the Foot Clan peacefully part ways with the Turtles, reminding them of the Shredder's possible return. =2014 film= In the 2014 live-action film (which is a reboot of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film series), the Foot Clan are no longer considered an international ninja cult, but rather a modern American terrorist organization. Besides Shredder and Karai, the film also introduced Eric Sacks who is Shredder's student, Dr. O'Neil's former lab partner, and the CEO of Sacks Industries. Instead of black unitard-clad masked ninjitsu warriors, they are portrayed as fully armed men that wear black military-like uniforms and often wore kabuki style masks to conceal one's identity. In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows, the Foot Ninjas make their appearance, under leadership of Baxter Stockman to free Shredder. Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation In the 1997-1998 Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation series, the Foot Clan is a street gang, similar to the movies. After Venus defeated The Shredder, Leonardo told the kids that the Foot is a lie, and the clan was disbanded. 2003 series In the 2003 series, the Foot Clan is more similar to its original comic version. The Foot Clan are a group of warriors and assassins that Shredder created 700 years ago in Japan. The Shredder, who in this series is a long-lived Utrom named Ch'rell, has led the Clan since its creation and has turned it into a fearsome and secret group present across the world. The Foot emblem is a red, trident-like footprint (hence the name of the clan), an inverted version of the \\"Three-Toed Sign of the Dragon\\", the symbol of the five warriors who had defeated the original demon known as the Shredder in 300 AD. Thanks to Shredder's knowledge of Utrom technology, the Clan has weapons and equipment centuries ahead of human technology. They once created Foot Mechs in Rogue in the House which were based on Master Splinter, the President, the Prime Minister, and some others. The Foot Clan is divided into several branches: * The most commonly encountered, and seemingly most numerous, branch are the Foot Ninja, the basic warriors of the Foot. They're generally depicted as easily beaten except in very large groups. When Karai started working in New York, they received extra training from her and became much harder for the Turtles to defeat. * The seemingly most-skilled of the clan warriors are the four Elite Foot Ninja. These Foot Clan members serve as the Shredder's elite guard, as well as field commanders on highly important missions. Each carries a different weapon: a trident, a spear, an axe, and a twin bladed sword (aside from their different weapons there's no way to tell them apart). They've all proven extremely deadly fighters, having easily defeated and nearly killed Leonardo when they first appeared. When the other Turtles met them, they complimented the Elites on their very round head attire (similar to a coolie hat), with Raphael going so far as saying \\"Nice hats!\\" * The Foot Tech Ninja are warriors with specialized stealth armor that allows them to become seemingly invisible. They also possess greatly enhanced physical speed and strength, but their invisibility is what always gives the Turtles and their allies trouble. * The various video games introduced the Foot Gunners and the sumo-wrestling Mega Foots, although only the Foot Gunners then went on to appear in the TV series as Foot Mechs. * The Foot Clan Technicians have cybernetic enhancements but are rarely ever seen in fights. * The powerful but seldom seen Foot Mystics are five magic-users, each one with powers corresponding to a different natural element: wind, earth, fire, water and metal. In the episode \\"Bad Day\\", it is revealed that the Foot Mystics have Black Magic powers, when they launch an attack against the Turtles on an astral plane. It is also revealed that they obey and serve whoever holds a medallion called the Heart of Tengu. It is also said the Shredder had more respect for their power than Karai, but she repeatedly tells them that as long as she had the medallion, they will obey her with no questions asked. This later leads them to trick Agent Bishop and Baxter Stockman into destroying the Heart, in the episode \\"Good Genes, Part 2\\", allowing them to become free. They then set out to restore the true Shredder. When freed the Mystics were able to revert to their true forms and were shown to be far more powerful than previously shown. Despite their fanatical devotion to the demon Shredder, they were still abused by him for so much as saying anything he felt was out of line. They are eventually killed in \\"Enter the Dragons, Part 1\\", although in the Fast Forward episode \\"The Journal\\" a Foot Mystic appeared before Raphael and Casey Jones and teleported them to a deserted island in one of the pages of Casey and April's journal that the Turtles were reading despite Splinter and Cody's warnings not to read it. However, this particular event was a complete fabrication by Master Splinter and Cody in order to teach the Turtles a lesson. * The Cyber Foot are Foot Soldiers that work for Cyber-Shredder and Master Khan. Their outfits are similar to the Cyber-Shredder's armor. Towards the end of the Ninja Turtles magazine published at the same time as the series, the Foot Mystics are killed by Splinter, when he uses the Sword of Tengu on them. He causes the Fire Mystic to melt the Metal Mystic, the Water Mystic to quench the Fire Mystic, the Earth Mystic to swallow the Water Mystic, the Wind Mystic to scatter the Earth Mystic, and the Metal Mystic is killed by Splinter. However, he is drained by the Sword's power (having not used Leonardo's magic glove). The Foot Clan itself is under the ultimate command of The Utrom Shredder Ch'rell, and his second in command is his adopted daughter Karai. Prior to Karai's appearance, Hun served as Shredder's second and chief enforcer as well as leading the Purple Dragons. But when Karai appeared, she was quickly shown to be higher in Shredder's favor than Hun. After The Shredder was exiled to the ice asteroid belt of Mor Tal in the episode \\"Exodus, Part 2\\", Karai assumed command of the Clan and the mantle of the Shredder giving the Foot Ninja and Foot Elite new designs while Hun evolved the Purple Dragons from a street gang to an organized criminal organization. Somehow after the events of the defeat of the Demon Shredder and the year the Turtles were stuck in the future in Fast Forward, Khan gained control of the Foot, who now dressed in Cyber Foot armor. Under Khan's rule, they were in a gang war against Hun and the Purple Dragons. Once Cyber Shredder appeared, he took control and it was Khan's mission to bring him back into reality. Many believe Khan was once an Elite Foot since his theme is the same theme used whenever the Elite Foot appeared. Khan must have lost control of the Foot after Cyber Shredder's defeat because Karai was in control of the Foot once more in the movie Turtles Forever. At this point, the Utrom Shredder returned by means of his counterpart, the Shredder of the 1987 series. The Technodrome became the headquarters for the Foot Clan of the 2003 series and the robotic foot soldiers were added to the Foot's fighting force after an upgrade with Utrom technology. Using Krang's mutagen reverse-engineered from the mutagen that affected Hun, they also added mutated some of the Cyber Foot where they were classified as Mutant Foot Soldiers and were not seen coming in contact with whatever they mutated into. While two of these mutants resemble Tokka and Rahzar, the rest of the Mutant Foot Soldiers consist of a sea creature-like mutant, a one-eyed mutant, a tiger-like mutant, a mutant with an octopus-shaped head, an insect-like mutant, a bat-like mutant, and some unspecified mutants. The Utrom Shredder kept the 1987 Shredder and Krang on, as well as Bebop and Rocksteady to help lead the Foot. However the Utrom Shredder turned on his counterpart and Krang later in the movie. The Utrom Shredder was eventually destroyed by the Technodrome's weapons. Karai most likely retook control of the Foot at this point. 2012 series In the 2012 series, the Foot Clan's origins are expanded on in the second season of the series. The clan was founded in 512 A.D. in Japan by a master martial artist named Koga Takuza, who used the swords of his fallen foes to forge a helmet stronger than steel, dubbing it the Kuro Kabuto. The Kabuto helmet is a symbol of the leader of the Foot Clan, passed down to the various rulers in the Foot's history. The Foot Clan would end up in a lengthy war against the Hamato Clan, which reached a boiling point when Oroku Saki was raised alongside Hamato Yoshi. Though the two were raised as brothers, Saki discovered his true heritage as being an orphaned Foot Clan member, and when his love Tang Shen wed Yoshi, he inadvertently killed Shen leaving Yoshi to perish while saving his infant daughter Hamato Miwa. Saki rose in the ranks to become the leader of the Foot Clan, tutoring several worthy pupils such as world-famous martial arts star Chris Bradford (who would later be mutated into Dogpound and later Rahzar) and Brazilian street thug Xever Montes (who would later be mutated into Fishface) and sharing business with business partners such as Russian arms dealer Ivan Steranko, Chinese-American Purple Dragons leader Hun, and Italian mafia boss Don Vizioso. In this series, the Foot Clan is a global ninjutsu clan answering only to the Shredder, though others run the various factions of the Foot Clan across the globe. Shredder commanded the Foot from Japan until he learned that Yoshi was training his own ninjas in New York City, and moved his inner clan there with the objective of finding and killing Yoshi and his students. However, Shredder, Karai (a renamed Miwa), Dogpound, Fishface, and their reluctant new conscript, former TCRI inventor Baxter Stockman, fail time and again to do so. Karai learned of the Kraang, an alien race responsible for the mutations of Splinter and the Turtles, who are secretly plotting to conquer and terraform Earth, but Shredder dismisses them until he captures one himself and learns from it that the Turtles guard April O'Neil, whose half-Kraang genetics were need for their invasion. After another failed attempt to kill the Turtles, Shredder allies the Foot Clan with the Kraang, as they share a mutual enemy in the Hamato Clan. In the second season, Shredder left the New York clan under Karai's command, citing urgent business to attend to in Japan. Karai, having been lied to by Shredder to believe that Splinter killed Tang Shen (believing herself to be Saki and Shen's child), uses her new position to aggressively hunt the Hamato Clan until her father's return. Shredder reshuffles the Foot Clan's hierarchy upon his return, installing mutated Japanese mercenary Tiger Claw as his new second-in-command and stripping Karai of the position, though Tiger Claw was briefly trapped in various other dimensions before eventually returning to the fold. Baxter Stockman was later mutated into Stockman-Fly upon his mutagen collar being set off by Shredder for his 74th attempt at making a mutant army for him. However, having been told of her true nature by Splinter and the Turtles, Karai betrayed her father, and when she was brought before him, he admitted that she was Splinter and Tang Shen's biological daughter and imprisons her. The Foot Clan would on one notable occasion be fully mobilized when the Kabuto was stolen by professional thief Anton Zeck on behalf of Steranko. Karai was soon used in a hasty plan to gain vengeance on Splinter by Shredder, resulting in her mutation into a snake-like mutant (though she went back and forth to an additional chemical that Stockman-Fly accidentally added), further strengthening the violent split between the Foot Clan and the Hamato Clan. As a result, Shredder opted to aid the Kraang in their invasion of New York and the Earth, dismissing the likelihood that the Kraang will turn on him. In exchange for their aid in taking New York, Kraang Prime promised to cure Karai of her mutation. The invasion was successful, and though Leonardo defeated the majority of his men in battle, Shredder critically wounded him and was able to finally defeat Splinter, having lost to him on several prior occasions. In the third season, Shredder reveals that they will betray the Kraang and has the entire clan search for Karai before learning that Splinter had survived but lost his memory. It was returned to him by April when she, the Turtles and Casey Jones came to rescue him and she used her physic Kraang powers to bring Splinter to his senses. Shredder later mutated Anton Zeck into Bebop and Ivan Steranko into Rocksteady for Anton's theft of the Kuro Kabuto and Ivan's hunting of Karai. When the two of them tried to attack Shredder in retaliation, Shredder beat them up and told them to either serve him or fall at hand. Ivan and Anton agreed to Shredder's terms‚Äîfor now. Following a fight with the Turtles, Rocksteady and Bebop successfully captured Serpent Karai and brought her to the Shredder. After the Kraang were defeated and driven back to their home dimension by the Turtles and the Mighty Mutanimals, the balance of power over the Manhattan underworld is shifted over to the Foot Clan. This was done for Shredder by gaining control over the Purple Dragon and other Asian gangs through Hun (and possibly Tiger Claw), several South American gangs through Fishface, the Russian Mafia through Rocksteady, and the Italian Mafia through Don Vizioso. By using this power, Shredder had these crime groups aid him with collecting various chemicals from a chemical company called Aumen, an abandoned Kraang lab and Vizioso for a mind control serum that he planned to create and use on the Turtles, the Mutanimals and Karai. The Foot were also served on at least two occasions by a trio of mutants created from the Shredder's DNA and that of several crustaceans, but these were later destroyed after being fused into the so-called \\"Mega Shredder.\\" The Foot later formed an unlikely alliance with Splinter and the Turtles to deal with the threat of the Triceraton's Black Hole Generator, only for Shredder to violate the truce and murder Splinter before he could deactivate the device. As a result, the device went off, and all the Foot Clan members were drawn into the black hole along with the entirety of Earth's population-with the exception of April, Casey, and the Turtles-and the planet itself. Due to the Fugitoid using a device on his ship at the start of the fourth season, time was reset to six months before the Triceraton invasion so that the Turtles, April, and Casey could prevent the Triceratons from assembling the Black Hole Generator. The heroes later teamed with their past selves to save the Earth, during which they were able to alert Splinter to Shredder's murderous intent, leading to a duel between Splinter and Shredder. Splinter achieved victory, but Tiger Claw recovered his master and warned that the Foot Clan would return. Karai started to lead a splintered branch of the Foot Clan with the witch Shinigami which goes into battle against Shredder's branch. Shredder recuperates by taking mutagen which transforms him into Super-Shredder in order to turn the tide against Kara's branch. Super-Shredder managed to kill Splinter. When most of its members are defeated, Super-Shredder is hit by some retro-mutagen which failed to work and is beheaded by Leonardo. In the final season, Tiger Claw started to lead the Foot Clan and their new Foot Cultists into summoning the mystical dragonoid Kavaxas from the Netherworld with a special talisman. After gathering Shredder's helmet and heart from Tatsu's branch and Don Vizioso's group, Tiger Claw had Kavaxas revive Shredder as a sentient zombie. Zombie Shredder started to take Kavaxas as his second-in-command. During the fight against the Foot Clan, Fishface left after explaining the Foot Cultists' origin to the Turtles, a revived Rahzar fell into the Netherworld, and Kavaxas was forcefully dragged back into the Netherworld by Zombie Shredder who states that they belong dead. Afterwards, Tiger Claw calls a truce with the Turtles. The Foot Clan also has a variation in their soldiers: * In the early episodes, the human Foot Ninjas are used. The Foot Soldiers wear black suits and masks. The masks appear to have bug-like eyes and have the Foot Clan logo on it (similar to the outfits worn by the Foot Ninjas from the 1990s films). The Foot Ninjas seem to never talk. Each of the Foot Ninjas fight with staffs, shurikens, katanas, Naginata, Tonfa, and nunchucks. The Foot Ninja recruits are trained at Chris Bradford's dojos. * In Season Two, the Foot Clan gains Foot-Bots that resemble the Foot Ninjas, but are robotic and were created by the Kraang to strengthen the Foot Clan. The Foot-Bots can adapt to every ninja moves and skills. During the Turtles' fight with the Foot Bots, the Turtles had to do unpredictable moves and skills to defeat them. The Foot-Bots later got upgraded with two extra retractable arms with weapons protruding from where the hands would be and with retractable fabric wings that give them gliding abilities. For some unknown reason during that time, the Foot-Bots appeared more than the normal Foot Ninjas. 2018 series In Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the Foot Clan are hired mercenaries. Its known members are the Foot Lieutenant and the Foot Brute. They can make origami ninjas out of paper and have the power of teleportation through hidden gateways. They serve an unknown sensei and are collecting ancient artifacts for some purpose. In the episode \\"The Evil League of Mutants,\\" the Foot Lieutenant and an origami ninja were shown committing a heist which the Turtles couldn't stop. Later on, the Foot Lieutenant and the Foot Brute teleported Baron Draxum away from the Turtles as both sides see that they have a common enemy in them. The episode \\"Shadow of Evil\\" revealed that the Shredder is their master and the Foot were trying to collect pieces of the Kuroi Y≈çroi, Shredder's mystical armor, to revive him. It is also revealed that the Foot uses a shoe store called the Foot Shack as a front for their activities. In \\"Warren and Hypno, Sitting in a Tree,\\" Draxum claimed the gauntlet Warren Stone had that turned out to be part of the Kuroi Y≈çroi for the Foot. In \\"Operation: Normal,\\" the Foot Brute and the Foot Recruit targeted the slime Y≈çkai, Sunita because the boots she was wearing were part of the Kuroi Y≈çroi. They managed to claim them. In \\"How to Make Enemies and Bend People to Your Will,\\" Draxum and the Foot Recruit found out that a Kuroi Y≈çroi fragment was at the botanical gardens. They claimed it after setting up events where the Foot Lieutenant and the Foot Brute would fail. After obtaining the fragment, Draxum declared himself the Foot's leader, via exploiting a loophole in the clan's rulings of leadership. In \\"One Man's Junk,\\" the next piece of the Kuroi Y≈çroi was in the possession of Repo Mantis who claimed it from a Y≈çkai and held in his salvage yard. After trapping the cat/mantis mutant who was owned by Repo Mantis, the Turtles learn from him that two fire-headed guys working as shoe salesmen bought the metal from him. This caused the Turtles to learn that the Foot Lieutenant and the Foot Brute claimed the metal. In \\"End Game,\\" Draxum donned the restored Kuroi Y≈çroi with the intention of destroying humanity once and for all. The Foot Lieutenant and Foot Brute addressed him as Shredder, but he rejected the title, confused with the name \\"Shredder\\". Due to a Jupiter Jim action figure being wedged in a hole in the back of the helmet, the Turtles and April managed to attack that part and caused the armor to fall off of Draxum, though the armor revived itself after siphoning some of Draxum's life force. It is later explained by the Foot Lieutenant that the clan was just manipulating Draxum into donning the Kuroi Y≈çroi so it could drain his life force to reassemble and resurrect the Shredder. In \\"Many Happy Returns,\\" Shredder acted like a feral beast, likely due to the damage the armor received when it was worn by Draxum. After being attacked by the demon, the Foot Lieutenant, Foot Brute, and Foot Recruit retreat to find out what went wrong. In \\"Battle Nexus: New York,\\" the Foot Recruit discovered that Big Mama has been controlling Shredder with a control device and it's associated magic ring. When Big Mama is disarmed of the ring, the Foot Recruit claims it and uses the Shredder to make Big Mama lose everything. As the Shredder destroys the Grand Nexus Hotel, the Foot Recruit can be heard shouting \\"Foot Clan\\" as she flies off on Shredder's back. In the four part \\"Finale\\" episode, more of Shredder's backstory was revealed where Oroku Saki had the Kuroi Y≈çroi forged to be mystical and unstoppable by a hideous Oni. When the Turtles and Splinter head to the Twilight Realm to get a weapon that would beat the Shredder, it also enabled him to regain his power of speech as he leads the Foot Clan into attacking the Turtles. They managed to beat the Turtles and make off with Splinter and Baron Draxum. Using Baron Draxum's laboratory in the Hidden City, Shredder gets the information he needs. A brief fight between Shredder and Baron Draxum collapses part of the laboratory. The cave-in traps the Foot Lieutenant and the Foot Brute as Shredder tells the Foot Recruit to leave them while making her his general. Thanks to information from a recuperating Big Mama, the Turtles and April were able to head to the Crying Titan where Shredder is planning to harness the Empyrean so that he can extract Splinter's essence. With help from a defecting Foot Recruit, the Turtles and April free Splinter and Baron Draxum. The group combines their strengths with the spirits of Splinter's ancestors to defeat the Shredder while reuniting Oroku Saki's spirit with the Hamato Clan's spirits. Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles The Foot Clan appear in the film Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (which is based on the IDW crossover). Sato and Oshi (see above) are mentioned as founders of the Foot Clan. The Foot Clan collaborated with the League of Assassins in a plot that involved using a stolen Wayne Enterprises cloud seeder to spread a compound containing a mixture of mutagen and Joker venom on Gotham City. A select number of Foot Ninjas were mutated into mutant animals where two of them were mutated into a mutant pigeon and a mutant Tyrannosaurus.

All students develop a common core of knowledge in these fields, thereby achieving that sense of shared purpose and reciprocated understanding which is essential to the life of an intellectual community, while at the same time building a strong foundation for later and more specialized work. By completing the Common Curriculum, all students satisfy the requirements for the Certificate of Excellence in undergraduate education awarded by the State Board of Regents. Read on for a more detailed description of the Common Curriculum. Freshman Orientation Scholars' students move into the dorm the week before classes begin, and immediately start Orientation. This class starts with a general convocation ceremony, and then moves on to several sessions on academic survival skills, led by upper-class Scholars' students. These Mentors guide the freshmen through the first few days of college life, providing answers to question, offering advice on College life, and encouraging a sense of community in the freshman class. Computer Applications This course ensures that each student in the College is familiar with the computer resources available to them. Skills taught include familiarity with the College's word processing programs, presentation, and spreadsheet software. In addition, students are assigned an e-mail account and are shown how to access the University's internet packages. Texts and Traditions I‚ÄìIV: The Shaping of Western Thought A central vehicle of the College's commitment to multidisciplinary inquiry, the development of critical thinking skills, and the expression of those skills, Texts and Traditions seminars are a major component of the student's course of study in the first two years. Students move chronologically from antiquity through the twentieth century, studying works by such figures as Homer, Plato, Sappho, Sophocles, Dante, Shakespeare, Galileo, Swift, Austen, Marx, Darwin, Dostoevsky, Conrad, Freud, Woolf, Levi- Strauss, and others. The College recognizes that there is no definitive list of Great Books, and so the reading lists for \\"T 'n T\\" are revised annually. Democratic Vistas: The Idea of America Continuing the concept of the Texts and Traditions seminars, Democratic Vistas explores essential works from the American cultural tradition. This course includes representative texts by such figures as Franklin, Jefferson, Madison, de Tocqueville, Emerson, Hawthorne, Douglass, Whitman, Dickinson, James, Veblen, Faulkner, Morrison, and others, and includes an examination of music, painting, and photography in addition to literary works. As with \\"T 'n T\\", the reading list for \\"DV\\" is revised annually. Paradigms of Nature The several courses arrayed under this heading explore essential elements of mathematics and the natural sciences over four semesters, developing skill in quantitative reasoning and experimental procedure, together with an understanding of the main theoretical postulates of modern science. While addressing important areas of knowledge in Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Ecology, and Mathematics, the Paradigms of Nature courses emphasize the relations between and among these disciplines. The one credit-hour Science Seminar is a special component of our curriculum in which students read, discuss, and analyze works of general interest concerning science topics. Critical Reading, Critical Writing Writing-intensive seminars are offered to first-year students on various topics. These courses are designed to cultivate each student's powers of analysis, debate, and written argument, while engaging important writers, major thinkers, and significant cultural issues. Offerings have included Music and World Cultures, Selfhood and Community, Writing About Film, Southern Fiction, and Interdisciplinary Approaches to Gender. (** needs to be expanded to include topics preceding and following Fall 1997 offerings **) Foreign Language The study of foreign languages is at once an important discipline of mind, a practical necessity in an increasingly interdependent world, and an essential element in the understanding of other cultures. The College offers options in French, German, Spanish, Russian, Greek, and Latin, and requires that students study at least four semesters of the language of their choice. Back to Top =Academic Major= While completing the Common Curriculum, a student may choose to develop a more individualized program in one of the concentrations within the major in Liberal Arts, or may choose to pursue a traditional major. Each student is assisted in this decision making process by an academic advisor within the Scholars' College. The Liberal Arts Major Some students may find that their interests are more broad than those involved in a traditional major, or that the traditional major does not quite suit their educational needs. For these students, Scholars' College offers the Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Arts, along with a Masters of English obtained in only five years, with six areas of concentration. The areas of concentration are: * Fine and Performing Arts * Foreign Languages * Philosophy, Politics, and Law (formerly, History and Philosophy of Science) * Humanities and Social Thought * Scientific Inquiry * Classical Studies The concentration allows the student, with the advice of a faculty member, to develop a cohesive course of study which has a common theme, but which may combine a number of disciplines. These are particularly apt for students who wish to pursue a profession such as a law or medicine, or who plan on attending graduate school. Traditional Majors A student may choose one of sixteen traditional majors which include: * Accounting * Biology * Business Administration * Chemistry * Criminal Justice * Education * Electronic Engineering Technology * English * Fine and Graphic Arts * Health and Exercise Science * History * Industrial Engineering Technology * Music * Political Science * Psychology * Theater * Unified Public Safety Administration These majors are offered within the guidelines established by agreements with departments of NSU. Students must complete all requirements, or their equivalent, for this major as detailed in the NSU catalog, in addition to the Scholars' College Common Curriculum. In some cases, the student will be assigned an advisor within the appropriate NSU department in addition to his or her Scholars' College major advisor. Back to Top =Senior Colloquium and Thesis=Senior Colloquium The Senior Colloquium, which extends over the entire senior year, examines some issue of contemporary concern, chosen collaboratively by the faculty of the College and the junior class. With a common list of important written works serving as points of departure, students in their senior year meet weekly for two hours to attend lectures and presentations by College and University faculty, outside speakers, and students of the class, followed by lively discussion. Topics are chosen on the basis of their significance and contemporary urgency, the disciplinary range they embrace, and the mutual interests of students and faculty. Past topicsTitles for topics 1990‚Äì2005: https://web.archive.org/web/20070620182252/http://www.nsula.edu/scholars/Academics/colloquium.html have included: * Disease and Public Policy (1990‚Äì1991) * Liberty and the First Amendment (1991‚Äì1992) * Environmental Science, Environmental Policy: Local Issues and Global Concerns (1992‚Äì1993) * AIDS: Societal Changes and Cultural Impacts (1993‚Äì1994) (**Need additional confirmation for this title**) * Education for the Twenty-First Century: Needed Improvements (1994‚Äì1995) * Multiculturalism and American Society in the Global Economic Community (1995‚Äì1996) * Mediated Realities: the Media and National Values (1996‚Äì1997) * Crime and Punishment in the Modern World (1997‚Äì1998) * Science and Religion: The Scopes Trial and Its Consequences (1998‚Äì1999) * The Drug Culture: Pharmacology, Economics, and the Law (1999‚Äì2000) * The Nineties: A Critical Retrospective (2000‚Äì2001) * The Sixties (2001‚Äì2002) * Censorship: Who Judges the Judges Themselves?

Though the thesis may vary in length and scope, each is to be a substantial work of scholarship, criticism, scientific research, or artistic execution. The student works with one or more faculty members and demonstrates his or her familiarity with the existing work in his or her field as well as their ability to carry out an extended research project. The thesis is presented to the College at the end of the senior year, and a bound copy is kept in the College's thesis room. Back to Top =Electives= All students complete electives depending on the hours remaining after completing either a major or the concentration. The College recommends that students select electives at the 3000-4000 level, either from the unique offerings of the College, or from other departments in the University. Back to Top Campus Life The Louisiana Scholars‚Äô College Forum Council, the student-led \\"governing\\" body (much like SGA), hosts many food fairs throughout the year; these events invite students and teachers to cook in a shared potluck (very often, the food fairs are themed and have included vegetarian, international food, Halloween, and Christmas food fairs). Scholars' College students are also active in various NSU organizations, including Student Government Association, Student Activities Board, and many sororities and fraternities.

Its present building was designed in the Gothic Revival style by Charles Amos Cummings and Willard T. Sears, completed in 1873, and amplified by the architects Allen & Collens between 1935‚Äì1937. The church, which was built on newly filled land in the Back Bay section of Boston, is located at 645 Boylston Street on Copley Square. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970 for its architectural significance as one of the finest High Victorian Gothic churches in New England. It is home to one of the older religious communities in the United States. History of the congregation Established in 1669, Old South Church is one of the older religious communities in the United States. It was organized by Congregationalist dissenters from Boston's First Church and was known as the Third Church (to distinguish it from the First and Second Congregational Churches in the city). The Third Church's congregation met first in their Cedar Meeting House (1670), then at the Old South Meeting House (1729) at the corner of Washington and Milk Streets in Boston. Christmas Eve services at the church in 2017. Members of the congregation have included Samuel Adams, William Dawes, Benjamin Franklin, Samuel Sewall, and Phillis Wheatley. In 1773, Samuel Adams gave the signals from the Old South Meeting House for the \\"war whoops\\" that started the Boston Tea Party. During the Unitarian Movement of the early 19th century, Old South was the sole Congregational Church in Boston to adhere to the doctrine of Trinitarianism. In 1816 Old South Church joined with Park Street Church to form the City Mission Society, a social justice society to serve Boston's urban poor. During the American Civil War, Old South became a recruiting center for the Union Army under minister Jacob Manning. Though the congregation was not entirely abolitionist, it strongly supported the Union cause. The conclusion of the Civil War was followed by an expansive time of increased inclusion for the congregation. Under minister George Angier Gordon the congregation moved from its meeting house at Washington Street to its Back Bay location in 1875, occupying the present church constructed on newly filled land. Old South's commitment to urban ministry and care continued on into the 20th century becoming a segue for the inclusion of new members increasingly diverse by race, class, and sexual orientation. The congregation has formally adopted a platform of equality, social justice, and peace. Architecture An 1882 engraving of Old South Church showing the first campanile. The church building was designed between 1870 and 1872 by the Boston architectural firm of Cummings and Sears in the Venetian Gothic style. The style follows the precepts of the British cultural theorist and architectural critic John Ruskin (1819‚Äì1900) as outlined in his treatise The Stones of Venice. Old South Church in Boston remains one of the most significant examples of Ruskin's influence on American architecture. The architects, Charles Amos Cummings and Willard T. Sears, also designed the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. The exterior of the church is primarily built of Roxbury Conglomerate commonly called puddingstone. Many arches, and several walls of stone are striped with alternating courses of yellow-beige and deep red sandstone. The porticos and large open arches in the campanile are decorated with simple plate tracery. The upper arches of the porticos are decorated with screens of ornate wrought iron. The building is roofed in alternating bands of red and dark gray slate and the roofline finished with ornamental iron cresting. =Campanile= Basilica of Saint Mark in Venice, Italy. A tall tower, or campanile is the trademark feature of Old South and is visible from several Boston neighborhoods. The tower, on the western end of the church, rises to a height of 246' and houses the church's 2020 pound bell. This is the second campanile built on the same site, designed by Allen & Collens it is similar to the 1875 design in its use of Moorish arches. The first tower, completed in 1875 along with the present Narthex and sanctuary, had begun to list by the late 1920s. The cause was determined to be the faulty footings and piles anchored in the soft former swampland. They were insufficient for the load of the tower. The congregation engaged the architectural firm of Allen & Collens to design a replacement campanile and a new chapel to be named in memory of the Reverend George Angier Gordon. The tower was dismantled, and early 1930s technology of steam shovel and steel pilings provided a lasting solution. Today, the pitch and height of the tower are tested annually and records attest to its enduring stability. The bell wheel, which by motion of a heavy rope swings the large bell, had deteriorated by the late 20th century requiring that the bell be rung by an external hammer. A faithful reconstruction of the original 1931 bell wheel, installed in early fall 2006, returned Old South's bell to \\"full swing.\\" =Lantern= Centered above the Sanctuary on the east side of the church is a copper clad cupola surrounded by twelve ornate gothic arched windows. This feature is reminiscent of the cupolas of the Basilica of St. Mark in Venice. While the lantern provides a striking visual presence it was also built with function in mind. In the days before mechanical fans and air conditioning a series of mechanically operated louvers allowed for window panels to be opened to help cool the sanctuary inside. Decorative arts Main entrance and portico looking northeast. The interior of Old South is exuberant yet quietly modulates the mix of rich materials: highly carved Italian cherry woodwork, limestone, stenciled plaster, and stained glass. The sanctuary is entered from the narthex through a screen carved in the Venetian Gothic style from French Caen limestone. Hidden among the carved foliage that decorates the screen can be found a squirrel, lizard, owl, and snail. A similar theme of animals is also found in the carving of the building's exterior. The interior of the chancel at the east end of the church, behind the choir, is faced by a running screen of wooden arches with quatrefoil lunettes adapted from the upper arcade of the Doge's Palace in Venice. The stained glass windows are by the English stained glass manufacturers Clayton and Bell and were produced in the style of 15th-century English glass. =1875 Cummings and Sears interior= The narthex screen is carved of Caen stone limestone When Old South's church opened in 1875 it looked very much as it does today, based upon the design of Cummings and Sears. The walls were decorated in polychrome stenciling in shades of complex tertiary colors: a rose madder background with overlays of ochre, bay leaf green, warm gray, and persimmon, and highlights of metallic gold. Most of the interior structure, except for the carved wood frieze along the balconies, was already in place by 1875. High above the crossing of the transepts and nave is the lantern, or cupola. The ceiling of the lantern was painted a deep Prussian blue with a pattern of gilded stars to represent the firmament of God. The limestone tracery of the west wall of the sanctuary, with its foliage and animals, combined with the highly carved foliated woodwork and the overhead representation of the nighttime sky was intended to echo God's creation. Above the doors on the east chancel walls are glass mosaics of the tree of life by Antonio Salviati. A third mosaic by Salviati originally hung in the tympanum above the tower's front doors. That mosaic was relocated to the vestibule when the tower was rebuilt 1922-1937. The combined effect was extremely rich; at once a spiritual and sensuous experience, and in great contrast to the chaste interior of Old South Meeting House on Washington Street. Stylistically the 1875 interior was in harmony with the Ruskinian Gothic exterior, and expressed Ruskin's ideal that it is \\"in art that the heart, the head, and the hand of a man come together.\\" =1905 Tiffany interior= In 1905 the congregation engaged Louis Comfort Tiffany to redecorate the sanctuary. Tiffany headed a group of artisans called the Associated Artists who worked largely in a style now described as the Aesthetic Movement. Tiffany was a part of an emerging American view of design in the United States, increasingly taking fewer cues from Europe. Tiffany had decorated Mark Twain's home in Hartford, Connecticut, the state rooms at the White House, and several Back Bay homes. In some ways Tiffany was an expected choice to redecorate Old South. He followed many of the ideas of John Ruskin; he believed in the dignity and importance of the human hand and eye in the decorative arts. Yet Tiffany arrived at Old South at a time when his gilded age style had begun a decline. A new wave of neoclassicism called Beaux-Arts, and the Colonial Revival style were replacing Victorian ornament with a simpler classicism. Theodore Roosevelt's 1902 White House renovation removed all of the Tiffany influence. In Tiffany's redecoration, Old South's stained glass windows were covered by insets of translucent tinted purple glass. The original polychrome stenciled plaster walls were painted purple, then stenciled in a series of geometric patterns with metallic silver paint intended to appear as mother of pearl inlay. Similar to Tiffany's work at Mark Twain's Hartford, Connecticut home, or his design for the White House's Red Room. The resulting work at Old South was a highly ornamented visual experience, unified by a limited color palette. =1950s minimalism= The wooden choir screen of the sanctuary is based on the upper arcade of the Doge's Palace, Venice. In the early 1950s, possibly influenced by the minimalism of the International Style, a second renovation of the Sanctuary took place. The mid-20th-century renovation largely ignored the architectural history of the church. Louis Comfort Tiffany's paint and stenciling was obscured by a coat of light gray paint, and the purple Tiffany glass installed over the stained glass was removed. The oculus of the cupola was closed up. In some ways the removal of decoration recalled the congregation's Puritan roots. =Recognition and restoration= Old South Church's building was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1970. In 1984 a research-driven restoration was begun. The period of the building's construction was adopted, using old photographs and engravings as sources, and paint analysis to replicate original colors, the interior spaces were returned closely to their 1875 appearance. Walls were repainted rose madder and the original Cummings and Sears' stencil patterns were recreated. The cupola was reopened, once more admitting light to the Sanctuary below. Polychrome stenciling repeated the original palette of ochre, bay leaf green, warm gray, and persimmon with metallic gold. Organ The church's present organ, Opus 308, was built in 1921 by E. M. Skinner & Company of Boston for the Municipal Auditorium Theater in St. Paul, Minnesota, and brought to the church in 1985 when that building was demolished. Originally 82 ranks and 5,728 pipes, it now has 115 ranks and 7,625 pipes ranging from to in length. The organ console is located behind the pulpit and is on a hydraulic platform so that it may be raised for concerts and recessed for worship services. The organ's pipes are located behind and to the right and left of the chancel and also at the back of the rear balcony above the entrance to the Sanctuary (32' and chamade). Ten ornately painted wooden pipes are mounted at the front of each side balcony. In December 2008, construction at the adjacent MBTA Copley station created a crack in the church's exterior and damage in the sanctuary. Out of fear that its use might cause further damage, the organ was not used from then until just before Easter in 2009. Bay Psalm Book Old South Church is the owner of one of eleven remaining first-edition copies of the Bay Psalm Book. The Bay Psalm Book, printed in 1640 by Stephen Daye, \\"was the first book printed in the what became the United States.\\"Murray, Stuart A.P. (2012). The Library: An Illustrated History. New York, NY: Skyhorse Publishing p. 140. Until 2013, when one copy was sold at auction to David Rubenstein, Old South Church owned two of the eleven first-edition copies.

Johnson (2009), A Dictionary of Hinduism, Oxford University Press, , Article on VyakaranaJames Lochtefeld (2002), \\"Vyakarana\\" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N-Z, Rosen Publishing, , page 769 This auxiliary discipline has focused on the rules of grammar and linguistic analysis to establish the exact form of words and sentences to properly express ideas. #Nirukta ('): etymology, explanation of words, particularly those that are archaic and have ancient uses with unclear meaning.James Lochtefeld (2002), \\"Nirukta\\" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N-Z, Rosen Publishing, , page 476 This auxiliary discipline has focused on linguistic analysis to help establish the proper meaning of the words, given the context they are used in. #Kalpa ('): ritual instructions. This field focused on standardizing procedures for Vedic rituals, rites of passage rituals associated with major life events such as birth, wedding and death in family, as well as discussing the personal conduct and proper duties of an individual in different stages of his life. #Jyotisha ('): Auspicious time for rituals, astrology and astronomy. This auxiliary Vedic discipline focused on time keeping.James Lochtefeld (2002), \\"Jyotisha\\" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing, , pages 326-327 The character of Vedangas has roots in ancient times, and the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad mentions it as an integral part of the Brahmanas layer of the Vedic texts. These auxiliary disciplines of study arise with the codification of the Vedas in Iron Age India. It is unclear when the list of six Vedangas were first conceptualized. The Vedangas likely developed towards the end of the Vedic period, around or after the middle of the 1st millennium BCE. An early text of the genre is the Nighantu by Yaska, dated to roughly the 5th century BCE. These auxiliary fields of Vedic studies emerged because the language of the Vedic texts composed centuries earlier grew too archaic to the people of that time. Vedangas developed as ancillary studies for the Vedas, but its insights into meters, structure of sound and language, grammar, linguistic analysis and other subjects influenced post-Vedic studies, arts, culture and various schools of Hindu philosophy. The Kalpa Vedanga studies, for example, gave rise to the Dharma-sutras, which later expanded into Dharma-shastras.

A closing argument occurs after the presentation of evidence. A closing argument may not contain any new information and may only use evidence introduced at trial. It is not customary to raise objections during closing arguments, except for egregious behavior.http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/cjm_38.htm However, such objections, when made, can prove critical later in order to preserve appellate issues. In the United States, the plaintiff is generally entitled to open the argument. The defendant usually goes second. The plaintiff or prosecution is usually then permitted a final rebuttal argument. In some jurisdictions, however, this form is condensed, and the prosecution or plaintiff goes second, after the defense, with no rebuttals. Either party may waive their opportunity to present a closing argument. During closing arguments, counsel may not (among other restrictions) vouch for the credibility of witnesses, indicate their personal opinions of the case, comment on the absence of evidence that they themselves have caused to be excluded, or attempt to exhort the jury to irrational, emotional behavior. In some countries (e.g. France or Germany), in criminal cases, the defendant's counsel always makes his closing argument last, after the public prosecutor or any other party. Sometimes the defendant is allowed to address the court directly after his or her counsel's closing argument. In a criminal law case, the prosecution will restate all the evidence which helps prove each element of the offence. In the United States, there are often several limits as to what the prosecution may or may not say, including precluding the prosecution from using a defendant's exercise of his Fifth Amendment right to silence as evidence of guilt.See Cantrell, Charles L., Prosecutorial Misconduct: Recognizing Errors in Closing Argument, 26 Am.

Trial Advoc. 535 (2003) http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1035&context;=charles_cantrell One of the most important restrictions on prosecutors, however, is against shifting the burden of proof, or implying that the defense must put on evidence or somehow prove the innocence of the defendant. In some cases, a judge's presentation of the jury instruction is also known as summing up. In this case, the judge is merely articulating the law and questions of fact upon which the jury is asked to deliberate. The purposes and techniques of closing argument are taught in courses on Trial Advocacy.Lubet, Steven; Modern Trial Advocacy, NITA, New York, NY 2004 pp. 42 et. seq. The closing is often planned early in the trial planning process.Dreier, A.S.; Strategy, Planning & Litigating to Win; Conatus, Boston, MA, 2012, p. 2; The attorneys will integrate the closing with the overall case strategy through either a theme and theory or, with more advanced strategies, a line of effort. The prosecution should also state the main points and be sure to give their side of the argument and to be emotional.O'Toole, Tom (PhD) & Schmid, Jill (PhD); Tsongas Litigation Consulting.

The Model 11-87 remains in contemporary production, years after being introduced in 1987. Design The Model 11-87 is a gas-operated semi-automatic shotgun. Upon firing a shell, some of the high-pressure gases from the burning gunpowder are diverted through two small holes in the underside of the barrel,Remington 11-87 Semi- Automatic Shotgun Review  LearnAboutGuns.com forcing a piston and the bolt toward the buttstock, which in turn ejects the spent shell. A spring then forces the bolt forward, sending a new shell from the magazine into the chamber. This gas operation has the effect of reducing the recoil felt by the shooter, since the total recoil energy is spread out over a longer period of time than would be the case with fixed-breech shotguns. The Model 11-87 incorporates a self-compensating gas system design, which allows the gun to operate with a range of loads, from light shells to Magnum shells, without any adjustment by the operator. It is manufactured in 12 gauge and 20 gauge; both will cycle -inch and 3-inch shells. A lightened version of the Model 11-87, the Model 11-96, was offered in the late 1990s in 12 gauge only. Operation Some Model 11-87 shotguns, especially those with barrels shorter than , or Magnum models, may have issues cycling light target and birdshot loads consistently. A 12 gauge model that accepts shells is marketed as the Super Magnum. This model comes with an extra component on the magazine tube called a \\"barrel seal activator\\" that helps cycle lighter loads. The barrel seal activator is meant to be removed when using -inch or 3-inch shells, and installed when using shorter shells. Some Model 11-87s have interchangeable screw-in chokes; other barrels are available with fixed chokes. Barrels are not interchangeable between the Model 1100 and Model 11-87.

He was a native of the Al-Ahsa region (Eastern Arabian Peninsula), educated in Bahrain and the theological centers of Najaf and Karbala in Iraq. Spending the last twenty years of his life in Iran, he received the protection and patronage of princes of the Qajar dynasty. His ancestors were nomadic Sunnis. Shaykh Ahmad diverged from the Usuli school on key issues related to eschatology, the role of the ulama, and the proper interpretation of the mystical hadith of the Twelve Imams. These divergences resulted in accusations of heresy from orthodox members of the Shia ulama, and instances of persecution against Ahs√°'√≠ and his followers occurred during and after his lifetime. His teachings were complex, thus he often practiced Taqayya concealing his controversial ideas from his opponents. Today, Shaykh√≠ populations retain a minority following in Iran and Iraq. After the death of Shaykh Ahmad's successor, Kazim Rashti, many Shaykh√≠s converted to B√°bism and the Bah√° º√≠ Faith; the two Shaykh√≠ leaders continue to be highly regarded by Bah√° º√≠s, being seen as spiritual forerunners to that religion. History=Early life= Little is documented about the early life of Shaykh Ahmad, except that he was born in al-Ahsa, in the northeast of the Arabian peninsula, to a Shi ªi family of Sunni origin in either the year 1166 AH (1753 CE), or 1157 AH (1744 CE). Nab√≠l's Narrative, a history of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, describes his spiritual awakening as follows: While it is unclear how much of Nabil's interpretation is consistent with Shaykh Ahmad's true feelings, the underlying motivations for reform, and ultimately for messianic expectation, become somewhat clearer. =Education and Mission= Shaykh Ahmad, at about age forty (1784 or 1794 - circa), began to study in earnest in the Shi ªi centres of religious scholarship such as Karbala and Najaf. He attained sufficient recognition in such circles to be declared a mujtahid, an interpreter of Islamic Law. He contended with Sufi and Neo-Platonist scholars, and attained a positive reputation among their detractors. He declared that all knowledge and sciences were contained (in essential form) within the Quran, and that to excel in the sciences, all knowledge must be gleaned from the Quran. To this end he developed systems of interpretation of the Quran and sought to inform himself of all the sciences current in the Muslim world. He also evinced a veneration of the Imams, even beyond the extent of his pious contemporaries and espoused heterodox views on the afterlife, the resurrection and end-times, as well as medicine and cosmology. His views on the soul posited a \\"subtle body\\" separate from, and associated with the physical body, and this also altered his views on the occultation of the Imam Muhammad al-Mahdi. His views resulted in his denunciation by several learned clerics, and he engaged in many debates before moving on to Persia where he settled for a time in the province of Yazd. It was in Yazd that much of his books and letters were written. = Dreams and Visions = He experienced a series of dreams and visions. In one such dream recounted by him, he believed that he was granted permission to transmit knowledge by each of the twelve Imams. In another dream he saw Imam Hasan teaching him Quranic verses. =Founding the Shaykhi School= Juan Cole summarizes the situation at the advent of the Shaykhi School, and the questions that were unfolding as his views crystallized and he acquired an early following: Moojan Momen in his Introduction to Shi ªi Islam (George Ronald, Oxford, 1985) states that many mujtahids were afraid that the Shaykh's preference for intuitive knowledge, which he claimed to obtain directly by inspiration from the Imams, would seriously undermine the authority of their position. Momen has some interesting and useful commentary on Shaykh Ahmad's doctrines and his succession during which the conflict with Shi ªi orthodoxy intensified. Nader Saiedi in his Gate of the Heart (Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 2010) has characterised his followers by their fervent millenarian expectations, their complex mystical and esoteric knowledge, their insistence on the absolute transcendence of the divine Essence, their rejection of the doctrine of wahdatu‚Äôl-wuj√∫d, their reinterpretation of the traditional doctrine of bodily resurrection (ma'ad-i- Jismani), and their ambiguous assertions concerning the necessity of the presence of a living Gate (a B√°b) to the Hidden Im√°m for the guidance of the Sh√≠'i community. Successor Shaykh Ahmad appointed Kazim Rashti as his successor, who led the Shaykh√≠ movement until his death. He taught his students how to recognize the Mahdi and the Masih (the returned Jesus). After his death in 1843, many of his students spread out around Iraq and Iran to search for a new leader. Published works Shaykh Ahmad was a prolific writer, he is known to have completed 71 published works during his career, of which 354 contemporary manuscripts are known to be still extant. Writing primarily in Arabic, his work spanned a wide array of literary forms. The largest number of his works consist of correspondence with other members of the ulama or his students, usually intended to expand upon a teaching advanced in another work, or provide answers to vexing questions of theology or jurisprudence. Treatises and lessons composed independently by al-Ahs√° º√≠ make up a smaller number of his works, but tend to be longer than his correspondence and more commonly studied and reprinted. In keeping with Islamic and Persian literary and academic tradition, a large number of his works take the form of commentaries on Surahs from the Qur ºan, important Hadiths of Muhammad or the Imams, or writing by earlier mystical or theological writers. The most comprehensive bibliography of Ahmad's known works identifies twelve wide subject areas addressed by individual works: ‚Ä¢ Sharh al-Fawa'id. Lithographed. N.P.

It is most famous as the manuscript containing the unique copy of the epic poem Beowulf. In addition to this, it contains first a fragment of The Life of Saint Christopher, then the more complete texts Wonders of the East and Letters of Alexander to Aristotle, and, after Beowulf, a poetic translation of Judith. Due to the fame of Beowulf, the Nowell codex is also sometimes known simply as the Beowulf manuscript. The manuscript is located within the British Library with the rest of the Cotton collection. Name and date The current codex is a composite of at least two manuscripts. The main division is into two totally distinct books which were apparently not bound together until the 17th century. The first of these, originally owned by Southwick Priory in Hampshire, dates from the 12th century and contains four works of prose. It is the second, older manuscript that is more famous. This second manuscript is known as the Nowell codex, after the antiquarian Laurence Nowell, whose name is inscribed on its first page; he was apparently its owner in the mid-16th century. At some point it was combined with the first codex. It was then acquired by Sir Robert Cotton. In his library, it was placed on the first shelf (A) as the 15th manuscript (XV) of the bookcase that had a bust of the Emperor Vitellius, giving the collection its name. The Nowell codex is generally dated around the turn of the first millennium. Recent editions have specified a probable date in the decade after 1000. Condition of the manuscript The Nowell Codex was written in two hands. The first extends from the beginning of the manuscript (fol. 94a) as far as the word scyran in line 1939 of Beowulf; the second hand continues from moste in that same line to the end of Judith. Elliott Van Kirk Dobbie notes that although the scribes behind the two hands are contemporary, they differ markedly in appearance, the second hand appearing \\"to belong to an older school of insular writing than its companion hand.\\"Van Kirk Dobbie, Beowulf and Judith (New York: Columbia University, 1953), p. xvii The volume was heavily damaged in 1731 when a fire partially destroyed the Cotton library. While the volume itself survived, the edges of the pages were badly scorched; no serious attempt at restoration was made until the 19th century, by which time the margins had crumbled irreparably, and the edges of many pages are now illegible. Three pages, fol. 182a, fol. 182b and fol. 201b are in notably bad shape, showing more damage than can be explained by the Cottonian fire, with many words faded or illegible, some of which are far from the edges of the leaf. Van Kirk Dobbie suggests the damage to the third of these pages was due to Beowulf being separated from Judith prior to the 17th century, and fol. 201b was on the outside of the manuscript with no binding to protect it. But he offers no explanation for the condition of the first two pages.Beowulf and Judith, pp. xxf The damage to the Nowell Codex can be overcome to different degrees. The three pages in bad shape mentioned above have been studied under ultraviolet light, and the resulting information has been published.Beowulf and Judith, p. xx Three modern transcriptions of parts of this portion of this manuscript are known. Two of these transcriptions, known as A and B, were made under the direction of the first editor of Beowulf, Grimur Jonsson Thorkelin in the years 1786-1787 after the Cottonian fire yet before the manuscript had deteriorated as far as it presently has. Transcript A was made by an unidentified professional copyist, while B was made by Thorkelin himself.Beowulf and Judith, pp. xxf The third transcript (MS Junius 105, currently in the Bodleian Library) is of the Judith poem and was made by Franciscus Junius between 1621 and 1651. A careful copy of the poem with only occasional errors, Junius' transcription preserves the text of the poem before it suffered fire damage.Beowulf and Judith, pp. xxiif Contents=First codex = The first codex contains four works of Old English prose: a copy of Alfred's translation of Augustine's Soliloquies, a translation of the Gospel of Nicodemus, the prose Solomon and Saturn, and a fragment of a life of Saint Quentin. =Second codex= The second codex begins with three prose works: a life of Saint Christopher, Wonders of the East (a description of various far- off lands and their fantastic inhabitants), and a translation of a Letter of Alexander to Aristotle. These are followed by Beowulf, which takes up the bulk of the volume, and Judith, a poetic retelling of part of the book of Judith. Great wear on the final page of Beowulf and other manuscript factors such as wormhole patterns indicate Judith was not originally the last part of the manuscript, though it is in the same hand as the later parts of Beowulf. The somewhat eclectic contents of this codex have led to much critical debate over why these particular works were chosen for inclusion. One theory which has gained considerable currency is that the compiler(s) saw a thematic link: all five works deal to some extent with monsters or monstrous behaviour.

Early life and education Saunders was born near Milton, Caswell County, North Carolina, the son of William and Hannah Mitchell Saunders. His mother died when Romulus was an infant, and his father subsequently moved him to Sumner County, Tennessee. Following his father's death in 1803, uncle James Saunders became legal guardian and brought Romulus back to Caswell County to attend Hyco and Caswell Academies. In 1809, Saunders enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He was expelled in March 1810 for firing a pistol on campus and throwing \\"a stone at the Faculty\\". Nine years later, Saunders would be elected to the university's board of trustees, where he served for forty-five years. Career=Early career= After his expulsion, Saunders moved to Tennessee and read law under future Senator Hugh Lawson White. He was admitted to the bar in Nashville in 1812, and returned to Caswell County the same year. In 1815, he was elected to the North Carolina House of Commons and soon after the North Carolina Senate. In 1818 he returned to the House, and served as Speaker of the House from 1819 to 1820. =U.S. House of Representatives= Saunders was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1820. As congressman, Saunders was known for his unabashed pro-states' rights opinions. Saunders was such a staunch support of William H. Crawford's presidential campaign in the 1824 election that the eventual winner John Quincy Adams referred to the congressman as the most \\"cankered or venomous reptile in the country\\".Cooper, William J. The Lost Founding Father: John Quincy Adams and the Transformation of American Politics (Liveright Publishing Corporation, 2017). As an admirer of Nathaniel Macon, Saunders was a fiscal conservative, believing that \\"men in power are apt to think the peoples' money is intended to be expended in such way as their distempered fancy may support\\".Dictionary of North Carolina Biography: Vol. 5, P-S (The University of North Carolina Press, 1994). Despite this, Saunders supported internal improvements such as roads and railroads projects. =State government= In 1828, Saunders left Congress to become North Carolina Attorney General. He left the post in 1834 after receiving a presidential appointment on the French spoliations claims commission. The state legislature appointed Saunders to the North Carolina Superior Court in 1835 - an office he held until 1840 when he became the Democratic nominee for Governor of North Carolina. After a contentious campaign, Saunders was defeated by Whig nominee John Motley Morehead. During his time in state government, the North Carolina Democratic Party split into two factions. Saunders led the states' rights faction, which believed in the ideas of John C. Calhoun. The more moderate wing was led by Bedford Brown, a fellow Caswell native and political enemy to Saunders. When Democrats gained control of the state legislature in 1842, both Brown and Saunders ran for the U.S. Senate seat. Neither man received a majority of votes, and the seat went to William Henry Haywood Jr.. =Return to Congress= Saunders returned to Congress following his election in 1840, where he became an outspoken opponent of Martin Van Buren and his allies who opposed the annexation of Texas. At the 1844 Democratic National Convention, Saunders sponsored a resolution requiring a two-thirds vote for the selection of a presidential candidate. This paved the way for the nomination of James K. Polk. =Minister to Spain= Perhaps as an act of appreciation for helping him win the Democratic presidential nomination, President Polk appointed Saunders as minister plenipotentiary to Spain in 1846. As minister, Saunders negotiated a secret agreement in which Spain offered to sell Cuba to the United States. The media leaked this agreement, causing negotiations to falter. Saunders resigned from his post in 1849. =Return to state government= Saunders moved to Raleigh, North Carolina, and in 1850 was elected to represent Wake County in the House of Commons. As representative, Saunders became a supporter of constructing the North Carolina Railroad. Saunders again attempted to be appointed to the U.S. Senate in 1852. The legislature could not agree on whom to appoint, and the seat remained open until the appointment of David Settle Reid in 1854. The legislature did, however, reappoint Saunders to the Superior Court. Personal life Saunders married Rebecca Peine Carter on December 27, 1812. The marriage produced five children: James, Franklin, Camillus, Anne Peine, and Rebecca. Rebecca later died, and Saunders married Anne Heyes Johnson (the daughter of William Johnson) on May 26, 1823. The couple had at least four children: William Johnson, Margaret Madeline, Jane Claudia, and Julia A. Around 1831, the Saunders family purchased the Elmwood estate in Raleigh ‚Äì the former home of John Louis Taylor. Saunders died there on April 21, 1867, and was buried in the Old City Cemetery.

The valley's first inhabitants grew crops at the mountain's base, along the Santa Cruz River. The name \\"Tucson\\" is derived from the O'odham Cuk ·π¢on , meaning \\"[at the] base of the black [hill]\\". In the 1910s, University of Arizona students used local basalt rock to construct a 160-ft-tall (49 m) block \\"A\\" on the mountain's east face, near its summit, giving the peak its other name, \\"A\\" Mountain. The peak is part of a 272-acre (110 hectares) park, the largest natural resource park in the City of Tucson. Early history The fertile land at the base of Sentinel Peak was used for agriculture from circa 2000 BCE until the 1930s. Bedrock mortars found on the sides of the peak are believed to have been used to grind corn and mesquite beans into flour. In the 1690s, the O'odham people living in the area were visited by Father Eusebio Francisco Kino, who established the nearby Mission San Xavier del Bac. After Presidio San Augustin del Tucson was constructed in 1775, sentinels were stationed on the peak to watch for raiding Apaches. Geology Sentinel Peak is made up of several layers of igneous rock representing various types of volcanic activity, though the mountain itself is not a volcano. It is one of a cluster of outcroppings at the eastern edge of the Tucson Mountains that are primarily the remnants of 20-30 million-year-old (Ma) lava flows that once extended west towards the Tucson Mountains and east into the Tucson Basin, where the city is now. Erosion and faulting are responsible for the peak's conical shape. The layer of rock at the peak of the hill is a basaltic andesite dating to 23-24 Ma. This caps a 30-36 meter-thick layer of tuff (compacted volcanic ash) above another layer of basaltic andesite, both dating to 26-28 Ma. Tuffs and andesite exposed at the base of the hill, on the south side, date to approximately 60 Ma. Volcanic ash and breccia, along with ancient lava beds, or lahars, can also be found on the mountain, further evidence of a once active volcanic field that formed the Tucson Mountain range. Etymology On October 3, 2016, in the Arizona Daily Star newspaper, historian David Leighton explained the origin of the name Sentinel Peak: He wrote that in the very early days of Tucson, an Indian fortification was constructed at the top of a small mountain that would come to be called Sentinel Peak---also sometimes referred to as Picket Post Butte. This Indian fortification in time became known as the sentinel station because a sentinel or guard was posted there to watch for approaching enemies, likely Apache Indians. During the U.S. Civil War, armed guards or soldiers were posted at the sentinel station and a canvas was stretched across the stone fortification, to keep the sun from hitting directly on the men posted there. By 1883, remains of the fortification are what existed at that point. The remains included, \\"A circular wall, about 3 feet thick and made of boulders, [that] enclosed an area about 8 feet in diameter. North of the circular structure was a small wall, roughly two feet high and about 10 feet long. To the east were traces of another, smaller circular wall.\\" In 1925, the remains of the fortifications still existed at the top of what by then was being called \\"A\\" Mountain although it is unknown what exactly was left at that point. The origin of the name Sentinel Peak, according to Mr. Leighton, \\"comes from the sentinel station and the sentinel stationed there.\\" David Leighton, \\"Street Smarts: Tale of road up \\"A\\" Mountain includes murder, adultery, and dirty deals,\\" Arizona Daily Star, Oct. 3, 2016 The \\"A\\" After Arizona football's 7‚Äì6 victory over Pomona in 1914, a civil engineering student on the team convinced one of his professors to make a class project of the survey and design for a huge block \\"A\\" on Sentinel Peak. Students carried the project to completion on March 4, 1916, when the 70 ft (21 m) wide, 160 ft (48 m) tall \\"A\\" was whitewashed on the east side of the peak. The basalt rock used in the construction of the \\"A\\" was hauled from a quarry at the mountain's base which supplied stone for many foundations and walls throughout Tucson, including the wall surrounding the University of Arizona campus. The \\"A\\" has traditionally been painted white. On March 23, 2003, four days after the start of the Iraq War, it was painted black in protest. Two weeks later, following much public debate, the Tucson City Council resolved to have the \\"A\\" painted red, white, and blue in honor of American troops. A decade later the council decided to restore it to its traditional white. The \\"A\\" has on occasion been painted green for St. Patrick's Day. Arizona State University has a more recently created \\"A\\" Mountain (Tempe Butte) near the school's football stadium. During the week of the Arizona-ASU Territorial Cup game, rival fans and students have tried and at times succeeded in painting the \\"A\\" of the opposing school with their own school colors.

There are two categories of asepsis: medical and surgical. The modern day notion of asepsis is derived from the older antiseptic techniques, a shift initiated by different individuals in the 19th century who introduced practices such as the sterilizing of surgical tools and the wearing of surgical gloves during operations. The goal of asepsis is to eliminate infection, not to achieve sterility. Ideally, a surgical field is sterile, meaning it is free of all biological contaminants (e.g. fungi, bacteria, viruses), not just those that can cause disease, putrefaction, or fermentation. Even in an aseptic state, a condition of sterile inflammation may develop. The term often refers to those practices used to promote or induce asepsis in an operative field of surgery or medicine to prevent infection. History The modern concept of asepsis evolved in the 19th century through multiple individuals. Ignaz Semmelweis showed that hand washing prior to delivery reduced puerperal fever. Despite this, many hospitals continued to practice surgery in unsanitary conditions, with some surgeons taking pride in their bloodstained operating gowns. It was not until after reading of the findings by Louis Pasteur that Joseph Lister introduced the use of carbolic acid as an antiseptic, and in doing so, reduced surgical infection rates. Lawson Tait shifted the movement then from antisepsis to asepsis, instilling practices such as a strict no-talking policy within his operating room and drastically limiting the number of people to come in contact with a patient's wound. Ernst von Bergmann also introduced the autoclave, a device used for the practice of the sterilization of surgical instruments. Image of William Stewart Halsted But, everything from operating room uniforms to gloves was pioneered by William Halsted. Preceding modern-day scrubs attire, Halsted implemented a no street clothes policy in his operating room, opting to wear a completely white, sterile uniform consisting of a duck suit, tennis shoes, and skullcap. This helped to prevent the introduction of infections into open wounds. Additionally, Halsted would sterilize the operation site with alcohol, iodine and other disinfectants and use drapes to cover all areas except for the site. In his department at Johns Hopkins Hospital, he enforced an extreme hand washing ritual consisting of soaking in harmfully strong chemicals like permanganate and mercury bichloride solution as well as scrubbing with stiff brushes. The damage to a surgical nurse's hands compelled him to create the earliest form of the surgical gloves with the Goodyear Rubber Company. These gloves became a part of the aseptic surgery standard when Dr. Joseph Colt Bloodgood and several others began wearing them for that particular purpose. = Antisepsis vs. Asepsis = The line between antisepsis and asepsis is interpreted differently, depending on context and time. In the past, antiseptic operations occurred in people's homes or in operating theaters before a large crowd. Procedures for implementing antisepsis varied among physicians and experienced constant changes. Until the late 19th century, physicians rejected the connection between Louis Pasteur's germ theory that bacteria caused diseases and antiseptic techniques. At the end of the 19th century, Joseph Lister and his followers expanded the term \\"antisepsis\\" and coined \\"asepsis,\\" with the justification that Lister had initially \\"suggested excluding septic agents from the wound from the start.\\" Generally, however, asepsis is seen as a continuation of antisepsis since many of the values are the same, such as a \\"germ-free environment around the wound or patient,\\" and techniques pioneered under both names are used in conjunction today. Method Asepsis refers to any procedure that is performed under sterile conditions. This includes medical and laboratory techniques (such as with bacterial cultures). There are two types of asepsis - medical and surgical. Medical or clean asepsis reduces the number of organisms and prevents their spread; surgical or sterile asepsis includes procedures to eliminate micro-organisms from an area and is practiced by surgical technologists and nurses. Ultimately, though, successful usage of aseptic operations depends on a combination of preparatory actions. For example, sterile equipment and fluids are used during invasive medical and nursing procedures. The largest manifestation of such aseptic techniques is in hospital operating theaters, where the aim is to keep patients free from hospital micro-organisms. Packaged, sterilized surgical instruments While all members of the surgical team should demonstrate good aseptic technique, it is the role of the scrub nurse or surgical technologist to set up and maintain the sterile field. To prevent cross-contamination of patients, instruments are sterilized through autoclaving or by using disposable equipment; suture material or xenografts also need to be sterilized beforehand. Basic aseptic procedures includes hand washing, donning protective gloves, masks and gowns, and sterilizing equipment and linens. Medical aseptic techniques also includes curbing the spread of infectious diseases through quarantine, specifically isolation procedures based on the mode of disease transmission. Within contact, droplet and airborne isolation methods, two different procedures emerge: strict isolation vs. reverse isolation. Strict isolation quarantines patients to prevent them from infecting others, while reverse isolation prevents vulnerable patients from becoming infected.  Related Infections  In aseptic conditions, a \\"chronic low-level inflammation\\" known as sterile inflammation may develop as a result of trauma, stress, or environmental factors. As in infections caused by pathogens or microbes, the immune response is regulated by host receptors. Tissue damage resulting from non-infectious means are caused by DAMPs molecules released after injury or cell death has occurred, which are able to stimulate inflammation response. Diseases associated with sterile inflammation include Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis, as well as cancer tumor growth due to \\"immune cell infiltration.\\" Additionally, aseptic tissue damage may arise from corticosteroid injections, which are drugs used to treat musculoskeletal conditions such as carpal tunnel and osteoarthritis, though this tends to result from improper aseptic technique. Medical illustration of Staphylococcus Despite efforts to preserve asepsis during surgery, there still persists a 1-3% chance of a surgical site infection (SSI). Infections are categorized as superficial incisional, deep incisional, or organ; the first type are confined to the skin, the second to muscles and nearby tissues, and the third to organs not anatomically close to the operation site. The exact modes of infection depend on the types of surgery, but the most common bacteria that are responsible for SSIs are Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus spp. The CDC emphasizes the importance of both antiseptic and aseptic approaches in avoiding SSIs, especially since Staphylococcus aureus, among other bacteria, are able to evolve drug-resistant strains that can be difficult to treat. In 2017, nearly 20,000 patients in the United States died from Staphylococcus aureus in comparison to the 16,350 from diagnosed HIV.

It was founded by Giovanni Gualberto, a Florentine noble, in 1038 and became the mother house of the Vallumbrosan Order. It was extended around 1450, reaching its current aspect at the end of the 15th century. In 1529, after the looting of Charles V, the east tower was built, in the 17th century followed the wall and in the 18th century the fishing ponds. Today, the monastery is open for tourists and is selling local produce. On 7 October 1096, Pope Urban II addressed the congregation of Vallombrosa, imploring the religious amongst them to support the cause for a crusade to the Holy Land. In particular in this sermon, he cited the need for knights, who could \\"restore the Christians to their former freedom\\".1 Largely because of his poetic reference to the \\"autumnal leaves that strow the brooks, in Vallombrosa\\" in Paradise Lost, John Milton is supposed to have visited the monastery and, according to a plaque erected during the Fascist era, actually stayed there. Though this is unlikely, the notion that he did so encouraged many later travelers to visit the place, including William Beckford, J. R. Cozens, William Wordsworth, Crabb Robinson, Frances Trollope, Mary Shelley, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and Friederich Nietzsche. The Anglo-Italian monk, Enrico Hugford, became Abbot of Vallombrosa in 1743 and fellow Catholic, John Talman, seems to have visited even earlier. Derek Walcott also mentions Vallombrosa in chapter 33 section 2 of his Omeros. Derek Walcott has allusions to several historical moments and other literary works throughout the Omeros, and Shmoop suggests that this reference was inspired by John Milton. Partly thanks to the influence of the pioneering American ecologist and author of the 1864 Man and Nature, George Perkins Marsh, the Istituto Superiore Forestale Nazionale was founded in the secularized monastery in 1867. The exterior The exterior retains the 12th century belltower and a 15th-century tower. It maintains a sobriety appropriate for a monastery. It is a walled precinct, accessed through an 18th-century gate. The facade was designed (1637) by Gherardo Silvani who completed designs by Alfonso Parigi; Silvani also completed the facade of the church (1644). The church interior The interior of the church was frescoed (1779‚Äì1781) by G. A. Fabbrini. The main altar has an Assumption by the Volterrano, The altar of the left transept has a Trinity by Lorenzo Lippi; other altarpieces are by Agostino Veracini, Antonio Puglieschi, Niccol√≤ Lapi. In the Baptistery (once chapel of the Converted) is a Conversion of Saul by Cesare Dandini and in the chapel of San Giovanni Gualberto, a fresco by Alessandro Gherardini, the scagliola altar was Ignazio Hugford, a canvas by Antonio Franchi. Offertories before this altar were made by members of the Forest Service who have San Giovanni Gualberto as their patron saint. The wooden choir to the right of the main altar was fashioned by Francesco da Poggibonsi (1444‚Äì1446); the reliquary has the arm of the saint who founded the Vallombrosan order by Paolo Sogliano (1500). The sacristy has an altarpiece by Raffaellino del Garbo depicting San Giovanni Gualberto and other saints (1508), and a great terracotta altarpiece from the studio of Andrea della Robbia; the refectory has a series of canvases by Ignazio Hugford (1745); the antirefectory has a large painting by Santi Buglioni and a cycle of paintings (three tryptichs) by Mario Francesconi.Obtained from Italian Wikipedia See also Arboreti di Vallombrosa References * * Chaney, Edward, 'Milton's Visit to Vallombrosa: A Literary Tradition', The Evolution of the Grand Tour: Anglo-Italian Cultural Relations since the Renaissance, 2nd ed.

Additionally the Sierrita Mountains lie due south, the Roskruge Mountains lie to the west across Avra Valley, the Silver Bell Mountains lie to the northwest, and the Tortolita Mountains lie to the north across the Santa Cruz Valley.Silver Bell Mountains, Arizona, 30x60 Minute Topographic Quadrangle, USGS, 1994 Parks and preserves The Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum is located on the west flank of the Tucson Mountains. Much of the range is protected by Saguaro National Park and Tucson Mountain County Park. Old Tucson Studios are located just west of the Tucson Mountains. Tucson Mountain Park was established April 1929. The Pima County Parks Commission, with C. B. Brown as its chairman, was established to oversee the park. At approximately , the park is one of the largest natural resource areas owned and managed by a local government in the U.S. The park has approximately of non-motorized shared-use trails. The area is popular with hikers, mountain bikers, and equestrians. Saguaro National Park was created as a National Monument in 1933 and later designated a national park in 1994. The Tucson Mountain District of Saguaro National Park ranges from an elevation of 2,180 ft to 4,687 ft and contains 2 biotic communities, desert scrub, and desert grassland. Average annual precipitation is approximately 10.27 in. Common wildlife include the coyote, Gambel's quail, and desert tortoise.

These birds are commonly known as thornbills. They are not closely related to species in the hummingbird genera Chalcostigma and Ramphomicron, which are also called thornbills. They are found primarily in Australia and have a thin long beak. Colloquially the thornbill is sometimes referred to as a ‚Äútit‚Äù by locals, but in reality the Australian continent lacks any true tits, albeit Acanthiza species do show some similarities with tits in their behavior. They have a similar role as small insect-eating birds with titmice and kinglets. Like tits, Thornbills live in small groups foraging amidst trees and shrubs, and feed in a similar manner. Cooperative breeding is recorded from most species except the brown and Tasmanian thornbills.Higging, P.J. and J.M. Peter; Handbook of Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic Birds, vol. 6: Pardalotes to Shrike-thrushes. The habitat preferences of the group vary from dense forest to open saltbush and bluebush plains. Acanthiza follow a very characteristic undulating path when flying. Their diet is formed essentially of little insects and plant lice that these birds glean from foliage. They are also exceptional acrobats that are easily able to stay head downward like tits do. The nest of the Acanthiza is a large dome-shaped construction, completely enclosed except for a side hole, just like that of the long-tailed tit; however Acanthiza adds to it an additional room whose function is unknown. It is somewhat similar to the Aegithalidae in combining long incubation periods with highly synchronous hatching.Ricklefs, R.E.; ‚ÄúSibling competition, hatching asynchrony, incubation period, and lifespan in altricial birds‚Äù; in Power, Dennis M.

It aired from January 1995 to November 2019 in Adelaide and Perth. Editions in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne were previously produced before being cancelled in February 2014. History Following the cancellation of Real Life, presented by Stan Grant late in 1994, Today Tonight was launched in January 1995 to replace it, with separate editions for each main metropolitan market (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth). Over summer, it was usual for Today Tonight to present a single edition broadcast across the entire east coast of Australia (that is, combining Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane). = South Australia = The South Australian edition was anchored by Rosanna Mangiarelli. Since the program's inception in South Australia in 1995 until 2007, Leigh McClusky fronted the South Australian edition of the program, only taking leave over summer and to give birth to her son in 2002 (John Riddell filled in) and to have a daughter in 2006 (Rosanna Mangiarelli filled in). When the program first started, it rated 100,000 behind its competitor, A Current Affair, although ratings steadily increased. In 2001, Today Tonight began outrating A Current Affair in what became a 4-year winning streak. McClusky announced on 6 February 2007, she would leave the programme to have twins, and would not return. She presented her last show on 17 August 2007. Rosanna Mangiarelli began as presenter on 20 August 2007 after several years as substitute presenter. On 1 October 2007, the South Australian edition of the program began airing in regional South Australia, after WIN Television changed their affiliation in the state from the Nine Network to the Seven Network. Mangiarelli was away on maternity leave from January 2009 till March 2009, and Paul Makin presented during this period. The South Australian edition does not air on the Seven Network's affiliated station, Southern Cross Television, in the Spencer Gulf or Broken Hill, which uses its 6:30pm timeslot for its local bulletin in the area. The Adelaide edition of Today Tonight achieved the longest winning streak for a television program since the introduction of the current OzTAM ratings system in 2001, reaching 700 consecutive weeks of winning its timeslot between March 2001 and September 2018. On 26 November 2019, it was announced that Seven had axed the remaining Adelaide and Perth editions of the show, to be replaced with a one-hour bulletin of Seven News. The final Adelaide bulletin was aired on 28 November 2019. =Western Australia= The Western Australian edition was anchored by Monika Kos. The show was originally presented by Yvette Mooney. In 1997, Mooney resigned and was replaced by Kos, who continued right up until the show's cancellation in November 2019. The fill-ins for the Western Australian edition were Tina Altieri or Andrea Burns. The final Perth bulletin aired on 29 November 2019. = New South Wales & Victoria = The New South Wales edition was originally hosted by a myriad of hosts from 1995 until 2001. Neil Mercer initially hosted the Sydney edition, later succeeded by Helen Wellings (1996). Jill Singer originally hosted the Victorian edition, she remained as host until January 1997 when she was replaced by Naomi Robson and Peter Luck (1997‚Äì1998) following health issues. Stan Grant, ex host of Today Tonight- predecessor Real Life, returned in 1999 following the departure of Luck. Grant was sacked in 2000 after it was exposed he was having an affair with another then Seven Network personality, Tracey Holmes, and was subsequently replaced by Melissa Doyle. When Doyle went on maternity leave in 2001, the Victorian edition hosted by Robson began to be broadcast into Sydney. This was intended to last only 12 weeks, but the Victorian version rated higher in Sydney than the local version. This led to Seven Network executives axing the New South Wales edition in favour of an east coast edition. Doyle returned at the end of 2002 to host the summer edition. Robson continued to host Today Tonight until she resigned in late 2006, presenting her last show on 1 December that year. Anna Coren was appointed Robson's permanent replacement after six weeks of filling in as the show's summer host. With Coren taking the chair, production of Today Tonight shifted from Seven's Melbourne studios to the Martin Place studio in Sydney. On 28 September 2008, Coren resigned to pursue a career at CNN in Hong Kong. It was originally planned that Coren would continue as host until December 2008, but she was sacked by Seven and hosted her last show on 10 October 2008, to be replaced by new host Matt White. White hosted the show until November 2012. On 11 February 2013, Helen Kapalos commenced as anchor, and production was moved back to Melbourne where Kapalos was based. In January 2014, Helen Kapalos resigned as host to join Sunday Night as a senior correspondent. Kylie Gillies and Nick Etchells were the fill-in hosts for the show, until it was announced on 3 February 2014 that the east coast edition of Today Tonight would be axed in favour of a one-hour Seven News bulletin. =Queensland= The Queensland edition, while unrelated to an earlier series of the same name which aired on QTQ from 1979 to 1985, was fronted by three different presenters in the course of its 7‚Äì8-year run, with Lexy Hamilton- Smith and Michelle Reiken presenting after Tucker. On 9 December 2002, Michelle Reiken went on maternity leave over the summer non-ratings period. During this time, the Melbourne/Sydney edition was broadcast into Brisbane. When the 2003 ratings period commenced, Seven Brisbane continued to air the Melbourne/Sydney edition instead of returning to a local version. Although the Seven Network announced a local edition would return when Reiken returned from maternity leave, this never happened. In May 2003, Seven Brisbane officially axed its local version. In 2013, the Queensland edition was relaunched, with Sharyn Ghidella as anchor. On 3 February 2014, however, the Seven Network announced the Queensland edition would be axed again, in favour of a one-hour Seven News bulletin. Achievement Today Tonight nationally was the last program to win the Logie for Most Popular Public Affairs Program before that award was discontinued. Criticism Today Tonight was notorious for its sensationalist reporting, and was an example of tabloid television where stories rotated around controversial issues such as diet fads, miracle cures, welfare cheats, shonky builders, negligent doctors, poorly run businesses and corrupt government officials. For this reason the program was constantly ridiculed and criticised, perhaps most famously by ABC TV's Media Watch and the satirical group The Chaser. Today Tonight was also been found multiple times to be in breach of the Australian Communications and Media Authority's (ACMA) policies with regard to invasions of privacy and not presenting factual material accurately. =Christopher Skase controversy= In November 1996, Media Watch revealed that Today Tonight had fabricated much of a report about disgraced Australian businessman Christopher Skase. Today Tonight sent producer Chris Adams and reporter David Richardson, along with a camera crew, to pursue Skase, who was claiming his health prevented him from being tried. Richardson alleged that because the crew's videotapes showed Skase was in good health, he used his connections to the Majorcan authorities in order to establish police roadblocks to seize the tapes. The only support for this claim was a video of Richardson driving past police, exclaiming, \\"Roadblocks! Let's get out of here!\\" Media Watch proved, through examination the Today Tonight footage, that it was in fact shot in Barcelona, not Majorca. The \\"police\\" Richardson was passing were in fact the Gu√†rdia Urbana de Barcelona setting up roadblocks to control traffic flow in the city centre. =Dole Army hoax= On 4 February 2002, both Today Tonight and A Current Affair broadcast stories about a so-called \\"Dole Army\\" operating from Melbourne's subterranean stormwater drains, and recruiting for an organised effort to defraud the Australian government of unemployment benefits. The next day, an anarchist group claimed they had pretended to be the Dole Army as a hoax, and due to lack of research and a desire to vilify the unemployed, both Today Tonight and ACA fell for the elaborate prank. =Contempt of court allegations= In 2004, Today Tonight picked up on a story published in Melbourne's Sunday Herald Sun about a boy allegedly \\"divorcing\\" his mother. The story was subsequently discussed on Seven's breakfast television program Sunrise. The following year, journalists, editors and producers from all three media outlets were taken to the Sydney Magistrates Court for breaching the Children and Young Persons Act 1989 by naming the child in question. Naomi Robson was found not guilty of contempt of court, as the magistrate found she did not have editorial control over the story, but producers of the show were fined. =The \\"Serial Single Mum\\" controversy= On 18 July 2005, Today Tonight screened a report by Richardson about \\"Australia's Serial Single Mum,\\" claiming that a single mother named \\"Mary-Anne\\", a private citizen in suburban Sydney, \\"had five children to five different men and pocketed tens of thousands in welfare\\" from Centrelink. It was later revealed by Media Watch that Mary-Anne was working full-time and had the children to four fathers, not five. Media Watch described the exchange between Richardson and Mary-Anne as an \\"appalling attack\\", and \\"another offensive beat up from Dave 'Sluggo' Richardson\\". =The \\"Wa-Wa\\" controversy= On 13 September 2006, Robson and a Today Tonight crew were detained by Indonesian authorities in Papua for working as journalists despite entering the country on tourist visas. Seven claimed its team was sent to the region to do a story on Wa-Wa, a young boy who was apparently in danger of being ritually killed and eaten by his tribe, the Korowai. Seven also claimed their rivals at Nine, who had previously aired a story about Wa-Wa on 60 Minutes, sabotaged the story and the mission to \\"rescue\\" Wa-Wa by informing Indonesian authorities of their visa arrangements. Nine refuted Seven's claims and threatened legal action. Seven alleged a Nine reporter offered about $100,000 to a guide not to help Seven with their story. Peter Meakin, Seven's director of news and current affairs, said, \\"There is evidence to support the claims that, in particular, this man Cornelius was offered $100,000 not to rescue the boy.\\" =Defamation of Mark McGaw= On 2 November 2006, the Supreme Court of New South Wales awarded A$385,000 to former Gladiator and rugby league star Mark McGaw for a defamatory story Today Tonight broadcast in June 2003. The Supreme Court jury found the story conveyed two defamatory imputations: that McGaw was \\"a man of dangerous domestic violence\\", and that he \\"bashed his lover so severely she was hospitalised with horrific injuries\\". =Chain stunt= On 20 February 2007, the east coast edition of Today Tonight led with a story about Shirley Frey, an 84-year-old resident of a nursing home in Willoughby who was fighting attempts to evict her. The story featured footage of her chained in her room. The reporter, Nicolas Boot, said she was \\"refusing to budge, chaining herself to her room\\". In response to the airing of that story, officials with the Department of Health and Ageing visited the nursing home. According to a spokesman for Minister for Ageing Santo Santoro, the resident told them the chains had been brought by the Today Tonight crew, and the process of chaining her up had been instigated by the program. In response to this incident, presenter Anna Coren was forced to read an apology to viewers on the next night's broadcast, and announced Seven had launched an internal investigation. Earlier that day, Boot was suspended. On 23 February, Seven released a statement indicating Boot had left his employment with the network. However, no announcement was made as to any actions taken against off-camera staff over this incident, which Meakin described as \\"one of the more embarrassing\\" incidents he had had to deal with. =\\"Vietnamese Sting\\" controversy= On 8 May 2007, Today Tonight reported about an alleged Vietnamese-Australian welfare cheat named Dat Van Vu; though using the generalized title \\"Vietnamese Sting\\". This resulted in anger among the Australian Vietnamese community because of the association of ethnicity to criminality, and with the program's usage of the flag of Vietnam rather than the flag of South Vietnam which many Vietnamese Australians identify with. =Mercedes Corby= In 2007, Today Tonight ran a story on Mercedes Corby, sister of convicted drug trafficker Schapelle Corby. Mercedes' friend, Jodi Power, claimed Mercedes was a drug trafficker as well. Mercedes sued Seven for defamation, and in May 2008 a NSW Supreme Court jury decided in her favor, resulting in a settlement the next day of an undisclosed sum. Earlier, on 14 March 2007, Coren admitted in an interview with The Daily Telegraph that a private investigator hired by Seven lied about being an official to set up Mercedes. =Karl Stefanovic's alleged drinking controversy= On 7 May 2009, Today Tonight broadcast a segment on Today co-host Karl Stefanovic, alleging he was drunk on air during the post-Logies edition of Today. It reported the rumor Stefanovic was taken off air for more than two days following the incident. Nine said the claims were \\"desperate nonsense\\" and \\"wilfully false\\". Nine spokesman David Hurley said Stefanovic was tired, not drunk; that the reason he did not appear on Today was due to a prior engagement to appear on 60 Minutes; and that claims of Stefanovic being taken off air were a \\"pure invention of Channel Seven\\". =The Facebeef Group's Cyberbully Troll= On 11 March 2013, Today Tonight aired a longer than usual eight-minute expos√© on supposed cyberbully Tristan Barker, labelling him \\"the world's nastiest man.\\" The story featured \\"victim\\" Jasmine Frost, who accused Tristan of cyberbullying, and told reporter David Eccleston she had received \\"pictures of penises in the mail\\" from Tristan and his followers. Approximately four hours after the story aired, a videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A3a7v0iCV8 was posted on YouTube by 'Facebeef' member \\"Nebz Adlay\\", revealing Facebeef had constructed the entire story in order to trick Today Tonight. Frost appeared and revealed herself to be a longstanding member of Facebeef and the pair taunted Today Tonight for not conducting thorough research. The following day, Today Tonight released a statement admitting they were incorrect and called Jasmine an \\"attention seeker\\". The stunt received nationwide news coverage.

Its banking subsidiary, First Horizon (formerly First Tennessee), is the largest bank in Tennessee and the fourth largest regional banking company in the Southeast. Founded in 1864, it is the fourteenth oldest United States bank on the list of oldest banks in continuous operation. The company provides financial services including banking, wealth management, insurance, and trading services. History Frank S. Davis founded First National Bank, the first nationally chartered bank in Memphis after passage of the National Banking Act of 1863. The charter was received on March 25, 1864, during the American Civil War. The yellow fever epidemics in Memphis from 1867 through 1878 halted growth. The bank acquired German Bank in 1895. In 1914, the bank participated in the organization of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The bank merged with Central-State National Bank in 1926. In 1942, the bank opened its first suburban branch and by 1952, it operated 7 branches. In 1964, the bank moved into a new 23-story headquarters in downtown Memphis. By 1967, the bank was the largest bank in the Mid-South, when it was reorganized as the First National Holding Company. In 1971, the First Tennessee National Corporation was formed to allow the company to acquire other Tennessee banks. Allen B. Morgan was named president in 1960, chief executive in 1967, and chairman in 1969. In 1981, the company founded First Express, a check clearing business. During the 1980s, the company also expanded into mortgage brokerage, mortgage loan origination, and insurance. In 1993, the bank acquired MNC Mortgage. In 1994, the bank acquired Peoples Commercial Services Corporation. In 1999, to reflect its diversification, the bank adopted the slogan, All Things Financial. In 2004, the company changed its name to First Horizon National Corporation to reflect its interstate growth. In May 2007, the company acquired Republic Mortgage, based in Las Vegas. In September 2007, the company sold 34 branches outside of Tennessee, including 13 branches to M&T; Bank, 10 branches to Sterling Bank, 9 branches to Fifth Third, and 2 branches to FMCB Holdings. In June 2008, the company sold its residential-mortgage origination and servicing business to Metlife. In November 2008, the United States Department of the Treasury invested $866 million in the company as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program and in December 2010, the company repurchased the investment from the Treasury. On June 7, 2013, the bank acquired Mountain National Bank, which suffered from bank failure. In October 2015, the company acquired TrustAtlantic Bank. In December 2017, the company acquired Capital Bank Financial for $2.2 billion. Capital Bank later announced it would lease two floors of the 10-story One Glenwood in Raleigh. The lease included a sign on the building. First Horizon announced on June 11, 2019, that in fall of 2019 it would have the same name in all of its markets. The change encompassing First Tennessee Bank, Capital Bank, FTB Advisors and FTN Financial became effective at the close of business on October 25, 2019, with signage changes expected to be complete throughout those holdings by early 2020. Shortly after the rebranding, the company announced plans for a merger with IberiaBank of Lafayette, Louisiana, with the combined company's headquarters to be in Memphis under the First Horizon name.

The Rincon Mountains are one of five mountain ranges surrounding the Tucson valley. The other ranges include the most prominent, the Santa Catalina Mountains to the north, the Santa Rita Mountains to the south, the Tucson Mountains to the west, and the Tortolita Mountains to the northwest. Redington Pass separates the Rincon Mountains from the Santa Catalina Mountains. The Rincon Mountains are generally less rugged than the Santa Catalina Mountains and Santa Rita Mountains. The Rincon Mountains are also included in the Madrean sky island mountain ranges of southeast Arizona, extreme southwest New Mexico, and northern Sonora Mexico. Rinc√≥n is Spanish for corner, denoting the primary shape of the mountain range. Mica Mountain (8,664 feet), the high-point of the Rincons forms the apex, with Rincon Peak (8,482 feet) forming the southern point, and Tanque Verde Peak (7,049 feet) forming the western point of the corner. The interior of the corner is Rincon Valley (south and west of Mica Mountain), primarily former ranchland currently being converted to tract housing. Colossal Cave county park, a limestone cave and popular destination, is located on the east end of the Rincon Valley, north of the community of Vail. East of the Rincons are the Little Rincon Mountains. Between these two ranges is Happy Valley, a popular destination for locals for camping, hunting, and off-roading. Farther east is the San Pedro River of the San Pedro Valley, a holocene paleontology region. South of the Rincon Mountains, beyond Rincon Valley is the Cienega Creek and Interstate 10. Most of the Rincon Mountains are within Saguaro National Park, or in the Rincon Mountain Wilderness, , of the Coronado National Forest.

He studied and painted in Budapest and Western Europe. As an untitled member of the minor nobility, Joachim was entitled to bear the honorary prefix Csejtei, so prior to the Communist abolition of honorifics in 1947 his name might be found in the form \\"Csejtei Joachim Ferenc\\" (or \\"Cs. Joachim F.\\") in Hungarian, or in German \\"Franz Joachim von Csejthey\\". Early life Ferenc Joachim and his wife Margit with their three children. Szeged, Hungary, 1925. Joachim's parents were Ferenc Joachim and Emilia Metz of Szeged, Hungary. He had two brothers, Jozsef and K√°roly, and four sisters, Gizella, Mariska, Jol√°n, and Mici. The family was Roman Catholic. Some of his siblings were also artists in their own right: Jozsef was a sculptor and painter while Gizella became a stage actress. Ferenc Joachim was born in Szeged, in what was at that time the Austro-Hungarian Empire. For the first 36 years of his life he lived and worked in Hungary and in various parts of Western Europe. Little is known about the first 30 years of Joachim's life. It appears that Joachim was married twice. He married Margit Gr√°f (1892‚Äì1965) around 1912. They had three children: one daughter, Piroska (1913‚Äì2007), and two sons, Ferenc Gabriel (1920‚Äì1989) and Attila (1923‚Äì1947).Photographs of Piroska, Ferenc Gabriel, and Attila are available on Wikimedia Commons. Accessed 8 January 2008. Joachim studied painting in Budapest (Hungary), Vienna (Austria), Munich (Germany), and Paris (France). [] Hans Vollmer, Allgemeines Lexikon der bildenden K√ºnstler des XX. Jahrhunderts (Leipzig, 1953), vol. 2, p. 551. He studied with Hungarian art educator Simon Holl√≥sy at his private school in Munich, and periodically visited Holl√≥sy's Nagyb√°nya Artists Colony in Transylvania. Painting career Joachim circa 1929, in Szeged, Hungary. While his principal residences and studios were in his birthplace of Szeged and in Budapest, Joachim also painted in Rome, Venice, Marseilles, and the south of France. During his time in France he went by the name Fran√ßois Joachim. His works were exhibited in Paris, Rome, Venice, Berlin and Munich. An article reviewing a solo exhibition of Joachim's paintings in Budapest, in 1925, states that Joachim's work had been well- received in Paris, Rome, Munich and Venice, and that this particular exhibition had already received favourable notices in other Budapest newspapers, Pesti Hirlap and 8 Orai Ujsag, and in the Vienna newspapers Die Stunde and Neue Freie Presse. Joachim was a proponent of the late 19th-century concept of leaving the studio and painting in nature. One of his most productive periods was during one of his stays in Marseilles and along the Mediterranean coast, where he painted over a hundred canvases. In Szeged he was active in promoting the arts in the region. Articles from M≈±v√©szet in both 1910 and 1913 show him with other local artists. A publication from H√≥dmez≈ëv√°s√°rhely dated 15 April 1910 reports the annual spring exhibition of artists in Szeged, with Joachim Ferenc cited as the most modern of them, with a first-class sensibility for colors. Joachim's paintings were exhibited at the Salon d'Automne (1911) and Salon des Indepenedents (1913) in Paris, and at the Nemzeti Szalon (National Salon) in Budapest. His paintings were also exhibited at the Sz√©pm≈±veszeti M√∫zeum or Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest). An article documents that in April 1919 Joachim was a member of the committee of the Szeged Museum trying to save and catalogue the museum's collections following the ravages and chaos of World War I (during which Joachim had served in the Kaiserlich und k√∂niglich forces of the Austro-Hungarian Army). Another document, dated January 15, 1928, shows Ferenc Joachim to be a founding member of the \\"Alf√∂ld Artists Association\\" (\\"Alf√∂ldi M√ºv√©szek Egyes√ºlete\\") in Szeged. Today a small collection of his paintings (partly owned and partly on loan) is preserved in the repository of the \\"M√≥ra Ferenc M√∫zeum\\" in Szeged. One painting, \\"K≈ëb√°nya Alb√°ni√°ban\\" (Stone Quarry in Albania), is owned by the Hungarian National Gallery. All other paintings are in private hands, occasionally appearing at public art auctions in Hungary and the US. Family difficulties Portrait of Julia Graf. Oil on canvas, 60 cm x 80 cm, 1938. During the years of the Great Depression the family was reduced to poverty; in an interview in 1935 Joachim attributed his daughter's attempted suicide to their financial straits. During the Second World War a number of Joachim's relatives and in-laws were persecuted or murdered. Both of his sisters-in-law (one of whom, Julia Gr√°f, had sat for a portrait with him in 1938), their husbands and children died in the Budapest holocaust, while the fate of his three brothers-in-law is unknown. Joachim's younger son, Attila, enrolled as a student at the Hungarian Academy of Fine Arts in 1941, and graduated in 1946. His early death, the year after his graduation, was attributed to complications arising from internal injuries received from beatings by Hungarian Fascists and German Nazis, during the Budapest holocaust. Later life The final 20 years of Joachim's life, from 1944 to 1964, were spent in Communist Hungary.Private communication from Mrs. Piroska Porkol√°b, Joachim's daughter, aged 92, in conversations during July, August, September, October and November 2005: \\"He had a voracious intellectual curiosity which he fed incessantly by avid reading of literature, history, science, newspapers. He had many friends and acquaintances amongst his contemporaries and colleagues in the arts including painters, sculptors, writers, and musicians. He had never renounced anyone for any reasons. He had always protected anyone seeking his assistance. The last twenty-five years of his life, from the onset of World War II to his death, he lived under extreme adversity and hardships due to the German Nazi and then Russian communist occupations causing deprivations of basic human rights, human dignity, jobs, income, livelihood, artistic supplies and materials, artistic integrity.\\" His two surviving children, Piroska and Ferenc Gabriel, fled the country after the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, and found refuge in Canada, both later moving to the United States. Ferenc Gabriel, under the name Frank G. Joachim, became a research biologist and entomologist with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Metabolism and Radiation Laboratory. In their old age, Joachim and his wife were moved to separate old age homes: Joachim went to Gyula, where he died and was buried on September 16, 1964, at age 82; Margit went to Szentgotth√°rd, where she died and was buried at age 73 in 1965.

Early life Hawrelak was born in Shandro, Alberta to Ukrainian immigrants William and Anastasia Hawrelak (the family's ancestral name was –ì–∞–≤—Ä–∏–ª—è–∫ (Havryliak)). He married Pearl Shandro (daughter of Alberta MLA Andrew Shandro, after whom Hawrelak's home district was named) the pair would have three daughters. In 1945, Hawrelak moved to Edmonton and purchased the Prairie Rose Manufacturing Co., which made soft drinks. He served as president of the Alberta Farmer's Union and of the Edmonton Federation of Community Leagues before entering politics. Early career in municipal politics Hawrelak's first attempt at political office took place in the 1948 municipal election, in which he ran for Edmonton City Council and was defeated, finishing seventh of twelve candidates for alderman. He was more successful in the next election, winning the last available aldermanic position by finishing sixth of nine candidates after being backed by the Citizens' Committee, a municipal political party dominated by Anglo-Saxon businessmen. In 1951, he took over as mayor on an interim basis when Sidney Parsons had to leave the position for health reasons. In that year's election, he won the position more permanently by winning more than sixty-five percent of the vote and defeating the returned Parsons and one other candidate. First stint as mayor Hawrelak initially saw considerable political success: his re-election bids in the 1953 and 1955 elections were unopposed, and in the 1957 election he easily dispatched his two challengers, both former aldermen, winning more than sixty-five percent of the vote. Hawrelak presided over a time of prosperity resulting, in part, from the discovery of oil near Edmonton in 1947. The city was able to provide a variety of new facilities, including a main branch for the Edmonton Public Library, a new city hall, the Riverside Golf Course, the Valley Zoo, Fort Edmonton Park, the Groat Bridge, the Royal Alexandra Hospital, the Queen Elizabeth Planetarium, Borden Park, Coronation Park, Mayfair Park, and the Edmonton portion of the Yellowhead Trail (Highway 16). In 1958, Ed Leger - who would later join city council as the longest-serving alderman in Edmonton's history (1959‚Äì1986, except for a two year period after an unsuccessful run for mayor in 1961), later surpassed by Ron Hayter - presented a petition to city council that called for an investigation into the city administration. Leger alleged that Hawrelak had used his position to financially benefit himself, his family, and his associates. An ensuing inquiry by Justice Marshall Porter found Hawrelak guilty of \\"gross misconduct\\" - including, in some cases, attempts to influence rezoning of land he owned - in six different land transactions. Hawrelak resigned September 9, 1959, but continued to deny any wrongdoing. Return to office and second stint The city sued Hawrelak, and he ultimately paid $100,000 plus $4,000 in legal fees to settle the lawsuit; this settlement also made him eligible to again seek elected municipal office, which he did in the 1963 election. In an election that has been called the dirtiest in Edmonton's history, he narrowly defeated alderman Stanley A. Milner. His victory was marred by a riot that erupted when a group of students marching to city hall to protest Hawrelak's re-election victory were met by a mob loyal to the mayor, leading the Edmonton Journal - which was regularly critical of Hawrelak - to speculate that the mob was organized by the same people who \\"toured meetings during the recent election campaign with the sole purpose of preventing anti-Hawrelak candidates from speaking\\". Hawrelak was re-elected in the 1964 election, defeating incumbent alderman and former Member of Parliament George Prudham, but his second stint as mayor would also end prematurely: on March 11, 1965, Chief Justice C.C. McLaurin of the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta disqualified Hawrelak from his position after ruling that he had violated the City Act through his involvement with Sun Alta Builder's Ltd., of which he owned forty percent and which had bought land from the city while he was in office. Again Hawrelak denied wrongdoing, and appealed the decision up to the Supreme Court of Canada, which upheld it (he did win a partial victory in March 1975 when the same court reversed a ruling of a lower court that ordered that he return $80,117 in profits from the dealings to the city; the Supreme Court of Canada found that there were no profits to be returned). Out of office and federal politics Hawrelak Park, Edmonton. Hawrelak ran for mayor in the 1966 election, but was defeated by Vincent Dantzer, the man city council had chosen to replace him as mayor. This would be the only mayoral defeat Hawrelak would suffer in his career. After this defeat, he declared himself done with city politics. He turned his attention instead to the federal scene. In the 1957 federal election, Hawrelak, still mayor and before his political troubles had started, had run as the Liberal Party of Canada candidate in Edmonton East. He had come within three hundred votes of unseating incumbent Social Credit Party of Canada MP Ambrose Holowach, but had not hitherto made any subsequent bids for federal election. This changed with the 1968 federal election. Hawrelak ran in Edmonton Centre. Denied the Liberal nomination, he ran instead as an \\"Independent Liberal\\". He finished third, behind Progressive Conservative Steve Paproski and official Liberal Donald Gray. He may have had some impact after all, however: the gap between the Conservative Paproski and the Liberal Gray was fewer than two hundred votes, while the independent Liberal Hawrelak won more than seven thousand. Third stint and death Reversing himself, Hawrelak ran for mayor again in the 1974 election against incumbent Ivor Dent, future mayor Cec Purves, alderman David Ward, and three other candidates. Even in this crowded field, Hawrelak won more than forty-nine percent of the vote in his return to office. His last term was marked by a similar style of governance to his previous terms: he was accused of stacking city boards and commissions with his friends, he appointed a disbarred lawyer as his executive assistant, and allowed property taxes into his holdings to fall in arrears (which he characterized as an oversight). However, he also faced new opposition: the council on which he served included a number of urban reformers as well as his old nemesis, alderman Ed Leger. Hawrelak couldn't maintain the tight control to which he was accustomed. Thirteen months after his election, on November 7, 1975, William Hawrelak died of a heart attack. More than ten thousand people came to pay their respects as his body lay in city council chambers. Legacy In 1982, Mayfair Park was renamed William Hawrelak Park, in honour of Hawrelak and a legacy of his time as mayor, which included the period when Mayfair Park was created.

He earned degrees in chemistry and law from George Washington University and worked as a patent attorney in Connecticut & Washington, DC from 1947 to 1981. Several of Harness' works draw on his background as a lawyer. Harness died in 2005, at the age of 89, in North Newton, Kansas. Writing career Harness' first story, \\"Time Trap\\" (1948), is unusual for a first story in that it shows many of his recurring themes, among them art, time travel, and a hero undergoing a quasi-transcendental experience. His first novel was his most famous, Flight into Yesterday. It was first published as a novella in the May 1949 issue of Startling Stories (pp. 9‚Äì79), was expanded as a full-length novel (Bouregy & Curl, 1953), and was renamed Paradox Men by Donald Wollheim for reprint as the first half of Ace Double #D-118 in 1955.\\"I Did it For the Money\\" (Charles L.

It is approximately long. Course The Santa Cruz River east of Nogales just after re-entering the United States from Mexico. The Santa Cruz has its headwaters in the high intermontane grasslands of the San Rafael Valley to the southeast of Patagonia, Arizona, between the Canelo Hills to the east and the Patagonia Mountains to the west, just north of the international border. It flows southward into Mexico past Santa Cruz, Sonora and turns westward around the south end of the Sierra San Antonio near Miguel Hidalgo (San L√°zaro), thence north-northwest to reenter the United States just to the east of Nogales and southwest of Kino Springs. It then continues northward from the international border past the Tumacacori National Historical Park, Tubac, Green Valley, Sahuarita, San Xavier del Bac, Tucson, Marana, and Picacho Peak State Park to the Santa Cruz Flats just to the south of Casa Grande and the Gila River. Between Nogales and Tucson the river valley is flanked by the San Cayetano and Santa Rita Mountains on the east and the Atascosa, Tumacacori, and Sierrita Mountains on the west. Hydrography Most of the Santa Cruz River is usually a dry riverbed, unless the area receives significant rainfall. This was not always the case, but a combination of human errors and natural catastrophes in the late nineteenth century led to the decline of the Santa Cruz.THE DECLINE OF THE SANTA CRUZ RIVER Prior to this, water flowed perennially in a number of places, including along nine stretches in the Tucson area, and the river's banks were lined with cottonwood and mesquite bosques. Although there is some disagreement among historians and hydrologists as to what the biggest causes of the river's decline was, contributing human factors included overgrazing, excessive pumping of groundwater for agricultural irrigation and industry, and the construction of dams and ditches. In the mid-20th century, the river's stretch through Tucson dried up completely. The city of Nogales, Sonora, has been releasing treated sewage into the Santa Cruz River since 1951. This has resulted in the revival of several miles of riverbank within and north of the city of Nogales, Arizona.Tucson Citizen: Who will save the Santa Cruz In recent years, due to water conservation efforts and restoration projects, perennial flows have returned to a few parts of the Santa Cruz River in greater Tucson. In June 2019, the city of Tucson began releasing treated wastewater daily into the Santa Cruz River bed near West Silverlake Road as part of the Santa Cruz River Heritage Project. This has resulted in renewed perennial flow in an approximately stretch near downtown Tucson. Further upstream, perennial flows returned to a half-mile stretch of the river through the San Xavier Indian Reservation of the Tohono O ºodham Nation in 2019 as a result of reduced ground water pumping due to greater availability of water from the Central Arizona Project. This has led to the revival of vegetated riparian zones along the river, including areas of cottonwood shoots and seep- willow. Recreation The Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail parallels much of the Santa Cruz. In Marana, there are approximately ten paved miles of multi-use recreational path along the Santa Cruz, located on Tangerine Road and through the Gladden Farms community park.

The unit is best known for its role in liberating American prisoners of war (POWs) from the Japanese Cabanatuan POW camp near Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija, Philippines in January 1945. Origins The Scouts were organized on Fergusson Island, New Guinea, on 28 November 1943. Their purpose was to conduct reconnaissance and raider work in the Southwest Pacific Theater. The scouts often operated deep behind Japanese lines. They were under the personal command of Lieutenant General Walter Krueger, Commanding General of the U.S. Sixth Army. General Krueger wanted a unit that could provide timely vital intelligence on the enemy's troop numbers, unit types, and locations to the Sixth Army. General Krueger had previously received faulty intelligence reports from other sources outside of Sixth Army. Krueger sought to create an all volunteer elite unit consisting of small teams which could operate deep behind enemy lines. Their primary mission was to gather intelligence for the Sixth Army. The Alamo Scouts were so-named because Alamo Force was the name given to Krueger's command (and Sixth Army in particular) by General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Allied Commander of the SouthWest Pacific. (MacArthur deliberately created Alamo Force to give himself direct control of US Army units, as a parallel structure to the official Allied Ground Forces command, under Australian General Sir Thomas Blamey.) In addition, Krueger had personal links to San Antonio, Texas, location of the Alamo Mission and a personal interest in the Battle of the Alamo. The Alamo Scouts were an ad hoc unit and had no table of organization & equipment (TO&E;). Alamo Scouts Training CenterAccomplishments A team of Alamo Scouts, February 1944. A team of Alamo Scouts, February 1945. In the Scouts' first two years of operation they were credited with liberating 197 Allied prisoners in New Guinea. During the New Guinea Campaign, Alamo Scout missions normally lasted from one to three days and were mostly reconnaissance and intelligence gathering in nature, but as the Allies advanced into the Philippines the unit's mission expanded dramatically, with some missions lasting two months or longer. Furthermore, the unit assumed a central role in organizing large-scale guerrilla operations, establishing road watch stations, attempting to locate and capture or kill Japanese flag officers, and performing direct action missions, such as the Cabanatuan POW Camp liberation. In January 1945 the scouts were teamed with elements of the 6th Ranger Battalion and Filipino guerrilla units to liberate 513 POWs in a daring night attack. The scouts provided reconnaissance and tactical support for the 6th Ranger Battalion during the raid of the Cabanatuan Prison Camp. The Scouts performed advance reconnaissance of the POW camp prior to the 6th Rangers' Raid on the camp. Prior to the raid, two of the scouts dressed themselves as local Filipino rice farm workers. These two scouts then set up a covert observation post inside a shack in the rice fields that surrounded the POW camp. This hidden observation post was located within a few hundred yards of Japanese Army guard posts at the camp's fence line. The scouts were never discovered by the Japanese during this reconnaissance. The Scouts were credited with the capture of 84 Japanese prisoners of war, and only two Scouts were wounded in the mission. While not on missions, Alamo Scout teams were assigned as bodyguards for General Krueger and had specific instructions to kill the general if capture was imminent. Near the end of the war Alamo Scout teams were preparing for the invasion of Japan, where they were slated to conduct pre-invasion reconnaissance of Kyushu as part of Operation Downfall, but the war ended. The Alamo Scouts performed 110 known missions behind enemy lines, mainly in New Guinea and the Philippines, without losing a single man. The unit was disbanded at Kyoto, Japan, in November 1945. Legacy In 1988, the soldiers of the Alamo Scouts were awarded the Special Forces Tab in recognition for their services in World War II, including them in the lineage of the current United States Army Special Forces. The Raid at Cabanatuan, carried out by a combined team of Alamo Scouts, Rangers and Filipino guerrillas, has been depicted in feature films. Edward Dmytryk's 1945 film Back to Bataan opens by retelling the story of the raid on the Cabanatuan POW camp, including real life film of the POW survivors. The 2005 John Dahl film The Great Raid, based on the books The Great Raid on Cabanatuan and Ghost Soldiers, focused on the raid. In 1950, the Philippine Army named their special forces unit the Scout Ranger Regiment in honor of the Alamo Scouts and the US Army Rangers. Boy Scouts of America Former Alamo Scout Sergeant Major Kittleson founded the Alamo Scouts, a local Venture Scouting unit, in his hometown area Toeterville, Iowa after his retirement from the military. The organization offers a military style training environment for local youth. Troop 253 in East Grand Rapids, Michigan has an Alamo Scouts patrol, named in honor of the original unit.

Most of the shows are open to the public, except for certain trade shows which require registration with a business license. The key event of the Gem, Mineral & Fossil Showcase is the Tucson Gem & Mineral Show produced by the Tucson Gem and Mineral Society. This show has been held annually since 1955 and now occupies of the Tucson Convention Center. Many museums and universities, including the Smithsonian Institution and the Sorbonne, have displayed at the Tucson Gem and Mineral Show. The first Tucson Gem and Mineral Show was held in an elementary school in 1955 and shortly thereafter moved to a Quonset hut at the Tucson Fair Grounds. In 1973, it moved into the Tucson Community Center, first occupying the North Exhibit Hall, then expanding into the Arena and upper Arena concourse. After the completion of the new facility in 1990, which is now called the Tucson Convention Center, the Tucson Gem and Mineral Show now occupies the Arena, Exhibition Halls A-B-C, Galleria and Ballrooms. Katherine Rambo estimates that between 1996 and 2010 there was an average of about thirteen hundred total dealers from forty-nine states and thirty-two countries in attendance, annually. The Tucson Gem, Mineral & Fossil Showcase is one of the single highest revenue-producing events for the Tucson economy. The estimated economic impact in 2018 was $120 million.

A versatile and original scholar, he made important contributions to the studies of ancient history, epigraphy, philology, vernacular literature and literary theory. Biography A native of Haining, Zhejiang, he went to Shanghai to work as a proofreader for a newspaper, after failing to pass the Imperial Examination in his hometown, at the age of 22. There he studied in the Dongwen Xueshe (Êù±ÊñáÂ≠∏Á§æ), a Japanese language teaching school, and became a prot√©g√© of Luo Zhenyu. Sponsored by Luo, he left for Japan in 1901, studying natural sciences in Tokyo. Back in China one year later, he began to teach in different colleges, and devoted himself to the study of German idealism. He fled to Japan with Luo when the Xinhai Revolution took place in 1911. He returned to China in 1916, but remained loyal to the overthrown Manchu emperor. In 1924, he was appointed professor by the Tsinghua University, where he was known as one of the \\"Four Great Tutors,\\" along with the prominent Chinese scholars Liang Qichao, Chen Yinke, and Y. R. Chao. In 1927, Wang drowned himself in Kunming Lake in the Summer Palace before the National Revolutionary Army entered Beijing during the Northern Expedition. Chen Yinque's epitaph read: \\"The suicide of Wang was because he worried about losing the independent spirit and free thought he long cherished in his academic pursuit.\\" Legacy Wang focused on the studies of Chinese vernacular literature during the early year of his career. When he became convinced that Schopenhauer's metaphysics were not believable, he turned for solace to critical and philological studies of the novel Dream of the Red Chamber, as well as writing a concise history of the theaters of the Song and Yuan dynasties. Benjamin Schwartz, \\"Themes in intellectual history: May Fourth and After,\\" Cambridge History of China Volume 12 Republican China 1912-1949 Pt 1 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983), p. 418 Although its conclusions are controversial, his article \\"On A Dream of the Red Chamber\\" has been called \\"a monumental development in the history of modern Chinese criticism.\\"Q.S.

Hong Kong University Handle Later he changed his academic direction, focusing on philology and ancient history. His works on ancient history and philology are collected in Guantang Jilin (ËßÄÂ†ÇÈõÜÊûó). In these areas, Wang is remembered for his contributions to the study of oracle bone script and the history of the Shang dynasty. In 1917, Wang published a scholarly article entitled Study of the Ancestral Kings and Nobility Appearing in the Yin Oracular Inscriptions („ÄäÊÆ∑ÂçúËæ≠‰∏≠ÊâÄË¶ãÂÖàÂÖ¨ÂÖàÁéãËÄÉ„Äã) in which Wang identified 31 kings and ancestors of the Shang royal lineage as the recipients of sacrifices that were recorded in the Yinxu oracle bone inscriptions.

Such organizations include businesses, schools, interest- based user groups, clubs, charities, and governments. Enterprise software is an integral part of a (computer-based) information system; a collection of such software is called an enterprise system. Services provided by enterprise software are typically business-oriented tools, such as online shopping, and online payment processing, interactive product catalogue, automated billing systems, security, Business Process Management, enterprise content management, IT Service Management, customer relationship management, enterprise resource planning, business intelligence, project management, collaboration, human resource management, manufacturing, occupational health and safety, enterprise application integration, and enterprise forms automation. As enterprises have similar departments and systems in common, enterprise software is often available as a suite of customizable programs. Generally, the complexity of these tools requires specialist capabilities and specific knowledge. Enterprise computing is the information technology (IT) tools that businesses use for efficient production operations and back-office support. These IT tools cover database management, customer relationship management, supply chain management, business process management and so on. Definitions Enterprise software is a collection of computer programs that have common business applications, tools for modelling how the entire organization works, and development tools for building applications unique to the organization.Management Information Systems Glossary of Terms The software is intended to solve an enterprise-wide problem, rather than a departmental problem. Enterprise level software aims to improve the enterprise's productivity and efficiency by providing business logic support functionality. According to Martin Fowler, \\"Enterprise applications are about the display, manipulation, and storage of large amounts of often complex data and the support or automation of business processes with that data.\\"Martin Fowler, \\"Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture\\" (2002). Addison Wesley. Although there is no single, widely accepted list of enterprise software characteristics,What is Enterprise Software? they generally include performance, scalability, and robustness. Furthermore, enterprise software typically has interfaces to other enterprise software (for example LDAP to directory services) and is centrally managed (a single admin page, for example).Gartner Group: IT Glossary - enterprise application software Enterprise application software performs business functions such as order processing, procurement, production scheduling, customer information management, energy management, and accounting. It is typically hosted on servers and provides simultaneous services to many users, typically over a computer network. This is in contrast to a single-user application that is executed on a user's personal computer and serves only one user at a time. Enterprise system Enterprise systems (ES) are large-scale enterprise software packages that support business processes, information flows, reporting, and data analytics in complex organizations. While ES are generally packaged enterprise application software (PEAS) systems they can also be bespoke, custom developed systems created to support a specific organization's needs. Types of enterprise systems include: * enterprise resources planning (ERP) systems, * enterprise planning systems, and * customer relationship management software. Although data warehousing or business intelligence systems are enterprise-wide packaged application software often sold by ES vendors, since they do not directly support execution of business processes, they are often excluded from the term. Enterprise systems are built on software platforms, such as SAP's NetWeaver and Oracle's Fusion, and databases. From a hardware perspective, enterprise systems are the servers, storage and associated software that large businesses use as the foundation for their IT infrastructure. These systems are designed to manage large volumes of critical data. These systems are typically designed to provide high levels of transaction performance and data security.  Types  Enterprise software can be categorized by business function. Each type of enterprise application can be considered a \\"system\\" due to the integration with a firm's business processes. Categories of enterprise software may overlap due to this systemic interpretation. For example, IBM's Business Intelligence platform (Cognos), integrates with a predictive analytics platform (SPSS) and can obtain records from its database packages (Infosphere, DB2). Blurred lines between package functions make delimitation difficult, and in many ways larger software companies define these somewhat arbitrary categories. Nevertheless, certain industry standard product categories have emerged, and these are shown below: * Business Intelligence (BI) * Business Process Management (BPM) * Content Management System (CMS) * Customer Relationship Management (CRM) * DataBase Management System (DBMS) - such as Master Data Management (MDM) and Data Warehousing (DW, DWH or EDW) * Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) - which is a broad category covering: Accounting, Human Resource, Corporate performance and governance, Customer Services, Sales, Procurement, Production, Distribution * Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) * Human Resource Management (HRM) * Knowledge Management (KM) * Low-code Development Platforms (LCDP) * Product Data Management (PDM) * Product Information Management (PIM) * Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) * Supply Chain Management (SCM) * Software Configuration Management (SCM) - such as Version Control System (VCS) * Networking and Information Security ** Intrusion Detection Prevention (IDS) - and by extension Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) ** Software Defined Networking (SDN) - including SD-WAN ** Security Information Event Management (SIEM) - which can combine Security Information Management (SIM) and Security Event Management (SEM) * Others that don't fit into well-known standard categories, Backup software, Billing Management, Accounting software See also * Application Release Automation Software * Application software * Business informatics * Business software * Enterprise architecture * Enterprise forms automation * Enterprise planning system * Global Information Network Architecture * IBM Smarter Computing * Identity management * Identity management system * Information technology management * Integrated business planning * Management information system * Operational risk management * Retail software * Server (computing) * Strategic information system References Category:Business software Category:Enterprise architecture ","title":"Enterprise software"},{"id":"2302523","text":"Unyanyembe is a town in Tanzania (formerly German East Africa). It was one of the locations visited by Henry Morton Stanley during his search for Dr Livingstone. The town is located in the Tabora Region. In the 19th-century it was the headquarters of a kingdom that controlled Tabora as well as other areas. Kingdom of Unyanyembe Unyanyembe was a 19th-century kingdom where the main ethnic group was known as the Nyamwezi, although many other ethnic groups were present as well. Ifundikila (reigned 1840-1858) was a king of Unyanyembe who oversaw major cooperation with a large Arab-Swahili commercial class in his kingdom. The two main bases of this population were Tabora and Kwihara. According to descriptions left by Sir Richard Burton this population had large gardens, large numbers of slaves and concubines, and in some cases controlled private armies sometimes numbering up to 300 people. One of the most prominent Arabs, Mohammad ibn Juma, married one of Ifundikila's daughters. However it needs to be kept in mind that the Arabs and Swahili's were a foreign commercial class, they did not exercise political control in the kingdom. The next king of Unyanyembe was Mnywasela. He was able to come to power in large part due to support of the Swahilis and Arabs. He expelled his main rival for the throne, Mkasiwa from the kingdom. After a few years the people of Unyanyembe tried of Mnywasela's rule, and a faction worked to return Mkasiwa from his exile in the Kingdom of Ulyankhulu. 1860 saw this struggle escalate to the point that Mnywasela was driven from power and Mkasiwa made the new ruler. The next four years saw persistent fighting as Mnywasela tried to regain power, but Mksaiwa was able to retain his power. In 1875 Mkasiwa was succeeded as king by Isike.Dictionary of African Biography, p. 225 From 1871-1884 Unyanyembe was involved in a war with Urambo. This was fought because Urambo's ruler, Mirambo, had extended his power to control the main routes of trade between Unyanyembe and the Swahili coast, and both the Arab- Swahili merchants and the Nyamwezi objected to his transit fees. During this war the Barghash the Sultan of Zanzibar sent a force of 3,000 to fight on the side of Unanyembe. Prior to the war he had also appointed a consul of Zanzibar to be based in Tabora. Unyanyembe also had a large population of the Tutsi in the 19th century. Although they came primarily as herdsmen, many were recruited into the army for the war against UramboCambridge History of Africa, Vol. 5, p. 306-309 See also *Vicariate Apostolic of Unyanyembe Category:Populated places in Shinyanga Region Category:Former countries in Africa ","title":"Unyanyembe"},{"id":"2302526","text":"The McAlpine Locks and Dam are a set of locks and a hydroelectric dam at the Falls of the Ohio River at Louisville, Kentucky. They are located at mile point 606.8, and control a long navigation pool. The locks and their associated canal were the first major engineering project on the Ohio River, completed in 1830 as the Louisville and Portland Canal, designed to allow shipping traffic to navigate through the Falls of the Ohio. History Tugboat at McAlpine Locks and Dam, 2012 Paddling through McAlpine From 1925 to 1927, the dam for generating hydroelectric power was added, and the locks were expanded, first by a private company and then by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The hydroelectric plant at the time was the seventh largest hydroelectric plant in the United States. The system was renamed the McAlpine Locks and Dam in 1960 in honor of William McAlpine, who was the only civilian to have ever served as district engineer for the Corps of Louisville. At present, the normal pool elevation is above sea level and the drainage area above the dam is 91,170 square miles (236,000 km¬≤). The average daily flow at McAlpine is 118,000 cubic feet per second (3,340 m¬≥/s). The lock chambers are located at the dam on the Kentucky side of the Ohio River and are capable of a normal lift of between the McAlpine pool upstream and the Cannelton pool downstream. The hydroelectric plant consists of eight turbine units with a net power generation capacity of 80,000 kilowatts. In October 2003, McAlpine was designated a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The McAlpine locks underwent a 10-year, $278 million expansion project scheduled to be completed in 2008, but was completed in early 2009.

Biography Short was born July 11, 1866 near Elora, Ontario and studied law at the University of Toronto before coming to Alberta in 1889. He articled to James Alexander Lougheed from 1891 until 1894, when he was called to the provincial bar. That year, he moved to Edmonton and opened a law practice before partnering with Charles Cross in 1900 to form Short & Cross (which still exists today under the name Duncan Craig LLP). He married Henrietta McMaster on February 7, 1900; the pair would have one son and one daughter. In 1899, Short was elected to sit as a public school trustee, which he did until he was acclaimed as mayor during the 1901 election. He faced no opposition to his re-election bid in 1902, and defeated his former school board colleague H. C. Taylor in the 1903 election to retain the title. This allowed him to be mayor when Edmonton's status changed from town to city in 1904, and to author the city charter. He did not seek re- election in the 1904 election. During this first stint as mayor, Short oversaw the extension of the railroad to the north side of the North Saskatchewan River in 1902 (an event which occasioned the proclamation of a civic holiday by Mayor Short). He returned to the mayoralty in December 1912 by defeating two candidates, including future mayor Joseph Clarke. His re-election bid in 1913 was foiled by William McNamara, making him the first mayor in Edmonton's history to lose a re-election bid. After this defeat, Short did not return to politics.

It is located five nautical miles (6 mi, 9 km) southwest of the central business district of Cape Girardeau, a city in Cape Girardeau County, Missouri, United States. The airport is used for general aviation, and has scheduled service by United Express partner SkyWest with subsidized Essential Air Service program flights to Chicago O‚ÄôHare. It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017‚Äì2021, which categorized it as a commercial service - nonprimary airport based on passenger enplanements (the commercial service category requires at least 2,500 enplanements per year). Facilities and aircraft Cape Girardeau Regional Airport covers an area of 557 acres (225 ha) at an elevation of 342 feet (104 m) above mean sea level. It has two runways: 10/28 is 6,500 by 150 feet (1,981 x 46 m) with a concrete surface; 2/20 is 3,997 by 100 feet (1,218 x 30 m) with an asphalt/concrete surface.

In January 2019, there were 57 aircraft based at this airport: 48 single-engine, 5 multi-engine, 2 jet and 2 helicopter. Airlines and destinations=Passenger=History Opened in 1943, the airport was constructed by the United States Army Air Forces. Known as Harris Army Airfield, the airfield was a primary (stage 1) pilot training airfield assigned to AAF Flying Training Command, Southeast Training Center (later Eastern Flying Training Command). It was operated under contract to Cape Institute of Aeronautics, Inc., with the civil instructors under the USAAF 73d Flying Training Detachment. Fairchild PT-19s were the primary trainer at the airfield. Contract flying training was short at the airfield, the school closing during the late summer of 1944 with the draw down of AAFTC's pilot training program. The airfield was turned over to civil control at the end of the war though the War Assets Administration (WAA).

Its formations included white South African police officers, usually seconded from the South African Security Branch or Special Task Force, and black volunteers from Ovamboland. Koevoet was patterned after the Selous Scouts, a multiracial Rhodesian military unit which specialised in counter-insurgency operations. Its title was an allusion to the metaphor of \\"prying\\" insurgents from the civilian population. Koevoet was active during the South African Border War between 1979 and 1989, during which it carried out hundreds of search and destroy operations against the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN). Koevoet's methods were controversial, and the unit was accused of committing numerous atrocities against civilians. Over the course of the war, it killed or captured 3,225 insurgents and participated in 1,615 individual engagements. Koevoet was disbanded in 1989 as part of the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 435, which effectively ended the South African Border War and ushered in South West African independence as Namibia. History=Background= Following the end of World War I, the German Empire was dismantled and its African colonies granted to Allied nations as various League of Nations mandates. The mandate system was formed as a compromise between those who advocated an Allied annexation of former German and Turkish territories, and another proposition put forward by those who wished to grant them to an international trusteeship until they could govern themselves. South Africa received the former German possession of South West Africa and was permitted to administer it until that territory's inhabitants were prepared for political self-determination. However, the South African government interpreted the mandate as a veiled annexation and took steps to integrate South West Africa as a domestic province. South Africa's attempts to absorb South West Africa became a matter of contention during the 1960s as a result of the increasingly widespread decolonisation of the African continent. Over the next decade, low intensity conflicts broke out in many of the remaining European colonies as militant African nationalist movements emerged, often with direct backing from the Soviet Union and revolutionary left-wing governments in the Middle East. The nationalists were often encouraged to take up arms by the success of indigenous anti-colonial guerrilla movements around the world, namely in French Indochina and French Algeria, as well as the rhetoric of contemporary African statesmen such as Ahmed Ben Bella, Gamal Abdel Nasser, and Julius Nyerere. During the early 1960s, new nationalist parties such as the South West African National Union (SWANU) and South West African People's Organisation (SWAPO) made determined attempts to establish indigenous political structures for an independent South West Africa. In 1962, SWAPO formed a militant wing, known as the South West African Liberation Army (SWALA), and began sending recruits to Egypt and the Soviet Union for guerrilla training. In 1966 SWALA initiated an insurgency against the South African government, sparking what would later evolve into a wider regional conflict known as the South African Border War. As the war intensified, so did international sympathy for SWAPO's cause. The United Nations declared that South Africa had failed in its obligations to ensure the moral and material well-being of the indigenous inhabitants of South West Africa, and had thus disavowed its own mandate. On 12 June 1968, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution which proclaimed that, in accordance with the desires of its people, South West Africa be renamed Namibia. United Nations Security Council Resolution 269, adopted in August 1969, declared South Africa's continued occupation of Namibia illegal. In recognition of this landmark decision, SWALA was renamed the People's Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN). =Formation of Koevoet= PLAN insurgents on the march From the early to late 1970s, the brunt of counter-insurgency operations was borne by the South African Defence Force (SADF). The SADF's primary source of manpower were white national servicemen fulfilling their terms of compulsory military service under the leadership of professional career officers. The initial commitment of South African troops to the South West African theatre in 1974 was about 15,000 men. Beginning the same year, however, there was also increasingly widespread enlistment of local armed auxiliaries and semi-official militias. The most powerful armed group outside the direct command structure of the SADF emerged in Ovamboland, SWAPO's traditional political stronghold and the source of its support base. The Ovamboland civil administration employed a local militia known as the Ovambo Home Guard, established to protect local officials who were often the target of PLAN assassination attempts. The Ovambo Home Guard was assembled, as time passed, into larger numbered units or attached to regular SADF battalions. By late 1978, the number of Ovambo Home Guard personnel stood at about 3,000. Their relative effectiveness compared to national servicemen sent out from South Africa, who were unfamiliar with the terrain and environment and had more difficulty adapting to Ovamboland, was noted by the government. This and other developments resulted in a deliberate policy of \\"Namibianisation\\", a reference to the Vietnamization programme the United States had pursued during the Vietnam War. The war effort became less likely to entail clear-cut confrontations between foreign South African troops and local PLAN insurgents, but significant numbers of Namibians fighting under South African command. The main objectives of Namibianisation were to establish a self-sufficient military infrastructure in South West Africa, reinforce the perception of a domestic civil conflict rather than an independence struggle, and reduce casualty rates among South Africa's national servicemen, to which the government was especially sensitive. Furthermore, the SADF was overstretched and if efficient local forces could be raised to take over the bulk of the defensive and local security tasks, it would be more free to pursue conventional offensive operations. Both the SADF and South African Police (SAP) launched parallel initiatives to create Ovambo counter-insurgency units between 1976 and 1980. The SADF's programme resulted in 101 Battalion, while the SAP formed Koevoet. A senior officer with the SAP's Security Branch, Hans Dreyer, was appointed to lead the latter. Dreyer had served with the SAP in Rhodesia during the Rhodesian Bush War and drew heavily on his operational experiences there while shaping Koevoet's mandate and organisational structure. Koevoet was to be patterned directly after the Selous Scouts, a Rhodesian special forces unit which included large numbers of former insurgents. The SAP especially appreciated the small unit tactics of the Selous Scouts, which had demonstrated how a few operators, disguised as insurgents and trained to high levels of subterfuge, could have an effect utterly disproportionate to their size. Koevoet was established in June 1979, at which time the unit consisted of six white South African policemen and 60 of the most skilled trackers from the Ovambo Home Guard. The trackers received three months of additional reconnaissance training from SADF special forces before being deployed into Ovamboland. They were also instructed in criminal investigation techniques and police procedure by the SAP. In May 1979, they captured their first insurgent. Koevoet was formally known as \\"Operation K\\" of the SAP Security Branch's special operations division, but that title was almost never used. Its existence remained a closely guarded secret until June 1980, when church newspapers in Ovamboland began circulating rumours of a new special forces group linked to assassination of SWAPO sympathisers. The rumours had their basis in a \\"death list\\" of prominent Ovambo political figures and businessmen who were covert sympathisers of SWAPO, which was allegedly recovered from the body of a local politician killed in a motor accident. A number of individuals on the list were subsequently assassinated. While South Africa denied the report, officials did name Koevoet and praise it for its efficiency. Koevoet's initial role was to engage in intelligence gathering for the SADF, but it soon adopted its own counter-insurgency campaign of infiltration and raids. Being a police unit, Koevoet also investigated politically motivated murders and property destruction. The unit rapidly expanded to about 3,000 personnel, about the size of the Ovambo Home Guard. At first the numbers of recruits were modest, due in part to limited training facilities and the time it would take to provide them with officers. This problem was partly solved by training Koevoet recruits at the Police Counter-Insurgency School in Maleoskop, South Africa. There, the recruits received instruction on a unique hybrid syllabus which combined specialist police skills such as anti-riot tactics, road security, and conventional counter-terrorism with basic infantry training resembling that of the SADF and counter-insurgency theory. The disbandment of the Selous Scouts in 1980 provided Koevoet with an influx of Rhodesian officers from that unit who were recruited by the SAP. White Namibians were also recruited in modest numbers as Koevoet officers, although the SAP faced stiff competition in this regard from the SADF. Most white South African policemen were transferred to Koevoet as a result of personal referrals. The overwhelming majority of black Koevoet operators were applicants from the Ovambo Home Guard, who wanted regular employment and better pay. The only prerequisite was that they had to speak Afrikaans or English, in order to communicate with their white officers. The SAP occasionally recruited Ovambos from Angola, including unemployed former soldiers of the Portuguese colonial army and insurgents from the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), who met these qualifications. Competition for employment with Koevoet was fierce due to the relatively high pay and benefits, including life insurance, offered by the SAP. =Operational service= PLAN units operating in Ovamboland were kept supplied by a constant flow of insurgents and war materiel along external infiltration routes through Angola. Koevoet monitored an area adjacent to the Angolan border with screening patrols coordinated between three permanent base strongpoints at Opuwo, Rundu, and Oshakati. It was also permitted to establish its own internment facility for captured PLAN prisoners just north of Windhoek. Patrols were carried out in Casspir mine-protected vehicles and sometimes lasted for weeks on end. Koevoet operators spent most of their time following suspicious tracks in search of insurgents, sometimes for over a hundred kilometres. PLAN was forced to alter its tactics accordingly. Following raids and attacks, PLAN cadres would scatter. Many ceased wearing military boots with readily identifiable sole patterns and walked barefoot or in civilian shoes. They camouflaged their tracks, retraced their steps, and changed footwear to throw off Koevoet trackers. More commonly, the insurgents would withdraw until they had reached appropriate terrain, then ambush the Koevoet response team. SAP Casspir similar to those utilised by Koevoet. In April 1980, Administrator-General Gerrit Viljoen announced that transfer of some control over local military and police forces to Namibians would occur once the necessary structures were implemented. This marked a new step in South Africa's Namibianisation campaign, and in 1985 Koevoet was formally integrated with the South West African Police (SWAPOL). At the time, 80% of Koevoet's manpower consisted of locals from Ovamboland, with the remaining 20% being white officers and Ovambos from elsewhere, namely Angola. Off-duty Koevoet operators were prime targets for PLAN assassination attempts; between 1979 and 1982, for example, at least 198 were killed by insurgents at home. By 1982, about 40 Koevoet operators were being killed in targeted assassinations per year. Their families were also subject to intimidation. Thereafter, the South African government permitted Koevoet personnel to retain their weapons at home. In 1983, Koevoet attracted considerable controversy when an Angolan citizen serving with the unit, Jonas Paulus, was convicted of murder, attempted rape, and armed robbery by the South West African Supreme Court in Windhoek. Paulus and an accomplice went on a crime spree with a captured PLAN rifle, and had identified themselves as insurgents. The duo killed an elderly farmer and abducted several young girls, after which they were captured by other members of Koevoet and turned over to the civil police. Paulus was sentenced to death and hanged in Windhoek on 4 June 1985. Around the same time, a white Koevoet non-commissioned officer, Norman Abrahams, appeared in court on charges of having murdered a suspected SWAPO sympathiser in his custody. The charges were dropped after the prosecution failed to establish whether Abrahams or one of several other Koevoet personnel present had actually committed the murder; the South African government reached an out of court settlement with the victim's family. These cases were notable because they generated considerable publicity about Koevoet in South Africa itself, and forced the unit to disclose details of its operations previously kept secret. For example, the use of a PLAN weapon by Paulus was explained by the fact that Koevoet possessed an inventory of captured uniforms and arms, which members often used to impersonate insurgents. An Atrocities Liaison Committee was also established in Ovamboland to review excesses committed by members of the security forces while on duty. The Paulus and Abrahams trials caused a public outcry, compelling SWAPOL to issue a statement that it would not condone any atrocities committed by Koevoet and would not hesitate to prosecute members of that unit. For the first time SWAPOL's civil police and Criminal Investigation Department (CID) began internal investigations of Koevoet operations. In 1977, South West Africa's administrator-general had issued AG Proclamation 9, which empowered any non-commissioned officer of the SAP (and subsequently, SWAPOL) to arrest and detain anybody in designated \\"security districts\\", including Ovamboland, without a warrant. Koevoet evoked this proclamation to detain suspects for up to thirty days without trial, and simply evoked it again once the thirty days had expired, in effect giving itself the power of indefinite detention. Its transition of jurisdiction to SWAPOL, however, opened the unit to more scrutiny in the local judicial system, and in 1986 the Windhoek Supreme Court ruled that Koevoet could not hold suspects for more than thirty days without legal representation. This was because captured insurgents were not held as prisoners of war, but rather apprehended by a police unit for trial in open courts as common law criminals. =The 1988 ceasefire and final PLAN offensive= As a result of the Brazzaville Protocol and subsequent Tripartite Accord, South Africa agreed to grant Namibia independence in exchange for a parallel Cuban withdrawal from Angola and a commitment by the Angolan government to cease all assistance to PLAN. Under the terms of the agreement, both the Cuban withdrawal and the independence process in Namibia would be monitored by two multinational peacekeeping forces known as the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (UNAVEM) and the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG), respectively. UNTAG planned to confine both PLAN and the SADF to their respective bases, demobilise all paramilitary forces that belonged to neither the SADF nor to the civil police, and supervise the return of refugees via designated entry points to participate in new elections. PLAN and the South African security forces began observing an informal truce which went into effect on 10 August 1988. This was scheduled to become a permanent ceasefire on 1 April 1989, at which time UNTAG was supposed to arrive in force and monitor the belligerent parties. However, UNTAG's deployment was beset with delays, and PLAN was able to begin covertly moving its forces in Angola to the border. UN Secretary-General Javier P√©rez de Cu√©llar declared that Koevoet was considered a paramilitary force not part of the SADF or the civil police, and should therefore be disbanded. The continued existence of that unit, he claimed, contravened the spirit of the independence process and their use of heavy weapons violated specific provisions concerning what equipment SWAPOL was permitted to carry to maintain basic law and order. South Africa bowed to pressure and effectively deactivated Koevoet in December 1988, although the unit could still be remobilised as needed. PLAN had consistently maintained that a precondition of any settlement was that it be permitted to establish base camps inside Namibia. The South African government consistently rejected PLAN's demands, likely because it feared the insurgents would interfere with the political process. The strategy of taking advantage of a ceasefire to establish an armed presence inside the country had previously been employed by other militant groups in the region, namely the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA). PLAN interpreted a general directive by the UN for all Namibian exiles to return home as de facto approval for it to begin its deployment. The insurgent commanders assured their troops that sympathetic UN personnel would provide them secure passage once inside Namibia. On the morning of 1 April, the first PLAN cadres crossed into Ovamboland, unhindered by UNTAG, which had failed to monitor their activity in Angola due to the delays in its arrival. South Africa accused PLAN of violating the ceasefire. With tensions rising, de Cu√©llar immediately contacted SWAPO's delegation at New York and ordered it to rein in PLAN. At the end of the day, with no signs of the PLAN advance abating, the UN Special Representative in Namibia, Martti Ahtisaari, lifted all restrictions confining the SADF to its bases. The responsibility of stopping the incursion fell to SWAPOL until six battalions of South African army regulars could be mobilised and deployed to Ovamboland. In light of this situation, Ahtisaari granted the South African government's request to remobilise Koevoet. The decision was made after joint consultations with South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha and UNTAG commander Dewan Prem Chand. The number of Koevoet operators authorised for remobilisation was approximately the size of two battalions. Koevoet and other SWAPOL units were able to fight off PLAN in a series of chaotic delaying actions until the SADF's arrival. Combined SADF and SWAPOL forces proceeded to drive PLAN back across the border in a counteroffensive known as Operation Merlyn. Koevoet's key role in containing the initial PLAN advance had the effect of persuading many South African officials that it was the only force capable of keeping the peace in Ovamboland during the political transition. Louis Pienaar, the territory's Administrator-General, refused to withdraw Koevoet from Ovamboland after Operation Merlyn was concluded. According to Pienaar, UNTAG's failure to stop the incursion demonstrated it was impotent to ensure PLAN maintained the ceasefire. Koevoet was needed to prevent further infiltration attempts by insurgents in the future. Lieutenant General Dolf Gouws, commissioner of SWAPOL, also released statements in which he declared that \\"if Koevoet were removed, the way would be open to lawless government\\". As a compromise, the UN permitted Koevoet to continue operating in Ovamboland, albeit in an ostensibly civil role; operators were prohibited from carrying any weapons other than handguns and were restricted to the mundane duties of maintaining public order. In practice, Koevoet disregarded the UN's directives and continued carrying out counter-insurgency patrols with automatic weapons. The fact that the individual operators were allowed to keep their personal weapons at home made efforts to disarm them largely impractical. =Disbandment= Koevoet's continued presence in Ovamboland became a matter of serious contention as UNTAG began supervising the return of Namibian refugees to participate in the territory's upcoming elections, many of whom were SWAPO supporters. Koevoet operators, who continued to perceive SWAPO as their enemy, responded by breaking up political rallies held by the returnees. Within a few weeks of its deployment, UNTAG had received over fifty formal complaints from Ovamboland residents, alleging misconduct on the part of the security forces and Koevoet in particular. Koevoet was accused of assaulting SWAPO supporters and firing into crowds at rallies with live ammunition. Namibian refugees being repatriated from Angola were intimidated by Koevoet's presence due to its controversial reputation among exiles in general and SWAPO supporters in particular. On 3 April, de Cu√©llar had notified the UN Security Council that Koevoet had been reactivated. The decision to remobilise Koeveot, while not in accord with the agreements which the belligerent parties and the UN had concluded, was credited with defusing a potential crisis. Nevertheless, the Security Council demanded that South Africa disband Koevoet permanently. Pienaar refused to do so, citing the April incursion. De Cu√©llar approached SWAPO officials and insisted they refrain from undertaking further military operations, which South Africa could use as a pretext to justify the continued deployment of Koevoet. He also flew to Pretoria to meet with Pik Botha and South African Minister of Law and Order Adriaan Vlok. During the meeting, the South African officials offered to take steps towards demobilising Koevoet in exchange for UNTAG sharing intelligence it possessed on PLAN movements and activities, as well as taking steps to demobilise PLAN. De Cu√©llar agreed to work with the Angolan government and SWAPO president Sam Nujoma to ensure PLAN was properly demobilised. In late April, UNTAG again lifted all restrictions confining the SADF to its bases, allowing the security forces to remove arms caches from Ovamboland and verify the absence of any remaining insurgents. By the end of May, nearly all the PLAN insurgents were accounted for, and were confined to their bases in Angola above the 16th parallel south under close UNTAG and UNHCR supervision. Likewise, the SADF returned to its bases. UNTAG systematically disarmed the insurgents and repatriated them to Namibia as civilian refugees without differentiating between members of PLAN and SWAPO's political wing. In all, 43,400 SWAPO members were repatriated to Namibia, at least 32,000 of whom were former insurgents. SWAPOL responded to these overtures by reducing the size of Koevoet to about 1,600 personnel; the remaining operators were reassigned to other divisions. Prior to September 1989 between 1,200 and 2,000 Koevoet operators received new assignments and postings within SWAPOL. UNTAG continued receiving complaints of violence and political intimidation being committed by ex-Koevoet elements in the civil police. UNTAG had initially included a small civil police contingent of 500, but this was increased to 1,000 in May 1989 and subsequently to 1,500 by September. The UNTAG police contingent, known as CIVPOL, was tasked with monitoring SWAPOL's activities and discouraging the further integration of Koevoet operators with the civil police. As part of its mandate, CIVPOL performed joint patrols with Koevoet and other SWAPOL units. This proved nearly impossible because Ovamboland was still inundated with land mines planted by PLAN insurgents and CIVPOL lacked mine-protected vehicles like the Koevoet Casspirs. The CIVPOL vehicles also possessed inferior off-road performance compared to the Casspirs and would often be left behind during the joint patrols. UNTAG initially rejected CIVPOL's requests for its own Casspirs due to the claims touted by PLAN that these vehicles were associated with repression of the Namibian people. This reasoning was later abandoned due to the practical difficulties of the joint patrols, and CIVPOL was finally permitted to acquire several Casspirs from South Africa. Acts of political intimidation witnessed by CIVPOL monitors could be reported to their local headquarters, which in turn lodged complaints with the local SWAPOL precinct. On 16 August, South Africa's acting state president F.W. de Klerk ordered Koevoet confined to its bases, and the unit effectively ceased operations. Almost two weeks later, United Nations Security Council Resolution 640 was passed, condemning Koevoet for its apparent \\"intimidation and harassment of the civilian population\\" and calling for its immediate disbandment, as well as the dismantling of its command structure. In late September, the South African government demobilised 1,200 Koevoet operators. The remaining 400 operators continued to remain on standby until 31 October, when the unit was formally disbanded. SWAPOL also took steps to demobilise ex-Koevoet operators integrated into the civil police, but this proved to be a more gradual process. =Postwar status= Due to concerns that unemployed and poorly educated Koevoet veterans would use their paramilitary skills for criminal purposes, the South African government announced it would permit any discharged member of Koevoet to continue drawing pay indefinitely until Namibian independence. Koevoet officers benefited from a pension fund and pension payment system established for them some years prior to independence. Their pensions were paid by the South African government until 1990, after which the Namibian government assumed responsibility for the pension system. No pension deductions were made from the schemes of constables or non- commissioned officers. The Namibian government also assumed responsibility for severance pay following independence; in 1990 each unemployed Koevoet veteran received lump sums ranging from $500 to $1,500 in Namibian currency. These benefits were only awarded to members of Koevoet who had served with the unit between 1988 and 1990; those with earlier service records were excluded. Most reintegration programmes devoted to Namibian veterans have explicitly excluded ex-Koevoet operators, who became the object of national stigma due to their service with such a controversial unit. Following Namibian independence, all paramilitary elements of the Namibian police were consolidated into a new unit, the Special Field Force.World Police Encyclopedia, ed. by Dilip K. Das & Michael Palmiotto published by Taylor & Francis. 2004. pp. 583-588. Conventional counter-terrorism became the responsibility of the unrelated Special Reserve Force. Structure and organisation theoretically self- governing status under South African law. In the northern part of the country, it was these areas where PLAN (and by extension, Koevoet) were most active. Koevoet's jurisdiction spanned three regions in northern Namibia: Kaokoland, Ovamboland, and Kavangoland. Operations were coordinated by a single headquarters at Oshakati, with two smaller regional headquarters being established in Opuwo and Rundu. Basic training for Koevoet operators was carried out at a training school at Ondangwa, although more specialised instruction could later be provided in South Africa. Koevoet also operated a detention facility just north of Windhoek, where it interned captured PLAN insurgents. Temporary Koevoet encampments and bases were strung along the border, and in some cases the unit shared a partitioned base with the civil police or the SADF. Koevoet was organised with a disproportionate emphasis on small unit tactics and most of its engagements were fought at the platoon or section level. The unit was structured into 24 platoon-sized fighting groups, which each received the prefix Zulu. The Zulu teams were designated alphabetically from A to Y and an individual team was identified by its letter's corresponding code in the NATO phonetic alphabet (i.e. Zulu Alpha). A team was usually composed of 40 black Ovambo constables and no more than 4 white officers. The team was led by a warrant officer and further divided into sections led by sergeants, which were capable of operating autonomously. While in the field, the sections were accompanied by a support element which handled logistics and intelligence. Each team had four Casspir mine-protected armoured vehicles, all of which carried ten passengers. Most of the Koevoet operators in a section remained mounted in the vehicles, but others proceeded ahead on foot and watched the ground for insurgent tracks. Operators were paid a bounty (known informally as a kopgeld) for every insurgent they killed or captured. Smaller bounties were also awarded for captured PLAN weapons, based on their condition and lethality. The bounty for a captured insurgent varied anywhere from 2,000 to 20,000 rand. In 1985, Koevoet had about 1,000 personnel under arms. Between 700 and 800 of the Koevoet operators serving in 1985 were black Namibians drawn from the local population in Ovamboland. The remainder were black recruits from other regions and white officers, predominantly South Africans. Relatively few local whites were recruited into Koevoet because the SAP and later SWAPOL faced stiff competition from the military for suitable white Namibian officer candidates. A handful of white Rhodesian exiles were recruited as officers during the early 1980s as well as some Angolans of Ovambo origin who joined the enlisted ranks. Koevoet did not have dedicated operational medics, and all of those serving with the unit were from the South African Medical Service, a branch of the SADF. By early 1989, Koevoet had almost tripled in size to about 3,000 personnel. Over the course of that year, it was reduced in size to about 1,600 personnel, a figure which remained more or less consistent between April and September 1989. Most of the Koevoet operators removed from the unit were given new assignments or demobilised. At the time of its disbandment in October 1989, Koevoet numbered only about 400 men. Uniforms and equipment Each Koevoet fighting team adopted stylised shoulder patches and T-shirts depicting a mascot animal. Some of the patches also included an illustration of a broken insurgent AK-47 rifle. While on operations, Koevoet personnel dressed light and informally. Individual operators wore a wide variety of uniforms with little consistency, including SAP camouflage, SWAPOL camouflage, and brown SADF fatigues. Late in the war, Koevoet adopted an olive green uniform and green canvas boots to distinguish itself from other police units and the SADF. Like the insurgents, Koevoet operators carried their ammunition in chest webbing rigs; this load-carrying tactic was favoured as it was less likely to restrict movement when moving through thick vegetation. The standard issue weapon in the unit was the Vektor R4 and Vektor R5 rifles, although some operators also carried captured PLAN Kalashnikov-pattern rifles. Koevoet sections were also issued support weapons during operations, namely the FN MAG general-purpose machine gun and the M79 grenade launcher. A few sections had access to Milkor MGLs or captured PLAN RPG-7s. Koevoet initially possessed no vehicles aside from three Hippo armoured personnel carriers, which were designed to be blastproof and mine- resistant. As Koevoet was accustomed to fighting on foot, there was a distinct lack of enthusiasm for vehicle-borne operations. However, in time the unit's leadership opted to modify the Hippos essentially as infantry fighting vehicles and integrate them into Koevoet teams to increase their mobility. Koevoet Hippos were open-topped, as the hull roofs made the vehicles too hot for the extreme temperatures in Ovamboland and degraded situational awareness. Interior water tanks were also fitted, as well as additional rifle racks and turrets for heavy weapons. The Hippos were initially mounted with general- purpose machine guns, such as FN MAGs, captured PLAN PKMs, and Browning M1919s. In time, some were fitted with ZPU-2 anti-aircraft guns and even a French variant of the 20mm MG 151 cannon. After 1980, the Casspir replaced the Hippo in Koevoet service, and weapon mounts became more standardised. Most Koevoet Casspirs were armed with a .50 calibre Browning M2 heavy machine gun on the hull roof, directly behind the driver's compartment. Ten Casspirs were fitted with 20mm cannon in lieu of the heavy machine gun, and a few section commanders replaced the single Browning with a twin mount for two general- purpose machine guns. It was not uncommon for Casspirs, like the Hippos, to be armed with M1919s or captured PKMs as auxiliary support weapons. Very late in the war, the Casspir was complemented in Koevoet service by the WMF Wolf Turbo, a similar vehicle optimised for Namibian conditions. Some Casspirs and Wolf Turbos were equipped with a mount for a 60mm mortar on the hull roof; this was used for suppressing ambushes. Tactics Koevoet's tactics were shaped in response to PLAN efforts to create insecurity in South West Africa's northern districts. An integral part of PLAN's strategy was to organise insurgent cells in the region, which could effectively harass the security forces and politically indoctrinate the population to undermine the South African administration and later, the South African-sponsored government of national unity. The emphasis on politicisation by PLAN insurgents was the result of their training in the Soviet Union and other socialist states, which was not confined to tactical instruction but extended to the procedures for establishing a covert political-military infrastructure within enemy-held areas. Aside from political activities, PLAN sabotaged rural infrastructure, namely power lines. The insurgents also laid land mines along known military patrol routes to hinder South African convoys. Koevoet's response was twofold: firstly, the unit carried out patrols to intercept PLAN insurgents near the Namibian border before they could get any further into the country itself. Secondly, it carried out what were essentially counter-intelligence operations aimed at compiling intelligence about PLAN activities while breaking up that movement's own intelligence network. Half of Koevoet's manpower was on patrol at any given time. The unit's headquarters at Oshakati identified areas where the likelihood of a PLAN presence was the greatest, and dispatched teams to patrol these districts in search of the insurgents. Koevoet operators obtained their intelligence by observing suspicious tracks or interrogating the local population. Each patrol lasted between one and two weeks. The teams either spent the night in SADF and police camps or slept in the bush. It was standard procedure to circle villages in the area and study the tracks to determine if there were any recent signs of unusual activity. After the patrol was over, the team spent a week resting, retraining, and maintaining its equipment in base while another was dispatched to take its place. Telltale cues in the environment indicating suspicious activity, including tracks and other signs, were known as spoor, an Afrikaans hunting term. Koevoet trackers were trained to scrutinise their environment down to the smallest detail, such as observing where dust had been disturbed on fallen leaves. The trackers walked or ran ahead of the remainder of the team, which followed in the vehicles, a tactic which Koevoet adopted in 1980. Occasionally Koevoet would be able to plot the insurgents' route after following their tracks; a section would then be dispatched ahead in an attempt to cut them off or intimidate them by firing its weapons. The purpose of this tactic was to sow panic among the insurgents, who would leave more obvious tracks and discard equipment as they attempted to outdistance their pursuers. If the spoor was lost, the trackers would be joined by others who dismounted from the vehicles and walked in a staggered line while they attempted to recover the spoor. The trackers frequently shouted clues and instructions to each other as they advanced. When they became exhausted, they were permitted to ride in the vehicles, and a fresh detachment of trackers dismounted to take their place. It was not uncommon for spoor to be followed for days on end. The longest distance a Koevoet team followed a single spoor without interruption was 185 kilometres. In many cases, the insurgents would attempt to ambush the team if they became aware of the pursuit. Koevoet trackers were usually able to discern that an ambush was imminent by studying the growing concentration of tracks, and in this event the team would circle the suspected ambush area in its vehicles, laying down suppressive fire. On other occasions, they would attempted to suppress the suspected ambush with mortars. Koevoet's counter-intelligence activities were equally effective, largely because the unit was more in contact with the civilian population at the local grassroots level, and unlike the intelligence organs of the SADF, was organised specifically with unconventional (i.e. counter-insurgency) warfare in mind. Koevoet was able to wage a successful irregular campaign against PLAN using \\"pseudo guerrillas\\", operators attired in PLAN uniforms who carried captured Soviet weapons. This helped sow suspicion in the ranks of the real insurgents and leave their informants uncertain as to whether any insurgent was a real PLAN fighter; it thus undermined PLAN's capacity to conduct politicisation programmes within local communities. The \\"pseudo guerrilla\\" programme was a closely guarded secret until Koevoet was compelled by the Namibian courts to disclose some details during the trial of Jonas Paulus in 1983. Allegations of war crimes While Koevoet had an exceptional combat record in Namibia‚Äîduring the final decade of the war it killed a little over 2,800 insurgents and captured another 463 while suffering 151 casualties‚Äîit also cultivated a reputation for being particularly brutal and ruthless, as well as being indifferent towards the SADF's rules of engagement. Over the course of the South African Border War, PLAN accused Koevoet of committing numerous human rights violations, especially extrajudicial killings and assassinations. Koevoet was accused of mistreating detainees and prisoners, subjecting them to various forms of torture, including physical assault, electric shocks, and sleep, food, and water deprivation. The unit did operate its own detention facility, where it held some prisoners indefinitely. The detainees included captured insurgents as well as any civilian suspected of possessing vital information related to PLAN activities. In 1986, the Namibian courts ruled that as all the Koevoet's detainees had been arrested by a police unit as common law criminals, they were entitled to legal representation within a period of thirty days. Koevoet later subverted this ruling by evoking the Terrorism Act. Two especially contentious issues which emerged with regards to Koevoet was the common practice of displaying corpses of dead insurgents on the unit's Casspirs, and the use of \\"pseudo-guerrilla\\" forces. During the early 1980s, SWAPOL and the SADF issued vehement denials that the enemy dead were being publicly exhibited, and warned that members of the security forces who indulged in such behaviour would be prosecuted. In December 1986, photographs were leaked to the international press which displayed two dead insurgents draped over the hull of a Koevoet Casspir. Koevoet claimed that the insurgents were not being exhibited, but simply being carried back to base, presumably for the purpose of claiming kopgeld, stating that it was impractical to store the corpses inside the Casspirs due to the vehicles' limited internal stowage space. PLAN insisted that Koevoet's \\"pseudo-guerrilla\\" forces were being used to carry out atrocities later attributed to insurgents. The most controversial incident allegedly involving \\"pseudo-guerrillas\\" was the murder of a family of 8 Ovambo civilians at Oshipanda. The civilians were shot with Kalashnikov rifles, and their home had been burgled. A man who escaped the massacre claimed to have recognised a Koevoet constable among the assailants. Koevoet and the civil police blamed PLAN for the killings. Perceptions of Koevoet's human rights record among the SADF's general staff were almost universally critical. General Constand Viljoen, who served as Chief of the SADF between 1980 and 1985, claimed that Koevoet operators \\"had a cruelty about them that certainly didn't further the hearts and minds of the people....they used cruel, cruel, methods\\". His successor, General Johannes Geldenhuys, was no less scathing: \\"[Koevoet] would, for example, go into an area, clean it up, then collect the bodies and drag them through town behind their vehicles. Obviously this kind of action upset the local population greatly and we'd find we were suddenly getting no more cooperation from the locals\\". General Georg Meiring, who served as chief of the South West African Territorial Force between 1983 and 1987, stated that \\"Koevoet was not a law unto itself, Koevoet was just unto itself...I hated working with them.\\" In 1996, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established to investigate human rights abuses committed in South Africa and Namibia under the apartheid system. The commission suggested that Koevoet carried out the Oshipanda murders, based on the account of the surviving eyewitness. It was favourably inclined towards PLAN's claims that Koevoet operators carried out atrocities during \\"pseudo-guerrilla\\" operations to discredit the insurgent cause. The commission alleged that rape by Koevoet operators \\"was common, and women and girls of all ages were victims\\", citing a report compiled by the Dutch faith-based organisation Kairos. It held Koevoet responsible for the summary execution of captured PLAN insurgents, including those who were wounded or otherwise incapacitated, and for the maltreatment of detainees at its internment facility.

Animation of side reins in use Side reins are equipment used when longeing a horse, running from the bit of the bridle to the saddle or surcingle. As a horse training tool, they encourage flexion and softness in the horse's mouth. For longe line work with a rider up who does not carry ordinary riding reins, they help calm and settle the animal. However, they are a tool best used by experienced handlers; used improperly they may unduly restrict the horse's movement or cause an accident. The Side Rein A set of side reins with elastic, buckle adjustment Side reins are made of leather or webbing, sometimes with added elastic, and have several rings or holes for buckles along their length. They are easily adjusted. Some designs have adjustable buckles and attach to the bit with a snap, other designs run through the bit ring, then fold back on themselves and snap to their own rings. Side reins may be completely of solid material, or they may have an elastic or rubber ring insert. Each design has its advantages and disadvantages. Designs with elastic have more \\"give\\" to them, which is useful for sensitive horses or horses that throw their heads. Elastic inserts must be used with caution, however, as some horses learn to lean on them. Solid side reins are the older, classical design, give the horse a more solid contact to work into and discourage leaning, but must be adjusted with greater care because their lack of give may upset a sensitive horse and, particularly if too tight, may provoke rearing, headshaking and even panic in some animals. Side reins with a rubber donut provide some give, although not as muct as elastic and so discourage leaning. However, they are heavier and are prone to bounce when the horse trots or canters, which does not provide as steady a contact as the solid or elastic-insert side reins. Uses of the Side Rein Elasticized side reins are often used with training young horses prior to being ridden. They help accustom a horse to the feel of pressure on the bit, and reward the horse when it gives or flexes to bit pressure. Solid side reins are usually used for more advanced horses. They give the horse something to take contact with, encourage balance and correct head carriage, help a horse develop self-carriage, and help stop a horse from over-bending in the neck. Adjustment of the Side Rein Side reins may be attached from the bit rings to the surcingle rings, or from the bit to the buckles of the girth of an English saddle or cinch rings of a western saddle. Side reins are adjusted longer for less-experienced horses, and gradually shortened and raised higher (from point of shoulder up to the point of hip) as a horse becomes better trained. Side reins should never be so short that the horse's head is pulled behind the vertical. For green horses, the side reins should be adjusted so that the horse's head is approximately 4 inches in front of the vertical and the side reins are attached at a point level with the point of the shoulder. As the horse becomes more advanced and more physically developed, the side reins may be shortened so the head is nearly vertical to the ground. Side reins should not pull the horse in‚Äîthey do NOT create collection. Rather, a properly longed horse will collect himself, and the shorter side reins will be the correct length for him to keep a contact with the bit. Short side reins should not be used for long periods of time. Side reins should usually be adjusted so they are the same length on each side, though in some cases, the inside rein may be slightly shorter, particularly with a horse that has previously been allowed to develop the habit of arcing its body away from the circle. It is considered correct to fasten the outside rein before the inside rein, similarly to the idea that a rider would take up outside contact before inside rein contact. It is best to make sure that both side reins are adjusted before attaching them to the bit, as it can be irritating to the horse to stand with one side rein attached while the handler is adjusting the other. Improper adjustment of side reins can cause a horse to go behind the bit, spoil the horse's training, and even cause the horse to feel trapped, leading to rearing and the possibility that the horse will flip over. When to Attach Side Reins A horse should always be warmed up and cooled down without the side reins, allowed to stretch long and low. When the side reins are first applied during a workout, they should be adjusted long and gradually shortened as the horse warms up into them. Side reins are only for work in the trot and canter. Working a horse in side reins at the walk, other than in brief transitions can spoil the gait by inhibiting forward motion. Side reins should not be used for jumping, as they restrict the use of the neck too much, and may even cause the horse to fall. The Sliding Side Rein/Lauffer Rein The sliding side rein. These are adjusted with the side reins attaching between the legs. The sliding side rein gives a bit more freedom to the horse than the standard side rein. It attaches from a lower ring on the surcingle, through the bit ring, and back up to an upper ring on the surcingle. This allows the horse to stretch down and lower his head while still maintaining contact with the bit, and are therefore useful on horses that are tight in the back, carry their head too high, or are learning to stretch forward and down for the bit contact. Like the side rein, the lauffer rein is adjusted so that the horse has contact with it when his head is at or just in front of the vertical. Green horses should have the lauffer rein attached to a lower and middle surcingle rein, while more advanced horses can have the reins raised to a middle and high ring on the surcingle. The sliding side rein was designed to be attached to the outside rings of the surcingle, not between the legs. Running the reins between the legs can encourage a horse to get behind the bit and overflex.

The statue was originally proposed to be built at Holmes Peak in southeastern Osage County, located about 7 miles (11 km) northwest of downtown Tulsa and the highest point in the immediate region with an altitude of 1030 ft (314 m). The site was within the grounds of Tulsa's Centennial Botanical Garden (now called the Tulsa Botanic Garden). According to the proposal, The American, designed in the image of an American Indian brave with a bald eagle on his shoulder, will rise 60 ft (20 m) taller than the Statue of Liberty, and will be the largest bronze statue in the world with an interior observation deck. The eagle will have an 82 ft (25 m) wingspan. Gray, who is Osage, and has built a career on large-scale sculptures of Oklahoman sports figures such as New York Yankees pitcher Allie \\"Superchief\\" Reynolds and Heisman trophy winner Billy Vessels, conceived The American as an entry for a contest to design a statue for the dome of the Oklahoma State Capitol, which was added to the building in 2001. Initially intended for the outskirts of Oklahoma City, the Tulsa location was selected after investor disinterest. The design was enlarged for the landmark Holmes Peak site and for visitor access, and will include a visitor center and other amenities and underground access to the statue, rather than directly at the base, to preserve the natural setting. According to a statement by developers in Spring 2007, the project was anticipated to break ground in late 2007 and be completed in 2011. It was originally intended for the 100th anniversary of Oklahoma's admission as a U.S. state in 1907. However, as of 2016, the project remained unbuilt. In April 2011, the Osage Nation appropriated $2.5 million as a potential contribution toward the project, but the tribe's investment entity then decided not to accept the appropriation.Benny Polacca, \\"Osage LLC turns down $2.5 million appropriation for The American statue project\\" , Osage News, May 4, 2011.

Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 684 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 926 in 2009 and 2,127 in 2010. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011‚Äì2015 categorized it as a general aviation facility (the commercial service category requires at least 2,500 enplanements per year). Cape Air is the current airline, averaging 900 to 1,000 passengers per month on three daily round trips to St. Louis Lambert International Airport Clarence Cannon Memorial Terminal at Kirksville Regional Airport.  History  Aviation in the Kirksville area began within a few years of the Wright brothers flight. Local resident Nick Sparling is credited as being Adair County's first aviator, in 1909. In 1924, Roy B. \\"Cap\\" Dodson started the first airport in the area, located on the north edge of Kirksville. However, an airfield at the present location of Kirksville Regional Airport wasn't created until 1930 when the Federal Aviation Administration built a series of emergency landing strips across the nation. With America's entry into World War II, the Kirksville Municipal Airport, as it had been declared in the late 1930s, received a major upgrade from the Civilian Pilots Training Program and the US Army Air Corps War Training Service. In 1942 a paved all-weather landing strip, hangars, a control tower and small restaurant were built; the paved runway was 3870 ft until 1968. The post-war boom in commercial aviation reached Kirksville in 1960 when Ozark Air Lines began scheduled flights. The plane was a familiar sight to many World War II veterans, as Ozark used the Douglas DC-3, the civil counterpart of the famed C-47 'Gooney Bird', now in Ozark's white and evergreen instead of Army Air Corps colors. The Ozark route began in Kansas City to Chicago with stops in Kirksville, Ottumwa and Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Moline, Illinois. Airport improvements came after a bond issue was approved by Kirksville voters in 1967. A new six-thousand foot concrete runway was built, as well as a new terminal building and improved hangar facilities. The longer runway was needed for the faster Fairchild prop-jet that began flights to Kirksville in late 1968. Also in the 1960s, Ozark switched Kirksville service from a Kansas City-Chicago route to a Des Moines-to-St. Louis one. With the airport improvements came a new name, Clarence Cannon Memorial Airport‚Äîchosen to honor long-time US Congressman Clarence Cannon of Missouri who had done much to help secure air service and funding for the airport. Despite nearly a million dollars in facility upgrades and a steady flow of passengers in and out of Kirksville, Ozark Airlines found the route to be financially untenable by the mid-1970s, with their final departure coming on April 23, 1976. Fortunately a local pilot and dentist, Dr. Stephen Barber, has established a small commuter air service, Horizon Airways, in 1972. Horizon was able to help fill the void left by Ozarks departure, eventually expanding to five aircraft and service to both Kansas City and St. Louis.A History Of Adair County Missouri published by the Kirksville-Adair County Bicentennial Committee, 1976.'Flying High!' by Tony Frost & Corey Pritchard, published in The Chariton Collector magazine Spring, 1987. Air Choice One began scheduled flight operations twice daily, to and from Lambert-St. Louis International Airport during July 2009. Scheduled operations are currently subsidized by the Essential Air Service Act. Previously service was operated by Air Midwest (operating as US Airways Express) to Kansas City International Airport and by RegionsAir (operating as American Connection) with flights to Lambert-St. Louis International Airport. In September, 2010 Cape Air replaced Air Choice One.  Facilities The airport covers 476 acres (193 ha) at an elevation of 966 feet (294 m). It has two runways: 18/36 is 6,005 by 100 feet (1,830 x 30 m) concrete; 9/27 is 1,370 by 100 feet (418 x 30 m) turf. In the year ending June 30, 2010 the airport had 5,625 aircraft operations, average 15 per day: 62% general aviation, 21% airline, 13% air taxi, 4% military. 35 aircraft were then based at the airport: 83% single-engine, 11% multi-engine, and 6% helicopter.  Airline and destination Scheduled passenger service:  Incidents  * On October 19, 2004, Corporate Airlines Flight 5966 crashed on approach to Kirksville. Thirteen individuals died and two sustained injuries. The National Transportation Safety Board determined pilot error to be the cause of the accident. * On May 12, 2005 a Midwest Airlines Boeing 717 made an emergency landing at Kirksville Regional Airport after experiencing severe turbulence while en route from Kansas City, Missouri to Washington, D.C. A safe landing was made, with all 76 passengers and 4 crew unharmed. To date this is the largest aircraft to ever land at Kirksville Regional Airport. * On November 5, 2013 American business executive Robert Groh, President of Geo- Syntheics, LLC, and an instructor pilot were killed when their plane crashed on final approach to Kirksville Regional Airport. The plane, a Piper PA-32 Saratoga, went down in a rural area of Adair County approximately 2.5 miles northeast of the runway shortly after a radio check-in with airport personnel. At that time the pilot reported no difficulties. The plane was on a cross- country flight from Centennial Airport near Denver, Colorado to Waukesha, Wisconsin, the home city for Geo-Syntheics.

It was one of the original six towns that federated to form the city. Tunstall is the most northern, and fourth largest town of the Potteries. It is situated in the very northwest of the city borough, with its north and west boundaries being the city limit. It stands on a ridge of land between Fowlea Brook to the west and Scotia Brook to the east, surrounded by old tile making and brick making sites, some of which date back to the Middle Ages. History There is no independent record of Tunstall in the Domesday Book; it is believed to have formed part of the lands of Richard the forester, centred on Thursfield.Domesday Book entry for Thursfield However, Tunstall Manor quickly became powerful. Between 1212 and 1273, Tunstall, Bemersley, Burslem, Chatterley, Chell, Oldcott, and Thursfield, Whitfield and Bemersley are mentioned as distinct manors or vills; all but Chell had merged within the manor of Tunstall by the end of the 13th century. From the 16th century, Tunstall Manor covered an area which extended to the Cheshire border and included the following additional townships: Chell, Ravenscliffe, Sneyd, Brieryhurst, Stadmorslow and Wedgwood.Tunstall ‚Äì Manors Records mention that iron and coal was being mined and processed in the town as far back as 1282.Tunstall ‚Äì Economic History The appointment of a market-reeve by the manor court in 1525 is the earliest indication of a market in Tunstall manor. In 1816, a market square of nearly an acre (now Tower Square) was laid out on land called Stony Croft which was leased from the lord of the manor, and small-scale markets began to be held. Today, Tunstall Market is the smallest of the four markets in Stoke-on-Trent (Fenton and Burslem not having markets).Stoke Markets High Street, Tunstall Tunstall remained a linear village until the industrial revolution. Tunstall's main make-up is now of rows of Victorian terraced houses, which were a built during the pottery boom to house workers. There are a number of new estates that have been built in the area. Park Terrace consists of elegant Victorian and Edwardian town houses and is a designated conservation area, as is the housing around Victoria Park.Stoke City Council Conservation Areas The town was granted Urban District Council status in 1894 and quickly set about expanding itself, acquiring amongst others Pitts Hill from Chell civil parish in 1899.Tunstall ‚Äì Local Government On 1 April 1910, the UDC dissolved itself and the town was federated into the county borough of Stoke-on-Trent. By 1925 the borough was granted city status. Tunstall has however, remained distinct and retained its own shopping and business district, adding to Stoke-on-Trent's polycentric nature. On 27 November 1916, German Zeppelin LZ 61 (L21) bombed Tunstall during its return leg to Germany, dropping three bombs.

Thus Tunstall was not affected by the 1842 Pottery Riots. However, Tunstall still has a rich industrial heritage. At the start of the 19th century there were 3 pottery works in the town, by the close of the century that number had risen to 13. Famous potters located in the town have been the Adams dynasty of potters founded by William Adams, as well as Alfred Meakin, Booths founded by Enoch Booth and Enoch Wedgwood. Robert Beswick, father of Beswick Pottery founder James Wright Beswick, began making pottery in Tunstall. Jabez Vodrey is a noted emigrant potter, the first English potter west of the Appalachian Mountains. Clarice Cliff (20 January 1899 ‚Äì 23 October 1972) was an English ceramic industrial artist active from 1922 to 1963. Charles Shaw was a 19th- century potter who's in-depth autobiography has given some of the clearest insights into the Victorian Potteries, and provided Arnold Bennett with inspiration for his Clayhanger novels.Charles Shaw's Autobiography Tunstall became widely known for its tiles, regarded to be as good as slate. Decorative ceramic tiles are still made in Tunstall by H and R Johnson-Richards Tiles Ltd. Transport Tunstall's industries were served by the Trent and Mersey Canal, constructed over 11 years from 1766. The canal was designed by James Brindley, resident of Turnhurst Hall in nearby Chell. Just north of Tunstall lies one of Brindley's greatest achievements, the Harecastle Tunnel, which takes the Trent and Mersey Canal underneath Goldenhill. Barges were 'legged' through by men lying on their backs on top of the barges and pushing against the roof with their feet. This was a physically demanding and slow, causing major delays, so in 1827 leading civil engineer Thomas Telford was commissioned to provide a second, and wider, parallel tunnel with a towpath. Today the Harecastle Tunnels are the fourth longest canal tunnels in the UK. Tunstall was served by a railway station, which was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway on 1 December 1873. This closed under the Beeching Axe in 1965 with the removal of the Potteries Loop Line. Today Tunstall lies roughly equidistant between Longport and Kidsgrove railway stations on the Stafford to Manchester Line, a branch of the West Coast Main Line (Network Rail Route 18). There are also direct services to Crewe and Derby. It is also well served by buses provided by: Baker Coaches, Clowes Coaches, D&G; Coaches, Wardle Transport and First Potteries, connecting Tunstall to all surrounding settlements. The A50 is the main arterial route through Tunstall, running from Warrington to Leicester via Stoke and Derby. Tunstall is linked to the A500 \\"D-road\\", which passes just west of the town, by the new A527 linkway the town connecting Tunstall and the rest of Stoke-on-Trent to the M6 motorway.

Tunstall has had a rise in well-known shops in recent years, notably with the construction of Alexandra Retail Park.Dransfield Properties Ltd ‚Äì Alexandra Park, Tunstall, Stoke on Trent These developments have, however, been felt to be to the detriment of Tunstall's traditional town centre shops and market.

A recognisable Tunstall, renamed Turnhill, features in the novels of Arnold Bennett.Arnold Bennett's Tunstall Christ Church, Tunstall Tunstall library and public baths There are a number of Grade II listed buildings in Tunstall, notably: Tunstall Market Hall, Tunstall Town Hall, Christ Church, Church of the Sacred Heart, the world's first Primitive Methodist chapel, the Clock Tower in Tower Square, Tunstall library & public baths, Victoria Park and structures, and the Lodge & canal portals at Harecastle Tunnel.Tunstall's Listed Buildings There are also three conservation areas: Tower Square, Park Terrace and Victoria Park & surrounding housing.Stoke-on-Trent City Council Conservation Areas By closing years of the 19th century, most urban areas in the UK were suffering from pollution and poor health. To this end Tunstall Urban district began a series of improvements works shortly after its foundation, including the Victoria Public Baths- opened in 1897. In this year, work commenced on Victoria Park, also known as Tunstall Park. The park was devised by the council's architect Absalom Reade Wood (1851‚Äì1922). By 1914 the park had largely taken its present form, covering 21 acres. It is now Grade II listed.Parks And Gardens UK ‚Äì Tunstall/Victoria Park History Tunstall Victoria Park Trust, a registered charity, was founded in 2009 to engage the public and help decide how the money donated by the Reginald Johnson Foundation for improving the park should be used.Tunstall Victoria Park Trust The Golden Torch, on Hose Street, was a famous Northern Soul club, founded by Christopher Burton, a contemporary of Ivor Abadi (founder of the Twisted Wheel club), and Russ Winstanley of the famous Wigan Casino. It opened on 30 January 1965 with the headline act of Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas. Initially a mod club, it did not begin regular soul nights until 1969. It played host to DJs such as Peter Stringfellow. Following the closure of Manchester's Twisted Wheel soul club, in 1971 The Torch began putting on its own Soul All-Nighters. However, it became a victim of its own success, with regular police presences, drug taking and over crowding. When the club came to renew its licence on 16 March 1973 Stoke-on-Trent council refused the renewal, without a licence the club simply fizzled out, paving the way for the Wigan Casino.The Golden Torch The Tunstall Wakes were held on the first Sunday after the feast of St. Margaret (20 July), the saint to whom Wolstanton church is dedicated. The wakes were abolished in 1879, but soon revived by popular demand.Tunstall ‚Äì Social History Tunstall was home to the independent Frink School of Figurative Sculpture, which occupied a fine old factory (and former Old Court) in Roundwell Street for a number of years until about 2004. The Frink School was named after Elisabeth Frink, British sculptress, and was a small intimate academy with a specific discipline of study closer in spirit to a master and apprentice structure than an educational institution. This has since moved to nearby Leek.Create Stoke Interview with Rosemary Barnett, head of The Frink School of Figurative Sculpture Today, the area is served by many primary schools, and secondary schools include The Co-operative Academy of Stoke-on- Trent, Ormiston Horizon Academy and St Margaret Ward Catholic Academy. Regeneration Dransfield created Jasper Square which is occupied by stores including Next, Argos and Matalan. The company later began construction on a project called Alexandra Park adjacent to the previous project. The park contains a Primary Care Centre, Boots, Carphone Warehouse and DW Health and Fitness Club. The final phase of development was completed in February 2014 and added Home Bargains, Iceland and Card Factory. The park contains \\"The Shard\\", a stainless steel sculpture celebrating the area's historic pottery industry. It was created by Robert Erskine. In 2014, long-term plans for another retail park and Morrisons supermarket were cancelled. The landmark HSBC bank on the high street was bought over by digital marketing agency Netinspire and insolvency practitioner Dunion & Co.

By 1998, the church had relocated to ‚Äì and outgrown ‚Äì numerous buildings until reaching its current location at 920 Blankenbaker Parkway in Louisville. Former Senior Minister Bob Russell retired in 2006 after 40 years of service. He was succeeded as senior minister by Dave Stone, the longtime preaching associate at Southeast. In February 2007, Southeast Christian officially released an announcement that it would establish a satellite church in Clark County, Indiana.Southeast Christian to add site in Indiana With the establishment of a second location, Southeast became a multi-site church. The breaking of the ground, by I-65 Exit 4 in Jeffersonville, Indiana, took place on August 12, 2007,\\"Supersized Worship.\\" The Courier-Journal, November 26, 2006, page B2. and the church officially opened on April 12, 2009. On February 8, 2009, the church announced the plans for its third location. The Oldham County Campus, in Crestwood, Kentucky, held its first service in January 2011. In 2009, Southeast also opened up a new youth building called \\"The Block\\". On the weekend of June 30/July 1, 2012, the church announced that it would develop a fourth campus in southwest Jefferson County, near Dixie Highway (US 31W) and adjacent to the southwestern campus of Christian Academy of Louisville. This site was originally expected to open in fall 2013, but groundbreaking was delayed until February 2013; the new campus opened in time for Easter 2014. The next satellite campus was found in an old movie theatre in LaGrange, Kentucky in January 2017, making this the 5th campus to launch. In 2017, a satellite campus opened in Elizabethtown, Kentucky. The church also opened a campus in Prospect, Kentucky in 2019. In September of 2019, the church announced a campus in Shelby County, Kentucky would be built, and in January of 2020, the church announced a campus in Bullitt County, Kentucky would be built. In March of 2020 Southeast moved to virtual worship in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Services were held online for the proceeding weeks. The church‚Äôs campuses would eventually regather 4th of July weekend in-person while following CDC guidelines.

The company is headquartered in Burlingame, California. It is the oldest continuously family-owned chocolate company in the United States, having been family-owned for more than four generations. History Guittard Chocolate was founded by Etienne \\"Eddy\\" Guittard (1838‚Äì1899), who immigrated to the United States from Lyon, France, in the 1850s during the California Gold Rush. He brought French chocolates with him, which he traded for supplies. After trying without success for three years to strike gold in the Sierra, he returned to San Francisco, where shopkeepers with whom he had earlier traded his chocolate convinced him to become a chocolate maker. He then returned to Paris, saved money to buy the equipment he needed, before returning to San Francisco and opening his business at 405 Sansome Street on the San Francisco waterfront. Initially, he also sold items such as, tea, coffee and spices alongside his chocolate. Horace C. Guittard, √âtienne's son, was in charge when the 1906 San Francisco earthquake destroyed the city. In the aftermath of the quake, a new plant was built on Commercial Street. The company expanded in 1921 and 1936 onto property on Main Street south of Market. In 1954, Guittard sold its property to the city so that Embarcadero Freeway could be built. The company relocated to a facility at the corner of Guittard and Rollins road in Burlingame, California, where it is still located today. Gary Guittard began working full-time at the company in 1975. He replaced Horace A. Guittard (his father) in 1989, becoming president and CEO. Pieces of Guittard bittersweet chocolate Products The company produces cocoa, chocolate syrup, milk chocolate balls and eggs, baking chips, as well as mints and mint wafers. 85% of Guittard's clients are food industry professionals, while 15% are pastry chefs. Customers include See's Candies, Kellogg's, Baskin-Robbins, Recchiuti Confections, Garrison Confections, and Williams Sonoma. The company also sells to chef Donald Wressel and has recently developed a variety of chocolate bars specifically designed for amateur bakers.  Social responsibility  Gary Guittard remains committed to his grandfather's goal of supporting the local community. He provides financial support to educational and charitable organizations, such as the San Francisco Boys and Girls Club, and also spearheads the company's Cultivate Better initiative. The company is also a founding member of the World Cocoa Foundation and is an International Cocoa Initiative Member. Both organizations aim to improve cocoa farm practices around the world through education, training, and development for cocoa farmers.

Traditionally tonnage and poundage was granted by Parliament to the king for life, but this practice did not continue into the reign of Charles I. Tonnage and poundage were swept away by the Customs and Excise Act 1787. History Charles I's first parliament, known as the Useless Parliament, broke with tradition and granted the king tonnage and poundage for a year rather than life out of concern over the manner in which tonnage and poundage's life grant of 1604 had been used by James to justify impositions, which were additional duties imposed on certain items. This restriction was seen as a provocative step by Parliament as it was one of the King's main sources of revenue, and Parliament intended the one-year limit to curb Charles' autonomy by forcing him to request money from Parliament every year thereafter. Although the House of Commons passed this bill, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham led a successful effort in the House of Lords to block it. As a result, Parliament granted Charles no tonnage and poundage rights at all, which, combined with Parliament's efforts to impeach the Duke of Buckingham, led to Charles' first parliament being dissolved. Charles, however, continued to collect unauthorised tonnage and poundage duties, and this action became a chief complaint of Charles' failed parliament of 1629. When Charles moved to adjourn the parliament, members held the speaker, John Finch, in his seat until three resolutions could be read, one of which declared anyone who paid unauthorised tonnage and poundage to be a betrayer and enemy of England. Impact Charles I's levying of tonnage and poundage without parliamentary sanction continued to be one of the complaints of his Long Parliament. The refusal of and subsequent disputes about tonnage and poundage rights is seen as one of the many events bearing responsibility for the English Civil War.

The compound contains polyene, polyyne, and alcohol functional groups and is a structural isomer of oenanthotoxin, also found in water dropwort. Both of these belong to the C17-polyacetylenes chemical class. It causes death by respiratory paralysis resulting from disruption of the central nervous system. It is a potent, noncompetitive antagonist of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor. In humans, cicutoxin rapidly produces symptoms of nausea, emesis and abdominal pain, typically within 60 minutes of ingestion. This can lead to tremors, seizures, and death. LD50(mouse; i.p.) ~9 mg/kg History Johann Jakob Wepfer's book Cicutae Aquaticae Historia Et Noxae Commentario Illustrata was published in 1679; it contains the earliest published report of toxicity associated with Cicuta plants. The name cicutoxin was coined by Boehm in 1876 for the toxic compound arising from the plant Cicuta virosa, and he also extracted and named the isomeric toxin oenanthotoxin from Oenanthe crocata. A review published in 1911 examined 27 cases of cicutoxin poisoning, 21 of which had resulted in death - though some of these cases involved deliberate poisoning. This review included a case where a family of five used Cicuta extracts as a topical treatment for itching, resulting in the deaths of two children, a report that suggests that cicutoxin may be absorbed through the skin. A review from 1962 examined 78 cases, 33 of which resulted in death, and cases of cicutoxin poisoning continue to occur: *A child used the stem of a plant as a toy whistle and died of cicutoxin poisoning *A 14-year-old boy died 20 hours after consuming a 'wild carrot' in 2001 *In 1992, two brothers were foraging for wild ginseng and found a hemlock root. One of them ate three bites of the supposed ginseng root and the other one ingested one bite. The first brother died three hours later while the second made a full recovery with supportive medical care after experiencing seizures and delirium. All plants from the genus Cicuta contain cicutoxin. These plants are found in swampy, wet habitats in North America and parts of Europe. The Cicuta plants are often mistaken for edible roots such as parsnip, wild carrot or wild ginseng. All parts of the Cicuta plants are poisonous, though the root is the most toxic part of the plant and toxin levels are highest in spring - ingestion of a 2‚Äì3 cm portion of root can be fatal to adults. In one reported incident, 17 boys ingested parts of the plant, with only those who consumed the root experiencing seizures whilst those who consumed only leaves and flowers merely became unwell. The toxicity of the plants depends on various factors, such as seasonal variation, temperature, geographical location and soil conditions. The roots remain toxic even after drying. Plants containing cicutoxin Cicuta virosa, Mackenzie's water hemlock Cicutoxin is found in five species of water hemlock, all belonging to the family Apiaceae. These include all four species in the genus Cicuta and one species from the genus Oenanthe: the bulblet-bearing water hemlock, C. bulbifera; the Douglas water hemlock, C. douglasii; the spotted water hemlock or spotted cowbane, C. maculata; Mackenzie's water hemlock, C. virosa; and, the water dropwort, O. crocata. Cicutoxin is found in all parts of these plants, along with several other C17 polyactylenes. C. virosa, for example, produces isocicutoxin, a geometric isomer of cicutoxin, while O. crocata contains the toxin oenanthotoxin, a structural isomer of cicutoxin. Cicuta plants also produce multiple congeners of cicutoxin, such as such as Virol A and Virol C. Chemistry Building on Boehm's work, Jacobsen reported the first isolation of pure cicutoxin as a yellowish oil in 1915. Its chemical structure was not determined until 1953, however, when it was shown that it has a molecular formula of C17H22O2 and it is an aliphatic, highly unsaturated alcohol with two triple bonds conjugated with three double bonds, and two hydroxyl groups. The first synthesis of cicutoxin was reported in 1955. Though the overall yield was only 4% and the product was the racemic mixture, the synthesis has been described as \\"a significant accomplishment\\" given that it was achieved \\"without the benefit of modern coupling reactions.\\" The absolute configuration of the naturally-occurring form of cicutoxin was reported in 1999 to be (R)-(‚àí)-cicutoxin, systematically named as (8E,10E,12E,14R)-heptadeca-8,10,12-triene-4,6-diyne-1,14-diol. Outside of a plant, cicutoxin breaks down when exposed to air, light, or heat, making it difficult to handle. Cicutoxin has a long carbon structure and few hydrophilic substituents which gives it hydrophobic characteristics. Hydrophobic and/or small molecules can be absorbed through the skin. Research has shown that cicutoxin will pass through the skin of frogs and the experience of the family who used a Cicuta plant as a topical antipruritic strongly suggests that the compound is able to pass through human skin. =Laboratory synthesis= The first total synthesis of racemic cicutoxin was published in 1955 and reported that this racemate was about twice as active as the naturally-occurring enantiomer. A complete synthesis of the natural product, (R)-(‚Äì)-cicutoxin, in four linear steps was reported in 1999, from three key fragments: (R)-(‚Äì)-1-hexyn-3-ol (8), 1,4-diiodo-1,3-butadiene (9), and THP-protected 4,6-heptadiyn-1-ol (6). (R)-(‚Äì)-1-hexyn-3-ol (8) is a known compound and was obtained by Corey-Bakshi-Shibata reduction of 1-hexyn-3-one. 1,4-diiodo-1,3-butadiene (9) is also a known compound and it is readily available by dimerization of acetylene accompanied by addition of iodine in the presence of platinum (IV) catalyst and sodium iodide. The last keyfragment, THP-protected 4,6-heptadiyn-1-ol (6) is a known compound. The first step is the Sonogashira coupling of compound 8 and 9. This step gave dienynol (10) with 63 percent yield. The second step is a palladium -catalyzed coupling reaction. The coupling of compound 6 and 10 leads to the 17-carbon frame (11) with 74 percent yield. Compound 11 already has the stereo center in place and only needs a few structural changes: the third and fourth step. The third step is the reduction of the C5 triple bond in compound 11, this was accomplished by using a compound called Red-Al. The last step is the removal of the THP protection group. When THP is removed and a hydrogen is bound to the oxygen, then (R)-(‚Äì)-cicutoxin is formed. These four steps are the full synthesis of cicutoxin and gives an overall yield of 18 percent. Biochemistry Cicutoxin is known to interact with the GABAA receptor and it also has been shown to block the potassium channel in T lymphocytes. A similar effect where potassium channels in neurons are blocked could account for the toxic effect on the nervous system. The interactions are explained in Mechanism of action. =Mechanism of action= The exact mechanism of action is not known for cicutoxin, even though it is well-known to be a violent toxin. The mechanism is not known because of the chemical instability of cicutoxin, but there have been studies that delivered some evidence for a mechanism of action. Cicutoxin is a noncompetitive gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonist in the central nervous system (CNS). GABA normally binds to the beta domain of the GABAA receptor and activates the receptor which causes a flow of chloride across the membrane. Cicutoxin binds to the same place as GABA, because of this the receptor is not activated by GABA. The pore of the receptor won't open and chloride can't flow across the membrane. Binding of cicutoxin to the beta domain also blocks the chloride channel. Both effects of cicutoxin on the GABAA-receptor cause a constant depolarization. This causes hyperactivity in cells, which leads to seizures. There also have been some studies that suggest that cicutoxin increases the duration of the neuronal repolarization in a dose-dependent manner. The toxin could increase the duration of the repolarization up to sixfold at 100 ¬µmol L‚àí1. The prolonged action potentials may cause higher excitatory activity. It has been demonstrated that cicutoxin also blocks potassium channels in T-lymphocytes. The toxin inhibits the proliferation of the lymphocytes . This has made it a substance of interest in research for a medicine against leukemia. =Metabolism= It is unknown how the body gets rid of cicutoxin. There is evidence that it has a long half-life in the body, because of a patient who was submitted in a hospital after eating a root of a Cicuta plant. The man was in the hospital for two days and still had a fuzzy feeling in his head two days after leaving the hospital. There is also the case of a sheep (discussed in Effects on animals) where the sheep fully recovered after seven days. This can also be explained by the structure of cicutoxin, it consists of 17 carbons, which is hydrophobic. It also has 3 double bonds, 2 triple bonds and two hydroxyl groups, which make the toxin very reactive and not easy to excrete. Poisoning=Symptoms= First signs of cicutoxin poisoning start 15‚Äì60 minutes after ingestion and are vomiting, convulsions, widened pupils, salivation, excess sweating and the patient may go into a coma. Other described symptoms are cyanosis, amnesia, absence of muscle reflexes, metabolic acidosis and cardiovascular changes which may cause heart problems and central nervous system problems which manifest themselves as convulsions and either an overactive or underactive heart. Due to an overactive nervous system respiratory failure occurs which may cause suffocation and accounts for most of the deaths. Dehydration from water loss due to vomiting can also occur. If untreated, the kidneys can also fail, causing death. =Treatment= The adverse effects from cicutoxin poisoning are gastrointestinal or cardiac nature. With no antidote known, only symptomatic treatments are available, though supportive treatments do substantially improve survival rates. Treatments used include the administration of activated charcoal within 30 minutes of ingestion to reduce the uptake of poison, maintaining open airways to prevent suffocation, rehydration to address the dehydration caused by vomiting, and administration of benzodiazepines that enhance the effect of GABA on the GABAA receptor or barbiturates to reduce seizures. =Effects on animals= The LD50 of cicutoxin for mice is 2.8 mg kg‚àí1 (10.8 Œºmol kg‚àí1). In comparison, the LD50 of virol A is 28.0 mg kg‚àí1 (109 Œºmol kg‚àí1) and of isocicutoxin is 38.5 mg kg‚àí1 (149 Œºmol kg‚àí1). Cattle usually ingest parts of Cicuta plants in Spring, while grazing on new growth around ditches and rivers where these plants grow. Animals display similar effects of cicutoxin poisoning as do humans, but without vomiting (which can lead to increased lethality) - recorded symptoms include salivation, seizures, frequent urination and defecation, and degeneration of skeletal and cardiac muscles. Seizures are usually short, less than a minute per seizure, and occur at intervals of 15 to 30 minutes for around two hours. Ewes recover more slowly after eating cicutoxin-containing tubers, taking up to seven days to recover fully. Research studies on ewes has shown that skeletal and cardiac myodegeneration (damage of muscle tissues) only occur after a dose sufficient to induce symptoms of intoxication is administered. Analysis of the animal's blood showed elevated serum enzymes that indicate muscle damage (LDH, AST and CK values). At necropsy, the ewe's heart had multifocal pale areas and pallor of the long digital extensor muscle groups; by contrast, a ewe given a lethal dose of cicutoxin-containing tubers had only microscopic lesions. The number and duration of seizures had a direct effect on the skeletal and cardiac myodegeneration and amount of serum change. Ewes given up to 2.5 times the lethal dose along with medications to treat symptoms of cicutoxin poisoning recovered, demonstrating that symptomatic treatment can be life-saving. Medications administered included sodium pentobarbital (at 20‚Äì77 mg kg‚àí1 intravenously) at the first seizure to control seizure activity, atropine (75‚Äì150 mg) to reduce salivary excretion during anesthesia, and Ringer's lactate solution until the ewes recovered. Medical use Cicutoxin has been shown to have anti-leukemia properties as it inhibits the proliferation of the lymphocytes. It has also been investigated for antitumor activity, where it was shown that a methanolic extract of C. maculata demonstrated significant cytotoxicity in the 9 KB (human nasopharyngeal carcinoma) cell structure assay. Cicutoxin is also used as a natural drug against breast cancer, because of its antitumor activity.

It is located approximately north of the City of Edmonton along Highway 2.  History  The St Jean Baptiste Church in downtown Morinville Morinville was settled by Father Morin, a missionary of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, who brought many French settlers in the late 1800s, followed by several German pioneers‚Äîhence its many French and German families such as Hittinger, Riopel, Boissonnault, Tailleur, Houle, Labont√©, St. Laurent, Maisonneuve, Bokenfohr, Krauskopf, Rustemier, and Meyers. The monument located in the St. Jean Baptiste Park lists the many names of pioneers and settlers to Morinville. Once situated on the street at 100 Avenue and 100 Street, the monument was moved to its present location in 2000, as it was a safety hazard and very difficult to enjoy with all the traffic at the intersection. The first post-office opened in 1894. The Roman Catholic Church of the St. Jean Baptiste Parish was built in 1907. The church, along with its adjacent but now inoperative convent Morinville Convent, was declared a historical site in 1975. In 2005, the grounds of the church were landscaped with a clock tower, new grass, trees and shrubs, in celebration of Alberta's 100th anniversary as a province. Morinville has a long history of successful business ventures as one of the first locations in Western Canada to open a Royal Bank of Canada in 1910 and a credit union in 1940. A series of successful international business ventures include Champion Pet Foods that exports around the world.  Demographics  The population of the Town of Morinville according to its 2020 municipal census is 10,578, a change from its 2016 municipal census population of 9,893. In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Town of Morinville recorded a population of 9,848 living in 3,491 of its 3,611 total private dwellings, a change from its 2011 population of 8,569. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. In the 2011 Census, the Town of Morinville had a population of 8,569 living in 3,078 of its 3,261 total dwellings, a 26.5% change from its 2006 population of 6,775. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011.  Economy  As of 2010, 93% of Morinville's tax base is residential in nature. One of the town's larger businesses, Champion Pet Foods, employs approximately 50 people.  Attractions  Recreation amenities in Morinville include walking trails, a splash park, a trout pond, a skateboard park, a hockey arena, a curling rink, numerous parks and playgrounds, and outdoor fitness equipment stations along the trail system and at the splash park among other amenities. Other recreation amenities are available in St. Albert and Edmonton to the south. The Morinville Lesisure Centre (MLC) opened in May 2019. The facility contains an arena, a multi-use court space and a small gym. Future expansion of this facility is in consideration.  Education  The Sturgeon Public School Division operates 2 schools in Morinville - √âcole Morinville Public (ECE to Grade 4) and Four Winds Public School (Grade 5‚Äì9). Greater St. Albert Catholic Regional Division offers faith-based education in three schools ‚Äì √âcole Notre Dame Elementary, Georges H. Primeau Middle School and Morinville Community High School. Prior to 2011, Morinville had only Catholic schools, and no secular or Protestant schools. This led to non-Catholic parents starting an advocacy campaign to introduce a secular option for education in Morinville. In response, Sturgeon School Division and the Town of Morinville agreed to provide space for a secular education program for grades 1‚Äì4 for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year. Further, the Government of Alberta committed to conducting a census in Morinville, Legal, St. Albert and a portion of Sturgeon County to determine the minority faith in the area as a precursor to developing a long- term solution to address secular education in Morinville.  Media  Morinville is served by four local weekly newspapers ‚Äî The Free Press, Farm 'n' Friends, the St. Albert Gazette, and The Morinville News.

His first appearance was in The King of Fighters 2003 as leader of its Hero Team. Ash, a teenager, participates in the series' fighting tournaments. He employs a personal fighting style that involves pyrokinesis with green flames. Despite being the series' protagonist since its third story arc, Ash's behavior is generally antagonistic and he tries to steal powers from several recurring characters, leaving them powerless. His identity and intentions are further explored in the 2011 title, The King of Fighters XIII, and he has been featured in print adaptations and a drama CD based on the games. SNK Playmore staff created Ash as an evil main character, in contrast to previous main characters. His moves have been reworked in every game in which he has appeared, gaining new techniques as a result of his actions or modified to balance the character roster. Critical response to Ash has been largely negative due to his androgynous appearance and his technique. In interviews and press releases, video game publisher UTV Ignition Entertainment noted that he was unpopular with Western gamers and his design was better suited to Japanese fans.  Appearances  Introduced in The King of Fighters 2003, Ash leads the New Hero Team of Duo Lon and Shen Woo which participates in a new King of Fighters tournament. After the tournament, he ambushes host Chizuru Kagura and steals her powers, telling Iori Yagami he will be his next opponent. In The King of Fighters XI, the character teams up with Oswald and Shen Woo. At the game's end Ash leaves his teammates to fight each other, after disclosing that Oswald's price for joining him was finding a drug he can only obtain after defeating their pharmacist's enemy, their own teammate Shen. He later finds a berserker, Iori, defeats him and steals his powers. When Ash's comrade Elisabeth Blanctorche accuses him of abandoning his original mission and becoming obsessed with power, he leaves after saying that Kyo Kusanagi will be his next victim. Ash also appears as an available fighter in the KOF: Maximum Impact 2's update KOF Maximum Impact Regulation A and The King of Fighters XII, games without a storyline. In The King of Fighters XIII Ash is the only character not part of a team, and it is learned that he works for Those From the Past (seen in 2003 and XI). However, he has a conflict with organization leader Saiki at the end of the game. Ash is the final boss in The King of Fighters XIII as (also known as Evil Ash) with power stolen from Saiki, who is trying to possess him. He ultimately sacrifices himself to destroy Saiki. While Ash's memories start disappearing from almost every people who knew him, he still makes cameos in some endings. It is revealed in The King of Fighters XIV that Ash is trapped in a time vortex, with an entity known as Verse enveloping him. It is later also revealed that Verse, along with an unnamed blue creature, whose half of their power fragments somehow implanted into young Shun'ei, was created from Ash's result on changing his timeline back in the previous tournament, creating timeline interferences and resulting in Samurai Shodown's Nakoruru traveling to the present and stuck there, along with a time-displaced Mui Mui of Dragon Gal and Love Heart of Sky Love. The new tournament participant, Kukri of the Official Invitation Team, is hired by Elisabeth to find Ash's whereabouts. With Verse's defeat as his reality manipulation energy spreads around worldwide, Kukri and Elisabeth finally found Ash alive. Ash has made appearances in various other King of Fighters media as well. In the fourth chapter of the anime The King of Fighters: Another Day, he sets fire to a city to lure Kyo into a trap. He is also prominent in the manhua adaptations of The King of Fighters 2003 by Wing Yang and King Tung. In the 2003 tournament, Ash's team is defeated in the final but later helps defeat the demon Mukai. Although he is not part of the recurring tournament in The King of Fighters XII manhua, he briefly confronts Kyo in an attempt to steal his powers. Ash also appears in the CD drama KOF: Mid Summer Struggle, which has a mock King of Fighters tournament. Outside The King of Fighters, the character appears in a dating sim part of the Days of Memories series. Creation and development Ash was designed as an \\"attractive evil character\\", in contrast to previous King of Fighters heroes. The supervising designer created the character as desired, with few changes since conception. When The King of Fighters 2003 was released and Ash introduced, the staff did not want to disclose information about him, instead telling fans to look forward to his \\"exploits.\\" His canonical height is 178 cm (5'10\\") and he weighs 59 kg (130 lbs). According to a staff member, Falcoon, the goal was to make Ash an ambiguous protagonist who made players \\"feel bad\\" for cheering for him. Although Falcoon did not design the character, he added details while illustrating him. Due to Ash's late appearance in The King of Fighters 2003, the staff joked that teammate Shen Woo seemed more like the series' main character than Ash did. For The King of Fighters XIII, producer Kei Yamamoto wanted gamers who had played previous titles with Ash to consider the character's motivation and whether they could relate to him. One of three reasons for the title of KOF: Maximum Impact 2 Regulation \\"A\\" was Ash's introduction to the spin-off series. Falcoon called the character \\"really wild\\" because of his role in the series and his personality. Nona (another artist in charge) said that of the original King of Fighters characters, he liked Ash and looked forward to his development. In The King of Fighters XII Ash was the character the staff worked on the most, reworking his movements and speech to be more consistent with the rest of the cast. The King of Fighters XIII producer Kei Yamamoto jokingly called him a character players could use to \\"show off\\". His EX version in the game makes more multiple hits than his regular form, and the \\"disgusting\\" style of his move is said to fit his character. Since his introduction, Ash has acquired new moves in accordance with his action in the series. After The King of Fighters 2003 Ash gained Chizuru Kagura's , a move allowing him to steal his opponents' special moves. After defeating Iori Yagami, the character acquired the Neo Max move (his strongest attack in The King of Fighters XIII). During the game's development, the staff considered returning Fructidor's animation style to an earlier version they had tested. Artist Ogura stated that designing Ash's final form was conceived shortly after he saw early designs of Saiki. Following this, Ogura tried drawing Ash's possessed form from The King of Fighters XIII where he was careful in showing that while the enemy's body is Ash's, the one fighting is Saiki as represented by his black flames. Despite early pressure about that, once seeing Saiki's similarities with Ash, Ogura managed to draw the Evil Ash easily. The idea behind this character was giving an vibe of a repulsive person. Reception Ash Crimson's character had a mixed reception in video-game publications. When he was introduced, GameSpy's Christian Nutt called him a \\"clone\\" of Guile from the Street Fighter series because of their similar movesets but Ash's team was praised as new characters with new elements in the series. Lucas M. Thomas of IGN wrote that a major fan complaint was the character's strength in the games, which made him one of the strongest opponents despite an apparent lack of effort. According to Thomas, Ash is \\"nothing if not strange\\" and the writer lamented his many appearances in the KOF 2003 manhua compared with more-popular characters. When playable characters for the arcade version of The King of Fighters XIII were introduced, Anime News Network's Todd Ciolek speculated about Ash's lack of teammates and wondered if he was alone because \\"no one likes Ash now.\\" Marissa Meli of UGO Networks ranked Ash sixteenth on a list of \\"The Most Androgynous Video Game Characters\\", with Meli jokingly attributing his androgynous appearance to a desire by Japanese designers to confuse Western gamers about their sexuality. Although he called Ash's voice one of \\"Gaming's Top 10 Deepest Voices\\", Dan Howdle of Now Gamer referred to him as a female character and writers for Game Informer joked about their surprise at the discovery that Ash is a male character. After UTV Ignition Entertainment polled fans to choose an artbox for console versions of The King of Fighters XII, the company announced that Ash's unpopularity reduced the number of potential covers to two (featuring Kyo and Iori). Den of Geek listed Ash as the 23rd best The King of Fighters with the writer comparing him with Loki based on their antagonistic and tricky behaviour as well as how his heroic traits in KOF XIII gave fans different thoughts. Complex listed him as one of gaming's \\"douchiest\\" characters androgynous look as well as how he steals the powers of Chizuru Kagura and Iori Yagami. GamesRadar found the character's name as one of the worst one ever seen in gaming. In an interview with Ignition Entertainment director of business development Shane Bettehausen, Alex Lucard of Diehard GameFan said that North American SNK fans detested Ash and complained about his inclusion in The King of Fighters XII without a storyline while popular series characters were overlooked. Bettehausen defended the character, calling him \\"nuanced and improved\\" and his moves \\"incredibly effective\\". In June 2009, Stephen Totilo of Kotaku interviewed Bettehausen, who asked him while Totilo was playing to guess Ash's gender. When Totilo said the character was female, Betehausen called KOF \\"progressive\\" in introducing a cross-dressing character and said that fans were apparently \\"warming up to him\\". On Destructoid, Jonathan Holmes praised Ash's character as \\"defying traditional gender roles while kicking some ass\\" and called him \\"the perfect mascot for the KoF series as a whole.\\" Kevin S.from GameRevolution wondered about his removal in The King of Fighters XIV seeing Ash as a \\"fan favorite\\" character. Merchandising related to Ash's appearance has also been released.

Overview A relatively exclusive group with a history and traditions similar to many fraternal organizations, the Idlers are the only all-male a cappella vocal group at the U. S. Coast Guard Academy. Membership is attained through annual auditions overseen by the current members and the director. Group size varies based on current requirements, but generally includes between 12 and 20 men. The ideal group includes 3 or 4 members for each part: Tenor 1, Tenor 2, Baritone, and Bass. The group began in 1957 with 14 singers, two of which were freshman (4/c cadets). The Idlers have an elected president, who historically was the \\"pitch\\" and leads rehearsals in the absence of the director. The vice president was the \\"vice- pitch\\", also an elected position. History The Original Idlers, circa 1958 =Founding= The Idlers were formed in 1957 by eight members of the USCGA Class of 1959 on summer cruise. They quickly drew the attention of the Academy's bandmaster Don Janse and began building their repertoire and fame. In the fall of 1957, the Idlers membership was extended to all Academy classes, as reflected in this photo, taken several months thereafter. Within two years the Idlers had recorded three vinyl albums (for both the DesignDesign Discography Listing, retrieved 2010-12-12 and MGM labels), and had performed for President and Mrs. Eisenhower at the White House and on The Bell Telephone Hour (NBC).Reflections on The Founding of The Idlers , retrieved 2011-02-12 =1960s= Don Janse went back to school in the early 1960s and John Heffermann briefly directed the Idlers.

According to the epic Taiheiki, Tsunenaga was secretly made heir-apparent before he left, but no other documents confirm this.

The airport covers 426 acres (1.7 km¬≤) and has two runways. The FAA calls it a reliever airport for nearby Louisville International Airport. History Established in 1919, Bowman Field is Kentucky's first commercial airport and is the oldest continually operating commercial airfield in North America. It was founded by Abram H. Bowman, who was drawn to aviation by the interest generated during World War I. Bowman found an outlet for his enthusiasm after meeting and forming a brief partnership with Louisvillian Robert H. Gast, a pilot and World War I veteran of the Royal Flying Corps. Bowman leased a parcel of land east of Louisville from the U.S. Government in 1919 to operate the airfield, which opened in 1921. The first business ventures began with the aerial photography business in 1921, and the 465th Pursuit Squadron (Reserve) began operations at Bowman Field in 1922. Charles Lindbergh landed the Spirit of St. Louis at the airport in 1927, viewed by 10,000 spectators. During the Great Depression, Louisvillians would often come to the Art Deco terminal building to watch airplanes depart and land as a form of inexpensive entertainment. During the 1930s Eastern Air Lines and Trans World Airlines (TWA) carried passengers and mail in and out of Bowman Field; in 1947 the airlines moved to Standiford Field. During World War II Bowman Field was one of the nation's most important training bases and the nation's busiest airport. The facility became known as \\"Air Base City\\" when a bomber squadron moved in and more than 1,600 recruits underwent basic training in a three-month period. The United States Army Air Forces' school for flight surgeons, medical technicians, and flight nurses also called Bowman Field home. Bowman Field was used in the James Bond film Goldfinger as the base for Pussy Galore's Flying Circus; principal photography of hangars, aircraft, etc., were done there in fall of 1963. Historic buildings Bowman Field, Louisville, c. 1940 Postcard showing Bowman Field, Kentucky. Administration Building and Hangar c.1939 In 1988, three adjacent buildings at the airport were added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Bowman Field Historic District. They are the airport Administration Building (1929; 1936‚Äì37), the Curtiss Flying Service Hangar (1929), and the Army Air Corps Hangar (1931‚Äì32). Since many urban airports are located in industrial areas, this verdant setting is unusual and contributes to the ambience of the Bowman Field Historic District. The buildings of the Bowman Field Historic District are related not only by proximity and historical function, but by their Art Deco/Art Moderne styling and use of masonry materials such as brick, stone and concrete. The dominant landmark of Bowman Field is its terminal, known as the Administration Building, styled in aerodynamic Streamline Moderne, and designed by the firm of Wischmeyer and Arrasmith. As built in 1929, it was a fairly modest two-story structure with one-story wings, housing administrative and communications offices, weather station, and restaurant. During 1936 and 1937, it nearly tripled in size. This was accomplished by demolishing the east wing and retaining the west and central sections as west wings of the new building. The Administration Building faces an elliptical landscaped island surrounded by a driveway and paved parking area. The 1920s Art-Deco style Le Relais French restaurant has made its home in the airport's historic terminal for more than 25 years. Current operations Bowman Field Today Bowman Field is home to hundreds of privately owned aircraft as well as several commercial operations, including Central American Airways, which opened its doors in 1946, Falcon Aviation (which can trace its roots to the old Louisville Flying Service that began operations in 1932), Aero Club of Louisville, Inc., and Louisville Executive Aviation. Several flight schools operate there as well. In the year ending September 23, 2013, the airport averaged 203 aircraft operations per day: 47% local general aviation, 47% transient general aviation 5% air taxi and <1% military. 193 aircraft are based at this airport: 159 single-engine, 33 multi- engine, 3 jet, and 3 helicopter. Kentucky Flying Service is no longer in operation. It was started by Captain Richard C. Mulloy who flew C-46s and C-47s with the Flying Tigers over \\"The Hump\\" in World War II. He was known by employees and students of Kentucky Flying Service as \\"Dick Mulloy,\\" and died surrounded by his family in Louisville on Saturday, May 8, 2010, at the age of 89. Bowman Field is operated by the Louisville Regional Airport Authority, which also operates Louisville International Airport.

He played second base, third base, and then coached at several professional levels. His Los Angeles Angels No. 50 was retired, and he was inducted into the Angels Hall of Fame. Early life Reese was born James Herman Solomon and was Jewish, born in New York City, and was brought up in Los Angeles where he attended Rolling Hills Prep. In order to avoid the brunt of prejudice against Jewish baseball players, he adopted the name of Jimmie Reese, which he used throughout his baseball career. Playing career Much of his career was spent in the Pacific Coast League, beginning as a batboy with the Los Angeles Angels from 1919 (at least one source claims 1917) to 1923. =Oakland Oaks= In 1924 he signed a contract to play second base with the Oakland Oaks. The Oaks won the PCL pennant in 1927, with Reese batting .295 in 191 games. He had a league- leading fielding percentage of .984 that year. =New York Yankees= In September 1927 he was traded by Oakland to the New York Yankees with Lyn Lary and US$100,000 (US$ today). He was called up to the American League in 1930. Reese played for the Yankees in 1930 and 1931, and was most noted for being the roommate of Babe Ruth. In 1930 he batted .346 in 188 at bats, striking out only 8 times. Only Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth hit for higher averages on the team. He was the primary back-up at second base (48 games) behind Tony Lazzeri (77 games). =St. Paul Saints= In November, 1931, he was sent by the Yankees to the St. Paul Saints (American Association), to complete an earlier deal made in June, 1931, for Johnny Murphy, Jack Saltzgaver, cash, and 2 players to be named. =St. Louis Cardinals= Reese played the 1932 season with the St. Louis Cardinals, who had selected him off of waivers in June. =Los Angeles Angels (PCL)= The Los Angeles Angels (PCL) purchased Reese's contract from the Cardinals in February, 1933. He missed most of the season due to injuries and illness, but hit .330 in 104 games. The following year he batted .311 with 12 triples, and had a fielding percentage of .972 (the best among second basemen that season). He continued to play for the Angels in 1935 and 1936. =San Diego Padres (PCL)= In 1937, he was traded to the San Diego Padres (PCL), where he hit .314. The Padres won the Governor's Cup that year. =Semi-retirement as player= He all-but retired as a player after the 1938 season, spending the 1939 season with two Western International League teams and playing just 2 games for the 1940 Angels (in addition to his coaching duties). After his playing career Reese served in the Army from November 1942 to July 1943 with the 12th Armored Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, where he managed the baseball team. After the war, he worked as a scout for the Boston Braves for two years, and coached in San Diego from 1948 until 1960, when he was appointed manager. But he preferred to coach, so he resigned partway through the 1961 season. \\"I'm best suited as a liaison man, as a coach\\", he said. \\"I just am not suited to give a guy hell.\\" From 1963 until 1970 he coached at Hawaii, Seattle, and Portland, Oregon; then, he scouted for the Montreal Expos. He threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the 1989 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, played at Anaheim Stadium. Reese never married, had no children, and was mostly estranged from his extended family. In 1972, at age 71, he asked the Angels for a job, and was hired as conditioning coach, whose job was to get the players into shape. Reese's main specialty, however, was hitting fungos in practice, using a fungo bat he made himself. Numerous Angels players remarked on his seemingly uncanny ability to place fungos where he wanted. He even occasionally \\"pitched\\" batting practice with his fungo bat, standing at the pitcher's rubber and consistently hitting line drives over the middle of the plate. He was regularly called \\"the nicest man in baseball,‚Äù and had a friendship with Nolan Ryan when he was with the team; Ryan would name one of his sons Reese in his honor. He was listed as an Angels coach for 22 years, until his death on July 13, 1994, in Santa Ana, California. He died peacefully of aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure. His uniform #50 was retired by the club in his memory. At his death, Reese was believed to be the oldest person ever to regularly wear a uniform in an official capacity in the history of organized professional baseball in North America. His record was surpassed in 2016 by Red Schoendienst, who served as a special assistant coach for the St. Louis Cardinals, wearing a Cardinals uniform in that role, until his death in 2018 at age 95. Ted Radcliffe and Buck O'Neil made appearances in professional games at older ages, but those were one-off ceremonial events. He was inducted into the Pacific Coast League Hall of Fame in 2003.Pacific Coast League Hall of Fame at BR Bullpen, accessed 2013-06-24 See also *List of select Jewish baseball players In popular culture In the Lee Child novel One Shot (2005), the hero Jack Reacher uses the alias Jimmie Reese. He confirms that whenever he uses an alias, he always uses the name of someone who played second base for the Yankees, such as Jimmie Reese.

The bomb-damaged industrial landscape of his home town became the backdrop of much of his fashion photography, and he set the trend for positioning fashion models in stark and gritty urban environments. Flats and gasometers were popular settings, and he often had the models adopt adventurous poses. He wedged one model up the side of a building, and photographed another as she posed dangling from a parachute. Along with David Bailey and Brian Duffy (nicknamed by Norman Parkinson the 'Black Trinity'),\\"Arena, aka Norman Parkinson\\", BBC TV. he captured, and in many ways helped create, the Swinging London of the 1960s: a culture of high fashion and celebrity chic.

Although \\"Thorough\\" is largely attributed to Strafford, its implementation can also be accredited to the Archbishop of Canterbury William Laud.  Under Laud Laud exploited his secular and religious roles to implement the policy of Thorough in England. Laud used his authority as Archbishop of Canterbury to appoint only Arminian clergymen as bishops; this in turn meant that most vicars they appointed would also be Arminian. Arminianism is a sect of Protestant Christianity which believes in the \\"Divine Right of Kings\\" and the (Catholic reminiscent) \\"Beauty of Holiness\\". Laud hoped that his new Arminian Church of England would make the English conform to believing in the \\"Divine Right\\", supporting Charles I's personal rule and setting up a parliament-independent monarchy. Though English Arminians often supported expansion of royal authority, this did not correlate to support of absolutist monarchies. Arminians challenged Calvinist conception of absolute predestination by introducing an element of free will into Protestant soteriology; that is, they asserted that even the elect (those destined to salvation) could fall totally and finally from saving grace. This idea often translated into acceptance of an increased role of sacraments and the ecclesiastical hierarchy, or the \\"Beauty of Holiness\\", though this was not necessarily the case.Anti-Calvinism: The Rise of English Arminianism. The phrase \\"Divine Right of Kings\\" has been incorrectly interpreted as equivalent to absolutism.Robert Bucholz & Newton Key, Early Modern England, 1485-1714: A Narrative History, 2d edition and David Cressy & Lori Anne Ferrell, Religion and Society in Early Modern England, 2d. Laud used his authority over the prerogative courts to humiliate the gentry, who were largely Puritan and Presbyterian. As Puritans and Presbyterians, the gentry were opposed to Laud's beliefs and opposed to the idea of a parliament-independent monarchy. William Laud used his authority over the prerogative courts to punish many people, including Puritan martyr William Prynne. In this era, religious issues were constitutional issues as in the case of Charles I and William Laud's attempt to impose the English Book of Common Prayer on Scotland.The English Revolution, Economic Problems of the Church: From Archbishop Whitgift to the Long Parliament, Puritanism and Revolution: Studies in Interpretation of the English Revolution of the 17th Century, Society and Puritanism in Pre- Revolutionary England  Under Strafford  Strafford was Lord Deputy of Ireland, and domiciled in Ireland for much of the personal rule. He left the running of England largely to Laud, although the application of Thorough in Ireland was entirely down to Strafford. The fear that Strafford instilled in the Irish through the policy of \\"Thorough\\" can be demonstrated when looking at the ease with which Strafford extracted subsidies from the Irish Parliament as the Second Bishops War approached during 1640.

A versatile forward who could shoot with either his left or right hand, Love now works as the Bulls' Director of Community Affairs. Early years After starring at Morehouse High School (now defunct) in Louisiana, Love played basketball for Southern University, where he also became a brother of Alpha Phi Omega. He earned All- America honors in 1963, and in 1965, the Cincinnati Royals selected the 6‚Äô8\\" forward in the fourth round of the 1965 NBA draft. Love failed to make the team, and instead spent the 1965‚Äì66 NBA season in the Eastern Basketball League. After averaging over 25 points per game, Love earned the EBL Rookie of the Year Award and gained enough confidence to try out for the Royals once more. He made the team on his second attempt and played two seasons for the Royals, largely in a reserve role. Love made his NBA debut on October 18, 1966.https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/lovebo01.html In 1968, the Milwaukee Bucks selected him in the NBA Expansion Draft and traded him to the Chicago Bulls in the middle of the 1968‚Äì69 season. Chicago Bulls (1968‚Äì1976) Love flourished while playing for Dick Motta's Bulls. In 1969‚Äì70, he became a full-time starter, averaging 21 points and 8.7 rebounds. The following two seasons he averaged 25.2 and 25.8 points per game, appeared in his first two NBA All-Star Games, and earned All-NBA Second Team honors both seasons. Love also appeared in the 1973 All-Star Game, and he would average at least 19 points and six rebounds every season until 1976‚Äì77. Love was named to the NBA's All-Defense Second Team in 1974 and 1975. His #10 jersey was the second jersey number to be retired by the Chicago Bulls. Jerry Sloan's #4 was the first. Love's 1995 wedding ceremony to Rachel Dixon took place at the United Center. Post-basketball career Love in 2010 Love ended his NBA career with the Bulls after spending parts of the 1976‚Äì77 season in New York and Seattle. He would finish with career totals of 13,895 points, 1,123 assists, and 4,653 rebounds. Love developed a stutter in childhood, and some say it prevented him from finding meaningful employment after his playing days were over. At one point, Love was a busboy making $4.45 an hour. Eventually, the owner of the restaurant where Love washed dishes offered to pay for speech therapy classes, and in 1993 he returned to the Chicago Bulls as their director of community relations. One of his duties in this position involves regularly speaking to school children. Love has also become a motivational speaker. He wrote a book, The Bob Love Story: If It's Gonna Be, It's Up to Me (), in 1999.

The river Mentue flows through the commune. The first stone bridge over this river was built during the Bernese period in 1754. Later becoming too narrow, it was widened in 1892 to form the present bridge on the Yverdon/Moudon road.

Charles III, Duke of Savoy sold it in 1534 to Marguerite de Bellevaux, who sold it on to Guillaume Regnauld who in turn sold it to Marguerite de Chan√©az in 1597.

Butler was highly regarded for his technical skills and performed chief mechanic duties on several of his winning race cars. He also communicated his view of racing to fans both as author and television commentator. Despite a relatively brief racing career (1981‚Äì1993), Butler is an inductee into the National Sprint Car Hall of Fame, the USAC Hall of Fame, and the Hoosier Auto Racing Fan's Hall of Fame. He retired at age 37 to pursue both an engineering career and more time with his growing family. Butler currently resides in Kokomo, IN. United States Auto Club records In 1990, Butler became the first four-time Sprint Car National Champion in the 34-year history of the United States Automobile Club. USACUSAC Sprint Car Champions Butler won USAC sprint car races on pavement, dirt, and on dirt with wings. He is the only driver to win in all of these categories during a single USAC season. In addition to his Sprint Car championships, Butler won two championships in USAC's Silver Crown division.USAC Silver Crown Champions Winning six national championships places Butler in the top-tier of all-time USAC driving champions.USAC Champions-All Divisions This distinction includes all championships in any of USAC's national championship racing divisions including Indy Car, Silver Crown Car, Sprint Car, Midget, and Stock Car. In this category A. J. Foyt is first with 9 titles; Levi Jones, Mel Kenyon and the late Rich Vogler share second (7 titles each). Butler earned his six championships in just 10 seasons of USAC competition, the highest percentage of championships won vs. seasons raced of this group. Early life Steve was born to parents Bruce and Sharon Butler and has three sisters Linda, Laura, and Melanie. Due to Bruce's career as an USAF pilot, the family lived in England for four years shortly after Steve's birth. Bruce loved all things mechanical‚Äîespecially those that involve speed. He repaired and modified cars in his free time and also owned a go-kart that he drove on remote parts of the British aircraft parking ramps, often allowing young Steve to ride in his lap. Shortly after the family returned from England, Bruce was killed in an airplane crash. At the time, Steve was six years old but had already caught his father's enthusiasm for cars and airplanes. Steve set out to learn as much as possible about these mechanical wonders without benefit of his father's tutelage. By age 14, he had disassembled and rebuilt the family car and became known as the neighborhood ‚Äúmotor-head.\\" By age 20, Steve was a full-time student in the Flight Technology school at Vincennes University. Planning to become a pilot, he had earned his commercial pilot license and had distinguished himself by winning the school's ‚ÄúTop Aerobatic Pilot‚Äù award. However, he left school early to launch his professional motorcycle racing career. He was anxious to get serious about racing and was concerned that he was already 4 years older than most of his professional motorcycle racing peers. AMA Pro Racing Min. Age Requirements. Racing career=Motorcycle racing= Butler launched his amateur bike racing career upon graduating from high school. His first opportunity came when a buddy agreed to let him race an old bike under a lease/purchase agreement. This involved Steve paying $25/week for the machine with earnings from flipping hamburgers after school. Realizing that his meager budget was insufficient to race competitively, Butler prevailed upon a friend to provide (free) transport to/from the races. This allowed Steve to buy tires and other racing essentials. The strategy worked and allowed Butler to begin winning races. In 1976, Butler was able to win the AMA District 15 (Indiana) ¬Ω Mile Flat Track Championship which convinced him to advance to professional motorcycle racing. However, in his first pro season Butler was severely injured during a race at the Onekama, MI ¬Ω mile dirt track. He remained in the hospital for 30 days and spent nine months recovering from his injuries. This was the fourth time in four years that he found himself recovering from fractured bones resulting from motorcycle racing. Butler rides to a win in a 1978 pro flat track race at the Greenville (OH) ¬Ω mile In 1978, Butler rebounded from his injuries by winning a pro race at Beaver Dam, WI‚Äîhis very first event after recovering from the Onekama crash. More than 20 years later, Butler's exploits are recalled in a 2001 Cycle News article featuring racers successful in both motorcycle and automobile racing. This piece placed Butler on a short-list of motorcycle/car racers that included legends such as Joe Leonard, Swede Savage, and Steve Morehead. Butler began 1979 aboard a Harley-Davidson XR-750‚Äîfamous for both its performance and high maintenance costs. Unfortunately, these costs became prohibitive and Butler had to stop racing mid-season due to insufficient finances. At this point, he began attending local sprint car races and became inspired to abandon the unreliable Harley for a new kind of racer. =Early sprint cars= If Butler's motorcycle racing was conducted on a ‚Äúshoe-string‚Äù budget, his entry into Sprint Car racing was seemingly hopeless‚Äîhe was attempting to enter an advanced class of auto racing with no money and no prior auto racing experience. He was also nearly 25 years old and the sport was tilting towards very young drivers; in just a few years Jeff Gordon would begin his own sprint car career at age 13. Undaunted, Butler jumped in with both feet by selling all of his race bikes and his transport van (his only personal transportation). When liquidating his assets was insufficient to buy a sprint car, he convinced his future wife, Thomasa Brock, to help him obtain a loan using her own home as collateral. This provided enough money to buy a beat-up old Sprint Car. Butler spent the winter of 1980‚Äì81 rebuilding the crashed and worn-out car in his mom's garage, using only hand tools and a gas- welding rig. The lack of sophisticated tools made this work very labor- intensive. Butler relied on a dedicated group of friends who volunteered to provide the labor and skills necessary to get the fabrication work done. Steve planned the overall design, performed the engine building, and participated in the fabrication work. As the 1981 season opened, Butler was pouring all available money into the race car and was still without street wheels of any sort. Once again, a friend came to the rescue by offering to tow the race car. Despite these financial problems, Butler was able to win his very first (heat) race. This quick success led to Butler's first big break when Ezra Beachy, a local engine shop owner, offered Butler an engine sponsorship Although the Beachy engine sponsorship was very exciting, Butler's immediate problem was that he was rapidly running out of the money needed for essentials such as race tires and fuel. After only three weeks of racing, it was now uncertain if the team could even make the next race, let alone a full season. The atmosphere was gloomy, within Mom Butler's garage/race shop, when a newspaper delivery kid mentioned that one of his customers was a race fan. Butler immediately followed-up on this tip by arranging to meet with Bud Whitacre, a local supermarket owner. This led to $500 for a new set of tires and the beginning of a lifelong relationship. In January 1983, Butler began the year by marrying Thomasa. Unfortunately, the couple could not yet afford a honey- moon. This problem was solved, later that year, when Butler won the 1983 Paragon Speedway track championship. Instead of a trophy, track promoter Mike Johnson supplied the couple with a trip to the Bahamas which became their belated honey-moon trip. =United States Auto Club Racing=Debut In 1982, Butler's first USAC appearance was dramatic. On his first qualifying lap, still driving his original home-built race car, Butler set a new track record at Bloomington, IN; on the second lap he flipped out of the track. Steve did return to race six USAC races in 1983, posting top-three finishes in half of these. However, his primary focus was on winning the 1983 Paragon track championship. =1984= During his rookie USAC season, Butler delivers an upset win over Steve Kinser and Ken Schrader at Terra Haute, INButler mounted his first effort to campaign the full USAC Sprint Car series in 1984. He quickly seized national attention by winning his first USAC race on live television. The Jud Larson/Don Branson memorial, held on the high- banked ¬Ω mile at Eldora Speedway, was broadcast on ABC's Wide World of Sports. The win was unexpected, as Butler started 10th behind formidable veterans such as Jack Hewitt, Sheldon Kinser, and Rickey Hood. However, Butler quickly moved through the field to take the lead from Hewitt on the 16th lap to claim his first USAC victory. In June, Steve and Thomasa became parents with the birth of Jennifer. Just two days later, Butler won the annual Kokomo Classic race with both his wife and newborn daughter in attendance. By the end of the year, Butler had won 5 USAC sprint races, one less than eventual series champion Rickey Hood. The most impressive of these was at the flat Terre Haute Action Track ¬Ω mile; Butler started 7th and then drove past visiting champions Ken Schrader (defending USAC champ) and Steve Kinser (defending World of Outlaws champ) to earn the win. Butler went on to finish the season 3rd in USAC points. =1985= In February, Butler started the 1985 season driving in Phoenix (AZ) in a locally owned car. In April, as the Midwest Spring began, he was back in the Whitacre/Beachy sprint car. However, by the end of the year, he had driven for at least 9 different race teams and had advanced to 2nd in the USAC sprint championship standings. In August, Butler hooked-up with Phil Poor, who had just purchased his first sprint car by way of a bargain-priced package. This deal included the car, engine, spares, transport trailer, and even a rusted out Chevy Suburban tow vehicle. Butler and Poor began to win races with the old sprint car even though it had been cast aside‚Äîas uncompetitive‚Äîby its previous owner. In response, Poor named the under- appreciated car ‚ÄúOl‚Äô Whitey.‚Äù This little team was the genesis for many years of racing success, as Butler and Poor went on to win four USAC titles together. Late in the season, Butler joined with the Jarrett racing team to compete in the Springfield Silver Crown race, finishing in the top ten. The new team then finished 2nd in the annual Hoosier Hundred at Indianapolis, nearly winning the race. These performances earned Butler the title of 1985 USAC Silver Crown Rookie of the Year. \\\\---- Championship Years=1986= Butler and Ol' Whitey ride Eldora's cushion to their first USAC championship. In 1986, Ol' Whitey returned as the centerpiece of Phil Poor's small race team. With new sponsorship from Jeff Stoops, Butler drove the faithful car to a very successful racing season. They won USAC races, AllStar Circuit of Champions races and posted some top-five World of Outlaws finishes. The team also won many non-sanctioned ‚Äúspecial‚Äù races including the Indiana Sprint Week championship. In September, Butler capped-off the year by winning the USAC Sprint Championship. Butler continued to improve in the Silver Crown series and advanced to 2nd in the 1986 championship standings. At Indianapolis Raceway Park, Steve impressed the racing fraternity by nearly winning in his very first attempt to race on pavement. Butler started in 16th and then proceeded to drive into the lead, passing NASCAR and Indy 500 competitors such as Ken Schrader, Gary Bettenhausen, and Rich Vogler. Although tire problems dropped him to 2nd at the finish, Butler's race-leading performance had grabbed attention. Butler finished the season with a win at Gas City, IN. This win came the day after Austin, his new son, was born. As with Jennifer's birth, the Butler's celebrated their new child with a race win. =1987= In 1987, the team debuted with brand new equipment as Jeff Stoops supplied the resources to create a truly professional class race team. The team continued its practice of running a variety of races, while concentrating on the USAC Sprint series. A highlight of the year was winning the Tony Hulman classic at Terre Haute Action Track Butler went on to claim his 2nd straight USAC Sprint Championship and was awarded ‚ÄúDriver of the Year‚Äù by the Hoosier Auto Racing Fan club. In the Silver Crown series standings Butler had a strong run and scored top-five finishes in over half the races. He also continued to show potential as a pavement racer, by finishing top-three at both Indianapolis Raceway Park and Phoenix International Raceway. However, in the point standings he was, for the second year in a row, 2nd behind the tough Jack Hewitt. =1988= In 1988, Butler became the first driver to win three consecutive USAC sprint championships. Two of these were during a brief period (1987‚Äì1990) in which USAC added winged dirt races to the traditional mix of pavement and dirt non-winged races. This new challenge provided Steve a chance to demonstrate his versatility by winning all three types of races during the 1988 season. Eldora Speedway, always a Butler favorite, was the site of great dirt wins. In July, Butler won a USAC winged-sprint race at the track. Visiting World of Outlaws stars such as Jac Haudenschild, Jimmy Sills, and Brad Doty made this an especially tough win. These drivers were using the USAC race to prepare for Eldora's King's Royal, the track's premier winged-sprint car race, scheduled the following weekend. A few months later, Butler also won Eldora's most prestigious non-wing sprint race‚Äîthe annual USAC Four-Crown National. Butler on the gas at the 1988 Springfield Mile en route to his first Silver Crown championship.The highlight of Butler's season was his dominance of the new pavement races at Indianapolis Raceway Park where he won on ESPN television and was fastest at the races that he didn‚Äôt win outright (due to mechanical misfortune). In the process, Butler pioneered a new style of passing on the banked oval. His spectacular maneuver was dubbed ‚ÄúThe Butler Grass-Cutter Move‚Äù by ESPN announcers Larry Nuber and Steve Chassey. Twenty years later, this technique was cited as an influence by NASCAR star Jason Leffler after his win in the 2007 Kroger 200 at ORP.\\"NASCAR Racing :Busch Series in Indianapolis.\\" ESPN. Time Warner Cable. 28 July 2007. In the Silver Crown series, Butler finally defeated Jack Hewitt to win the championship. This achievement highlighted Butler's technical capabilities as he was chief mechanic, as well as driver, on the winning Jarrett Farms race car. =1989= In his only Indy Car appearance Butler showed impressive speed until a crash destroyed the car and broke his shoulder. Butler did not defend his USAC titles in 1989 due to his bid to enter Indy Car racing and compete in the Indianapolis 500. Driving a Jeff Stoops-owned Lola/Cosworth, Butler established himself as a top rookie contender by posting the fastest speed (214.246 mph) achieved during the mandatory rookie orientation testing. At the conclusion of the 2nd day of official race practice, Steve was surprised to find himself with speeds among the top veteran drivers. This performance generated considerable excitement, given that Butler had never before raced an Indy Car and was considered a ‚Äúdirt track‚Äù racer. Unfortunately, Butler's fortunes reversed quickly when he crashed heavily, destroyed the car, and suffered a broken right shoulder. In June, after recovering from the broken shoulder, Butler returned to sprint car racing and soon resumed winning races. Unfortunately, in August he was again injured, this time breaking his left shoulder in a sprint car accident. However, Butler missed only one race weekend during his recovery. He made good use of the break by joining Larry Nuber, in the ESPN TV announcer's booth, to call the USAC sprint car action at Indianapolis Raceway Park. =1990= In 1990, Steve returned to USAC racing full-time trying for a record 4th USAC Sprint Car championship. He began the season driving the Aristocrat #2 and won two races, including another ESPN television race at Winchester Speedway. At mid-season he changed rides to the Hoffman #69. The team enjoyed quick success, setting fast qualifying time six-times and setting track records and winning races. This performance secured the USAC Sprint Car championship. The highlight of Butler's Silver Crown season was a dramatic win at Eldora Speedway, where he narrowly defeated Jack Hewitt. The pair battled the entire race, exchanging the lead many times. Their duel set a blistering pace and forced Butler to establish a new 50-lap track record that stood for many years after his retirement =1991= The 1991 season was bittersweet for the Hoffman/Butler alliance. The team continued to excel at raw speed; it set the most fast qualifying times and won the most USAC sprint car races. The team also won the majority of the live-television races on ESPN, including wins on the notorious hi-banks at Salem Speedway and at Indianapolis Raceway Park. Despite being the winningest team on the USAC circuit, they finished third in the series point standings after a string of mechanical problems caused inconsistent finishes. =1992= The highlight of Butler's 1992 USAC season was winning his 2nd Silver Crown championship. This championship run was the most dramatic of Butler's career. Coming into the season's final race, at Eldora Speedway, Butler was well behind point-leader Jeff Swindell. With only a slim chance at the championship, Butler had to win; 2nd place had no mathematical chance. He improved his chances by setting the fastest qualifying speed and earning the pole starting position. During the race, Butler and points-leader Jeff Swindell traded the lead and battled for advantage. In the final laps, Butler was able to prevail for the win, but did not know the championship outcome. Only after points were tallied, did he learn that he had won the championship. Butler attributes much of this success to the return of Phil Poor, his former mechanic on the Stoops sprint car team. Although the pair had not worked together since 1989, winning the Silver Crown championship proved that they still had the right ‚Äúchemistry.‚Äù In the sprint car division, the Butler/Hoffman team struggled through a difficult season marred by crashes and mechanical problems. In between these problems, Butler won at Winchester Speedway after battling with future NASCAR star Tony Stewart. Steve would eventually finish the year second in the championship standings. This was Butler's eighth, and final, season to run the full USAC sprint schedule,Although Butler competed in USAC from 1982 to 1993, he did not run the full USAC sprint schedule during four of these years, due to other obligations: 1982, debut USAC race only; 1983, focus on Paragon Championship; 1989, Indy Car entry and injuries; 1993, USAC Suspension during these years, he won four championships and was never below the top-three in championship points. =Wings= Butler won in both winged-sprint cars and in the non- winged formula preferred by USAC Butler was known primarily for his success in non-winged USAC racing, however he also performed well in the winged-sprint cars. Steve occasionally raced with winged-sprint specialists such as the AllStar Circuit of Champions(Allstars) and World of Outlaws and was very competitive. He won six races with the Allstars and, in 1987, finished top-ten 87 Allstar Point Standings in the AllStar point standings, despite running a limited schedule due to conflicts with his USAC commitments. When USAC briefly experimented with winged-sprint races, Butler won several of these against competition that included regulars from the AllStar Circuit of Champions and World of Outlaws.USAC winged-sprint races typically attracted winged-sprint car specialists that did not compete at non-wing USAC races =Final Season Controversy= For 1993, Butler changed to the Chrisman Racing team hoping to find a new chemistry that could lead to another sprint championship. Butler was consistently running well and, at mid-season, was again leading the point standings in both the Sprint and Silver Crown divisions. Butler scored an early Silver Crown win at the Hulman 100 (Indianapolis). This race was Steve's final USAC victory and included a special twist: Butler was forced to perform in-cockpit diagnosis and repair of a problem that was causing the engine to misfire. At mid-race, the rough-running engine was causing Butler to fade back into the pack and was threatening his ability to even finish. However, during a caution period, Butler was able to identify the problem as a faulty ignition switch. He then disconnected the switch and secured the bare wire by tying it off around a hydraulic hose, thereby preventing the exposed strands from shorting out. All this was accomplished on the race track, while driving with one hand and repairing with the other. With full power restored, Butler charged into the lead and defeated Ron Shuman by 10 seconds at the checkered flag. Unfortunately, Butler's hopes for additional USAC titles were destroyed in July when he was involved in racing accidents in two consecutive races. Officials levied a rare one-month driving suspension against him, effectively eliminated his championship hopes. USAC's actions created significant controversy: the club had little precedent for such harsh action against a current champion and points leader; on the other hand Butler had a history of driving aggressively and some thought his risk-taking style needed to be reigned in. In spite of this controversy‚Äîor perhaps because of it‚Äîthe Hoosier Auto Racing Fan club immediately inducted Butler into its Hall of Fame. At the end of the season, Butler decided to conclude his racing career and focus on pursuing his future career in electronic systems engineering. Engineering career Butler's engineering team watches as US Marines test drive a LAV-25 equipped with Delphi's prototype electronics system. Camp Pendleton, CA. After retiring from racing, Butler focused on a career at Delphi Automotive Systems. In two years, he earned a BSBA from Indiana Wesleyan University and was recognized with the ‚ÄúOutstanding Professional‚Äù award in his graduating class. Despite lacking a technical degree, Butler then set out to become an engineer by relying on technical skills he had honed as a racer. This determination eventually paid off as Butler became a senior systems engineer and received many company awards for his technical contributions. On one occasion, Butler received a $20,000 bonus for cost-saving electrical diagnostic procedures he developed. These accomplishments allowed Butler to receive increasingly challenging technical assignments, such as: * Lead engineer for Delphi's first concept demonstration of ‚Äúfly-by-wire‚Äù electronic throttle control for motorcycle applications. * Lead engineer for a prototype electronic data monitoring system for combat vehicles. Butler was also project manager for the system's installation into a test fleet of United States Marine Corps LAV-25 armored vehicles. * Systems integration technical leader for advanced hybrid electric propulsion for heavy duty vehicles. * Technical manager for Powertrain Electronic Controls. Journalism and media Butler was a regular contributor to _Open Wheel Magazine_ during the last four years of his racing career. He authored a wide range of monthly opinion columns and technical articles until his retirement from racing. In 1992, Butler's writing caught the attention of Motor Trend magazine who asked him to author an engine technology article. Pleased with the result, Motor Trend later offered Steve a full-time technical editor job. Butler declined, wishing to stay in Indiana rather than move to the west coast. Butler also performed as television on- camera commentator for several ESPN broadcasts of USAC races, from 1988 to 1996. His role was to add color and racing insight in order to help fans better understand the sport. He was successful and offered other broadcast opportunities. However, Butler had left racing to pursue an engineering career and time with his family, not to continue to travel to race tracks in a non- driving role. He was also concerned that being at the races would tempt him to get back into the cockpit. Retirement Butler retired from racing determined to make a clean break from the sport to focus on the new challenges of his engineering career, while also devoting more time to his family. Hall of Fame Inductions In 1993, Steve Butler was inducted into the Hoosier Auto Racing Fans Hall of Fame and joined AJ Foyt, Mario Andretti, Bobby Unser, Jeff Gordon and Tony Stewart in receiving this honor. In 2005, Steve Butler was honored to be inducted into National Sprint Car Hall of Fame in Knoxville, IA. Fellow 2005 inductees include Steve Kinser and Robbie Stanley.

Located on the southwestern shore of Lake Neuch√¢tel the village has a population of almost 2,500 which may rise to 7,000 in summer, due to the popularity of the sandy beaches, which gently shelve into the lake. History Aerial view from 500 m by Walter Mittelholzer (1925) Yvonand has a long tradition of settlement. Approximately 4,000 years BC, the caves in the Vallon of Vaux were used as first places of settlement. Some cave paintings date from this time. In the Bronze Age, settlements were made of wooden stakes in Yvonand bay. The area around Yvonand village was settled during the Roman era, on the road between Eburodunum (Yverdon) and Aventicum (Avenches). At Mordagne to the west of the Mentue, the foundation walls of a Roman villa were excavated, which was established around 100 years after Christ. The traces of a settlement, to which a Heiligtum (a Gallo-Roman temple) also belonged, was probably inhabited in the year 400. Yvonand is first mentioned in 1010 as Evonant. The designations Ivonant (1100) appeared later, de Vonant in the 12th Century, Eyvonant (1437) and Yvonant (1453). The place name derives from the Germanic family name Evo and the word 'nant', which signifies a brook or a valley. During the Burgundian Wars in 1476, Yvonand came under the administration of Grandson, which was itself under the common rule of Bern and Fribourg; situated at the southern lakeshore it had its own Court of Justice. In 1531 the commune joined the reformation. After the collapse of the Ancien R√©gime and during the period of Napoleon's Helvetic Republic, from 1798 to 1803, Yvonand was forced to join the Canton of L√©man, which afterwards became Canton Vaud. In 1798, it was assigned to the district of Yverdon. Geography Yvonand has an area, , of . Of this area, or 52.3% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 31.9% is forested. Of the rest of the land, or 12.9% is settled (buildings or roads), or 0.6% is either rivers or lakes and or 2.1% is unproductive land.Swiss Federal Statistical Office-Land Use Statistics 2009 data accessed 25 March 2010 Of the built up area, housing and buildings made up 5.3% and transportation infrastructure made up 5.5%. Out of the forested land, all of the forested land area is covered with heavy forests. Of the agricultural land, 42.0% is used for growing crops and 8.9% is pastures, while 1.4% is used for orchards or vine crops. All the water in the municipality is flowing water.

The village extends along the mouth of the River Mentue, briefly before its delta into Lake Neuch√¢tel, in northern French speaking Switzerland. The municipality covers a section of the undulating land between Lake Neuch√¢tel and the Broye. The central part of the area features the delta of the River Mentue, which flows into Lake Neuch√¢tel. The lakeshore in the region of and surrounding Yvonand is flat, near a belt of reeds and forest. In the southeast the land rises to its highest point, in the municipality, at above sea level, bordering a high plateau with Rovray and Arrissoules, achieving the height of La Baume, which then drops dramatically toward Yvonand. The southern part of the municipality covers the valley of the Mentue, up to wide. On the east side of the River Vaux, the stream has created a valley in the course of millions of years by its erosive strength. Between these two valleys is the high forest, Bois de Montessy, and Ni√©dens. The western delimitation runs by sections along the River Epena, which rises behind the Mont√©la. Neighbouring municipalities of Yvonand are Cheseaux-Nor√©az, Villars-Epeney, Cuarny, Cronay, Donneloye, Molondin and Rovray in Canton Vaud as well as Cheyres in Canton Fribourg.

Transport The municipality is well served thanks to the main road from Yverdon to Estavayer-le-Lac, which traverses the commune and which serves as the High Street to the village. Since 2001, through traffic has bypassed the village thanks to the completion of the Yverdon-les-Bains‚ÄìPayerne section of the A1 motorway (Lausanne‚ÄìBern). This motorway runs across the heights to the south of Yvonand, where the deep valleys of the Mentue and the Vaux had to be spanned, with two impressive viaducts over 100m high (Pont sur la Mentue and Viaduc du Vaux). The nearest motorway junctions are Yverdon Ouest (10 km to the west) and Estavayer-le-Lac (14 km to the east). On 1 February 1877 the Yverdon railway line was extended to Payerne with a station in Yvonand. There is a Post Bus, which serves the municipalities of the hinterland in a circular route.

Electronic countermeasures that alter the electromagnetic, acoustic or other signature(s) of a target thereby altering the tracking and sensing behavior of an incoming threat (e.g., guided missile) are designated soft-kill measures. Measures that physically counterattack an incoming threat thereby destroying/altering its payload/warhead in such a way that the intended effect on the target is severely impeded are designated hard-kill measures. Soft-kill measures Soft-kill measures are applied when it is expected that a sensor-based weapon system can be successfully interfered with. The threat sensor can be either an artificial one, e.g., a solid-state infrared detector, or the human sensory system (eye and/or ear). Soft-kill measures generally interfere with the signature of the target to be protected. In the following the term signature refers to the electromagnetic or acoustic signature of an object in either the ultraviolet (wavelength: 0.3‚Äì0.4 Œºm), visual (0.4‚Äì0.8 Œºm), or infrared (0.8 - 14 Œºm) spectral range as well as cm-radar range (frequency: 2‚Äì18 GHz), mmw- radar (35, 94, 144 GHz) and finally sonar range (either 50 Hz ‚Äì 3 kHz and/or 3‚Äì15 kHz). One or more of the following actions may be taken to provide soft- kill: * Reduction of signature * Augmentation of signature Soft-kill countermeasures can be divided into on-board and expendable countermeasures. Whereas on-board measures are fixed on the platform to be protected, expendable measures are ejected from the platform. Preemptive action of countermeasures is directed to generally prevent lock-on of a threat sensor to a certain target. It is based on altering the signature of the target by either concealing the platform signature or enhancing the signature of the background, thus minimizing the contrast between the two. Reactive action of countermeasures is directed toward break-lock of a threat already homing in on a certain target. It is based on the tactics of signature imitation, augmentation, or reduction. =Aerial countermeasures= Countermeasure Pod of Transall C-160 Generally one has to distinguish between infrared and radar countermeasures. The wavelength range between 0.8 and 5 Œºm is considered as Infrared (IR), the frequency range between 2 and 18 GHz is considered as Radar. Chaff and flare countermeasure block of CH-146 Griffon In the wake of shoulder-launched missile attacks against civilian passenger and cargo airliners in the early 2000s, various agencies investigated the feasibility of equipping countermeasures such as chaff and flares. Many commercial carriers found the estimated price of countermeasures to be too costly. However, the Israeli airline El-Al, having been the target of the failed 2002 airliner attack, in which shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles were fired at an airliner while taking off, began equipping its fleet with radar-based, automated flare release countermeasures from June 2004.John Vause, \\"Missile defense for El Al fleet\\", CNN, May 24, 2004. Accessed July 18, 2006. This caused concerns in some European countries, regarding the possible fire hazard at civilian airports, resulting in banning such aircraft from landing at their airports.Eldad Beck, \\"Europe objects to El Al's anti-missile shield\\", Ynetnews, Feb 26, 2006. Accessed July 18, 2006. In 2007, Saab announced a new infrared countermeasure system called CAMPS that does not use pyrotechnic flares, thereby directly addressing these concerns. =IR-decoy flares= An HH-60H Seahawk helicopter discharges countermeasure flares IR-decoy flares serve to counter infrared-guided surface-to-air missiles (SAM) or air-to-air missiles (AAM) and can be expelled from a craft according to an anticipated threat in defined sequences. =Radar decoys= To counter radar-guided missiles, chaff is used. These are copper nickel-coated glass fibers or silver-coated nylon fibers having lengths equal to half of the anticipated radar wavelength. New systems, such as the BriteCloud expendable active decoy, use DRFM technology to generate a false target, luring the RF threat system away from the aircraft. =Naval decoys= Land and sea-based forces can also use such countermeasures, as well as smoke-screens that can disrupt laser ranging, infrared detection, laser weapons, and visual observation. Hard- kill measures Except for countering intercontinental ballistic missiles, hard-kill measures generally refer to measures taken in the so-called \\"end- game\\" shortly before a warhead/missile hits its target. The hard-kill measure in general physically affects the incoming warhead/missile by means of either blast and/or fragment action. The action may lead to: *disturbance of the stability of a kinetic energy penetrator which will decrease its penetration ability as the deflection angle increases. *premature initiation of a shaped charge (e.g., too great stand-off), but most likely improper initiation, thereby impeding optimum jet development of the metallic lining, usually copper, in the shaped charge. The copper jet provides most of the anti armor capabilities of shaped charge weapons. *destruction of the airframe of an inbound missile or shell. Merkava Mk IVm Windbreaker, fitted with Trophy APS There are many examples of active countermeasures. For example, the Russian- made Arena system utilizes a Doppler radar to detect incoming threats and fires a top attack rocket to eliminate the threat. The Israeli Trophy system fires a shotgun-like blast to destroy the threat. An American system known as Quick Kill detects incoming threats using an Active Electronically Scanned Array, which assesses the threat, and deploys a smaller rocket countermeasure. Another American system, known as Iron Curtain, utilizes two sensors to reduce false alarms and defeat threats inches from their target by firing a kinetic countermeasure designed to minimize collateral damage. The Russian T-14 Armata tank features the Afghanit () active protection system (APS), which includes a millimeter-wavelength radar to detect, track, and intercept incoming anti-tank munitions, both kinetic energy penetrators (reportedly) and tandem-charges. Currently, the maximum speed of the interceptable target is , with projected future increases of up to . According to news sources, it protects the tank from all sides. = Reactive armor = An example of a hard-kill countermeasure is the reactive armor, a sandwich of high explosive material between two armor plates found on many modern armored vehicles. As a penetrator hits the armor, the explosive detonates, which disrupts any plasma jet generated by the penetrator, damaging it.Andrew Feickert, Congressional Research Service R45519 \\"The Army‚Äôs Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) Program: Background and Issues for Congress, Updated October 10, 2019 note 13 = Anti-aircraft weapons = Another example of hard-kill countermeasures is the use of short-range missiles or rapid-fire guns to protect warships and fixed installations from cruise missile, bomb and artillery attacks. =Anti- ballistic missiles= Countermeasures are a complicating factor in the development of anti-ballistic missile defense systems targeting ICBMs. Like aircraft, ICBMs theoretically could evade such systems by deploying decoys and chaff in the midcourse phase of flight. Novel proposed chaff mechanisms describe the creation of a \\"threat cloud\\" by deploying large aluminized PET film balloons which could conceal a warhead among a large number of inert objects having similar radar profiles. Potential performance problems=Clutter= Mountains and neighboring vehicles reflect radio waves, thus creating radar clutter, which adversely affects radar-detection and radar-lock performance. =Top attack munitions= Top attack ATGMs like the FGM-148 Javelin (US) and Trigat (Germany) attack the tank turret's top, requiring the active protection system to attack nearly vertically, for which turret might have not been designed. The same is true for an RPG being fired in a steep downward angle from an elevated location at a target below.

Their line-up initially consisted of violin, cello, oboe and percussion. Most of their performances were instrumental and partly improvised. Nevertheless, their records for the Harvest label, Alchemy and Third Ear Band, achieved some popularity, after which they found some success creating soundtrack music for films. History Dave Tomlin, who had initiated free-form jazz sessions at the London Free School, began similar sessions at the UFO Club by assembling members of the audience, usually at 4am, into a free-form group playing for the, by then, exhausted dancers. The drummer, Glen Sweeney, was sometimes so carried away he had to be told that the rest of the group had finished. They became known as 'The Giant Sun Trolley'. Members came from The Giant Sun Trolley and The People Band to create an improvised music drawing on Eastern raga forms, European folk, experimental and medieval influences. They recorded their first session in 1968 for Ron Geesin which was released under the pseudonym of The National- Balkan Ensemble on one side of a Standard Music Library disc. Their first album, Alchemy, was released on the EMI Harvest label in 1969 and featured John Peel, the BBC disc jockey who did much to publicise the group, playing jaw harp on one track. This was followed by an eponymous second album containing four tracks, \\"Air\\", \\"Earth\\", \\"Fire\\" and \\"Water\\", which reached wider attention due to the inclusion of one track on the Harvest sampler \\"Picnic\\". They recorded two soundtracks, the first in 1970 for an animated film by Herbert Fuchs of Abelard and Heloise (which first saw release as part of Luca Ferrari's Necromancers of the Drifting West Sonic Book in 1997) and then in 1971 for Roman Polanski's film of Macbeth. After various later incarnations and albums they finally disbanded in 1993 owing to leader and percussionist Glen Sweeney's ongoing health problems. They also opened The Rolling Stones Free Concert at Hyde Park on 5 July 1969, and played at the Isle of Wight Festival the next month.

Currently, 850 people work at the institute, about half of them are scientists. The Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry is the only one of the institutes within the Max Planck Society which combines the three classical scientific disciplines ‚Äì biology, physics and chemistry. Founded in 1971, its initial focus was set on physical and chemical problems. It has since undergone a continuous evolution manifested by an expanding range of core subjects and work areas such as neurobiology, biochemistry and molecular biology. To date, four researchers working in the institute (Stefan Hell, 2014; Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann, 1991; Manfred Eigen, 1967) have been awarded by Nobel Prize. On July 8, 2020, both biomedical Max-Planck Institutes in G√∂ttingen, the Max Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine and the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry announced their merger in 2021.  History  Aerial picture of the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, G√∂ttingen (Picture: J√∂rg Winkler, 2007) The history of the Institute goes back to the year 1949. At that time, the Max Planck Society established the Max Planck Institute for Physical Chemistry in G√∂ttingen as follow-up of the former Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry in Berlin. Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer, who already worked at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, became the founding director of the new institute. He was one of the first researchers who applied physical-chemical methods in biological research and thus combined different disciplines of natural sciences in research. The Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry was created in 1971 by merging the Max Planck Institutes for Physical Chemistry and for Spectroscopy in G√∂ttingen. This was mainly initiated by Nobel Prize laureate Manfred Eigen, who was at that time director of the Max Planck Institute for Physical Chemistry. His vision of an interdisciplinary approach to biological research was decisive and the creative impulse for the development of the institute. In honour of Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer, the new institute was named after him. Although the institute is dedicated to basic research ‚Äì by virtue of the charter of the Max Planck Society ‚Äì its policy has been to encourage the transfer of numerous technological innovations to the marketplace. As a consequence, many licensing agreements and start-up firms have arisen from research conducted at the institute, e. g. Lambda Physik (today part of Coherent), DeveloGen (today part of Evotec) and Evotec.  Research = Research Focus = Research at the institute focuses on the fundamental mechanisms that regulate and control life processes: How is genetic information correctly translated into proteins? How do nerve cells communicate with each other? How is cellular logistics controlled? On the organismal level, researchers at the Institute study the circadian rhythms of the vertebrate, or differentiation and development in multicellular organisms. To obtain even deeper insights into the nanocosmos of living cells, the institute employs ultra-high resolution microscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and tomography, mass spectrometry, optical spectroscopy, or atomistic computer simulations. At the same time the Institute concentrates on developing novel measurement and analysis methods to provide a closer look into the world of molecules. = Departments = The Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry currently encompasses 12 departments: * Prof. Patrick Cramer - Molecular Biology In April, 2020, Patrick Cramer's team at the Max Planck Institute of Biophysical Chemistry created the first \\"3D structure of the corona polymerase\\" for the COVID-19 virus.

The focus of this association is the development and application of spatially resolved NMR techniques for non-invasive studies of the central nervous system in animals and humans. These innovative approaches allow for unique insights into the structure, metabolism and function of the intact living brain. Jens Frahm and his coworkers invented a rapid acquisition technique for magnetic resonance imaging termed FLASH MRI (fast low angle shot) technique which allowed for a 100-fold reduction of the measuring times of cross-sectional and three-dimensional images. The FLASH technique led the ground for many modern MRI applications in diagnostic imaging.  International Max Planck Research Schools  In 2000, two International Max Planck Research Schools (IMPRS) were established together with the Georg August University G√∂ttingen, the German Primate Center and the Max Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine: the IMPRS for Molecular Biology and the IMPRS for Neurosciences (in cooperation with the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization and the European Neuroscience Institute G√∂ttingen).

Parton turned the network down, and suggested Chase for the job.Entertainment Weekly article: \\"Err Time: Denise Richards is in good company -- look back at 10 major movie stars who flopped on TV\\". Chase reportedly signed a $3 million deal with Fox. Days before the show's premiere, the name of the venue where the show was recorded was changed from the Aquarius Theater to the Chevy Chase Theater, and Fox spent $1 million in renovations.Entertainment Weekly article: \\"One Down\\". =Formula and trademarks= The Chevy Chase Show was one of several talk shows that various networks put on the air after Johnny Carson retired from hosting the highly-successful The Tonight Show on NBC. The show premiered a week after the first Late Show with David Letterman and a week prior to the first Late Night with Conan O'Brien. In keeping with the formula Carson and David Letterman had established, the show featured a house band that Chase called the best band in the world: the Tom Scott-led MBC Orchestra (which would later be called The Hollywood Express). As with several other late night shows (the most notable exception being the Jay Leno-hosted Tonight Show), Chase secured ownership rights to his show which he produced through his company, Cornelius Productions. The show's set featured a tank with live fish (visible during interviews), basketball hoops, and shelves of toys.,The New York Times article: \\"The Set Makes The Host\\" as well as a desk with a built-in piano. The program's lead-in featured a clay-animated Chase stealing letters from notable Los Angeles landmarks to spell the name of his show. As the credits rolled at the end of each episode, Chase was seen shooting basketballs at an onstage backstop. =Episodes= According to newspaper listings, Chase's guests during the 29-episode run included: *Week of September 6, 1993: Goldie Hawn, Whoopi Goldberg, Jason Priestley, Harry Anderson, Martin Short, Kathleen Turner, Robert Townsend *Week of September 13, 1993: Tom Selleck, Dennis Hopper, Anita Morris, Jennie Garth, Garrett Morris, Al Franken *Week of September 20, 1993: Deborah Allen, Rita Rudner, Engelbert Humperdinck, Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Sinbad, Janis Ian, Robert De Niro, Kenny Loggins, Dean Cain *Week of September 27, 1993: Ron Silver, Jonathan Frakes, Sam Elliott, Pamela Anderson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Henry Rollins *Week of October 4, 1993: Dan Aykroyd, Lauren Tom, Dave Thomas, Queen Latifah, Doug E.

Within 48 hours of the final show, workmen had already dismantled and painted over the Chevy Chase Theater's sign. The theater is now known as Nickelodeon on Sunset. Fox ran reruns of In Living Color in the former time slot of The Chevy Chase Show after the cancellation. In November 1993, Fox was in talks with Howard Stern to replace Chase's show, but the talks went nowhere. With the exceptions of talking with Stern and attempting to sign Conan O'Brien in the early 2000s, Fox has not attempted to air late-night network programming on weeknights since The Chevy Chase Show left the air. In a 2007 interview with Time, Chase spoke of the show, saying that it was \\"an entirely different concept than what was pushed on me. I would never do it again. What I wanted had a whole different feel to it, much darker and more improv. But we never got there.\\"Time article: \\"10 Questions for Chevy Chase\\" In an A&E; Biography on Chase in 2009, Chase explained that because he had signed a contract with Fox, he was obligated to do the show the way the network wanted. During an interview on Norm Macdonald Has a Show, Chase reiterated his dislike of the experience, noting that the only thing he liked about the program was interviewing Robert De Niro. In 2002 TV Guide ranked the show number 16 on its TV Guide's 50 Worst TV Shows of All Time list.

The class has made some significant changes since inception, in 1967 the buoyancy tanks were redesigned to allow the boat to come up after a capsize with little water on board. In the 1980s the class underwent a transition from plywood to fibreglass hulls. In 2000 false floors were added allowing the boat to completely drain of water after a capsize or swamping. Racing is competitive with many previous sailors going on to become world or Olympic Games champions in other classes. The skill level shown at a State or National event is high with racing being completed in up to of wind. Many children however join in for the social side. Sometimes you will get two 11-year-old friends match up to have fun while learning. Other times the younger children look up to the older children as \\"heroes\\". Club racing is often like a friendly \\"family\\" where the focus is on learning. Even at major events \\"Novice\\" (learning) fleets allow the less experienced to compete and enjoy the fun. As the sailors grow they often move onto Flying Eleven (dinghy), 420 (dinghy) or laser dinghy. A quick count would suggest over 30,000 children have been introduced to sailing via the Manly Junior fleet.

Her 1929 play The Danton Case, which examines the conflict between Maximilien Robespierre and Georges Danton, is considered to be one of the most exemplary works about the Revolution, and was adapted (albeit with significant ideological edits) by Polish filmmaker Andrzej Wajda for his 1983 film Danton. Biography Przybyszewska was born Stanis≈Çawa PajƒÖk√≥wna on 1 October 1901, in Krak√≥w. She was the illegitimate child of the Polish impressionist painter Aniela PajƒÖk√≥wna and the writer Stanis≈Çaw Przybyszewski, the latter a famous and notoriously dissolute modernist who was one of the founding members of the Young Poland movement. From 1902-1906 she lived with her mother in Lviv. From 1907 to 1916 she lived in Western Europe. As a child, Przybyszewska traveled across Europe with her mother (Vienna, Munich, Gries near Bolzano, and Paris). Having lost her mother in 1912 (she died in Paris from pneumonia), she changed cities following her guardians. Initially her parents' friends Wac≈Çaw and Zofia Moraczewski paid for the studies, but from 1914 it was Stanis≈Çawa's aunt (her mother's sister) Helena Barli≈Ñska who took care of the girl. Between the ages of ten and fifteen Przybyszewska attended four different schools in three countries: France (Paris), Switzerland (Z√ºrich, 1912-1914), and Austria (Vienna and Oberhollabrunn). In Austria she took violin lessons and began writing poetry and stories which she destroyed, dissatisfied with her own accomplishments. From 1916 to 1919 she attended the Teachers Institute for Women in Krak√≥w. Kosicka and Gerould wrote: \\"(...) she enrolled in the Teachers Institute, a highly regarded training school, which her mother before her had attended. Although she was an outstanding student, Stanis≈Çawa was sharply critical of both how and what she was taught, and she considered herself essentially self-educated, since her own special interests led her to the exact sciences, above all mathematics and astronomy.\\" As a part of her studies she spent the required year of teaching practice at the elementary school in Nowy SƒÖcz. She passed her Gymnasium examinations cum laude in 1920. In August 1919 she met her father for the first time as an adult; the period of initial fascination with his ideas did not last long, and later in life Przybyszewska was very critical about her father's works. In 1920, not without Przybyszewski‚Äôs involvement, Stanis≈Çawa moved to Pozna≈Ñ where she established connections with the expressionistic circle of the journal, The Source, and studied music at the conservatory. She also enrolled into a philology course at the Pozna≈Ñ University and for one term followed a diverse curriculum it proposed: the courses of French and English literature (of the nineteenth and the eighteenth centuries respectively), medieval literature, history of philosophy, Spanish, Latin and Greek languages. In 1922 she moved to Warsaw and found a job as a salesgirl in a Communist bookstore; this employment, in the recent aftermath of the Polish-Soviet War, led to her being arrested for a week in Pozna≈Ñ (her official place of residence) before being released for lack of evidence. Kosicka and Gerould noted that \\"she took only a theoretical interest in Marxism and remained incapable of becoming directly involved in politics. Stanis≈Çawa made not a single lasting friendship during her year in Warsaw, but as a result of her incarceration she grew obsessed with the victims of unjust imprisonment and judicial oppression, starting with Robespierre and going up to Sacco and Vanzetti in her own time.\\" Following her marriage to an artist Jan Panie≈Ñski (from Pozna≈Ñ circle) Stanis≈Çawa moved to Gda≈Ñsk where Panie≈Ñski got a job as an art teacher in Polish Gymnasium (her father had been instrumental in the creation of the school). The couple participated in the activities of a local group Friends of Science and Art. Though not motivated by love, the marriage proved to be a happy one, as they grew attached to each other. It was not, however, very long: in November 1925, while on an art scholarship in Paris, Panie≈Ñski died from cardiac arrest. The next ten years of Przybyszewska's life were marked by growing isolation and dedication to her work. She only left Gda≈Ñsk on a few occasions, one of them being her father's funeral in 1927. There she met her half-sister Iwi Bennet (Dagny Juel's daughter from Przybyszewski), who became, along with her aunt, one of her closest friends and correspondents. Between March 1928 and 9 March 1929 she wrote The Danton Case and as Kosicka and Gerould noted: \\"began to dream of a European career, 'like Conrad', as a way of overcoming her isolation and alienation.\\" She devoted much time to the study of contemporary German literature. From Polish writers she valued Joseph ConradShe wrote in her letter to Helena Barli≈Ñska (18-25 November 1929): \\"I have no doubts whatsoever, either of Conrad's essentially Polish origin, or of his delightful mixture of cultures (apparently he hated Dostoevsky - I can well believe it, since on the one level of their fundamental natures they are as similar as twins); and I do not have the slightest doubt about his being a genius. This foreigner was for England - for Olympian, literary England - a precious find.\\" and Juliusz Kaden-Bandrowski, and considered Stefan ≈ªeromski as having huge talent which didn't develop. She did not have any stable financial income: the state scholarship that she received in unequal amounts from 1929 to 1933 was not enough to survive, so Przybyszewska depended heavily on the support from Barli≈Ñska and Bennet. She lived in poor conditions in the wooden barracks belonging to the Polish Gymnasium. Suffering from poverty and numerous illnesses, she was prescribed increased dosages of morphine by her German doctor Paul Ehmke. Kosicka and Gerould wrote: \\"During the last eight months of Stanis≈Çawa's life, nothing was heard from her; all letters, sent and unsent, stopped. She had grown so weak from gradual emaciation that she could no longer type or hold a pen. Her money gone, even the morphine that had sustained her for so long ran out. On 14 August 1935 in her room am Weissen Turm 1, Baracke Nr. 12, Stanis≈Çawa Przybyszewska died alone, the official cause of death tuberculosis.\\" Works and themes Przybyszewska was fixated upon Maximilien Robespierre, and attributed to him, in her writing, extraordinary brilliance and powers of foresight. \\"I have the calm certainty,\\" she wrote to a friend, \\"that I understand Robespierre better than anyone whose works are known to me.\\" Przybyszewska depicted Robespierre as having predicted the disastrous rise of capitalism. Robespierre was the central figure in both of her surviving plays, The Danton Case (Sprawa Dantona, 1929), and an earlier unfinished play, Thermidor (1925). Reception and legacy British author Hilary Mantel remarks of her that she was \\"the woman who died of Robespierre.\\"LRB ¬∑ Hilary Mantel: ¬ëWhat a man this is, with his crowd of women around him!¬í at www.lrb.co.uk Przybyszewska left a collection of letters written from 1913 to 1934 in several languages to publishers, her friends, and famous European writers like Georges Bernanos, Jean Cocteau, and Thomas Mann; which were published in Gda≈Ñsk in original languages and in Polish in three volumes as Listy (Volume 1 in 1978, Volume 2 in 1983, and Volume 3 in 1985). The production of The Danton Case by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1986 was a realization of the playwright's dream that one day she would be performed in London. This first English-language staging was directed by Ron Daniels and adapted by Pam Gems as The Danton Affair. One of Hilary Mantel's 2017 Reith Lectures on BBC Radio Four, Silence Grips the Town, was delivered in Antwerp and was dedicated to Przybyszewska.

He founded Medtronic, where he developed the first external, battery-operated, transistorized, wearable artificial pacemaker in 1957.Hebrew University of Jerusalem Institute of Chemistry: Earl E. Bakken Early life Born in Columbia Heights, Minnesota, Bakken had a long-held fascination with electricity and electronics. A self-described \\"nerd\\", Bakken designed a rudimentary electroshock weapon in school to fend off bullies. After earning a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering in 1948, he studied electrical engineering with a minor in mathematics at the University of Minnesota Graduate School. Post-World War II hospitals were just starting to employ electronic equipment, but did not have staff to maintain and repair them. Career Sensing an opportunity, with his brother-in-law, Palmer Hermundslie, he formed Medtronic (a portmanteau of \\"medical\\" and \\"electronic\\") in a small garage, primarily working with the University of Minnesota hospital. In the 1950s, Dr. C. Walton Lillehei was performing life-saving surgery on children with blue baby syndrome. That surgery often left the children needing to be temporarily attached to a pacemaker. The pacemakers at the time were large devices that required their own carts and relied on wall current for power. As a result of a power blackout on October 31, 1957, one of Dr. Lillehei's young patients died. Dr. Lillehei, who had worked with Bakken before, asked him the next day if he could solve the problem. Four weeks after finding a circuit diagram for a metronome in Popular Electronics, Bakken delivered a battery-powered transistorized pacemaker about the size of a few decks of cards to Dr. Lillehei. After successfully testing the hand-made device in the laboratory, Bakken returned to create a refined model for patients. However, much to his astonishment, when he came in the next day, he found the pacemaker already in use on a patient. (The Food and Drug Administration did not start regulating medical devices until 1976.) Over the next several years, Bakken and Medtronic worked with other doctors to develop fully implantable pacemakers, but they also veered toward bankruptcy. He borrowed money that kept Medtronic going, but the bankruptcy near-miss drove Bakken to develop the Medtronic Mission, which still guides the company.Medtronic's Patient-Focussed Mission medtronic.com The mission helped the young company to stay focused on areas where it could truly help patients. Bakken retired from Medtronic in 1989 and moved to a 9-acre estate in the Kona District of Hawaii he called Bakken Hale, but still returned to the company several times a year to meet new employees and explain the Medtronic Mission to them in person. In 1996 he helped to dedicate the North Hawaii Community Hospital and was active there for some time afterwards, working to combine Eastern and Western approaches to medicine to develop a more holistic approach to health care. In 2001, Medtronic started the construction of its new European distribution center in Heerlen, The Netherlands. The street on which the facility was built is named after Bakken.

Under the doctrine, a gift that the maker of the will (the testator) gives during his lifetime to a named beneficiary of the will is treated as an advance payment of that beneficiary's inheritance. If the probate court determines that the testator intended the lifetime gift to satisfy a bequest under the will, the amount of the lifetime gift is deducted from the amount that the beneficiary would have received under the will. Application In the United States, state law determines which lifetime gifts are treated as gifts in satisfaction of a bequest. Under the Uniform Probate Code, ¬ß 2-609, a lifetime gift is treated as satisfaction of a legacy only if (i) the will provides for deduction of the gift, (ii) the testator indicated in a contemporaneous writing that the lifetime gift was intended to satisfy a legacy in the will, or (iii) the gift recipient acknowledged in writing that the gift was intended to satisfy a legacy in the will.https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartII/TitleII/Chapter190B/ArticleII/Section2-609 Courts may presume that gifts of money from a parent to a child after the execution of the parent's will are gifts in satisfaction of the child's legacy under the will, even without a written indication of intent to satisfy the provision under the will. Courts are reluctant to apply the doctrine to certain kinds of legacies, for example, devises of specific real estate or bequests of personal property. These specific legacies are viewed by courts as unique and not able to be replaced with a lifetime gift of money or other property. When the probate court determines that the doctrine applies to a lifetime gift made to a will beneficiary, the amount beneficiary's gift under the will is reduced by the amount the beneficiary has already received. For example, if the will bequeaths $5,000 to a beneficiary, but the beneficiary received a lifetime gift of $4,000 from testator that was intended to partially satisfy the gift under the will, the beneficiary will receive only $1,000 under the will. If the will provides that the beneficiary receives a percentage of the testator's estate, the court may engage in a hotchpot calculation to determine the amount, if any, that the beneficiary should receive under the will. If the value of the lifetime gift received is greater than the beneficiary's calculated share under the will, the beneficiary receives nothing under the will, but does not return any of the lifetime gifts.

The term was first reported in a 2004 USA Today article describing the effect being made on trial jurors by television programs featuring forensic science. It most often refers to the belief that jurors have come to demand more forensic evidence in criminal trials, thereby raising the effective standard of proof for prosecutors. While this belief is widely held among American legal professionals, some studies have suggested that crime shows are unlikely to cause such an effect, although frequent CSI viewers may place a lower value on circumstantial evidence. As technology improves and becomes more prevalent throughout society, people may also develop higher expectations for the capabilities of forensic technology. Background The CSI effect is named for CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, a television program which first aired in 2000. In CSI, a fictional team of crime scene investigators solve murders in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. In each episode, the discovery of a human corpse leads to a criminal investigation by members of the team, who gather and analyze forensic evidence, question witnesses, and apprehend suspects. The show's popularity led to three spin-offs: CSI: Miami, which debuted in 2002, CSI: NY, first aired in 2004, and CSI: Cyber, which premiered in 2015. The CSI franchise's success resulted in the production of many similar shows. The \\"CSI effect\\" has been associated with drama and true crime television series that preceded CSI, such as American Justice, Cold Case Files, Cold Squad, Exhibit A: Secrets of Forensic Science, Forensic Files, Silent Witness, Waking the Dead; and others that followed, including Bones, Cold Case, Criminal Minds, Crossing Jordan, NCIS, Numb3rs, Wire in the Blood, and Without a Trace. Based on the Nielsen ratings, six of the top ten most popular television shows in the United States in 2005 were crime dramas, and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation reached the number one ranking in November 2007. Several aspects of popular crime shows have been criticized as being unrealistic. For instance, the show's characters not only investigate (\\"process\\") crime scenes, but they also conduct raids, engage in suspect pursuit and arrest, interrogate suspects, and solve cases, which falls under the responsibility of uniformed officers and detectives, not CSI personnel. Additionally, if CSIs process a crime scene it is inappropriate for them to also be involved in the examination and testing of any evidence collected from that scene as it would compromise the impartiality of scientific evidence. In real investigations, DNA and fingerprint data are often unobtainable and, when they are available, can take several weeks or months to process, whereas television crime labs usually get results within hours. In the first season of CSI, technicians made a plaster mold of the interior of a wound to determine the type of knife used to make the wound, which is not possible with current technology. Characters on television often use the word \\"match\\" to describe a definitive relationship between two pieces of evidence, whereas real forensic technicians tend to use terms that are less definite, which acknowledges that absolute certainty is often not possible. Anthony E. Zuiker, creator of the CSI franchise, claimed that \\"all of the science is accurate\\" on the shows; researchers, however, have described CSI portrayal of forensic science as \\"high-tech magic\\". Forensic scientist Thomas Mauriello estimated that 40 percent of the scientific techniques depicted on CSI do not exist. In addition to using unrealistic techniques, CSI ignores all elements of uncertainty present in real investigations, and instead portrays experimental results as absolute truth. The notion that these inaccurate portrayals could alter the public perception of forensic evidence was dubbed the \\"CSI effect\\", a term which began to appear in mainstream media as early as 2004. Under this effect, victims and their families ‚Äì and jurors ‚Äì are coming to expect instant answers from showcased techniques such as DNA analysis and fingerprinting, when actual forensic processing often takes days or weeks, with no guarantee of revealing a \\"smoking gun\\" for the prosecution's case. District attorneys state that the conviction rate in cases with little physical evidence has decreased, largely due to the influence of CSI on jury members. By 2009 more than 250 stories about the CSI effect had appeared in newspapers and magazines, including articles in National Geographic, Scientific American, and U.S. News & World Report. Research findings Although the CSI effect is a recent phenomenon, it has long been recognized that media portrayals of the United States legal system are capable of significantly altering public awareness, knowledge, and opinions of it. An attorney told The New York Times in 1990 that \\"Any lawyer who doesn't watch L.A. Law the night before he's going to trial is a fool\\". A 2002 juror survey showed that viewers of the popular court show Judge Judy were greatly misinformed about the purpose of the judge within a courtroom. Earlier programs which may have affected public perception of \\"the legal or investigative systems\\" include Perry Mason (1957‚Äì1966), Quincy, M.E. (1976‚Äì1983) and the Law & Order franchise (1990‚Äìpresent). News media reports on criminal trials, extensive internet blogging, and the successes of the Innocence Project have also contributed to the increased public awareness of forensic science. Zuiker has stated that The CSI Effect' is, in my opinion, the most amazing thing that has ever come out of the series.\\" The CSI effect is described by researchers N. J. Schweiter and Michael J. Saks as a reference to the alleged phenomenon of CSI raising crime victims' and jury members' real-world expectations of forensic science, especially crime scene investigation and DNA testing. N. J. Schweitzer and Michael J. Saks The CSI Effect: Popular Fiction About Forensic Science Affects Public Expectations About Real Forensic Science. Jurimetrics , Spring 2007 Donald E. Shelton, Young S. Kim and Gregg Barak have said it has changed the way many trials are presented today, in that prosecutors are pressured to deliver more forensic evidence in court.Donald E. Shelton, Young S. Kim and Gregg Barak A Study of Juror Expectations and Demands Concerning Scientific Evidence: Does the 'CSI Effect' Exist? Vanderbilt Journal of Entertainment & Technology Law In 2006, the evidence cited in support of the supposed effect was mainly anecdotes from law enforcement personnel and prosecutors, and allegedly little empirical examination of the effect had been done, and the one study published by then suggested the phenomenon may be an urban myth. A survey conducted by Donald E. Shelton on 1,027 potential jurors in Ann Arbor, Michigan revealed that while CSI viewers had higher expectations for scientific evidence than non-CSI viewers, in most cases, scientific evidence was not needed in order to reach a verdict. However, more recent research suggests that these modern TV shows do have a misleading influence on public perceptions and expectations, and juror behavior.Alldredge, John \\"The 'CSI Effect' and Its Potential Impact on Juror Decisions,\\" (2015) Themis: Research Journal of Justice Studies and Forensic Science: Vol. 3: Iss. 1, Article 6., retrieved 31 May 2017 Citing the \\"CSI effect\\", at least one researcher has suggested screening jurors for their level of influence from such TV programs. Manifestations=Trials= The popularity of forensic crime television shows supposedly gives rise to many misconceptions about the nature of forensic science and investigation procedures among jury members. The CSI effect is hypothesized to affect verdicts in two main ways: first, that jurors expect more forensic evidence than is available or necessary, resulting in a higher rate of acquittal when such evidence is absent; and second, that jurors have greater confidence in forensic and particularly DNA evidence than is warranted, resulting in a higher rate of conviction when such evidence is present. While these and other effects may be caused by crime shows, the most commonly reported effect is that jurors are wrongly acquitting defendants despite overwhelming evidence of guilt. In particular, prosecutors have reported feeling pressured to provide DNA evidence even when eyewitness testimony is available. In fact, in a study of 444 prosecutors, 56% believed the CSI Effect to almost always or always influence juries, and 81% believed the CSI Effect to influence judges. In one highly publicized incident, Los Angeles County, California District Attorney Steve Cooley blamed actor Robert Blake's acquittal on murder charges on the CSI effect. Cooley noted that the not guilty verdict came despite two witness accounts of Blake's guilt, and claimed that the jury members were \\"incredibly stupid\\". By 2005, some judges and prosecutors had begun altering their trial preparations and procedures in an attempt to counter the CSI effect. Some ask questions about crime drama television viewership during voir dire to target biased jurors. For example, in Charles and Drake v. State (2010), the defendants were convicted of second degree murder, and during voir dire, the judge presented a question about the CSI Effect. In this case, the Maryland appellate court ruled the CSI Effect voir dire question inappropriate due to its biased language and use of the term \\"convict\\" without mention of acquittal.Charles and Drake v. State, 997 A.2d 154 (2010). Prosecutors have also used opening statements and closing arguments to minimize the possible impact of the CSI effect. In Goff v. State (2009), the prosecutor asked jurors during voir dire about their ability to render a verdict without scientific evidence, and then reminded them during closing arguments about this question.Goff v. State, 14 So.3d 625 (2009). In this case, the mention of the CSI Effect was considered acceptable because the language used was neutral and unbiased. Additionally, jury instructions have also been used as a means of informing jurors about the CSI Effect. In Atkins v. State (2011), the jury was instructed that scientific evidence is not necessary for a case to be valid.Atkins v. State, 26 A.3d 979 (2011). The court ruled that this jury instruction regarding scientific evidence was improper because the State was not held to its burden of proof. Furthermore, prosecutors have hired expert witnesses to explain why particular forms of physical evidence are not relevant to their cases. In one Australian murder case, the defense counsel requested a judge-only trial to avoid having DNA evidence misinterpreted by a jury. By 2006, the CSI effect had become widely accepted as reality among legal professionals, despite little empirical evidence to validate or disprove it. A 2008 survey by researcher Monica Robbers showed that roughly 80 percent of all American legal professionals believed they had had decisions affected by forensic television programs. New York University professor Tom R. Tyler argued that, from a psychological standpoint, crime shows are more likely to increase the rate of convictions than acquittals, as the shows promote a sense of justice and closure which is not attained when a jury acquits a defendant. The perceived rise in the rate of acquittals may be related to sympathy for the defendant or declining confidence in legal authorities. A 2006 survey of U.S. university students reached a similar conclusion: the influence of CSI is unlikely to burden prosecutors, and may actually help them. One of the largest empirical studies of the CSI effect was undertaken in 2006 by Washtenaw County Circuit Court Judge Donald Shelton and two researchers from Eastern Michigan University. They surveyed more than 1,000 jurors, and found that while juror expectations for forensic evidence had increased, there was no correlation between viewership of crime shows and tendency to convict. One alternate explanation for the changing perception of forensic evidence is the so-called \\"tech effect\\": as technology improves and becomes more prevalent throughout society, people develop higher expectations for the capabilities of forensic technology. Shelton described one instance in which a jury member complained because the prosecution had not dusted the lawn for fingerprints, a procedure which is impossible and had not been demonstrated on any crime show. A later study by the same authors found that frequent CSI viewers may place a lower value on circumstantial evidence, but their viewership had no influence on their evaluation of eyewitness testimony or their tendency to convict in cases with multiple types of evidence. Many stories about the CSI effect assume that there has been an increase in acquittal rates, though this is often based entirely on anecdotal evidence. A 2009 study of conviction statistics in eight states found that, contrary to the opinions of criminal prosecutors, the acquittal rate has decreased in the years since the debut of CSI. The outcome of any given trial is much more strongly dependent on the state in which it took place, rather than whether it occurred before or after the CSI premiere. A 2010 study by the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee suggests that, while there may be a correlation between crime show viewership and a perceived understanding of DNA evidence, there was no evidence that such viewership affected jury decision making. As of August 2010, no empirical evidence has demonstrated a correlation between CSI viewership and acquittal rates. One researcher suggested that the perception of a CSI effect‚Äîand of other courtroom effects, such as Perry Mason syndrome and white coat syndrome‚Äîis caused not by the incompetence of jury members, but by a general distrust of the jury system as a whole. =Academia= The CSI effect has influenced the manner in which forensic scientists are educated and trained. In the past, those who sought to enter the field of forensics typically earned an undergraduate degree in a science, followed by a master's degree. However, the popularity of programs such as CSI has caused an increase in the demand for undergraduate courses and graduate programs in forensic science. In 2004, the forensics programs at Florida International University and the University of California, Davis, doubled in size, reportedly as a result of the CSI effect. However, many students enter such programs with unrealistic expectations. Vocational interest in forensic science has proliferated among students in countries besides the United States, including Australia, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The increased popularity of the forensic science program at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland has also been attributed to the CSI effect. Although the increased popularity of forensics programs means there are more applicants for jobs at crime labs, there is some concern that these courses do not adequately prepare students for real forensics work, as graduates often lack a firm grasp of basic scientific principles that would come from a science degree. Many forensics students are presented with streamlined exercises with overly clear answers, which may give them distorted perceptions of the power of forensic science. The Albuquerque Police Department has attempted to improve scientific literacy among future forensic scientists and jurors alike by developing a \\"Citizen CSI\\" course which familiarizes local citizens with the \\"capabilities and limitations of authentic forensic science techniques.\\" While forensic crime shows are often criticized for portraying technologies that do not exist, these may inspire inventors and research teams, as it is not uncommon for scientific innovations to be first portrayed in science fiction. =Crimes= The CSI effect may also alter how crimes are committed. In 2000, the year that CSI: Crime Scene Investigation debuted, 46.9 percent of all rape cases in the United States were resolved by police. By 2005, the rate had fallen to 41.3 percent. Some investigators attributed this decline to the CSI effect, as crime shows often inadvertently explain in detail how criminals can conceal or destroy evidence. Several rape victims have reported that their assailants forced them to shower or clean themselves with bleach after their assaults. In December 2005, Jermaine McKinney broke into a home in Trumbull County, Ohio, where he murdered two women. A fan of CSI, McKinney went to unusual lengths to remove evidence of his crime: he cleaned his hands with bleach, burned the bodies and his clothing, and attempted to dispose of the murder weapon in a lake. McKinney was eventually apprehended. Ray Peavy, head of the Los Angeles County homicide division, commented that, in addition to teaching criminals how to conceal evidence, crime shows may even \\"encourage them when they see how simple it is to get away with [it] on television.\\" Others argue that shows like CSI are not having any educational effect on criminals. Max Houck, director of the Forensic Science Initiative at West Virginia University, said although CSI may be educating criminals, people who resort to a life of crime generally are not very intelligent to begin with. It is also possible that crime shows have the opposite effect, if attempts to conceal evidence generate more evidence. Houck gave an example of criminals who avoided licking envelopes because of the DNA in their saliva, but left fingerprints and hair samples on adhesive tape instead. Tammy Klein, the lead investigator on the McKinney case, said that the killings she investigates are committed by people \\"who for the most part are pretty stupid.\\" Larry Pozner, former president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, argued that because people who commit violent crimes generally do not take precautions, television forensics programs are unlikely to have any effect on their behavior. Convicted serial rapist Jonathan Haynes forced his victims to destroy forensic evidence. He was only caught after one of his victims deliberately pulled out her own hair which was later discovered in his car, tying him to the attacks. She was inspired by watching the CSI television series. =Police investigations= Law enforcement officers often receive inquiries and demands about their investigations that stem from unrealistic portrayals on television. In a 2010 survey of Canadian police officers, some were frustrated by these CSI-affected queries, though most saw them as opportunities to inform the public about real police work. New technologies and the increased public awareness of forensic science have stimulated new interest in solving cold cases and encouraged higher accountability among police investigators. However, the increased demand for forensic evidence can cause an unmanageable workload for forensic laboratories. Some crime labs process several thousand cases every year. Many law enforcement agencies have insufficient storage space for the increasing amount of physical evidence they collect. In some investigations, DNA evidence is not collected simply because there is not enough space to store it properly.

As of the 2010 census it had a permanent population of 40. Summerhaven sits at an elevation of approximately above sea level. Summerhaven is accessed via the Catalina Highway from suburban northeast Tucson, and it is about from the base of the mountains to Summerhaven. History White Anglo-Americans originally used the area of Summerhaven when the U.S. Army at Fort Lowell in Tucson put a military camp there in its defense against the Apache in the 1870s and 1880s. As to white settlement of the vicinity, the Ransier School in Carter Canyon, run by Lydia Ransier and 'Auntie' Broadbent, had two cabins, the larger log one being built in 1912, \\"one of the oldest cabins on the mountain.\\"Mary Ellen Barnes, The Road to Mount Lemmon, Univ. Arizona Press, 2009, pp. 8-9\\" Geography House in Summerhaven Summerhaven is located in the Santa Catalina Mountains and is surrounded by pine trees. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Summerhaven CDP has a total area of , almost all of which is land. Climate Due to its high elevation of , Summerhaven experiences moderately warm summers and cool snowy winters. Yearly snowfall averages can be significant, on average reaching a year. A windstorm hit Summerhaven in May 2010 and caused extensive damage to the forest around it. Some trails were severely damaged, although repair efforts were underway. The climate could be classified as a subtropical highland climate. Demographics In 2010, the population of the Summerhaven census-designated place was 40. Note that this includes only people who were living in Summerhaven on the day of the census, thus excluding many part-time or seasonal residents. As of the 2010 census, the racial composition of Summerhaven was: * White: 75.0% (Non-Hispanic Whites: 70.0%) * Black or African American: 0% * Native American: 15.0% * Asian: 10.0% * Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander: 0% * Some other race: 0% * Two or more races: 0% Tourism and recreation Summerhaven is a popular tourist destination. Several small shops in Summerhaven attract visitors, including the Mount Lemmon General Store and The Cookie Cabin, which offers homemade cookies and pizzas. In the winter, residents from lower elevations travel to Summerhaven, when the Catalina Highway is open, to enjoy the snow. Also during the summer, the same residents will frequent the area to get away from the heat. Because of the elevation difference between the Tucson area (5‚Äì6000 feet), the temperature in Summerhaven will be anywhere from 15-30 degrees F cooler depending on weather patterns, which usually makes it a very comfortable place to be compared to the hot desert heat in the summer time. October 2010 saw the inaugural running of the Mount Lemmon Marathon, in which nearly 800 participants finished the race from near the start of the Catalina Highway up to Summerhaven. =Mount Lemmon Ski Valley= The Mount Lemmon Ski Valley located outside Summerhaven is the southernmost ski location in the continental United States. Aspen Fire Burnt pine trees, snow, and a cabin among the stark landscape after the Aspen Fire in 2003 The Aspen wildfire struck Summerhaven in the summer of 2003, which resulted in the destruction of more than 250 of the 700 homes in the community. Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano assessed the damage, and both federal and county officials surveyed the extensive loss. In the months that followed, Tucson residents organized \\"Lemmon Aid\\" to help rebuild Summerhaven. Summerhaven continues to recover from the wildfire. City services There is a general store and several food venues, but no gasoline or automotive services. The Mount Lemmon Fire Department maintains a station near Summerhaven, providing fire and EMS services.

In 1959, The New York Times called him \\"one of the best-known trumpeters in this country.\\" Performing career Among the most influential trumpet performers and teachers of the twentieth century, Voisin joined the Boston Symphony Orchestra as assistant principal trumpet in 1935 at age seventeen, and became principal trumpet in 1950. He performed in the Boston Symphony for 38 years, until 1973. During this period, he was also principal trumpet with the Boston Pops Orchestra. Voisin moved to the United States as a child when his father, Ren√© Voisin (1893‚Äì1952), was brought to the Boston Symphony as fourth trumpet by Sergei Koussevitzky in 1928. He was initially a student of his father, but he later studied with the Boston Symphony's second trumpet Marcel LaFosse (1894‚Äì1969) and principal trumpet Georges Mager (1885‚Äì1950). He also studied solfege with Boston Symphony contrabassist Gaston Dufresne. He is credited with premiere performances of many major works for trumpet including Paul Hindemith's Sonata for Trumpet and Piano (with Hindemith at the piano), and Alan Hovhannes' Prayer of St. Gregory. He is also credited with the US premiere of Alexander Arutiunian's Trumpet Concerto, performing with the Boston Pops Orchestra in 1966. Leroy Anderson's A Trumpeter's Lullaby was written for Roger Voisin in 1949, and first recorded with Arthur Fiedler conducting Voisin and the Boston Pops Orchestra in 1950. Leroy Anderson states that \\"(A Trumpeter's Lullaby) had its beginning backstage at Symphony Hall in Boston. In addition to composing and conducting, I was arranger for the Boston Pops Orchestra for a number of years --- and after one of the concerts I was sitting talking with the conductor Arthur Fiedler and the first trumpet of the Boston Pops, Roger Voisin. Suddenly Roger Voisin asked me why I didn't write a trumpet solo for him to play with the orchestra that would be different from traditional trumpet solos which are all loud, martial or triumphant. After thinking it over, it occurred to me that I had never heard a lullaby for trumpet so I set out to write one --- with a quiet melody based on bugle notes played by the trumpet and with the rest of the orchestra playing a lullaby background.\\" He has also been involved with many early recordings and performances of both solo and orchestral works including J. S. Bach's Brandenburg Concerto #2, B√©la Bart√≥k's Concerto for Orchestra, Aaron Copland's Quiet City, Joseph Haydn's Concerto for Trumpet in Eb, Alexander Scriabin's The Poem of Ecstasy, Georg Philipp Telemann's Concerto for Trumpet in D, and Antonio Vivaldi's Concerto for Two Trumpets in C. Teaching career Roger Voisin was with the Boston Symphony at the inception of the Tanglewood Music Center in 1940, and continued to serve on the faculty there, coaching the orchestral winds and teaching solf√®ge to the conducting class, until his death in 2008. He became chair of the New England Conservatory of Music (NEC) brass and percussion department in 1950 and was the primary trumpet teacher at NEC for nearly 30 years. In 1975 he became a full professor at Boston University, teaching trumpet and chairing the wind, percussion and harp department until his retirement in 1999. In 1989 Voisin donated much of his personal music library to Boston University, where it is housed in the Mugar Library's \\"Special Music Collections\\". He was awarded an honorary Doctorate from the New England Conservatory in 1991, along with legendary jazz trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie. He has served on the jury of the Maurice Andr√© trumpet competition since 1988. His students are found performing in orchestras and teaching at conservatories and universities throughout the world.

Plot Loosely picking up where Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo (1977) left off, protagonist Pete Stancheck (Stephan W. Burns) has inherited Herbie from his uncle Jim Douglas and travels to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico with his friend Davy \\"D.J.\\" Johns (Charles Martin Smith) to retrieve the car. There, they befriend Paco (Joaquin Garay III), a comically mischievous, orphaned pickpocket. Pete and D.J. board the Sun Princess, a cruise ship, to Rio de Janeiro to enter Herbie in the Brazil Grand Pr√™mio, while Paco follows hidden in Herbie's cargo compartment. En route they meet an anthropology student named Melissa (Elyssa Davalos) and her extravagant, eccentric aunt Louise (Cloris Leachman), who is trying to find a husband for her niece. When Herbie wreaks havoc on board, Pete pretends to court Melissa, intending that her Aunt Louise will sponsor their race. Meanwhile, Herbie helps Paco, who has dubbed the car 'Ocho', escape captivity. When the ship's Captain Blythe (Harvey Korman) has his costume party wrecked by the boy and car, he has Herbie dropped into the sea. However, later on land, a rusty Herbie resurfaces from the water to reunite with Paco, who then goes into business with Herbie as a taxi. Thereafter follow three villains (John Vernon, Alex Rocco, and Richard Jaeckel) seeking to capture an antique gold disc, and to find Paco as earlier he had pickpocketed their wallets which contained important film by threatening to use an acetylene torch to cut up Herbie; Herbie's matador part in a bullfight; romance between Aunt Louise and Captain Blythe; and bananas initially used to conceal Herbie among farm vehicles traveling to market and later used by Herbie and Paco to stop the villains escaping justice by having them trip over bananas and Herbie wrecking their airplane to prevent them from getting away. The villains are captured by the police, and the protagonists re-unite on the Sun Princess. Pete and Davy resume their plans to enter Herbie in the Brazil Grand Pr√™mio with Paco dressed as the driver (Pete concedes that Paco and Herbie have a better connection than Pete would have if he drove Herbie in the race). Davy finally asks Paco why he keeps referring to Herbie as \\"Ocho\\", since that is Spanish for eight. Paco looks at Herbie's \\"53\\" and remarks that 5+3=8. After that Pete, Davy, Aunt Louise, and Melissa have a toast hoping for Herbie to win the race with Paco giving Herbie a thumbs up.

Most film critics remarked that the series felt tired, and had run its course, with Leonard Maltin commenting that there was \\"one amusing scene where the VW turns matador; otherwise, strictly scrap metal.\\" Maltin (who rated the film 1¬Ω out of 4) added that the plot dealt with its cast \\"encountering all sorts of 'hilarious' obstacles along the way.\\" Phil Patton, author of the book Bug: The Strange Mutations of the World's Most Famous Automobile, observed that the Herbie franchise was \\"a game of diminishing returns: Herbie Goes Bananas...is filled with 'south of the border' clich√©s and stereotypes.\\" The film has a 40% rating on the website Rotten Tomatoes. Cars The prop Herbie dropped into the ocean was retrieved in 2014. A total of 26 VW Beetles were used, by reason of the quantity of stunts and tricks. Novelization A paperback novelization of the film was written by Joe Claro and published by Scholastic Paperbacks in July 1980 to coincide with the film's release.\\"Herbie Goes Bananas\\" by Joe Claro (Scholastic Paperbacks, 1980), retrieved July 15, 2015.

He was born in Queenston in 1802, the son of Robert Hamilton. He was educated in Queenston and Edinburgh, Scotland and first worked as a clerk in Montreal, Quebec. In 1824, with his stepbrother Robert, he established the Queenston Steamboat Company which operated a number of ships transporting goods on Lake Ontario. In 1831, he was appointed to the Legislative Council of Upper Canada for Queenston and, in 1841, he was re-appointed to its successor, the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada for Canada West. In the 1840s, due to increasing competition, he moved to Kingston, where he operated a business moving goods between Kingston and Montreal. In 1857, after his former competitors had gone bankrupt, he began operating on Lake Ontario again. In 1847, he became president of the Commercial Bank of the Midland District. Although his relationship with the bank was useful to his shipping business, his lack of attention to the bank's business may have contributed to its failure. He was a co-founder of Queen's College at Kingston, later Queen's University, and became chairman of the board of trustees in 1842. A Conservative, he was appointed to the Senate on 23 October 1867 by royal proclamation following the Canadian Confederation of 1867. He served in that capacity, representing the province of Ontario and Kingston until his death. He died at Kingston in 1882.

Small graduated from Yale University and the University of Michigan, from which he earned both a law degree and a master's in environmental policy. His first position was as staff attorney for the Conservation Law Foundation. His songs often make a political or ethical statement. Among his best-known songs are \\"Heart of the Appaloosa\\", \\"Everything Possible\\", \\"Peace Is\\", and \\"Cranes Over Hiroshima\\". He was hailed by Pete Seeger as \\"one of America's best songwriters\\". His debut album, Love's Gonna Carry Us (1981), featured Small singing and accompanying himself on guitar. As his fame and success increased, so too did the production level of his albums, as he included more instrumentation, and appearances by other artists, including instrumental and vocal backing by popular New England folk artists. Famous fiddlers, guitarists, and mandolin players alike became a part of Small's discography and helped Small increase his popularity. After graduating from Harvard Divinity School, he became the minister of First Church Unitarian in Littleton, Massachusetts in 1996.

The quantity of outsourcing, subcontracting of items, overtime of labour, numbers to be hired and fired in each period and the amount of inventory to be held in stock and to be backlogged for each period are decided. All of these activities are done within the framework of the company ethics, policies, and long term commitment to the society, community and the country of operation. Aggregate planning has certain pre-required inputs which are inevitable. They include: *Information about the resources and the facilities available. *Demand forecast for the period for which the planning has to be done. *Cost of various alternatives and resources. This includes cost of holding inventory, ordering cost, cost of production through various production alternatives like subcontracting, backordering and overtime. *Organizational policies regarding the usage of above alternatives. \\"Aggregate Planning is concerned with matching supply and demand of output over the medium time range, up to approximately 12 months into the future. The term aggregate implies that the planning is done for a single overall measure of output or, at the most, a few aggregated product categories. The aim of aggregate planning is to set overall output levels in the near to medium future in the face of fluctuating or uncertain demands.

Among the most successful songs that he has co-written in his career are \\"Do Wah Diddy Diddy\\", \\"Da Doo Ron Ron\\", \\"Then He Kissed Me\\", \\"Be My Baby\\", \\"Chapel of Love\\", and \\"River Deep - Mountain High\\" (all written with his then-wife Ellie Greenwich and Phil Spector); \\"Leader of the Pack\\" (written with Greenwich and Shadow Morton); and \\"Sugar, Sugar\\" (written with Andy Kim). Early career Barry was born in Brooklyn to a Jewish family. His parents divorced when he was seven, and his mother moved him and his sister to Plainfield, New Jersey, where they resided for several years before returning to New York.Cooper, Kim; Smay, David; and Austen, Jake. \\"Bubblegum Music is the Naked Truth\\", p. 126. Feral House, 2001. . Accessed September 21, 2015. \\"Jeff Barry: I was born in Brooklyn. When I was about seven, my parents got divorced, and I moved in with my mom and sister in Plainfield, New Jersey.\\" After graduating from Erasmus Hall High School, Barry served in the Army, then returned to New York where he attended City College. Although he leaned toward a degree in engineering, his main aspiration was to become a singer. He left college in the late '50s to sign with RCA Records, courtesy of music publisher Arnold Shaw. Around this time, he adopted a new name more in tune with show business, borrowing \\"Jeff\\" from actor Jeff Chandler and \\"Barry\\" from family friends. Barry recorded several singles for RCA label, including the self-penned \\"It's Called Rock and Roll\\", backed with \\"Hip Couple\\", released in 1959. The following year, Barry garnered his first significant success as a songwriter with two songs targeting the burgeoning teen market. First, Sam Cooke took Barry's \\"Teenage Sonata\\" to No. 22 on the Billboard R&B; charts. Later that year, the teen-tragedy ballad \\"Tell Laura I Love Her\\", written with lyricist Ben Raleigh, went to No. 1 on the U.S. pop charts for Ray Peterson and to No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart for British singer Ricky Valance. In the 1960s, Barry would partner, both professionally and personally, with Ellie Greenwich to form one of the decade's most prolific songwriting and producing teams. The two met in late 1959, although it might not have been for the first time ‚Äì her maternal uncle was married to his cousin, so they may actually have known each other since childhood. However, their first formal meeting as adults was at a Thanksgiving dinner at the home of mutual relatives. (A few sources erroneously cite the year as 1960.) Fueled by a shared interest in music, a friendship developed that led to romantic involvement some months later, after Barry's first marriage was annulled. In the summer of 1960, Barry and Greenwich recorded Barry's \\"Red Corvette\\", which was released as a single under the name Ellie Gee and The Jets. Greenwich stayed in college at Hofstra (she would graduate in 1962) and commuted to the Brill Building whenever time permitted. Songwriter-producers Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller had offered her a job as a staff writer for Trio Music, their publishing company, after Leiber overheard her singing in an office at the Brill Building. Barry was subsequently signed to Trio as well. At first, Barry and Greenwich continued to write songs with other partners. In addition, both became in-demand demo singers. Some of Barry's demos ended up in the hands of Elvis Presley and other major artists of the day.  Chart Success Barry and Greenwich married in October 1962 and shortly afterward decided to write songs exclusively with each other. Greenwich introduced Barry to her latest partner, songwriter-producer Phil Spector, and the threesome went on to help define the \\"Girl Group\\" sound of the early 1960s. The Barry‚ÄìGreenwich‚ÄìSpector team composed several of Spector's biggest hits, including The Crystals' \\"Da Doo Ron Ron\\" and \\"Then He Kissed Me,\\" and The Ronettes' \\"Be My Baby\\" and \\"Baby, I Love You\\", as well as the holiday perennial \\"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)\\" by Darlene Love. In early 1963, Barry and Greenwich had chart success with \\"What A Guy\\" and \\"The Kind of Boy You Can't Forget\\", recorded by the couple under the name The Raindrops for Jubilee Records, with Greenwich providing all the female vocals through the process of overdubbing, while Barry sang backgrounds in a bass voice. (Greenwich's sister, Laura, was drafted for live performances by The Raindrops, though she was little more than a prop, singing into a dead microphone.) The Raindrops also recorded a Jubilee single in late 1963 called \\"That Boy John\\" a catchy fusion of jazz and rhythm and blues that reached the middle of the charts; President John F. Kennedy had just been assassinated and, according to Barry and Greenwich, radio stations were loath to play the song. However, in a twist of fate, the B side written by Barry and Greenwich was \\"Hanky Panky\\", which would resurface in 1966 as a No. 1 cover version for Tommy James & The Shondells, giving that group its first hit. In 1964, Leiber and Stoller brought Barry and Greenwich on board their new label, Red Bird Records, as songwriter-producers. Of Red Bird's first 20 releases, 15 hit the charts; all were written and/or produced by the Barry-Greenwich team, including \\"Chapel of Love\\", \\"People Say\\", and \\"Iko Iko\\" by The Dixie Cups, and \\"Remember (Walkin' in the Sand)\\" (co-produced by Artie Ripp) and \\"Leader of the Pack\\" by The Shangri-Las. In 1964 alone, the duo were responsible for writing 17 singles that reached the Billboard Hot 100 chart. One of these was \\"Do Wah Diddy Diddy\\", originally recorded by the girl group The Exciters, but reworked for a No. 1 pop hit by the British Invasion group Manfred Mann. In 1964, Barry and Greenwich also penned songs for Connie Francis and charted with two Lesley Gore hits, \\"Maybe I Know\\" and \\"Look of Love.\\" Barry and Greenwich released solo singles under their own names for Red Bird in 1965, Greenwich the haunting \\"You Don't Know\\" and Barry the uptempo \\"I'll Still Love You\\". However, 1965 was difficult for the pair, since unbeknownst to many, Barry and Greenwich's marriage had begun to unravel. The couple divorced in late 1965 but would continue to work together for much of the following year, and sporadically after that until the late 1960s. Their professional and personal partnerships were the subject of the 1985 Broadway jukebox musical Leader of the Pack. In early 1966 Barry and Greenwich discovered a talented young singer-songwriter named Neil Diamond and brought him to the attention of Bert Berns, one of the principals of Bang Records. Diamond was signed to the label, and Barry and Greenwich produced Neil's first hits, including \\"Solitary Man\\", \\"Cherry, Cherry\\", \\"Kentucky Woman\\", and \\"Girl You'll Be A Woman Soon\\". Barry and Greenwich can be heard singing backgrounds on many of Diamond's Bang recordings. During the same period, the pair teamed with Phil Spector to write the classics \\"River Deep, Mountain High\\", by Ike and Tina Turner and \\"I Can Hear Music\\" by The Ronettes and The Beach Boys. Penning songs (especially love songs) together was awkward at best given the circumstances, and Barry and Greenwich's writing partnership soon came to its end. Among Barry's new collaborators were Marty Sanders, a member of the pop group Jay and the Americans, and Bang label CEO Bert Berns, with whom he wrote \\"Am I Groovin' You?\\", a top R & B single for Freddie Scott in 1967. Also in 1967, Reparata and the Delrons had a minor hit with Barry's \\"I'm Nobody's Baby Now\\". In late 1966, Barry was asked to produce tracks for the Monkees, a music group put together specifically as the stars of an NBC sitcom, also called \\"The Monkees\\". Drafted by the show's musical supervisor, Don Kirshner, Barry brought with him a few Neil Diamond-penned tunes for the group to record. One among them, \\"I'm a Believer\\", under Barry's production, would sail up the U.S. charts to No. 1 and become one of the biggest-selling records of all time. The group also had a hit with another Diamond-composed, Barry-produced single, \\"A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You\\". After Kirshner's dismissal from Colgems Records, however, Barry would not produce songs for the Monkees again until 1970's Changes, which contained many songs co-written by Barry, and their 1971 single Do It in the Name of Love, which he also co-wrote. Having been removed from the Monkees project, Kirshner became music supervisor for a new Saturday morning cartoon, The Archie Show, in 1968, and enlisted Barry as producer and main songwriter. During the next three years, Barry composed dozens of songs for the fictional Archies group, including the show's theme, \\"Everything's Archie\\", and the \\"Dances of the Week\\" (a staple of the show's first season). Barry had also recently founded his own label, Steed Records, and one of his most successful recording artists was Montreal native Andy Kim, who had hits with remakes of Barry's Ronettes tunes \\"Be My Baby\\" and \\"Baby, I Love You.\\" Barry and Kim collaborated on several tunes for The Archies to record, including their best-known single, \\"Sugar, Sugar\\", which hit No. 1, became the RIAA Record of the Year for 1969, and earned the group a gold record. In 1970, Barry wrote and produced singles and albums for Archies lead singer Ron Dante; Bobby Bloom (\\"Montego Bay\\"), and Robin McNamara (\\"Lay a Little Lovin' on Me\\"), among others. In addition, Barry penned his first music for motion pictures (Hello Down There (1969) and Where It's At) and wrote the music for and produced Tom Eyen's hit off-Broadway revue The Dirtiest Show in Town. In 1975 he produced \\"Ooh, I'm Satisfied\\" for short-lived mid-'70s pop singer-turned- session vocalist Polly Cutter. Production and film work In 1971 Barry moved from New York to California, where he had a production and administration deal with A&M; Records for several years. Between 1972 and 1975, he produced hit singles for Nino Tempo and April Stevens (together and separately) and the a cappella vocal group the Persuasions. In subsequent years he shifted his focus to television (writing the theme songs for One Day at a Time, The Jeffersons, and Family Ties) and movies (the score for 1980's The Idolmaker), although he continued his work in the pop music field. \\"I Honestly Love You\\", written by Barry with Peter Allen, became a 1974 No. 1 for Olivia Newton-John; and, in 1984, Jeffrey Osborne and Joyce Kennedy hit the Top 40 with another Barry composition, \\"The Last Time I Made Love\\", written with Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil. During the 1970s and 1980s Barry also scored numerous hit songs on the country charts, among them \\"Out Of Hand\\" by Gary Stewart, \\"Sayin' Hello, Sayin' I Love You, Sayin' Goodbye\\" by Jim Ed Brown and Helen Cornelius, \\"Lie To You For Your Love\\" by The Bellamy Brothers, a remake of \\"Chip Chip\\" (originally a 1962 Gene McDaniels pop smash) by Patsy Sledd, and \\"Walkin' In The Sun\\" by Glen Campbell. In 1990, Barry co-produced the theme song for the television series based on Where's Waldo?. In May 1991, Barry and Greenwich were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2004, Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest rock songs included six Greenwich- Barry compositions, more than by any other non-performing songwriting team. During the mid-1990s, Barry served as president of the National Academy of Songwriters, and in December 1998 he was a recipient of their Lifetime Achievement Award. In March 2000, Barry filmed a music special for the PBS television network, Chapel of Love: Jeff Barry and Friends. The show featured performances of Barry tunes by several of the artists who made them famous, including the Dixie Cups, the Crystals, Ronnie Spector, Andy Kim, Ray Peterson, and Ron Dante of the Archies. In recent years, Barry has been involved in several projects, among them the stage musical \\"The Girl Who Would Be King\\", written by the husband-and-wife team of Prudence Fraser and Robert Sternin, best known for their writing and production work on the CBS series The Nanny. The musical had its official world premiere in Vero Beach, Florida. In 2016, Barry composed songs for the musical theater show \\"Jambalaya The Musical\\" along with his production partner, Clarence Jey, a US Billboard and viral record producer. Jeff Barry was involved in part of the music in the Hallmark Channel movie titled \\"My Christmas Love\\". 2019 saw Jeff Barry and his writing partner Clarence Jey compose and write songs for Lego City Adventures, a computer-animated television series, produced by The Lego Group, for Nickelodeon television. Awards and honors Barry and Greenwich were among the 2010 recipients of the Ahmet Erteg√ºn Award from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Unable to attend the ceremony, Steven Van Zandt accepted the award on Barry's behalf.

History The 509th was ordered formed on 9 September 1943, taking most of its personnel from Panzer-Regiment 204 of the disbanded 22nd Panzer Division. The battalion received forty-five Tiger Is. It was committed to action in Ukraine as a part of Army Group South. Reaching the Front in October 1943, the 509th saw action near Kirovograd and Krivoi Rog, and participated in Wehrmacht's retreat. In early 1944, the 509th was involved in the Second Battle of Kiev and then retreated across Ukraine. In late May, the depleted 509th was pulled back for refitting. After receiving a full complement of Tiger 1s, the battalion was sent back to the front on 1 June 1944. On 22 June 1944, the Red Army launched Operation Bagration, and the 509th, attached to Army Group Centre, was in their line of advance. On 8 September 1944, the detachment lost sixteen Tigers in under 24 hours near Kielce, Poland. In late September the battalion was pulled back to be equipped with Tiger IIs. After it had received forty-five new Tiger IIs in December 1944, the detachment was attached to IV SS Panzer Corps, which was preparing an attempt to relieve the encircled garrison of Budapest. Launched on 18 January 1945, the operation, codenamed Konrad III, was ultimately a failure. During the operation, the 509th had lost forty of its forty-five Tiger IIs, with ten being total losses. The 509th was transferred to III Corps, to support Operation Fr√ºhlingserwachen in March, and retreating to Vienna. It took part in the Battle of Vienna in April, before retreating to the American lines. On 9 May 1945, the 509th surrendered to the U.S. Army near Linz.

Career The majority of Drexciya's releases were in the style of dancefloor-oriented electro, punctuated with elements of retro, 1980s Detroit techno, with occasional excursions into the ambient and industrial genres. Tracks were mostly centered around the Roland TR-808 drum machine. Drexciya, which eschewed media attention and its attendant focus on personality, developed a nautical afrofuturist myth. The group revealed in the sleeve notes to their 1997 album The Quest that \\"Drexciya\\" was an underwater country populated by the unborn children of pregnant African women who were thrown off of slave ships; the babies had adapted to breathe underwater in their mothers' wombs. The myth was built partly on Paul Gilroy's The Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Consciousness (1993), according to Kodwo Eshun. In 1997, Drexciya released a compilation album, titled The Quest. The duo released three studio albums: Neptune's Lair (1999), Harnessed the Storm (2002), and Grava 4 (2002). Stinson died suddenly on 3 September 2002 of a heart condition.

Located about southwest of downtown Chengdu to the north of Shuangliu District, Shuangliu airport is an important aviation hub for Western China. Shuangliu Airport is one of the two core hubs for Air China, together with Beijing, as well as the main hub and headquarters for Sichuan Airlines and Chengdu Airlines. China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, Lucky Air and Tibet Airlines also have bases at Shuangliu Airport. Shuangliu Airport handled 55.9 million passengers in 2019, being among world's 25 busiest airports in 2019, the fourth-busiest in mainland China, and the busiest in western China. Overview=History= The airport, formerly named Shuangguisi Airport, opened as an auxiliary military airfield in 1938 during the Second Sino- Japanese War/World War II. At the time, its runway was only large enough for small biplanes. It was also where the Republic of China Air Force Polikarpov I-15 fighters of the 5th Pursuit Group were based for aerial defense of the Chengtu area against Imperial Japanese bomber raids; this following the Chinese retreat from Wuhan to Chungking (now Chongqing) as the new provisional capital in aftermath of the Battle of Wuhan against the Imperial Japanese onslaught. Civilian targets were indiscriminately bombed, and ace fighter pilot of the Chinese Air Force Major Wong Sun-shui, Captain Cen Ze-liu and Lieutenant Lin Heng (younger brother of renowned architect and poet Lin Huiyin) flying in their I-15 fighter planes were all killed over Shuangliu air base as a result of battling against the most advanced fighter aircraft of the time; the Mitsubishi A6M \\"Zero\\" (Reisen) fighter, in defense of Chengdu on 14 March 1941.https://air.mnd.gov.tw/EN/PastCurrent/PastCurrent_Detail.aspx?FID=28&CID;=175&ID;=1278https://ww2db.com/person_bio.php?person_id=947https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/japans- world-war-ii-zero-fighter-terrified-allies-56647 During World War II, the airport was known as Shwangliu (Shuangliu) Airfield and was later used by the United States Army Air Forces Fourteenth Air Force as part of the China Defensive Campaign (1942‚Äì1945). It was used as a fighter base by the 33d Fighter Group, which flew P-47 Thunderbolt fighter-bombers from the airport in 1944 to support Chinese ground forces, and also by reconnaissance units that operated camera-equipped P-38 Lightnings that located Japanese forces and provided intelligence to the fighter-bombers. The Americans closed their facilities at Shwangliu Airfield at the end of August 1945.Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units Of World War II. Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. On December 12, 1956, the Shuangguisi Airport was put under civil aviation, which was then formally listed as a civil aviation airport and renamed Chengdu Shuangliu Airport. In 1957, the flights of Chengdu civil aviation were shifted to Shuangliu Airport from Guanghan Airport. The flight courses from Chengdu were thus opened to various cities within China including Beijing, Taiyuan, Xi'an, Chongqing, Kunming, Guiyang, and Nanchong. The airport went through several earlier expansions in 1959, 1967, 1983 and 1991 respectively. =Current status= A large-scale expansion was conducted on flight area and navigation area from 1994 to 2001. The runway was extended to with Class 4E rating, allowing for larger jumbo jets including the Boeing 747-400. The newly built terminal building was incorporated with a three- parallel-porch design, accommodating an hourly capacity of 3,500 passengers during rush hours, while the previous terminal building was only designated for regional flights within Sichuan and Chongqing. The airport is now an international civil airport with flights to more than 50 international destinations and over 170 domestic airports, and is a hub for Chengdu Airlines, Air China and Sichuan Airlines. It is linked to downtown Chengdu by the Airport Expressway, the Chengdu‚ÄìMianyang‚ÄìLeshan intercity railway and the newly built Chengdu Metro line 10 which has stations in both terminals. KLM launched the first intercontinental air route from Chengdu, to Amsterdam, on 28 May 2006. The construction of its second runway started from late 2008, and service commenced in December 2009. The completed new runway, in length and in width, upgraded the previous flight area rating from 4E to 4F, capable of handling the Airbus A380. The new Terminal 2 has started construction in June 2009; trial operations began on July 28, 2012 with limited airlines and was officially opened on August 9, 2012 for all domestic airlines other than Sichuan Airlines. T1 is split into Domestic and International wings, and retained all international flights from airlines within and outside China. The new terminal is twice the size of the current T1, and allows the airport to handle up to 50 million passengers annually. On June 9, 2014, United Airlines began operating a nonstop service from San Francisco to Chengdu, connecting central China to the United States non-stop for the first time.\\"For United And The Boeing 787, Chengdu Is Just the Start In China.\\" Forbes. September 4, 2013. Retrieved on February 27, 2014. Service to the US has since expanded, as Hainan Airlines now offers nonstop service from Chengdu to Los Angeles and began nonstop service to New York‚ÄìJFK in October 2017. In addition, Sichuan Airlines and Air China have many international routes in this airport.

It is located 6 kilometres south west of the Sydney central business district and is part of the local government area of the City of Sydney. Erskineville is a diverse suburb homing to a wide variety of ethnicity from its varying Southeast Europe and Aboriginal community. Erskineville is colloquially known as Erko. Erskineville is bordered by the suburbs of Newtown to the west, Redfern to the north, St Peters to the south, and Alexandria to the east. The locality of Macdonaldtown sits over the north-west border. Erskineville is a residential suburb. Erskineville Oval is located on the eastern border of the suburb. History Erskineville Boot Making School, 1909 The suburb was originally called after an earlier subdivision in 1846 in the south of Erskineville owned by Stephen Macdonald. The streets around the early Macdonaldtown subdivision are named after relations of the Macdonald family - Amy, Flora, Eve, Coulson and Rochford. Knight Street is named for Henry Knight, one of the earliest brickmakers in the district and the first mayor of Macdonaldtown. Devine Street is named for the first grant holder, Nicholas Devine, the first principal superintendent of convicts. He called his property Burren Farm, after a region of County Clare in his native Ireland. Erskineville is named after Erskine Villa, the home of Wesleyan minister, Reverend George Erskine, built in 1830. After changing owners a few times, the property was eventually left to the Church of England and became the rectory for the Holy Trinity Church at Macdonaldtown (it was demolished in 1961 after serving as the rectory for eighty years). The area was first incorporated on 23 May 1872, with the name of the \\"Municipal District of Macdonald Town\\" (but was variously known as the \\"Borough of Macdonald Town\\" or the \\"Municipality of Macdonaldtown\\"). On 19 July 1872, the first council, consisting of six aldermen in one electorate, was elected (Charles Brandling Henderson, Henry Knight, James Bryan, Alexander Swanson, William Irwin and James Heighington), with Henry Knight elected as the first mayor at the first meeting on 23 July 1872. In 1893 Macdonaldtown was renamed as Erskineville, when the Parliament of New South Wales passed the \\"Borough of Erskineville Naming Act, 1893\\", effecting the municipal name change.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollen, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 102 In the late nineteenth century, the inhabitants were originally market gardeners, though brick making and tanning also became dominant industries. The Victorian cottages and small rows of Victorian terraces that dominate the built form of the suburb were the homes of the workers in these industries, which explains their smallness: a four-metre wide terrace is large by Erskineville standards. In the early twentieth century, manufacturing in the area diversified, and Erskineville became a resolutely working class inner city suburb. In 1938 the Erskineville Public Housing Scheme was inaugurated on the western end of Erskineville Park, as an early response by the NSW Government to the Housing Improvement Act 1937 towards the problem of slum clearance in the inner city. From the 1970s, Erskineville underwent gentrification with new residents attracted to the village atmosphere, public transport links and the proximity to the CBD. Sydney Park Road From the 19th century until the second half of the 20th century, the south-eastern section of Erskineville was taken up by large industrial uses. Bakewell Brothers brick and pottery works operated until 1956, and Metters Limited had a large factory that made items such as the \\"Kooka\\" stove operating from 1907 to 1974. Steelworks like McPherson‚Äôs Pty Ltd and Hadfields Steel Works also operated until the 1970s. The site of these industrial works were identified since 1998 as a site for urban renewal, with the land east of the rail line, south of Ashmore Street and north of Coulson Street known as the \\"Ashmore Estate\\". The Ashmore Estate is currently identified for major residential redevelopment as part of the urban renewal process. Transport=Trams= thumb A C3765 train at Erskineville Station. The Erskineville line opened as an electric double track tramway in 1909. It branched from tracks at Regent Street in Chippendale, and passed west along Meagher Street, then south into Abercombie Street. It followed Abercrombie Street south across the junction with Cleveland Street through Golden Grove, before swinging south into Golden Grove Street then right into Wilson Street. The line then passed under the railway lines at Burren Street, adjacent to the entrance to Macdonaldtown railway station. The line then became a single track loop passing up Burren Street to Erskineville Road, then west along Erskineville Road to Septimus Street, then Albert Street before rejoining the tracks at Burren Street. Services operated from Circular Quay using the Pitt and Castlereagh Street lines. The line south of [Cleveland Street closed in 1940, with the northern section used by other services until its closure in 1958. The Henderson Road line was a short line that branched from the Alexandria line tracks at the corner of Henderson and Mitchell Roads in Alexandria and passed along Henderson Road to Park Street in Erskineville, and later to Bridge Street adjacent to Erskineville railway station. Services operated from Circular Quay with the line opening to Park Street in 1906 and to Bridge Street in 1909. The line was an electrified single track throughout. The line was an early closure in 1933 and was replaced by a private bus service that no longer operates. =Trains and buses= Heavy rail was extended south from Central railway station to Erskineville between 1884 and 1893 via the Illawarra railway line. Today, Erskineville is served by the T3 Bankstown Line of the Sydney Trains network. Newtown railway station, Macdonaldtown railway station and St Peters railway station also service the suburb and are within close distance from the centre of Erskineville. Buses provide a service from Marrickville Metro shopping centre at Marrickville to Surry Hills.

The legal status of Australian nationality or Australian citizenship was created by the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948. (in 1973 renamed the Australian Citizenship Act 1948), which came into force on 26 January 1949. Australian nationality and citizenship existed prior to this date but were not legal concepts: Australian nationality or citizenship meant identification with the Australian community and participation in its politics. The 1948 Act was amended many times, notably in 1973, 1984, 1986 and 2002. It was replaced by the Australian Citizenship Act 2007,. which commenced on 1 July 2007. On 13 December 1973, Australia acceded to the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness and to the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. Australian citizenship law is administered by the Department of Home Affairs which can issue certificates of citizenship on naturalisation or on request provide other proof or evidence of Australian citizenship. Australian passports are issued to Australian citizens by the Australian Passport Office of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. In Australia, the terms \\"nationality\\" and \\"citizenship\\" can be used interchangeably, but the term \\"citizenship\\" (or \\"citizen\\") is more commonly used, while \\"nationality\\" is most often used in official documents and forms. In general, a person may acquire citizenship automatically (\\"by operation of law\\") through birth in Australia or through Australian descent, or by application after a period of residence in Australia. The process of acquiring citizenship by application is referred to as \\"naturalisation\\". History of Australian citizenship Until the passing in Australia of the Nationality Act 1920,. Australia's nationality law, like that of other Commonwealth countries, was governed by the English common law concept of a British subject. (See also British nationality law.) The idea that there was such a thing as an Australian legal nationality, as distinct from a British one, was considered by the High Court of Australia in 1906 to be a \\"novel idea\\" to which it was \\"not disposed to give any countenance\\".. That was as a matter of law, but in 1913 and 1930 Australian journalists considered that there were such things as Australian nationality and citizenship. The British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act 1914, an act of the Westminster parliament, codified the common law rules. Australia followed this with the enacting of the Nationality Act 1920, which came into effect on 1 January 1921 and codified the concept of a British subject in Australia. In general, the principles of the 1920 Act and subsequent amendments followed United Kingdom legislation, although there were some differences that could lead to a person being a British subject solely under Australian law. The 1948 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting decided to make major changes in nationality laws throughout the Commonwealth, following Canada's decision to enact its Canadian citizenship law, effective from 1 January 1947. Until then, all Commonwealth countries, with the exception of the Irish Free State, had a single nationality status of British subject. It was decided at that conference that the United Kingdom and the self-governing dominions would each adopt a separate national citizenship, while retaining the common status of British subject. The Australian Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948, which came into effect on 26 January 1949, gave effect to that arrangement and created the concept of Australian nationality, while those holding it continued to be British subjects. However, the status of other (non-Australian) British subjects in Australia differed from the status of those who were not British subjects. Aborigines became Australian citizens under the 1948 Act in the same way as other Australians (although Aborigines were not counted in the Australian population until after a 1967 referendum). The same applied to Torres Strait Islanders and the indigenous population of the Territory of Papua (then a part of Australia). The relationship between Australian citizenship and the shared citizenship of the British Empire or Commonwealth continued to evolve. In 1986, the Australia Act 1986 severed almost all of the last remaining constitutional links between the United Kingdom and Australia. Subsequently, in 1988, for the first time, the High Court ruled that anyone who was not an Australian citizen, whether or not a subject of the Monarch of the United Kingdom, was an alien.. The 1948 Act was amended many times, notably in 1958, 1973, 1984, 1986 and 2002. In 1973 the 1948 Act was renamed the Australian Citizenship Act 1948. On 15 March 2007, the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 received Royal Assent and replaced the 1948 Act, commencing on 1 July 2007. Nationality law changes The principal milestones in the development of Australian nationality law have been: * 1920: The Nationality Act 1920 codified the concept of a British subject, as defined under Australian law, effective 1 January 1921. * 1948: The Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948 created the concept of Australian citizenship, and came into force on 26 January 1949. Australian citizens continued to also be British subjects. * 1958: On 8 October 1958, provisions which caused some naturalised Australians resident outside Australia and New Guinea for 7 years to lose Australian citizenship (section 20 of the 1948 Act) were repealed. * 1973: Significant changes to the law implemented by the Whitlam Labor government, mostly effective on 1 December 1973. ** Distinction between migrants from Commonwealth and other countries (in terms of ability to become Australian citizens) abolished. The previous residence requirements of 1 year (Commonwealth) and 5 years (non-Commonwealth) to become Australian citizens replaced by a common residence period of 3 years, but with a six-month transition period. ** Age of majority for citizenship purposes reduced from 21 to 18. ** The 1948 Act was renamed the Australian Citizenship Act 1948. * 1975: The Papua New Guinea (Australian Citizenship) Regulations 1975 provided that any Australian citizen becoming a citizen of Papua New Guinea at Independence on 16 September 1975 should lose Australian citizenship. * 1984: The Australian Citizenship (Amendment) Act 1984 became effective on 22 November 1984 and made significant changes, including that Australian law would no longer regard Australians as \\"British subjects\\". British subjects in Australia who were not Australian citizens became permanent residents. (the brackets have been removed) These former British subjects retained the vote, but Australian passports were only to be issued to Australian citizens. At the same time, the residence period for naturalisation was reduced from 3 to 2 years. * 1986: The Australian Citizenship (Amendment) Act 1986 provided that children born in Australia on or after 20 August 1986 would only be Australian citizens if at least one parent is an Australian citizen or permanent resident. * 1994: From 31 January 1994, new citizens have been required to take a pledge of commitment to Australia, instead of an oath to the Queen of Australia. * 2002: From 4 April 2002, Australians becoming citizens of other countries by a voluntary act no longer lose Australian citizenship. * 2007: On 1 July 2007, the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 replaced the 1948 Act. Many Australians who had lost citizenship under the 1948 Act, and their children, are given access to Australian citizenship. The residence period for naturalisation was increased from 2 to 4 years, General residence requirement. with a 3-year transition period for existing permanent residents, and a citizenship test was introduced. Rights and duties=Rights= Australian citizens enjoy the following rights (subject to certain exceptions): * entitlement to an Australian passport and to Australian consulate assistance overseas * entitlement to re-enter Australia at any time without any immigration restrictions * immunity from deportation * entitlement to register overseas-born children as Australian citizens by descent (subject to some additional criteria) * entitlement to seek employment by the Federal (Commonwealth) Government, or in the Australian Defence Force (where citizenship is normally required) * entitlement to vote, with age and sometimes other conditions * entitlement to stand for public office (but dual citizens cannot stand for the Federal Parliament unless they have taken all reasonable steps to renounce their foreign citizenship, although they are allowed to stand for State parliaments) *the right to permanently reside in Australia, i.e. to live and work in Australia (\\"right of abode\\"), and entitlements to public services such as subsidised education, health services and social security. =Duties= The following duties are expected of Australian citizens: * obey the law * pay tax * defend Australia should the need arise * enroll to vote if above 18 years of age, and vote at all elections and referenda (unless there is a reasonable excuse such as a religious objection, being overseas or illness on polling day) * serve on a jury, if called upon (unless there is a valid reason or exemption) Acquisition of Australian citizenship on 26 January 1949 A distinct Australian nationality or citizenship was created on 26 January 1949. Persons who were British subjects on that date would continue to have that status but could in addition apply to acquire the new Australian citizenship if they were: * born or naturalised in Australia (in general, birth in Australia automatically conferred British subject status) * born in New Guinea * born overseas to an Australian father provided they had entered Australia with permanent entry permits on or before 26 January 1949 * ordinarily resident in Australia for the 5 years preceding 26 January 1949 * women who were married to Australian men and had entered Australia with permanent entry permits before 26 January 1949. A person could now acquire Australian citizenship even if they also held or obtained the nationality of another Commonwealth country, or if they also held foreign citizenship. =Status of British subjects = The term British subject had a particular meaning in Australian nationality law. The term encompassed all citizens of countries included in the list contained in the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948. The list of countries was based on, but was not identical with, those countries (and their colonies) which were members of the Commonwealth. The list was amended from time to time as various former colonies became independent countries, but the list in the Act was not necessarily up-to-date as far as to constitute exactly a list of countries in the Commonwealth at any given time. This definition of \\"British subject\\" meant that, for the purposes of Australian nationality law, citizens of countries which had become republics, such as India, were classified as \\"British subjects\\". The Australian Citizenship (Amendment) Act 1984 removed the status of \\"British subject\\" from Australian citizenship law, with effect from 22 November 1984,S 33 of the (brackets now removed) repealed s 51 of the 1948 Act. and British subjects who had not acquired Australian citizenship came to be treated as non-citizen permanent residents. They were not entitled to an Australian passport, although existing passports held by non-citizens continued to be valid until each expired. They continued, and still continue, to have voting rights if they were on the electoral roll immediately before 26 January 1984.Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, s 93(1)(b)(ii). The status of British subject ceased to apply to a person otherwise entitled but who acquires citizenship of Australia or another Commonwealth country. Citizenship by birth A person born in Australia before 25 January 1949 was automatically a British subject, based on the jus soli principle, regardless of the status of their parents: children born to visitors or foreigners also acquired citizenship by birth. (The only exception was children of foreign ambassadors, who were immune from local jurisdiction and local duties of allegiance; the children's nationality would be determined by the foreign country's law.) Such persons need to apply for Australian citizenship, otherwise since 20 August 1986 they have the status of permanent resident. A person born in Australia between 26 January 1949 and 19 August 1986, automatically acquired Australian citizenship.Section 10 of 1948 Act. Until 21 November 1984, such a person had the status of Australian citizen and British subject, but after that date the status of \\"British subject\\" ceased to exist in Australia. The jus soli principle was abolished from 20 August 1986, with persons born after that date acquiring Australian citizenship by birth only if a descendant of at least one parent who was an Australian citizen or permanent resident at the time of birth. The definition of parenthood was tested in H v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (2010), where it was held that parenthood does not necessarily require it to be of a biological nature.. A child born in Australia (and who is not otherwise an Australian citizen) and who lives in Australia automatically acquires Australian citizenship on his or her 10th birthday, if the child has not been granted or otherwise acquired Australian citizenship in the meantime. This occurs automatically (by operation of law), and applies irrespective of the immigration status of the child or his/her parents. Citizenship by birth. Children born in Australia whose parents are stateless and not entitled to any other country's citizenship may in some circumstances apply for and be granted Australian citizenship. 'Baby Ferouz' was born to Rohingya Muslim parents who had fled from Myanmar which did not recognise them as citizens. His parents and siblings were being held at the Nauru Detention Centre, however the family was flown to Brisbane due to complications in pregnancy, with the result that while baby Ferouz was born in Australia, he was deemed to be an unauthorised maritime arrival and could not be given a protection visa. In December 2014, he and his family were given a temporary protection visa which allowed them to be released from immigration detention. Citizenship by descent A person born outside Australia to an Australian citizen parent can acquire Australian citizenship in the following ways: * British subjects born outside Australia before 26 January 1949 with an Australian father became Australian citizens automatically upon entering Australia with a permanent visa (up to 30 April 1987). * A person born outside Australia or New Guinea before 26 January 1949 may be registered as an Australian citizen provided - ** that person has a parent born or naturalised in Australia or New Guinea, and ** the parent became an Australian citizen on 26 January 1949. * A person born outside Australia on or after 26 January 1949 may be registered as an Australian citizen by descent provided - ** they had an Australian citizen parent at the time of birth and ** If the Australian parent acquired Australian citizenship by descent, that parent must have been lawfully present in Australia for a period or periods totalling at least 2 years at some time in their life. Australian citizenship by descent is not conferred at birth, and a child born outside Australia to an Australian parent must apply for citizenship. If aged 18 or over, an applicant for Australian citizenship by descent must be of good character. =Children of former Australian citizens= Where an Australian parent has lost Australian citizenship before the birth of a child, the child is not eligible for Australian citizenship by descent. However, such a child is eligible for a special conferral of Australian citizenship (naturalisation) under section 21(6) of the 2007 Act if the Australian citizen parent lost Australian citizenship under section 17 of the 1948 Act prior to the child's birth. Section 17 concerned automatic loss of Australian citizenship upon naturalisation in another country as an adult before 4 April 2002. Children of former Australian citizens who lost their Australian citizenship under section 18 (renunciation), section 20 (loss by naturalised citizens who left Australia before 1951) or section 23 (automatic loss as a minor) do not benefit from this concession. There is no age limit and those over 18 are eligible to apply. Citizenship by conferral (formerly known as naturalisation) Cooktown, Queensland. 2012 Calamvale, Queensland. 2017. \\"Naturalisation is the process by which one undertakes allegiance to a new sovereign and, often enough, sheds allegiance to another sovereign.\\". Between 26 January 1949 and 30 November 1973, British subjects were able to apply for registration as an Australian citizen after one year's residence in Australia as an immigrant, and there was no requirement to attend a citizenship ceremony. Non-British subjects were required to apply for naturalization, which had stricter requirements, including a five-year residency. They were required to attend a citizenship ceremony and swear an oath of allegiance to the Crown. From 1966 they were also obliged to renounce \\"all other allegiance\\". The Australian Citizenship Act 1973 ended the preferential treatment for British subjects from 1 December 1973. From that date, the same criteria for naturalisation applied to all applicants for citizenship by naturalisation, though the special status of British subject was retained. Also from that date the age of majority for citizenship matters was reduced to eighteen years, so that they could apply for citizenship in their own right. The common residence requirement of three years was reduced to two years from 22 November 1984. The status of British subject was removed from Australian citizenship law, with effect on 1 May 1987.Australian Citizenship Amendment Act 1984 removed Part II of the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948, effective 1 May 1987. (That status had been discontinued in British law on 1 January 1983.) People who became permanent residents from 1 July 2007 must have been lawfully resident in Australia for four years before applying for citizenship by conferral. The \\"lawfully resident\\" test could be satisfied by any period of lawful stay in Australia including a stay on a temporary or bridging visa, but the applicant must: * have been in Australia for 12 months as a permanent resident, * have had absences from Australia of no more than twelve months (total) in the previous four years, including no more than three months (total) in the 12 months before applying, * have not been in Australia at any time without a valid visa in the four years preceding application, * understand the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizenship (except for applicants aged 60 or over), * be able to speak and understand basic English (except for applicants aged 60 or over), * understand the nature of the application, and * intend to reside in Australia or to maintain a close and continuing association with Australia. Children aged under 18 can be included in the application of a responsible parent. The standard residence requirements do not apply to such children. There are some exceptions to the standard requirements, including: * children of former Australian citizens, * Australian Defence Force veterans, * former Australian citizens and those born in Australia, * children adopted by Australian citizens, * spouses and interdependent partners of Australian citizens, * persons born in Papua before Independence in 1975, or * persons born in Australia who are stateless. Those who were present in Australia as permanent residents before 1 July 2007 remain subject to the previous residence requirement (in force since 1984, e.g. resident for 2 years) on any application for conferral made before 1 July 2010 ‚Äì they must: * have been present in Australia as a permanent resident for a total of two years in the five years before application, * have been present in Australia for a total of 12 months in the two years before application. In general, applicants aged 16 or over must attend a citizenship ceremony and make a pledge of commitment, except for: * children of former Australian citizens granted citizenship under section 21(6) of the Act, * persons born in Papua before independence granted citizenship under section 21(7) of the Act, * stateless persons born in Australia and granted citizenship under section 21(8) of the Act, or * persons with a permanent or enduring physical or mental incapacity that means the person is not capable of understanding the nature of the application, or demonstrating a basic knowledge of English, or demonstrating an adequate knowledge of the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizenship. From 1 October 2007, most applicants for Australian citizenship by conferral aged between 18 and 60 must pass the Australian citizenship test, which focuses on Australia's values, history, and traditional and national symbols. Loss of Australian citizenship Prior to 4 April 2002, many Australian citizens lost Australian citizenship through acquiring another citizenship, or being the child of a parent who did so. From that date, the scope to lose Australian citizenship is more limited. In any case the person must have another citizenship to revert to, to avoid creating a stateless person. = Adult Australian citizens acquiring another citizenship = Between 26 January 1949 and 3 April 2002, an adult Australian generally lost Australian citizenship automatically upon acquisition of another citizenship by a 'voluntary and formal act',Australian section 17 of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 Act 1948, section 17. with the following rules: * the age of majority in this respect was 21 until 30 November 1973, and 18 thereafter, * before 22 November 1984, Australian citizenship was not lost if the acquisition of another citizenship took place while the person was inside Australia, * from 22 November 1984, the incidental acquisition of another citizenship as the result of another activity (such as an application for a foreign passport, or foreign residence) did not cause loss of Australian citizenship, * loss of Australian citizenship still occurred even if no oath of allegiance was taken to the other country, * loss of Australian citizenship occurred even if the Queen was also Head of State of the other country (i.e. a Commonwealth realm such as Canada, New Zealand or the United Kingdom), * it was not relevant whether the acquisition of another citizenship was reported to the Australian authorities. Section 17 of the 1948 Citizenship Act was repealed with effect from 4 April 2002.. Although the repeal was not retroactive, since 1 July 2007 former Australian citizens who lost citizenship because of the section are generally able to apply for resumption of Australian citizenship. = Loss of citizenship of children = Children did not lose Australian citizenship by virtue of their own actions, but could lose Australian citizenship if a parent lost Australian citizenship: * if the child did not have any other citizenship, it did not lose Australian citizenship. * before 22 November 1984 there was only one 'parent' for citizenship purposes, usually the father. Loss of Australian citizenship by the other parent did not affect the child's status. * from 22 November 1984 loss of Australian citizenship by either parent could affect the child's citizenship. However, a child would not lose Australian citizenship in this circumstance if one parent remained an Australian citizen (or was an Australian citizen at death). Loss of Australian citizenship occurred under section 23 of the 1948 Act. Even after the repeal of section 17 of the Act in 2002, section 23 was left in place. It remains possible for an Australian child to lose Australian citizenship this way. However, since the repeal of section 17, this is much less common and in general only applies where a parent is deprived of Australian citizenship, or renounces Australian citizenship under section 18 of the Act. Under the Australian Citizenship Act 2007, in force from 1 July 2007, an Australian child no longer automatically loses Australian citizenship based on a parent's actions. However, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has the right to deprive a child of Australian citizenship in these circumstances on a discretionary basis. = Naturalised Australian citizens = Between 26 January 1956 and 7 October 1958, a naturalised Australian citizen lost Australian citizenship if resident outside Australia or New Guinea for a continuous period of 7 years without registering annually a declaration of intent to retain Australian citizenship. This occurred by virtue of section 20 of the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1948 which was repealed on 8 October 1958. The provision had the potential to create stateless persons. Since 1 July 2007, persons who lost Australian citizenship because of the provision may apply to resume Australian citizenship, subject only to being of good character. = Australian citizens connected with Burma = Burma became independent outside the Crown's dominions on 4 January 1948. In the Burma Independence Act 1948 the United Kingdom legislated to remove British subject status on that date from: * any person born in Burma whose father or paternal grandfather was born in Burma, and neither father nor paternal grandfather born in a British territory or British protectorate; and * women married to men who lost British subject status by virtue of the above provision. Such persons who were domiciled in the United Kingdom or \\"His Majesty's dependencies\\" were given two years to elect to remain British. Australian legislation was not updated at the time and hence the common law applied. British subjects connected with Burma lost British subject status under Australian law only if resident in Burma. As a result, some British subjects connected with Burma acquired Australian citizenship on 26 January 1949 if resident in Australia for 5 years at that point. On 29 July 1950, the Nationality and Citizenship (Burmese) Act 1950 removed the discrepancy between Australian and British law on the status of persons connected with Burma. As a result, Australian citizenship was lost on 29 July 1950 by persons who had had British nationality removed from them under the UK legislation in 1948, and persons descended from or married to such persons. Such persons had until 29 July 1952 (two years from the date of commencement of the Act) to register a declaration of intention to remain a British subject. If such a declaration was registered, the person was deemed never to have lost Australian citizenship. = Service in the armed forces of an enemy country = Section 19 of the 1948 Act stated: \\"An Australian citizen who, under the law of a foreign country, is a national or citizen of that country and serves in the armed forces of a country at war with Australia shall, upon commencing so to serve, cease to be an Australian citizen.\\" Despite being involved in a number of armed conflicts since 1949, Australia has not declared a formal state of war on another sovereign nation in that period, and hence section 19 has not operated up to now. It has been re-enacted as section 35 of the 2007 Act. = Deprivation of Australian citizenship = A Australian citizen may be deprived of Australian citizenship under section 34 of the 2007 Act in the following circumstances: * conviction for certain offences against the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 or the Migration Act 1958. These mainly involve fraud in the person's citizenship or migration application. * where the person receives a prison sentence of 12 months or more (in any country) for an offence committed before the person's application for Australian citizenship was approved. Deprivation of citizenship cannot occur for this reason if the person has no other citizenship. Any Australian citizen may also be deprived of Australian citizenship by virtue of the same section in these circumstances: * In December 2015, the 2007 Act was amended by the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Allegiance to Australia) Act 2015 (Cth) which introduced three mechanisms by which citizenship may be forfeited: renunciation by conduct (s 33A); An expanded s 35 to cover service in a declared terrorist organisation; and a new power for the Minister to cancel citizenship after a person is convicted of one of a range of offences, most of which are connected to terrorism or treason, and the Minister is satisfied of certain public interest criteria (s 35A).. :*The explanatory memorandum makes it clear that engaging in the specified 'terrorism' conduct is what shows that the person has acted inconsistently with their allegiance to Australia. The loss of citizenship is said to occur by operation of law. The idea that something can be surrendered by operation of law is well established in Australian case law ‚Äì see for example Bagnall v White. ‚Äì however the recent decision of the Full Federal Court in SZSSJ v Minister for Immigration and Border Protection has indicated that it may be difficult for courts to avoid a conclusion that an administrative decision must be made by someone at some point, and that a Minister must hold ultimate responsibility for his or her department's decisions..Peter Lochore, 'What does it take to repudiate one's allegiance to Australia?' (2016) 43(2) \\"Brief\\" 20-24 :* The first person to be deprived of Australian citizenship for terrorism offences was Islamic State fighter Khaled Sharrouf in February 2017 and he was thus left with his Lebanese citizenship. = Ex-citizen visa = An Australian citizen whose citizenship ceases while they are in the Australian migration zone is taken to have been immediately granted an ex-citizen visa; this is a permanent visa to remain in, but not re-enter, Australia: Migration Act 1958, s 35.Migration Act 1958, section 35Could people stripped of their Australian citizenship be immediately removed from Australia? They need not be told that they have lost Australian citizenship, nor that they now hold this visa. If they leave Australia and wish to re-enter, they will need a Resident Return Visa or other permanent visa. Since 2013, when the Australian mainland was excised from the migration zone, the migration zone has effectively ceased to exist, so that the automatic granting of the ex-citizen visa no longer applies. In any event, an ex-citizen visa may be cancelled on character grounds and the person then removed from Australia; this is likely where citizenship has ceased because it has been revoked under section 21 of the Act. Resumption of Australian citizenship Since 1 July 2007, a former Australian citizen can resume Australian citizenship if: * the former citizen lost Australian citizenship automatically under section 17, 20 or 23 of the 1948 Act, subject only to being of \\"good character\\". * the former citizen renounced Australian citizenship, subject to an additional requirement that the renunciation must have been to acquire or retain another nationality, or to avoid hardship or disadvantage. Children born to former Australian citizens (only those who lost Australian citizenship by virtue of section 17 of the Act) after loss of the parent's citizenship, and before the parent resumed citizenship, may be considered for a grant of Australian citizenship (whether aged under or over 18). There is no requirement for the parent to resume citizenship. This policy was put in place by Ministerial policy on 13 October 2003 for children under 18 and extended in the 2007 Act to those aged 18 or over. Some former Australian citizens may qualify for a Resident Return Visa to return to Australia as permanent residents. After 12 months as a permanent resident in Australia, it is normally possible for a former Australian citizen to apply for Australian citizenship. Citizenship by adoption Australian citizenship is acquired automatically on adoption in the following circumstances: * the adoption takes place in Australia on or after 22 November 1984, * the child is a permanent resident, and * at least one adoptive parent is an Australian citizen. In all other circumstances an application for grant of Australian citizenship must be made for the child. On 8 May 2005, the Minister for Citizenship announced a policy change to require all child applicants for grant of Australian citizenship by adoption to hold an adoption visa, or other permanent visa. However, it does not appear that there is any requirement for the child to be physically resident in Australia. The Australian Citizenship Act 2007 additionally allows for simplified registration of a person as an Australian citizen where that person was adopted overseas in accordance with the Hague Adoption Convention. Visa requirements Visa requirements for Australian citizens An Australian passport does not, in itself, entitle the holder to enter another country. To enter another country, the traveller must comply with the visa and entry requirements of the other countries to be visited, which vary from country to country and may apply specifically to a particular passport type, the traveller's nationality, criminal history or many other factors. According to the 2019 Henley Passport Index, Australian passport holders can visit 181 countries without a visa or by being issued a visa on arrival. Multiple citizenship With effect from 4 April 2002, there are no restrictions (under Australian law) on Australians holding the citizenship of other countries. Prior to 4 April 2002, it was still possible for Australians in some circumstances to hold dual citizenship, including: * those born in Australia who automatically acquired another citizenship at birth; * migrants naturalising in Australia, provided their former country did not revoke their citizenship; * children born overseas to Australian parents who automatically acquired the citizenship of their country of birth (e.g. the U.S. or Canada) as well as Australian citizenship by descent. Holding a foreign passport does not in itself cause loss of Australian citizenship. However, all Australian citizens are required to use an Australian passport when entering and leaving Australia. This provision is intended to prevent immigration-related delays while a traveller's status is confirmed, as an Australian citizen cannot be granted a visa to enter Australia. However, Australian citizens have never been prosecuted simply for travelling on the \\"wrong\\" passport, provided all other immigration requirements are satisfied. Australians with compelling reasons can apply for an Australian Declaratory Visa for their foreign passport, allowing them to use it for travel to and from Australia. Holding dual nationality continues to be a bar to being elected to the Australian Parliament.See examples in Section 44 of the Constitution of Australia#(i) Allegiance to a foreign power. In the 2017 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis, several members of Parliament were found to have been ineligible for election owing to their being dual citizens, and others are possibly ineligible. New Zealand citizens New Zealanders were included in the definition of British subject in the 1948 Act and hence many New Zealanders resident in Australia on 26 January 1949 became entitled to acquire Australian citizenship. There was no bar to New Zealanders acquiring Australian citizenship as well as New Zealand citizenship under the equivalent New Zealand legislation, British Nationality and New Zealand Citizenship Act 1948 (NZ). Persons classified as British subjects were entitled to the same rights as Australian citizens, but were not classified as permanent residents. New Zealanders could become Australian citizens by registration or naturalisation, without a requirement to achieve permanent resident status, until February 2001. Effective 22 November 1984, the status of \\"British subject\\" was removed from Australian citizenship law,Sect 33 of the (brackets now removed) repealed s 51 of the 1948 Act. and British subjects who had not acquired Australian citizenship were classified as \\"non-citizen permanent residents\\". New Zealand citizens arriving after February 2001 have been required to apply for and obtain Australian permanent resident status before becoming eligible for Australian citizenship. Children born in Australia before 27 February 2001 to New Zealand parents have generally been Australian citizens by birth. However, those born between 20 August 1986 and 31 August 1994 did not acquire Australian citizenship by birth, which is due to a technicality in the 1986 legislation which limited the acquisition of Australian citizenship to children of Australian citizens and permanent residents, which was not corrected until 1994. These restrictions do not apply to children of a person who was an Australian citizen or permanent resident at the time of birth. In addition, a child born in Australia to two parents who are New Zealand citizens by descent is entitled to Australian citizenship. This is because under New Zealand nationality law, New Zealand citizens by descent cannot pass on New Zealand citizenship by descent, therefore rendering the child otherwise stateless. Special rules apply to cases in which the New Zealand parent is a diplomat, official guest, a visiting member of the armed forces, or has entered Australia on the passport of another country. Children born in Australia to New Zealand parents automatically acquire Australian citizenship on their 10th birthday, if ordinarily resident in Australia until age 10, if they had not already acquired Australian citizenship by birth or naturalisation. Papua New Guinea Prior to 1975, what is now Papua New Guinea was divided into two legal entities under common Australian administration. The Territory of Papua was an external territory of Australia itself, while the Territory of New Guinea was never an Australian territory in a legal sense, but rather a Trust Territory under Australian administration. As a result, those born or naturalised in Territory of Papua acquired Australian citizenship on the same basis as any other part of Australia. However, those of indigenous descent were not automatically entitled to reside in the rest of Australia, despite holding Australian citizenship. It was possible in some circumstances for such persons to apply for and be granted a right of residence in mainland Australia. Persons connected with Territory of New Guinea were Australian protected persons rather than Australian citizens and for nationality purposes the territory was considered not to be part of Australia. Papua New Guinea became independent on 16 September 1975. Australian citizens connected with the Territory of Papua lost Australian citizenship on that date if they became citizens of Papua New Guinea (PNG). PNG citizenship was generally conferred only on those born in PNG who had at least two grandparents of indigenous descent, and: * in the case of Papua, had not acquired a right of permanent residence in mainland Australia or the citizenship of any other country; * in the case of New Guinea, had not acquired Australian or any other citizenship. Persons of non-indigenous descent who acquired Australian citizenship by connection with PNG before independence generally still retain it. = Australian citizenship by descent for persons born in Papua = Under the Australian Citizenship Act, only a person born outside Australia is eligible to apply for Australian citizenship by descent. This has caused an anomaly in that former Australian citizens born in the former Territory of Papua (not New Guinea) before independence, and who lost Australian citizenship on independence in 1975, are unable to recover it through this route even if they have a parent born in mainland Australia. This has been the subject of litigation in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court of Australia, which have ruled that the definition of Australia includes the former Territory of Papua prior to independence. This rules out the possibility of Australian citizenship by descent for a person born in Papua. However, section 21(7) of the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 allows certain persons born before independence in Papua to be granted Australian citizenship, where such a person has a parent born in Australia (as currently defined).(7) Application and eligibility for citizenship. Pledge of commitment The wording of the Oath of Allegiance taken by newly naturalising Australian citizens has changed over time. In 1973 the Oath's wording was: :I, A. B., renouncing all other allegiance, swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Australia, Her heirs and successors according to law, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen. Australia, however, never required new citizens to formally renounce their former citizenship under the law of that country. An equivalent wording was available in the form of a non-religious Affirmation for those who preferred. In 1986 the wording was changed to: : I swear by Almighty God that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Australia, Her heirs and successors according to law, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Australia and fulfil my duties as an Australian citizen. In 1994 the Oath was replaced with a Pledge of Commitment to Australia: :From this time forward, under God, :I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people, :whose democratic beliefs I share, :whose rights and liberties I respect, and :whose laws I will uphold and obey. All new citizens have the choice of making the pledge with (Pledge 1) or without (Pledge 2) the words 'under God'. Evidence of Australian citizenship There are cases where citizens need to show documentary evidence of their citizenship. =Applying for a job in Australia= Employers are required to check working rights when providing a job, so an Australian citizen needs to show evidence of their citizenship. According to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection this is either a valid Australian passport or simply a birth certificate. Photo identity is also required. Some employers, especially the government (e.g. NSW Police Force, and Human Services Victoria) have adopted more stringent requirements similar to the Passport requirement below. =Applying for social security benefits= Centrelink or Medicare may require proof of citizenship when applying for benefits under their programs especially the first time. Generally an Australian passport or a birth certificate along with photo identity will suffice, or for newborns, a \\"Newborn Child Declaration\\" issued by the hospital. =Applying for a passport= According to the Australian Passport Office, the following documents normally constitute evidence of Australian citizenship: 50px This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Australia license. * a valid Australian passport * an Australian passport that expired less than 3 years ago, was issued when over 16, and shows the correct current name, sex, date of birth and place of birth * an Australian passport issued on or after 1 January 2000, if born in Australia on or after 20 August 1986 * a birth certificate issued by or on behalf of an Australian state or territory (only for those born before 20 August 1986), * a birth certificate issued by or on behalf of an Australian state or territory with evidence of a parent being an Australian citizen or permanent resident at the time of birth (only for those born on or after 20 August 1986) being: **one parent's full birth certificate, showing the parent was born in Australia before 20 August 1986, or **one parent's Australian passport issued on or after 20 August 1986 that was valid for at least two years at the time of birth, or **one parent's Australian citizenship certificate detailing their acquisition of citizenship before birth, or **according to other sources, one parent's full birth certificate, showing the parent was born in Australia on or after 20 August 1986, and one of their parent's full birth certificate, showing the applicant's grandparent was born in Australia before 20 August 1986 (etc.) * a Certificate of Australian Citizenship (see below), * a Certificate of Australian Citizenship of an Adoption in accordance with the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption or bilateral arrangement * a Certificate of Evidence of Australian Citizenship, * an Australian naturalisation certificate (no longer issued), * extract of register of Australian Births Abroad (no longer maintained), * a certificate of Australian citizenship by descent extract document. Photo identity is generally required when applying for a passport. =Certificate of Australian Citizenship= A Certificate of Australian Citizenship is recognised as an identity document and can be used as proof of citizenship. It is generally issued once only to naturalised citizens at a citizenship ceremony (unless adopted by a citizen). It is A4 in size, has the full name, and date of birth of the holder, has a number on the front and back, and is signed by the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection or responsible minister at the time of issuance, and is dated the date of the ceremony. =Certificate of Evidence of Australian Citizenship= Australian citizens who do not have a citizenship certificate, have lost their original certificate, or wish to have a single document proving their citizenship, may apply for a \\"Certificate of Evidence of Australian Citizenship\\". Children born overseas, with one parent born overseas, may apply for an \\"Australian citizenship by descent extract document\\". Children naturalised as part of a parent's application for Australian citizenship before 1 July 2002 did not receive individual citizenship certificates. Instead, their details were included on the reverse of their parent's certificate. Such children can be issued with individual Certificates of Evidence of Australian Citizenship. =Photo identity= As citizenship documentation does not generally have a photo, in many cases separate photo identity is required to associate the citizenship documentation to the individual presenting. For this reason the Australian Passport provides a convenient document for proving both citizenship and photo identity in one document. Australians and British nationality When Australia created Australian citizenship on 26 January 1949, not all British subjects connected with Australia became Australian citizens on that date. The most notable exceptions were: * children born outside Australia to Australian fathers; and * women married to Australian men; where the child or woman had not entered Australia with a permanent entry permit before 26 January 1949. Under the terms of section 12(4) of the British Nationality Act 1948: * such persons acquired citizenship of the UK & Colonies (CUKC) on 26 January 1949 on the basis of being British subjects connected with Australia, if they did not have citizenship of, or connections with, another Commonwealth country or Ireland * where a person had connections with another Commonwealth country that had not introduced a citizenship law as of 26 January 1949, they acquired citizenship of the UK and Colonies on the date the other country introduced a citizenship law if they did not become a citizen of that country at the time, if they had not acquired Australian citizenship by that point. * A complication arises if the person had a connection with India or Pakistan and such a person may have remained a British subject without citizenship if he did not acquire Indian or Pakistani citizenship, or the citizenship of any other Commonwealth country or Ireland. Persons acquiring CUKC would have retained it upon a later acquisition of Australian citizenship. However they would only be British citizens today if they had obtained a 'right of abode' in the UK under the terms of the Immigration Act 1971, such as by having a UK-born grandparent. Otherwise they would be British Overseas citizens. British subjects without citizenship would have retained that status only if they did not acquire a Commonwealth nationality (or Irish citizenship) before 1983, or any citizenship from 1983 or later. British Overseas citizens and British subjects may register as British citizens if they have no other nationality (and have not lost another nationality since 4 July 2002), but otherwise do not have an automatic right to live in the United Kingdom. Commonwealth citizenship Under United Kingdom law, Australians are Commonwealth citizens and entitled to certain rights in the UK: * access to the UK youth mobility visa (working holiday visa) if between 18 and 30. (These are only available to citizens of Australia, Canada and New Zealand.) * for those with a UK-born grandparent, access to UK Ancestry Entry Clearance * for those born before 1983 who have a UK-born mother or are women who were married before 1 January 1983 to a man with the right of abode in the UK, the right of abode (those born before 1983, whether Commonwealth citizens or not, with a UK-born father are generally British citizens by descent) * for those living in the UK, the right to vote and stand for public office there. Similar rights accrue in some other Commonwealth jurisdictions. New Zealand residency Under the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement, Australian citizens and permanent residents are automatically granted a New Zealand residence class visa on arrival in New Zealand,http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2010/0241/latest/DLM3148128.html?search=sw_096be8ed8195de98_australia_25_se&p;=1 provided they: *Present a valid Australian passport, or a foreign passport with an Australian citizen declaratory visa. *Correctly complete a New Zealand Passenger Arrival Card. *Are of good character. Australian citizens who have ever been imprisoned for five years or more, been imprisoned in the past 10 years for one year or more, or have been deported or removed from any country, are not permitted to enter New Zealand. The visa entitles Australian citizens and permanent residents to live, work and study in New Zealand indefinitely, and expires once the Australian citizen or permanent resident leaves New Zealand. Citizenship, visas and travel Most non-citizens travelling to Australia must obtain a visa prior to travel. The only exceptions to this rule are members of the British royal family, who do not require a visa, and holders of both New Zealand citizenship and a New Zealand passport, who may apply for a Special Category Visa on arrival according to the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement. Definitions Australia means Australia together with its Territories * Norfolk Island is included from 1 July 2016. * Christmas Island is included from 1 October 1958 and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands from 23 November 1955. These are former United Kingdom territories transferred to Australia. * Papua ceased to be an Australian territory on 16 September 1975. British subject means a person connected with a Commonwealth country (not just the United Kingdom). The phrase was used in Australian law until 30 April 1987.

It is the successor to the Medical Research Council of Canada. It aims to create new health knowledge and to translate that knowledge from the research setting into real world applications. CIHR supports more than 13,000 researchers and trainees as part of the federal government's investment in health research. The peer review process is a vital part of CIHR. Review by panels of peers from the research community ensures that proposals approved for funding by CIHR meet internationally accepted standards of scientific excellence. CIHR combined with the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council forms the major source of federal government funding to post-secondary research, and are collectively referred to as the \\"Tri-Council\\".  History  CIHR was created by an Act of Parliament on June 7, 2000, bringing together existing government activities. CIHR's annual budget is approximately $1 billion.  Governance  CIHR is a Departmental Corporation listed in Schedule II of the Financial Administration Act. As an arms length agency of government, it is accountable to Parliament through the Minister of Health. CIHR is managed by the President and the members of Governing Council, who are assisted by various Standing and Advisory Committees. The President of CIHR is Michael Strong, an ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease) researcher, who began his term in October 2018.  Institute structure  CIHR consists of 13 \\"virtual\\" institutes, each headed by a Scientific Director and assisted by an Institute Advisory Board. They work together to shape a national health research agenda for Canada. The institutes bring together researchers, health professionals, and policy-makers from voluntary health organizations, provincial government agencies, international research organizations, and industry and patient groups from across the country with a shared interest in improving the health of Canadians. The work of the institutes embraces the four pillars of health research: # biomedical; # clinical; # health services; and # population health.

It comprises three components, Core, Media Player, and Server. Alluvium allows video and audio programming to be broadcast over the Internet using swarming technology. It is powered by Onion Networks' Swarmcast, and is notable for its incorporation of server-side time-based playlists, and client software which examines those playlists and begins streaming content from the server(and available peers) per that schedule, simplifying the creation of continuous-broadcast video and audio. Technical overview Alluvium is a technology for low-cost streaming media broadcasts. It differs in method from server-to-client streaming servers such as icecast, Real Server, and QuickTime Streaming Server. It requires only a standard web server and client software. No additional modules or CGI scripts are required for its operation. =Requirements=Web Server The web server handles static files: content, and the playlist(s). The Alluvium playlist file is a text file, residing on the web server, written in the Alluvium playlist format, which is based on the RSS 1.0 news format. The playlist file specifies the play order of URLs that can be hosted anywhere on the web. All RSS tags used are standard tags from existing schemas. An Alluvium playlist file can be generated using the Broadcaster playlist generation tool. The web server is configured to deliver Alluvium playlists with MIME type Content-Type: application/x-alluvium for files with the extension .rss Client software The client software, running on each listener's computer, scans through a playlist file until it finds an entry which is scheduled for the current time, then fetches that media. Files are downloaded using the Open Content Network (OCN) utilizing Swarmcast swarming download technology. After the first file download has started, the client immediately sends it to a locally generated icecast-compatible stream. The client's media player can then be directed to the local stream and listen to it exactly as though it was a normal icecast stream. =Swarming download operation= The client software first checks with the OCN gateway, which stores special headers for all of the files being distributed through the OCN. If the gateway doesn't know about a particular URL, it will fetch the necessary information from the URL and then cache it. The information stored by the gateway contains information needed to swarm download the file such as a hashtree. Among the information obtained by the client from the gateway is a list of addresses for other clients who are also downloading or have recently downloaded the file. Clients download multiple parts of the file simultaneously from each other. When a certain part of the file is unavailable from other clients, a client will fetch it from the original source URL and then share that part with the other clients, minimizing the load on the server which stores the content files. The majority of data transfer happens between peers. Priority for downloading is given to chunks earlier in the file, so that file playback can happen immediately. This swarming architecture offers savings in bandwidth and processor usage. Because most transfers happen between listeners, the source server has much less load. Also, unlike icecast, servers which serve files for Alluvium stations do not decode the files, so broadcasts can be done from low-cost, obsolete hardware with sufficiently fast I/O and network speeds. History Alluvium was developed as part of the Tristero project, hosted at Sourceforge, by Brandon Wiley. The source code, still in beta, is available as part of the Tristero project at tristero.cvs.sourceforge.net Alluvium was unveiled at CodeCon 2 in February 2003, generating interest in the peer-to-peer, open source, and streaming radio communities.Swarm Radio- a cheaper, faster 'casting tech The Register.

Paju√ßara is a beach and a neighborhood in Macei√≥, capital of Alagoas, in Brazil. The Est√°dio Severiano Gomes Filho is located in the neighborhood. This beach is approximately 2 km from downtown. It is a calm water beach thanks to the reefs, which make it safe for swimming, especially for children. Near the arts and crafts fair in Paju√ßara is also where the rafts leave for the natural pools formed by choral reefs, where the tourist will find floating bars. Geography Paju√ßara is localised in the South Zone. =Climate= Paju√ßara has a typical tropical climate, with warm to hot temperatures and high relative humidity all throughout the year. However, these conditions are relieved by a near absence of extreme temperatures and pleasant trade winds blowing from the ocean. January is the warmest month, with mean maxima of 31¬∞C and minima of 22¬∞C; July experiences the coolest temperatures, with means of 26¬∞C and 15¬∞C. The absolute maximum and minimum are respectively 33¬∞C and 11,3¬∞C. =Vegetation= Paju√ßara has a Tropical forest. Rainforests are characterized by high rainfall, with definitions setting minimum normal annual rainfall between 2,000 mm (about 78 inches or 2 meters) and 1700 mm (about 67 inches). The soil can be poor because high rainfall tends to leach out soluble nutrients. There are several common characteristics of tropical rainforest trees. Tropical rainforest species frequently possess one or more of the following attributes not commonly seen in trees of higher latitudes or trees in drier conditions on the same latitude. Demographics According to the 2006 census, the racial makeup of Ponta Verde district inhabitants was 95% White people and 5% Black people. People of Latin Europe descent form the largest ethnic groups in the district. Predominantly Roman Catholics religion and Portuguese language. Economy Paju√ßara is a vibrant tourist coastal area with Hotels and Pousadas (hostels), bars, nightclubs, pubs, good restaurants, etc. Tourism is the most important segment in the district, because Paju√ßara district has beautifuls beaches with their calm and blue waters, their reefs and corals. Thanks to the \\"barracas\\"(traditional restaurants/bars built on the beach sand, just close by the sea waters and resembling huge Amazonian-Indian straw huts), thanks to the modern buildings facing the sea (luxurious hotels and residential buildings), thanks to the running and cycling tracks and row of benches that follow the coastline like at Copacabana beach in Rio or Miami beach in the United States, thanks to the beach volley friendly practice and beach volley tournaments, and thanks to its beautiful squares and playgrounds, Paju√ßara is a place of entertainment, healthy activities, cultural activities, meeting, and nightlife.

He is the archenemy of the Swamp Thing, the protagonist of the comics. Fictional character biography Arcane is a scientist whose obsession with gaining immortality has led him to create monstrous creatures known as \\"Un-Men\\", as well as other monstrous biogenetic experimentations involving the dead. He was able to resurrect his deceased brother Gregori as the Patchwork Man. He is also a skilled magician, which he is able to channel through his horrific experiments. Living in the mountains of Europe with his niece Abigail, Arcane is introduced after he discovers and lures the plant- based hero to his castle home. Arcane sought to use his scientific and magical abilities to transform his body into the Swamp Thing's form, while changing the Swamp Thing back into Alec Holland. At first very grateful to be human again, Alec soon overheard Arcane discussing his evil intentions now that he could carry them out. Alec then succeeds in breaking the spell Arcane cast, and sacrifices his humanity, so Arcane becomes a frail old man again. Pursued by the Swamp Thing, Arcane fell to his death, only to be resurrected by his Un-Men in a new body. He then attacked the Swamp Thing twice more before truly dying, the first time as a hulking corpse-like Un-Man (only to be destroyed by the vengeful ghosts of African-American slaves who had possessed his Un-Men) and later as an insect-like cyborg piloting a massive dragonfly-like vehicle that is actually a tesseract (i.e., its interior is larger than its exterior). It is after his third death that his soul was consigned to Hell. Arcane's soul later escaped from Hell and ultimately helped to summon the demon Monkey King into the world. After a fight with Abigail that culminated in her leaving on foot to find the Swamp Thing, Matt Cable (Abigail's husband) had an attack of conscience and drove after her. He had been drinking heavily and wound up crashing his car, leaving him mortally wounded. Ultimately Arcane managed to possess Cable's body, and with it gained access to Cable's godlike power. In this body, he masquerades as Cable, claiming that he has a new job at a company called Blackriver Recorporations and is buying a mansion for them to live. Arcane combined his own magic with Cable's inherent psychic powers to alter reality and the employees of Blackriver Recorporations were the resurrected souls of deceased serial killers returned from Hell. He finally revealed himself, tormenting his niece and causing havoc and insanity by altering reality on a massive scale. For miles around natural and unnatural disasters occurred, people succumbed to homicidal instincts and the resurrected serial killers returned to killing. He once again battled the Swamp Thing, accompanied by monstrous forms resembling Un-Men, after killing Abigail and condemning her soul to Hell, all the while declaring Earth as his now. It was during this battle that Arcane found that the Swamp Thing was a plant elemental and thus possessed semi-magical abilities, allowing the Swamp Thing to combat him on a more even ground. The battle was enough for Matthew Cable to regain control of his body, and Arcane was exorcised directly back to Hell. Cable used his awakened power to resurrect Abigail's body, but not having sufficient power to repair himself, became comatose and finally died, whereupon he became Matthew, a raven living within the Dreaming. Arcane next appears as a demon, having been promoted to this status by the Lords of Hell. He attacks Swamp Thing yet again, only to be defeated. In a later episode, Arcane temporarily repents of his evil ways after having briefly found God, who eventually banishes him back to Hell. Arcane is tortured by the demon Josephine, whom he seduces into helping him escape. The Swamp Thing defeats the two demons, causing their forms to morph together, and when last seen, it is revealed that the Arcane/Josephine being is pregnant. =The New 52= In the wake of The New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Anton Arcane is a regular antagonist in the monthly Swamp Thing comics. After Abigail was able to fight off the mental control of Sethe, Sethe revives Anton Arcane from the dead.Swamp Thing (vol. 5) #9 (July 2012) as the avatar of the Black (a.k.a. the Rot), after which he tries to take over the Red (colliding with Animal Man as well) and the Green. Anton also has a son named William Arcane and Abigail is his daughter in this timeline.Swamp Thing (vol. 5) #0 (November 2012)Swamp Thing (vol. 5) #11 (September 2012) During Animal Man and the Swamp Thing's one year in the Rot, Anton Arcane and the forces of the Rot were able to take over parts of Earth. It was mentioned by Frankenstein that Anton Arcane had imprisoned someone beneath Metropolis.Animal Man (vol. 2) #15 (February 2013) When the forces of the Red and the forces of the Green converge outside of Anton Arcane's castle, Anton Arcane unleashes corrupted versions of Maxine Baker and Abigail Arcane.Animal Man (vol. 2) #17 (April 2013) Anton Arcane and the Rot's conquest of Earth is thwarted and undone when Maxine breaks the hold of the remaining Hunter's Three on her.Animal Man (vol. 2) #18 (May 2013) After being defeated by the Swamp Thing, Arcane is put in a Hell specifically made for him by the Parliament of Decay when nothing ever rots and all is forever pure. Abigail, as the new avatar of the Rot, comes to him demanding information about her mother. Arcane reveals that when she was a baby she already had power over the Rot and she accidentally killed her by 'filling' her with the Rot. To make him talk Abigail lets him feel rot, but she now says he will never escape his Hell and will never touch rot again. Arcane says that when he touched it when she gave it to him, he became stronger than he had been in ages and he will escape and take revenge on both her and Alec Holland. As she teleports away, Arcane rips out one of his eyes and throws it in the portal. On Earth, a boy is about to eat an apple when it turns rotten. He throws it away and Arcane's eye appears in it.Swamp Thing (vol. 5) #23.1 (September 2013) In Swamp Thing (vol. 5) #36, when the Swamp Thing goes in the Rot to warn Abigail about the new realm of machines, she initially assumes that he is there because of Arcane, who has escaped.Swamp Thing (vol. 5) #36 (November 2014) It is eventually shown that he has returned to Earth, but since he is not the avatar of the Rot, he can only gain strength from consuming rotten items, like corpses and garbage, and as such is terribly weakened. He joins forces with the new realm of Metal, which promises him the power that he lost, and his power does grow greatly in this time. He later poisons the Green from within, when the Swamp Thing is weakened in an attempt to destroy it, but this fails when all the avatars of the Green are awakened and use their power to cleanse the Green to its original state. Abigail challenges Arcane in the final war against Metal, and while she has the upper hand, Arcane eventually escapes. In Futures End, it is revealed that five years in the future, a series of events conspired to ensure that all avatars swore to stay off of Earth and within their own realms to prevent chaos. Arcane only agreed to this if he was allowed to bind himself to Abigail forever, as seen when his left hand and her right are completely fused in a twisted embrace and when he calls her his \\"daughter-wife\\". In doing so, he allowed himself to leech off her power, as the true avatar of the Rot, and ensuring that the Swamp Thing could not fight him, without risking harm or death to the one he loved. However, the Swamp Thing has made the decision to destroy the Rot, using the power of a Life through a White Lantern Ring. Arcane attempts to dissuade him, by citing the necessity of death and rot, but the Swamp Thing counters it by saying that fungi/the Grey and bacteria/the Divided have already decided to take over the role of rot, while Metal will keep them in check. Arcane then tries to give up Abigail, but the Swamp Thing believes that there is enough life in her to let her survive and in the worst case, death is better than the Hell that she lives in. Arcane briefly tries to fight back, but Abigail makes her move to distract him, long enough for the Swamp Thing to activate the White Lantern ring and bringing about the death of Anton Arcane. Powers and abilities Anton Arcane possesses genius-level intellect. He possesses the knowledge of creation of synthetic organs and skin, through which he made his Un-Men. He initially wanted to create a body and transfer his consciousness into it so he could make himself immortal within a tireless form instead of in his normal aged, worn body. He also possessed many arcane artifacts. He possesses necromancy which enables him to control the dead. In The New 52, Arcane was brought in as the avatar of the Rot just as Alec Holland is the avatar of the Green. As the avatar he could manipulate rot, death and decay to his will. His main objective was to simply help the spread of rot, but he caused a wave of carnage, as he thought that killing was the best sacrifice for the Rot. He then found a way of allowing rot in a living being, causing decay before death. When the Swamp Thing and Animal Man are trapped within the Rot, Arcane uses this 'living' rot on everyone, except those who have a strong enough connection to the Red (animals) or the Green (plants), such as Poison Ivy or the Man-Bat. There are ways to prevent the living rot, such as using the Man-Bat serum, but only if it is used before being completely controlled by it. These rot zombies can be weakened or even killed with Alec Holland's bio-restorative formula. Arcane's new Un-Men were normal people who gave themselves to the Rot.

Casson, \\"The Hyperboreans\\" The Classical Review 34.1/2 (February - March 1920:1‚Äì3); Bolton 1962 places them on the upper Irtysh and on the slopes of the Altai. All tales of their struggles with the gold-guarding griffins in the Hyperborean lands near the cave of Boreas, the North Wind (Geskleithron), had their origin in a lost work by Aristeas, reported in Herodotus.  Legendary Arimaspi  Battles between griffons and warriors in Scythian tunics and leggings were a theme for Greek vase-painters. Spiritual descendants of the one-eyed Arimaspi of Inner Asia may be found in the decorative borderlands of medieval maps and in the monstrous imagery of Hieronymus Bosch. The Arimaspi were described by Aristeas of Proconnesus in his lost archaic poem Arimaspea. Proconnesus is a small island in the Sea of Marmora near the mouth of the Black Sea, well situated for hearing travellers' tales of regions far north of the Black Sea. Aristeas narrates in the course of his poem that he was \\"wrapt in Bacchic fury\\" when he travelled to the north and saw the Arimaspians, as reported by Herodotus: > This Aristeas, possessed by Phoibos, visited the Issedones; beyond these (he > said) live the one-eyed Arimaspoi, beyond whom are the Grypes that guard > gold, and beyond these again the Hyperboreoi, whose territory reaches to the > sea. Except for the Hyperboreoi, all these nations (and first the Arimaspoi) > are always at war with their neighbors.Herodotus 4.13.1 Arimaspi and griffins remained stock images associated with the outlands of the north: the Aeschylan Prometheus Bound (ca 415 BC?), describing the wanderings of Io, notes that she is not to pass through the north, among the Arimaspi and griffins, but southward.J.L. Myres, \\"The Wanderings of Io: Aeschylus, Prometheus, 707‚Äì869\\", The Classical Review 60.1 (April 1946:2‚Äì4). Herodotus, \\"Father of History\\", admits the fantastic allure of the edges of the known world: \\"The most outlying lands, though, as they enclose and wholly surround all the rest of the world, are likely to have those things which we think the finest and the rarest.\\" (Histories iii.116.1) Ignoring the scepticism of Herodotus, Strabo and Pliny's Natural History perpetuated the fables about the northern people who had a single eye in the center of their foreheads and engaged in stealing gold from the griffins, causing disagreements between the two groups.  Historical Arimaspi  Modern historians speculate on historical identities that may be selectively extracted from the brief account of \\"Arimaspi\\". Herodotus recorded a detail recalled from Arimaspea that may have a core in fact: \\"the Issedones were pushed from their lands by the Arimaspoi, and the Scythians by the Issedones\\" (iv.13.1). The \\"sp\\" in the name suggests that it was mediated through Iranian sources to Greek, indeed in Early Iranian Arimaspi combines Ariama (love) and Aspa (horses). Herodotus or his source seems to have understood the Scythian word as a combination of the roots arima (\\"one\\") and spou (\\"eye\\") and to have created a mythic image to account for it. Similarity of name and location, could identify them with the ancestors of the local Uralic people, the Mari. It has been suggested that the griffins were inferred from the fossilized bones of Protoceratops.Adrienne Mayor & Michael Heaney, ‚ÄòGriffins and Arimaspeans‚Äô in Folklore, Vol. 104, No. 1/2, 1993, pp. 40‚Äì66, The brief report of Herodotus seems to be very flimsy ground for making unequivocal statements about the historical background out of which the legend emerged. Notwithstanding these reservations, Tadeusz Sulimirski (1970) claims that the Arimaspi were a Sarmatian tribe originating in the upper valley of the River Irtysh, while Dmitry Machinsky (1997) associates them with a group of three- eyed ajna figurines from the Minusinsk Depression, traditionally attributed to the Afanasevo and Okunevo cultures of southern Siberia.Machinsky, D.

St. Petersburg, 1997:3.  Mythological background  As philologists have noted, the struggle between the Arimaspi and the griffins has remarkable similarities to Homer's account of the Pygmaioi warring with cranes. Michael Rostovtzeff found a rendering of the subject in the Vault of Pygmies near Kerch, a territory that used to have a significant Scythian population.The 2nd-century BC tomb \\"shows the battle of human pygmies with a flock of herons\\".

He has played in the Football League for Leeds United, Ipswich Town, Cardiff City, Queens Park Rangers, Hull City, Plymouth Argyle, Blackpool, Crewe Alexandra, Stevenage, and Crawley Town. Walton was capped by England at under-16, under-17 and under-19 level. Career=Leeds United= Born in Sherburn-in-Elmet, Walton started his career at hometown club Leeds United. He came to attention after being sent off in a pre-season friendly against Valencia in 2004, whilst still just sixteen. He was likened to former Elland Road heroes Alan Smith and David Batty. He made his competitive debut on 7 August 2004 against Derby County, and went on to score three goals in the 2004‚Äì05 season, Leeds' first in the Championship. Walton struggled to break into the first team during the 2005‚Äì06 season with his only appearances coming after injuries to Sean Gregan, Shaun Derry, Jonathan Douglas and Gylfi Einarsson. =Charlton Athletic= In July 2006 he joined Premier League side Charlton Athletic for an initial fee of ¬£500,000, with clauses that could create a total ¬£1m fee. He quickly moved on loan to get some regular first-team football, moving to Ipswich Town three games into the Championship season on 18 August 2006. Walton scored several important goals for Ipswich before being loaned to another Championship side, Cardiff City, in January 2007. When playing for Cardiff, he was sent off against former club Leeds for two bookable offences. =Queens Park Rangers= Walton joined Championship side Queens Park Rangers on 27 July 2007 in a ¬£200,000 deal, having never played a competitive game for Charlton. Shortly afterwards, he broke his leg in a friendly against Fulham.

Originally proclaimed as a club record signing at ¬£750,000, the initial fee paid was well below the ¬£500,000 paid to Cardiff City for Steve MacLean and never surpassed it prior to the club being placed in administration in March 2011. Walton made his debut for Plymouth in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Wolves on 9 August. On 22 December 2008 Walton was placed on the transfer list by Paul Sturrock after being sent off in a league match against Barnsley. Sturrock questioned Walton's attitude and temperament after some abject performances, and rash decisions by the player. On 26 March 2009 he joined Blackpool on loan until the end of the season. He made his debut on 11 April as a 74th-minute substitute in Blackpool's 1‚Äì0 West Lancashire Derby win over Preston North End at Deepdale. On 31 August 2009 he joined Crewe Alexandra on loan for the 2009‚Äì10 season. Walton joined Sheffield United on a season-long loan in July 2010. However, he suffered cruciate knee ligament damage during his first outing for the club in a pre-season friendly which proved to be a long-term injury. Following a recovery period at Bramall Lane his parent club, Plymouth Argyle, agreed to terminate his loan and recall him at the start of September. On 5 April 2011, Walton made his first appearance for nine months, and his first for Argyle since 2008, against Leyton Orient. Walton scored his first goal in the match against MK Dons on 25 April 2011. After the club appointed Carl Fletcher as caretaker manager the captaincy was handed to Walton who has become one of the senior players in the young squad. Walton has subsequently scored several goals, some as penalties, including a brace against Burton Albion on 14 January 2012. Walton had his contract extended until the end of the 2012‚Äì13 season in April 2012. Manager Carl Fletcher revealed that Walton had agreed a new deal the previous autumn when the club was in the process of being bought by businessman James Brent. \\"He signed a new deal during the takeover to benefit the club,\\" said Fletcher in an interview with BBC Radio Devon. \\"He agreed terms on a deal when the club was being taken over to help and aid the club in getting it out of administration.\\" =Hartlepool United= Walton was released by Plymouth in July 2012 so he could be closer to his daughter, and signed for Hartlepool United on 6 July. =Stevenage= Walton signed for Stevenage on 30 June 2014 on a free transfer. =Crawley Town= Walton signed for Crawley Town on 18 June 2015 on a free transfer on a two-year deal. =Maidstone United= On 12 October 2018, Walton joined Maidstone United permanently after a short-term loan. At the end of December 2018, Tristan Lewis was appointed caretaker manager, with Walton as his assistant.Stones TV: Big interview with Tristan and Simon, maidstoneunited.co.uk, 28 December 2018 =Havant & Waterlooville= On 11 May 2019, Havant & Waterlooville announced that Walton had joined the club as a player / coach.SIMON WALTON JOINS THE HAWKS AS PLAYER COACH, havantandwaterloovillefc.co.uk, 11 May 2019 Personal life Walton began dating Nicola Tappenden, a glamour model, in 2007 and they went on to be engaged.

She represented the third congressional district of Washington as a Democrat. Unsoeld was born Jolene Bishoprick in Corvallis, Oregon, on December 3, 1931. She attended Oregon State University from 1949 to 1951. She is the widow of Willi Unsoeld, a mountaineer and later college professor. Accompanying Willi to the Himalayas, she spent two years as director of the English Language Institute of Kathmandu, Nepal. Unsoeld spent the 1970s and early 1980s as the conscience of the Washington State Legislature. She was one of the leaders of the campaign for Initiative 276, passed in 1972, which created the Washington Public Disclosure Commission, and required disclosure of campaign contributions by candidates for elective office. She was a citizen lobbyist in support of open government, including open public meetings and open public records. In 1977 she and Willi became concerned about proposed nuclear power plants, and joined in forming Fair Electric Rates Now (FERN), which was a ratepayer and environmental group that worked for many years opposing utility investment in nuclear energy, encouraging investment in energy conservation, and supporting utility rate design that rewarded consumers who used less power. In 1984, she ran for the office of state representative, and served two terms in the state legislature prior to running for Congress in 1988. During her three terms in Congress she worked hardest on the federal Freedom of Information Act, but became best known for her opposition to gun control, although very liberal on other issues. She lost her bid for re-election in the Republican Revolution of 1994 to Linda Smith. In 2008, the Washington Coalition for Open Government bestowed the James Madison Award on Unsoeld.

History A map of the campus as it was in 1924. The cemetery can be seen near the middle of the map In 1868 the Naval Academy purchased a 67-acre piece of land called Strawberry Hill as part of their efforts to expand after the American Civil War. Within a year of its acquisition part of the property became the cemetery. Since its beginning the cemetery has become the final resting place for Medal of Honor recipients, Superintendents of the Naval Academy, midshipmen, and former employees of the Academy and hundreds more of the nation's veterans. The cemetery is also home to monuments that do not mark remains, but commemorate the heroism of individuals who gave their life in service to their country. The Jeannette Monument, erected in 1890, is the most notable such monument. It was built in memory of the men who lost their lives in the Jeannette Arctic Expedition. Columbarium In 1987, the Naval Academy constructed a columbarium adjacent to the cemetery on College Creek. The columbarium was built by the Naval Academy Alumni Association with $500,000 in gifts from alumni and friends of the Academy. This included a major grant from the George and Carol Olmsted Foundation in memory of Jerauld L. Olmsted, Class of 1922.

Career A native of Chicago, Lang began her dance training as a child and studied acting at the Goodman Theatre. Her dance teacher was Frances Allis who taught movement for actors as well as her own modern dance technique which has many similarities to Graham's. Lang studied Allis technique and performed with her company in Chicago. In 1938, at the age of 17, she enrolled in a program for gifted students at the University of Chicago, where she remained until 1941, the year of her move to New York. Born Pearl Lack, she adopted the stage name, \\"Pearl Lang\\", she studied with Martha Graham and Louis Horst and joined the Martha Graham Dance Company where she remained as a soloist from 1942 to 1952, and as a guest artist from 1954 through the late 1970s.Tracy, Robert. Goddess: Martha Graham's Dancers Remember. New York: Proscenium Publishers, 1996. She was the first woman to dance Martha Graham's roles in seven dances of Graham repertoire which she performed intermittently for thirty years to critical and audience acclaim. She was an original cast member in Deaths and Entrances, Punch and the Judy, Land Be Bright, Imagined Wing, Diversion of Angels, Canticle for Innocent Comedians, Ardent Song, Dark Meadow, Night Journey, Eye of Anguish, and Appalachian Spring. She was also a featured dancer in Broadway productions of Carousel (1945‚Äì47), Finian's Rainbow, and Peer Gynt.Pearl Lang Dance Theater, 2001‚Äì02 Season, Danny Kaye Playhouse. In 1952, she founded her own company, Pearl Lang Dance Theater, for which she choreographed sixty-three works, thirty-six of which were based on Jewish themes. She choreographed for film, opera, and television and her works have been performed by the Dutch National Ballet, Boston Ballet, and the Batsheva Dance Company of Israel. In 1970, she invited Alvin Ailey and his company to share a three-story building with her dance company at 229 East 59th Street in Manhattan where, together, they co- directed the American Dance Center as a joint school. Pearl Lang Dance Theater's last New York season was held at the Danny Kaye Playhouse in 2001. Among the many citations and awards that Lang received are two Guggenheim Fellowships for Choreography; the Martha Graham Award for Performance and Choreography; The Workmen's Circle Award for her contribution to Jewish Culture through Dance; the Achievement Award from the Artists and Writers for Peace in the Middle East; the Achievement Award from the Congress for Jewish Culture; the Cultural Achievement Award from the National Foundation for Jewish Culture; Queens College Award for Excellence in Jewish Art, and from the Juilliard School, an Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts on May 19, 1995. In 1997, she was inducted into the Hall of Fame by the International Committee for The Dance Library of Israel. In 2001 at the American Dance Festival she received the award for \\"Lifetime Distinguished Teaching\\".Pearl Lang Dance Theatre, 2001-2002 Season, Danny Kaye Playhouse. As a teacher, Lang reached generations of young dancers. She served on the faculties of Yale University from 1954 to 1968, Juilliard School of Music from 1952 to 1969, Connecticut College and Neighborhood Playhouse from 1963 to 1968, and the Martha Graham School of Contemporary Dance up until shortly before her death.

In 1999, Basic Rights launched the Fair Workplace Project, which was designed to increase the number of employers voluntarily adopting nondiscrimination policies. In 2002, Basic Rights Oregon endorsed Democratic candidate Bill Bradbury for election to the United States Senate, opposing the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT rights organization, which endorsed the re-election of the Republican incumbent Gordon H. Smith.New York Times: Todd S. Purnam, \\"Campaign Season; The Awkward Endorsement Game,\\" October 20, 2001, accessed June 2, 2012 In 2004, Basic Rights Oregon, nine same-sex couples, the American Civil Liberties Union, and Multnomah County joined as plaintiffs against the State of Oregon, the Governor, the Attorney General, the Director of the Department of Human Services, and the State Registrar in a suit, Li v. State, in the Oregon Supreme Court seeking a declaration that the statutes (ORS chapter 106) prohibiting same-sex couples from marrying on the same terms as different-sex couples violated the Oregon Constitution. In 2004, Basic Rights Oregon worked against Ballot Measure 36, which amended the Oregon Constitution to prohibit same-sex marriage. Although Basic Rights Oregon raised nearly $3 million to fight the measure, it passed with 57% in favor and 43% opposed. Following this loss, Basic Rights Oregon hired its first team of field organizers and pushed nondiscrimination ordinances in Washington County, Bend, Hillsboro, and Wasco County. In 2007, Basic Rights led the lobbying effort to pass the Oregon Equality Act and the Oregon Family Fairness Act. In 2012, following years of education and collaboration with Basic Rights Oregon, the state Insurance Division issued a bulletin banning many private insurers from selling discriminatory policies in Oregon. In 2015, in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling on Marriage Equality, Basic Rights Oregon adopted a new strategic direction for 2015-2020. The new strategic direction seeks to center the voices of LGBTQ people of color, of rural and religious LGBTQ Oregonians, and of transgender and gender non-conforming Oregonians. In 2015, Oregon became the third state to ban the discredited practice of Conversion therapy on minors. Basic Rights Oregon worked to pass HB2307, the Youth Mental Health Protection Act, which was signed into law by Gov. Kate Brown, the nation's only out Bi-sexual governor. In 2017 Oregon passed HB 2673A - effective January 1, 2018 - simplifying the process for changing the name on a birth certificate, and also establishing a gender amendment process for transgender citizens. The revisions provide less expensive, more private and simpler transactions.http://www.basicrights.org/news/oregons-remarkable-year- transgender-justice/ and Diane Goodwin, Basic Rights Oregon The Department of Motor Vehicles also changed its procedure for gender changes on IDs, allowing Oregonians to self-certify gender change without input from their health provider.

Its most memorable lines are, \\"Anything you can do I can do better; I can do anything better than you.\\" The song was first performed in Annie Get Your Gun by Ethel Merman and Ray Middleton. During the song, they argue playfully about who can, for example, sing softer, sing higher, sing sweeter, and hold a note for longer, and boast of their abilities and accomplishments, such as opening safes and living on bread and cheese, although Annie always seems to counter Frank's argument.

He died in Japanese-occupied Dutch East Indies, likely executed. Early years Yu Dafu Yu was born in Fuyang, Zhejiang province. His father died when he was three, leaving the family poverty-stricken and destitute. He received a number of scholarships through the Chinese government and went on to receive a traditional Chinese education in Hangzhou. Chronologically he studied in Jiangxing Middle School (before he came to Hangzhou), Hangzhou Middle School, Yuying Academy (ËÇ≤Ëã±Â≠¶Â†Ç, formerly of Zhejiang University). In 1912, he entered Hangchow University (later its major part merged into Zhejiang University) preparatory through examination. He was there only for a short period before he was expelled for participation in a student strike. He then moved to Japan, where he studied economics at the Tokyo Imperial University between 1913 and 1922, where he met other Chinese intellectuals (namely, Guo Moruo, Zhang Ziping and Tian Han). Together, in 1921 they founded the Chuangzao she ÂâµÈÄ†Á§æ (\\"Creation Society\\"), which promoted vernacular and modern literature. He published one of his earlier works, the short story Chenlun (Ê≤âÊ∑™, Sinking), his most famous, while still in Japan in 1921. The work had gained immense popularity in China, shocking the world of Chinese literature with its frank dealing with sex, as well as grievances directed at the incompetence of Chinese government at the time. In 1922, he returned to China as a literary celebrity and worked as the editor of Creation Quarterly, editing journals and writing short stories. In 1923, after an attack of tuberculosis, Yu Dafu directed his attention to the welfare of the masses. In 1927, he worked as an editor of the Hongshui literary magazine. He later came in conflict with the Communist Party of China and fled back to Japan. Second Sino-Japanese war After the start of the Second Sino- Japanese war, he returned to China and worked as a writer of anti-Japanese propaganda in Hangzhou. From 1938 to 1942, he worked as a literary editor for the newspaper Sin Chew Jit Poh in Singapore. In 1942 when the Imperial Japanese Army invaded Singapore, he was forced to flee to Pajakoemboeh, Sumatra, Indonesia. Known under a different identity, he settled there among other overseas Chinese and began a brewery business with the help of the locals. Later he was forced to help the Japanese military police as an interpreter when it was discovered that he was one of the few \\"locals\\" in the area who could speak Japanese. In 1945, he was arrested by the Kempeitai when his true identity was finally discovered. It is believed that he was executed by the Japanese shortly after the surrender of Japan.

The alleged 'decadence' of Yu Dafu's novels, whether in a pejorative or in an aesthetic sense (i.e.'Decadence' as an artistic movement) has been considered by some Chinese Marxist critics to be a sign of Yu Dafu's moral corruption,Shu-Mei Shih 2001, The Lure of the Modern: Writing Modernism in Semi-Colonial China, 1917-1937 but Shih argues that Yu Dafu's writings constitute a serious-minded critique of China's political plight and perceived social conformism. Indeed, concern for the person and for the nation are intimately linked in his work, and the effeminate and ailing body serves as a metaphor for the weak and sickly nation.

(1975) is a piano composition by American composer Frederic Rzewski. The People United is a set of 36 variations on the Chilean song \\"¬°El pueblo unido jam√°s ser√° vencido!\\" by Sergio Ortega and Quilapay√∫n, and received its world premiere on February 7, 1976, played by Ursula Oppens as part of the Bi-Centennial Piano Series at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts Concert Hall. Rzewski dedicated the composition to Oppens, who had commissioned it, and who recorded it in 1979; her recording was named \\"Record of the Year\\" in that year by Record World, and received a Grammy nomination. Analysis The song on which the variations is based is one of many that emerged from the Unidad Popular coalition in Chile between 1969 and 1973, prior to the overthrow of the Salvador Allende government. Rzewski composed the variations in September and October 1975, as a tribute to the struggle of the Chilean people against the newly imposed repressive regime of Augusto Pinochet; indeed the work contains allusions to other leftist struggles of the same and immediately preceding time, such as quotations from the Italian traditional socialist song \\"Bandiera Rossa\\" and the Bertolt Brecht-Hanns Eisler \\"Solidarity Song.\\" In general, the variations are short, and build up to climaxes of considerable force. The 36 variations, following the 36 bars of the tune, are in six groups of six. The pianist, in addition to needing a virtuoso technique, is required to whistle, slam the piano lid, and catch the after-vibrations of a loud attack as harmonics: all of these are \\"extended\\" techniques in 20th-century piano writing. Much of the work uses the language of 19th-century romanticism, but mixes this language with pandiatonic tonality, modal writing, and even serial techniques. As in the Goldberg Variations by Johann Sebastian Bach, the final variation is a direct restatement of the original theme, intended to be heard with new significance after the long journey through the variations.

Regarded as a preeminent and very proficient left winger, D≈æajiƒá has been known for his \\"great crosses and passes, unstoppable dribbling with great pace, natural technique and some of the best left footed free kicks ever seen\\". D≈æajiƒá is viewed by some football experts as perhaps one of the most underrated players in European football, partly because he played in Yugoslavia. In December 2011, D≈æajiƒá was named in being part of \\"the greatest European Championship XI of all time\\" by Goal.com. Club career Born on 30 May 1946, in the small town of Ub, 60 kilometres outside Belgrade, D≈æajiƒá's football career (1961‚Äì1978) was spent primarily with Red Star Belgrade. D≈æajiƒá was a brilliant left winger who guided a Red Star Belgrade career spanning 590 games and 287 goals by winning five league titles and four Yugoslavian Cups. In 1969, D≈æajiƒá received the Sport newspaper's Golden Badge award for Yugoslavia's best athlete. He is considered to have been one of the most important players in the history of the club and is one of only five players to have been awarded the Zvezdine Zvezde status. In 2013, D≈æajiƒá was identified as the greatest Yugoslavian player of all time, and honoured by his inclusion alongside Pele in the best Sheep Draft team of the year. =Red Star Belgrade=Early starter D≈æajiƒá was plucked from the relative obscurity of his local club, FK Jedinstvo, by Red Star Belgrade youth coach Miljan Miljaniƒá, spending two years in the club's youth system. Though only 17 years and 8 days of age, D≈æajiƒá was handed his first team debut by head coach Mi≈°a Paviƒá in a Yugoslav First League match against FK Buduƒánost Titograd on 8 June 1963, which finished 0‚Äì0. It was the last week of the 1962‚Äì63 league season with FK Partizan already clinching the league championship and Red Star hovering in 7th place, out of European spots.D≈æajin debi za Zvezdu ‚Äì 8. juna 1963.;Mondo.rs, 8 June 2013 The match was played at Omladinski Stadium at Karaburma because Red Star's famous home Marakana was in the final construction stages. D≈æajiƒá might have started out as a left-back, but it was further up the flank that he made his impact. Red Star Belgrade's resident # 11 was an expert dribbler whose sweet left foot provided countless goals for teammate Vojin Lazareviƒá, his right wasn't bad either. D≈æajiƒá was rewarded for his brilliance with championship medals in 1964, 1968, 1969, 1970 and 1973, while he lifted the cup in 1964, 1968, 1970 and 1971. Semi-final defeat European Champion Clubs' Cup success very nearly came his way too. In the 1970‚Äì71 season, Red Star Belgrade reached the semi-finals of the top continental club competition, and beat Panathinaikos FC 4‚Äì1 in the first leg in Belgrade. D≈æajiƒá was suspended for the return in Athens, however, which the Greek team won 3‚Äì0 to go through on away goals. =Bastia= From 1975 to 1977, he played for SC Bastia in France (scoring another 31 times). He is considered to have been one of their most notable players of all time. International career D≈æajiƒá said about his most well-known international matches (at the UEFA Euro 1968): D≈æajiƒá was just 18 when he was first named to the Yugoslav national team. He made his debut on 17 June 1964 in a 2‚Äì1 defeat against Romania at the JNA Stadium in Belgrade. D≈æajiƒá would go on to earn 85 caps (the most in the history of the Yugoslav national team) and score 23 goals. He became renowned for his passing, dribbling and goal-scoring. His most famous international match was likely the 1968 European Championship semifinal against England, in which his 87th-minute lob over the goalkeeper Gordon Banks gave Yugoslavia a 1‚Äì0 victory against the defending world champions. The British press dubbed him \\"the magic Dragan.\\" He went on to score in the final against Italy but he could not prevent Yugoslavia losing 2‚Äì0 after a replay. Jan Olsson at the 1974 FIFA World Cup He participated in the 1974 FIFA World Cup which was held in West Germany. D≈æajiƒá participated in Yugoslavia's opening championship game draw with world champions Brazil and scored one goal in a record victory of 9‚Äì0 against Zaire. However, after passing the second stage of the championship, Yugoslavia didn't repeat the results of their opening games. They lost three games in a row, and had to return home. Administrative D≈æajiƒá retired as a player in 1978, at the age of 32. Right away, he began performing a role as Red Star's technical director. In his first season in the new administrative role, the club reached the UEFA Cup final. D≈æajiƒá became the main decision-maker within the club when it comes to transfer policy. In 1998, D≈æajiƒá became the club's president ‚Äì a position he resigned from in 2004 due to health issues. =Corruption allegations and presidential abolition= On 31 January 2011, the trial started in which D≈æajiƒá was charged of fraud perpetrated during the sale of players from Red Star Belgrade during D≈æajiƒá's time as the president of the club, specifically Nemanja Vidiƒá. D≈æajiƒá pleaded not guilty. The charges against Nemanja Vidiƒá were dropped. Nemanja Vidiƒá also denied all accusations against Dragan D≈æajiƒá. Many of the people believe that football \\"agents\\" wanted D≈æajiƒá \\"out of business\\" because he had too much influence in Balkan's football market. On 16 November 2012, Tomislav Nikoliƒá, the President of Serbia, signed an exempt from criminal liability of all charges. This abolition ended all proceedings against D≈æajiƒá.http://www.b92.net/eng/news/crimes- article.php?yyyy=2012&mm;=11‚ÖÜ=16&nav;_id=83193 =Return to Red Star and Re- election as president 2012= It was stated by local Serbian newspapers in the beginning of December 2011 that D≈æajiƒá would return to the administration of Red Star, as it was believed that D≈æajiƒá was the only one who could get Red Star back on track. However, nothing came of this. D≈æajiƒá spoke to Blic (tabloid daily newspaper in Serbia) after the board meeting, saying: \\"I spoke with people from the club, the desire to return was not disputed, I wanted to help, because everything that I previously experienced with the club cannot be forgotten. I followed, listened to and read what happened at the meeting, I wanted to come back but nothing happened and life goes on. I remain available and in this case I can only wish Red Star better days.\\" On 19 December 2012, D≈æajiƒá was elected as Red Star President for the third time.

Ahead of the last draw for the finals of Euro 2012, Goal.com looked back at all the past tournaments since the first edition in 1960 to select a best-ever XI. The greatest European Championship XI of all time featuring Zidane, Van Basten and Maldini also featured Dragan D≈æajiƒá. The players were chosen based on their performances for their countries in the European Championship only. Author of the text said: \\"Regarded by some as Europe's greatest ever left winger, D≈æajiƒá was Euro '68's best player. He scored the semi-final winner versus England with a delightful lob before opening the scoring in the final against Italy. Yugoslavia were set to triumph until a late equaliser from Angelo Domenghini forced a replay that Italy won 2‚Äì0. In 1976, he was again up to mischief as he ran West Germany ragged in the semis, scoring to put Yugoslavia 2‚Äì0 up. Germany forced extra-time with a late comeback and eventually won 4‚Äì2.

In 2013 he was unanimously elected the Oriental Orthodox head of the World Council of Churches for the next eight years. Biography Karekin II was born as Ktrij Nersessian in Voskehat, Armenia, on August 21, 1951. He entered the Gevorkian Theological Seminary at Echmiadzin in 1965 and graduated with honors in 1971. He was ordained to the diaconate in 1970. Later he became a monk and was ordained a priest in 1972. In the late 1970s the Catholicos of that period encouraged him to study outside of Armenia. This led to him continuing his studies in Vienna, Bonn University, and Zagorsk, Russia. On October 23, 1983, he was consecrated bishop at Echmiadzin. He became an archbishop in 1992. Karekin II speaks fluent German from his time in Germany and Austria. In 1975 during his time in Cologne he was the spiritual representative of nine Armenian congregations in Germany. In 1988 Karekin took an active role in helping his people overcome the Armenian earthquake. He oversaw the construction of a number of churches and schools in Armenia. He also showed an interest in using modern technology and telecommunications to help the life of his churches as well as dealing with the legacies of the Soviet era. On 27 October 1999 he was elected the 132nd Catholicos of All Armenians at the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, succeeding Karekin I. His relations with Pope John Paul II were generally positive. When the Pope visited Armenia in 2001, he stayed with the Catholicos. In 2006 Karekin made a week-long visit to Istanbul, Turkey, to meet with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I and to visit the city's Armenian community. During his visit he caused controversy by speaking out about the Armenian Genocide, which Turkey vehemently denies, and insisting on its recognition by Turkey. In October 2007, he began a second visit to the United States. On October 10, 2007, he offered the opening prayer for the day's session of the United States House of Representatives. His ecumenical trip to India to meet Baselios Thoma Didymos I, Catholicos of the East in November 2008, helped strengthen relations between the Armenian and Indian Orthodox Churches. The delegates to the 10th General Assembly of the World Council of Churches that took place in Busan, South Korea, on November 4, unanimously elected Catholicos of All Armenians Karekin II, the supreme patriarch and head of the Armenian Apostolic Church, head of the organization for the next eight years. On 26 June 2016, Catholicos Karekin and Pope Francis signed a joint declaration on the family. It stated that the secularization of society and its \\"alienation from the spiritual and divine\\" are damaging to the family, and affirmed that the Catholic and Armenian Apostolic churches share a marriage‚Äìbased view of the family. The declaration also took note of various positive steps taken towards unity between the two leaders' churches, and \\"acknowledged the successful 'new phase' in relations\\" between them. It also lamented \\"immense tragedy\\" of the widespread persecution of Christians in the Middle East; the Pope and the Catholicos prayed \\"for a change of heart in all those who commit such crimes and those who are in a position to stop the violence\\".

Early life Griesbach was born in Fort Qu'Appelle, North-West Territories, the son of Henry Arthur Griesbach, a North-West Mounted Police officer. In 1883, Henry was transferred to command Fort Saskatchewan; the family travelled on the Canadian Pacific Railway to Calgary and then by wagon train to Edmonton and Fort Saskatchewan, on occasion having to build or repair bridges in order to cross rivers. William Griesbach left the rest of the family in 1891 in order to attend St. John's College in Winnipeg, from which he graduated in 1895. Upon graduating, he returned to Edmonton and worked in a law firm for two years and in the Imperial Bank for one year, before returning to Fort Saskatchewan to work in a milling business for six months. He returned to Edmonton to study law. Boer War and legal career Griesbach enlisted with the Canadian Mounted Rifles in 1899 to fight in the Second Boer War. He knew from being weighed in at boxing tournaments that he fell short of the minimum weight to enlist, so on his way to being weighed he surreptitiously grabbed a large piece of coal from the enlistment centre's coal box and held it behind his back while he stood on the scales. During his service, he was awarded the Queen's South Africa Medal and received four bars. Griesbach as a member of the 19th Alberta Dragoons Upon his return in 1901, he opened a law office of his own. An Edmonton Bulletin article in 1927 quoted him as saying of these early years Pre-war political career Griesbach in his earlier days Griesbach's first bid for political office took place in the 1903 Edmonton election, when he made an unsuccessful bid for election to Edmonton Town Council, placing fourth of nine candidates in an election in which the top three were elected. He was more successful in the 1904 election when he was elected to a one-year term as an alderman to Edmonton's first city council placing eighth of seventeen candidates (in that first election as a city, Edmonton elected four aldermen to two year terms and four to one year terms, with the idea that four of the city's eight aldermen would be elected to two year terms each year). He was re-elected to a two-year term in 1905, finishing first of ten candidates. That same year, he ran as a Conservative in the riding of Edmonton in Alberta's first provincial election. He was defeated by Liberal Charles Cross, and continued his service on city council. Griesbach resigned as alderman one year into his term in order to run for mayor in the 1906 election. He was victorious, collecting more than sixty percent of the vote in a three-person race and becoming, at twenty-eight years old, the youngest mayor in the city's history, before or since. He served a one-year term, but did not seek re-election and stayed out of municipal politics thereafter. He ran as a Conservative in the 1911 federal election, finishing second of three candidates in the riding of Edmonton (the victorious candidate was Liberal Frank Oliver). Griesbach's final involvement in provincial politics would come during the 1913 election, when he ran as a Conservative in Edmonton. He finished fourth of five candidates. World War I In 1906, Griesbach was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 19th Alberta Dragoons. He was promoted to captain in 1907 When World War I broke out, the Dragoons volunteered as a unit. In December of that year, Griesbach was promoted to major assigned to command the 49th Battalion. He was able to recruit 1000 men in eight days in January 1915. The unit served in various engagements, including the Battle of Vimy Ridge, the Battle of Arras, the Third Battle of Ypres, and the liberation of Mons. In 1917, Griesbach was promoted to Brigadier-General and assigned command of the 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade of the 1st Canadian Division. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order twice and the Victorian Decoration for long service. He was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath and Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George. During World War II, he was made Inspector General of the Canadian Army for Western Canada, and was promoted to the rank of Major- General. He retired from that position in 1943. Griesbach in Full Dress as Inspector-General Federal Parliament William Griesbach was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Government member for the riding of Edmonton West in the 1917 election, defeating incumbent Laurier Liberal Frank Oliver. He served until 15 September 1921 (less than three months before the 1921 election), when he was appointed to the Senate of Canada, in which he served until his death. Personal life, death, and legacy Griesbach was an accomplished cyclist and played ice hockey and soccer for Edmonton teams. He was a member of the Masonic Order, the Oddfellows, the Edmonton Veteran Association, the Canadian Club, and the Northern Alberta Pioneer and Old Timers' Association. In 1906, he married Janet Scott McDonald Lauder. William Antrobus Griesbach died in Edmonton on January 21, 1945, of a sudden heart attack. CFB Griesbach, the Griesbach Garrison (part of CFB Edmonton), Griesbach Masonic Lodge, and Edmonton's Griesbach neighbourhood are named in his honour. Mount Griesbach in the Victoria Cross Ranges of Jasper National Park is also named in his honor.

She was a recipient of the Andrei Sakharov Prize For Writer's Civic Courage. Biography She was born in Kiev, USSR (present day Ukraine) in a Jewish family. Her father Pinchas Moritz, was imprisoned under Stalin, she suffered from tuberculosis in her childhood, and spent years of hardship in the Urals during World War II. In the 1950s, she went to study in Moscow, where she was briefly expelled from college for her poems' critical stance and alienation from the Soviet system. Her poem was a tribute to Titsian Tabidze, a Georgian poet executed by Stalin in 1937. In 1961, she became widely known for her collection about the Far North, The Cape of Desire, based on her journey aboard an Arctic icebreaker, and she was among the few young poets favored by Anna Akhmatova. Since the 1960s, she also became known for her poetic translations into Russian from many languages (these translations, commissioned by Soviet publishing houses, often employed an intermediary literal translator and a poet). She rendered into Russian verse such poets as Moisei Toif, Constantine Cavafy and Federico Garc√≠a Lorca. In later years, she attracted many young readers with her children poetry, some of which, like her adult work, became known to mass audience through songs created by guitar singer-songwriters, especially by Sergey Nikitin. Her other published work includes short stories, op-eds and, most recently, graphics. She has been founding member of several liberal organizations of artistic intelligentia, including the Russian section of International PEN. She is a member of Russian PEN Executive Committee and its Human Rights Commission. She has been awarded several prestigious prizes, including Andrei Sakharov Prize For Writer's Civic Courage.

His story is well known in Japan, and the best-known English translation first appeared in the book Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things by Lafcadio Hearn. A version of this story appears in the film Kwaidan, as well as the play The Dream of a Summer Day, which are both based on Hearn's work. The source text Hearn used has been identified as the work of , entitled \\"\\", in the series ', vol. 2, (pub. 1782). Â±±Âè£ÁúåÂ§ßÂ≠¶ÂÖ±Âêå„É™„Éù„Ç∏„Éà„É™ Legend summary According to legend, Hoichi was a blind minstrel (or biwa h≈çshi) with an amazing gift for the biwa (a loquat-shaped Japanese lute). He was particularly good at performing the Tale of the Heike, an epic describing the fall of Emperor Antoku, who is buried at Amidaji Temple. His performances were so wonderful that \\"even the goblins could not refrain from tears\\". Despite his talents, Hoichi was very poor and was forced to live at Amidaji Temple with a friendly priest. As the story goes, Hoichi was approached late one night by a gruff samurai who demanded that the minstrel play for his lord. The retainer led the blind Hoichi into what appeared to be the home of some powerful daimy≈ç, where a performance of the Tale of the Heike was requested. Hoichi's performance was met by high praise and moved his audience to tears, and he was asked to return the next evening for a follow-up recital. Before the retainer returned him to his temple, Hoichi was told that the nobleman for whom he had been playing was traveling incognito, and was warned not to speak of the evening's events. Play of Hoichi the Earless Kobe City Suma temple The following evening, the samurai returned to Hoichi's quarters and led him back to the nobleman. However, this time Hoichi's absence was discovered by his friend, the priest of Amidaji Temple. The priest grew suspicious and instructed his servants to look after Hoichi the next night. When they saw him leaving the temple the servants gave chase and eventually found Hoichi playing his biwa furiously in the middle of the Amidaji cemetery. When they dragged him back to the temple, Hoichi explained the previous night's events to the priest. Realizing that Hoichi had been bewitched by ghosts, the priest vowed to save his friend from further trickery. He painted Hoichi's body with the kanji characters of the Heart Sutra for protection and instructed him to remain silent and motionless when he is called upon by his ghostly audience. That evening the samurai called for Hoichi as before, and was angered when he received no response. The ghostly samurai approached Hoichi but was unable to see anything but his ears. The sutra had rendered the rest of Hoichi's body invisible. Attempting to comply with his orders, the samurai ripped Hoichi's ears off as proof that they had been the only portion of the lute player that was available. After the ghostly retainer had left, Hoichi was still too frightened to react, despite the blood gushing from the wounds on his head. When the priest returned, he realized in dismay that he had neglected to write the sutra on Hoichi's ears, which had left them vulnerable to the spirit. Despite his injury, Hoichi's ordeal had freed him from the spirit's power, and he went on to recover from his wounds and become a famous musician. Setting and variants The vintage text also names H≈çichi as the biwa strumming protagonist, and is set in Akama-seki, Ch≈çsh≈´, at the Buddhist temple named Amidaji (all as in Hearn's version). This locale is identifiable as today's Akama Shrine in Shimonoseki, Yamaguchi. A variant version collected by folklorists is called ,, p.89 taken down from Tokushima Prefecture (near Dannoura), and is mentioned by Kunio Yanagita in . Cultural references Hoichi is often referenced in the book Blood Ninja and Blood Ninja 2, as the character Shusaku's choice to paint himself in order to hide from other vampires is compared to the tale of Hoichi. In popular culture A fictionalized version of this tale serves as an episode of the 2003 series 100 Tales of Horror (ÊÄ™Ë´áÁôæÁâ©Ë™û, Kaidan Hyaku Monogatari). In the particular episode, Hoichi's background was revised as having been originally a foot-soldier of the Heike, tasked to guard one of their princesses--one he eventually kills due to being maltreated. Afterwards, he presents the princess's head to a Genji commander, who rebukes him for betraying his charge and eventually blinding him as punishment. As his atonement, he began to perform The Tale of the Heike. The storyline follows the original elements of the folktale‚Äîwith the twist being the ghostly court he performs to is eventually revealed to be his former Heike compatriots, and who finally takes his ears as a final act of spite before letting him go.

It is part of the Local Group and a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way galaxy. The Draco Dwarf is situated in the direction of the Draco Constellation at 34.6¬∞ above the galactic plane. Characteristics Paul W. Hodge analyzed the distribution of its stars in 1964 and concluded that its ellipticity was 0.29 ¬± 0.04. Recent studies have indicated that the galaxy may potentially hold large amounts of dark matter. Having an absolute magnitude of -8.6 and a total luminosity of only , it is one of the faintest companions to our Milky Way. Draco Dwarf contains many red giant branch (RGB) stars; five carbon stars have been identified in Draco Dwarf and four likely asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars have been detected. The Draco Dwarf is estimated to be 80 ¬± 10 kpc from Earth and span a distance of 830 ¬± 100 √ó 570 ¬± 70 pc. RR Lyrae In 1961, Walter Baade and Henrietta H. Swope studied Draco Dwarf and discovered over 260 variables, of the 138 in the cluster's center, all but five were determined to be RR Lyrae variables. From this work a RR Lyrae derived distance modulus of 19.55 is found which implies a distance of 81 kpc. Metallicity The Draco Dwarf contains primarily an old population of stars and insignificant amounts of interstellar matter (being basically dust free). From 75% to 90% of its stars formed more than ~10 Gyr ago followed by a low rate of formation with a small burst of star formation around 2-3 Gyr ago. It has a single Gaussian distribution with average metallicity of [Fe/H] = ‚àí1.74 dex with a standard deviation (sigma/œÉ) of 0.24 dex and a small tail of metal-rich stars. The central region of Draco Dwarf exhibits a concentration of more metal-rich stars there being more centrally concentrated red horizontal branch stars than blue horizontal branch stars. Dark matter Recently, dwarf spheroidal galaxies have become key objects for the study of dark matter. The Draco Dwarf is one which has received specific attention. Radial velocity computations of Draco have revealed a large internal velocity dispersion giving a mass to luminosity ratio of up to /, suggesting large amounts of dark matter. It has been hypothesized that large velocity dispersions could be explained as tidal dwarfs (virtually unbound stellar streams from dwarf galaxies tidally disrupted in the Milky Way potential). However, Draco Dwarf's narrow horizontal branch width does not support this model. This only leaves the dark matter explanation and makes Draco Dwarf the most dark matter dominated object known as of 2007. The dark matter distribution within Draco Dwarf is at least nearly isothermal. At large radii, radial velocity dispersion exhibit strange behavior. One possible explanation for this would be the presence of more than one stellar population. This suggests the need for further study of Draco Dwarf population's metallicity and ages and of dwarf spheroidals in general. Notes 1. Assuming an absolute magnitude of +0.5 V for RR Lyrae the apparent modulus of the Draco Dwarf is 19.58 m - M. Using a reddening value towards Draco Dwarf of 0.03 ¬± 0.01 we get a true distance modulus of 19.55. 2. Using the distance modulus formula of 1 we get an RR Lyrae estimated distance of 81 kpc. 3.

They lived in Skiritis, a mountainous region located in northern Laconia on the border with Arcadia, between the Oenus and the Eurotas rivers. According to Stephanus of Byzantium and Hesychius of Alexandria, the Sciritae were of Arcadian origin. Their way of life was essentially rural: they mostly lived in villages, of which the biggest were Oion and Caryai. Their territory was inhospitable, but was of strategic importance for Sparta since it controlled the road to Tegea, which explains why it rapidly fell in Spartan hands. Their status was similar to that of the Perioeci, but Xenophon distinguished between them, writing, 'To meet the case of a hostile approach at night, he assigned the duty of acting as sentries outside the lines to the Sciritae. In these days the duty is shared by foreigners, if any happen to be present in the camp.' Xenophon, Constitution of the Lacedaimonians 12.3 In war the Sciritae formed an elite corps of light infantry, a lochos (battalion) of about 600 men, which were used as a complement to the civic army. According to Thucydides (v. 67), they fought on the extreme-left wing in the battle-line, the most threatening position for the hoplite phalanx: \\"In this battle the left wing was composed of the Sciritae, who in a Lacedaemonian army have always that post to themselves alone\\". At night, they were placed as sentinels ahead of the army (Xenophon, Constitution of the Spartans, xii. 3) and acted as scouts to open the way for the king, whom they only could precede. In the Cyropaedia (IV, 2), Xenophon compares them to the Hyrcanian cavalry, used by the Assyrians as rear-guard.

The Nahanni Range Road proper is entirely gravel, and is not recommended for general public use. Originally, two-thirds of the route was maintained by the Yukon government, and had campgrounds for public use. The remaining third was maintained by the mining company, open to public traffic, but with no public facilities at the town. When the mine shut in 1986, the road fell into disuse and maintenance became increasingly difficult. Since the mine resumed intermittent production in 2003, the road has been restored for the use of the mining company, but general public travel is still not advised.

He pitched from 1959‚Äì1975 for four teams. During a 17-year baseball career, Perry compiled 215 wins, 1,576 strikeouts, and a 3.45 earned run average. Career He was born in Williamston, North Carolina and attended Campbell University until being signed by the Indians in 1956. He is the older brother of Hall of Fame pitcher Gaylord Perry. The Perry brothers trail only the Niekro brothers (Phil and Joe) for career victories by brothers. In 1959, Jim Perry came in 2nd to Bob Allison in the Rookie of the Year vote. Perry followed up with an 18-win season in 1960. Perry was a three- time All-Star and won the 1970 AL Cy Young Award, when he posted a record of 24-12. Jim and Gaylord Perry are the only brothers in Major League history to win Cy Young Awards. He also won 20 games in 1969, and won at least 17 games five times. As a batter, Perry was a switch-hitter and posted a respectable .199 batting average with 5 home runs and 59 RBI in his career. On July 3, 1973, brothers Gaylord Perry (Indians) and Jim Perry (Tigers) pitched against each other for the only regular season game in their careers. Neither finished the game, but Gaylord was charged with the 5‚Äì4 loss. Two Norm Cash home runs helped Detroit. He is currently tied with Stan Coveleski for 84th on the all- time win list. Retirement Following his final year with Oakland, Perry retired to his North Carolina home where he keeps busy with charitable events, especially golf tournaments. His son, Chris, is a professional golfer who has won a tournament on the PGA Tour. On June 11, 2011, Perry was inducted into the Twins Hall of Fame in a ceremony prior to a Twins home game and attended by current members including Rod Carew, Bert Blyleven, Rick Aguilera, Gary Gaetti, Tom Kelly, Jim Rantz, and Tony Oliva. On November 11, 2012, Campbell University announced that their renovated baseball stadium would be re-named Jim Perry Stadium. Perry attended Campbell University from 1956 to 1959.

Parallel play is a form of play in which children play adjacent to each other, but do not try to influence one another's behavior. Children usually play alone during parallel play but are interested in what other children are doing. This usually occurs after the first birthday.Kail, R.V., & Cavaunaugh, J.C. (2007) Human Development: A Life-Span View (5th ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning. It usually involves two or more children in the same room who are interested in the same toy, each seeing the toy as their own. The children do not play together, but alongside each other simply because they are in the same room. Parallel play is usually first observed in children aged 2‚Äì3. An observer will notice that the children occasionally see what the others are doing and then modify their play accordingly. The older the children are, the less frequently they engage in this type of play. However, even older preschool children engage in parallel play, an enduring and frequent activity over the preschool years. The image of parallel play is two children playing side by side in a sandbox, each absorbed in his or her game, not interacting with the other. \\"This is considered an early stage in child development, characterized by egocentric behavior and the inability to decenter and coordinate with the activities of a 'playmate'\\". In education, parallel play also describes activities where students are divided into pairs or small groups and work on the same activity simultaneously. This gives all students equal opportunity for active involvement and reduces exposure ‚Äì since all students are playing, none are watching.\\" This stage ends when a child develops the ability to engage in interactive play behavior and symbolic communication.  History  Mildred Parten was one of the first to study peer sociability among 2 to 5-year-olds in 1932. Parten noticed a dramatic rise of interactive play with age and concluded that social development includes three stages. Parallel play is the first of three stages of play observed in young children. The other two stages include simple social play (playing and sharing together), and finally cooperative play (different complementary roles; shared purpose). The research by Parten indicated that preschool children prefer groups of two, parallel play was less likely with age, a majority of the kids chose playmates of the same sex and sand play along with constructive work were the most common parallel play activities. Other findings in her study showed that I.Q. level had little impact, siblings preferred to play with each other, home environment was a big factor and playing house was the most common form of social play among children. Research indicates that these forms of play emerge in the order suggested by Parten, but they do not form a developmental sequence in which later-appearing ones replace earlier ones. All types coexist during the preschool years. Vygotsky believed that play during childhood created a zone of proximal development of the child and guided in intellectual development. Socioeconomic status appeared to only impact associative play, where British children who were used in the study of low socioeconomic status preferred that type of play. This could be explained due to the fact that those kids had fewer toys and more siblings to share toys with.  Developing skills  Parallel play helps children begin language development and create social relationships. \\"Rubin et al.(1976) have suggested that those who play beside others may desire the company of other children but may not yet have the skills required to play in an associative or cooperative manner\\". It can also assist with gross and fine motor skills, through the child's own individualized play. Parallel play can increase confidence because children are learning to play near others. Children can observe one another and learn to use new skills from playing alongside others. Eventually, it will lead to social development where the child will form relationships with others during play. Parallel play can be useful in encouraging expression of a child's feelings through their own individualized play. The child will increasingly learn to share and become aware of others emotions, as well as learn cause and effect through trial and error of adjusting and solving problems in play. \\"Parallel play is often viewed as characteristics of a ‚Äústage‚Äù through which children pass as they develop from solitary players to social players\\". Children will undergo different playing stages in order to finally join people in groups. Analysis published in 2003 in Early Childhood Research Quarterly showed that preschool children, who enjoy watching others engage in parallel play, can have future activities designed to help with transition into higher levels of social interaction. The parallel-play activities can help neglected or rejected children with social transition between social-play states. Smith believed parallel play to be optional and not \\"After Parallel play, children were most likely to be found in either Together or Group Play\\". This suggests that parallel play played an important role to this transition. According to a study performed by Wei Peng and Julia Crouse, parallel play can be used to design games, especially active video games that involve physical activity, to be more effective. Playing with other people, even if those individuals are strangers, was more motivational than playing alone and there does not appear to be a major difference in cooperation and competition between same physical space mode and separated physical-space mode. Also playing with others or online creates an ability to relate to others and parallel competition in separated space is more enjoyable, more physically exerting and creates higher future play motivation. Children cope differently depending on how they were raised, this also applies to how they cope with unfamiliar beings in their lives. Jens B. Asendorpf refers to parallel play as a child's coping style, and explains that children who want to play with an unfamiliar peer will resort to this style. This coping style allows children to engage in the same activities as their peers from afar, until they are comfortable enough to socialize with their peers.  References  .

It is a small corps, forming part of the Army Medical Services. History A sergeant of the RAVC bandages the wounded ear of a mine-detecting dog at Bayeux in Normandy, 5 July 1944 The Army Veterinary Service was founded in 1796 after public outrage concerning the death of Army horses. Prior to this date, the management and care of army horses had been left to each individual regiment's Quartermaster, who (using government-contracted farriers) inspected animals on the march and saw to shoeing, stabling and other routine matters. Individual cavalry officers were expected to acquire a knowledge of 'the diseases which horses are subject to, and the medicines proper to be applied'. In 1795 a veterinary surgeon, William Stockley, was appointed on a trial basis for six months to the 1st Fencible Cavalry Regiment. The experiment was a success, and in April the following year a Board of Cavalry Officers recommended that a veterinary surgeon should be attached to each regiment of cavalry, agreeing to defray the costs of three years' training for up to six men per year at the recently-established Veterinary College of London. At the same time, Edward Coleman, Principal of the Veterinary College, was appointed 'Principal Veterinary Surgeon to the Cavalry and Veterinary Surgeon to the Board of Ordnance'. With regard to the cavalry, his duties were to recommend veterinary surgeons for regimental appointments, and to inspect the horses of regiments 'when ordered to do so by the Commander-in-Chief or by the commanding Officers'. He was also contracted to supply 'Horse Medicines', and, as Principal of the College, was closely involved in the process of veterinary training and in keeping surgeons abreast of new developments. With regard to the Board of Ordnance, he was in attendance at Woolwich (where the military establishment of the Ordnance was based) once a week, to give professional assistance in the purchase of artillery horses, advice to the resident veterinary surgeon in 'extraordinary cases', and instructions to farriers on shoeing. It was on his advice that some stables at Woolwich were set aside to serve as a hospital, and he appointed John Percivall as his assistant to reside there. Veterinary support was required without delay for horses engaged in the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars, so Coleman initially dispensed with the three-year training requirement and instead recruited medically qualified personnel, who were offered three months' additional veterinary training. As such, John Shipp was the first veterinary surgeon to be commissioned into the British Army when he joined the 11th Light Dragoons on 25 June 1796. Sixteen veterinary surgeons were appointed the following year, and by 1801 there were 44 in total. At this time, rather than forming their own autonomous department or corps, each veterinary surgeon was recruited directly into a regiment and formed part of the regimental staff under the authority of its colonel. As well as to cavalry regiments, veterinary surgeons were appointed to other units, such as the Royal Artillery and the Royal Waggon Train. In 1805 a sizeable Veterinary Establishment was opened on Woolwich Common to see to the equine needs of the Royal Artillery (whose Barracks were nearby). Later known as the Royal Horse Infirmary, it went on to function as a hospital, veterinary store and centre of veterinary research. John Percivall was provided with quarters there; and in 1816 he took over as Senior Veterinary Surgeon of the Ordnance from Edward Coleman (the latter remaining P.V.S. to the Army until his death more than 20 years later). In the years that followed the terms of service of military veterinary surgeons was put on a sounder footing, and systems and regulations were drawn up for the performance of their duties. By the mid-1850s there were sixty-four serving veterinary surgeons, of whom forty-three went with their units to the war in Crimea; however, as with the other military support services involved, lack of co-ordination and proper facilities severely hampered their work and led to criticism. As a result of the war, the Board of Ordnance was abolished and the Army's veterinary service reconfigured. =Army Veterinary Department= The Board of Ordnance (which was separate from the Army and included the Royal Artillery and the Royal Engineers as part of its establishment) had always maintained its own veterinary service; but following the abolition of the Board and the transfer of its troops to the Army, the separate veterinary services were brought together under a single Principal Veterinary Surgeon (P.V.S.) in 1859. That year, all Army Veterinary Surgeons were listed together for the first time in the official Army List, under the heading 'Veterinary Medical Department' (the word 'Medical' being dropped two years later). It was, however, a department more in name than in practice, since veterinary surgeons once appointed still remained attached to a regiment and answerable to its colonel. The Royal Horse Infirmary, Woolwich became the de facto headquarters of the Department: the Principal Veterinary Surgeon was based (and housed) there, and newly-commissioned officers attended there to receive instruction. As well as the Royal Field Artillery and the Royal Horse Artillery (both of which used large numbers of horses), the Horse Transport Branch of the Army Service Corps was based in Woolwich, which provided the Army's main land transport capability. In the 1860s an attempt was made to codify operational arrangements for the Army Veterinary Service in wartime, with provision being made for the first time for the treatment of sick and injured animals at field depots. In 1876, James Collins was appointed Principal Veterinary Surgeon; the role was now considered part of the War Office Staff, and he was based in Pall Mall rather than Woolwich. Collins lobbied for surgeons to be fully organised on a departmental basis. He had a degree of success: in 1878 the regimental system of veterinary care was abolished except for the cavalry. From the following year, under a newly- centralised Army Veterinary Service, a general list of non-regimental veterinary officers was available to any unit. Then, in 1881, a fully-unified Army Veterinary Department came into being when abolition of the regimental system of veterinary care was extended to all cavalry units (with the exception of the Household Cavalry, where a regimental veterinary surgeon is retained to this day). James Collins also played a key role in establishing the Army Veterinary School in Aldershot in 1880. Initially established in the Infirmary Stables alongside one of the cavalry barracks, it instructed army officers in the care of animals, basic veterinary first aid and the selection of remounts, while at the same time instructing army veterinary surgeons in military duties and veterinary knowledge relevant to particular combat situations (including tropical diseases, which were prevalent among army animals at the time). In 1890 there were reported to be 3,312 army horses in Aldershot Camp: 1,814 belonging to cavalry regiments, 750 to the Royal Artillery (312 riding and 438 draught horses), 397 horses (and mules) pertaining to the Army Service Corps, and 262 to the Royal Engineers (the rest being attached to officers of the infantry regiments). In 1899 the School moved into more permanent premises, later known as Fitzwygram House. In 1887 a separate Army Remount Service was established (responsible for supplying the army with replacement horses and mules). Against veterinary advice, the decision was taken in 1898 to remove provision for sick and injured animals from the war establishment, and to merge provision of field veterinary hospitals with that of field remount depots, with the result that, in the Second Boer War, disease spread rapidly and unchecked: 326,000 horses and 51,000 mules died in the conflict, very few as a result of enemy action. Faced with stringent criticism, the government established a committee of inquiry to make recommendations as to the improvement of army veterinary services. The committee reported in 1903, recommending among other things a comprehensive restructuring of the Department. =Army Veterinary Corps= The Army Veterinary Corps on the Western Front, 1914-1918. The Army Veterinary Department consisted only of officers; no provision was made for trained subordinate staff, a situation that began to be remedied by the formation in 1903 of an Army Veterinary Corps into which other ranks were drafted. Three years later the Corps amalgamated with the Department to form a single unit (the Army Veterinary Corps) of officers, NCOs and men. The 1903 report had also recommended the building of new veterinary hospitals, first in Woolwich and Aldershot, and then in Bulford and Curragh, each staffed by an AVC unit. (This was met with resistance from senior cavalry officers, who resisted the encroachment on their regiments of establishments which were not under their command.) Woolwich was designated as the Corps Depot; a large mobilization and reserve store was built there alongside the new hospital. At Aldershot the old infirmary stables were extended to form the new hospital, with new accommodation for sixty horses provided, plus an isolation ward and an operating theatre; it was completed in 1910. During World War I temporary wooden stables were added to provide space for over a thousand animals. During the First World War almost half the veterinary surgeons in Britain served as officers in the AVC, and the number of other ranks in the Corps grew from 934 to 41,755. Innovations included provision of Mobile Veterinary Sections, to transfer sick and wounded horses to veterinary hospitals, and camel specialists, who staffed hospital facilities in Egypt. As well as serving on the Western Front, the AVC was deployed with animals to such contrasting theatres of war as Gallipoli, Salonika, Mesopotamia and Palestine. =Royal Army Veterinary Corps= Convalescent horses at the RAVC hospital at Tidworth Camp, Wiltshire, in the Second World War In 1918 the Corps was given its Royal prefix in recognition of its service through the First World War. At the time the Quartermaster-General wrote: > The Corps by its initiative and scientific methods has placed military > veterinary organisation on a higher plane. The high standard which it has > maintained at home and throughout all theatres has resulted in a reduction > of animal wastage, an increased mobility of mounted units and a mitigation > of animal suffering un-approached in any previous military operation. Demobilisation after the war was followed by mechanisation, and consequentially the RAVC was greatly reduced in size. 1938 saw the closure of the Army Veterinary School in Aldershot. Nevertheless, animals would still be required by the army, especially where there was rough terrain or other conditions with which motor vehicles struggled to cope. During World War II the strength of the Corps increased from 85 officers and 105 other ranks, to a total of 519 officers and 3,939 other ranks. By 1942 the Army had 6,500 horses, 10,000 mules and 1,700 camels in service. That year the work of the Army Remount Service was taken over by the RAVC; in Italy, there was a high incidence of battle casualties among mules (used in large numbers for transport due to the difficult terrain) and the Corps was engaged in their procurement as well as their treatment. In 1939, the Corps Depot had moved from Woolwich as a wartime precaution (the area being prone to aerial bombardment); as No.1 Reserve Veterinary Hospital, Depot and Training Establishment it occupied Doncaster Racecourse for the duration of the war, before relocating to Melton Mowbray (where there was a Remount depot) in February 1946. During the war the Army Veterinary and Remount Services took on responsibility for providing the army with dogs. In the years since the Second World War, dogs have become the main animal to be engaged in combat situations. Function A RAVC Officer checks the health of local livestock, Afghanistan 2011. Officer of the RAVC accompanying the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery at a ceremonial event. The RAVC provides, trains and cares for mainly dogs and horses, but also tends to the various regimental mascots in the army, which range from goats to an antelope. Personnel include veterinary surgeons and veterinary technicians providing medical and surgical care to animals, and handlers who train dogs and deploy with them on operational service. Dogs are used extensively in the theatre of war, and are organised within the 1st Military Working Dog Regiment (see below). Horses are used primarily for ceremonial purposes, although the Corps continues to rehearse procedures for the operational deployment of horses.

In February 2010, Treo, a black Labrador- Spaniel crossbreed, was awarded the Dickin Medal for services in Afghanistan. In 2011 Lance Corporal Liam Tasker of 104 MWD Squadron was killed in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. He was posthumously mentioned in despatches. His Arms Explosive search dog, Theo, died shortly afterwards. Theo was posthumously awarded the Dickin Medal on 25 October 2012. Memorials RAVC Memorial, National Memorial Arboretum A memorial to the RAVC and its predecessors was unveiled at the National Memorial Arboretum on 2 May 2014 by the Princess Royal. Seven memorial stones in remembrance of the five dog handlers who lost their lives while serving in Northern Ireland and the two dog handlers who were killed while on operations in Afghanistan have been placed at their base in North Luffenham. Built heritage In late March 2016, the Ministry of Defence announced that Fitzwygram House in Aldershot (also known as the Royal Army Veterinary Centre), was one of ten sites that would be sold in order to reduce the size of the Defence estate. Built in 1899 for the Army Veterinary School, the building contained a library, laboratories, teaching and demonstration rooms (which remained in use after the closure of the School). It contains a plaque which reads: > This school was founded through the representations of James Collins esq, > Principal Veterinary Surgeon to the forces and Major General Sir Frederick > Fitzwygram, Bart FRCVS commanding the Cavalry Brigade, Aldershot, 1st June > 1880. While the house itself is due to be converted for civilian use, the stable complex behind it was scheduled to be demolished. This (a surviving combination of mid-19th century cavalry infirmary stables and early twentieth century sick boxes, operating room and pharmacy) was used as a First World War horse hospital, and has been described as providing 'a unique archaeological record of that period of military veterinary history'.

Subsequent Tekken games feature an upgraded model with a slightly different name, with the exception of Tekken 4, in which he makes no appearance. Appearances=In video games= The various Jack models were originally created by the Mishima Zaibatsu and G Corporation for different purposes: *Jack (introduced in Tekken) is the original model, created by Heihachi's Mishima Zaibatsu in order to counter a coup from Kazuya Mishima in the King of Iron Fist Tournament. In-game, the player is one of these machines. *Jack-2 (introduced in Tekken 2) is a direct upgrade of the Jack model, also created by the Mishima Zaibatsu. Once Jack witnesses a young girl named Jane lose her mother during a battle, he takes it upon himself to look after her, until he is destroyed by Dr. Abel. *Prototype Jack (or P. Jack) (introduced in Tekken) is a prototype created to combat both Jack and Jack-2. After the first King of Iron Fist Tournament, the remains of Prototype Jack are almost destroyed by Jack's combat abilities. His body is later remodeled by Dr. Bosconovitch and goes on to combat Jack-2. P. Jack is seemingly destroyed by Jack-2 in the second tournament. This is the only Jack to appear in more than three games, appearing in the original Tekken, Tekken 2, Tekken Tag Tournament, and the console version of Tekken Tag Tournament 2. *Gun Jack (introduced in Tekken 3) is a more advanced prototype, created by Jane in an attempt to revive her friend, Jack-2. While she is successful in implanting Jack-2's memories inside him, he is destroyed by gunfire by the Tekken Force when he and Jane attempt to break into the Mishima Zaibatsu labs. *Jack-4 (introduced in Tekken 5) is an upgrade of Gun Jack, created by G Corporation and the only one in the Jack series that is non-playable. Like P. Jack, this model has a separate personality. Unlike other models in the Jack series, this one is mass-produced to serve as the foot soldiers of the G Corporation. While these never participate in any tournament, they are sent by G Corporation to kill Kazuya Mishima after they no longer need him, and the subsequent battle in Hon-Maru almost results in the death of Heihachi Mishima. These specific models have a self-destruct device embedded in them, indicated when one of them peels away its face to reveal a countdown. They also appear as enemies in the Scenario Campaign mode in Tekken 6. *Jack-5 (introduced in Tekken 5) is an upgrade of Jack-4, created by Jane to participate in the King of Iron Fist Tournament 5. Currently upgraded into Jack-6 after Kazuya's take over. *Jack-6 (introduced in Tekken 6) is an upgrade of Jack-5, upgraded from Jack-5 with same model of previous version by G Corporation with the mission of destroying the Mishima Zaibatsu in the King of Iron Fist Tournament 6. *Jack-X (introduced in Street Fighter X Tekken) and his official tag partner, Bryan Fury were released on July 31, 2012, as downloadable content.http://www.joystiq.com/2012/07/07/street-fighter-x-tekken-dlc- adds-12-new-characters-july-31/ Unlike Jack-5 ‚Äì 6, this Jack can talk, although it was revealed to be in prototype stage between both of these main Jack series. *Jack-7 (introduced in Tekken 7) is an upgrade of Jack-6. It finally has a model modification since it was ended with Jack-5. The Jack series robots also appear in Tekken Tag Tournament (Jack-2, Gun Jack, and Prototype Jack) and Tekken Tag Tournament 2 (Jack-6 and Prototype Jack). In- game, the Jacks have traditionally shared a number of their moves with Kuma/Panda and Ganryu. In Tekken 5, however, Namco made a pronounced effort to differentiate all the shared moves between characters: the fighters still have a few similar moves, but their executions are completely different. In Tekken 5, Jack-5 is considered one of the most difficult characters to play. Inversely, in Tekken 6, Jack-6 is considered one of the easiest characters to learn. =In other media= Jack-2 appears in Tekken: The Motion Picture as a main character, with slight modifications to his Tekken 2 storyline. This time, he is in search of a cure for Jane's illness. Jack-6's dossier is briefly seen in the CGI film Tekken: Blood Vengeance when Anna Williams opens a file containing dossiers on various persons of interest. Reception GameDaily ranked Jack as the 24th top video game robot, stating, \\"While not the most popular character in the Tekken series, Jack punched its way to become a worthy opponent\\". Jack was featured on a list of the best video game robots by Now Gamer, placing him second out of 10, and adding \\"He's like the Terminator, if Drago-era Dolph Lundgren played the Terminator instead of that other guy\\" and ranking him at number 7. UGO Networks featured him in the article \\"We Love These Video Game Robots Even Though They Can't Love Back\\". PopCrunch ranked Jack ninth on their list of the best AI characters in video games. GamesRadar mentioned him in the \\"Robots that don't make any sense\\" article, questioning \\"Another Jack? Is that a popular robot name?\\". In GamesRadar article for Street Fighter X Tekken, they stated \\"Jack-X seems to be one of the newest models in the series, the buff robot sometimes works for the Mishimas, other times he competes to learn something about himself.\\" Complex compared Jack and Yoshimitsu to Seth and Cycloid-Y from the Street Fighter series, predicting the former two would win in a fight. In 2012, Complex also listed Prototype Jack as the 15th coolest robot in video games. Gaming Target listed Jack as the ninth best Tekken character. GameSpy named Jack as one of the \\"25 Extremely Rough Brawlers\\" in video gaming, commenting \\"Featuring massive metal arms that are as big as its entire body, Jack simply and unemotionally crushes the competition.\\" PlayStation Official Magazine listed Jack as one of \\"The best PlayStation robots,\\" stating, \\"the reason we like Jack, all the Jacks, is their simplicity. They are massive and can batter people around the face with swooping mechanized doom fists\\".

History Inverness railway panorama in 1948 Inverness station was opened on 5 November 1855Butt (1995) as the western terminus of the Inverness and Nairn Railway to designs by the architect, Joseph Mitchell.The Buildings of Scotland, Highland and Islands. John Gifford. Yale University Press. 1992. The station originally comprised a single covered passenger platform with three lines of rails, one for arrivals, one for departures and a spare line for carriages. In 1857 the railway company erected a clock in front of the station facing Academy Street. This clock by Bryson & Sons, Princes Street, Edinburgh, was illuminated at night. In 1865 the station was enlarged. The platform was lengthened to and a shed added which was long, wide and high. There were double lines for north and south traffic. The platforms were extended again to and the platform roofs were extended in 1876 by Murdoch Paterson. The station platforms were lit by electricity for the first time in 1908. The station layout in 1902 In 1933, as part of an internal reorganization, the London and North Eastern Railway closed their offices at the station and the staff relocated to Aberdeen. Between 1966 and 1968 under British Rail the station buildings were replaced, the new design by Thomas Munro and Company. It is now the terminus of the Highland Main Line, the Aberdeen‚ÄìInverness line (of which the Inverness and Nairn Railway is now a part), the Kyle of Lochalsh line and the Far North Line. A revamp by Mott Macdonald of the station's frontage, forecourt and concourse was planned to be completed by 2018. However this was delayed. The nearby Royal Highland Hotel refused to give up their lease of parking spaces in front of the station. =Stationmasters= *G.H.

Caledonian Sleeper and London North Eastern Railway run the only non- ScotRail services. The station itself sits at one apex of a triangular junction in the centre of Inverness, with each half of the station connected to one line. The Highland Main and Aberdeen Lines both approach the station from the east and use Platforms 1‚Äì4, while the Far North Line (which also carries traffic heading for the Kyle Line) approach from the north-west and use Platforms 5‚Äì7. Platform 5 also has a connection from the east side, but it is only usable by a two car train, and even then, it must not be in passenger service and movements from Platform 5 to the east line are not allowed. Platform 1 is long enough for a 13-coach train; platform 2 can hold 15 coaches; platforms 3 and 4, eight each; and platforms 5‚Äì7 will accommodate five coaches each. The third chord runs between Rose Street Junction on the Far North Line and Welsh's Bridge Junction on the Aberdeen/Perth line. The Aberdeen and Perth lines diverge at Millburn Junction a short distance beyond Welsh's Bridge. Platforms 1‚Äì4 are from (measured via ); Millburn Junction, from Perth, is also from Perth (measured via ). The station is the zero point for the Far North Line, and platforms 5‚Äì7 are along this line; Rose Street Junction, along the Far North Line, is from Perth. Signalling for the entire area is controlled from a panel box near the station built in 1988. This supervises the station area & approaches and also houses the Radio Electronic Token Block (RETB) control desk that monitors the full length of the Kyle & Far North lines. RETB was installed by British Rail. Platform destination LED screens are installed, along with a main departures and arrivals information board. Each of Platforms 1-7 has its own screen showing departures from that platform. Screens are also present behind the wall for all platforms from 3‚Äì6. In addition, several other screens are also visible for general information. In early 2020, a massive reconstruction project was announced, which included the neighbouring Sports Direct and TK Maxx stores being purchased as well as the former Royal Mail sorting office and car park. It is part of a plan to majorly reduce CO2 emissions in the City Centre, with this, the ability to have electric trains running to the station suggested electrification of lines north of the central belt. It was also announced that it would have fuelling for hydrogen vehicles as well as e-bike stations.

Many services can also be joined at the stop on Millburn Road outside Marks and Spencer, closer to the station. Aside from local buses, there are also long-distance coach services which allow rail passengers to continue their journey to areas of the Highlands not on the rail network: *Scottish Citylink route 961 operates two daily return services to Ullapool to connect with Caledonian MacBrayne ferry sailings to Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis.

Kuma I was introduced in the first Tekken and returned for Tekken 2, while Kuma II was introduced in Tekken 3 and has returned for all subsequent games. Both of them are tame bears, bodyguards to Heihachi Mishima, as well as father and son towards each other. The female was introduced in Tekken 3 as a palette swap of Kuma, returning for subsequent games. Kuma=Tekken series= The first Kuma was once an abandoned cub in the forests of the Mishima estate. Heihachi Mishima found Kuma and took him in as his pet. When Kuma reached adulthood, Heihachi built him an outhouse to cater for his impressively large frame. Heihachi taught the bear simple commands and hand signals, which Kuma picked up at an alarming speed. Kuma was even taught rudimentary Japanese. After two years, Heihachi realized the power contained in Kuma, and so he trained Kuma in the arts of Kuma Shinken. None of Heihachi's associates could understand why Kuma was so intelligent, which led to a lot of them fleeing the estate in fear of the bear's intellect. This was further reinforced by Kuma's penchant for the taste of human flesh. Despite Kuma's unflinching loyalty to his master, Kuma liked to leave the side of Heihachi to sleep, even during the summer. This lazy approach means that Kuma's fighting style has never really matured and is very disjointed. This was demonstrated in The King of Iron Fist Tournament, where Kuma was easily defeated by Paul Phoenix. Kuma was very impressed with Paul's fighting prowess, as he thought that the only strong human was Heihachi. Heihachi was defeated in the last tournament by Kazuya Mishima, and so the two retreated into a mountain dojo to re-train. Kuma traveled to the King of Iron Fist Tournament 2 with his master, vowing to destroy Paul Phoenix this time. If anyone gets in his way, he would eat them. He was defeated by Paul again. During Kuma's travels with Heihachi, Kuma died of old age. Before he died, he had a cub, which was also named Kuma by Heihachi, perhaps in homage of beloved first pet. Eventually, Kuma II became Heihachi's pet, and Heihachi trained him in Kuma Shinken, as he did Kuma II's father years ago. Kuma II is more intelligent than his father, but is also lazier. One day, while he was immersed in a television show, Kuma suddenly went wild at the sight of a martial artist with a scarlet go-gi. The fighter was the original Kuma's old rival, Paul Phoenix. Since that day, Kuma trained intensely in order to defeat Paul in battle. Not interested in defeating Ogre, the fighting God, Kuma enters The King of Iron Fist Tournament 3 with the sole intention of defeating Paul Phoenix. During the previous tournament, Kuma lost to Paul Phoenix. Kuma realized that he had lost touch with his animal roots, and that as long as he remained Heihachi's pet, he would be restricted in harnessing the power of his natural power and instincts. Determined to revive his animal instincts, Kuma began training in the mountains of Hokkaido, and for the first time in his life, he trained alone, without Heihachi. While training, Kuma found life in the wilderness more intense than anything Kuma went through with Heihachi. Despite this, Kuma continued his training, and felt his skills improving, and even developing his own attacks. Although he had made some massive strides in his life to revive his animal instincts, Kuma kept one quirk - he could not live without television. He would frequently go down to nearby villages to watch TV through the windows of the villagers' houses. One day, Kuma went down to the villages to watch some TV, as per usual, but when he looked through the window of one house, he saw a commercial announcing The King of Iron Fist Tournament 4. With his animal instincts raging, Kuma headed to the tournament, once again, with the sole intention of defeating Paul Phoenix. Kuma finally defeated Paul in the King of Iron Fist Tournament 4. However, his master Heihachi was dead. Kuma was alone without Heihachi. Then he realized the Mishima Zaibatsu was in trouble he knew what he must do. When Kuma reached headquarters, he heard someone was taken control and announced the King of Iron Fist Tournament 5. Kuma vows revenge to save the Zaibatsu for his master and enters the King of Iron Fist Tournament, but he was defeated by Paul. After the death of his former master, Heihachi Mishima, Kuma believed no one but he could rescue the Mishima Financial Group (MFG) from its captor. Eager to do just that, Kuma confronted the MFG. However, the MFG's new CEO, Jin Kazama, was waiting. Kuma was easily beaten and discarded in the Hokkaid≈ç wilderness. Though defeated, his fighting spirit was not lost and he found his former master Heihachi, whereas both reclaimed the MFG and Kuma is promoted as one of Tekken Force officer as of The King of Iron Fist Tournament 7. Kuma is also the one who inspired a Philippine fighter Josie Rizal when Kuma and his troops helps the victims of her country's Typhoon incident. Kuma also appears in Tekken Card Challenge, Tekken Tag Tournament, Tekken 3D: Prime Edition, Tekken Tag Tournament 2 and Tekken Revolution. =Other games= Kuma appears in Capcom-made crossover fighting game Street Fighter X Tekken with Heihachi Mishima as his official partner. His Swap Costume is modeled after R. Mika. According to the download blurb, Kuma has joined R. Mika's wrestling league. Apparently this was the only costume that could fit him. Kuma appears as a support character in PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale. He is summoned by Heihachi Mishima's level 2 Super, where he runs around the stage slashing at fighters with his claws, pounds the ground and despawns. He also appears as a minion, and can be unlocked by reaching rank 8 with Heihachi. Kuma also appears in Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory and its remake as a NPC that appears on some of the events of the DLC character, Tekken. Kuma however never uses actual bear sounds in his appearance in Victory, but is rather voiced by Tekken director, Katsuhiro Harada. He was described as Tekken's sparring partner and close friend. =In other media= Kuma I made a cameo in Tekken: The Motion Picture, climbing down a tree. Kuma appears in comics Tekken Saga (1997), Tekken 2 (1998) and Tekken Forever (2003). A picture of Kuma II is briefly seen in the CGI film Tekken: Blood Vengeance, when Anna Williams recruits Ling Xiaoyu at Mishima Polytechnic School. Character design In Tekken, Kuma I was represented as a sun bear; however in Tekken 2, Kuma is either a grizzly bear or a polar bear, depending on which costume is used. Kuma II is always depicted as a large, grizzly bear with brown fur. He almost always wears a red scarf and red spiked wristband on the left hand. In Tekken 4, however, he wears red T-shirt with a design on the back and red-white paw rubber shoes. Later, he also gains red spiked anklet on the left leg instead of red wristband. Kuma fights using an \\"original\\" fighting style called Kuma Shinken, a move set closely resembling Mishima family's style of karate. In the earlier games, Kuma Shinken took many elements from the Jack models' fighting style. However, in later games, the art started to gain some originality with unique strikes and even a \\"hunting\\" mode which puts Kuma on all fours for more attacks. This fighting style is considered one of the most unusual, as it does not rely on straight attacks, but instead uses tricks such as rolls, dodges, and various other stances. Because of this, Kuma is one of the hardest characters to master, as he is quite slow and not very flexible. Kuma also has move where he turns around, stands on all fours, relaxes, and then farts, which would instant kill the opponent. Reception GameSpy named Kuma as one of the \\"25 Extremely Rough Brawlers\\" in video gaming, commenting \\"This one is simple ‚Äì Kuma is a bear. An actual bear. A wild animal.\\" UGO Networks listed Kuma as one of \\"The 50 Cutest Video Game Characters\\", adding \\"It‚Äôs always adorable when bears try to do human things\\". 1UP.com listed Kuma as one of the characters they wanted to see in Street Fighter X Tekken, stating \\"you can't have Tekken in the title without some sort of animal that is ready for a throwdown\\". In a GamesRadar article, a fight between Kuma and Zangief was written as one of the ones players wanted to see in Street Fighter X Tekken, commenting \\"In what will certainly be the most anticipated and, bizarrely, logical of these match ups, The Red Cyclone will finally be able to prove himself against his eternal arch nemesis, a bear.\\" FHM listed Kuma and Zangief as one of the \\"10 Awesome Fantasy Fights in Street Fighter X Tekken, adding \\"Dude‚Äôs strong enough to take on bears, but Kuma here is no ordinary bear.\\" PlayStation Official Magazine ranked Kuma as the seventh best tag team finisher in Street Fighter X Tekken, suggesting to \\"team the hairy great brute up with Kuro for the ultimate little-and-large comedy double act.\\" In 2012, Complex named Kuma's spinning backwards and his proposal to Panda as one of the \\"15 craziest moments in the Tekken series\\". Complex also ranked Kuma's denied proposal to Panda in the Tekken 3 ending as the \\"23rd funniest moment in video games, commenting \\"We cried laughing watching this ending. And we still cry. It's really that amazing.\\" 4thletter placed Kuma's (alongside Heihachi's) Street Fighter X Tekken and Tekken 4 endings at 200th and 76th places, respectively in their list \\"Top 200 Fighting Game Endings\\". Panda=Appearances= Panda is the pet of Ling Xiaoyu in the games since Tekken 3. Kuma is in love with Panda, but she is not interested in him romantically. Panda is cared for at Ling Xiaoyu's high school. To participate in the tournament, Ling moved to the Mishima Industrial College in Japan. Heihachi taught Panda advanced bear fighting so that she could act as a bodyguard for Xiaoyu throughout the series. Panda also appears in Tekken Card Challenge, Tekken Tag Tournament, Tekken 3D: Prime Edition and Tekken Tag Tournament 2. She is briefly seen in Xiaoyu's Street Fighter X Tekken promotional art where she is seen on the roof of what appears to be Mishima Polytechnic. In the same game, Chun-Li's Swap Costume is based on Panda's appearance. Panda appears in the CGI film Tekken: Blood Vengeance, as a supporting character, voiced by Taketora, who also voices Akuma in Street Fighter. =Design= Panda is, as her name implies, always depicted as a giant panda with pink or orange glowing bands and a green holster wrapped around her shoulder. The holster has grass inside of it. Since her introduction, she has always been a palette swap of Kuma, and thus has the same move set as him. In Tekken Tag Tournament 2, she is separated from Kuma and is given her own slot, even though she still has the same move set as Kuma's. They have the same moves, stance, and animations (shown before and after a fight), but their endings are always, in some way, different. Their animations (shown before and after a fight) are however differentiated in Tekken Tag Tournament 2, then followed by Tekken 7 where their movesets are identical except for their Rage Arts.

It is the 13th episode of the second season. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures on Deep Space Nine, a space station located near a stable wormhole between the Alpha and Gamma quadrants of the Milky Way Galaxy, in orbit of the planet Bajor. In this episode Chief O'Brien and Dr. Bashir help two races to destroy their biological weapons; but both governments want to ensure no technical knowledge of the weapons can survive. Plot Dr. Bashir and Chief O'Brien have spent the past week helping two races, the T'Lani and the Kellerun, dismantle deadly biological weapons known as \\"Harvesters\\". They assure the T'Lani and Kellerun ambassadors that all files related to the Harvesters have been destroyed, so as to prevent them from ever being created again. When the moment comes to destroy the final Harvester, two Kellerun soldiers enter the laboratory and begin shooting the scientists, T'Lani and Kellerun alike. Bashir and O'Brien overpower the soldiers, but a drop of the Harvester liquid falls on O'Brien's skin. To escape, they are forced to beam down to the surface of the planet they are orbiting. The T'Lani and Kellerun ambassadors inform Commander Sisko that O'Brien and Bashir died in an accident, and provide a recording purportedly showing the deaths of the entire science team due to an automated security routine. The senior staff of Deep Space Nine grieve the loss of their crewmates, and Sisko informs O'Brien's wife Keiko of his death. Meanwhile, Bashir and O'Brien are stranded in an abandoned town on the planet's surface. O'Brien tries to repair a broken communications system in order to inform the T'Lani of the Kelleruns' apparent betrayal. Bashir discovers that O'Brien has been infected by the Harvester and, as O'Brien's condition begins to deteriorate, is forced to take over the repair effort. Keiko insists that the recording of the supposed accident has been falsified: the video shows O'Brien drinking coffee in the afternoon, something she is certain he would never do. Sisko and Lt. Dax travel in a runabout vessel to visit the site of the \\"accident\\", where Dax investigates O'Brien and Bashir's runabout and finds evidence that its logs have been altered. The T'Lani and Kellerun ambassadors show up together at Bashir and O'Brien's hideout. They reveal that the attack on the science team was a joint endeavor meant to erase all knowledge that could potentially be used to make Harvesters, and prepare to execute Bashir and O'Brien. Sisko and Dax rescue them by transporting them to their runabout. The T'Lani and Kellerun demand their return and fire upon the runabout when Sisko refuses; but Sisko deceives them by escaping safely in the other runabout. As Chief O'Brien recovers from the Harvester poisoning back on Deep Space Nine, Keiko is stunned to discover that he does drink coffee in the afternoon.

He is introduced in Tekken 3 as an Aztec fighting god who is the game's main villain and final boss, along with his grotesque alter ego, True Ogre. Since his debut, Ogre has featured intermittently in the Tekken series with non-player roles in Tekken 4 as cameo and Tekken 5 in Devil Within Mode (only True Ogre), with several appearances in crossover games outside the Tekken franchise. He has received mostly positive critical reception for his design and characterization. Appearances=Tekken series= Ogre is believed to be a biological weapon abandoned on earth by an ancient alien race, while he is additionally worshipped by ancient Aztecs as the \\"God of Fighting\\". In Tekken 3 (1997), Heihachi Mishima sends his personal army, the Tekken Force, to search a temple in central Mexico, but they are promptly obliterated by Ogre. Having witnessed his power firsthand, Heihachi seeks an opportunity to use him in hopes of creating the ultimate life form while staving off his own aging process, and therefore stages the third edition of the King of Iron Fist Tournament held throughout the Tekken series in order to draw Ogre out. In the meantime, Ogre kills King in combat, beats Baek Doo San into a yearlong coma, and supposedly kills Jin's mother Jun Kazama. Paul Phoenix defeats Ogre in the tournament, but he then quits the competition under the impression that he has won, when he had one last opponent remaining in Ogre's true form, True Ogre. Heihachi then collects blood samples and skin tissue from the creature in order to splice his genomes with his own, but the project is unsuccessful, as he is missing a key ingredient called the \\"Devil Gene\\", which the series protagonist Jin Kazama and his father Kazuya possess. In Tekken 5 (2004), Ogre is playable in the \\"Arcade History\\" mode and is the final boss of the \\"Devil Within\\" minigame, where clones of him and Heihachi are defeated by Jin Kazama. Ogre appears in the noncanonical games Tekken Card Challenge and Tekken Mobile, and is playable in the spinoff titles Tekken Tag Tournament and in Tekken Tag Tournament 2, with a version of the character called Ancient Ogre exclusive to the console version of the latter as a download. Design and gameplay Ogre is the Tekken series' first main villain unrelated to the Mishima family. His first form resembles a tall, muscular humanoid with dark green skin and red glaring eyes. He adorns various types and pieces of old Aztec jewelry and a large golden helmet/crown with very long orange hair. He is also has a small round shield that is said to be the fabled Stone of the Sun, the Aztec calendar attached to his left arm. His True Ogre form differs greatly in appearance, resembling a gargoyle sporting large wings and horns with his neck enveloped in fur, and massive claws on his feet and left hand with the right composed of a series of writhing snakes. A swimsuit costume for True Ogre was included with pre-orders of Tekken Tag Tournament 2. In 2014, after a fan posted a still image from Tekken 3 on Twitter showing a silhouetted Ogre holding a disembodied head, Harada repeatedly denied it was that of Jun Kazama. Ogre does not have a specific fighting style, as it is borrowed from those of many different series characters. He achieves his \\"True Ogre\\" form after defeating and absorbing the soul of Heihachi Mishima (or his grandson if the player plays as Heihachi). =Other games and merchandise= Ogre makes a cameo appearance in the 2005 tactical role-playing game Namco x Capcom as a non-playable boss. Ogre is selectable in the 2012 crossover fighter Street Fighter X Tekken, in which he serves as a final boss and is part of the storyline of the game's characters traveling to the Antarctic in pursuit of an artifact called \\"Pandora's Box\\". While he is not physically seen, Ogre's presence is felt in the final scene of Tekken: The Motion Picture. The character appeared in several Tekken-related comic books published between 1997 and 2012. Bandai Namco released an Epoch Co. Tekken 3 action figure of True Ogre in 1999. Reception Ogre was rated the 23rd-best Tekken character in 2017 by Gavin Jasper of Den of Geek: \\"True Ogre has the overkill you‚Äôd want in a final boss, but the understated green statue of an Aztec warrior has its own ominous feel to it.\\" However, he considered it \\"for the best that he never became a recurring villain. Tekken 3 was enough and it springboarded the Mishima bloodline feud into a new direction upon his death.\\" Kevin Wong of Complex said of True Ogre in 2013: \\"Heihachi + Ogre = Holy shit. When we first saw this beast in Tekken 3, we were intimidated, and that was before he started breathing fire. Mountains of quarters were wasted on conquering this behemoth. In the first Tekken Tag Tournament, True Ogre was the ultimate, broken partner, forming the backbone of nearly every team in every competition. Tom Goulter of GamesRadar said in 2012, \\"Ogre's lack of a sombrero, a penchant for Salsa dancing, or any known connection to drug crime marks him as one of the more progressive Latino videogame characters in recent years.\\" Lucas Sullivan of GamesRadar included the Namco X Capcom roster among his \\"15 most bizarre crossovers in gaming\\" in 2012: \\"The day that Captain Commando, Klonoa, Huitzil, and Ogre co-exist in the same game is a grand day indeed.\\" In 2012, FHM listed Ogre and Akuma as one of the \\"10 Awesome Fantasy Fights in Street Fighter X Tekken\\". In 2013, Complex's Gus Turner ranked Ogre the nineteenth-\\"Most Feared God in Video Games\\": \\"An Aztec deity, Ogre is the God of Fighting, which, obviously, makes him a pretty good fit for the Tekken series. Just take a look at him. What else needs to be said?\\" In 2015, CDKeys rated him the sixth-best fighting game villain: \\"True Ogre is a great visual, and helped players enjoy an epic conclusion to one of the PlayStation‚Äôs best fighting games.\\" In Game Rant list \\"Tekken: The 5 Best & 5 Worst Fighters Of All Time\\", Ogre was ranked among the best: \\"A recurring series villain, it‚Äôs not to be trifled with, boasting an unpredictable range of moves from characters from across the series.\\" Computer and Video Games named Ogre one of \\"Tekken 's worst ever characters\\" in 2011, describing him as \\"look[ing] more in-character on a Mardi Gras float passing out flower garlands than he does being hit in the face by Paul Phoenix\\". In a 2012 fan poll held by Bandai Namco, Ogre was only the 47th-most requested out of 54 Tekken characters for inclusion in the unreleased crossover Tekken X Street Fighter, receiving 1,994 (2.26%) of 88,280 votes.

It was first published by HarperCollins in 1993. Plot summary The novel is set in a dystopic Toronto, Ontario buffeted by a mysterious plague called sturnusemia, which is believed to be carried by starlings. Against this backdrop Lilah Kemp, a schizophrenic spiritualist \\"of intense but undisciplined powers\\", accidentally sets Kurtz free from page 92 of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness and is forced to find a Marlow to defeat him. Kurtz becomes head of the Parkin Psychiatric Institute (based on the real Clarke Institute of Psychiatry) and travels among the city's elites, including a \\"Club of Men\\" which is in fact a child pornography ring. Marlow, meanwhile, is a staff psychiatrist at the Parkin. Although the reader is clearly meant to see the parallels between Findley's Kurtz and Marlow and Conrad's original characters, the book is deliberately ambiguous about whether Lilah Kemp has really performed this act of literary magic, or is merely crazy enough to think she has.

Bart Simpson's classic \\"I didn't do it, no one saw me do it, you can't prove anything!\\" could be considered a somewhat humorous example. In a more serious example, a lawyer might argue, not only that his client was elsewhere when a murder or other crime took place, but also that even if he had been on the scene, he would have had no way of accessing the alleged murder weapon. In this way, the lawyer attacks several premises of the prosecution's argument at once. The secondary line of reasoning might be presented to persuade a sub-audience who would not otherwise agree with the primary argument. In regards to contract law, arguing in the alternative is done where a dispute arises over the terms of a contract. In a particular case it may be best for the plaintiff to allege that a statement made was to become a term of the contract. However the circumstances of the case may be such that the plaintiff cannot be certain that the court will accept this argument. To allow for this possibility, all the plaintiff need do is to argue in the alternative that the statement was in fact a representation (which allows for remedies based on misrepresentation) or again in the alternative that the statement became a part of a collateral contract. Occasionally, such arguments can be confusing to some people, who perceive a self-contradiction. Generally speaking, this is a case of mistakenly thinking the argument claims both alternatives are true, when in reality it is claiming only that one or the other of them must be.

In international law it commonly refers to land transferred by treaty. Ballentine's Law Dictionary defines cession as \\"a surrender; a giving up; a relinquishment of jurisdiction by a board in favor of another agency.\\"Ballentine's Law Dictionary, p. 72. In contrast with annexation, where property is forcibly seized, cession is voluntary or at least apparently so. Examples In 1790, the U.S. states of Maryland and Virginia both ceded land to create the District of Columbia, as specified in the U.S. Constitution of the previous year. The Virginia portion was given back in 1847, a process known as \\"retrocession\\". Following the First Opium War (18391842) and Second Opium War (18561860), Hong Kong (Treaty of Nanking) and Kowloon (Convention of Peking) were ceded by the Qing dynasty government of China to the United Kingdom; and following defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War, Taiwan was ceded to the Empire of Japan in 1895. Territory can also be ceded for payment, such as in the Louisiana Purchase and Alaska Purchase. Specific areas of law=Contract law= This is a yielding up, or release.Balentine's Law Dictionary, p. 72. France ceded Louisiana to the United States by the treaty of Paris, of April 30, 1803. Spain made a cession of East and West Florida by the treaty of February 22, 1819. Cessions have been severally made of a part of their territory by New York, Virginia, Massachusetts, Connecticut, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia. =Civil law= Under the civil law system, cession is the equivalent of assignment, and therefore, is an act by which a personal claim is transferred from the assignor (the cedent) to the assignee (the cessionary). Whereas real rights are transferred by delivery, personal rights are transferred by cession. Once the obligation of the debtor is transferred, the cessionary is entirely substituted. The original creditor (cedent) loses his right to claim and the new creditor (cessionary) gains that right. =Ecclesiastical law= When an ecclesiastic is created bishop, or when a parson or rector takes another benefice without dispensation, the first benefice becomes void by a legal cession, or surrender. Retrocession Retrocession is the return of something (e.g., land) that was ceded in general or, specifically: Examples: *District of Columbia retrocession, the retrocession to Virginia, and potentially to Maryland, of the land ceded to create the District of Columbia *Retrocession of Louisiana (New Spain) from Spain to France, formally accomplished just three weeks before the U.S. received the Louisiana Purchase lands from France In insurance, retrocessional arrangements generally are governed by a reinsurance or retrocessional agreement and the principles applicable to reinsurance also are applicable to retrocessional cover.

It was released in May 1975 and, like its direct predecessor, targeted the DEC PDP-11 family of minicomputers. It was superseded by Version 7 Unix in 1978/1979, although V6 systems remained in regular operation until at least 1985. AT&T; Corporation licensed Version 5 Unix to educational institutions only, but licensed Version 6 also to commercial users for $20,000, and it remained the most widely used version into the 1980s. An enhanced V6 was the basis of the first ever commercially sold Unix version, INTERACTIVE's IS/1. Bell's own PWB/UNIX 1.0 was also based on V6, where earlier (unreleased) versions were based on V4 and V5. Whitesmiths produced and marketed a (binary- compatible) V6 clone under the name Idris. Source code John Lions' original books, source code and commentary Browsing through /usr/source on Version 6 Unix, running on SIMH V6 Unix was released as a distribution including the full source code. Since source code was available and the license was not explicit enough to forbid it, V6 was taken up as a teaching tool, notably by the University of California, Berkeley, Johns Hopkins University and the University of New South Wales (UNSW). UC Berkeley distributed a set of add-on programs called the First Berkeley Software Distribution or 1BSD, which later became a complete operating system distribution. UNSW professor John Lions' famous Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition was an edited selection of the main parts of the kernel as implemented for a Digital PDP-11/40, and was the main source of kernel documentation for many early Unix developers. Due to license restrictions on later Unix versions, the book was mainly distributed by samizdat photo-copying. The source code for the original V6 Unix was later made available as free software under a BSD License from the SCO Group. Portability=Interdata 7/32= In 1977, Richard Miller and Ross Nealon, working under the supervision of professor Juris Reinfelds at Wollongong University, completed a port of V6 Unix to the Interdata 7/32,\\"The First Port of UNIX\\", Juris Reinfelds\\"The First Unix Port\\", Richard Miller thus proving the portability of Unix and its new systems programming language C in practice. Their \\"Wollongong Interdata UNIX, Level 6\\" also included utilities developed at Wollongong, and later releases had features of V7, notably its C compiler. Wollongong Unix was the first ever port to a platform other than the PDP series of computers, proving that portable operating systems were indeed feasible, and that C was the language in which to write them. In 1980, this version was licensed to The Wollongong Group in Palo Alto that published it as Edition 7. =Interdata 8/32= Around the same time, a Bell Labs port to the Interdata 8/32 was completed, but not externally released. The goal of this port was to improve the portability of Unix more generally, as well to produce a portable version of the C compiler. The resulting Portable C Compiler (PCC) was distributed with V7 and many later versions of Unix, and was used to produce the UNIX/32V port to the VAX. =IBM VM/370= A third Unix portability project was completed at Princeton, N.J. in 1976‚Äì1977, where the Unix kernel was adapted to run as a guest operating on IBM's VM/370 virtualization environment. This version became the nucleus of Amdahl's first internal UNIX offering. (see Amdahl UTS) Variants and extensions Bell Labs developed several variants of V6, including the stripped-down MINI-UNIX for low-end PDP-11 models, LSI-UNIX or LSX for the LSI-11, and the real-time operating system UNIX/RT, which merged V6 Unix and the earlier MERT hypervisor. After AT&T; decided the distribution by Bell Labs of a number of pre-V7 bug fixes would constitute support (disallowed by an antitrust settlement) a tape with the patchset was slipped to Lou Katz of USENIX, who distributed them. The University of Sydney released the Australian Unix Share Accounting Method (AUSAM) in November 1979, a V6 variant with improved security and process accounting. In the Eastern Bloc, clones of V6 Unix appeared for local-built PDP-11 clones (MNOS, later augmented for partial compatibility with BSD Unix) and for the Elektronika BK personal computer (BKUNIX, based on LSX). V6 was used for teaching at MIT in 2002 through 2006, and subsequently replaced by a simpler clone called xv6.

He was referred to as one of the \\"Merchant Princes\\" of Wall Street in the years leading up to the American Civil War. Dodge saw slavery as an evil to be peaceably removed, but not to be interfered with where it existed. He was a Native American rights activist and served as the president of the National Temperance Society from 1865 to 1883. Dodge represented New York's 8th congressional district in the United States Congress for a portion of the 39th United States Congress in 1866-1867 and was a founding member of the YMCA of the USA. Biography William Earl Dodge was born in Hartford, Connecticut, the second son of David Low Dodge, founder of the New York Peace Society, and his wife Sarah Cleveland, the daughter of minister Aaron Cleveland.The Descendants of John Porter of Windsor, Conn. 1635-9, Volume 1 retrieved January 19, 2013The Dodge Family Association: \\"David Low Dodge Jr.\\" retrieved January 19, 2013 He married Melissa Phelps (1809‚Äì1903), a daughter of Anson Green Phelps and Olivia Egleston. The couple had seven sons. In 1833, Dodge and his father-in-law founded the trading firm Phelps, Dodge and Company. In 1908 they became one of Americas largest mining companies Phelps Dodge Corporation. Dodge is the namesake of Dodge County, Georgia. A consortium of businessmen led by Dodge purchased large tracts of timberland in this area following the Civil War. The Dodge Land Company laid claim to over of land through questionable land deeds.pg.444 \\"The New Georgia Guide\\" The consortium's ownership of these lands led to land wars which resulted in nearly fifty years of court cases. Dodge and his associates built the Macon and Brunswick Railroad, connecting Macon to what was then a remote area of the state. Dodge County was formed in 1870 and Eastman, the county seat, was established at the railroad's Station Number 13. Dodge visited the area only once, to dedicate a two-story courthouse that he donated to the county. Dodge's sons later administered the timber businesses in this area. Dodge was active in the post-Civil War Native American policy reform movement. He joined Peter Cooper in organizing the privately funded United States Indian Commission in 1868 and helped institute Ulysses S. Grant's Peace Policy toward Native Americans. In 1869, Dodge toured the Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) and Kansas as a member of the government-sponsored Board of Indian Commissioners. He met and discussed U.S. Indian policy with representatives of the Cheyenne, Arapaho and Kiowa nations. Dodge lobbied for the prosecution of the U.S. cavalry commanders responsible for the 1870 Marias Massacre in Montana, which left 173 Blackfeet dead. Dodge unsuccessfully campaigned to establish a cabinet-level Department for Indian Affairs. He also used his influence in Washington on behalf of Native educational programs and the General Allotment Act of 1887. Dodge‚Äôs core belief regarding Native Americans during the 1880‚Äôs was that the only way to save Native Americans from perceived destructed from Euro-American immigration and railway development was the forced education of Native American children that would ultimately lead to American citizenship. A monument to William E. Dodge stands on the North side of Bryant Park in New York City. Dodge was a founding member of the Board of Trustees for the Syrian Protestant College, later renamed the American University of Beirut. As Treasurer, he laid the cornerstone of College Hall, the first building on the present campus in Ras Beirut, on December 7, 1871. His eldest son, William Earl Dodge Jr., assumed control of the Phelps Dodge company after his death. See also * William E. Dodge Jr. * Cleveland Hoadley Dodge * Bayard Dodge * David S.

They are best known for their series of scholarly publications of ancient Armenian versions of otherwise lost ancient Greek texts and their research on classical and modern Armenian language. They follow the Rule of Saint Benedict. The congregation was long divided into two branches, with the respective motherhouses being in Venice and Vienna. In July 2000 they united to form one institute. History The island of San Lazzaro, with the monastery and the church of Mekhitarists. Their eponymous founder, Mekhitar of Sebaste, was born at Sebastia in Armenia, then part of the Ottoman Empire, in 1676. He entered a monastery, but was concerned about the level of culture and education in Armenia under Turkish rule at that period, and sought to do something about it. Contacts with Western missionaries led him to become interested in translating material from the West into Armenian and setting up a religious order to facilitate education. Mekhitar set out for Rome in 1695 to make his ecclesiastical studies there, but he was compelled by illness to abandon the journey and return to Armenia. In 1696 he was ordained a priest and for four years worked among his people. In 1700 Mekhitar went to Istanbul and began to gather disciples around him. Mechitar formally joined the Latin Church, and in 1701, with sixteen companions, he formed a religious order of which he became the superior. They encountered the opposition of other Armenians and were compelled to move to the Morea (Peloponnese), at that time Venetian territory, where they built a monastery in 1706. At its inception the order was seen as an attempted reform of Eastern monachism. Jesuit priest Filippo Bonanni wrote of the arrival of two Armenian monks, Elias Martyr and Joannes Simon, sent by Mechitar to Pope Clement XI to offer the most humble subjection of himself and convent (Ut ei se cum suis religiosis humillime subjiceret). At that time, there was no mention of the Rule of Saint Benedict. Pope Clement XI gave his approval to the order in 1712. The monks began a foundation in Modon with Mechitar as abbot. On the outbreak of hostilities between the Turks and Venetians they migrated to Venice, and the island of San Lazzaro was given to them in 1717. This has remained the headquarters of the congregation to this date; Mechitar died there in 1749, leaving his order firmly established. The order became very wealthy from gifts. The behaviour of the Abbot Melkhonian caused a group of monks to leave in disgust and elect their own abbot, first at Trieste and then in 1810 at Vienna. They also established a printing press. The work of printing of Armenian books was by this time of great financial importance and the Venetian Republic made considerable efforts to encourage their return, but in vain.Cassanova, History of my life (p.265). In 1810 all the other monastic institutions in Venice were abolished by Napoleon, but the Mekhitarists were exempted by name from the decree. Byron's visit to San Lazzaro in 1816 Lord Byron visited the monastery on 13 November 1816, a Wednesday. His companion John Cam Hobhouse left this account of the visit: > Byron and I then went in [a] gondola to [the] establishment of St Lazare. It > was some time before we were let in ‚Äì the brothers were at prayer, but when > we walked into their church one of them bowed out and most courteously > showed us about.

While the Mekhitarists live under the Rule of Saint Benedict, they are considered their own religious order separate from the Benedictines, similar to the Cistercians, hence they are not considered a congregation within the Order of Saint Benedict. The main abbeys are San Lazzaro degli Armeni in Venice and the Mekhitarist Monastery in Vienna. There is a large convent and college for lay students at Padua, the legacy of a pious Armenian who died at Madras. In the year 1846 another rich benefactor, Samuel Morin, founded a similar establishment at Paris. Other houses were established in Austria-Hungary, Russia, Persia and Turkey ‚Äî fourteen in all, according to early 20th century statistics, with one hundred and fifty-two monks, the majority of whom are priests. While not large for an order hundreds of years old, its extension was necessarily restricted because of its exclusive devotion to persons and things Armenian. In 1911 they had fifteen establishments in various places in Asia Minor and Europe with some 150 monks, all Armenians; they used the Armenian language and rite in the liturgy. Monastic life After a novitiate of two years, monks take the usual religious vows, along with a fourth vow ‚Äî \\"to give obedience to the preceptor or master deputed by their superior to teach them the dogmas of the Catholic Faith\\". Many of them vow themselves also to missionary work in Armenia, Persia and Turkey, where they live on alms and wear as a badge, beneath the tunic, a cross of red cloth, on which are certain letters signifying their desire to shed their blood for the Catholic faith. They promise on oath to work together in harmony so that they may the better win the schismatics back to God. They elect an abbot for life, who has the power to dismiss summarily any of his monks who should prove disorderly. They wear the beard, Oriental fashion, and have a black habit ‚Äî tunic, cloak and hood. In an engraving, the Mekhitarists would be undistinguishable from a friar of the Order of St. Augustine, except for his beard. The Mekhitarists at first followed the rule attributed to Saint Anthony, but when they settled in the West modifications from the Rule of Saint Benedict were introduced. The use of the Rule of Saint Benedict represented the introduction of Western monasticism into the East, where up to this time a monk had no duty or vocation but to fill his place in the monastery and save his soul in the cloister, having broken off all relations with the outside world and had no idea of performing any works other than his choir duties, prayers, fastings, and the monastic observance. Under the Rule of Saint Benedict, a monk would be expected to devote himself to some useful work and take some thought of his neighbour. This adoption of the rule was desired by Mechitar and his monks, having a desire to devote themselves to apostolic work among their schismatic brethren, to instruct their ignorance, excite their devotion and bring them back into the communion with the Catholic Church. At the same time, it also offered security against lapsing into the apathy and inactivity associated in the Eastern mind with the life of the cloister. Missionaries, writers and educationists, devoted to the service of their Armenian brethren wherever they might be found, such are these Benedictines of the Eastern Church. Their subjects usually enter the convent at an early age, eight or nine years old, receive in it their elementary schooling, spend about nine years in philosophical and theological study, at the canonical age of twenty-five, if sufficiently prepared, are ordained priests by their bishop-abbot, and are then employed by him in the various enterprises of the order. First, there is the work of the mission ‚Äî not the conversion of the heathen, but priestly ministry to the Armenian communities settled in most of the commercial centres of Europe. With this is joined, where needed and possible, the apostolate of union with Rome. Next there is the education of the Armenian youth and, associated with this, the preparation and publication of good and useful Armenian literature. Their work has been fourfold: # they have brought out editions of important patristic works, some Armenian, others translated into Armenian from Greek and Syriac originals no longer extant; # until the late 20th century they printed and circulated Armenian literature among the Armenians, thereby exercising a powerful educational influence; # they have founded primary and secondary schools in various locations, four of which are still operational: in Istanbul, Pangaltƒ± Ermeni ƒ∞lk√∂ƒüretim Okulu ve Lisesi, founded in 1825, in Beirut, founded in 1930, in Buenos Aires founded in 1956 and in Los Angeles, founded in 1979; # they work as Eastern Catholic missionaries in Armenia. =Literary and artistic activities= Mechitar is credited for the initiating the study of the Armenian writings of the fourth and fifth centuries, which has resulted in the development and adoption of a literary language, nearly as distinct from the vulgar tongue as Latin is from Italian. This provided modern Armenian with a literary connection to its ancient past and literature. Mechitar, with his Armenian \\"Imitation\\" and \\"Bible\\", began that series of translations of great books, continued unceasingly during two centuries, and ranging from the early Fathers of the Church and the works of St. Thomas of Aquin (one of their first labors) to Homer and Virgil and the best known poets and historians of later days. Artist, Ariel Agemian, illustrated the \\"Imitation\\" and contributed several major portraits of Mekhitarist Monks and religious scenes. He is also known for documenting the Turkish Massacre from his own recollections. At one period, in connexion with their Vienna house, there existed an association for the propagation of good books, which is said to have distributed nearly a million volumes, and printed and published six new works each year. To him also they owe the guidance of their first steps in exegesis ‚Äî the branch of learning in which they have won most distinction ‚Äî and the kindred studies of the Liturgy and the religious history of their country. At San Lazzaro he founded the printing press from which the most notable of their productions have been issued, and commenced there the collection of Armenian manuscripts for which their library has become famous. To any but members of the order the history of the Mekhitarists has been uneventful, because of the quiet, untiring plodding along ancient, traditional paths, and the admirable fidelity to the spirit and ideals of their founder. Principally by means of the Mekhitarists' innumerable periodicals, pious manuals, Bibles, maps, engravings, dictionaries, histories, geographies and other contributions to educational and popular literature they have served Catholism among the Armenian nation. The following are the most valuable of their contributions to the common cause of learning. Firstly the recovery, in ancient Armenian translations, of some lost works of the Fathers of the Church. Among them may be noted Letters (thirteen) of St. Ignatius of Antioch and a fuller and more authentic \\"History of the Martyrdom of St. Ignatius\\"; some works of St. Ephrem the Syrian, notably a sort of \\"Harmony of the Gospels\\" and a \\"Commentary on the Epistles of St. Paul\\"; an edition of Eusebius's Ecclesiastical History. The publication of these works is due to the famous Mekhitarists Dom Pascal Aucher, who was assisted in the last of them by Cardinal Mai. Pascal Aucher (Harut'iwn Awgerian: 1774-1855) also became Lord Byron‚Äôs tutor in Armenian, and his \\"spiritual pastor and master\\". He translated Paradise Lost into Armenian (1824). To Aucher also we are indebted for a German translation of the \\"Armenian Missal\\" (T√ºbingen, 1845) and \\"Dom Johannis philosophi Ozniensis Armeniorum Catholici (AD 718) Opera\\" (Venice, 1534). Two original historical works may also be noted: \\"The History of Armenia\\", by P. Michel Tschamtschenanz (1784‚Äì1786) and the \\"Quadro della storia letteraria di Armenia\\" by Mgr. Pl. Sukias Somal (Venice, 1829). Amongst their countrymen the influence of the monks has been not only directive in the way of holiness and true service to God and the Church, but creative of a wholesome national ambition and self-respect. Apostles of culture and progress, they may be said, with strict justice, to have preserved from degradation and neglect the language and literature of their country, and in so doing, have been the saviours of the Armenian race. Individually, the monks are distinguished by their linguistic accomplishments, and the Vienna establishment has attracted attention by the institution of a Literary Academy, which confers honorary membership without regard to race or religion.

Tweaks are any small modifications intended to improve a system. In electronics, it is a synonym for \\"trimming.\\" Analog circuit boards often have small potentiometers or other components on them that are used to calibrate or adjust the board as a service procedure: the small insulated screwdriver used to turn them is often called a \\"tweaker.\\" This use was echoed in the name of the product Tweek, a popular but controversial audio product during the 1980s, which was claimed to improve the electrical characteristics of audio switch contacts. Hardware Hardware tweaking is a process of modifying certain parts of a hardware such as changing the cables, cleaning the heads of a VHS player with a branded cleaning fluid or oiling the moving parts of an engine with the best possible oil. Computer hardware Computer hardware tweaking is an extension of hardware tweaking, specifically geared towards the components of a PC. They include: changing voltage and clock rates of processing units, modifying RAM unit timing, improving cooling systems to reduce chance of overheating, etc. Tweaks specifically designed to allow a processor to operate at a higher clock speed than normal are known as overclocking. Modifications of computer systems not aimed at increasing performance, such as quieter fans, external controls, and decorations such as lights or windows, are known as modding. Software Software tweaking is the process of improving the performance of an application or the quality of its output. There can be two ways of accomplishing this: manually (that is, if one is familiar with programming; though it may be irrelevant if the source of the application is closed, and there are no built-in means to adjust its performance) or using another piece of software specialized for that purpose. Tweaking of this kind generally increases usability, in terms of personal configuration preferences, rather than objective performance of the system overall). Some very precise applications need constant and thorough tweaking to stay up to date and deliver best possible results. One of the most obvious examples of such a fine tuning is LAME MP3 encoder, whose 3.9x branch is not only considered as the state-of-the-art MP3 encoder, but also continues to shape the boundaries of the MP3 codec and stay competitive with its successors.

Head East's version of this song was their highest charting single. A year later, Rainbow recorded the song and released it as the first single from their 1979 album Down to Earth with Graham Bonnet on lead vocals.

It is an all-Arabic channel based in Doha, Qatar that broadcasts conferences and other events live without editing or commentary, using subtitles when translation is needed. The channel is also sometimes referred to as Al Jazeera Live,BBC NEWS  World  Middle East  Al-Jazeera launches new channel as Mubasher is an Arabic word for Live (as in live broadcast) and Al-‚ÄòAmma is Arabic for General. The channel was formerly called just Al Jazeera Mubasher. Al Jazeera Mubasher Al-‚ÄòAmma is the first channel of its kind in the Arab world and is similar to the U.S. channel C-SPAN and UK channel BBC Parliament. The channel also has a live stream of its broadcast on its website. In 2014, the channel underwent a graphics upgrade as part of Al Jazeera Media Networks graphics upgrade across the company. Launched in April 2005, Al Jazeera Mubasher is the first Middle Eastern 24-hour live news and events channel. Acting as the eyes and ears of the Arab world, the channel is dedicated to giving viewers real-time footage of global and regional events. The channel has remote feeds and on-the-ground cameras broadcasting political gatherings, press conferences, discussions, and meetings, bringing audiences the latest on political, social, cultural and economic affairs. When people want events as they happen, they turn to Al Jazeera Mubasher‚Äîlive and uncut. On December 20, 2014 it was announced that Al Jazeera Media Network would coalesce both Al Jazeera Mubasher and the temporarily suspended Al Jazeera Mubasher Misr in to a new combined channel called Al Jazeera Al-‚ÄòAmma (AJMG) or Al Jazeera Live General. The new Al Jazeera Mubasher Al-‚ÄòAmma reports live events from all over the globe simultaneously with round-the-clock analysis. The channel‚Äôs focus is to ensure interaction between viewers and unfolding events. The channel is built to serve as an open space for viewers to air their views rather than them simply receiving information. The output rely much on viewer suggestions rather than a traditional pattern of fixed transmission grid. Egyptian channel A similar channel called Al Jazeera Mubasher Misr (AJMM; ) similar to its original sister channel minus some commentary operated in Egypt based in Cairo from 2011 to 2014. The channel functioned similar to its main counterpart but was shut down by the Egyptian government after the removal of Mohamed Morsi due to its pro-Brotherhood slant. The channel's staff were arrested but later released. In the period from 2013 until its suspension it broadcast from Al Jazeera's Doha headquarters running video brought in through other sources such as YouTube and Reuters and press conferences taped from other news organizations in the country. Al Jazeera Mubasher Misr has meanwhile temporarily ceased broadcasting until such time as necessary permits are issued for its return to Cairo in coordination with the Egyptian authorities. Al Jazeera Mubasher Al‚ÄòAmma is therefore transmitting on the frequencies of both Al Jazeera Mubasher and Al Jazeera Mubasher Misr.

The play opened on 11 August 1971 at The Pram Factory theatre in Carlton.\\"Australian Performing Group\\" (advertisement), Melbourne Age, 6 August 1971 p. 8 Plot Don Henderson is a schoolteacher living with his wife Kath and baby son in the Melbourne suburb of Lower Plenty.Pat Dreverman, \\"Young will act out life's absurdities\\", Melbourne Age, 4 August 1971 p. 20 On the night of the 1969 federal election Don invites a small group of friends to celebrate a predicted Australian Labor Party (ALP) election victory, much to the dismay of his wife. To the party come Mal, Don‚Äôs university mentor, and his bitter wife Jenny, sex-obsessed Cooley and his latest girlfriend, nineteen-year-old Susan, Evan, a dentist, and his beautiful artist wife Kerry. Somehow, two Liberal supporters, Simon and Jody also come. As the party wears on it becomes clear that the Labor party, which is supported by Don and most of the guests, is not winning. As a result, alcohol consumption increases, and the sniping between Don and his male friends about their failed aspirations gets uglier, as does their behaviour toward the women. Mack, a design engineer whose wife has just left him, pulls out a nude photo of her for his friends' approval. Crass womaniser Cooley pursues the available women. The disillusioned wives exchange tales of their husbands' sub-par sexual performance. By the end of the night, Don and some of his friends have begun to grasp the emptiness of their compromised lives. The play led to a 2011 sequel, Don Parties On. Film version In 1976, a film version was released with a screenplay by Williamson, directed by Bruce Beresford. John Hargreaves plays Don Henderson with Jeanie Drynan as Don's wife Kath. Ray Barrett plays Mal, Don's mentor, and Pat Bishop is his wife. Graham Kennedy plays Mack, Graeme Blundell is the repressed Australian Liberal Party supporter and Veronica Lang his obedient wife. Kerry (Candy Raymond) is the attractive and assertive artist and Evan (Kit Taylor) is her uptight and possessive partner. Cooley (Harold Hopkins) comes with his young girlfriend Susan (Clare Binney). In the film the setting is relocated to the suburb of Westleigh in the northern suburbs of Sydney. The film also deviates from the stage version by increasing the level of profanity and contains full frontal nudity and sex scenes. Pat Bishop won the AFI Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, Veronica Lang won the AFI Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, Bruce Beresford won the Best Direction award, David Williamson won the Best screenplay award, and the film won the edit and sound award. The film was entered into the 27th Berlin International Film Festival. The video clip to You Am I's 1998 single \\"What I Don't Know 'bout You\\" is a tribute to 'Don's Party'. It features classic scenes from the movie re-enacted by noted Australian actors, including Stephen Curry, Ben Mendelsohn, Matt Day, Tania Lacy and Nadine Garner. =Cast= * Ray Barrett as Mal, a crass former psychologist, now practising as a management consultant * Clare Binney as Susan, Cooley's 19-year-old girlfriend, a university student * Pat Bishop, who was awarded the Australian Film Institute (AFI) Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, as Jenny, Mal's long-suffering wife * Graeme Blundell as Simon, a nervous accountant for an industrial plastic company and a Liberal supporter * Jeanie Drynan as Kath Henderson, Don's wife, co-host of the party * John Hargreaves as Don Henderson, host of the party, schoolteacher * Harold Hopkins as Grainger Cooley, a sex-obsessed, loud-mouthed lawyer * Graham Kennedy as Mack, a recently separated design engineer * Veronica Lang, who was awarded the AFI Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, as Jody. * Candy Raymond as Kerry, a rude and snooty painter who has had four major art exhibitions * Kit Taylor as Evan, Kerry's boyfriend, an uptight, socialist dentist * John Gorton as himself (he was the incumbent Prime Minister of Australia at the election, and his party won a narrow victory) (cameo) * Bruce Beresford as bottle shop attendant (cameo) =Production= In 1973 Phillip Adams was approached to make the film by Jack Lee, who wanted to direct. At the time Adams felt that comedies were the only genre of film likely to redeem themselves financially in Australia, so he felt he would easily be able to raise finance for the movie, which he did not think would cost more than $300,000. However Adams was busy at the time working on the Australia Council, which held up his involvement for 12 months; at the end of that time, Australia was in the middle of a credit squeeze and he found it more difficult than he expected to get the money.Gordon Glenn & Scott Murray, \\"Phil Adams: Producer\\", Cinema Papers, March‚ÄìApril 1976 p. 340-343 Problems then emerged when the director Lee wanted to make the film into a broader comedy, which made Williamson uncomfortable and Adams was worried about raising finance with Lee attached, so Lee pulled out.David Stratton, The Last New Wave: The Australian Film Revival, Angus & Robertson, 1980 p. 47-48 Adams approached Ken Hannam but he lacked sympathy for the characters and found them too aggressive. Tim Burstall and Peter Weir were approached but they also turned down the film. Eventually Adams approached Bruce Beresford, who agreed. There was some discussion that the events of the play be updated to the 1975 Federal election, but in the end it was decided to keep the screenplay faithful to the original play as it was widely believed in 1975 that Labor would lose-which was not the case in 1969. The setting was relocated to Sydney, in part because it was felt it would be cheaper but also to ensure audiences did not feel the movie was \\"too Melbourne\\". The budget was raised from the Australian Film Commission and private investors, mainly exhibitors. Adams wanted to cast Paul Hogan as Cooley but the actor declined. Ray Barrett had played that role in London but was considered too old to do it on film, and was given the part of Mal instead. He was changed from being an ex-student to a lecturer to allow for his age. Graeme Blundell took the role of an accountant in order to escape typecasting as Alvin Purple. (Blundell had produced the original play in 1971.)Leonard Radic, \\"Hang ups at Lower Plenty\\", Melbourne Age, 16 August 1971 p. 2 Barry Crocker was originally meant to play Don but was replaced by John Hargreaves. Hargreaves later claimed this took place at short notice when Crocker 'broke his back... the day before rehearsals'.Tony Watts and Genevieve Picot, John Hargreaves... a Celebration: an actor's life as he saw it', Parrot Books, 2000 p.83 Shooting began in January 1976 and took roughly five weeks, using a house in Westleigh as the main location. John Gorton played a cameo as himself as a tribute to his contribution in helping re-establish the Australian film industry. =Box Office= Phillip Adams originally distributed the film himself. Don's Party grossed $871,000 at the box office in Australia, which is equivalent to $4,503,070 in 2009 dollars.

The station is owned by Gold Coast Broadcasting and airs a rhythmic contemporary music format. KCAQ was simulcast on AM sister station KKZZ (1520 AM) in Port Hueneme until August 2019. History=Early years= The station at 95.9 FM began broadcasting on August 15, 1972 as KEWE with an automated soft rock format. Five years later, the station changed its call sign to KGAB and flipped to an album-oriented rock format known as \\"B96\\". In 1982, KGAB adopted the call letters KZTR and an adult contemporary format known as \\"K-Star\\". The station flipped to classic rock in 1987 with the branding \\"96ZTR\\". In September 1988, Gold Coast Communications Corp. sold KZTR and AM sister station KCZN to Golden Bear Broadcasting Inc. for $1,967,500. This amount is comparable to the sum of the two stations' previous individual purchase prices in 1985 and 1986, respectively. Three years later, on July 10, 1991, the station changed its call letters to KELF to reflect its new regional Mexican music format branded \\"El Elefante\\". =KOCP (1995‚Äì2016)= On October 21, 1994, Gold Coast Broadcasting (not to be confused with the aforementioned Gold Coast Communications) purchased KELF and KKZZ from Golden Bear Broadcasting for $1.2 million. The following February, the station adopted the KOCP call letters and launched a classic rock format known as \\"95.9 The Octopus\\". On August 25, 2010, KOCP flipped to classic hits, identifying as \\"Rewind 95.9\\". The first song on Rewind was \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" by Michael Jackson. On August 29, 2014, KOCP adopted a rhythmic oldies format with the branding \\"Old School 95.9\\". =KCAQ (2016‚Äìpresent)= On July 1, 2016, KOCP swapped frequencies with sister station KCAQ, moving from 95.9 FM to 104.7 FM. This move brought the KCAQ call letters and rhythmic contemporary format to the 95.9 FM frequency, now rebranded \\"Q95.9\\". On September 11, 2017, KCAQ began airing the nationally syndicated Tino Cochino Radio program originating from KKFR in Phoenix. From November 2018 to August 2019, KCAQ was simulcast on KKZZ (1520 AM), which dropped its adult standards format. Transmission issues KCAQ operates on the same frequency as KFSH-FM, a Class A station in La Mirada, California. The two stations are short spaced to each other as the cities they are licensed to serve are apart. Under Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules, the minimum distance between Class A and Class B1 stations operating on the same channel is . As such, the station competes for signal strength along the outer edge of its broadcast area, particularly in the San Fernando Valley. This interference makes both signals generally unable to be received clearly in much of northwestern Los Angeles County.

It is a resident breeder in tropical South America from Colombia southeast to the Guianas and Brazil. Taxonomy The southern white-fringed antwren was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux in 1775 from a specimen collected in Cayenne, French Guiana. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enlumin√©es D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Turdus griseus in his catalogue of the Planches Enlumin√©es. The southern white-fringed antwren is now placed in the genus Formicivora that was introduced by the English naturalist William Swainson in 1824. The generic name combines the Latin words formica for \\"ant\\" and -vorus \\"eating\\" from vorare \\"to devour\\". The specific epithet grisea is from the Medieval Latin griseus meaning \\"grey\\". The northern white-fringed antwren (Formicivora intermedia) was previously considered as a subspecies of the southern white- fringed antwren but is now separated as a separate species based on differences in the vocalizations. Two subspecies are recognised: * F. g. rufiventris Carriker, 1936 ‚Äì east Colombia and south Venezuela * F. g. grisea (Boddaert, 1783) ‚Äì the Guianas and east Brazil Description The southern white-fringed antwren is long, and weighs . The male has a grey-brown crown and upperparts, and black wings, tail, lower face and underparts. There are two conspicuous white wing bars and a white stripe running from above the eye down the sides of the breast and flanks. The tail feathers are tipped with white. The female's upperparts are much like the male, but females of the southern populations are orange below and have an orange supercilium. These occur south and east from southeastern Colombia and southernmost Venezuela. Northern population's females have underparts which are buff with dark streaks. It has a tu whistle followed by a trilled churet, and a repeated and accelerating tu-ik call. Southern birds also have a repetitive chump-chump- chump song, quite unlike the northern white-fringed antwren (Formicivora intermedia). Distribution and habitat This is a common and confiding bird of second growth woodland, usually found as territorial pairs. The southern populations are associated with scrubby bushes on white sandy soils and restinga habitat. These birds inhabit the lowlands, up to around 200 m ASL. In some places, they are sympatric with the rusty-backed antwren (F. rufa). The white-fringed antwren feeds on small insects and other arthropods taken from undergrowth twigs and foliage.Venturini & de Paz (2005) Behavior The female lays two purple-marked creamy white eggs, which are incubated by both sexes, in a grass hammock nest low in a tree or shrub. Nests are occasionally plundered by predators, for example smallish mammals like the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), despite the birds' attempts to defend their offspring.de Lyra-Neves et al. (2007) Of a total of 13 birds studied in Colombia‚Äîin the Parque Nacional de La Macarena and near Turbo‚Äîonly one was infected with blood parasites (an undetermined Plasmodium species).Basto et al. (2006), Londono et al. (2007) Status This bird is not considered globally threatened by the IUCN.BLI (2008) However, its resilience to human alteration of habitat is not too pronounced, and in some regions its continuing presence would seem to depend on protection of habitat.

Walker believed in the doctrine of manifest destiny, and established himself in Nicaragua in the guise of offering help, but his real intentions were to conquer the five provinces of Central America, a manifesto he entitled, \\"Five or None.\\" In Costa Rica, Juan Rafael Mora Porras, the President, was urged by and backed by the British, saw the danger of Walker's intentions and on the 27 February 1856 declared war on Nicaragua and called all Costa Ricans to join forces and fight, a call that was heeded. They began the march on the 4 March from San Jos√© to the northern border, led by the president, arriving in Liberia on the 12 March, where they joined the battalion organised there (Moracia Battalion), under the leadership of Jos√© Mar√≠a Ca√±as. When the filibusters of the Nicaraguan movement realised what was happening in Costa Rica, they organised a battalion numbering about 70 men, two out of its four companies consisted entirely of Frenchmen the other two companies consisted entirely of Germans, under the leadership of Colonel Schlessinger, which entered Costa Rica through the road that joined Nicaragua with Liberia and which passed by the Hacienda Santa Rosa, where they arrived exhausted by the long and weary march on the 20 March late at night. The Costa Ricans, meanwhile, began the walk to Santa Rosa and on the 20 March at 4 o'clock, armed with rifles, sabres, and bayonets, began the attack, surrounded the troublemakers who not having posted proper sentry were taken by surprise after having stationed themselves in the casona and in the corrals. Under the sudden attack the German company had broke and left the field, while the French under Capt. Legaye also retired from the broken ground they had attempted to occupy. In five minutes, the whole command was in disarray in full and disorderly retreat; in fourteen minutes the Costa Ricans had won the battle. Walker's troops suffered 59 killed and the Costa Ricans 20 killed. The Santa Rosa's Casona, one of the few historical sites, was burned down in May 2001 and later re-built.

With a total area of , the forest comprises over 10 separate sections. While in the westernmost sections, Custer National Forest is a part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, the easternmost sections are a combination of forest \\"islands\\" and grasslands. A portion of the forest is also part of the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness and constitutes over a third of the wilderness land. South of Red Lodge, Montana, the Beartooth Highway (U.S. 212) passes through the forest en route to Yellowstone National Park. The eastern areas are dominated by large stands of ponderosa pine surrounded by grasslands, which are often leased to local ranchers for cattle grazing. Administration Since 2014, the Custer and Gallatin National Forests are managed together as the Custer-Gallatin National Forest with headquarters in Bozeman, Montana. There are local ranger district offices located in Ashland and Red Lodge in Montana, and in Camp Crook in South Dakota for Custer, and West Yellowstone, Livingston and Gardiner in Montana for Gallatin.  Overview  The western sections have a mixture of pine, spruce and fir trees due to the increased altitude and more abundant rainfall. Higher altitudes deep into the wilderness areas are above timberline and alpine conditions prevail. The tallest mountain in Montana, Granite Peak, is shared with Gallatin National Forest, as is the interesting Grasshopper Glacier, which has millions of grasshoppers that died approximately 300 years ago, entombed within the ice. Within the forest are Native American burial grounds, pictographs and petroglyphs. For the plains Indians, the forest provided shelter and a stable food supply. Members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition are generally considered to be the first white Americans to visit the region. The forest is currently divided into three Ranger Districts: Beartooth in Red Lodge, Montana; Ashland in Ashland, Montana; and Sioux in Camp Crook, South Dakota. Four National Grasslands were formerly managed by the forest as the Grand River, Cedar River, Little Missouri and Sheyenne National Grasslands. These units are now managed as the Dakota Prairie Grasslands, headquartered in Bismarck, ND. There are over 30 vehicle accessible campgrounds in the forest, as well as numerous picnic areas. Over 1,500 miles (2,400 km) of hiking trails are available with most being found in the western district. Though not plentiful with rivers and lakes, the waterways do provide some opportunities for fishing but little for boating. The forest headquarters is located in Billings, Montana, and most hiking and camping is done in the region south and southwest of Billings. There are local ranger district offices in Ashland and Red Lodge in Montana, and in Camp Crook in South Dakota.USFS Ranger Districts by State In descending order of land area the forest is located in parts of Powder River, Carbon, Stillwater, Rosebud, Carter, Sweet Grass, Harding (the only county in South Dakota), and Park counties. Only about 6.2% of the acreage lies in South Dakota. Wildlife A relatively rare type of small falcon known as the merlin is found here in greater concentrations than anywhere else in the United States. Mammalian species of coyote, bighorn sheep, marmot, mule deer, wolf packs, grizzly bear, moose, bobcat, pronghorn, cougar, mountain goat, black bear, elk, and bison. History Custer National Forest was established by the U.S. Forest Service as Otter National Forest on March 2, 1907. On July 1, 1908 the name was changed to Custer. On January 13, 1920 the entire Sioux National Forest was added, which now comprises the Sioux Ranger District of Custer, extending into South Dakota. Sioux had previously absorbed Cave Hills, Ekalaka, Long Pine, Short Pine and Slim Buttes National Forests on July 1, 1908. On February 17, 1932 Custer absorbed a portion of Beartooth National Forest, which now comprises the Beartooth District.

The imposing structure is located approximately south of the city of Cap-Ha√Øtien, southwest of the Three Bays Protected Area, and uphill from the town of Milot. Commissioned by Haitian revolutionary Henri Christophe, and built by tens of thousands of former slaves, the Citadelle was the linchpin of the newly independent Haiti's defensive strategy against potential French incursion. Including several smaller forts across the country, the stronghold remains the only African- derived military fortification in the New World as well as the first example of African-derived colonial architecture; which it shares with Sans-Souci Palace, also commissioned by Christophe. Designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1982‚Äîalong with the aforementioned Sans-Souci, the fortress is universally regarded as an icon of the Caribbean nation. History Walls of the citadel. Commissioned in 1805 by Henri Christophe and completed in 1820, the fortress was built as part of a system of fortifications designed to thwart potential foreign incursions; notably the French. During the stronghold's conceptual phase, Christophe was a general in the Haitian army and chief administrator of the country's northern regions. The ensuing power struggle he had with his rival and fellow revolutionary Alexandre P√©tion, would result in his self-declaration as king of Northern Haiti in 1811. The Citadelle; constructed by over 20,000 ex-slaves, was built several kilometres inland atop the Bonnet a L‚ÄôEveque mountain, as a means of providing the optimal military vantage point. The location enabled Haitian forces to strategically keep watch over a vast distance, from the nearby valleys to the coastline. Cap-Ha√Øtien and the adjoining Atlantic Ocean are visible from the roof of the fortress. It is the largest fortress in the Western Hemisphere continuing to serve as a symbol of Haitian independence.https://usicomos.org/haiti-conservation-and-reconstruction- efforts/ The Haitians outfitted the fortress with 365 cannons of varying size, assembled from the abandoned munitions left behind by the European forces that formerly occupied the island. The enormous stockpiles of cannonballs still sit in pyramidal stacks at the base of the fortress walls. Since its construction, the fortress has withstood numerous earthquakes, though a French attack never came and it was eventually abandoned. View from the walls. In the event of an invasion, Christophe planned to have his military burn the valuable crops and food stocks along the coast, then retreat to the fortress, setting ambushes along the sole mountain path leading to the Citadelle. Christophe suffered a stroke in 1820, and some of his troops mutinied. Shortly afterwards, he committed suicide‚Äîaccording to legend, by shooting himself with a silver bullet.Monfried, Walter, \\"The Slave Who Became King: Henri Christophe\\", Negro Digest, Volume XII, Number 12, October, 1963. Loyal followers covered his body in quicklime and entombed it in one of the Citadelle's interior courtyards to prevent others from mutilating the corpse. Description The colossal physical dimensions of the fortress have made it a Haitian national symbol, featured on currency, stamps, and tourist ministry posters. The fortress walls rise from the mountaintop and the entire complex, including cannonball stocks but excluding the surrounding grounds, covers an area of . Workers laid the large foundation stones of the fortress directly into the stone of the mountaintop, using a mortar mixture that included quicklime, molasses, and the blood of local cows and goats‚Äîand cows hooves that they cooked to a glue and added to the mix to give the mortar added strength and bonding power. Cannonball stockpiles, viewed from the roof Citadelle Laferri√®re aerial view from a US Army UH-60 Black Hawk during Operation Unified Response Large cisterns and storehouses in the fortress's interior were designed to store enough food and water for 5,000 defenders for up to one year. The fortress included palace quarters for the king and his family, in the event that they needed to take refuge within its walls. Other facilities included dungeons, bathing quarters, and bakery ovens. Also visible is the tomb of Christophe's brother-in-law, killed when the gunpowder room he was in exploded. The Citadelle's appearance from the trail leading up to its base has been likened to the prow of a great stone ship, jutting out from the mountainside. The structure is angular and assumes different geometric forms based on the viewer's orientation. Some of the angles on the Citadelle were intentionally put there by Christophe to deviate cannonballs if attacked and the Epaulette is a great example of using angles to deviate and deflect shots. Though most of the fortress has no roof as such (the interior top is a latticework of stone walkways), some slanted portions are adorned with bright red tiles. The fortress has been repaired and refurnished several times since its construction, including in the 1980s with help from UNESCO and the World Monuments Fund, though little of it has been replaced and its design remains the same. Tourism The Citadelle is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Haiti. Directions to and history of the fortress are provided by self-appointed guides from the town of Milot. Near the entrance to Sans- Souci Palace, which is at the start of the trail to the Citadelle, visitors may be asked to pay a small fee. Visitors are also encouraged to rent a horse for the uphill trek. The first portion of the 11 kilometre (7 mi) trail is navigable by 4WD vehicle, although infrequent landslides and construction projects sometimes make this unreliable. Numerous people live along the trail and sell souvenirs or drinks, such as fresh coconut juice, to travelers. Drinks are a necessity in the tropical heat. The trail is paved stone, generally smooth and in good condition. About three-quarters of the way up from the parking lot, visitors must complete the final portion on horseback or on foot. The entire 11-kilometre (7 mi) trail, starting in Milot, is almost completely uphill, but can be walked by experienced hikers who carry plenty of water. Most of the interior of the Citadelle fortress itself is accessible to visitors, who may also climb the numerous staircases to the fortress's roof, which is free of guardrails. On a clear day, the city of Cap-Ha√Øtien and the Atlantic Ocean can be seen to the north. Because of its elevation the top of the Citadelle is used by United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) for a Radio repeater, with an antenna on the highest point. Though the turbulent political situation in Haiti (principally in the central region) has deterred visitors in recent years, the regions of the north and south of the country remain largely peaceful, making travel to the Citadel less challenging or hazardous than travel within the Haitian capital, Port-au- Prince.

Adorno and others to measure the authoritarian personality. The \\"F\\" stands for \\"fascist\\". The F-scale measures responses on several different components of authoritarianism, such as conventionalism, authoritarian aggression, anti- intraception, superstition and stereotypy, power and \\"toughness,\\" destructiveness and cynicism, projectivity, and sex.http://www.anesi.com/fscale.htm Scores acquired from the F-scale could be directly associated with background components, educational level, and intellectual capacity. It is an indirect type of test that ensures the result would not be due to the individual's fake responses; this is possible because the purpose of the measurement and which attitude is being measured are initially concealed from the participants. The existence of this correlation could possibly affect the way in which the F-scale accurately measures the authoritarian personality syndrome. The F-Test has two principal purposes: it aims to measure prejudice and anti-democratic tendencies at the personality level. The purpose of the F-scale is to measure an antidemocratic personality structure, usually defined by authoritarianism. A score of above 80 on the F-scale test indicates that the subject may be suffering from severe psychopathology. Patients who suffer from repeated episodes of disorders usually get a higher F-scale score than those who have acute disorders. Research has not found any correlation between F-scale scores and educational level. The scale specifically examines the following personality dimensions: * Conventionalism: conformity to the traditional societal norms and values of the middle class; * Authoritarian submission: a passive notion towards adhering to conventional norms and values; * Authoritarian aggression: punishing and condemning individuals who don‚Äôt adhere to conventional values; * Religion and Ethics; * Superstition * Power and \\"toughness\\"; * Anti- intraception, i.e. \\"rejection of all inwardness, of the subjective, the imaginative, the tender-minded, and of self-criticism\\"; and F-scale tests measure not only the subject's overall level of stress but also his or her willingness to cooperate in the testing process. Early research Research in the late 1960s focused on police and the detection of authoritarianism. Doubt about its indirect measure According to data presented by Baljeet Ahmed Muhammad, a hypothesis was formed proposing that brighter people are capable of penetrating the significance of the F scale, helping them react in a more ‚Äúsuitable‚Äù fashion. Hence, because the F scale can be faked, it cannot be considered as an indirect measure. In the course of the Minnesota Adoption Study it was found that \\"the F-Scale scores were negatively correlated with WAIS vocabulary [an IQ test] (-0.42) and showed the same pattern of family correlations\\". Criticism The scale has attracted a great deal of criticism, since it is ideological and associates societal processes with personality characteristics. Among the criticisms of the F-scale is its sensitivity to respondents with acquiescent response styles due to being worded so that agreement always indicated an authoritarian response. A number of related scales such as the Wilson-Patterson Conservatism Scale and the Balanced F-scale have been created in an attempt to fix the shortcomings of the F-scale. Bob Altemeyer's Right-wing authoritarianism Scale is the most frequently used, contemporary descendant of the F-scale. Another criticism of the test is the assumption that users with a high score are unsophisticated and may lack social intelligence. According to Kelman and Barclay (1963), the experience of the participant is reflected on the test score; i.e., they may not be able to see the obvious pattern and motives recurring in the test and be ignorant of it.

Background and political career  As a child, he grew up in a military family and after graduating University of Notre Dame on a full ROTC scholarship, he joined the United States Army and rose to the rank of Captain as a helicopter pilot. In 1982, he left the military to join the family business in Silicon Valley. He was elected as a Republican to the California Assembly in 1986. In 1994 he was elected insurance commissioner, effectively applying considerable campaign contributions from various insurance companies.Article: Insurers contribute heavily to Quackenbush's campaign...

At this point, Quackenbush was considered the most promising Republican elected official in the state of California.  Resignation  :Note: For a timeline of the events associated with this section seeThe Downfall of California's Insurance Commissioner (Insurance Journal) In early 2000, Cindy Ossias, then a senior lawyer for the California Department of Insurance (CDI), charged the Department with corruption. According to testimony by CDI employees, including Ossias and staff attorney Robert Hagedorn, Commissioner Quackenbush and his top aides abused their positions for personal gain and acted against consumers' interests for many years. After the 1994 Northridge earthquake, it was alleged that Quackenbush allowed insurance companies to compensate their clients much less than the actual damages. In exchange, the insurance companies set up special \\"educational funds\\". Those funds were used to create television commercials in which Quackenbush appeared as a basketball referee with Shaquille O'Neal in a Los Angeles Lakers uniform. While couched as public service announcements, suspicions rose that main idea behind the commercials was to increase Quackenbush's name identification, which is critical for electoral success in California statewide races. In addition to the educational funds, those same insurance companies contributed to his wife's unsuccessful 1998 assembly campaign, as well as his children's football camps. Initially, Cindy Ossias blew the whistle as an anonymous source. When her identity was revealed, Quackenbush put her on an administrative leave for violation of attorney client privilege. On June 28, 2000, he announced his resignation (to become effective on July 10). In February 2002, an 18-month investigation conducted by federal, state and Sacramento County prosecutors ended with prosecutors declining to press charges against Quackenbush, as they felt the evidence was not strong enough.Former Calif. Insurance Commissioner Won't Face Federal Charges (Insurance Journal West)  Life after insurance commissioner  After resigning as California's insurance commissioner, Quackenbush moved to Hawaii, where he was \\"doing political and military intelligence consulting\\". Quackenbush then moved to Florida and in 2005 became a sheriff's deputy in Lee County, Florida. In 2007 he was suspended for accepting free food. While working as a sheriff's deputy in February 2008, Quackenbush shot and critically wounded a suspect who was reported as resisting arrest. He was placed on paid leave during the investigation of the shooting. In September 2016, he was forced to resign, after making several racially controversial Facebook postings. At the time of his resignation from the Sheriff Department, he also served as the vice chair of the Lee County Republican Executive Committee and his wife was running for the Lee County school board.

It is located on the southern bank of the Orange River mouth. It was named for Sir James Alexander, who was the first person to map the area whilst on a Royal Geographical Society expedition into Namibia in 1836. (It is mistakenly believed by many locals that it was he who first established commercial copper mining in the area.) With diamonds being discovered along the West Coast in 1925, Alexander Bay was established to service the mining industry. The town of Oranjemund lies on the northern bank of the river, which forms the international border with Namibia. The two towns are linked by the Sir Ernest Oppenheimer Bridge, named for Ernest Oppenheimer in 1951. The town is served by Alexander Bay Airport. History=Diamonds= After diamonds were discovered along this coast in 1925 by Dr Hans Merensky, Alexander Bay became known for its mining activities. The resulting diamond rush led to the Diamond Coast rebellion of 1928. =Copper= Copper ore was shipped through the Richtersveld in barges down the Orange River for export from this bay. The town was a high security area and permits were needed when entered. It is no longer a high security area and no permits are needed. Geography and climate Alexander Bay is the most northerly situated town along the west coastline of South Africa. The Orange River enters the Atlantic Ocean at Alexander Bay. The Orange River wetland forms the border between South Africa and Namibia. The Orange River wetland is a declared Ramsar site. Fields of green and orange lichen grow on a hill near the turnoff to Alexander Bay town. It is north-west of Springbok, the administrative centre of Namaqualand. Being near the southern end of the Namib desert, it is officially also the driest town in South Africa with an average annual rainfall of less than . The cold Benguela Current in the Atlantic Ocean has a moderating influence on the coastal climate with only small variations in diurnal and seasonal temperatures.

The city is a popular holiday and conference centre and the administrative and commercial hub and the capital city of the Garden Route. The city is situated roughly halfway between Cape Town and Port Elizabeth on the Garden Route.. It is situated on a 10-kilometre plateau between the Outeniqua Mountains to the north and the Indian Ocean to the south. The former township of Pacaltsdorp, now a fully incorporated suburb, lies to the south.  History = 18th and 19th century = The city of George was established as a result of the growing demand for timber and the wood used in building, transport and furniture. In 1776 the Dutch East India Company established an outpost for the provision of timber; its location is thought to be near the western end of York Street. The Timber Post had its own Poshouer (manager), some 12 woodcutters, a blacksmith, wagon maker and 200 oxen plus families. After 1795 and the British occupation of the Cape, a caretaker of the forests in the area was appointed. After the second British occupation in 1806, it was decided that the Swellendam magistracy was too large and needed to be sub- divided. George was chosen because of the availability of good water. In 1811 George was declared a separate district and Tiaan Swart was appointed the first Landrost (magistrate) and the town was proclaimed by the Earl of Caledon, governor of the Cape Colony on St George's Day, 23 April 1811, and named after the reigning British monarch, King George III. One of Van Kervel's first acts as Landrost (Mayor), was to dig a furrow to supply the first thirty six plots in George with water. An 1819 map shows the original furrows and storage dam where they remain to this day in the Garden Route Botanical Gardens. The first Furrow originated from the Rooirivier (Red river) and later a diversionary weir was built at the Camphersdrift River. George gained municipal status in 1837. From 1772 there was a gradual influx of settlers intent on making a living from the forests. These were mostly descendants of the Dutch settlers. In early days the lives and livelihood of the people revolved around the timber industry and the rich forests in the vicinity and it remained a quiet outpost. It was the dramatic improvement of communications ‚Äì the roads, rail and air links eclipsing the ox-wagons and coastal steamers of the 19th century - that exposed other charms and resources of the region and resulted in unprecedented growth for the town. = Woodcutters: 1900‚Äì1940 = After the ostrich feather slump and a severe drought in the Karoo during the early part of the 18th century, many \\"bywoners\\" found themselves without work. Rather than stay in an arid region they crossed the mountains to find a livelihood in the forests. Forest settlements, such as Karatara and Bergplaas (1922) were started and many of the \\"dangerous\\" working-class people from the Transvaal were moved to these settlements. They were, however, a minority group, as most of the woodcutters lived outside these settlements. A small number were descendants of British immigrants who could find no other means of livelihood. There were also a small number of Italian immigrants who had been brought to the area from Turin in 1879, as part of a scheme to start a silk industry in the Knysna area. It turned out to be a complete failure due to the lack of mulberry leaves. Finding themselves without work some of these Italians drifted into the forests and joined the woodcutting community. Sons were considered to be an economic asset as, at the age of around 14 or 15, after very little schooling, they could assist their fathers in the forest. The majority of these sons eventually became woodcutters themselves. The Forest Act of 1913 required all woodcutters to be registered. In 1939 all remaining woodcutters were removed from the forests and given a government pension. = Timber industry = From the beginning of European colonisation in South Africa in 1652, timber and the provision of various woods was of paramount importance for the survival of the settlers. Once forest areas near the present Cape Town were exhausted, the search for more timber continued along the coast. The great forests of the Southern Cape were discovered as early as 1711, but because of their inaccessibility it was only in 1776 that the Dutch East India Company established a timber post where George is today. Early woodcutters and their families lived in forest clearings where they evolved into a closely knit community where intermarriage was common. The men were thin and wiry, but they were also tough and strong with an incredible skill in felling, sawing and handling timber. The utilization of the forest trees led to such industries as furniture and wagon making. By 1910 several large sawmills had been established in the district. Timber for export was transported to coastal ports by ox wagon. Today you will find sawmills with the ultimate in modern wood technology and innovative furniture factories in the Southern Cape. Unique to this area is the age-old technique and skill of manufacturing wood furniture by hand. = Historic background of the George Museum = What the visitor sees in the George museum today has grown from the private collections of one man, Charles Sayers. He was the owner and long-time editor of the George & Knysna Herald, a newspaper established by his parents in 1881. Sayers collected and preserved all aspects of his hometown's history, with a specialist interest in old mechanical musical instruments and typewriters which today form the nucleus of the museum's important collections. In 1966 he opened his \\"Mini Museum\\" to the public, housed in a single room adjoining a caf√© in Courtenay Street. The people loved it and much encouraged by local authorities he moved to the original George Town House ‚Äì the administrative building next to the market square which dated back to 1847. By now the Sayers Museum had attracted the attention of officialdom and barely six months after the move it attained provincial museum status as a fully-fledged cultural history museum for the region, with indigenous timber and its allied industries as its main theme. The growing popularity led to another move, this time to the building, which had been the original drostdy (magistrate's residence and office) in the young town. The original \\"Mini Museum\\" has been re-created within the present George Museum. George is also the home town of the famous Adre Le Roux, who drove out the Portuguese and lay claim to the land that was rightfully hers. = Outeniqua Mountain = In 1668 the first European explorer, Hieronymous Cruse, penetrated Outeniqualand with its dense indigenous forest. The highest peak in the Outeniquas is Cradock Peak (1578 m) and the prominent George Peak is 1337 metres high. The name Outeniqua is derived from the Khoi word meaning \\"man laden with honey\\". The slopes of the emerald-green mountains were covered with heather and swarming with bees, according to the reports left by early travellers. \\"Nature has made an enchanting abode of this beautiful place\\", wrote the 18th century traveller Le Vaillant, when he entered the foothills of the Outeniqua range in the Southern Cape. A great deal of that enchantment and delicate beauty still captivates the modern traveller. For instance, there is the rare George lily (Cyrtanthus elatusCyrtanthus elatus), found near water in the deep ravines of the mountain, and a variety of ericas and proteas thrive on the fern-clothed slopes. Carpets of pink watsonias are a common sight during summer. = Montagu Pass = Montagu Pass The historic Montagu Pass between George and Oudtshoorn was declared a National Monument in 1972. It is open to traffic and is a good gravel road, some 10 km in length. With many serpentine curves, this pass gradually winds its way through the fynbos-covered Cradock's Kloof until it reaches the summit. The world traveller Anthony Trollope visited George in about 1878 and his comment on the Montagu Pass was: \\"...equal to some of the mountain roads through the Pyrenees\\". Emma Murray was so enthralled by the Montagu Pass that she wrote in a letter to a relative in 1852: \\"One forgets everything in the beauty and grandeur of the scene. It was to me exquisite enjoyment\\". A traveller will notice that some parts of the stone wall along one side of the road are slightly protruding. The purpose of this was to prevent the axles of the wagons from scraping against the walls and thus becoming damaged. = The building of the Montagu Pass = The Civil Commissioner of George, Egbertus Bergh (1837‚Äì1843), campaigned tirelessly for a new road through the formidable Outeniqua Mountains to replace the notorious Cradock's Pass. Then came John Montagu, the new dynamic Colonial Secretary, who cleared the public debt, recognised the importance of good roads and set the wheels rolling. Work on the pass commenced in 1844 and H.O. Farrel was appointed superintendent of the project, but the task was beyond his ability. Henry Fancourt White, a qualified surveyor, newly appointed as Road Inspector by the Central Road Board, replaced him in 1845. On average, 250 convicts were employed at any given time on the construction of the pass. They were housed in two camps: South Station, remnants of the old brick chimneys can be seen on your right whilst going up the Outeniqua pass just before the 2nd Montagu Pass turn off, and North Station near the summit of the pass. The headquarters for the construction was sited where Blanco is situated today. The total expenses for the construction of the Montagu Pass amounted to ¬£35,799 of which ¬£1,753 was spent on gunpowder. Five and a half miles of the pass had to be blasted out of solid rock. = Railway over the mountains = The building of the railway line over the Outeniqua Mountains, between George and Oudtshoorn began in December 1908 from the George side and in 1911 from the Oudtshoorn side. The track was blasted out of the rock, and seven tunnels were excavated. At one stage some 2 500 workers were employed. During April 1913 this most scenic railway line was completed. Sir David de Villiers Graaff performed the official opening on 6 August 1913. The line was built at the enormous cost of ¬£465 000. = Toll House = During the construction of the Montagu Pass, in about 1847, a stone toll house, with a thatched roof, was erected on the George side of the mountain. According to a proclamation in the Government Gazette of 24 February 1848, a toll gate was set up, and a tariff of tolls publicised. Upon payment of the prescribed fee the toll keeper would raise the bar across the road to enable the vehicle or animal to pass. The first toll- keeper was John Kirk Smith, born in Nottingham, England in 1818. During 1849 he collected the amount of ¬£400.13.8p in toll fees. His son William Kirk Smith was appointed toll-keeper in 1880. William and his son made \\"veldt schoens\\" (simple leather shoes) at the toll-house for sale to travellers and transport riders. Soon they had a thriving business and J.K. Smith, grandson of the first toll-keeper, expanded this concern to Market Street in George. From this humble beginning grew the large and flourishing shoe industry J.K. Smith and Company, which was the forerunner of Modern Shoes Ltd. Other early toll- keepers were James Scott (1852) and Charles Searle (1858). The toll-house caught fire on 23 July 1855 and the entire roof was destroyed, later being replaced with corrugated iron. In the Government Gazette dated 16 July 1867, the toll-tariffs were: Each wheel of a vehicle ‚Äì two pence; Animal drawing a vehicle ‚Äì one penny; Animal not drawing a vehicle ‚Äì two pence; Sheep, goat or pig ‚Äì one halfpenny. All tolls were abolished on 31 December 1918, but thanks to the fact that it was declared a National Monument in 1970, this interesting relic of the last century has been saved for posterity. = Blanco = Henry Fancourt White, enchanted by Outeniqualand, bought a portion of the farm Modder River in 1848. He sold a portion to Frances Cook, who named his farm Oaklands, and subdivided the rest into erven. The little village was called \\"Whitesville\\" in honour of Henry Fancourt White, but at his suggestion the name was changed to Blanco, the Spanish term for white. In 1859 Henry White built a beautiful double storey thatched mansion, which he named Blanco House. In 1903 his son Ernest Montagu White renamed the house Fancourt ‚Äì in honour of his father. Today Fancourt is a National Monument and a well-known hotel. The main route from Mossel Bay to the Langkloof passed through Blanco, where a settlement of merchants was soon established. The village was also the main postal centre. This caused dissatisfaction among the businessmen of George, and so a direct link from George to the toll-house was built in about 1882. This road was called Bain's Trace and was probably built by Thomas Bain, who surveyed the new route. = The Lake System = The lakes originated about 20 000 years ago during the Late Pleistocene at the end of the last era of ice ages which was largely centred in the Northern Hemisphere. Consequently, these lakes can be regarded as geologically relatively young. During that last glacial period, the sea-level dropped to about 130 m lower than at present as a result of the accumulation of ice in the Northern Hemisphere. Rivers then extended into the newly exposed coastal areas, cutting deep valleys into them. At the end of the last glacial period the sea-level rose again, drowning these newly formed valleys until, after a last slight rise and fall of sea-level, a level of about one to three metres above the present level was reached some 6 000 years ago. The sea level then slowly receded to reach the present level about 4 000 years ago. The partial draining of these valleys exposed part of the coastal area, thereby forming all the present Wilderness Lakes except for Langvlei and Rondevlei. Martin (1962) postulates the Langvlei could have been formed by wave erosion preceding the last rise in sea level while Rondevlei, during the same time, probably originated as a wind-deflating basin. Ruigtevlei, to the east of Swartvlei, was a lake that disappeared, leaving a large area that is only inundated after floods (Martin, 1960a). During this last change (drop) in sea level, the mouth of Swartvlei Estuary moved 2 km eastward to the present position at Sedgefield, Groenvlei lost its connection to the sea through the Swartvlei Estuary, and sand dunes now effectively covered any traces of a previous connection to the sea.  Climate  George has an oceanic climate, with warm summers, and mild to chilly winters. It is one of the highest rainfall regions in South Africa. Most rain falls in the winter and spring months, brought by the humid sea winds from the Indian Ocean.  Demographics  The 2001 Census divided the urban area of George into four \\"main places\\": George proper, population 68,557; Thembalethu, population 31,999; Pacaltsdorp, population 18,285; and Lawaaikamp, population 2,458. This gives a total population of 121,299 in the urban area. 51.2% of these people were female and 48.8% were male. Of the total urban population, 49.5% described themselves as Coloured, 29.3% as \\"Black African\\", 20.9% as \\"White\\", and 0.3% as \\"Indian or Asian\\". 65.4% spoke Afrikaans as their home language, 26.9% spoke Xhosa, 6.9% spoke English, and 0.9% spoke some other language.  Attractions  Southern right whale breaches off the coast George has a sophisticated infrastructure with banks, conference facilities, businesses and shopping centres including the Garden Route Mall and Eden Meander, transport and sporting facilities, yet retains its small town atmosphere. The city is also a major accommodation centre. George has numerous world-class golf courses, some designed by famous golfers. The most well-known is Fancourt Golf Estate, which hosted the Presidents Cup in 2003 and is often the host to high-profile golf tournaments. Every December through 2010, top national rugby sevens teams from around the world came to Outeniqua Park for the South Africa Sevens, one of the tournaments in the IRB Sevens World Series. However, the tournament was moved to Port Elizabeth. December 2015 the Tournament was moved to the Green Point stadium in Cape Town. George has many historical landmarks: *The Slave Tree, an ancient English oak planted by Landdrost (magistrate) van Kervel, known as the Slave Tree because of the very large chain and lock embedded in the trunk, has been declared a national monument. *The King Edward VII Library building, said to be the best example of Edwardian architecture in George. The First Class School for girls was started by Miss Christina Petronella van Niekerk, a \\"New Age\\" young lady with visions for the future which were very different from those ideas held by the conservative population of George. George is often used a base to explore Tsitsikamma National Park. Outeniqua Choo Tjoe The Outeniqua Choo Tjoe was South Africa's last scheduled mixed steam train service and operated on the Outeniqualand Preserved Railway between George and Knysna on the Garden Route. Opened in 1928 and declared a preserved line in July 1993, this train winds its way through picturesque scenery. However, after a landslide disrupted operations in 2007 service was maintained on the section between George, Hartenbos and Mossel Bay. In 2010 Transnet, the South African railway authority, decided to discontinue all operations of the Choo-Tjoe train. The Outeniqua Transport Museum houses a large collection of steam locomotives and carriages. The Garden Route Botanical Garden is situated the top of Caledon Street.The Garden Route boasts the largest continuous natural forest area in South Africa, covering some 650 km2. Marketable timber is harvested from 20% of the State forest. Stinkwood, named for its unmistakable odour when freshly cut, is highly prized by the furniture industry, as are white pear, hard pear, ironwood and assegaai. The most sought after timber is the outeniqua yellowwood (Podocarpus falcatus).

A total of 80 cars were on show and food stalls were provided by the George Lions Club. The 2nd show was held at the George Riding Club in 1998 and approximately 250 cars and tractors were on show. The new car dealers were invited to display their latest models and the show was well supported by the public. Various displays like dog shows, gymnastics, a horse parade and a drive-by so that clubs could show off their cars, entertained the public. Arts in the park and food stalls as well as a well-stocked beer garden entertained those who were tired of looking at cars. A model car show was also laid on. The George Old Car Show was held at the riding club until 2000 when it once again ran out of space and had to seek larger grounds. The 4th George Old Car Show was moved to the P.W. Botha College in York Street, George. Ample space for show cars, tractors and motorcycles was available on the site as well as large grounds for public parking. The hostels are available for accommodation to exhibitors and a full-time arena program held the public's attention. The school provided food stalls and the income benefited the school fund. The 8th [lGeorge Old Car Show was held in February 2004 and was by then rated as the 2nd largest motor show in South Africa and was supported by CAR Magazine. A total of 750 cars dated from 1901 to the latest models were on show. Forty restored tractors and a large variety of motorcycles were on show. The model car show proved to be more popular than ever and more than 5000 models were on display and for sale. The \\"arts in the park\\" had also evolved into a show of its own. Various motor clubs were in attendance. As this is not a static show all clubs had the opportunity to take part in the drive-by.

Many Christian denominations consider the interpretations and doctrines of Jehovah's Witnesses to be heretical, and some professors of religion have described the group as a cult. According to law professor Archibald Cox, in the United States, Jehovah's Witnesses were \\"the principal victims of religious persecution ‚Ä¶ they began to attract attention and provoke repression in the 1930s, when their proselytizing and numbers rapidly increased.\\" Political and religious animosity against Jehovah's Witnesses has at times led to mob action and government oppression in various countries, including Cuba, the United States, Canada, Singapore, and Nazi Germany. The denomination's doctrine of political neutrality has led to imprisonment of members who refused conscription (for example in Britain during World War II and afterwards during the period of compulsory national service). During the World Wars, Jehovah's Witnesses were targeted in the United States, Canada, and many other countries for their refusal to serve in the military or help with war efforts. In Canada, Jehovah's Witnesses were interned in camps along with political dissidents and people of Japanese and Chinese descent. Activities of Jehovah's Witnesses have previously been banned in the Soviet Union and in Spain, partly due to their refusal to perform military service. Their religious activities are currently banned or restricted in some countries, for example in Singapore, China, Vietnam, Russia and many Muslim-majority countries. Countries=Benin= During the first presidency of Mathieu K√©r√©kou, activities of Jehovah's Witnesses were banned and members were forced to undergo \\"demystification training.\\" =Bulgaria= In Bulgaria, Jehovah's Witnesses have been targets of violence by right wing nationalist groups such as the IMRO ‚Äì Bulgarian National Movement. On April 17, 2011, a group of about sixty hooded men carrying BMPO flags besieged a Kingdom Hall in Burgas, during the annual memorial of Christ's death. Attackers threw stones, damaged furniture, and injured at least five of the people gathered inside. The incident was recorded by a local television station. Jehovah's Witnesses in Bulgaria have been fined for proselytizing without proper government permits, and some municipalities have legislation prohibiting or restricting their rights to preach. = Canada = In 1984, Canada released a number of previously classified documents which revealed that in the 1940s, \\"able bodied young Jehovah's Witnesses\\" were sent to \\"camps\\", and \\"entire families who practiced the religion were imprisoned.\\" The 1984 report stated, \\"Recently declassified wartime documents suggest [World War II] was also a time of officially sanctioned religious bigotry, political intolerance and the suppression of ideas. The federal government described Jehovah's Witnesses as subversive and offensive 'religious zealots' ‚Ä¶ in secret reports given to special parliamentarian committees in 1942.\\" It concluded that, \\"probably no other organization is so offensive in its methods, working as it does under the guise of Christianity. The documents prepared by the justice department were presented to a special House of Commons committee by the government of William Lyon Mackenzie King in an attempt to justify the outlawing of the organizations during the second world war.\\" =China= According to Bitter Winter, an online magazine discussing religious freedom and human rights in China, Jehovah's Witnesses' activities in China are considered illegal. It also reports that foreign missionaries are deported, members' homes are raided, and members express concern about being followed by police. Bitter Winter also reported that China's official anti- cult website openly supported Russia's ban of the denomination, stating that the group should be strictly controlled or even banned. Former Canadian- American Jehovah's Witness missionary Amber Scorah recounted the lengths that she and her husband went through to preach illegally in China in the early 2000s. She reports needing to falsify their visa application to enter the country and lying to co-workers about why they immigrated there. She describes how local Jehovah's Witnesses were forced to meet secretly in a different location every week, with invites by word-of-mouth only. She also describes how they would vet potential converts to make sure they had no communist ties or leanings. =Cuba= Under Fidel Castro's communist regime, Jehovah's Witnesses were considered \\"social deviants\\", along with homosexuals, vagrants, and other groups, and were sent to forced labor concentration camps to be \\"reeducated\\". On July 1, 1974 the group was officially banned and their \\"churches\\" closed. Following the ban members who refused military service were imprisoned for sentences of three years and it was reported that members were also imprisoned because of their children's refusal to salute the flag. = Eritrea = In Eritrea, the government stripped Jehovah's Witnesses of their civil and political rights in 1994 after their refusal to engage in voting and military service. Members of all ages have been arrested for participating in religious meetings. On 24 September 1994, Paulos Eyassu, Negede Teklemariam, and Isaac Mogos were arrested, imprisoned without trial, and remain imprisoned.http://www.uscirf.gov/sites/default/files/USCIRF_AR_2016_Tier1_Eritrea.pdf As of January 2019, 53 Witnesses were imprisoned, one since 2001. International rights groups are aware of the situation of Jehovah's Witnesses in Eritrea and have repeatedly called for Eritrean authorities to end the persecution. Four are reported to have died in prison due to maltreatment. = France = Prior to World War II, the French government banned the Association of Jehovah's Witnesses in France, and ordered that the French offices of the Watch Tower Society be vacated. After the war, Jehovah's Witnesses in France renewed their operations. In December 1952, France's Minister of the Interior banned The Watchtower magazine, citing its position on military service. The ban was lifted on November 26, 1974.1976 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses\\"Announcements\\", Our Kingdom Ministry, February 1975, page 3 In the 1990s and 2000s, the French government included Jehovah's Witnesses on its list of \\"cults\\", and governmental ministers made derogatory public statements about Jehovah's Witnesses. Despite its century of activity in the country, France's Ministry of Finance opposed official recognition of the denomination; it was not until June 23, 2000 that France's highest administrative court, the Council of State, ruled that Jehovah's Witnesses qualify as a religion under French law.\\"Highest administrative court in France rules that Jehovah's Witnesses are a religion\\", News release June 23, 2000, Authorized Site of the Office of Public Information of Jehovah's Witnesses, As Retrieved 2009-08-19 France's Ministry of the Interior sought to collect 60% of donations made to the denomination's entities; Witnesses called the taxation \\"confiscatory\\" and appealed to the European Court of Human Rights. On June 30, 2011, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that France's actions violated the religious freedom of Jehovah's Witnesses by demanding 58 million euros in taxes. Jehovah's Witnesses in France have reported hundreds of criminal attacks against their adherents and places of worship. French dependencies During the ban of The Watchtower in France, publication of the magazine continued in various French territories. In French Polynesia, the magazine was covertly published under the name, La Sentinelle, though it was later learned that The Watchtower had not been banned locally. In R√©union, the magazine was published under the name, Bulletin int√©rieur.2007 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses, page 255 =Georgia= In 1996, one year after Georgia adopted its post-USSR Constitution,That is, 'the year after 1995'.

Persecution intensified following Adolf Hitler's appointment as chancellor in 1933 and continued until 1945.\\"Germany\\", 1974 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses, pages 116‚Äì117 A \\"Declaration of Facts\\" was issued at a Jehovah's Witness convention in Berlin on June 25, 1933, asserting the group's political neutrality and calling for an end to government opposition. More than 2.1 million copies of the statement were distributed throughout Germany, but its distribution prompted a new wave of persecution against German Witnesses, whose refusal to give the Hitler salute, join Nazi organizations or perform military service demonstrated their opposition to the totalitarian ideology of National Socialism. On October 4, 1934, congregations of Jehovah's Witnesses in Germany sent telegrams of protest and warning to Hitler. According to one eyewitness account Hitler was shown a number of telegrams protesting against the Third Reich's persecution of the Bible Students. The eyewitness, Karl Wittig, reported: \\"Hitler jumped to his feet and with clenched fists hysterically screamed: 'This brood will be exterminated in Germany!' Four years after this discussion I was able, by my own observations, to convince myself ‚Ä¶ that Hitler's outburst of anger was not just an idle threat. No other group of prisoners of the named concentration-camps was exposed to the sadism of the SS-soldiery in such a fashion as the Bible Students were. It was a sadism marked by an unending chain of physical and mental tortures, the likes of which no language in the world can express.\\"\\"Foreign Activities Under Fascist-Nazi Persecution\\", The Watchtower, August 1, 1955, page 462.\\"Germany\\", 1974 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses, page 138. About 10,000 Witnesses were imprisoned, including 2000 sent to concentration camps, where they were identified by purple triangles; as many as 1200 died, including 250 who were executed.. From 1935 Gestapo officers offered members a document to sign indicating renouncement of their faith, submission to state authority, and support of the German military. Historian Detlef Garbe says a \\"relatively high number\\" of people signed the statement before the war, but \\"extremely low numbers\\" of Bible Student prisoners did so in concentration camps in later years. Despite more than a century of conspicuous activity in the country, Jehovah's Witnesses in Germany were not granted legal recognition until March 25, 2005, in Berlin; in 2006 Germany's Federal Administrative Court (BVerwG) in Leipzig extended the local decision to apply nationwide.\\"Germany Federal Administrative Court Upholds Witnesses' Full Exercise of Faith\\", Authorized Site of the Office of Public Information of Jehovah's Witnesses, As Retrieved 2009-08-26 =India= Jehovah's Witnesses' Office of Public Information has documented a number of mob attacks in India. It states that these instances of violence \\"reveal the country's hostility toward its own citizens who are Christians.\\" There have been reports that police assist mob attacks on Jehovah's Witnesses or lay charges against the Witnesses while failing to charge other participants involved. In the city of Davangere on December 20, 2010 a mob confronted two female Witnesses. The mob broke into the home of one of the Witnesses where they had taken refuge. Property was damaged and one of the Witnesses was assaulted. When the police arrived, the Witnesses were arrested and charged with blasphemy. In another incident, on December 6, 2011, three Witnesses were attacked by a mob in Madikeri, in the state of Karnataka. The male Witness \\"was kicked and pummeled by the mob\\" and then the mob dragged them towards a nearby temple; while making lewd remarks, the mob \\"tried to tear the clothes off of the female Witnesses.\\" According to the report, the police came and \\"took the three Witnesses to the police station and filed charges against them rather than the mob.\\"\\"Violence against Jehovah's Witnesses in India escalates as police assist mob attacks\\", Authorized Site of the Office of Public Information of Jehovah's Witnesses, During a July 2012 incident, a group of fifteen men assaulted four Witnesses in Madikeri. The group was taken to a police station and charged with \\"insulting the religion or religious beliefs of another class\\" before being released on bail. =Malawi= In 1967, thousands of Witnesses in Malawi were beaten and killed by police and citizens for refusing to purchase political party cards and become members of the Malawi Congress Party. While their stand of not involving themselves in politics during the time of the old Colonial government was seen as an act of resistance their continued non- involvement with the new independent government was viewed as treasonous. The organization was declared illegal in the penal code and the foreign members in the country were expelled. Persecution, both economic and physical, was intensified after a September 1972 Malawi Congress Party meeting which stated, in part, that \\"all Witnesses should be dismissed from their employment; any firm that failed to comply would have its license cancelled.\\" By November 1973 some 21,000 Jehovah's Witnesses had fled to the neighboring country of Zambia. In 1993, during the transition to a multiparty system and a change in leadership, the government's ban on the organization was lifted in the country. = Russian Federation = Russian anti-extremism laws were extended to non-violent groups in 2007 and Jehovah's Witnesses have been officially banned from the port city of Taganrog since 2009, after a local court ruled the organization guilty of inciting religious hatred by \\"propagating the exclusivity and supremacy\\" of their religious beliefs. On December 8, 2009 the Supreme Court of Russia upheld the ruling of the lower courts which pronounced 34 pieces of Jehovah's Witness literature extremist, including their magazine The Watchtower, in the Russian language. Jehovah's Witnesses claim that this ruling affirms a misapplication of a federal law on anti-extremism. The ruling upheld the confiscation of property of Jehovah's Witnesses in Taganrog, and may set a precedent for similar cases in other areas of Russia, as well as placing literature of Jehovah's Witnesses on a list of literature unacceptable throughout Russia. The chairman of the presiding committee of the Administrative Center of Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia, Vasily Kalin, said: \\"I am very concerned that this decision will open a new era of opposition against Jehovah's Witnesses, whose right to meet in peace, to access religious literature and to share the Christian hope contained in the Gospels, is more and more limited.\\"http://www.osce.org/odihr/94547?download=true On December 1, 2015 a Rostov Regional Court convicted 16 Jehovah's Witnesses of practising extremism in Taganrog, with five given -year suspended sentences and the remainder issued fines they were not required to pay. On May 5, 2015, customs authorities in Russia seized a shipment of religious literature containing Ossetian-language Bibles published by Jehovah's Witnesses. Russian customs officials in the city of Vyborg held up a shipment of 2,013 Russian-language copies of Bibles on July 13, 2015. Customs authorities confiscated three of the Bibles, sent them to an \\"expert\\" to study the Bibles to determine whether they contained \\"extremist\\" language, and impounded the rest of the shipment. On July 21, 2015, the Russian Federation Ministry of Justice added Jehovah's Witnesses' official website to the Federal List of Extremist Materials thereby making it a criminal offense to promote the website from within the country and requiring internet providers throughout Russia to block access to the site. On March 23, 2017, the Russian News Agency TASS reported that Russia's Justice Ministry had suspended the activities of the Administrative Center of Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia due to extremist activities. On April 4, 2017 UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression David Kaye, UN Special Rapporteur on Freedoms of Peaceful Assembly and Association Maina Kiai, and UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion and Belief Ahmed Shaheed condemned Russia's desire to ban Jehovah's Witnesses. On April 20, 2017, The Supreme Court of Russia issued a verdict upholding the claim from the country's Justice Ministry that Jehovah's Witnesses' activity violated laws on \\"extremism.\\" The ruling liquidates the group's Russian headquarters in St. Petersburg and all of its 395 local religious organizations. Thus banning their activity, and ordering their property to be seized by the state. This is the first time that a court has ruled that a registered national centralized religious organisation is \\"extremist\\" and banned. Many countries and international organizations have spoken out against Russia's religious abuses of Jehovah's Witnesses. Leaders of various denominations have also spoken out against Russia's decision to ban Jehovah's Witnesses. An article in Newsweek stated, \\"Russia's decision to ban Jehovah's Witnesses in the country shows the 'paranoia' of Vladimir Putin's government, according to the chair of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF).\\" The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum also expressed deep concern over Russia's treatment of Jehovah's Witnesses. In May 2017, armed Federal Security Services (FSB) officers arrested Dennis Christensen, a 46 year old Danish citizen, at a hall in Oryol on charges related to extremism. On February 6, 2019, he was found guilty and sentenced to six years in prison. =Singapore= In 1972 the Singapore government de-registered and banned the activities of Jehovah's Witnesses on the grounds that its members refuse to perform military service (which is obligatory for all male citizens), salute the flag, or swear oaths of allegiance to the state.\\"Singapore\\", International Religious Freedom Report 2004, U. S. Department of State, As Retrieved 2010-03-11 Singapore has banned all written materials (including Bibles) published by the International Bible Students Association and the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, both publishing arms of the Jehovah's Witnesses. A person in possession of banned literature can be fined up to S$2,000 (US$1,333) and jailed up to 12 months for a first conviction. In February 1995, Singapore police raided private homes where group members were holding religious meetings, in an operation codenamed \\"Operation Hope\\". Officers seized Bibles, religious literature, documents and computers, and eventually brought charges against 69 Jehovah's Witnesses, many of whom went to jail. In March 1995, 74-year-old Yu Nguk Ding was arrested for carrying two \\"undesirable publications\\"‚Äîone of them a Bible printed by the Watch Tower Society. In 1996, eighteen Jehovah's Witnesses were convicted for unlawfully meeting in a Singapore apartment and were given sentences from one to four weeks in jail. Canadian Queen's Counsel Glen How flew to Singapore to defend the Jehovah's Witnesses and argued that the restrictions against the Jehovah's Witnesses violated their constitutional rights. Then-Chief Justice Yong Pung How questioned How's sanity, accused him of \\"living in a cartoon world\\" and referred to \\"funny, cranky religious groups\\" before denying the appeal. In 1998, two Jehovah's Witnesses were charged in a Singapore court for possessing and distributing banned religious publications. In 1998 a Jehovah's Witness lost a lawsuit against a government school for wrongful dismissal for refusing to sing the national anthem or salute the flag. In March 1999, the Court of Appeals denied his appeal. In 2000, public secondary schools indefinitely suspended at least fifteen Jehovah's Witness students for refusing to sing the national anthem or participate in the flag ceremony. In April 2001, one public school teacher, also a member of Jehovah's Witnesses, resigned after being threatened with dismissal for refusing to participate in singing the national anthem. Singapore authorities have seized Jehovah's Witnesses' literature on various occasions from individuals attempting to cross the Malaysia‚ÄìSingapore border. In thirteen cases, authorities warned the Jehovah's Witnesses, but did not press charges. As of January 2019, there were 9 members of Jehovah's Witnesses incarcerated for refusal to carry out mandatory military service. The initial sentence for failure to comply is 15 months' imprisonment, with an additional 24 months for a second refusal. Failure to perform annual military reserve duty, which is required of all those who have completed their initial two-year obligation, results in a 40-day sentence, with a 12-month sentence after four refusals. There is no alternative civilian service for Jehovah's Witnesses. = South Africa = Beginning on June 7, 1967, the apartheid South African government passed the Defense Amendment Bill, making it compulsory for all white males of eligible age to participate in the armed forces. The background to this bill was the rapid escalation of the South African Border War, with Communist-bloc countries increasingly sending men and material to southern Africa, and covert support from the USA and Israel to assist South Africa in stemming communism and black African nationalism. Internally, South Africa's domestic security situation was also changing drastically, as there was increasing resistance to the apartheid government in the form of protests, riots, bombings, and assaults on remote locations such as farms and military outposts. Conscription brought Jehovah's Witnesses into conflict with the government, and young men of eligible age who refused were punished by being sentenced to a military detention barracks. Sentences lasted for no less than 12 months, with repeat convictions in some cases. According to the Survey of Race Relations in South Africa of 1974, during 1973, 158 Jehovah's Witnesses (and one sun worshiper) were sentenced \\"for refusing on religious grounds to render service or undergo training.\\" In the first half of 1974, 120 Jehovah's Witnesses and two Christadelphians were sentenced. Conscription was officially ended in late August 1993. By this time, the Constitution of South Africa had been adjusted to allow for alternative civilian service instead of military service. =South Ossetia= In July 2017 the Supreme Court of South Ossetia ruled that Jehovah's Witnesses were an extreme organization. The court declared a penalty of ten years imprisonment for \\"any religious activities such as assembly and distributing literature.\\" = Soviet Union = Jehovah's Witnesses did not have a significant presence in the Soviet Union prior to 1939 when the Soviet Union forcibly incorporated eastern Poland, Moldavia, and Lithuania, each of which had a Jehovah's Witness movement. Although never large in number (estimated by the KGB to be 20,000 in 1968), the Jehovah's Witnesses became one of the most persecuted religious groups in the Soviet Union during the post-World War II era.Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin, The Sword and the Shield, New York: Basic Books, 1999, , p.503. Members were arrested or deported; some were put in Soviet concentration camps. Witnesses in Moldavian SSR were deported to Tomsk Oblast; members from other regions of the Soviet Union were deported to Irkutsk Oblast.Pavel Polian. \\"Against Their Will: The History and Geography of Forced Migrations in the USSR\\", Central European University Press, 2004. . p.169-171 KGB officials, who were tasked with dissolving the Jehovah's Witness movement, were disturbed to discover that the Witnesses continued to practice their faith even within the labor camps.Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin, The Sword and the Shield, New York: Basic Books, 1999, , p.505. The Minister of Internal Affairs, Viktor Semyonovich Abakumov proposed the deportation of the Jehovah's Witnesses to Stalin in October 1950. A resolution was voted by the Council of Minister and an order was issued by the Ministry for State Security in March 1951. The Moldavian SSR passed a decree \\"on the confiscation and selling of the property of individuals banished from the territory of the Moldavian SSR\\", which included the Jehovah's Witnesses. In April 1951, over 9,000 Jehovah's Witnesses were deported to Siberia under a plan called \\"Operation North\\".\\"Recalling Operation North\\", by Vitali Kamyshev, \\"–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∞—è –º—ã—Å–ª—å\\", –ü–∞—Ä–∏–∂, N 4363, 26 April 2001 –í–∞–ª–µ—Ä–∏–π –ü–∞—Å–∞—Ç .\\"–¢—Ä—É–¥–Ω—ã–µ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü—ã –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –ú–æ–ª–¥–æ–≤—ã (1940‚Äì1950)\\". –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞: –ò–∑–¥. Terra, 1994 The Soviet government was so disturbed by the Jehovah's Witnesses who continued to receive religious literature smuggled from Brooklyn that the KGB was authorized to send agents to infiltrate the Brooklyn headquarters.Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin, The Sword and the Shield, New York: Basic Books, 1999, , p.506. In September 1965, a decree of the Presidium of the USSR Council of Ministers canceled the \\"special settlement\\" restriction of Jehovah's Witnesses, though the decree, signed by Anastas Mikoyan, stated that there would be no compensation for confiscated property. However, Jehovah's Witnesses remained the subject of state persecution due to their ideology being classified as anti- Soviet.\\"Christian Believers Were Persecuted by All Tolatitarian Regimes\\" Prava Lyudini (\\"Rights of a Person\\"), the newspaper of a Ukrainian human rights organization, Kharkiv, December 2001 = Turkmenistan = The United Nations Human Rights Committee has indicated that Jehovah's Witnesses in Turkmenistan have been prosecuted and imprisoned for refusing to perform compulsory military service, despite Turkmenistan's constitution guaranteeing the right to \\"practice any religion alone or in association with others\\" and the right to \\"freedom of conviction and the free expression of those convictions\\". The UN committee noted, \\"The State party should take all necessary measures to review its legislation with a view to providing for alternative military service. The State party should also ensure that the law clearly stipulates that individuals have the right to conscientious objection to military service. Furthermore, the State party should halt all prosecutions of individuals who refuse to perform military service on grounds of conscience and release those individuals who are currently serving prison sentences.\\" According to the US Department of State, Turkmenistan's Ministry of Justice described Jehovah's Witnesses as foreign and dangerous. The US State Department also stated that the Turkmenistan government imposes restrictions on the freedom of Jehovah's Witness parents (and members of various other religious groups) to raise their children in accordance with their religious beliefs. In 2003, Witnesses' religious literature was confiscated, members of Jehovah's Witnesses were denied exit visas, and others were stopped after crossing a border and forced to return. In 2004, five Jehovah's Witnesses were stopped and prevented from boarding a flight to another country because their names were included on a \\"black list\\" of citizens prohibited from leaving the country. In 2015, a Jehovah's Witness in Turkmenistan was sentenced to four years in prison for allegedly inciting hatred at a religious meeting held in a private home, and other attendees were fined. As of January 2019, members were imprisoned. = United States = During the 1930s and 1940s, some US states passed laws that made it illegal for Jehovah's Witnesses to distribute their literature, and children of Jehovah's Witnesses in some states were banned from attending state schools. The persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses for their refusal to salute the flag became known as the \\"Flag-Salute Cases\\". Their refusal to salute the flag became considered as a test of the liberties for which the flag stands, namely the freedom to worship according to the dictates of one's own conscience. The Supreme Court found that the United States, by making the flag salute compulsory in Minersville School District v. Gobitis (1940), was impinging upon the individual's right to worship as one chooses ‚Äî a violation of the First Amendment Free Exercise Clause in the constitution. Justice Frankfurter, speaking on behalf of the 8-to-1 majority view against the Witnesses, stated that the interests of \\"inculcating patriotism was of sufficient importance to justify a relatively minor infringement on religious belief.\\" The result of the ruling was a wave of persecution. Lillian Gobitas, the mother of the schoolchildren involved in the decision said, \\"It was like open season on Jehovah's Witnesses.\\"Irons, Peter. A People's History of the Supreme Courtp. 341. New York: Viking Penguin, 1999. The American Civil Liberties Union reported that by the end of 1940, \\"more than 1,500 Witnesses in the United States had been victimized in 335 separate attacks\\". Such attacks included beatings, being tarred and feathered, hanged, shot, maimed, and even castrated, as well as other acts of violence. As reports of these attacks against Jehovah's Witnesses continued, \\"several justices changed their minds, and in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette (1943), the Court declared that the state could not impinge on the First Amendment by compelling the observance of rituals.\\" In 1943, after a drawn-out litigation process by Watch Tower Society lawyers in state courts and lower federal courts, the Supreme Court ruled that public school officials could not force Jehovah's Witnesses and other students to salute the flag and recite the Pledge of Allegiance. In 1946 and 1953 Supreme Court decisions were handed down establishing their right to be exempted from military service.

The cinematography is by Nicholas Musuraca. The movie was shot in California as well as some of the more scenic shots at Red Rock Crossing, Sedona, Arizona. The picture is based on the novel Gunman's Chance by Luke Short.. Plot Cowboy drifter Jim Garry is summoned by his friend, smooth-talking Tate Riling. Garry rides into an Indian reservation and finds himself in the middle of a conflict between a cattle owner and some homesteaders. He meets cattle owner John Lufton, and eventually his daughters Amy and Carol. The Luftons suspect that Garry is on Riling's side and are initially hostile, especially Amy. Garry readily admits that he is going to work for his friend. Riling tells Garry that he and Indian agent Jake Pindalest have devised an elaborate scheme to force Lufton into selling his herd cheaply. Pindalest has gotten the government to order Lufton to remove his cattle from the reservation in a week. Meanwhile, Riling has organized the homesteaders into blocking the move, conning them into believing that he is working in their best interests. With no other option, Lufton would have to sell his herd at bargain prices or lose everything. Lufton would never sell to Riling, but he would to a stranger like Garry. Pindalest would then see that the government buys the herd at an inflated price. Garry would get $10,000 for his part in the swindle. Lufton manages to outsmart Riling and move his herd unimpeded, but Riling and his men cause the cattle to stampede and scatter back onto the reservation. It would take several days to gather the herd, more time than Lufton has before the deadline. Garry becomes disgusted when a young man is killed in the stampede, and he switches sides. Amy still does not trust him. She suspects Garry of betraying the contents of a letter to Riling, unaware that Carol is enamored with Riling and is the one passing information to him. Eventually, Amy comes to trust (and fall in love with) Garry, especially after he defends her father from two of Riling's men. To buy time, Garry persuades Pindalest, who is unaware of his break with Riling, to send a messenger to the government to extend the deadline. Garry then takes Pindalest prisoner. Riling and his gang track them down. Garry flees to the cabin of Kris Barden, the father of the young man killed in the stampede; they are joined by Amy. A gunfight erupts. Though wounded earlier, Garry sneaks out at night, dispatches Riling's men and knocks out Pindalest. Then he and his old friend face each other. Riling is fatally wounded. Pindalest is taken into custody, and Garry decides to give up his wandering ways, much to Amy's delight.

Realizing \\"the costs of this burgeoning population were going to far exceed its capacity to provide adequate food, education, housing and employment\\", Iran's government \\"declared that Islam favored families with only two children\\", as one historian put it.Abrahamian, History of Modern Iran, (2008), p.184 Iran's Health Ministry launched a nationwide campaign and introduced contraceptives‚Äîpills, condoms, IUDs, implants, tubal ligations, and vasectomies.Sciolino, Elaine, Persian Mirrors: The Elusive Face of Iran, Free Press, 2000, 2005 (p.282) In 1993, Parliament passed further legislation withdrawing food coupons, paid maternity leave, and social welfare subsidies after the third child for government and para- government employees. The backlash to this law was severe and application of it remains limited. Birth control classes were required before a couple could get married. Dozens of mobile teams were sent to remote parts of the country to offer free vasectomies and tubal ligations. By 2001, an Iranian condom factory produced more than 70 million condoms a year, \\"packaged in French or English to suggest that they are imported\\", according to a foreign reporter. By this time Iran's population growth rate had dropped from an all-time high of 3.2% in 1986 to just 1.2%, one of the fastest drops ever recorded. In reducing its population growth to this level‚Äîa rate that is only slightly higher than that of the United States‚ÄîIran emerged as a model for other countries that want to lessen the risk of overpopulation. In 2007 Iran's Total Fertility Rate had dropped to 1.71 with a net out-migration of 4.29 ‚Ä∞ (and population 65 M).

Rutland House was the name of at least two London houses occupied by the Earls and Dukes of Rutland. That on Aldersgate Street was leased by playwright Sir William Davenant, who converted a room of it into a private theatre in the 1650s. That in Knightsbridge was a six-acre site until its demolition in the 1830s. Rutland House, Aldersgate Street Rutland House on Aldersgate Street, near Charterhouse Square in the City of London, close to Smithfield Market, was leased by the playwright and impresario Sir William Davenant (1606‚Äì1668). In 1656, freshly released from imprisonment, Davenant turned a room of the house into what was, at first, a private theatre performing his own plays. Soon the performances were advertised and semi-open to the public at a cost of 5 shillings a head, a figure that ensured that only persons of quality would be able to attend. The reason for Rutland House being used rather than a conventional theatre was to overcome the laws of censorship which operated in all public places following the closures of all public theatres by the Puritan government of Oliver Cromwell. The house seems to have been not totally suitable for theatrical use; however, a low narrow hall, or salon, at the rear of the house was adapted for the performances. Rather than sitting in comfort, the audience had to sit on improvised benches, and so confined was the space available that the benches had to be arranged at an angle to the small stage to accommodate the large audiences who came. The small stage, described by Davenant as a \\"Cup-board stage\\", was adorned with gold and purple curtains. Above the stage in what was contemporarily described as a \\"louver hole\\" was concealed a small orchestra. Davenant had seen Italian opera sung in Paris; this inspired him to conceive a cunning plan: as the Puritan government had no objection to music, only drama, he obtained permission to stage a performance of his opera The Siege of Rhodes, to be sung in \\"recitative music\\". Thus, the first English opera was performed at Rutland House in May 1656 , simultaneously overcoming the prohibition of drama. The Rutland House production also included England's first professional actress, Mrs. Coleman and was later transferred to the Cockpit Theatre in Drury Lane. Davenant established at least two other \\"private performance houses\\" in Lincoln's Inn Fields and Drury Lane. After Davenant opened more conventional theatres, he continued to use Rutland House to preview new productions, to gauge audience reaction. Rutland House, Knightsbridge Rutland House, Knightsbridge This was built for John Manners, 3rd Duke of Rutland. It enjoyed at first a rectangular plot of in Knightsbridge London, however by its destruction had sold off the north-east quarter for two large houses, one of which, Kent House, likely already served as a subsidiary. The house stood from the mid 18th century until it was demolished in 1836. =Rutland Gate= Rutland Gate, a double-square of grand houses around two tree-planted narrow communal greens was engineered and erected on its site, save for ‚Ññs 48C to 65 which come from the land to the west.

Piney Orchard began as a Planned Unit Development, and was a project of the Constellation Real Estate Group, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Constellation Energy Group, which itself, is now owned by Exelon. Construction of the community began in 1991, although groundbreaking for what was to become the Nature Preserve started in 1987, when Constellation Real Estate Group began the effort to restore wetlands in an area which had been mined for sand and gravel in the 1940s and 1950s. Several mitigation projects, the term used for this restoration, followed in five phases to replace wetlands filled in by the development of the community, and included the building and enhancement of five large ponds and the planting of shrubs, trees, and grasses native to the area. The Army Corps of Engineers, which oversees such efforts, monitored the progress of the mitigation sites until 1995, when it was determined the efforts had been successful. In 1996, the Piney Orchard Nature Preserve was officially opened. More than 3500 housing units have been built in Piney Orchard and approximately 8500 residents live there. Constellation turned over the day-to-day supervision of Piney Orchard to the homeowners of the community in 2005.

He is regarded as one of the greatest players ever to hail from the Netherlands. He was also a Frisian legend, most notably with the club where he made his name as a football player, Heerenveen. Career Lenstra played for a host of clubs such as SC Enschede, Enschedese Boys, PH: DOS '19, WSV, DOS Kampen and vv LTC. However, it was with VV Heerenveen (the previous name of current day sc Heerenveen) where he first was selected for the Dutch national team. When in 1954 professional football was introduced in the Netherlands the already 33-year-old Abe Lenstra moved from VV Heerenveen to the bigger SC Enschede. It was in Enschede where he missed his best chance of ever winning the Dutch title: in 1958 SC Enschede lost the first and last Eredivisie final ever after 180 minutes from DOS Utrecht. In 1960, he made the move to the rivals Enschedese Boys, where he ended his professional career in 1963. With the national team, for which he played a total of 47 caps scoring 33 goals, he struck a partnership with other internationals such as Faas Wilkes and Kees Rijvers. He was known to stand by his principles and objected to play for the national squad if he was not selected for the position he favoured. It was Lenstra who put the name of sc Heerenveen on the footballing map, where the club was also fondly referred to as 'Abeveen'. In 1977, long after he retired from football, he was diagnosed with having a brain haemorrhage and spent the remainder of his life using a wheelchair. He died in 1985, just a few days before the first ever international match in the stadium that a year later would bear his name. Legacy Today, his name has been closely associated with sc Heerenveen and its stadium: The (first and second) Abe Lenstra Stadion has been named in his honour as a lasting memorial to this Dutch football hero.

The Order was instituted in 1851 by Sultan Abdulmejid I.The Americana, Vol.15, Ed. Frederick Converse Beach, George Edwin Rines, (1912); History Instituted in 1851, the Order was awarded in five classes, with the First Class being the highest. The Order was issued in considerable numbers by Sultan Abd√ºlmecid as a reward for distinguished service to members of the British Army and the Royal Navy and the French Army who came to the aid of the Ottoman Empire during the Crimean War against Russia and to British recipients for later service in Egypt and/or the Sudan. In Britain it was worn after any British gallantry and campaign medals awarded, but, as an Order, before foreign medals like the Turkish Crimean War medal. The Order was usually conferred on officers but a few enlisted soldiers and sailors also received it in a lower class. During World War I it was also awarded to a number of German, Austrian and Bulgarian officers. The Order was often conferred on non-Turkish nationals. Design of the Order On the obverse of the star is Sultan Abd√ºlmecid's royal cipher surrounded by an inscription on a gold-bordered circle of red enamel; all on a star of seven triple quills with small crescents and five-pointed stars between them, suspended from a red enameled crescent and star suspender with green enameled edges. First Class Order Rough translation of the front: To the left: (you have) crossed. To the right: (you are proven to be) correct. At the top: (you have provided) protection. At the bottom: Year 1268.

Dudley through his company, Lanius Corporation. The software was first written and released for both MS-DOS and OS/2, with later versions supporting 32-bit Windows operating systems. The MS-DOS version interfaced with the serial port (and thus the modem) through a FOSSIL driver. Version 1.0 was released in 1990, with versions 2.0 and 3.01 following in 1991 and 1995. The source code for Maximus and its companion utilities, such as Squish, was released under the GNU General Public License in 2002. It has since been ported to run under Linux, and other Unix-like operating systems. By default, Maximus provides a relatively basic interface for BBS callers rendered in either ANSI or ASCII, compared with other BBS software. Menu layout is auto-generated and simply- drawn. With some effort, however, it is very customisable, including a provision for a system operator to supply RIP graphics for users. When BBS systems were popular, Maximus often appealed to system operators who wanted a system that appeared light-weight, but also to those who wanted great flexibility in their ability to customise their system's looks and behaviour. Maximus configuration is entirely through editing text files, prior to running a compiler to convert the text files to binary configuration files. Since the release of version 3.0 of Maximus, in December 1995, Maximus has supported two independent programming languages for system operators to customise their BBS. Both are compiled to Maximus-recognised byte-code before being used: * The MECCA language is primarily display-oriented, providing basic tokens to indicate actions such as colour changes for text displayed to a user, and simple functionality for designing things such as menus that require user input, or writing certain information to files on disk to exchange information with BBS door programs. * The MEX language is a more structured, Turing- complete programming language, that borrows ideas from C, Pascal, BASIC, and a selection of similar languages.

College career Weathersby played in college for Oregon State University. At OSU he started 45 games, and set a school record of 57 passes deflected. He was named to the Pac-10 All-Academic team 4 consecutive years. Professional career Weathersby was projected to be drafted in the first or second round of the 2003 NFL Draft. However, on April 20, 2003, only three days before the NFL draft, he was shot in the back in an apparent gang- related shooting when he and his friend were mistaken for gang members by the Du Roc Crips.https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/24/sports/sports-of-the-times- life-s-turns-can-dash-an-elite-athlete-s-hopes-in-an-instant.html Despite the incident, the Bengals still drafted him in the fourth round joining his former Oregon State teammates Chad Johnson and T. J. Houshmandzadeh who were also drafted. He survived and recovered from the shooting, but his injuries took longer than expected to heal and he only played in 4 games his rookie season. On April 12, 2004, he was involved in a car accident that put him into a coma. Dennis eventually came out of the coma and made such progress as to astound his doctors. The first sign that he might recover was when he was still supposedly unconscious and was visited by Bengals coach Marvin Lewis. Dennis' foot was hanging from his hospital bed when Lewis told him to put it back in the bed, Weathersby promptly put it back in his bed. Unfortunately for Weathersby, the Bengals, believing that he would never play football again, cut him before the 2005 season. It was reported by ESPN that doctors cleared him to resume work on May 17, 2006, and Weathersby announced plans to attempt a comeback to the NFL.KFFL - Dennis Weathersby, CB However, in March 2008, he stated that he did not want to put himself at risk for a hit that could reverse the damage, as well as a desire to 'follow God's will' and stepped away from professional football. Dennis states he is currently preparing for his CBEST test (to become a teacher) and has just passed the first set of tests in the application process for the City of Los Angeles Fire Department.

Born Junko Suzuki in Minato, Tokyo, into a tradition-steeped family of kimono merchants, she studied design and took an increasing interest in old Japan. She attended Nihon University, but gave up her formal studies to pursue research under the direction of author Shisei Inagaki. Inagaki specialized in the Edo period and taught Sugiura how to do the background surveys that would later ensure the historical accuracy of her manga and other works. Sugiura was the assistant of Murasaki Yamada, a prominent feminist manga artist. Sugiura published her first manga, \\"Tsugen Muro no Ume,\\" in the alternative manga magazine Garo in 1980. Her distinctive style drew heavily on ukiyo-e techniques and breathed life into her depictions of Edo-period life and customs, helping her win popularity as well as the Japan Cartoonists Association Award for her manga Gass≈ç (\\"Joint Burial\\") in 1984 and the Bungei Shunj≈´ Manga Award for F≈´ry≈´ Edo Suzume in 1988. In 1993, Sugiura announced that she was retiring from her life as a manga artist to dedicate herself to research on Edo period lifestyles and customs. She wrote numerous books on the subject, which she considered to be her life's work, and frequently appeared in the media as an expert on the period. She was well known and liked for her commentary during the ending segment of a popular NHK program, Comedy: O-Edo de Gozaru, which was set in the Edo period. Sugiura was usually seen in public wearing traditional kimono. Sugiura was married for a time to novelist, translator, and bibliophile Hiroshi Aramata, a pairing the Japanese media referred to as \\"the beauty and the beast.\\" She was also famous for her love of soba buckwheat noodles as well as a preference for sak√©.

The company owned numerous brands, particularly for flour, where its core business started, and for consumer food products. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was once a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index but was acquired by Premier Foods in March 2007. History=Early years= The Company was founded by Joseph Rank in 1875 as flour milling business when he rented a small windmill.Burnett, R.G., Page 24 He initially lost money and therefore took a co-tenancy at West's Holderness Corn Mill. In 1885 he built a mechanically-driven flour mill in Hull in order to beat competition from abroad.Burnett, R.G., Page 41 He used steel rollers instead of mill stones thereby producing six sacks of flour an hour instead of one and a half. In 1888 he built another steel-roller plant in Lincolnshire, and soon after, built a more modern plant, producing 20 sacks of flour an hour.Burnett, R.G., Page 56 As he strove for greater productivity he installed equipment that produced 30 sacks of flour an hour, and then 40 sacks an hour.Burnett, R.G., Page 119 He also set up agencies to distribute his flour in parts of England where it previously had not been sold. In May 1899 the business was incorporated as a private company under the name Joseph Rank Limited.Burnett, R.G., Page 105 In 1902 Joseph Rank made his first trip to the United States to understand and beat his American competitors.Burnett, R.G., Page 114 Soon after his trip abroad, the company built mills in London and Cardiff. In 1912, a mill in Birkenhead was built to supply the needs of Ireland and northwestern England. Rank then moved the corporate headquarters of the Company from Yorkshire to London.Burnett, R.G., Page 115 During World War II the company employed 3,000 workers, many of them women working while their husbands were away at war. In 1935 Joseph Rank was awarded the Freedom of the City of Hull, in part because of a trust fund he had set up in Hull to help \\"poor persons of good character.\\"Burnett, R.G., Page 202 During the 1920s, Rank expanded into Scotland and Ireland. He also formed the British Isles Transport Company Limited to facilitate transport of his products around the country. The Company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1933.Burnett, R.G., Page 213 In 1943 James Rank became Chairman following his father's death. In 1945 James Rank, the new chairman, assisted by Cecil Loombe, who had become a director, set about rebuilding mills destroyed by bombing, which included the new Baltic Flour Mill at Gateshead, opened in 1950. In 1952, James Rank was succeeded by his brother J. Arthur Rank as Chairman. Arthur explored ways of improving quality control in food production founding RHM Technology and its research centre at High Wycombe.Better test for GM foods BBC News, 6 April 1999 =Formation of RHM= In 1962 the Company acquired the Hovis-McDougall Company, founded in 1957 after the merger of Hovis Bread Flour Company, founded in 1898, and McDougall Brothers, founded in 1864 by Alexander, Isaac, Arthur, John and James Thomas, with its famous Hovis brand of bread and became Ranks Hovis McDougall Limited.Hovis: History In 1968 RHM went on to buy the Cerebos food group, which brought with it a number of popular food brands as well as interests in France, Argentina, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, the United States and South Africa. In 1969 Arthur's nephew, Joseph Rank, took over the Chairmanship of the Company. Joseph Rank encouraged research work in crustacea farming, cereal and seed production, and wheat hybrids. He also pioneered protein production from starch. In 1984 the Company established a joint venture with ICI known as Marlow Foods. It was Marlow Foods that created the meat substitute product Quorn.How Quorn was born in Marlow Bucks Free Press, 18 October 2007 In 1981 Sir Peter Reynolds took over as Chairman from Joseph Rank. The company made a number of important acquisitions during the 1980s in the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Far East including the purchase in 1987 of Avana Group, which was renamed Avana Bakeries Limited.Just desserts for RHM Management today, 1 December 1992 In 1992 the Company was purchased by Tomkins plc who then sold it on to Doughty Hanson & Co in 2000.Tomkins loses buns-to-guns tag with sale of RHM to Doughty Hanson Independent, 22 July 2000 The Company remained in private equity ownership and sold a number of non-core business, including bakery retail chain Three Cooks.

Operations Prior to takeover, the group was grouped into three divisions; Bread Bakeries, Culinary Brands and Cakes & Customer Partnerships. Premier Foods is in the process of integrating Culinary Brands, Cakes and Customer Partnerships into its core business unit, although Bread Bakeries (including Rank Hovis milling) are to remain as a stand-alone business unit for the time being, because of the different supply chain demands such as high volume and the short shelf life of bread. =List of brands= * Atora shredded suet * Bisto gravy * Be-Ro flour * Cadbury's cakes (manufactured under licence from Cadbury plc) * Cerebos salt * Frank Cooper's jams * Hovis bread and flour * McDougalls flour and cake mixes * Mother's Pride bread * Mr Kipling cakes * Paxo stuffing * Robertson's jams * Rombouts coffee * Saxa salt * Sharwood's Indian, Chinese and SE Asian sauces The Rank name A common misconception is that the \\"Rank\\" in the name signifies an acquired business of the Rank Organisation. This is understandable as Rank themselves were at one point a highly diversified conglomerate, and were apt to rename acquired or joint venture business by prefixing them with the name \\"Rank\\", e.g. Rank Xerox. There is a link, but the \\"Rank\\" reference is to Joseph Rank, father of J. Arthur Rank, who merely inherited the business upon his father's death. It always remained a separately run enterprise.

The bridge carries RI 24 and RI 138 between the communities of Portsmouth and Tiverton, Rhode Island. The current bridge is a box girder bridge that opened in 2012 at a cost of $120 million (USD). The previous bridge was a truss bridge that was built in 1956 and demolished in 2012 due to structural deficiencies. The truss bridge had previously served as a replacement for the Stone Bridge, about 0.8 mi (1.3 km) to the south. It became part of RI 24 during the 1960s after the completion of the Portsmouth and Tiverton Expressways. At one point, it was briefly considered for inclusion as part of the never-built Interstate 895. Tolls In August 2013 after the opening of the new bridge, the Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority began collecting a 10-cent toll from drivers with an E-ZPass transponder using an open road tolling gantry. Those without E-ZPass were expected to call the Authority's office to arrange payment. The toll was imposed in order to keep open the future possibility of higher tolls due to a quirk in federal law. The toll was removed in June 2014 and the Rhode Island Department of Transportation stated in 2019 that they would not impose any tolls on the bridge in the future.

His fresco paintings are notable for the use of foreshortening. He was the most important member of the Forl√¨ painting school.  Biography  Melozzo was supposedly from a wealthy family named Ambrosi from Forl√¨. Nothing is known about his early years. It is only a hypothesisThe theory is credited to Luigi Lanzi. See that he was formed by the Forlivese school of art, then dominated by Ansuino da Forl√¨; both were influenced by Andrea Mantegna. It has been said, also without confirmation, that he became a journeyman and color-grinder to master painters. His presence was first mentioned in his birthplace in 1460 and again in 1464. Around this period, and together with Antoniazzo Romano, he painted frescoes in the Bessarione chapel in the Basilica dei Santi Apostoli in Rome. Melozzo then moved to Urbino, probably between 1465 and 1474. There he met Piero della Francesca, who profoundly influenced Melozzo's style and use of perspective. He would have also studied architecture by Bramante and the work of Flemish painters then working for duke Federico da Montefeltro. Melozzo may have worked with Justus of Ghent and Pedro Berruguete to decorate the studiolo of the city's famous Ducal Palace. Around 1472-74, Melozzo transferred to Rome, although some authorities claim his presence in Rome five or ten years earlier for work in the Basilica di San Marco. In 1477 he finished his first major work in the new seat, a fresco now transferred to canvas and placed in the Pinacoteca Vaticana, representing Sixtus IV Appointing Platina as Librarian of the Vatican Library. In the same year Girolamo Riario built his palace in Rome, now known as Palazzo Altemps, with designs by Melozzo. In 1478 he was one of the original members of the Academy of St Luke, founded by Sixtus IV to unite the chief painters working in the city. In about 1472-74, Melozzo was commissioned by Pietro Riario to paint the vault of the apse in the basilica dei Santi Apostoli in Rome, his subject being the Ascension of Christ. In this work, Christ is boldly and effectively foreshortened. This fresco was taken down in 1711. The figure of Christ is now in the Quirinal Palace; some of the other portions, which influenced Raphael, are in the sacristy of St Peter's. A hall in the Vatican Museums, with designs of angels and apostles by Melozzo, was taken from the same fresco. Another work of the Roman period is an Annunciation that can still be seen in the Pantheon. Melozzo's last work in Rome was a chapel, now destroyed, in the church of Santa Maria in Trastevere. After the death of Sixtus IV in 1484, Melozzo moved from Rome to Loreto. There he painted the fresco in the cupola of the sacristy of San Marco in the Basilica della Santa Casa, commissioned by cardinal Girolamo Basso della Rovere. It is one of the first examples of a cupola decorated both with architecture and figures; it greatly influenced the Camera degli Sposi by Mantegna. In 1489 Melozzo returned to Rome. During this period he probably drew some cartoons for the mosaics of Jesus blessing in the Chapel of St Helena of the basilica of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme. Melozzo also painted the cupola of the Capuchin church at Forl√¨, which was destroyed in 1651. It has been said that he executed at Urbino some of the portraits of great men (Plato, Dante, Sixtus IV, et al) which are now divided between the Barberini Palace and the Campana collection in Paris. In 1493 he worked on some ceilings, now lost, of the Palazzo Comunale of Ancona. Eventually Melozzo returned to Forl√¨, where, together with his pupil Marco Palmezzano, he decorated the Feo Chapel in the church of San Biagio, which was destroyed during World War II. The Pinacoteca of Forl√¨ houses a fresco by Melozzo, known as the \\"Pestapepe,\\" or Pepper-grinder, now much damaged. Originally painted as a grocer's sign, it is an energetic example of rather coarse realism and is Melozzo's only secular subject. Melozzo died in November 1494 in Forl√¨ and is buried in the Church of the Santissima Trinita (Most Holy Trinity). Selection of musician angels from fresco paintings of the Basilica dei Santi Apostoli, by Melozzo da Forli (Pinacoteca of the Vatican Museums)  Legacy  While few of Melozzo's works are still preserved, critics agree that he contributed to the progress of pictorial art. Without being remarkable as a colorist, he painted with care and finish, creating fine and dignified figures. His use of perspective influenced other painters. Melozzo's works bear a certain resemblance to those of his contemporary Andrea Mantegna. Marco Palmezzano was a pupil of Melozzo. The signature \\"Marcus de Melotius\\" on some of Palmezzano's works, along with a general affinity of style, has led to their being ascribed to Melozzo and to the latter being incorrectly named \\"Marco Melozzo\\". The paintings of Melozzo strongly influenced Michelangelo, Raphael and Donato Bramante.

Kuching. is an ethnic group found in Sarawak, Malaysia and in Kalimantan, Indonesia. The Punan Bah people are distinct and unrelated to the semi-nomadic Penan people. Their name stems from two rivers along the banks of which they have been living since time immemorial. They do have other names: Mikuang Bungulan or Mikuang and Aveang Buan. But those terms are only used ritually these days. The Punan (or Punan Ba) have never been nomadic. In the old days, they based their living on a mixed economy ‚Äì Swidden agriculture with hill paddy as the main crop, supplemented by a range of tropical plants which include maniok, taro, sugar cane, tobacco, etc. Hunting, especially wild boar, fishing, and gathering of forest resources, are the other important factors in their economy. However, in the late 1980s, many Punan, notably the younger, more educated, gradually migrated to urban areas such as Bintulu, Sibu, Kuching and Kuala Lumpur in search of better living. However, they didn't abandon their longhouses altogether. Many would still return home, especially during major festivities such as Harvest Festival or Bungan festival as it is known among Punan. Punan is a stratified society of 'laja' (aristocrats), 'panyen' (commoners), and 'lipen' (slaves). This determines their historical traditions that have been preserved. Just like most of the history of European Middle Ages is linked to and mainly concerned the various ruling monarchs, so are the historical and mythical traditions of Punan closely connected to their rulings aristocrats.  Relation to sub-ethnic Punans  Kelirieng or burial pole at Pandan, Bintulu. This kelirieng was erected for a Punan aristocrats at Pandan or Pedan as it is known to the Punan. Kelirieng is a uniquely Punan ancient burial custom which the other ethnics namely the Kejaman, Lahanan, Kayan later adopted (copied). There is this common misunderstanding that all the so-called Punan on the island of Borneo are related and referring to the same tribe. In Sarawak, for example, there is the confusion between Punan and Penan. On the other hand, throughout the island of Borneo, the term Punan often indiscriminately used referring to the then (unknown or yet to be classified) tribes as such as Punan Busang, Penihing, Sajau Hovongan, Uheng Kareho, Merah, Aput, Tubu, Bukat, Ukit, Habongkot, Penyawung as Punan. This heritage from colonial times still remain until today. As a result, there are now more than 20 different tribes or ethnics with the name Punan that may be related or unrelated to one another in the island of Borneo. These tribes include: * Punan Aoheng or Pnihing of East Kalimantan, Indonesia * Punan Aput of East Kalimantan, Indonesia * Punan Basap of East Kalimantan, Indonesia * Punan Batu of East Kalimantan, Indonesia * Punan Batu 1 of Sarawak, Malaysia * Dayak Bukat of Sarawak of Malaysia, East Kalimantan and West Kalimantan of Indonesia * Punan Busang * Punan Habongkot * Punan Hovongan of Kapuas Hulu Regency, West Kalimantan, Indonesia ** Punan Bungan of West Kalimantan, Indonesia * Punan Kelay / Kelai of East Kalimantan, Indonesia * Punan Lisum * Punan Merah (Siau) of East Kalimantan, Indonesia * Punan Merap of East Kalimantan, Indonesia * Punan Murung of Murung Raya, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia * Punan Nibong of Brunei and Sarawak, Malaysia * Punan Panyawung * Punan Sajau of East Kalimantan, Indonesia * Punan Tubu of East Kalimantan, Indonesia * Punan Uheng Kereho / Keriau of Kapuas Hulu Regency, West Kalimantan, Indonesia * Punan Ukit / Bukitan / Beketan of Sarawak, Malaysia and East Kalimantan, Indonesia  Ethnic classification  Officially, as under the Sarawak Interpretation Ordinance,Article 161A, Clause 6 of the Malaysia Constitution of Malaysia Federal Constitution Punan is group under Kajang together with Sekapan, Kejaman, Lahanan and Sihan. Unofficially, they are also included in the politically coined term Orang Ulu ‚Äì popularised by a political association known as Orang Ulu National Association or (OUNA). The association is a Kayan and Kenyah dominated association which they established in 1969.  Punan longhouses  Punan are mostly found around Bintulu, Sarawak. Punan peoples can only be found at Pandan, Jelalong and Kakus in Bintulu Division; along the Rajang River, their longhouses dotted areas spanning from Merit District to lower Belaga town. The Punan are believed to be one of the earliest peoples to have settled in the central part of Borneo, the Rajang River and Balui areas together with the Sekapan, Kejaman and Lahanan. However, the mass migrations of Kayans, subsequently followed by the warfaring Ibans into Rejang and Balui areas approximately some 200 years ago, forced the Punan communities living in these areas retreating to Kakus and subsequently to Kemena basin. As of 2006, there were more than 10 Punan settlements (longhouses) found along the Rejang, Kakus, Kemena and Jelalong river. These settlements (longhouses) are: * Punan Lovuk Sama, * Punan Lovuk Ba,Punan Ba longhouse razed in fire * Punan Lovuk Biau, * Punan Lovuk Meluyou, * Punan Lovuk Lirung Belang (name by Rumah Bilong before and now as known as Rumah Ado) * Punan Lovuk Mina, * Punan Lovuk Pandan (also Rumah Nyipa Tingang), and * Punan Lo'o Buong (Jelalong also known as Rumah Adi. The total Punan population is estimated to be around 3000‚Äì5000 people.  Language  Bungan Gathering of Bungan followers at Punan Sama. Belaga Punan tribe. Punan speak the Bah-Biau Punan language, one of the Punan languages. Although often confused with Penan, Punan is closer to the language spoken by the Sekapans and Kejamans. Here some word spoken in Punan: > 1\\\\. Nu denge? - How are you? > 2\\\\. Nu ngaro no? - What is your name? > 3\\\\. Piro umun no? - How old are you? > 4\\\\. Tupu koman si - Do you have your lunch/diner/breakfast? >  Religion and beliefs  Punan traditional religion was a form of animist known as \\"Besavik\\". The Brooke era saw the arrival of Christian missionaries, bringing education and modern medicine into Sarawak. But the Punan communities remain with their traditional religion of Besavik and subsequently adopting a cult religion - Bungan brought by Jok Apui, a Kenyah from Kalimantan. However, the late 1990s showed an increase in the number of Punan converting to Christianity. This is partly due to more and more Punan becoming educated and modernised. As of 2006, almost half of Punan are now Christian, leaving only the elderly, less educated still remain observing \\"Bungan\\" religion. The Punan have a unique burial custom. In the early days they did not bury their aristocrats or lajar. Instead they built a pole known as kelirieng of 50-meter height to lay down their beloved leaders. In Sarawak it is estimated that there are fewer than 30 kelirieng left standing. The Punan still practise a secondary burial ceremony, whereby the dead body is kept at their longhouses for at least 3‚Äì7 days. This is partly to give more time for far-away relatives to pay their last respects to the deceased.  Current associations  There are two Punan association that are in existence today:- * Persatuan Kebangsaan Punan (Punan National Association), Malaysia. * Yayasan Adat Punan (Punan Culture Foundation), Indonesia.  References  Notes  Note: There is still lack of literatures on Punan peoples. Available information about these peoples were often sourced from either passing notes written by Brooke and Colonial administrators not in-depth scholarly research. The earliest? literature on Punan is probably one written by Eduardo Beccari, an Italian botanist and traveller in 1876?. In the late 1950s, Rodney Needham, Tom Harrisson, de Martinoir wrote a brief notes on Punan people they either personally met or heard from their guides along the Rajang river. Because of the lack of information many have confused them for Penan and also the Punan of Kalimantan. In Sarawak for example the Punan was wrongly classified as Penan by the National Registration Department in the late 1990. They are also often confused for a politically coined term such as \\"Kajang\\" and \\"Orang Ulu\\". As such the Punan through their association Punan National Association is willing to collaborate with both foreign and local scholars who interested in doing social, economic research among the communities.

These include measures approved in a 1971 city-council ordinance, a 1974 voter referendum making possession of small amounts of the substance merely a civil infraction subject to a small fine, and a 2004 referendum on the use of medical marijuana. The passage of the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act in November 2018 has made recreational marijuana legal not only in Ann Arbor but throughout the entire state. Marijuana ordinance of 1971 Through the 1960s and early 1970s, as Ann Arbor played host to a number of radical organizations‚Äîincluding formative meetings of Students for a Democratic Society, the establishment of the White Panther Party, and the local Human Rights Party‚Äîpublic opinion in the city moved steadily to the left on the criminalization of marijuana possession. The Michigan Daily, the main student newspaper at the University of Michigan, gained national press coverage by urging the legalization of marijuana as early as 1967. However, two more specific factors pushed the city towards the eventual adoption of marijuana enforcement provisions that proved to be among the most liberal in the country. The first factor was local reaction to the state penalties, which provided for a year's imprisonment for possession of two ounces (57 g) or less, four years' imprisonment for the sale of marijuana, and harsher penalties for repeat offenses. These penalties received national attention when poet and activist John Sinclair was sentenced to ten years in prison for possession of two joints, a sentence that sparked the landmark John Sinclair Freedom Rally at Ann Arbor's Crisler Arena in December 1971. The event brought together a who's-who of left-wing luminaries, including pop musicians John Lennon, Stevie Wonder, and Bob Seger, jazz artists Archie Shepp and Roswell Rudd, and speakers Allen Ginsberg, Rennie Davis, Jerry Rubin, and Bobby Seale. Three days after the rally, Sinclair was released from prison after the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that the state's marijuana statutes were unconstitutional. The second factor was the April 1971 election to Ann Arbor city council of two candidates from the Human Rights Party (HRP), an organization that promoted local progressive and radical causes. In September 1971, several months after they took their seats on council, the HRP's two council members spearheaded a bill that would reduce city penalties for possession of less than two ounces of marijuana to a $5 civil-infraction ticket. (The city penalty had previously been identical to the state penalty.) City police would then charge violators under the city ordinance rather than the state statute. The HRP representatives, by garnering the support of Democratic council members, quickly managed to pass the ordinance over the objections of council Republicans. In supporting the new ordinance, Democratic mayor Robert J. Harris told The Washington Post, \\"In this town, it was the only way to go. ... We've made a great effort to get a decent relationship between the kids and the cops. Now at least we'll get the police out of the marijuana business.\\" Outside observers characterized the ordinance as the most lenient in the country. In press interviews, the city attorney described the penalty as \\"sort of like a parking ticket\\", explaining that violators could mail the ticket, with a guilty plea and the fine, back to city hall in order to dispose of the charge. City police and prosecutors agreed to use the $5 city ordinance, rather than the still-applicable state laws, as the tool for enforcement against violators. The city police chief, however, promised to continue to pursue large-scale drug dealers aggressively, using the harsher state laws against this class of violator. Shortly after the measure's adoption, The New York Times reported: \\"Under the trees on the University of Michigan campus, in the back rows of movie theaters‚Äîeven, it is said, in the public gallery of the City Council chamber itself‚Äîyoung people are increasingly lighting up marijuana in public these days.\\" However, both police and independent academic observers asserted in national media articles that the amount of marijuana smoked in the city had not increased; the locations had merely switched to include more public spaces. Charter amendment of 1974 Within weeks of its adoption, the new marijuana ordinance had sparked outrage in many parts of the state. The director of the Michigan State Police, for instance, immediately threatened to move his troopers into Ann Arbor in order to enforce the state codes against possession of marijuana. In the first test case, decided on September 29, 1972, a district court judge ruled the ordinance unconstitutional as an \\"intrusion of Ann Arbor in the judicial functions of the State of Michigan.\\" City voters responded in November by electing Perry Bullard to the Michigan House of Representatives on a platform that called for full legalization of the possession, but not sale, of marijuana by adults throughout the state. Despite the adverse court ruling, the city's marijuana ordinance remained in place until June 1973, when it was repealed by the city council. The local debate attracted attention from a number of national media outlets, including CBS and NBC television news programs and The New York Times. During the council's vote to repeal, about 150 spectators packed council chambers to light up joints in protest, and one protester hurled a cherry pie at Mayor James Stephenson. On April 2, 1974, voters in Ann Arbor overruled the council's decision by amending the city charter with the famous Section 16.2, which, in somewhat altered form, remains in effect today. The charter section reinstated the $5 civil-infraction penalty for possession, use, giving away, or selling of marijuana and prohibited city police from enforcing the more stringent state laws. The same day, the neighboring city of Ypsilanti adopted a similar measure. In adopting the charter amendment, Ann Arbor voters asserted that the provisions were necessary to ensure the \\"just and equitable legal treatment of the citizens of this community, and in particular of the youth of this community present as university students or otherwise.\\" Part of Section 16.2 declared that no city police officer \\"shall complain of the possession, control, use, giving away, or sale of marijuana or cannabis to any other authority except the Ann Arbor city attorney; and the city attorney shall not refer any said complaint to any other authority for prosecution.\\" In doing so, the provision effectively denied state courts the opportunity to declare the measure unconstitutional, as had occurred in 1972, since a test-case opportunity would thus never come before a state judge. The perception of the city as a haven for marijuana permeated the local culture. In January 1975, the countercultural Ann Arbor Sun newspaper held a \\"Win a Pound of Colombian\\" giveaway contest of marijuana. Meanwhile, John Sinclair ran a local, pro-legalization radio program entitled Toke Time on Ann Arbor's WNRZ. Tightening the marijuana law in 1990 During the 1980s, pressure grew from Ann Arbor Republicans to eliminate the city's lenient marijuana city-charter section. In a 1983 referendum, Ann Arbor voters rejected a proposed repeal of the section, with 61.7 percent of voters opposing the proposed tightening of marijuana codes. By the late 1980s, however, moderate GOP mayor Gerald D. Jernigan was calling the marijuana code an \\"embarrassment\\" to the city. In January 1990, the city council approved holding a referendum on increased penalties for possession, use, or sale of marijuana. In the resulting referendum, held in April 1990, 53 percent of voters agreed to amend Section 16.2 of the city charter with heightened penalties, raising the fine from $5 to $25 for a first offense, $50 for a second offense, and $100 or more for further offenses. The offense, however, remained a civil infraction rather than a misdemeanor or felony. In the same election, using a tactic modeled on the city's original $5 marijuana law, voters approved a charter amendment intended to protect access to abortion in Ann Arbor if it ever became illegal in the state of Michigan. Voters mandated that, should abortion ever become illegal, a city ordinance would come into force under which abortion would be punishable in Ann Arbor solely by a $5 fine. Local judges would thus have the ability to assess the $5 fine rather than any more punitive state penalties. Crafted as the state legislature debated increased restrictions on abortion in Michigan, including the adoption of a parental-consent bill, the measure declared the city a \\"zone of reproductive freedom.\\" See also The legality of the charter amendment remains unclear, since it has never been tested. One local activist expressed disappointment with the voters' marijuana decision, telling USA Today: \\"The people were clearly pro-choice on abortion, and I expected them to be pro- choice on marijuana as well.\\"Activist Rich Birkett quoted in However, even with the new fine, possession of small amounts of the substance remained largely decriminalized in Ann Arbor, since the penalty continued to consist only of a civil-infraction ticket similar to a traffic fine. Indeed, the Ann Arbor Observer reported in 2012 that assistant city attorney Bob West could remember \\"only two times in the last five years that possession of non-medical marijuana has resulted even in a formal court hearing‚Äîand then only because the users contested tickets received under the city‚Äôs lenient marijuana law.\\" Medical-marijuana referendum of 2004 On November 2, 2004, voters in Ann Arbor approved the Ann Arbor Medical Marijuana Initiative authored by city resident Rich Birkett. This ballot initiative amended Section 16.2 of the city charter to allow the growing and use of marijuana for medical purposes. The measure also capped fines for the third and subsequent offenses for non- medical uses or sale at $100. The measure passed with 74 percent approval among voters. The Ann Arbor initiative was only one of several similar measures on local and state ballots that day: Columbia, Missouri, another college town, approved a similar law on medical marijuana, as did the state of Montana, while Oregon voters rejected an initiative to loosen its existing medical-marijuana program, and Alaska voters rejected total decriminalization of marijuana possession. However, what had been a relatively uncontroversial measure during the election proved controversial following its passage. Shortly after its approval, the Ann Arbor city attorney Steve Postema characterized the initiative as \\"unenforceable,\\" citing its conflicts with federal and state law. Likewise, city police chief Dan Oates announced that his police force would disregard it and continue normal enforcement practices. Activists who had worked to put the initiative on the ballot quickly expressed their outrage. But since medical-marijuana users in Ann Arbor are very rarely prosecuted, and because the penalty for first-time possession remains a $25 civil-infraction fine, both the 2004 ballot measure itself and Oates's subsequent statements on enforcement may prove to be more symbolic than substantive. Michigan Medical Marijuana Act of 2008 In November 2008, Michigan voters passed the Michigan Medical Marijuana Act. The new state law supports the Ann Arbor City charter by offering protection from state law enforcement for qualifying patients and their assigned primary caregivers under the law that took effect on April 4, 2009. Under the law, a patient with a qualifying condition and a signed statement from an attending physician, can register for an identification card under the Michigan Department of Community Health managed program for legal medical marijuana use in Michigan. After registration, the patient and primary caregiver can legally be in possession of marijuana according to State law. The primary caregiver may provide assistance for using medical marijuana or even be assigned responsibility for cultivating the patient's legally protected maximum of 12 marijuana plants, for a fee. Even though the legal use of medical marijuana was allowed for in the Ann Arbor City Charter, it was still illegal in the State of Michigan, allowing for arrest by state police and other state law enforcement agencies. With this new protection under the Michigan state law, the only remaining threat to a registered patient or caregiver in Ann Arbor is from the untested nature of the new state law and the acts of the D.E.A and other federal law enforcement agencies.

In 1998 the company changed its name to Arcadia Group. Philip Green purchased the company in 2002. The Burton company archives are held at the West Yorkshire Archive Service in Leeds.West Yorkshire Archive Service, Leeds Architecture Abergavenny Beginning in 1923, Burton began to acquire freehold sites in order to build its own custom designed stores. Prominent town centre corner sites were preferred and the shops often moved a few doors along the same street in order to acquire the corner site. Leeds-based architect Harry Wilson was hired at this time and developed the Burton \\"house style\\" building design. In 1931 Burton took over Wilson's practice to make it the in-house architecture department. Wilson was replaced as chief architect by Nathaniel Martin in 1937. This Burton in-house architecture was Art Deco in style. Individual stores vary from the more restrained red-brick with neoclassical scroll headed columns to fully fledged Art Deco with glazed white faience tile, geometric patterns and stylised elephant heads. However, there are also many standard elements such as a wide polished black granite band above the shop windows for signage, metal vent grates bearing the company logo, billiard halls on the upper levels, window lights showing the locations of other Burton stores, and mosaic titles ‚Äì sometimes including the company logo ‚Äì in the doorways. At ground level, foundation stones were often placed by Montague Burton's four children, Barbara, Stanley, Arnold and Raymond. Each store might have one or several foundation stones, each bearing one name and the year. For example: \\"THIS STONE LAID BY RAYMOND MONTAGUE BURTON 1937\\". The children were quite young when these stones were laid. Stanley Howard was born in 1914 and laid a stone for the Nottingham Beastmarket Hill store in 1924. At least six stores bear stones laid by Montague's wife \\"Lady Burton\\", and a number in the mid to late 1930s were laid by Austin Stephen Burton who may have been a grandchild. Whilst some of these Burton buildings have been destroyed over the years, many are still standing and some of them still have active snooker clubs upstairs. Some are still occupied by Burton stores (often a combined Burton and Dorothy Perkins store) but many have changed use. McDonald's first three restaurants in the UK were opened in former Burton stores in 1974 and 1975 as the company was selling property at that time. Most of the Scottish stores are listed with Historic Environment Scotland, protecting them from changes. However, only six stores in England and Wales are listed buildings, leaving over 200 with no protection from future changes or demolition. Recent years have seen stores demolished in Plymouth (2004) and Neasden (2012).

The \\"Burton\\" moustache was styled upon two influential moustache types; the English and the Handlebar.

Catalina State Park is accessed from the town of Oro Valley on Arizona State Route 77, north of Tucson. Cultural history There is evidence that the park and surrounding area have been continuously occupied since about 5000 BCE by the Hohokam people. The Romero Ruin still contains pueblos built of rock and adobe, as well as a Mesoamerican ballcourt. The earliest date the pueblo would have been lived in is between 550‚Äì600 CE. The site was widely used for nearly 400 years; 1000‚Äì1450 CE. The namesake of this ruin, Francisco Romero, built a ranch on the site in the 19th century, and most likely used stone from the previous Hohokam structure to build his house, and fortifications to protect him from the Apache.

It is a moated cylindrical brick structure with an inner courtyard 24.4 meters in diameter, and seven turrets. Its 3-meter-thick walls hold 130 embrasures. The barbican was originally linked to the city walls by a covered passageway that led through St. Florian's Gate and served as a checkpoint for all who entered the city.This article incorporates information available at the Polish Wikipedia, including English text at Verbia ‚Äì Guided tours of Krakow The Poles built the barbican fearing an attack by the Ottoman Empire after the defeat of King John I Albert at the Battle of the Cosmin Forest.

The building was threatened with demolition early in the 19th Century. However, in 1817 two senators of the Free City of Krak√≥w, Feliks Radwanski and Jan Librowski, convinced the Senate to preserve the Barbican and other parts of the old fortifications. Design The Barbican was originally a large, circular tower with an interior open space with a diameter of . It was built of brick and stone and stood four stories tall. It had seven watch towers. The walls were about at their base and at the top. The Barbican's exterior gate, the Kleparz Gate, was protected by a large, semi-circular moat 26 wide and deep.  Features  Considered a masterpiece of medieval military engineering, the circular fortress of the Krak√≥w's Barbakan was added to the city's fortifications along the coronation route in the late 15th century, based on Arabic rather than European defensive strategy.

Uniden became a well-known brand in the 1970s by manufacturing and marketing millions of CB radios, under the Uniden brand as well as many for popular private brand labels such as Realistic, Clegg (amateur transceivers), Cobra, Craig, Fanon-Courier, Midland (only certain clone models, originals were made by Cybernet), President, Teaberry, Stalker, Super Star, Teledyne-Olson, Pearce Simpson, Regency, Robyn and many European brands such as Zodiac, Stabo and Inno-Hit. Uniden also marketed CB Radios in the UK under the Uniden and Uniace brands during the late 1970s. During the 1980s, Uniden grew to become the world's largest manufacturer of cordless telephones in addition to television satellite equipment, mobile radios, advanced marine electronics and radio scanners (the latter under brandname Bearcat). In Europe, it became successful in the telecommunications market with its introduction of 900 MHz cordless telephones. As Uniden continued to grow and extend its international operations, Uniden Australia and Uniden New Zealand were established in 1989. Uniden's revenue has plummeted since smartphones and VOIP solutions have become mainstream. In 2007, Uniden had a revenue of 77.7 billion yen. Just three years later in 2010, Uniden reported a revenue of just 35.5 billion yen. Operation Uniden's runs numerous lines of business in research and development, manufacturing and marketing.

The name is a corruption of \\"silly islands\\", a nickname given to the road system when it was built in the 1930s. History and notability Since the 19th century there has been a large pub at the junction, named for a prominent aristocrat-soldier the Marquis of Granby. The junction acquired its name during the 1930s when the then new Kingston by-pass road rejoined the original route of the Portsmouth Road that was then the equivalent to today's A3. The present road is termed the A307 and the A309 crosses this and links via a dualled section to the A3 road and the north. A series of roundabouts were built at the busy (for the 1930s) intersection, then called \\"traffic islands\\". The unfamiliar nature of the double roundabout caused it to be called the \\"silly islands\\", which became locally accepted as its name, but this soon evolved into the \\"Scilly Isles\\", copying the name of the islands to the west of Cornwall. This name, although intended to be disapproving, thus became an official name, visible on all approaches to the junction and the highest definition maps. The complexity of the junction combined with traffic greater than the planners envisaged has periodically created tension between those who wish to replace it with a more conventional layout and those who consider it to be a landmark or to reduce speeding in an ingenious way. There are relatively frequent accidents at the junction due to a small minority of users not reading the road markings or signs along its course - the northern approach is Hampton Court Way that leads to Hampton Court Palace, which adds to such users. The Esher side, being the closer town, has far more priority than the Kingston side (the small roundabout must give way to the bigger, and the latter is to the west). The nearby Sandown Park Racecourse hosts the annual Scilly Isles Novices' Chase. Littleworth Common and Ditton Marsh to either side are almost undeveloped commons, mostly covered by trees and grass/scrub respectively.

He took part in the second and third Anglo-Dutch wars, both of which he is, by some, credited with having started. He was made governor of the Isle of Wight, where he is buried in Yarmouth parish church. Holmes is chiefly remembered for his exploits on the cruise to Guinea (1664) for the Royal African Company, and for the so-called Holmes's Bonfire of 1666. He is regarded as an archetypal figure both of the quarrelsome restoration officer and of the coming into being of the British professional naval officer. The Interregnum=Military beginnings= Born in or about 1622 the son of Henry Holmes, esq. of Mallow, County Cork, Ireland, nothing is known of Holmes' early life, although his flawless command of written language and his elegant handwriting suggest a good education. He is in all probability the grandchild of the Robert Holmes named provost of Mallow in 1612. He first appears in 1643 on the Cavalier side of the Civil War, in Prince Maurice's regiment of horse as a cornet in the troop of Captain Richard Atkyns. From this time stems a lifelong friendship with Maurice's brother, Prince Rupert, whom he accompanied onto the battlefields of the continent once the Royalists had been defeated. =Start of the naval career= When in 1648 a part of the fleet went over to the exiled king, Holmes (now an army captain), following Maurice and Rupert, came into his first contact with the navy. He participated in the epic cruise of the Royalist fleet of 1649 ‚Äì 1652 to Kinsale, the Mediterranean, West Africa (where, between the Gambia and Cape Verde, he was temporarily captured by the natives), and the West Indies. The drain of manpower, through storm, action, and mutiny, was so large that at the end of the cruise, Holmes had advanced to commanding the four prizes the force brought back to France. With Rupert returning to the exiled court, it fell to Holmes to see the fleet paid off. Subsequently, Cromwell's intelligence service reports Holmes having obtained a privateer commission from the King of Spain (Thurloe State Papers VII, p. 248, 18 July 1658. N.S.), although the total absence of other evidence makes his actually setting out as a privateer improbable. He may, like other Royalist, and notably Irish, officers, have taken up service with the Imperial army. His epitaph in Yarmouth gives France, Flanders and Germany as scenes of military exploits. Immediately before the Restoration, Holmes acted as a courier between Charles II and Edward Montagu, by whose commission he obtained his first command in the navy, the Medway guardship Bramble. Restoration Officer Upon Charles II's return to England, Holmes was rewarded for his services with the captaincy of Sandown Castle, Isle of Wight together with a new commission (for another guardship), this time from the Duke of York himself, who had assumed the position of Lord High Admiral. But more was in store for him. =The first African expedition= The reports Rupert had brought back from the Gambia of a \\"Mountain of Gold\\" just waiting there to be carried off to England, prompted the Royal African Company, whose director was the Duke of York (and whose paperwork was carried out by William Coventry) to launch an expedition to the Guinea Coast, then mostly in Dutch hands. Holmes, acquainted with this coast, was the man for this venture, and was appointed captain of the flagship, Henrietta and a squadron of four other of the King's ships: Sophia, Amity, Griffin, and Kinsale. His orders (drafted by Coventry) were to assist the company's factors in every way conceivable and to construct a fort. Privately, he was instructed to gather intelligence as to the expected \\"Mountain of Gold\\". The results of the expedition were ambiguous. Touching at Gor√©e, Holmes bluntly informed the Dutch governor that the King of England claimed the exclusive right of trade and navigation between Cape Verde and the Cape of Good Hope (which the King and Sir George Downing disavowed after protests from the States General and retaliatory action against English shipping). In addition to reconnoitring the coast and the mouth of the Gambia, Holmes constructed a fort there (on Dog Island in the mouth of the river, renamed Charles Island). Up-river, on St. Andreas Island near Jillifri, he then captured a fort which was nominally the Duke of Courland's, but obviously in Dutch hands, and renamed the spit of land James Island. Although the mission did not pay for the company, Holmes seems to have made a profit from it, since subsequently Samuel Pepys, of all people, complained about Holmes's magnificent lifestyle (Diary, 22 December 1661), and wondered whether the large ape Holmes had brought back might be the offspring of a man and a she- baboon and susceptible to instruction (Diary, 24 August 1661). The expedition was the turning point in Holmes's career. He had shown himself equal to dealing with Africans, company factors, the Dutch and his own men and officers alike, recommending himself as a prudent leader. He consequently was appointed captain of the flagship, Royal Charles, which he lost quickly after having failed to force the Swedish ambassador to salute the flag. But this was only a temporary setback, and he swiftly was granted ¬£ 800 from the Crown and the command of the newly launched Reserve. The appointment of an inept master led to a quarrel with Pepys, which subsided after a while, but the antagonism between the administrator and the aggressive fighter was never resolved. Aboard Reserve, Holmes tested a pair of pendulum watches conceived by Christiaan Huygens. =The second African expedition= The objectives of the famous 1664 Guinea expedition are unclear. Although Holmes was charged with exceeding his orders by capturing Dutch forts and ships there, Coventry talks of a \\"game\\" that was to be started there, which can only mean an Anglo-Dutch war (Bath MSS. CII, ff. 3-13). Holmes's orders, again drafted by Coventry and signed by James, were to 'promote the Interests of the Royall Company' in HMS Jersey and to 'kill, take, sink or destroy such as shall oppose you' (Bath MSS. XCV, ff.3-5) - especially the Goulden Lyon of Flushing, a Dutch West India Company ship that had given the English a lot of trouble. The reason for the charges against Holmes was that his success exceeded even the most unreasonable expectations, and that he was, diplomatically, a convenient scapegoat (a fact of which he seems to have been aware). In sight of the Dutch base at Gor√©e he took the West Indiaman Brill on 27 December 1663. Stirring up the Portuguese, Africans, and even such Dutch merchants as had a grudge against the WIC, he sank 2 ships and captured 2 others under the guns of Gor√©e (22 January 1664), and the next day took possession of the fort itself. On 28 March, in a tactically cunning action, he took Goulden Lyon meanwhile named Walcheren (taken into the Royal Navy as a fourth-rate). On 10 April he captured Anta Castle on the Gold Coast and several other small strongholds and ships. But the greatest coup was the capture of the principal Dutch base in West Africa, Cape Coast Castle near El Mina, on 1 May. Contrary to the popular picture, Holmes had no hand in the capture of New Amsterdam. In August, Michiel de Ruyter had clandestinely been sent to undo what Holmes had achieved. De Ruyter recaptured everything Holmes had conquered, except for Cape Coast Castle, which meant that after 1664, the English were on that coast to stay. His return to England was desultory, as he tried to make out the repercussions his actions had evoked in London. Since he commanded navy ships, everything he had taken was not automatically the company's property, but would have to be cleared by Admiralty Courts to be prizes of Holmes and his men. Since Holmes's booty in merchandise was far behind the company's (unreasonable) expectations, he was twice committed to the Tower (9 January and 14 February 1665), where he was interrogated by secretaries of state Henry Bennet and William Morrice. This situation was resolved by the Dutch declaration of 22 February that they would retaliate against British shipping, a direct consequence of the goings-on in Africa, that the British conveniently interpreted as a declaration of war. =The Second Dutch War= Barely a month after his release and full pardon, Holmes assumed command of , a third-rate of 58 guns, the senior captain of Rupert's white (van) squadron. When at the battle of Lowestoft (3 June 1665) the rear-admiral of the white, Robert Sansum, was killed, Holmes claimed his post (which Rupert endorsed), but James gave the flag to his own flag captain, Harman. Holmes lost his temper and resigned his commission. Even worse, Holmes's rival Sir Jeremiah Smith was promoted to flag rank. But reconciliation was, again, not far away. On 27 March 1666, the powerful new third-rate Defiance (64) was launched in the presence of Charles II, James and Rupert, Holmes having been appointed captain and being knighted on the occasion. Part of the red squadron, Holmes was finally given acting flag-rank when the fleet was divided to shadow the Dutch and simultaneously intercept the French (which put him, satisfyingly, one step above Harman, rear-admiral of the white - a slighting of the principle of seniority which would have been unthinkable at the end of the century). During the murderous Four Days Battle, Holmes was reported to have \\"done wonders\\" (CSP Dom., 7 June 1666), and was confirmed as rear-admiral of the red, his ship having received such a battering that he transferred his flag to the partially burnt and dismasted Henry (72), Harman's ship, who had been wounded. But again, his rivals Sir Jeremiah Smith (made admiral of the blue) and Sir Edward Spragge (vice-admiral of the blue) were promoted above him. These professional rivalries were a hallmark of the restoration navy, and Holmes used the conduct of the St James' Day Fight, to start a bitter quarrel with Sir Jeremiah Smith, whose rear squadron had been routed by Cornelis Tromp. The recriminations between the officers and their respective factions played a role in the subsequent Parliamentary investigation over embezzlement in the naval administration and the conduct of the war. Holmes's BonfireOn 9 August 1666, Holmes achieved his best-known feat, characteristically (and, to Pepys and Coventry, exasperatingly) using his own judgement in interpreting his orders. Holmes was to land five hundred men on the island of Vlieland and four hundred on Terschelling and loot and destroy as much as possible. Instead of this, Holmes executed a fireship attack on the mass of merchantmen lying in Vlie Road, destroying some 150 ships, and sacked the Mennonite town of West- Terschelling.The Dutch Raid on the Medway, Samuel Pepys, 1667 This, Holmes's Bonfire, was the heaviest blow the English ever dealt Dutch merchant shipping, severely endangering the Netherlands' war effort, at the cost of no more than twelve English casualties. Holmes now was in high favour. Early in 1667 he was appointed to command a squadron based in Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight, a lucrative appointment that even enabled him to fit one of the squadron's prizes as a privateer. As early as December 1666, Pepys had commented on Holmes's stubborn opposition to the laying-up of the fleet in expectation of peace. Holmes was alive to the danger of a Dutch assault - which duly came on 10 June 1667, when Michiel de Ruyter during the Raid on the Medway entered the Medway, burned a large part of the fleet in ordinary (i.e. laid up) at Chatham and hijacked Royal Charles. After that year's campaign had ended, Parliament's interest in naval administration intensified, much to Pepys's and Coventry's distress. Rupert and Albemarle, like most naval officers, especially of the Cavalier and gentleman sort, had long been unhappy with the off-hand treatment they received from the administrators. These, in turn, found the officers arrogant and unruly. Now the commanders-in-chief and their clients, Sir Frescheville Holles, Holmes and others, might strike back, especially after the Medway disaster. In addition, Holmes in the winter of 1666/1667 had revived the quarrel with Sir Jeremiah Smith (possibly even fighting a duel with him), which was only ended when the latter took Sir William Penn's place on the Navy Board (which again Holmes had hoped would be his) in December 1668. After peace was concluded, Holmes intensified his hold in the Isle of Wight by buying the governorship from Lord Colepeper. This put him in responsibility of the defences there (Sandown, Carisbrooke and Yarmouth Castles), but also gave him access to the very lucrative vice-admiralty of the Isle of Wight, Newport and Hampshire, with two-thirds of the value of all prizes taken there due to him. In addition, in October 1669, he was elected Member of Parliament for Winchester, generally supporting the Crown in Parliament. =The Third Dutch War= Holme's attack on the Smyrna Fleet, 12 March 1672 Among the preparations for provoking the Dutch into yet another war, was the appointment of Holmes as senior officer in Portsmouth, commanding a powerful squadron and the flagship St Michael, a first-rate of 90 guns. Holmes immediately pressed for the capture of a large number of Dutch ships, using English harbours under foreign colours; but the government procrastinated until the opportunity was gone. On 23 March 1672, he finally got permission to attack the homeward-bound Dutch Smyrna convoy. For two days, the English squadron fought a veritable battle with the armed merchantmen and their escorts, suffering damage out of proportion to their gains, half a dozen prizes only one of which seems to have been one of the rich Smyrna ships. Accidentally, Sir Edward Spragge's squadron, returning from the Mediterranean, had passed the scene immediately before the engagement. For unknown reasons, Spragge did not join the attack nor was invited by Holmes to do so, which gave rise to new mutual suspicions. A few days after the fight war was declared and flags handed out. Holmes did not receive one, which may have had to do with the limited number of posts available due to the white squadron this time consisting of the French fleet. Accordingly, Holmes fought in the ensuing Battle of Solebay as a mere captain in the Duke of York's squadron. The battle, the fiercest in De Ruyter's memory, claimed the lives of Holmes's friends Holles and Sandwich, and forced the Lord High Admiral to transfer his flag twice, from Prince to Holmes's St Michael and from that to London. With Sandwich dead, a new flag officer had to be appointed, but Holmes's legitimate claims were again disregarded - for the last time. After the end of the 1672 campaign, Holmes did not get another command, notwithstanding the constant intercession on his behalf of the new commander-in-chief, his stout friend Prince Rupert. Obviously, the King himself had no desire to re-employ him. Holmes's naval career had very abruptly ended. Life in \\"retirement\\" Holmes's house in YarmouthAlthough he would not let him serve in his fleet any longer, the King continued to lavish gifts upon Holmes, rents in Co. Southampton, the Isle of Wight and Wales and forfeited lands in Galway and Mayo. He possessed houses in London, Englefield Green near Windsor, Bath, and of course an establishment worthy of a governor in Yarmouth. Most of his time in \\"retirement\\", Holmes spent in rebuilding the Isle of Wight's castles and managing parliamentary elections to ensure the return of government candidates. He himself did not run for the Exclusion Bill Parliaments of 1679‚Äì1681, and in 1682 he incurred the severest displeasure of Charles II for presenting an address from the Duke of Monmouth. A court martial was prepared together with a warrant to transfer the governorship to the Duke of Grafton, but Holmes either managed to avert prosecution or acquitted himself, for he remained governor until his death. A stout supporter of his lifelong employers, the royal brothers, it is unclear why Holmes should have associated with Monmouth; at the centre of the question may lie the shady Irish financier Lemuel Kingdon, who sat for Newtown and Yarmouth together with Holmes's brother, John. Statue of Holmes in Yarmouth Parish Church. On 21 August 1687, secretary of state Sunderland signed a commission that put Holmes in command of a squadron to suppress the buccaneers of the West Indies, but it is doubtful whether he ever actually took command. Since the wound received during the clash with the Smyrna Convoy, his health was steadily deteriorating, and an expedition that sailed in September 1687 was commanded by Sir John Narborough in his stead. Holmes was now busy preparing the defence against Dutch invasion. On 4 November 1688, five sailors of the invasion fleet landed on the Isle of Wight to buy provisions, being welcomed by the population. While the English fleet lay becalmed off Beachy Head and William III landed his forces at Torbay, Holmes wrestled with his mutinous militia. While James had fled his capital on 11 December (an action Parliament took as his relinquishing the throne) and one day later, the commander-in-chief, Sir George Legge, Lord Dartmouth brought the fleet over to William, it was not before 17 December that Holmes surrendered. He continued as governor of the Isle of Wight, although he was occasionally suspected of Jacobite conspiracy. But such reservations as he had against the overthrow of James II stemmed from the loyalty of a military professional, and after his vote in parliament against the accession of William and Mary was defeated, he served them with the same determination as he had the Stuart kings. Although his health was now rapidly giving out and he had to spend more and more time of the year in Bath, the threat of French invasions in 1690 and 1692 made him hurry back to his post as swiftly as ever. Holmes died on 18 November 1692, leaving one illegitimate daughter and heiress, Mary's (born 1678) mother is believed to have been Grace Hooke , a niece of the famous scientist Robert Hooke. As had been her father's wish, she married Henry Holmes, the son of his elder brother Colonel Thomas Holmes of Kilmallock, Co. Limerick. Her son Thomas, in turn, would eventually achieve the peerage for the family as Lord Holmes of Kilmallock in 1760. Holmes's younger brother, Sir John Holmes, was a naval captain of repute and competence, having for years served together with his eminent brother, and commanded the Channel Fleet (1677‚Äì1679).

The area was originally created in an ill-fated effort to preserve and protect the sensitive Desert Bighorn Sheep population on Pusch Ridge, one of the last remaining populations in Arizona. Due in part to increased residential and commercial development around the Santa Catalina Mountains in Oro Valley and the Catalina Foothills, however, the Desert Bighorn Sheep population in the wilderness area has dwindled dramatically, and sightings have nearly ceased in recent years. In November 2013, 31 adult bighorn sheep were reintroduced to the area. In early February 2014, 2 lambs were spotted by an Arizona Game and Fish Department official. These two are the first Catalina-born desert bighorn sheep in nearly 25 years. Plant life at lower elevations includes saguaro cactus and other desert plants. Trees found at mid-level elevations include mountain mahogany, juniper and pinyon pine. Forests of fir and aspen grow above 8,000 feet. In the middle of the Santa Catalina mountains there is a dome-shaped core of Catalina granite, formed in the Triassic period. The south face of the mountains is formed by Catalina gneiss with bands of white quartzite, this face is the form of a steep anticline and it is separated from the rest of the mountains by a series of valleys.

This model was first proposed in 1878 by Ewald Hering, a German physiologist, and later expanded by Richard Solomon, a 20th-century psychologist. American psychologist Benjamin Avendano contributed to this model, by adding a two- factor model.  Visual perception  The opponent-process theory was first developed by Ewald Hering. He noted that there are color combinations that we never see, such as reddish-green or bluish-yellow. Opponent-process theory suggests that color perception is controlled by the activity of three opponent systems. In the theory, he postulated about three independent receptor types which all have opposing pairs: white and black, blue and yellow, and red and green. These three pairs produce combinations of colors for us through the opponent process. Furthermore, according to this theory, for each of these three pairs, three types of chemicals in the retina occur, in which two types of chemical reactions exist. These reactions would yield one member of the pair in their building up phase, or anabolic process, whereas they would yield the other member while in a destructive phase, or a catabolic process. The colors in each pair oppose each other. Red-green receptors cannot send messages about both colors at the same time. This theory also explains negative afterimages; once a stimulus of a certain color is presented, the opponent color is perceived after the stimulus is removed because the anabolic and catabolic processes are reversed. For example, red creates a positive (or excitatory) response while green creates a negative (or inhibitory) response. These responses are controlled by opponent neurons, which are neurons that have an excitatory response to some wavelengths and an inhibitory response to wavelengths in the opponent part of the spectrum. According to this theory, color blindness is due to the lack of a particular chemical in the eye. The positive after-image occurs after we stare at a brightly illuminated image on a regularly lighted surface and the image varies with increases and decreases in the light intensity of the background. The veracity of this theory, however, has recently been challenged. The main evidence for this theory derived from recordings of retinal and thalamic (LGN) cells, which were excited by one color and suppressed by another. Based on these oppositions, the cells were called \\"Blue-yellow\\", \\"Green-red\\" and \\"black-white\\" opponent cells. In a recent review of the literature, Pridmore notes that the definition of the color 'green' has been very subjective and inconsistent and that most recordings of retinal and thalamic (LGN) neurons were of Red-cyan color, and some of Green-magenta color. As these colors are complementary and not opponent, he proposed naming these neurons as complementary cells.  Motivation and emotion  Opponent process theory of drug addiction Richard Solomon developed a motivational theory based on opponent processes. Basically he states that every process that has an affective balance (i.e. is pleasant or unpleasant) is followed by a secondary, \\"opponent process\\". This opponent process sets in after the primary process is quieted. With repeated exposure, the primary process becomes weaker while the opponent process is strengthened.Solomon, R.L. (1980). The Opponent-Process Theory of Acquired Motivation: The Costs of Pleasure and the Benefits of Pain. American Psychologist, 35, 8, pp. 691‚Äì712 The most important contribution is Solomon's findings on work motivation and addictive behavior. According to opponent- process theory, drug addiction is the result of an emotional pairing of pleasure and the emotional symptoms associated with withdrawal. At the beginning of drug or any substance use, there are high levels of pleasure and low levels of withdrawal. Over time, however, as the levels of pleasure from using the drug decrease, the levels of withdrawal symptoms increase. The theory was supported in a study Solomon conducted along with J.D. Corbit in 1974, in which the researchers analyzed the emotions of skydivers. It was found that beginners have greater levels of fear than more experienced skydivers, but less pleasure upon landing. However, as the skydivers kept on jumping, there was an increase in pleasure and a decrease in fear. A similar experiment was done with dogs. Dogs were put into a so-called Pavlov harness and were shocked with electricity for 10 seconds. This shock was the stimulus of the experiment. In the initial stage (consisting of the first few stimuli) the dogs experienced terror and panic. Then, when they stopped the stimuli, the dogs became stealthy and cautious. The experiment continued, and after many stimuli, the dogs went from unhappy to joyful and happy after the shocks stopped altogether.Solomon and Corbit. An Opponent-Process Theory of Motivation. \\"The American Economic Review\\", 1978, pg.12-24. article via Jstor In the opponent-process model, this is the result of a shift over time from fear to pleasure in the fear-pleasure emotion pair. Another example of opponent processes is the use of nicotine. In the terms of Hedonism, one process (the initial process) is a hedonic reaction that is prompted by the use of nicotine. The user gains positive feelings through the inhalation of nicotine. This is then counteracted, or opposed, by the second, drug-opposite effect (the opponent process). The drug-opposite effect holds hedonic properties that are negative, which would be the decrease in positive feelings gained by the inhalation of nicotine. The counteraction takes place after the initial hedonic response as a means to restore homeostasis. In short, the use of nicotine jumpstarts an initial, pleasurable response. It is then counteracted by the opponent process that brings one back to their original level of homeostasis. The negative feelings begin to take hold again, which in this case would be the craving of nicotine. Repeated use of the substance will continue to strengthen the opponent process, but the feelings gained through the initial process will remain constant. This dynamic explains tolerance, which is the increase in the amount of drug/substance that is needed to overcome the opponent process that is increasing in strength. This also explains withdrawal syndrome, which occurs by the negative, drug-opposite effects remaining after the initial, pleasurable process dies out. Hurvich & Jameson proposed a neurological model of a general theory of neurological opponent processing in 1974. This led to Ronald C. Blue & Wanda E. Blue's general model of Correlational Holographic Opponent Processing. This model proposes that habituation is a neurological holographic wavelet interference of opponent processes that explains learning, vision, hearing, taste, balance, smell, motivation, and emotions. Beyond addictive behavior, opponent-process theory can in principle explain why processes (i.e. situations or subjective states) that are aversive and unpleasant can still be rewarding. For instance, after being exposed to a stressful situation (cold pressor test), human participants showed greater physiological signs of well-being than those in the control condition.Deuter, C. E., Kuehl, L. K., Blumenthal, T. D., Schulz, A., Oitzl, M. S., & Schachinger, H. (2012). Effects of Cold Pressor Stress on the Human Startle Response. PLoS ONE, 7(11), e49866. Self-report measures and subjective ratings show that relief from physical pain can induce pleasant feelings,Leknes, S., Brooks, J. C. W., Wiech, K. and Tracey, I.

It was first published in the October 2003 issue of Analog. Plot summary The story begins following the first day of Dixie Mae Leigh's job as a customer support employee at a fictional company called Lotsatech. She receives an insulting and mysterious email and, in a fit of rage, decides to find out who sent it. She and a fellow employee Victor search the Lotsatech campus looking for the author of the email, following clues in the email header. They meet up with Ellen, a grad student in computer science, who decides to try to help Dixie Mae. While they talk, several mysteries arise and convince them that the email may be a kind of warning about something going on at Lotsatech involving a professor named Gerry Reich, who seems to be involved in all the projects on the campus. Ellen finds another clue in the email leading the three to another building where, to their utter astonishment, a second Ellen appears. The only explanation of this is that they are being simulated by a computer. Further clues from another person in the building lead them to an underground lab where they find two researchers working on improving methods of producing and preserving Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensates. When Dixie Mae and the Ellens reveal that they are all actually simulations, the researchers explore the email and find a clue that leads them to a 'cookie', a file that is passed from each iteration to the next with messages from the centuries of time they have been simulated over and over. They also find out that it was actually Dixie Mae herself who wrote the email in order to make it as offensive as possible to herself, allowing each iteration of the researchers to access the cookie. The story ends with a sad Dixie Mae realizing she can't do anything herself to stop the endless cycle they are all in, but through the passing of information and ideas from one iteration to the next someday they will have the ability to stop the simulations.

A notorious work of \\"heresiography\\", i.e. the description in detail of heresy, it appeared the year after Ephraim Pagitt's Heresiography. These two books attempted to catalogue the fissiparous Protestant congregations of the time, in England particularly, into recognised sects or beliefs. Pagitt worked with 40 to 50 categories, Edwards went further with around three times as many, compiling a list of the practices of the Independents and more extreme radicals: Nature of Gangraena Gangraena is generally described as an alarmist work, deducing a collapse of national polity from the ramification of different religious creeds. Typically, the Baptist Hanserd Knollys was accused of being an Anabaptist.Barry H. Howson, Erroneous and Schismatical Opinions: The Questions of Orthodoxy Regarding the Theology of Hanserd Knollys (c. 1599-1691) (2001), p. 1.

It appeared in three volumes, with information added from correspondents, and Richard Baxter in particular was also a contributor.William Lamont (1979), Richard Baxter and the Millennium p. 252. Scholarly opinions on it are now mixed, having in the past been somewhat dismissive of the work as paranoid and probably counter-productive in the way of providing and circulating a menu of \\"heretical\\" options.

The series aired on TV Tokyo from October 4, 2003 to September 25, 2004, with a total of 51 half-hour episodes. This series is the first of Toho's \\"Seishin (Star God)\\" series. The premise of this series is similar to both the Super Sentai series and the manga/anime series Saint Seiya: there are 12 heroes, divided into four tribes, and each tribe has a giant transforming robot. The events and characters are described below, using in-universe tone. Plot Some 400,000,000 years after an advanced human civilization was destroyed by aliens, 12 direct descendants of the civilization's warriors (called \\"Sazers\\") have their powers awakened and form four tribes: Flame, Wind, Earth and Water. Each Sazer is based on a Zodiac sign represented in an animal totem or spirit representation. At first, they wage war on each other, but after learning the truth of their ancestry and their reason for awakening, the Gransazer tribes unite to protect Earth from the Warp Monarch, an alliance of various alien species, from once again extinguishing all life on the planet.Gransazers Episode 27. =1st Arc: Karin Saeki and the three tribes (1-12)= The archaeologist Ichiro Horiguchi has indeed discovered a crystal tablet that revealed the existence of this ancient civilization and Gransazers. As luck would have it, his assistant Mika (Mithras) happened to be a Gransazer belonging to the Flames Tribe, and they soon met the second member of this Tribe, the impetuous Tenma (Tarious) and also the third one Ken (Lion), who was also Mika's younger brother. Together, they go in search of the other three Tribes and the corresponding Chouseishins. Unfortunately for them, a scientist named Karin Saeki has meanwhile gathered the members of the Wind Tribe and convinced them that the Flames represents a threat to the Earth. Then start a race against the clock between the two camps to gather the members of the Tribe of the Earth and locate the Chouseishins, even destroying them to prevent the other camp from seizing them. The Earth Tribe quickly ranks side by side with the Flames, while Wind's members begin to have doubts about Karin's sincerity except for their leader, Remls, who is in love with her. And the result prove them right: Karin is actually an extraterrestrial planet Akelon sent to Earth by a mysterious sponsor to destroy the Gransazers. Her true nature revealed, Karin is transformed into a giant monster that is destroyed by Chouseishins three tribes finally reconciled. =2nd Arc: The Impactors and the Water Tribe (13-24)= After Karin's defeat, the Impacters, a trio of extraterrestrial fighters uniting Logia, Lucia and Radia, are sent to Earth to destroy Leviathan, the Chouseishin of the Water Tribe, before the Gransazers find him. Unfortunately, all their attempts are turned against them. They first send an asteroid crashing on the island where it is hidden but Cloud Dragon (the ship carrying Chouseishins) destroys it and the debris free Leviathan from his hiding place. Radia then turns into a giant to destroy him but he is killed after the Water Tribe has appeared and taken control of Leviathan. For his part, Horiguchi discovered the existence of a fifth Chouseishin, Guntras, and tried to repair the apparatus to control it with the help of Professor Masaki Wakui and his assistant Sh√ªichi Hoshiyama. Unfortunately, once the device is repaired, it is stolen by Shuichi who was in fact Logia disguised, who uses it to take control of Guntras he intends to explode inside the sun to destroy our solar system. The Gransazers happily fail his project and the control system is destroyed, making Guntras autonomous. Subsequently, the Gransazers discover that the other Chouseishins can combine with Guntras to form a giant dragon named Daisazer. Thanks to him, they manage to triumph over Lucia turned into an uncontrollable giant, then Dailogian, a giant robot driven by Logia. Vanquished, the latter commits suicide (apparently) using a device of self-destruction. =3rd Arc: Various aliens (25-41)= Unlike the other parts which are characterized by a main plot spanning several episodes and by one or more main opponents, the third prefers to focus on independent stories in one or two episodes using the classic formula of \\"one episode = an opponent\\", with the exception of episodes 33, 34, 40 and 41, in which the Gransazers are once again confronted with a living Logia and drunk with revenge. The different episodes, however, have good suspense and carefully avoid the trap of repetitiveness. In addition, the fact that most of the episodes of this third part give the spotlight to only one Gransazer at a time makes it possible to flesh out characters that the series had difficulty to develop in the other episodes which privileged the team with the detriment of his members. This third part also introduces a last giant robot designed by the JSDF, Yuhi, and the Gran Vehicles, individual vessels that the Gransazers fly when they do not command their Chouseishins. Unfortunately, after the rise that marked the second part, it all seems a little light. =Final Arc: Bosquito and Wolf Manafu (42-51)= The fourth and final part begins when an alien named Luka frees Bosquito, a particularly powerful and dangerous creature with the same powers as the Gransazers. Bosquito is finally defeated after four episodes, many civilian casualties and the sacrifice of Luka, while one of the Gransazers, Ran (Visuel), discovers a great affinity with the crystal tablet that reveals to him that the first Gransazers had been created to fight the Bosquitos who are the real ones responsible for the destruction of the ancient earth civilization, while the famous extraterrestrial fleet had actually intervened at the request of the space union Wof Manaf to help Earth fight them after they took control of Chouseishins. Unfortunately, convinced that the current earthlings are descendants of Bosquitos, Wolf Manafu decides to launch a new attack on our planet, which is an opportunity to discover that their ships have hardly changed in 400 million years. As the fleet gets closer, the Japanese army and the Gransazers are contacted by Brighton, a \\"peaceful\\" envoy of Wolf Manafu, who tells them that Ran is actually a Bosquito. Horrified, she is ready to let Wolf Manafu execute it, unaware that it is a trick to eliminate it because she is the only one able to use the crystal tablet to communicate with the leader of Wolf Manafu. For the home run, writers set the bar in terms of threats, starting with Bosquito, a formidable predator whose new abilities are constantly being discovered and which will cause the death of many civilians (whereas in previous episodes the collateral victims of the battles of our heroes were generally ignored), before continuing with the threat of a fleet ready to exterminate the human race. It is also in this last part that the writers finally solve the questions asked at the beginning of the series by revealing the reasons for the battle that had opposed the Earth to Wof Manaf while going against the expectations of the viewer, since unlike To the appearance, the squadron of Wolf Manafu did not fight Earthlings but Bosquitos. The GranSazers Descendants of the warriors from the ancient human civilization, they later learn that the GranSazers were created to protect Earth from the Bosquito. Each GranSazer is marked by a glowing symbol, corresponding to their astrological sign, on the back of their left hand. This symbol can turn into a Knuckle-Riser. By setting the Knuckle-Riser to \\"Transformation Mode\\", they can equip high-powered suits that transform them into GranSazers. Their transformation call is GranSazer is composed by 12 members split amongst four elements. When three members of the same element have been awakened and gathered, a Tribe is formed. When three members gather and set their Knuckle-Risers to ChouSeiShin Mode, they can summon a machine of incredible power called an . Once a Tribe's respective ChouSeiShin has been summoned, one member can set their Knuckle-Riser to \\"Boarding Mode\\" in order to \\"Dive-In\\" and board their ChouSeiShin. The one who is on their ChouSeiShin can change into a giant folding robot. The other two GranSazers would later pilot jetfighters called Gran Vehicles. Each GranSazer also has their own unique weapon, which can be summoned by setting their Knuckle-Riser to \\"Arms Mode\\". When piloting their respective ChouSeiShin, they can equip the ChouSeiShin with a large version of their personal weapon by setting their Knuckle-Riser to \\"Sazer-Gear Mode\\". They can also communicate with other Sazers by setting the Knuckle-Riser to \\"Communication Mode\\". The GranSazers can also perform a combination attack called \\"Formation Zero\\". The attack involves Sazer-Tarious, Sazer-Mithras, Sazer-Lion, Sazer-Dail, Sazer-Tragos and Sazer-Pisces all performing a sandwich jump kick on the enemy. =Flame Tribe= The are the first tribe to recognize the alien threat and the second to be fully assembled. From the very beginning, they were assisted by Professor Horiguchi, who helped them realize their duty as Gransazers. The Flame Tribe armoured suits are all bird-shaped with red-based colour and they pilot the Flame-Driver Grand Vehicles. This tribe is also the one and only tribe which two of their members (Tarious and Lion) can equip Garuda with a large version of their personal weapon by setting their Knuckle-Riser to \\"Sazer Gear Mode\\" rather than other tribes which only their leader (Remls, Tawlon and Gorbion) can use this mode on their ChouSeiShin. Sazer- Tarious is a rash postman, usually going in head first. He stumbled into being a Sazer after he was harassed by Sazer-Velsou; his temper and the powers within him made him transform. Immediately afterwards, he defeated Velsou. Often locking horns with Mika and the others, he doesn't quite like being made the leader, but he accepts the role. Tenma cares a lot about his comrades as well as about the world he lives. Despite frequently bickering with Mika, Tenma developed a serious crush on her as the show progresses. With his Knuckle Riser, Tenma transforms into , the Flame warrior under the sign of Sagittarius, his armour is shaped after a falcon in red colour. Sazer Tarious is the leader of Flame Tribe and also the leader of all 12 Gransazers. Sazer- Tarious' main weapon is the Falcon Bow, a bow and arrow set situated on the left wrist (in place of the Knuckle Riser). It can fire Flame-powered shots and even a continuous stream of fiery arrows. Its finishing attack called \\"Burning Falcon\\", which involves the shooting of a giant fiery arrow from the Falcon Bow. His second attack is the \\"Cosmo Punch\\", in which Sazer-Tarious jumps up, then spins towards his adversary before striking with a flaming outstretched fist. Sazer-Mithras is the tomboyish elder sister of Ken and the wise member of the Flame Tribe. Having helped Professor Horiguchi with his research, she was the first Sazer to be awakened. Her cool and reserved attitude often clashes with the bright personality of Tenma, but when push comes to shove she proves to be a true friend and is fond of him as well. With her Knuckle Riser, Mika transforms into , the flame warrior under the sign of Aries, with a white and red armour shaped after a swan. Her main weapons are the Swan Sector, a pair of fans. Its finishing attack, known as the \\"Brand Tornado\\", resembles a blast from a flamethrower tornado. Mika later makes a cameo appearance in Justirisers Episode 35, when she injured Shouta because she thought that he was a stalker. When asked by Yuka, she said that she had such skills because she used them in what she used to do, being a 'friend of justice'. Sazer-Lion is the younger brother of Mika by three years and last member of the Flame Tribe to be awakened; this happened when the Wind Tribe attacked the activated Garuda with Dolcross. He is the calm-and- collected pole of the tribe, a shy but caring and compassionate person who deeply loves his sister. After meeting Ran, he developed a crush on her, but he would never admit it. With his Knuckle Riser, Ken transforms into , the flame warrior under the sign of Leo, his dark red armour is shaped after a swallow with black colour on his arm. His main weapons are the Double Crescent, a pair of swords. Its finishing attack, called \\"Hien Zan\\" (Flying Swallow Slash), resembles a large wave of fire. =Wind Tribe= The are the first tribe that is fully assembled, deceived by Akelon who disguised as Saeki Karin to attack the other GranSazers, especially Flame Tribe. After they realized they were being deceived, they turned against Karin and allied with the other GranSazers to defeat her. The Wind Tribe armoured suits are all insect-shaped with purple-based colours and pilot the Wind-Driver Grand Vehicles. Sazer-Remls Back when he first met Karin, was awakened as Sazer Remls, tricked by the Akelon into fighting the Flame Tribe. Akira was the one who stood by Karin's side the longest, attacking his friends while still believing in and feeling for her. He may seem distant and cold but he is actually loyal and compassionate and if required, he can be a fierce fighter. He is the oldest GranSazer. He is also a doctor. With his Knuckle Riser, Akira transforms into , the wind warrior under the sign of Gemini, with armour shaped after a Japanese rhinoceros beetle in the colour of indigo (bluish purple). Sazer-Remls is also the leader of the Wind Tribe. Sazer-Remls' main weapon is the Iron Gale, a rifle cannon. Its finishing attack is called \\"Final Judgement\\", which is a concentrated ball of air. His second attack is the \\"Remls Tornado\\", a strong tornado blast from Remls' palm. Dentsuin later makes a cameo appearance in Justirisers Episode 30, as the doctor who assessed Mio's condition. Sazer-Velsou Recruited and recited by Karin as well, is the ambitious sports instructor of the Wind Tribe, aware of her unknown skills and with a dislike towards weaklings. Along with that, she is also rather calculating and intelligent. It was she who first doubted the motivations of Karin and became the first to leave the evil scientist, to be joined by Jin soon after. Under her personal training, Tappei has now become a freedom fighter. She fell in love with Naoto (Sazer-Tawlon). In the end of series, her marriage is shown with him. With her Knuckle Riser, Ryouko transforms into , the wind warrior under the sign of Aquarius; her magenta-coloured armour is shaped after a butterfly. Sazer-Velsou's main weapons are the Sel Cross, a pair of bucklers. Its finishing attack is called \\"Full Moon Slash\\", which is a vertical slash of magenta-tinted air that charges to the target. Sazer- Velsou's second attack is the \\"Velsou Illusion\\", a psychokinetic attack that disables her enemies. Sazer-Dail The final member of the Wind Tribe, , was bad books by Karin and joined them looking for fun rather than being devoted to his mission. He enjoys having his powers and playing around with them, always up for a challenge. Despite that, he enjoys teamwork and thus was soon convinced by Ryoko that the Sazers have to work as one big team. He often shows up just in time to level the odds. With his Knuckle Riser, Jin transforms into , the wind warrior under the sign of Libra; his purple armour is shaped after a stag beetle. Sazer-Dail's main weapons are the Axe Tagger, axe-like tonfas. Its finishing attack is called \\"Dai Senpuu Haa\\" (Great Whirlwind Slash), which is a horizontal tornado blast. =Earth Tribe= The are the third tribe to fully awaken. This tribe is the most divided one because each of the three members has a personality that conflicts with the others sometimes. This tribe is also a different one which the last member to be awakened is a woman, instead of man in other tribes. Karin tried to enlist the Earth Tribe into her group, but failed, causing the Earth Tribe to fight together with the Flame Tribe. Their armoured suits are shaped after four- legged mammals with yellow and orange-based colours, piloting the Earth-Driver Grand Vehicles. Sazer-Tawlon was once a famous and highly prized fighter who is now mostly retired from the spotlight, going back to teaching young talents the ways of self-defense. Often he is not to be found, for Naoto constantly seeks to become stronger and better, not just independently but in total isolation, despite the fact that he already is a powerhouse. He is also dedicated and tough. He would never give up, no matter how bad the odds are for him. In Justiriser episode 43, Naoto founded a gym where he meets Shouta, who reminds him of Tenma (Sazer-Tarious). When Shouta loses his Justi Powers, Naoto helps him regain his composure. He later sees Shouta become Riser Glen as he joins the other Justirisers and Demon Knight fighting their enemies, personally holding the Zokoals off before taking his leave. He fell in love with Ryoko (Sazer-Velsou) and they finally married on the last episode. With his Knuckle Riser, Naoto transforms into , the ground warrior under the sign of Taurus, whose armour is shaped after a bull in yellow colour. Sazer-Tawlon is the leader of the Earth Tribe. Sazer-Tawlon's main weapon is the Bull Cannon, a pair of shoulder cannons. Its finishing attack is called \\"Matador Burst\\", which is a charged shot. Sazer-Tragos The second and most reliable member of Earth Tribe, is a serious, dedicated and faithful policeman with a strong sense of justice. Without his control, Gou transformed for the first time when he was attacked by Akaki Junya, a guy that believed to be most wanted suspect in a robbery case, who was also Ran's childhood friend. After Gou realized that he is awakened as an Earth warrior, he immediately aligned with the Flame Tribe and fought some duels with Jin (Sazer-Dail). Within him, there is also a kind and honest side which came out when he was debating with Naoto on duty and priorities. He fell in love with the genius 18-year old scientist, Professor Aya Stacy. With his Knuckle Riser, Gou transforms into , the ground warrior under the sign of Capricorn where his armour is shaped after a goat with colour of light orange. Sazer-Tragos' main weapon is the Spiral Horn (derived from the shape of goat's horn), a drill arm. Its finishing attack is called \\"Penetrate Thunder\\", which is a thunder-like drill attack that requires him to jump at a height and dive immediately to attack the enemy. Sazer-Visuel The last member of Earth Tribe to be awakened, is a quirky and college-going young woman who met the Sazers when her childhood friend was accused of a crime which Gou and his policeman partner, Nanami were investigating. At first, she was abducted by Karin and the Wind Tribe to be their ally, but she eventually fled. In order to protect Gou (Sazer-Tragos) from a trigger-happy criminal named Ryuji Naito, she transformed into Sazer-Visuel for the first time. Despite her seemingly carefree nature, she can be very serious and devoted and can tap into the Crystal Slab, eventually revealing the full story behind the Ancient War. When Warp Monarch begins its final assault, Ran originally fell for the deception that she was a descendant of the Bosquito, but it was later found out that she is the Communicator and thus can communicate Warp Monarch itself for Earth's sake. With her Knuckle Riser, Ran transforms into , the ground warrior under the sign of Virgo; her armour is shaped after a female leopard in orange colour. Sazer-Visuel's main weapons are the Lady Claw, a pair of long and sharp claws. Its finishing attack is called \\"Night Scratch\\", which is a powerful claw slash. =Water Tribe= The appeared after the Akelon incident and was the last tribe to be fully assembled. Led by the strict and mistrusting war photographer Makoto, this tribe fought a while on their own. After they being fully assembled and awakened their ChouSeiShin, Leviathan, they joined the other Sazers. The armoured suits of Water Tribe are all shaped with sea animals with blue-based colours, piloting the Aqua-Driver Grand Vehicles. Sazer-Gorbion as Sazer-Gorbion is the leader of the Water Tribe. His past as a war photographer made him grow cautious and mistrusting, and initially he only trust his tribe members and not other tribes. He makes his debut as a Sazer when Leviathan becomes endangered due to Radia's presence and motives and promptly saves Tarious from impending death. He refused to work in the big team for a while longer, and his generally high dedication to what he thinks is right is often, but not always, a blessing to the other Sazers. With his Knuckle Riser, Makoto transforms into , the water warrior under the sign of Scorpio; his armour is shaped after a shark in royal blue colour. Sazer-Gorbion's main weapon is the Blast Saw, a serrated broadsword. Its finishing attack is called \\"Death Storm\\", which calls forth a small tsunami. Sazer-Gorbion's second attack is known as \\"Aqua Slasher\\". Sazer- Pisces is a caring and friendly nurse working at the same hospital as Akira. Right after their first encounter, Ai fell in love with him. Later that day, she and her long-time friend Tappei were attacked by Lucia, and Ai had to transform to protect herself. Just in time, she was saved by Akira (Sazer- Remls). Eventually she found out that Professor Wakui, a man she had known for years was her biological father, and this man was kidnapped by Logia. She followed them and freed him in time. Ai has a more than kind nature, even feeling mercy for those who tried to kidnap and kill her; but she is also serious and devoted to her mission. She is the youngest GranSazer. With her Knuckle Riser, Ai transforms into , the water warrior under the sign of Pisces, whose armour is shaped after a whale in cyan colour.

The opportunity finally came, he managed to transform himself and join his tribe members, making the Water Tribe fully assembled. Tappei is gentle and open-minded, ready when he is needed. With his Knuckle Riser, Tappei transforms into , the water warrior under the sign of Cancer, his armour is shaped after a manta ray in sky blue. Sazer-Gans' main weapon is the Karnikos (Greek; Great Victor), a double blade halberd. Its finishing attack is called \\"Taikai Shousetsudan (Ocean Roar Cut)\\", which shoots a stream of water. Allies=Professor Ichiro Horiguchi= is a space archaeologist who has become famous for his scientific studies. His analysis of some ancient crystals lead him to discovering the secret of the Gransazers, the Chou Seishin, and the Gransazer War. Many have sought this knowledge. His assistant, Mika, was awakened as Sazer Mithras. Her new partners, Ken and Tenma, were awakened as Gransazers later. He guides the Sazers by giving them information and leads. =Atsushi Misonogi= Although is a bureaucrat, he is also very mysterious benefactor to Dr. Horiguchi's Gransazer research. Eventually, Misonogi reveals himself to be head of the Department of National Defense, using Horiguchi to track down the Gransazers for his country's gain. But after seeing the severity of the alien threat, Misonogi decides to support the Gransazers in any way he can. =Masaki Wakui= is Ai Uozumi's long lost father, who throughout Ai's childhood, he's only known by the name . He led the team which repaired the Guntroller. =Souichiro Okita= leads the strike team which assists the Sazers during battle. He also commands the robot Yuuhi using a special head piece. =Jado= belongs to the Stonian race of Planet , who were chosen by Warp Monarch to attack Earth using the Mad Stone, a bomb- like rock of plutonium that the Stonians left on Earth ages ago. Refusing to let Earth be destroyed, Jado went to Earth to obtain the Mad Stone, taking over the body of , an old friend of Ryouko from her college who died on his way to Tokyo after returning from Africa. But as a result of being forced to keep his host alive, Jado is weakening to the point that he would eventually die. Once Ryouko gives him the Mad Stone, the Stonian assigned to destroy Earth attacked him to regain the Mad Stone. Soon after, Takumi regained control over his body long enough before he and Jado leave Earth with the Mad Stone, detonating it in deep space and instantly vaporized. =Freedo= is an Intergalactic cop from Planet sent to kill Kriminal for his partner's sake. Fatally wounded, Freedo entered the body of Jin's friend to continue pursuit with Jin forced to partner with the alien to ensure Shinji's safety and help. Once Kriminal is dead, Freedo leaves Shinji's body and departs into the afterlife. =Luka= Being of Planet , with the power to give her lifeforce to others, was sent to Earth by Belzeus to unknowingly unseal the Bosquito, summoning Gig Fighters to hold the monster off until Tarius arrives. After seeing that the Gransazers were nothing like the Bosquito and Tarious' resolve to protect the Earth, Luka questions her actions, and Tenma convinces her to leave Warp Monarch. However, in the end, Luka sacrifices herself to save Tenma's life. Warp Monarch The are an interstellar monarchy with various planets under them. The reason for Warp Monarch destroying the Earth's ancient civilization some 400 million ago was because of Bosquito running rampant on it. However, Belzeus, claiming that the humans are descended from the Bosquito, uses the Gransazers to encourage the Warp Monarch to finish the global genocide they started long ago. =Akelon= The race were the first alien menace to battle the Gransazers, their abilities include stretching arms, super speed, and shooting blasts of lightning. But their greatest strength is the Crystal Lens, a technology that can either heal/revive an Akelon or turn it into a . Karin Saeki An Akelon who impersonated the deceased physicist upon her arrival on Earth, two decades ago, to survive within Earth's atmosphere. Acting as a guide to the Wind Tribe, she convinced them that the other Sazers were a threat to the planet and must be destroyed. Subtly, she built a relationship with Akira that ensured his loyalty to even further tie him to her. Once Ryouko and Jin leave her, Karin reveals her true Akelon identity to kill them until Tenma, Mika, and Gou arrives in time to fight her off. While overseeing Remls attacking his teammates, Karin fights Tarius until the Wind Tribe notice the explosion of their fight, with Akira seeing Karin for as she really is, revealing she fell in love with the human and offered to spare his life. But in spite of his own love for her, Remls is forced to kill her to save Tarious, knocking her off the building to her death. However, she came to life before her body could be autopsied by the national defense group. Making her way to Ryujin Mountain, Karin summoned her UFO to heal her injuries before going after Sazer Tawlon and severely wounding him to call out the Gransazers. After being manhandled by the Fire Tribe, Karin assumes her Nova-Beast form and destroys the city, as Garuda and Dolcruz are summoned to fight her. Though she had the upper hand against the two Chouseishin, Karin retreats to the valley hill to heal her burn injuries by Garuda, taking Akira into the beast for one last chance to join her before she resumes her attack. After Remls breaks free from her body, the assembled Gransazers managed to destroy Karin's UFO before she herself is destroyed by the three Chouseishin. Clo-Akelon From the remains of Karin, Tsubaki of the JSDF science division begins to secretly mass-produce stronger that would serve as bio-weapons to ensure Japan would be a greater world power. Test Subject One was sent after Shiroi Kuga to reclaim the Crystal Lens when confronted by Tarius and was later destroyed. But once the Crystal Lens is back in Tsubaki's grasp, Test Subject Two turns on his creators upon being exposed to the Crystal Lens, stealing it while killing any soldier in his way of escape. But once losing the Crystal Lens, the Fire Tribe Gransazers arrive in time to drive the clone off with Tsubaki's platoon in pursuit. However, the Akelon Clone manages to reclaim the Crystal Lens and transforms into form. The monster was slowed down by Youhei, as it destroys the monster's crystal lens. The Chouseishin arrive, and Daisazer finishes the clone off. Ruby Though an agent of Warp Monarch, intended to stop Belzeus' scheme by heading to Earth to find Ran. Though thought as an enemy because of Karin's actions, Ruby reveals she's on the Gransazers' side when she saves Ran. Wounded while protecting Ran from Algol, Ruby is taken the JSDF. Once healed, she help Ran awaken as the Communicator to become the vessel of communication between Earth and the Warp Monarch high council. =The Impactors= After Karin's death, the from Planet Impactor are entrusted with the mission to destroy Earth at all costs. The Impactors' culture is centered on honor and combat, using cards to switch between human form and fighting form. In the first part, Lucia and Radia were sent to use a meteor to wipe out Shinkujira Island, in order to destroy the final Chouseishin Leviathan before going after the other Chousishin. However, the meteor was hindered by Cloud Dragon and the fragments unearthed Leviathan instead. After the Water Tribe reveal themselves and awaken Levithan to kill Radia, Logia reveals himself. But after the plan with Guntras fails, the Impactors are ordered by the Warp Monarch to cease their attack on Earth. Logia is the lead commander of the Impactors, entrusted with the mission to destroy Earth at all costs, following his kind's code of honor, and armed with the Hiro-Sniper gun. Assuming the guise of , he posed as Wakui's assistant to get the Guntroller to use Guntras in his Solar Annilation, using the giant robot's oxygen supply to make the sun go supernova and kill everyone. But Lucia was wounded in episode 21, and Logia saved her as he has feelings for her as well. However, the Guntroller has fallen into the Gransazer's hand, the mission ends an absolute failure and ordered to fall back by his superior. However, Logia summons DaiLogian to Earth and use it to destroy the Gransazers once and for all for the sake of his fallen comrades, taking out Tawlon, Remls, before going after Gorbion in a plan to upset Tarious. But the Pisces and Gans' interference saved their leader as he decides to wait for the Flame Tribe for a match between Garuda and DaiLogia before the others arrive to form DaiSazer. But when defeated by Tarius, Logia turns himself into a suicide bomber to taking the Sazer with him as they leave Earth's orbit. However, Logia drops Tenma at the last second once realizing this action would go against his pride as an Impactor. The bomb however, went off and Logia went to Hell. However, he survived his suicide and resurfaces upon regaining Dailogian and his Hiro-Sniper from the JDSF's Scientific Research Lab, beginning his vendetta against the Gransazers by kidnapping Ryouko and Ran and capturing Tappei, leaving them at the mercy of a time-bomb while he goes after Tarius to personally kill him. But when the plan goes array, Logia summons DaiLogian to crush Tarius as the Yuuhi arrives to hold him at bay under reinforcements arrive in the GranVehicles and drive him off. Logia later resumes his attack at the JD Weapon Institute to get Okito and Yuuhi under his control to hold Daisazer while weakened. But the plan fails and Logia goes to hell again after Dailogian is damaged by Daisazer, found by Belzeus who offers him another chance by increasing his power and reviving Logia in return for the Crystal Slab by taking Mika and Professor Horiguchi as hostages to force Tenma to hand deliver it to him alone. Once he smashes the Crystal Slab, unaware that it's a fake, Logia fight Tenma to his heart's content until the other Gransazers arrive to free Mika as the Professor Horiguchi as they even the odds and force Logia to use DaiLogian to fight Daisazer until Belzeus is tired of Logia's arrogance, forcing him out of DaiLogian as it leaves under Belzeus control. Refusing to give up, Logia abducts Mika who tends to his wounds before he lets her go as he goes to hunt down the Belzeus-controlled DaiLogian and reclaim it as he and Tarious settle things in a one-on-one fist fight. But the fight ends in a draw as a satisfied Logia leaves, later returning to aid them in fighting Belzeus, though he still sees Tenma as an eternal rival. After that Logia realize that he was betrayed by Belzeus, he supports the rest of the Gransazers in their final battle before arresting Belzeus. At the end, and bids farewell to Tenma. Lucia , who came to earth along with Radia, is a swift and cunning fighter who assumes the form of a woman in her twenties with a red streak in her hair, wearing a green leotard and a cape. In her black-armored form, Lucia uses the V-Sword as both a boomerang and as a sword. She also loves Logia and would do anything for him. After Radia dies, Lucia swears to kill the Gransazers in spite of Logia ordering her not to act. She attacks Samura while he was tracking her, fighting Tenma and Gou. After getting scarred by Ai, Lucia attempts to get revenge on her, both Ran and Mika arrive to Ai's aid and defeat Lucia, mortally wounding her and taking her to the hospital in hopes of healing her. But as her body is beyond human medicine, Lucia would eventually die were it not for Logia saving her after she learns that he has feelings for her as well. After being healed, Lucia learns that she is no longer to continue the mission. However, going against the order, she use Accelerator to increase her power, turning into a giant version of herself in spite that that Accelerator's long-term effect would make her into a mindless monster and eventually kill her. Though she over-powered the Chouseishin with her cloaking and clone abilities before enlarging herself even more, Lucia is outmatched by Daisazer with its pilots stopping it in time before it kills her. However, Lucia succumbs to the Accelerator's effect as dies, leaving behind her card for Logia to find. Radia , who came to earth along with Lucia, is a hot-headed and fierce fighter who assumes the guise of a blond haired man in silvery attire. He has romantic feelings for Lucia, though having ill feelings towards Logia in spite of his forced-respect for him. In his silver-armored fighting form, Radia uses the enormous Mega Axe in his armor. He presented an interest in the Gransazers, deeming them too weak to stand a chance against him in one-on-one fights. But Gorbion's interference forces Radia to escape, swearing a vendetta on Gorbion since. But when Lucia is wounded, Radia decides to complete the mission on his own, fighting Gorbion and Pisces until he enlarges into a giant as Gans arrives and the gathered Water Tribe awaken Leviathan. But Radia's pride is his undoing when he refuses to retreat from the fight and is killed by Leviathan. =Bisil= The underhanded are sent to destroy Earth, sending an operative and a spy to test the first Stage in their dimensional transport system, using it to bring humans where they eventually disintegrate instantly. After the Gransazers learn of this plot, the Bisilians kill their operative before retreating to begin Stage Two. Once learning the location of the Dimensional Transport Machine, the others go to fight the Bisil Soldiers while Tarius activates the machine's self-destruct. Soon after, Garuda engages the Bisilian mothership in an aerial dogfight and destroys it. Asami Yoshioka A Bislian spy who assumed the guise of , a girl who died a six months ago of illness. She was said to hinder the Gransazers. From being with Ken and befriending him, Ayumi realizes that Earth shouldn't be destroyed though she is force. After Ran, Asami apologizes for deceiving him and is mortally wounded by a Bizal Soldier for betraying her race, revealing the location of the Dimensional Transport system as she thanks Ken with her dying breath, reduced to wisps of light. =Omega= A Warp Monarch android created in the Omega Project, as anti-Gransazer weapon hidden within Earth after the battle eons ago in case the Gransazers resurface with a fail-safe built into him that would activate after seeing all twelve to self-destruct. Uncovered from a Croatian tomb and brought to the JSDF Weapons Institute, Omega whirled to life and when Mika touched him, having no memory of his past. He later began to explore Tokyo in search for Mika so she can help him gather data of the present-day society. By the time he meets Ran, Omega regains his memories of the past and is compelled to fight Mithras, unable to kill her. Confused, Omega decides to report to Warp Monarch, ordered to gather all the Gransazers after his AI is reprogramed without feeling and at full power. After getting the JSDF's secrets, Omega battles the Flame Tribe, Dail, Tragos, and Visuel before assuming a giant monster form to destroy Yuuhi. Mithras fights Omega in Garuda until the other Chousienshin are summon and Daisazer is formed and heavily damages Omega, restoring his AI as he apologizes to Mika and runs off as the entire Gransazer team runs to him as an act of redemption. =Garbans= From planet Garba, the are the final alien menace the Gransazers battle with. Belzeus is member of the Warp Monarch council and leader of both the Garban and the Earth Invasion Force, the one who set up the war after making his fellow member believe the human race descend from the Bosquito race. In truth he wanted to take over Earth in order to gain a vital place in conquering the universe. To that end, he creates supports to his claim by having using Logia to destroy Crystal Slab to hide the truth and Luka to resurrect the last Bosquito to give Warp Monarch to attack Earth in full fury. When both failed, Belzeus decides to capture Ran and kill her before her abilities as the Communicator fully manifest, sending his Garba soldiers to exterminate both her and Ruby. Belzeus then arrives on Earth to personally kill Ran, defeating Pisces, Velsou, and Tragos. But when Ran's power as the Communication are finally invoked and contacted to Warp Monarch's will, Belzeus' plans are revealed as Warp Moncarh allows the Gransazers to destroy both Cabryon and the Garban mothership. With his plans ruined, Belzeus is knocked out by Logia as he takes the Garban to be brought before the Warp Monarch council to face judgement. Brighton A Garban Emissary sent to Earth during a 3 day ceasefire, fakes sympathy for Earth's safety by asking the JSDF to let him investigate the Gransazers, finding Ran as Communicator and claiming her to have Bosquito DNA so that he would give them reason to let him take her, thus leaving Earth with a Communicator to contact Warp Monarch. When ordered by Belzeus to kill Ran before her power can awaken, Brighton summons Algol to carry out the task. But when Algol fails, Brighton reveals his true colors as Troius sneak attacks the city. Later, while the others destroy Algol, Tarious goes after Brighton as the Garban pretends to beg for his life so he can kill Tarious with his guard down, only to be shot by Logia. Algol Serving under Brighton, , is sent to kill Ran, though Ruby stops him when he overpowers Tarius and the Earth Tribe. After Brighton brings Ran to Algol, Tenma saves Ran as he battles Agol. When Ran finds Agol to have him kill her when Ruby interferes again as Tarious and Lion arrive to save the two. Algol later attacks the JSDF as the Gransazers arrive and kill him. =Gorgion= Sent by Belzeus to exterminate Ruby before she could awaken Ran's power, attacks the JSDF before being hindered in his mission by Dail, who manages to defeat before injuring Velsou. But Tarious arrives to hold him off with aid from Gorbion and Relms as Mithras takes Ryouko and Ruby away. However, Logia turns the tables as he and Tarius double-team Gorgion and the Impactor about to kill him when Tarious' intervened, allowing Gorgion to escape. He is given one last chance to redeem himself by using Cabryon as a distraction to keep the Gransazers off his back while he kills Ruby without interference. After finding Ruby, Gorgion is halted by the Flame Tribe. But after an attempt to use Mithras as a shield, activates the bomb on his person to complete his mission. =Gig Fighters= The foot soldiers of the Warp Monarch, the spawned from special devices often carried by its high-ranking members. They are often used to hassle the protagonists, or other duties such as supervise prisoners. =Other aliens= * : From Planet , he has the power to enter peoples' bodies. He attempted to use the body of professor Hijikata to have Horiguchi leave the Gransazers. But the failed and Sturcus decides to possess the professor and destroy the team from the inside-out, only retreat after being hit by the Gransazers' Formation Zero attack. * : A robotic alien from planet Kilardo, he assumes the form of a man in black and is sent to destroy the crystal recorder in the possession of Professor Aya Stacey, the eighteen-year-old Noble-Prize winner. Once he succeeds, he tries to kill Aya and Gou when Tarious and Dail intervene before Tragos delivers the deathblow on the alien robot with Tarius finishing the Kilardoian off. * The ghost of an alien soldier who died during Warp Monarch's war against Earth. Filled with undying rage towards humans and unaware that he died, Fedora possessed the body of Henry Wakasugi to continue the orders he received ages ago. It was once his identity is revealed, Tarious uses the crystal slab to make Fedora realized that he's dead, leaving Henry's body to finally rest. * : An alien from planet Gadaru armed with the Dead Spear, he was a scientist sent by Warp Monarch to convert humans into mindless slaves, using Ran's friends as test specimens in his research. But Ran's friends are freed from the Gadaruian's control as Tarious battles the alien and kills him with Visuel's aid. * : An alien felon with no relation to Warp Monarch, he escaped to Earth to feed on the energy there. Armed with a pistol he stole from Freedo's partner, Kriminel can absorb any heat-based energy source to heal himself and increase his power, firing stored energy from the orbs on his chest. After losing to Dail, Kriminel attracts the Fire Tribe's attention as Tenma and Mika fight him and worsen the matter. But once Dail breaks Kriminel's barrier, Freedo delivers the death-shot. * : A Warp Monarch agent from planet Gorfin, he enters the body of Mick the dolphin at the Sea Paradise aquarium to influence the other dolphins with his hyper frequency to attack humans with sound waves. But thanks to Mayu, Mick exorcises the Gorfinian as Gans fights before Tarious and Gorbion arrive and the dolphins use their own hyper frequency to weaken the alien as Gans finishes him off. * : A giant alien monster sent from the Fleet to attack the Earth once the ceasefire ended. Dolcruz and Leviathan battle the beast with aid of the GranVehicles and Yuuhi. But the fight ends with Dolcruz heavily damaged, Yuuhi dismantled, and Tappei wounded. After Garuda got damaged as well, Guntras and Cloud Dragon intervene and destroy Troius. * : Arriving in a fireball, Cabryon is used by Gorgion to attack the JSDF to draw the Gransazers out into the open to complete his mission. Carbion succeeds in damaging Guntras to keep the Gransazers from forming DaiSazer and wrecks the other Chouseishin while appearing to kill Tenma. But once Warp Monarch acknowledges the truth about Earth, the Chouseishin are restored and form DaiSazer to kill Cabyron. Bosquito The is an alien construct that absorbs any lifeform in its grasp, for nourishment, into order to reproduce asexually, and able to assimilate the energy of its clone spawn when they die. It is feared across the universe, as Warp Monarch couldn't control the Bosqutio when it came to Earth, resulting in the birth of the Gransazers to counter it and the War that destroyed ancient human civilization along with the propaganda set up to link the Bosquito to Earth's people. Though nearly wiped out, the Bosquito was sealed away, within the Kabuto Mountain, until Luka revived it on Belzeus' order, with no idea who she was reviving, until it was too late. Being able to use any attack used by the Gransazers, the Bosquito overpowers the Flame Tribe and later attacks a village, feeding on the people there, before using the TV to find ideal locations to feed on next. After evading the Wind Tribe, the Bosquito reproduces a child before fighting the Gransazers and is killed by them. The surviving child began to feed when Makoto and Jin arrive and were attacked as Tauron arrives to support them before the Bosquito multiplies itself as the Flame Tribe arrive to counter the second Bosquito until Yuuhi blasts it. Absorbing its clone, the Bosquito takes the controls for Yuuhi and uses it against the Gransazers, stealing Garuda when the Flame Tribe summons it. Levithan and Gunceasar are summoned to weaken Garuda so eject the Bosquito, who starts to absorb the floral life energy to regain its strength and create two clones of itself. After the others destroy the clones, the orbs they left behind are reabsorbed into the original Bosquito as it evolves into a giant monster. After Tarius uses one of Lion's Crescents to take the ruby on its chest, the source of its power, the Bosquito is destroyed by DaiSazer. However, as revealed in the Seishin crossover (Chousei Kantai Sazer-X: The Movie), another Bosquito existed within the monster Bulgario, released when the monster was destroyed at sea, absorbing the JustiPower in Sazer Island, so it can duplicate itself and can disguise themselves as impostor Justirisers. They are all destroyed by Gransazers, Justirisers and Sazer-X but quickly absorbed into the phantom ship so that it would form into Mammoth-Bosquito dragon. The Mammoth-Bosquito is destroyed by Great-Lio (piloted by Lio-Sazer) using the final move, Howling Crush, which the power of Gransazers, Justirisers and Sazer-X combined into the finishing attack to destroy the monster. ChouSeiShin The ChouSeiShin (Ultra Star Gods or Super Star Gods) are the most powerful weapons of the ancient Earth Civilization. They remained dormant on Earth until the GranSazers were awakened, and reactivated the long-lost relics. Each Tribe possesses one of the four ChouSeiShin, which can be summoned by setting all of their Knuckle-Risers to \\"ChouSeiShin Mode\\". One member of the Tribe can then \\"Dive In\\" and board the machine by setting their Knuckle-Riser to \\"Boarding Mode\\". Furthermore, by setting their Knuckle-Riser to \\"Sazer Gear Mode\\" the pilot can equip their ChouSeiShin with a large version of their personal weapon. Each ChouSeiShin has two modes, which can be switched between with a simple transformation. In \\"Live Mode\\", they resemble animals and possess incredible maneuverability. In Warrior Mode, they resemble bipedal mecha, losing most of their speed, but gaining immense attacking power. =ChouSeiShin Garuda= is the Flame Tribe's ChouSeiShin, the second to be awaken from its slumber in Houhou Mountain. In Live Mode, Garuda is shaped after a phoenix and attacks with his guns located under its wings where its legs are, firing lasers and energy beams. Garuda can also tackle enemies after engulfing himself in flames. In Warrior Mode, Garuda mostly relies on the 'Garu Claw', which are his talons on the back of his fists, for close-range combat. He performs his finishing move \\"Fire Bird Slash\\" with them. Garuda can also summon a sword called Burning Saber for armed melee combat. Tarious' Sazer Gear equips Garuda with a giant version of the Falcon Bow, and Lion's Sazer Gear equips Garuda with giant versions of the Double Crescents. =ChouSeiShin Dorcrus= also known as Dorcrus or Dorcrus is the Wind Tribe's ChouSeiShin, the first to be awakened from its slumber in Kabuto Mountain. In Live Mode, Dorcrus is shaped after a European rhinoceros beetle and attacks with his multitude of cannons as well as with full tackles. In Warrior Mode, Dorcrus uses his large array of cannons and blasters to perform various attacks. His finishing move, \\"Herakles Hurricane\\", fires his entire arsenal of cannons and blasters simultaneously. Remls' Sazer Gear equips Dorcrus with a giant version of the Iron Gale on his head, since Dolcruz does not have proper hands to hold objects (in theory). =ChouSeiShin GunCaesar= is the Earth Tribe's ChouSeiShin, the third to be awaken from its slumber in the Shishioh Desert. In Live Mode, GunCaesar is shaped after a liger and attacks with his cannons as well as with his claws. In Warrior Mode, GunCaesar uses his cannons, the Liger Riots, as hand blasters. He performs his finishing move, \\"Gravity Burst\\", with them. Tawlon's Sazer Gear equips GunCaesar with a giant version of the Bull Cannon. =ChouSeiShin Leviathan= is the Water Tribe's ChouSeiShin, the last to be awaken from its slumber in Shinkujira Island when the Impactors arrive on Earth. In Live Mode, Leviathan has a whale-like shape and uses his fins for ramming attacks, as well as firing his two cannons at the fins. In Warrior Mode, Leviathan is armed with the Maelstrom Blades which can be used for his finishing move \\"High Tide Break\\". Furthermore, he is equipped with the Ocean Shield which can be used for his another move \\"Mirage Shield\\" which can multiply for defence purposes. Gorbion's Sazer Gear equips Leviathan with a giant version of the Blast Saw. =ChouSeiShin Guntras= is controlled by an advanced AI, superior to the other ChouSeiShin to have a will of his own. Initially hidden away in the Andes, referred as the \\"Great Shadow\\" in Peruvian legend, Guntras resurfaced when his Guntroller is repaired and Logia controls him, planning to use Guntras' oxygen fuel supply to collide with the Sun and trigger a nova strong enough to evaporate Earth, after killing the GranSazers first. Tenma eventually got the Guntroller and freed Guntras, who joined up with Cloud Dragon as an ally to the Sazers. Later Guntras is revealed to be created in order to combine the four ChouSeiShin into one giant super robot (DaiSazer). Guntras is armed with an array of deadly weapons, among them a laser battery on his chest, a cannon on his forehead and missile launchers on his body. He can fire and immediately replace his fists in his Twin Crusher attack, and his powerful feet can create devastating shockwaves in his Land Shake attack. =Fusion Beast-King DaiSazer= is the assembled form of the four Tribes' ChouSeishin, along with ChouSeishin Guntras. Guntras forms the main body, head and feet; Garuda for chest, cranium, and back; Dorcrus for the legs; GunCaesar for the right arm and the shoulder cannons; and Leviathan for the left arm and the tail. Combined, DaiSazer has a very aggressive and archaic mind of its own. All four pilots have to focus in order to control DaiSazer. DaiSazer is a very deadly creature and it is armed with a deflector as well as a laser array on its chest, but DaiSazer mostly relies on brute force to deal with its opponents. Its attacks include: 'Rapid Sazer', which fires the shoulder cannons on its back; 'Blast Pressure', unleashing a blast of fire from Guncaesar's mouth on its right arm; 'God Sphere', firing energy beams from its eyes. Its finishing move is 'Hyper Burst', which unleashes the full power of Guntras and the 4 ChouSeiShin combined through the laser array on its chest. =ChouSeiJuuren Cloud Dragon= ,translated into English as Ultra Star Beast Carrier Cloud Dragon, is as old as the ChouSeiShin, another remnant of the ancient civilization and residing within the ozone layer of the Earth to protect it from alien invaders, implanted with a DNA of humanity to start back up the human race and an AI modeled after a woman from ancient civilization. She only descends from the ozone layer if the ChouSeiShin are summoned or are in need of her help for repairs. The Cloud Dragon is designed for combat support and repairs the ChouSeishin after they suffered battle damage and rendered immobile as a result, in which a sky whirlpool is created to collect the damaged ChouSeiShin and loads them onto one of the 4 storage pads (for the ChouSeiShin of each Tribe in the order of Flame (Garuda), Wind (Dorcrus), Earth (GunCaesar) and Water (Leviathan) respectively) on its body for repairs and restoration in outer space (the first such repairs is done onto the Flame ChouSeiShin Garuda by restoring its damaged left wing), upon which they can be launched straight from the colossal Dragon's storage pads once fully repaired and when the Gransazers summon them. Prior to the final battle, Cloud Dragon formally introduces herself to the GranSazers before telling them they have the answer to stop the attack on Earth. The Cloud Dragon's attack is the Galactica Prominence Cannon, a devastating blaster capable of blowing an entire asteroid into pieces. Inside cloud dragon there are Granvehicle which is one for each tribe's member. granvehicle of flame tribe is flame driver, wind tribe's vehicle is wind driver, earth tribe's is earth driver, and the water tribe's is aqua driver, which is one for each gransazer. With gransazers nuckle riser there is granvehicle mode. The Sazers who dives in they on's their granvehicle mode and says granvehicle launch and dives in. on the cloud dragon the place where these granvehicles launch is where Guntras stands in front is place where granvehicles launch which is one for everyone. Cloud Dragon's Zodiac sign is unofficial 13th sign, Ophiuchus. Other mecha=DaiLogian= Dailogian is Logia's personal mecha. It is a black humanoid robot patterned after a wolf and its power is almost equal to Daisazer's. Unlike his subordinates, Lucia and Radia, Logia cannot grow into a giant; instead, he summons his mecha, which is always on standby in outer space, and which Logia alone can summon. It can absorb beam attacks through its chest and redirect them back to the opponents. It first fought with Daisazer and was defeated when Daisazer ripped off its arm. The second time was when Logia and Tenma fought one on one in their respective mechas with Tenma barely securing the victory. After DaiLogian was defeated, it was taken by the Japan Self- Defense Force for study. It reactivated, then busted out of the Japan Self- Defense Force holding area, when Logia returned to Earth to seek vengeance against the Sazers. Afterwards, Logia used it as a mode of transport. =Yuuhi= The was the result of the JSDF reverse engineering DaiLogian so they can support the Gransazers' Chouseishin. Remote controlled by a voice- command headgear, the Yuuhi is launched from an underground bunker. It can access numerous weapons, a 120-mm dual cannon as well as two arrays of six missile launchers each. Prior to the final battle, Yuuhi was broken into pieces after fighting Troius. =Type-05 GS Assist Tank \\"Asahi\\"= Asahi is Yuuhi's support mecha. It vaguely resembles an M4 Sherman.

Videotelephony, McGraw-Hill, 2002. Retrieved from the FreeDictionary.com website, January 9, 2010 A videophone is a telephone with a video display, capable of simultaneous video and audio for communication between people in real time. Videoconferencing implies the use of this technology for a group or organizational meeting rather than for individuals, in a videoconference.Mulbach et al, 1995. pg. 291. Telepresence may refer either to a high-quality videotelephony system (where the goal is to create the illusion that remote participants are in the same room) or to meetup technology, which goes beyond video into robotics (such as moving around the room or physically manipulating objects). Videoconferencing has also been called \\"visual collaboration\\" and is a type of groupware. While development of video conferencing started in the late 19th century, the technology only became available to the public starting in the 1930s. These early demonstrations were installed at \\"booths\\" in post offices and shown at various world expositions. It took until 1970 for AT&T; to launch the first true video conferencing system, wherein anyone could subscribe to the service and have the technology in their home or office. Videotelephony also included \\"image phones\\" which would exchange still images between units every few seconds over conventional plain old telephone service (POTS) lines, essentially the same as slow-scan TV. The development of advanced video codecs, more powerful CPUs, and high-bandwidth Internet telecommunication services in the late 1990s allowed videophones to provide high quality low- cost colour service between users almost any place in the world where the Internet is available. Although not as widely used in everyday communications as audio-only and text communication, useful applications include sign language transmission for deaf and speech-impaired people, distance education, telemedicine, and overcoming mobility issues. It is also used in commercial and corporate settings to facilitate meetings and conferences, typically between parties that already have established relationships. News media organizations have begun to use desktop technologies like Skype to provide higher-quality audio than the cellular phone network, and video links at much lower cost than sending professional equipment or using a professional studio. More popular videotelephony technologies use the Internet rather than the traditional landline phone network, even accounting for modern digital packetized phone network protocols, and even though videotelephony software commonly runs on smartphones.  History  Video telephony predicted to be in use by the year 2000, as envisioned in 1910 (artist's conception) Video telephone booth, 1930 The concept of videotelephony was first conceived in the late 1870s both in the United States and in Europe, although the basic sciences to permit its very earliest trials would take nearly a half century to be discovered. This was first embodied in the device which came to be known as the video telephone, or videophone, and it evolved from intensive research and experimentation in several telecommunication fields, notably electrical telegraphy, telephony, radio, and television. Simple analog videophone communication could be established as early as the invention of the television. Such an antecedent usually consisted of two closed-circuit television systems connected via coax cable or radio. An example of that was the German Reich Postzentralamt (post office) video telephone network serving Berlin and several German cities via coaxial cables between 1936 and 1940.\\"German Postoffice To Use Television‚ÄìTelephone For Its Communication System\\", (Associated Press) The Evening Independent, St. Petersburg, Fl, September 1, 1934Peters, C. Brooks, \\"Talks On 'See-Phone': Television Applied to German Telephones Enables Speakers to See Each Other...\\", The New York Times, September 18, 1938 The development of video conferencing as a subscription service started in the latter half of the 1920s in the United Kingdom and the United States, spurred notably by John Logie Baird and AT&T;'s Bell Labs. This occurred in part, at least with AT&T;, to serve as an adjunct supplementing the use of the telephone. A number of organizations believed that videotelephony would be superior to plain voice communications. Attempts at using normal telephony networks to transmit slow-scan video, such as the first systems developed by AT&T; Corporation, first researched in the 1950s, failed mostly due to the poor picture quality and the lack of efficient video compression techniques. The first manned space flights, NASA used two radio- frequency (UHF or VHF) video links, one in each direction. TV channels routinely use this type of videotelephony when reporting from distant locations. The news media were to become regular users of mobile links to satellites using specially equipped trucks, and much later via special satellite videophones in a briefcase. This technique was very expensive, though, and could not be used for applications such as telemedicine, distance education, and business meetings. Decades of research and development culminated in the 1970 commercial launch of AT&T;'s Picturephone service, available in select cities. However, the system was a commercial failure, chiefly due to consumer apathy, high subscription costs, and lack of network effect‚Äîwith only a few hundred Picturephones in the world, users had extremely few contacts they could actually call, and interoperability with other videophone systems would not exist for decades. Multiple user videoconferencing first being demonstrated with Stanford Research Institute's NLS computer technology (1968) Very expensive videoconferencing systems continued to evolve throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Proprietary equipment, software, and network requirements gave way to standards-based technologies that were available for anyone to purchase at a reasonable cost. Only in the late 20th century with the advent of powerful video codecs combined with high- speed Internet broadband and ISDN service did videotelephony become a practical technology for regular use. = Digital = Practical digital videotelephony was made possible only with advances in video compression, due to the impractically high bandwidth requirements of uncompressed video. To achieve Video Graphics Array (VGA) quality video (480p resolution and 256 colors) with raw uncompressed video, it would require a bandwidth of over 92Mbps. The most important compression technique that enabled practical digital videotelephony and videoconferencing is the discrete cosine transform (DCT). The DCT, a form of lossy compression, was conceived in 1972 by Nasir Ahmed, who developed the algorithm with T. Natarajan and K. R. Rao at the University of Texas in 1973. The DCT algorithm became the basis for the first practical video coding standard that was useful for online videoconferencing, H.261, standardised by the ITU-T in 1988, and subsequent H.26x video coding standards. In the 1980s, digital telephony transmission networks became possible, such as with ISDN networks, assuring a minimum bit rate (usually 128 kilobits/s) for compressed video and audio transmission. During this time, there was also research into other forms of digital video and audio communication. Many of these technologies, such as the Media space, are not as widely used today as videoconferencing but were still an important area of research.Robert Stults, Media Space, Xerox PARC, Palo Alto, CA, 1986.Harrison, Steve. Media Space: 20+ Years of Mediated Life , Springer, 2009, , . The first dedicated systems started to appear as ISDN networks were expanding throughout the world. One of the first commercial videoconferencing systems sold to companies came from PictureTel Corp., which had an initial public offering in November, 1984. In 1984, Concept Communication in the United States replaced the hundred pound, US$100,000 computers necessary for teleconferencing, with a $12,000 circuit board that doubled the video frame rate from 15 to 30 frames per second, and which reduced the equipment to the size of a circuit board fitting into standard personal computers. The company also secured a patent for a codec for full-motion videoconferencing, first demonstrated at AT&T; Bell Labs in 1986. Global Schoolhouse students communicating via CU-SeeMe, with a video framerate between three and nine frames per second (1993). Videoconferencing systems throughout the 1990s rapidly evolved from very expensive proprietary equipment, software, and network requirements to a standards-based technology readily available to the general public at a reasonable cost. Finally, in the 1990s, Internet Protocol-based videoconferencing became possible, and more efficient video compression technologies were developed, permitting desktop, or personal computer (PC)-based videoconferencing. In 1992 CU-SeeMe was developed at Cornell by Tim Dorcey et al. In 1995 the first public videoconference between North America and Africa took place, linking a technofair in San Francisco with a techno- rave and cyberdeli in Cape Town. At the 1998 Winter Olympics opening ceremony in Nagano, Japan, Seiji Ozawa conducted the Ode to Joy from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony simultaneously across five continents in near-real-time. While videoconferencing technology was initially used primarily within internal corporate communication networks, one of the first community service usages of the technology started in 1992 through a unique partnership with PictureTel and IBM Corporations which at the time were promoting a jointly developed desktop based videoconferencing product known as the PCS/1. Over the next 15 years, Project DIANE (Diversified Information and Assistance Network) grew to utilize a variety of videoconferencing platforms to create a multi-state cooperative public service and distance education network consisting of several hundred schools, libraries, science museums, zoos and parks, and many other community oriented organizations. The Kyocera VP-210 Visual Phone was the first commercial mobile videophone (1999). Kyocera conducted a two-year development campaign from 1997 to 1999 that resulted in the release of the VP-210 Visual Phone, the first mobile colour videophone that also doubled as a camera phone for still photos.Kyocera visual phone VP-210, Japan, 1999, Science & Society Picture Library, retrieved August 9, 2013.First mobile videophone introduced, CNN.com website, May 18, 1999. The camera phone was the same size as similar contemporary mobile phones, but sported a large camera lens and a 5 cm (2 inch) colour TFT display capable of displaying 65,000 colors, and was able to process two video frames per second.Yegulalp, Serdar. Camera phones: A look back and forward, Computerworld, May 11, 2012. Videotelephony was popularized in the 2000s, via free Internet services such as Skype and iChat, web plugins supporting H.26x video standards, and on-line telecommunication programs that promoted low cost, albeit lower quality, videoconferencing to virtually every location with an Internet connection. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev attending the Singapore APEC summit, holding a videoconference with Rashid Nurgaliyev via a Tactical MXP, after an arms depot explosion in Russia (2009) With the rapid improvements and popularity of the Internet, videotelephony has become widespread through the deployment of video-enabled mobile phones such as 2010's iPhone 4, plus videoconferencing and computer webcams which utilize Internet telephony. In the upper echelons of government, business, and commerce, telepresence technology, an advanced form of videoconferencing, has helped reduce the need to travel. In May 2005, the first high definition video conferencing systems, produced by LifeSize Communications, were displayed at the Interop trade show in Las Vegas, Nevada, able to provide video at 30 frames per second with a 1280 by 720 display resolution.Polycom High-Definition (HD) Video Conferencing Polycom introduced its first high definition video conferencing system to the market in 2006. As of the 2010s, high definition resolution for videoconferencing became a popular feature, with most major suppliers in the videoconferencing market offering it. Technological developments by videoconferencing developers in the 2010s have extended the capabilities of video conferencing systems beyond the boardroom for use with hand-held mobile devices that combine the use of video, audio and on-screen drawing capabilities broadcasting in real time over secure networks, independent of location. Mobile collaboration systems now allow people in previously unreachable locations, such as workers on an offshore oil rig, the ability to view and discuss issues with colleagues thousands of miles away. Traditional videoconferencing system manufacturers have begun providing mobile applications as well, such as those that allow for live and still image streaming.VCLink for Mobile Devices‚ÄîAVer Video Conferencing The highest ever video call (other than those from aircraft and spacecraft) took place on May 19, 2013, when British adventurer Daniel Hughes used a smartphone with a BGAN satellite modem to make a videocall to the BBC from the summit of Mount Everest, at above sea level.Callaham, John.

Everest Raises Thousands for Charity , Skype blog, June 24, 2013. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant increase in the use of videoconferencing. Berstein Research found that Zoom added more subscribers during the first two months of 2020 alone than in the entire year 2019. GoToMeeting had a 20 percent increase in usage, according to LogMeIn. UK based StarLeaf reported a 600 percent increase in national call volumes.  Major categories  A modern Avaya Nortel 1535 IP model broadband videophone (2008), using VoIP An older dual- display Polycom videoconferencing system (2008) USB webcam for PC Videotelephony can be categorized by its functionality, that is to its intended purpose, and also by its method of transmissions. Videophones were the earliest form of videotelephony, dating back to initial tests in 1927 by AT&T.; During the late 1930s, the post offices of several European governments established public videophone services for person-to-person communications utilizing dual cable circuit telephone transmission technology. In the present day, standalone videophones and UMTS video-enabled mobile phones are usually used on a person-to-person basis. Videoconferencing saw its earliest use with AT&T;'s Picturephone service in the early 1970s. Transmissions were analog over short distances, but converted to digital forms for longer calls, again using telephone transmission technology. Popular corporate video-conferencing systems in the present day have migrated almost exclusively to digital ISDN and IP transmission modes due to the need to convey the very large amounts of data generated by their cameras and microphones. These systems are often intended for use in conference mode, that is by many people in several different locations, all of whom can be viewed by every participant at each location. Telepresence systems are a newer, more advanced subset of videoconferencing systems, meant to allow higher degrees of video and audio fidelity. Such high-end systems are typically deployed in corporate settings. Mobile collaboration systems are another recent development, combining the use of video, audio, and on-screen drawing capabilities using newest generation hand-held electronic devices broadcasting over secure networks, enabling multi-party conferencing in real time, independent of location. A more recent technology encompassing these functions is TV cams. TV cams enable people to make video \\"phone\\" calls using video calling services, like Skype on their TV, without using a PC connection. TV cams are specially designed video cameras that feed images in real time to another TV camera or other compatible computing devices like smartphones, tablets and computers. Webcams are popular, relatively low cost devices which can provide live video and audio streams via personal computers, and can be used with many software clients for both video calls and videoconferencing.Solomon Negash, Michael E. Whitman. Editors: Solomon Negash, Michael E. Whitman, Amy B. Woszczynski, Ken Hoganson, Herbert Mattord. Handbook of Distance Learning for Real-Time and Asynchronous Information Technology Education , Idea Group Inc (IGI), 2008, p. 17, , . Note costing: \\"...students had the option to install a webcam on their end (a basic webcam costs about $40.00) to view the class in session.\\" Each of the systems has its own advantages and disadvantages, including video quality, capital cost, degrees of sophistication, transmission capacity requirements, and cost of use. = By cost and quality of service = From the least to the most expensive systems: * Web camera videophone and videoconferencing systems, either stand-alone or built-in, that serve as complements to personal computers, connected to other participants by computer and VoIP networks‚Äîlowest direct cost, assuming the users already possess computers at their respective locations. Quality of service can range from low to very high, including high definition video available on the latest model webcams. A related and similar device is a TV camera which is usually small, sits on top of a TV, and can connect to it via its HDMI port, similar to how a webcam attaches to a computer via a USB port. * Videophones‚Äîlow to midrange cost. The earliest standalone models operated over either plain old telephone service (POTS) lines on the PSTN telephone networks or more expensive ISDN lines, while newer models have largely migrated to Internet protocol line service for higher image resolutions and sound quality. Quality of service for standalone videophones can vary from low to high; * Huddle room or all-in-one systems ‚Äîlow to midrange cost, newer endpoint category based on standard videoconferencing systems, but defined by the camera, microphone(s), speakers, and codec contained in a single piece of hardware. Typically used in small to medium spaces where beamforming microphone arrays located in the system are sufficient, in lieu of table or ceiling microphones in closer proximity to the in room participants. Quality of service is comparable to standard videoconferencing systems, varying from moderate to high. Some manufacturers' huddle room systems do not include the codec within the soundbar shaped unit, rather only camera, microphone, and speakers. These systems are usually still classified as huddle room systems, but, like webcams, rely on a USB connection to an external device, usually a PC, to process the video codec responsibilities. * Videoconferencing systems‚Äîmidrange cost, usually utilizing multipoint control units or other bridging services to allow multiple parties on videoconference calls. Quality of service can vary from moderate to high. * Telepresence systems‚Äîhighest capabilities and highest cost. Full high-end systems can involve specially built teleconference rooms to allow expansive views with very high levels of audio and video fidelity, to permit an 'immersive' videoconference. When the proper type and capacity transmission lines are provided between facilities, the quality of service reaches state- of-the-art levels.  Security concerns  Computer security experts have shown that poorly configured or inadequately supervised videoconferencing system can permit an easy \\"virtual\\" entry by computer hackers and criminals into company premises and corporate boardrooms, via their own videoconferencing systems.Perlroth, Nicole. Cameras May Open Up the Board Room to Hackers , The New York Times online, January 22, 2012. A version of this article appeared in print on January 23, 2012, on page B1 of the New York edition with the headline: \\"Conferences Via the Net Called Risky\\".  Adoption  For over a century, futurists have envisioned a future where telephone conversations will take place as actual face-to-face encounters with video as well as audio. Sometimes it is simply not possible or practical to have face- to-face meetings with two or more people. Sometimes a telephone conversation or conference call is adequate. Other times, e-mail exchanges are adequate. However, videoconferencing adds another possible alternative, and can be considered when: * A live conversation is needed * Non-verbal (visual) information is an important component of the conversation * The parties of the conversation can't physically come to the same location * The expense or time of travel is a consideration Bill Gates said in 2001 that he used video conferencing \\"three or four times a year\\", because digital scheduling was difficult and \\"if the overhead is super high, then you might as well just have a face-to-face meeting\\". Some observers argue that three outstanding issues have prevented videoconferencing from becoming a widely adopted form of communication, despite the ubiquity of videoconferencing-capable systems.Van Meggelen, Jim. The Problem With Video Conferencing , 2005. * Eye contact: Eye contact plays a large role in conversational turn-taking, perceived attention and intent, and other aspects of group communication.Vertegaal, \\"Explaining Effects of Eye Gaze on Mediated Group Conversations: Amount or Synchronization?\\" ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, 2002. While traditional telephone conversations give no eye contact cues, many videoconferencing systems are arguably worse in that they provide an incorrect impression that the remote interlocutor is avoiding eye contact. Some telepresence systems have cameras located in the screens that reduce the amount of parallax observed by the users. This issue is also being addressed through research that generates a synthetic image with eye contact using stereo reconstruction.Computer vision approaches to achieving eye contact appeared in the 1990s, such as Teleconferencing Eye Contact Using a Virtual Camera, ACM CHI 1993. More recently gaze correction systems using only a single camera have been shown, such as. Microsoft's GazeMaster system. Telcordia Technologies, formerly Bell Communications Research, owns a patent for eye-to-eye videoconferencing using rear projection screens with the video camera behind it, evolved from a 1960s U.S. military system that provided videoconferencing services between the White House and various other government and military facilities. This technique eliminates the need for special cameras or image processing.Google Patent * Appearance consciousness: A second psychological problem with videoconferencing is being on camera, with the video stream possibly even being recorded. The burden of presenting an acceptable on-screen appearance is not present in audio-only communication. Early studies by Alphonse Chapanis found that the addition of video actually impaired communication, possibly because of the consciousness of being on camera. * Signal latency: The information transport of digital signals in many steps need time. In a telecommunicated conversation, an increased latency (time lag) larger than about 150‚Äì300 ms becomes noticeable and is soon observed as unnatural and distracting. Therefore, next to a stable large bandwidth, a small total round-trip time is another major technical requirement for the communication channel for interactive videoconferencing.Percy, Alan. Understanding Latency * Bandwidth and quality of service: In some countries, it is difficult or expensive to get a high quality connection that is fast enough for good-quality video conferencing. Technologies such as ADSL are usually provided as two separate lines (for uplink/downlink) because each has limited upload speeds and cannot upload and download simultaneously at full speed. As Internet speeds increase higher quality and high definition video conferencing will become more readily available. * Complexity of systems: Most users are not technical and want a simple interface. In hardware systems, an unplugged cord or a dead battery in remote control is seen as a failure, contributing to a perceived unreliability. Successful systems are backed by support teams who can pro- actively support and provide fast assistance when required. * Perceived lack of interoperability: not all systems can readily interconnect, for example, ISDN and IP systems require a gateway. Popular software solutions cannot easily connect to hardware systems. Some systems use different standards, features, and qualities which can require additional configuration when connecting to dissimilar systems. Free software systems circumvent this limitation by making it relatively easy for a single user to communicate over multiple incompatible platforms. * Expense of commercial systems: well- designed telepresence systems require specially designed rooms which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to fit out their rooms with codecs, integration equipment (such as Multipoint Control Units), high fidelity sound systems, and furniture. Monthly charges may also be required for bridging services and high capacity broadband service. These are some of the reasons many systems are often used for internal corporate use only, as they are less likely to result in lost sales. One alternative to companies lacking dedicated facilities is the rental of videoconferencing-equipped meeting rooms in cities around the world. Clients can book rooms and turn up for the meeting, with all technical aspects being prearranged and support being readily available if needed. The issue of eye-contact may be solved with advancing technology, including smartphones which have the screen and camera in essentially the same place. The ubiquity of smartphones, tablet computers, and computers with built-in audio and webcams in developed countries obviates the need to buy expensive hardware.  Technology =Components and types= Dual display: An older Polycom VSX 7000 system and camera used for videoconferencing, with two displays for simultaneous broadcast from separate locations Components of a LifeSize Communications Room 220 high-definition multipoint system A video conference meeting facilitated by Google Hangouts The core technology used in a videotelephony system is digital compression of audio and video streams in real time. The hardware or software that performs compression is called a codec (coder/decoder). Compression rates of up to 1:500 can be achieved. The resulting digital stream of 1s and 0s is subdivided into labeled packets, which are then transmitted through a digital network of some kind (usually ISDN or IP). The other components required for a videoconferencing system include: * Video input: (PTZ / 360¬∞ / Fisheye) video camera, or webcam * Video output: computer monitor, television, or projector * Audio input: microphones, CD/DVD player, cassette player, or any other source of PreAmp audio outlet. * Audio output: usually loudspeakers associated with the display device or telephone * Data transfer: analog or digital telephone network, LAN, or Internet * Computer: a data processing unit that ties together the other components, does the compressing and decompressing, and initiates and maintains the data linkage via the network. There are basically two kinds of videoconferencing and videophone systems: # Dedicated systems have all required components packaged into a single piece of equipment, usually a console with a high quality remote controlled video camera. These cameras can be controlled at a distance to pan left and right, tilt up and down, and zoom. They became known as PTZ cameras. The console contains all electrical interfaces, the control computer, and the software or hardware-based codec. Omnidirectional microphones are connected to the console, as well as a TV monitor with loudspeakers and/or a video projector. There are several types of dedicated videoconferencing devices: ## Large group videoconferencing are built-in, large, expensive devices used for large rooms such as conference rooms and auditoriums. ## Small group videoconferencing are either non- portable or portable, smaller, less expensive devices used for small meeting rooms. ## Individual videoconferencing are usually portable devices, meant for single users, and have fixed cameras, microphones, and loudspeakers integrated into the console. # Desktop systems are add-ons (hardware boards or software codec) to normal PCs and laptops, transforming them into videoconferencing devices. A range of different cameras and microphones can be used with the codec, which contains the necessary codec and transmission interfaces. Most of the desktops systems work with the H.323 standard. # WebRTC Platforms are video conferencing solutions that are not resident by using a software application but is available through the standard web browser. Solutions such as Adobe Connect and Cisco WebEX can be accessed by going to a URL sent by the meeting organizer and various degrees of security can be attached to the virtual \\"room\\". Often the user will be required to download a piece of software, called an \\"Add In\\" to enable the browser to access the local camera, microphone and establish a connection to the meeting. WebRTC technology doesn't require any software or Add On installation, instead a WebRTC compliant internet browser itself acts as a client to facilitate 1-to-1 and 1-to-many videoconferencing calls. Several enhanced flavours of WebRTC technology are being provided by Third Party vendors. = Videoconferencing modes = Videoconferencing systems use two methods to determine which video feed or feeds to display. Continuous Presence simply displays all participants at the same time, usually with the exception that the viewer either does not see their own feed, or sees their own feed in miniature. Voice-Activated Switch selectively chooses a feed to display at each endpoint, with the goal of showing the person who is currently speaking. This is done by choosing the feed (other than the viewer) which has the loudest audio input (perhaps with some filtering to avoid switching for very short-lived volume spikes). Often if no remote parties are currently speaking, the feed with the last speaker remains on the screen. = Echo cancellation = Acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) is a processing algorithm that uses the knowledge of audio output to monitor audio input and filter from it noises that echo back after some time delay. If unattended, these echoes can be re-amplified several times, leading to problems including: * The remote party hearing their own voice coming back at them (usually significantly delayed) # Strong reverberation, which makes the voice channel useless # Howling created by feedback Echo cancellation is a processor-intensive task that usually works over a narrow range of sound delays. = Bandwidth requirements = Deutsche Telekom T-View 100 ISDN-type videophone meant for home offices and small businesses, with a lens cover which can be rotated upward for privacy Videophones have historically employed a variety of transmission and reception bandwidths, which can be understood as data transmission speeds. The lower the transmission/reception bandwidth, the lower the data transfer rate, resulting in a progressively limited and poorer image quality (i.e. lower resolution and/or frame rate). Data transfer rates and live video image quality are related, but are also subject to other factors such as data compression techniques. Some early videophones employed very low data transmission rates with a resulting poor video quality. Broadband bandwidth is often called \\"high-speed\\", because it usually has a high rate of data transmission. In general, any connection of 256 kbit/s (0.256 Mbit/s) or greater is more concisely considered broadband Internet. The International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) recommendation I.113 has defined broadband as a transmission capacity at 1.5 to 2Mbit/s. The Federal Communications Commission (United States) definition of broadband is 25 Mbit/s. Currently, adequate video for some purposes becomes possible at data rates lower than the ITU-T broadband definition, with rates of 768 kbit/s and 384 kbit/s used for some video conferencing applications, and rates as low as 100 kbit/s used for videophones using H.264/MPEG-4 AVC compression protocols. The newer MPEG-4 video and audio compression format can deliver high-quality video at 2Mbit/s, which is at the low end of cable modem and ADSL broadband performance. = Standards = The Tandberg E20 is an example of a SIP-only device. Such devices need to route calls through a Video Communication Server to be able to reach H.323 systems, a process known as \\"interworking\\" (2009). The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) has three umbrellas of standards for videoconferencing: * ITU H.320 is known as the standard for public switched telephone networks (PSTN) or videoconferencing over integrated services digital networks. While still prevalent in Europe, ISDN was never widely adopted in the United States and Canada. * ITU H.264 Scalable Video Coding (SVC) is a compression standard that enables videoconferencing systems to achieve highly error resilient Internet Protocol (IP) video transmissions over the public Internet without quality-of- service enhanced lines.SVC vs. H.264/AVC Error Resilience This standard has enabled wide scale deployment of high definition desktop videoconferencing and made possible new architectures,SVC White Papers which reduces latency between the transmitting sources and receivers, resulting in more fluid communication without pauses. In addition, an attractive factor for IP videoconferencing is that it is easier to set up for use along with web conferencing and data collaboration. These combined technologies enable users to have a richer multimedia environment for live meetings, collaboration and presentations. * ITU V.80: videoconferencing is generally compatibilized with H.324 standard point-to-point videotelephony over regular (POTS) phone lines. The Unified Communications Interoperability Forum (UCIF), a non-profit alliance between communications vendors, launched in May 2010. The organization's vision is to maximize the interoperability of UC based on existing standards. Founding members of UCIF include HP, Microsoft, Polycom, Logitech/LifeSize Communications, and Juniper Networks.Unified Communications Interoperability ForumCollaboration Vendors Join for Interoperability = Call setup = Videoconferencing in the late 20th century was limited to the H.323 protocol (notably Cisco's SCCP implementation was an exception), but newer videophones often use SIP, which is often easier to set up in home networking environments. RFC 4168, The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) as a Transport for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), IETF, The Internet Society (2005) It is a text-based protocol, incorporating many elements of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). H.323 is still used, but more commonly for business videoconferencing, while SIP is more commonly used in personal consumer videophones. A number of call-setup methods based on instant messaging protocols such as Skype also now provide video. Another protocol used by videophones is H.324, which mixes call setup and video compression. Videophones that work on regular phone lines typically use H.324, but the bandwidth is limited by the modem to around 33 kbit/s, limiting the video quality and frame rate. A slightly modified version of H.324 called 3G-324M defined by 3GPP is also used by some cellphones that allow video calls, typically for use only in UMTS networks. IMTC.

There is also H.320 standard, which specified technical requirements for narrow-band visual telephone systems and terminal equipment, typically for videoconferencing and videophone services. It applied mostly to dedicated circuit-based switched network (point-to-point) connections of moderate or high bandwidth, such as through the medium-bandwidth ISDN digital phone protocol or a fractionated high bandwidth T1 lines. Modern products based on H.320 standard usually support also H.323 standard. Videoconferencing on the High End: H.320 Retrieved on 2009-06-18. The IAX2 protocol also supports videophone calls natively, using the protocol's own capabilities to transport alternate media streams. A few hobbyists obtained the Nortel 1535 Color SIP Videophone cheaply in 2010 as surplus after Nortel's bankruptcy and deployed the sets on the Asterisk (PBX) platform. While additional software is required to patch together multiple video feeds for conference calls or convert between dissimilar video standards, SIP calls between two identical handsets within the same PBX were relatively straightforward. = Conferencing layers = The components within a videoconferencing system can be divided up into several different layers: User Interface, Conference Control, Control or Signaling Plane, and Media Plane. Videoconferencing User Interfaces (VUI) can be either graphical or voice-responsive. Many in the industry have encountered both types of interface, and normally a graphical interface is encountered on a computer. User interfaces for conferencing have a number of different uses; they can be used for scheduling, setup, and making a videocall. Through the user interface the administrator is able to control the other three layers of the system. Conference Control performs resource allocation, management, and routing. This layer along with the User Interface creates meetings (scheduled or unscheduled) or adds and removes participants from a conference. Control (Signaling) Plane contains the stacks that signal different endpoints to create a call and/or a conference. Signals can be, but aren't limited to, H.323 and Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Protocols. These signals control incoming and outgoing connections as well as session parameters. The Media Plane controls the audio and video mixing and streaming. This layer manages Real-Time Transport Protocols, User Datagram Packets (UDP) and Real-Time Transport Control Protocol (RTCP). The RTP and UDP normally carry information such the payload type which is the type of codec, frame rate, video size, and many others. RTCP on the other hand acts as a quality control Protocol for detecting errors during streaming. = Multipoint control = Simultaneous videoconferencing among three or more remote points is possible in a hardware- based system by means of a Multipoint Control Unit (MCU). This is a bridge that interconnects calls from several sources (in a similar way to the audio conference call). All parties call the MCU, or the MCU can also call the parties which are going to participate, in sequence. There are MCU bridges for IP and ISDN-based videoconferencing. There are MCUs which are pure software, and others which are a combination of hardware and software. An MCU is characterised according to the number of simultaneous calls it can handle, its ability to conduct transposing of data rates and protocols, and features such as Continuous Presence, in which multiple parties can be seen on-screen at once. MCUs can be stand-alone hardware devices, or they can be embedded into dedicated videoconferencing units. The MCU consists of two logical components: # A single multipoint controller (MC), and # Multipoint Processors (MP), sometimes referred to as the mixer. The MC controls the conferencing while it is active on the signaling plane, which is simply where the system manages conferencing creation, endpoint signaling and in-conferencing controls. This component negotiates parameters with every endpoint in the network and controls conferencing resources. While the MC controls resources and signaling negotiations, the MP operates on the media plane and receives media from each endpoint. The MP generates output streams from each endpoint and redirects the information to other endpoints in the conference. Some systems are capable of multipoint conferencing with no MCU, stand-alone, embedded or otherwise. These use a standards-based H.323 technique known as \\"decentralized multipoint\\", where each station in a multipoint call exchanges video and audio directly with the other stations with no central \\"manager\\" or other bottleneck. The advantages of this technique are that the video and audio will generally be of higher quality because they don't have to be relayed through a central point. Also, users can make ad hoc multipoint calls without any concern for the availability or control of an MCU. This added convenience and quality comes at the expense of some increased network bandwidth, because every station must transmit to every other station directly. = Cloud storage = Cloud-based video conferencing can be used without the hardware generally required by other video conferencing systems, and can be designed for use by SMEs, or larger international or multinational corporations like Facebook. Cloud-based systems can handle either 2D or 3D video broadcasting. Cloud-based systems can also implement mobile calls, VOIP, and other forms of video calling. They can also come with a video recording function to archive past meetings.  Impact  A mobile video call between Sweden and Singapore made on a Sony Ericsson K800 (2007) High speed Internet connectivity has become more widely available at a reasonable cost and the cost of video capture and display technology has decreased. Consequently, personal videoconferencing systems based on a webcam, personal computer system, software compression, and broadband Internet connectivity have become progressively more affordable to the general public. Also, the hardware used for this technology has continued to improve in quality, and prices have dropped dramatically. The availability of freeware (often as part of chat programs) has made software based videoconferencing accessible to many. The widest deployment of video telephony now occurs in mobile phones. Nearly all mobile phones supporting UMTS networks can work as videophones using their internal cameras and are able to make video calls wirelessly to other UMTS users in the same country or internationally. As of the second quarter of 2007, there are over 131 million UMTS users (and hence potential videophone users), on 134 networks in 59 countries. Mobile phones can also use broadband wireless Internet, whether through the cell phone network or over a local Wi-Fi connection, along with software-based videophone apps to make calls to any video-capable Internet user, whether mobile or fixed. Deaf, hard-of-hearing, and mute individuals have a particular role in the development of affordable high-quality videotelephony as a means of communicating with each other in sign language. Unlike Video Relay Service, which is intended to support communication between a caller using sign language and another party using spoken language, videoconferencing can be used directly between two deaf signers. Videophones are increasingly used in the provision of telemedicine to the elderly, disabled, and to those in remote locations, where the ease and convenience of quickly obtaining diagnostic and consultative medical services are readily apparent.Videophone Scheme Could Provide 'Virtual Care' for Elderly Residents , Aberdeen Press & Journal (UK), published in Europe Intelligence Wire, 13 November 2006, retrieved 2009-04-14; In one single instance quoted in 2006: \\"A nurse-led clinic at Letham has received positive feedback on a trial of a video-link which allowed 60 pensioners to be assessed by medics without travelling to a doctor's office or medical clinic.\\" A further improvement in telemedical services has been the development of new technology incorporated into special videophones to permit remote diagnostic services, such as blood sugar level, blood pressure, and vital signs monitoring. Such units are capable of relaying both regular audio- video plus medical data over either standard (POTS) telephone or newer broadband lines.\\"Motion Media Unveils Two New Healthcare Videophones‚ÄîCareStation 156s and CareStation 126s\\", Business Wire, May 3, 2004. A Tandberg T3 high-resolution telepresence room in use (2008) Videotelephony has also been deployed in corporate teleconferencing, also available through the use of public access videoconferencing rooms. A higher level of videoconferencing that employs advanced telecommunication technologies and high-resolution displays is called telepresence. Today the principles, if not the precise mechanisms, of a videophone are employed by many users worldwide in the form of webcam videocalls using personal computers, with inexpensive webcams, microphones, and free videocalling Web client programs. Thus an activity that was disappointing as a separate service has found a niche as a minor feature in software products intended for other purposes. According to Juniper Research, smartphone videophone users will reach 29 million by 2015 globally.Smartphone Video Call Users to reach 29 million by 2015 Globally, finds Juniper Research A study conducted by Pew Research in 2010, revealed that 7% of Americans have made a mobile video call. = Government and law = In the United States, videoconferencing has allowed testimony to be used for an individual who is unable or prefers not to attend the physical legal settings or would be subjected to severe psychological stress in doing so, however, there is a controversy on the use of testimony by foreign or unavailable witnesses via video transmission, regarding the violation of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.Tokson, Matthew J. Virtual Confrontation: Is Videoconference Testimony by an Unavailable Witness Constitutional?, University of Chicago Law Review, 2007, Vol. 74, No. 4. In a military investigation in North Carolina, Afghan witnesses have testified via videoconferencing. In Hall County, Georgia, videoconferencing systems are used for initial court appearances. The systems link jails with court rooms, reducing the expenses and security risks of transporting prisoners to the courtroom.Case Study: Hall County , Lifesize.com website. The U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA), which oversees the world's largest administrative judicial system under its Office of Disability Adjudication and Review (ODAR),U.S. Social Security Administration. New National Hearing Centre has made extensive use of videoconferencing to conduct hearings at remote locations.ODAE Pubs: 70-067 In Fiscal Year (FY) 2009, the U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) conducted 86,320 videoconferenced hearings, a 55% increase over FY 2008.SSA Overview Performance In August 2010, the SSA opened its fifth and largest videoconferencing-only National Hearing Center (NHC), in St. Louis, Missouri. This continues the SSA's effort to use video hearings as a means to clear its substantial hearing backlog. Since 2007, the SSA has also established NHCs in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Baltimore, Maryland, Falls Church, Virginia, and Chicago. = Education = Indonesian and U.S. students participate in an educational videoconference (2010) Videoconferencing provides students with the opportunity to learn by participating in two-way communication forums. Furthermore, teachers and lecturers worldwide can be brought to remote or otherwise isolated educational facilities. Students from diverse communities and backgrounds can come together to learn about one another through practices known as telecollaboration(in foreign language education) and virtual exchange, although language barriers will continue to be present. Such students are able to explore, communicate, analyze, and share information and ideas with one another. Through videoconferencing, students can visit other parts of the world to speak with their peers, as well as visit museums and other cultural and educational facilities. Such virtual field trips can provide enriched learning opportunities to students, especially those in geographically isolated locations, and to the economically disadvantaged. Small schools can use these technologies to pool resources and provide courses, such as in foreign languages, which could not otherwise be offered. A few examples of benefits that videoconferencing can provide in campus environments include: * faculty members keeping in touch with classes while attending conferences; * faculty members attending conferences 'virtually' * guest lecturers brought in classes from other institutions;LifeSize Case Study * researchers collaborating with colleagues at other institutions on a regular basis without loss of time due to travel; * schools with multiple campuses collaborating and sharing professors;LifeSize Case Study * schools from two separate nations engaging in cross-cultural exchanges;AVer Case Study * faculty members participating in thesis defenses at other institutions; * administrators on tight schedules collaborating on budget preparation from different parts of campus; * faculty committee auditioning scholarship candidates; * researchers answering questions about grant proposals from agencies or review committees; * student interviews with employers in other cities, and * teleseminars. = Medicine and health = Videoconferencing is a highly useful technology for real time telemedicine and telenursing applications, such as diagnosis, consulting, transmission of medical images, etc. With videoconferencing, patients may contact nurses and physicians in emergency or routine situations; physicians and other paramedical professionals can discuss cases across large distances. Rural areas can use this technology for diagnostic purposes, thus saving lives and making more efficient use of health care money. For example, a rural medical center in Ohio used videoconferencing to successfully cut the number of transfers of sick infants to a hospital away. This had previously cost nearly $10,000 per transfer.Adena Health System Uses LifeSize High Definition Video to Bring Remote Specialists to Infant Patients (media release), LifeSize.com website, December 8, 2008. Special peripherals such as microscopes fitted with digital cameras, videoendoscopes, medical ultrasound imaging devices, otoscopes, etc., can be used in conjunction with videoconferencing equipment to transmit data about a patient. Recent developments in mobile collaboration on hand-held mobile devices have also extended video-conferencing capabilities to locations previously unreachable, such as a remote community, long-term care facility, or a patient's home.Van't Haaff, Corey. Virtually On-sight , Just for Canadian Doctors, March‚ÄìApril 2009, p. 22. = Business = Videoconferencing can enable individuals in distant locations to participate in meetings on short notice, with time and money savings. Technology such as VoIP can be used in conjunction with desktop videoconferencing to enable low-cost face-to-face business meetings without leaving the desk, especially for businesses with widespread offices. The technology is also used for telecommuting, in which employees work from home. One research report based on a sampling of 1,800 corporate employees showed that, as of June 2010, 54% of the respondents with access to video conferencing used it \\"all of the time\\" or \\"frequently\\".By Alison Diane, InformationWeek. \\"Executives Demand Communications Arsenal .\\" September 30, 2010. Retrieved October 5, 2010.How We Work: Communication Trends of Business Professionals , Plantronics Inc., 2010. Retrieved October 13, 2010. Intel Corporation have used videoconferencing to reduce both costs and environmental impacts of its business operations.E. Curry, B. Guyon, C. Sheridan, and B. Donnellan, \\"Developing a Sustainable IT Capability: Lessons From Intel's Journey\\", MIS Quarterly Executive, vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 61‚Äì74, 2012. Videoconferencing is also currently being introduced on online networking websites, in order to help businesses form profitable relationships quickly and efficiently without leaving their place of work. This has been leveraged by banks to connect busy banking professionals with customers in various locations using video banking technology. Videoconferencing on hand- held mobile devices (mobile collaboration technology) is being used in industries such as manufacturing, energy, healthcare, insurance, government, and public safety. Live, visual interaction removes traditional restrictions of distance and time, often in locations previously unreachable, such as a manufacturing plant floor thousands of miles away., Mobile video system visually connects global plant floor engineers, Control Engineering, May 28, 2009 In the increasingly globalized film industry, videoconferencing has become useful as a method by which creative talent in many different locations can collaborate closely on the complex details of film production. For example, for the 2013 award-winning animated film Frozen, Burbank-based Walt Disney Animation Studios hired the New York City-based husband-and-wife songwriting team of Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez to write the songs, which required two-hour-long transcontinental videoconferences nearly every weekday for about 14 months. With the development of lower cost endpoints, cloud based infrastructure and technology trends such as WebRTC, Video Conferencing is moving from just a business-to-business offering, to a business-to-business and business-to-consumer offering. Although videoconferencing has frequently proven its value, research has shown that some non-managerial employees prefer not to use it due to several factors, including anxiety.Wolfe, Mark. \\"Broadband videoconferencing as knowledge management tool\\", Journal of Knowledge Management 11, no.2 (2007) Some such anxieties can be avoided if managers use the technology as part of the normal course of business. Remote workers can also adopt certain behaviors and best practices to stay connected with their co-workers and company. Freeman, Michael, \\"How to stay connected while working remotely\\" Researchers also find that attendees of business and medical videoconferences must work harder to interpret information delivered during a conference than they would if they attended face-to-face. Ferran, Carlos and Watts, Stephanie. \\"Videoconferencing in the field: A heuristic processing model\\", Management Science 54, no.9 (2008) They recommend that those coordinating videoconferences make adjustments to their conferencing procedures and equipment. = Press = The concept of press videoconferencing was developed in October 2007 by the PanAfrican Press Association (APPA), a Paris France-based non-governmental organization, to allow African journalists to participate in international press conferences on developmental and good governance issues. Press videoconferencing permits international press conferences via videoconferencing over the Internet. Journalists can participate on an international press conference from any location, without leaving their offices or countries. They need only be seated by a computer connected to the Internet in order to ask their questions. In 2004, the International Monetary Fund introduced the Online Media Briefing Center, a password-protected site available only to professional journalists. The site enables the IMF to present press briefings globally and facilitates direct questions to briefers from the press. The site has been copied by other international organizations since its inception. More than 4,000 journalists worldwide are currently registered with the IMF. = Sign language = Video Interpreter sign used at VRS/VRI service locations One of the first demonstrations of the ability for telecommunications to help sign language users communicate with each other occurred when AT&T;'s videophone (trademarked as the \\"Picturephone\\") was introduced to the public at the 1964 New York World's Fair‚Äîtwo deaf users were able to communicate freely with each other between the fair and another city. Various universities and other organizations, including British Telecom's Martlesham facility, have also conducted extensive research on signing via videotelephony. New Scientist. Telephones Come To Terms With Sign Language , New Scientist, 19 August 1989, Vol.123, Iss.No.1678, pp.31. Whybray, M.W. Moving Picture Transmission at Low Bitrates for Sign Language Communication , Martlesham, England: British Telecom Laboratories, 1995. The use of sign language via videotelephony was hampered for many years due to the difficulty of its use over slow analogue copper phone lines, coupled with the high cost of better quality ISDN (data) phone lines. Those factors largely disappeared with the introduction of more efficient and powerful video codecs and the advent of lower cost high-speed ISDN data and IP (Internet) services in the 1990s.  21st-century improvements  Significant improvements in video call quality of service for the deaf occurred in the United States in 2003 when Sorenson Media Inc. (formerly Sorenson Vision Inc.), a video compression software coding company, developed its VP-100 model stand-alone videophone specifically for the deaf community. It was designed to output its video to the user's television in order to lower the cost of acquisition, and to offer remote control and a powerful video compression codec for unequaled video quality and ease of use with video relay services. Favourable reviews quickly led to its popular usage at educational facilities for the deaf, and from there to the greater deaf community. Fitzgerald, Thomas J. For the Deaf, Communication Without the Wait, The New York Times, December 18, 2003. Coupled with similar high-quality videophones introduced by other electronics manufacturers, the availability of high speed Internet, and sponsored video relay services authorized by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission in 2002, VRS services for the deaf underwent rapid growth in that country. A deaf or hard-of-hearing person uses a Video Relay Service at his workplace to communicate with a hearing person in London (2007) Using such video equipment in the present day, the deaf, hard-of-hearing, and speech-impaired can communicate between themselves and with hearing individuals using sign language. The United States and several other countries compensate companies to provide \\"Video Relay Services\\" (VRS). Telecommunication equipment can be used to talk to others via a sign language interpreter, who uses a conventional telephone at the same time to communicate with the deaf person's party. Video equipment is also used to do on-site sign language translation via Video Remote Interpreting (VRI). The relative low cost and widespread availability of 3G mobile phone technology with video calling capabilities have given deaf and speech-impaired users a greater ability to communicate with the same ease as others. Some wireless operators have even started free sign language gateways. Sign language interpretation services via VRS or by VRI are useful in the present day where one of the parties is deaf, hard-of- hearing, or speech-impaired (mute). In such cases the interpretation flow is normally within the same principal language, such as French Sign Language (LSF) to spoken French, Spanish Sign Language (LSE) to spoken Spanish, British Sign Language (BSL) to spoken English, and American Sign Language (ASL) also to spoken English (since BSL and ASL are completely distinct from each other), German Sign Language (DGS) to spoken German, and so on. Multilingual sign language interpreters, who can also translate as well across principal languages (such as a multilingual interpreter interpreting a call from a deaf person using ASL to reserve a hotel room at a hotel in the Dominican Republic whose staff speaks Spanish only, therefore the interpreter has to utilize ASL, spoken Spanish, and spoken English to facilitate the call for the deaf person), are also available, albeit less frequently. Such activities involve considerable mental processing efforts on the part of the translator, since sign languages are distinct natural languages with their own construction, semantics and syntax, different from the aural version of the same principal language. With video interpreting, sign language interpreters work remotely with live video and audio feeds, so that the interpreter can see the deaf or mute party, and converse with the hearing party, and vice versa. Much like telephone interpreting, video interpreting can be used for situations in which no on-site interpreters are available. However, video interpreting cannot be used for situations in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone. VRS and VRI interpretation requires all parties to have the necessary equipment. Some advanced equipment enables interpreters to control the video camera remotely, in order to zoom in and out or to point the camera toward the party that is signing.  Descriptive names and terminology  The name \\"videophone\\" never became as standardized as its earlier counterpart \\"telephone\\", resulting in a variety of names and terms being used worldwide, and even within the same region or country. Videophones are also known as \\"video phones\\", \\"videotelephones\\" (or \\"video telephones\\") and often by an early trademarked name Picturephone, which was the world's first commercial videophone produced in volume. The compound name \\"videophone\\" slowly entered into general use after 1950,Videophone definition , Merriam-Webster Online.

However that distinction has become increasingly blurred with technology improvements such as increased bandwidth and sophisticated software clients that can allow for multiple parties on a call. In general everyday usage the term videoconferencing is now frequently used instead of videocall for point-to-point calls between two units. Both videophone calls and videoconferencing are also now commonly referred to as a video link. Webcams are popular, relatively low cost devices which can provide live video and audio streams via personal computers, and can be used with many software clients for both video calls and videoconferencing. A videoconference system is generally higher cost than a videophone and deploys greater capabilities. A videoconference (also known as a videoteleconference) allows two or more locations to communicate via live, simultaneous two-way video and audio transmissions. This is often accomplished by the use of a multipoint control unit (a centralized distribution and call management system) or by a similar non-centralized multipoint capability embedded in each videoconferencing unit. Again, technology improvements have circumvented traditional definitions by allowing multiple party videoconferencing via web-based applications. Lawson, Stephen.

Other names for videophone that have been used in English are: Viewphone (the British Telecom equivalent to AT&T;'s Picturephone), and visiophone, a common French translation that has also crept into limited English usage, as well as over twenty less common names and expressions. Latin-based translations of videophone in other languages include vid√©ophone (French), Bildtelefon (German), videotelefono (Italian), both vide√≥fono and videotel√©fono (Spanish), both beeldtelefoon and videofoon (Dutch), and videofon√≠a (Catalan). A telepresence robot (also telerobotics) is a robotically controlled and motorized video conferencing display to help give a better sense of remote physical presence for communication and collaboration in an office, home, school, etc. when one cannot be there in person.

Popular culture  2001: A Space Odyssey calls his daughter on Earth In science fiction literature, names commonly associated with videophones include \\"telephonoscope\\", \\"telephote\\", viewphone, vidphone, vidfone, and visiphone. The first example was probably the cartoon \\"Edison's Telephonoscope\\" by George du Maurier in Punch 1878. In many science fiction movies and TV programs that are set in the future, videophones were used as a primary method of communication. One of the first movies where a videophone was used was Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927).French, Lawrence. Director Fritz Lang on the Making of Metropolis, May 15, 2010, retrieved from CinemaFantastique website, April 8, 2012. Other notable examples of videophones in popular culture include an iconic scene from the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey set on Space Station V. The movie was released shortly before AT&T; began its efforts to commercialize its Picturephone Mod II service in several cities and depicts a videocall to Earth using an advanced AT&T; videophone‚Äîwhich it predicts will cost $1.70 for a two-minute call in 2001 (a fraction of the company's real rates on Earth in 1968). Film director Stanley Kubrick strove for scientific accuracy, relying on interviews with scientists and engineers at Bell Labs in the United States. Dr. Larry Rabiner of Bell Labs, discussing videophone research in the documentary 2001: The Making of a Myth, stated that in the mid- to late-1960s videophones \\"...captured the imagination of the public and... of Mr. Kubrick and the people who reported to him\\". In one 2001 movie scene a central character, Dr. Heywood Floyd, calls home to contact his family, a social feature noted in the Making of a Myth. Floyd talks with and views his daughter from a space station in orbit above the Earth, discussing what type of present he should bring home for her. 2001: The Making of a Myth , (TV Documentary) first released on 13 January 2001 (UK), presented and narrated by James Cameron; directed by Paul Joyce under Jamie Doran (video sequence from 0:23:00 to 0:24:20). A portable videophone is also featured prominently in the 2009 science fiction movie Moon, where the story's protagonist, Sam Bell, also calls home as well to communicate with loved ones. Bell, the lone occupant of a mining station on the far side of the Earth's moon, finally succeeds in making his videocall after an extended work period, but becomes traumatized when viewing his daughter. Marshall, Colin. Moon (Duncan Jones, 2009), SBCC Film Reviews, November 20, 2009. Other earlier examples of videophones in popular culture included a videophone that was featured in the Warner Bros. cartoon, Plane Daffy, in which the female spy Hatta Mari used a videophone to communicate with Adolf Hitler (1944), as well as a device with the same functionality has been used by the comic strip character Dick Tracy, who often used his \\"2-way wrist TV\\" to communicate with police headquarters. Garyn G. Roberts, Dick Tracy and American Culture: Morality and Mythology, Text and Context, McFarland, 2003. (1964‚Äì1977). By the early 2010s videotelephony and videophones had become commonplace and unremarkable in various forms of media, in part due to their real and ubiquitous presence in common electronic devices and laptop computers. Additionally, TV programming increasingly utilized videophones to interview subjects of interest and to present live coverage by news correspondents, via the Internet or by satellite links. In the mass market media, the popular U.S. TV talk show hostess Oprah Winfrey incorporated videotelephony into her TV program on a regular basis from May 21, 2009, with an initial episode called Where the Skype Are You?, as part of a marketing agreement with the Internet telecommunication company Skype.

Early life Born at Huntly Hill, near Brechin, Angus, Nichol was the son of a gentleman farmer and was educated at the local grammar school and then studied mathematics and natural philosophy (physics) at King's College, University of Aberdeen. He then changed to study divinity. He was licensed as a preacher and became a highly effective communicator, but the impact of phrenological thinking led him to abandon the Church for education. Nichol held a number of posts in education and journalism and corresponded with many leading thinkers of the times, including John Stuart Mill. He clearly made some impression in economics as James Mill and Nassau Senior nominated him as Jean-Baptiste Say's successor as professor of political economy at the Coll√®ge de France though he was at the time too ill to take the post. Astronomy In 1836 and in competition with Thomas Carlyle, Nichol was appointed Regius Professor of Astronomy at the University of Glasgow. He became an enthusiastic and effective lecturer and made a profound impression on William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin with his introduction of the \\"Continental\\" approach to mathematical physics of Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier. He lived at the Glasgow Observatory.Glasgow Post Office Directory 1858 Nichol turned to popular lecturing and authored a number of popular and successful books about astronomy, especially championing the nebular hypothesis.Schaffer, S. (1989) \\"The nebular hypothesis and the science of progress\\", in History, Humanity and Evolution, ed. J. R. Moore, pp. 131‚Äì54 In 1841 George Eliot wrote: William John Macquorn Rankine declared Nichol's Dictionary of the Physical Sciences to be: Private life grave of John Pringle Nichol, Grange Cemetery, Edinburgh In 1831 Nichol married Jane Tullis of Cupar in Fife (1813-1851). Their eldest son, John Nichol became a literary critic and writer. Jane died in 1850. Nichol married secondly Elizabeth Pease in 1853, a prominent reformer and member of the Darlington Pease family, much against her family's wishes. His daughter, Agnes Jane Nichol, married the mathematician William Jack FRSE (1834‚Äì1924). Nichol was a member of the Edinburgh Phrenological Society. During the late 1840s, his health declined and, stemming from his physician's prescription, Nichol became addicted to opiates. He recorded an account of his drug-addiction illness and its cure by hydrotherapy at the Ben Rhydding Hydro in his book Memorials from Ben Rhydding (1852). He died at Glenburn House in Rothesay but is buried in Grange Cemetery in south Edinburgh. NotesBibliography *Nichol, J.P.

Early life and career Dan Jacobson was born 7 March 1929, in Johannesburg, South Africa, where his parents' families had come to avoid the persecution of Jews and to escape poverty in their European homelands. His father, Hymann Michael Jacobson, was born in Il≈´kste, Latvia, in 1885. His mother, Liebe (Melamed) Jacobson, was born in Kelme, Lithuania, in 1896. Jacobson had two older brothers, Israel Joshua and Hirsh, and a younger sister, Aviva. His mother's family emigrated to South Africa in 1919, after the death of his grandfather. His grandfather, Heshel Melamed, was a rabbi, and refused to leave Lithuania after traveling to the United States and finding that many Jews were not following their religion. Jacobson later wrote in his memoir \\"Heshel's Kingdom\\" about his travels back to Lithuania to find out more information about his grandfather. When Dan was four, the family moved from Johannesburg to Kimberley, which was then under British control. The city had once been a huge diamond mining center, but the mines had closed and the town was in decline. However, the De Beers Consolidated Mines Company continued to have great influence. He attended a public school and learned English. During his childhood, he became aware of the ways that different people were treated based on their race, religion, economic status, and social status. In his autobiography Time and Again, he refers to the many classes of people in his community: \\"The Africans lived either in rooms in the back yards of their employers' houses or in sprawling, dusty, tatterdemalion 'locations'; the Cape Coloureds (South African name for people of mixed race) lived in their parts of town; the whites in theirs. Interspersed among these groups were smaller communities: Indians and Chinese among the non-whites, Jews and Greeks among the whites. As for the major division among the whites themselves, that between English-speaking and Afrikaans-speaking, or Briton and Boer.‚Ä¶ All these peoples met in the streets, they did business with one another, but just about every aspect of their social life was severely segregated. To sit together in the same room with anyone of a darker skin than their own was a moral impossibility for most whites.\\" He later recalled that many of his Jewish friends and acquaintances sympathized with the blacks in South Africa. He began to observe the ways that the government, churches, and the newspapers justified the ill treatment of blacks. At the age of 11, an event occurred that affected Jacobson for the rest of his life. After helping a boy rescue his book bag from a filthy trash bin, he went to school unaware that he had gotten dirt on the back of his legs. When his teacher mentioned the dirt in front of the class, several of the boys made fun of him and led the class in ignoring him for six to eight weeks. He was stunned at the mob mentality, seeing how a few leaders of the class could control the actions of the entire group. Paul Gready writes in Research in African Literatures: \\"A childhood experience of bullying and ostracism was something from which Jacobson was 'never to wholly recover.\\"' The Jewish community in Kimberley was a strong one. More Lithuanian Jews traveled to South Africa in the early 20th century than to any other country except the United States. Many were hoping to follow in the footsteps of Sammy Marks, a Lithuanian who had made his fortune in the diamond mines. The Jewish community grew even closer together in the 1930s as Nazism rose, and they felt connected to Jews around the world. Jacobson's parents were not particularly religious, but his father insisted that the children attend synagogue and Hebrew lessons, because, as Jacobson later wrote, \\"To have done less, especially as the Nazi madness swept across Europe, would have seemed to him spineless, even treacherous.\\" Jacobson attended, but usually under protest. Jacobson attended Boys' High School in Kimberley and graduated at the age of 16. He went on to the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, where he graduated at the top of his class with a bachelor's degree in English Literature. Following his graduation in 1948, he worked as a laborer in an Israeli kibbutz for about a year. Then he got a job as a teacher at a Jewish school in London. In less than a year, he was asked to leave, according to his autobiography, because he did not know enough about Orthodox Judaism. He returned to Johannesburg in 1951 and worked for the South African Jewish Board of Deputies as a public relations assistant and then as a journalist for Press Digest. In 1952 he returned to Kimberley to work as a correspondence secretary on his father's cattle farm. During this period he became determined to be a writer. His first literary success occurred with a short story entitled \\"The Box,\\" which was published in Commentary. It was followed by other short stories in Harpers Bazaar, The New Yorker, and other magazines. In February 1954, he married Margaret Pye, whom he had met while working in London. His first novel, The Trap, was released in 1955, followed by A Dance in the Sun in 1956. Both books drawn upon his childhood experiences. Together the two books earned him a yearlong creative writing fellowship at Stanford University in California. During his time at Stanford, he completed his third novel, The Price of Diamonds, which was also set in South Africa but was a lighthearted comedy-mystery with a moral message. All three books dealt with prejudice and racism. He returned to England in 1957, determined to seek greater depth in his writing. In 1959, he received the John Llewelyn Rhys Award for fiction for his collection of short stories, A Long Way from London. In 1960, The Evidence of Love was published. It dealt with the racism involved in a romantic relationship between a black man and a white woman who were put in prison for getting married. In 1964, he received the W. Somerset Maugham Award for his first collection of essays, Time of Arrival. One of his short stories, \\"The Zulu and the Zeide,\\" was adapted into a musical and produced on Broadway in 1965. In 1966, he published The Beginners, a longer, in-depth novel following the lives of a Jewish family after their emigration to South Africa. It was a great literary success. Over the next two decades, he continued to write while holding various teaching positions. In 1965‚Äì66, he was visiting professor at Syracuse University in New York. A Dance in the Sun, his second novel, was produced as the play Day of the Lion in Cleveland in 1968. He was a Visiting Fellow at the State University of New York at Buffalo in the summer of 1971. In 1974, he became vice chair of the Literature Panel of the Arts Council of Great Britain. In 1981, he was a Fellow at the Humanities Research Centre at Australian National University. He also took a position at the University of London as a lecturer; from 1979 to 1987 he was a reader in English. In 1988, he became a professor of English, a position he would hold until his retirement in 1994. Jacobson's first five novels all focused on South Africa. His writing focus then shifted to moral and ethical issues involving all of humanity. Although he had no interest in learning the Bible as a child, he developed a strong interest in the Old Testament as an adult. In The Rape of Tamar, he retells the story of the rape of Tamar by her half-brother Amnon, the brother of Absolom. The book was adapted into a play called Yonadeb, after the narrative character in the book, and was produced in London in 1985. In The Story of Stories: The Chosen People and its God, he provided a study of the Bible. His goal was to have a textual analysis as a narrative. The book was criticized by many Jews, probably because he refers to God as \\"an imaginative creation.\\" Themes that continued to reveal themselves in his works included race relations, class consciousness, human nature, universal traits, group mentality, corruption, betrayal, guilt, power, and social morality. In an article that he wrote for Commentary in 2000, entitled \\"My Jewish Childhood,\\" Jacobson said: \\"It is always going to be difficult to get socially and racially diverse people to live harmoniously together within a single polity.\\" In 1985, his autobiography, Time and Again: Autobiographical Essays, was published. Each of the 13 chapters tells of an event in his life that shaped his way of thinking about the human race. The book won the J.R. Ackerly Prize for autobiography. The God-Fearer, published in 1992, is a story of persecution. Jews are in the majority and oppress a group called the \\"Christers.\\" In a Washington Post article, Anne Roiphe observed: \\"By making the majority Jewish, Jacobson makes it clear that power is the source of oppression: not that the power is German or Christian, but that it has the weight of numbers. ‚Ä¶ The horror of the story lies not in gruesome details or heated prose, but in the calm truth of what we call normal behavior when we try to save our skin at any cost.\\" In the middle 1990s, Jacobson turned to nonfiction. In 1994 he published The Electronic Elephant: A South African Journey about his travels back to South Africa to observe the changes in the land and the culture since his childhood. In 1998, Heshel's Kingdom provided a moving story of his travels to Lithuania to learn more about the life of his grandfather. He started with his grandfather's identity document, spectacles, an address book, an old photograph, and the memories of relatives. Sadly, he found no trace of his grandfather, and, indeed, not even the cemetery he was buried in remained. He did find that in 1941, within six weeks' time, the Nazis essentially wiped out the Lithuanian Jewish community, killing 210,000 Jewish people. Works His early novels, including The Trap, his first published novel, focus on South African themes. His later works have been various in kind: they include works of fantasy and fictional treatments of historical episodes, as well as memoirs, critical essays, and travel books. Among the awards and prizes he has received are the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize 1959 (A Long Way from London and Other Stories); Somerset Maugham Award 1964 (Time of Arrival and Other Essays); The Jewish Chronicle Award 1977 (The Confessions of Josef Baisz); the J. R. Ackerley Prize for Autobiography 1986 (Time and Time Again). In 2000 he edited and translated from the Dutch Een mond vol Glas by Henk van Woerden, an imaginative re-creation of the circumstances leading to the assassination of the South African president Dr Hendrik Verwoerd, in the country's House of Assembly. His 2005 novel All For Love was long listed for the Man Booker Prize. Honours Dan Jacobson received an Honorary D. Litt. from the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, and on retirement from his position at University College London was elected a Fellow of the college. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2007. Papers Collections of his papers can be found at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, Austin, Texas; Oxford University, England; and, in South Africa, at Witwatersrand University Library, Johannesburg, the National English Literary Museum, Grahamstown, and the Africana Library, Kimberley.

The orthodox rabbi Heshel Melamed's sudden death in 1919 had provided an opportunity for his widow and nine children to leave Lithuania for South Africa, which, in light of events two decades later, ironically, had been a gift of life. \\"On his travels in Lithuania Jacobson finds scarcely any trace of his forebears, only signs everywhere of the annihilation from which Heshel's weak heart had preserved his immediate family when it stopped beating.\\"Sebald, W.G.

NAT traversal techniques are typically required for client-to-client networking applications on the Internet involving hosts connected in private networks, especially in peer-to-peer, Direct Client-to-Client (DCC) and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) deployments. UDP hole punching establishes connectivity between two hosts communicating across one or more network address translators. Typically, third-party hosts on the public transit network are used to establish UDP port states that may be used for direct communications between the communicating hosts. Once port state has been successfully established and the hosts are communicating, port state may be maintained either by normal communications traffic, or in the prolonged absence thereof, by keep-alive packets, usually consisting of empty UDP packets or packets with minimal non-intrusive content. Overview UDP hole punching is a method for establishing bidirectional UDP connections between Internet hosts in private networks using network address translators. The technique is not applicable in all scenarios or with all types of NATs, as NAT operating characteristics are not standardized. Hosts with network connectivity inside a private network connected via a NAT to the Internet typically use the Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) method or Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) to determine the public address of the NAT that its communications peers require. In this process another host on the public network is used to establish port mapping and other UDP port state that is assumed to be valid for direct communication between the application hosts. Since UDP state usually expires after short periods of time in the range of tens of seconds to a few minutes, and the UDP port is closed in the process, UDP hole punching employs the transmission of periodic keep-alive packets, each renewing the life-time counters in the UDP state machine of the NAT. UDP hole punching will not work with symmetric NAT devices (also known as bi-directional NAT) which tend to be found in large corporate networks. In symmetric NAT, the NAT's mapping associated with the connection to the well-known STUN server is restricted to receiving data from the well- known server, and therefore the NAT mapping the well-known server sees is not useful information to the endpoint. In a somewhat more elaborate approach both hosts will start sending to each other, using multiple attempts. On a Restricted Cone NAT, the first packet from the other host will be blocked. After that the NAT device has a record of having sent a packet to the other machine, and will let any packets coming from this IP address and port number through. This technique is widely used in peer-to-peer software and Voice over Internet Protocol telephony. It can also be used to assist the establishment of virtual private networks operating over UDP. The same technique is sometimes extended to Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connections, though with less success because TCP connection streams are controlled by the host OS, not the application, and sequence numbers are selected randomly; thus any NAT device that performs sequence-number checking will not consider the packets to be associated with an existing connection and drop them. Flow Let A and B be the two hosts, each in its own private network; NA and NB are the two NAT devices with globally reachable IP addresses EIPA and EIPB respectively; S is a public server with a well-known, globally reachable IP address. # A and B each begin a UDP conversation with S; the NAT devices NA and NB create UDP translation states and assign temporary external port numbers EPA and EPB # S examines the UDP packets to get the source port used by NA and NB (the external NAT ports EPA and EPB) # S passes EIPA:EPA to B and EIPB:EPB to A # A sends a packet to EIPB:EPB. # NA examines A's packet and creates the following tuple in its translation table: (Source-IP-A, EPA, EIPB, EPB) # B sends a packet to EIPA:EPA # NB examines B's packet and creates the following tuple in its translation table: (Source-IP-B, EPB, EIPA, EPA) # Depending on the state of NA's translation table when B's first packet arrives (i.e. whether the tuple (Source-IP-A, EPA, EIPB, EPB) has been created by the time of arrival of B's first packet), B's first packet is dropped (no entry in translation table) or passed (entry in translation table has been made). # Depending on the state of NB's translation table when A's first packet arrives (i.e. whether the tuple (Source-IP-B, EPB, EIPA, EPA) has been created by the time of arrival of A's first packet), A's first packet is dropped (no entry in translation table) or passed (entry in translation table has been made). # At worst, the second packet from A reaches B; at worst the second packet from B reaches A. Holes have been \\"punched\\" in the NAT and both hosts can directly communicate. * If both hosts have Restricted cone NATs or Symmetric NATs, the external NAT ports will differ from those used with S. On some routers, the external ports are picked sequentially making it possible to establish a conversation through guessing nearby ports.

A right-handed opening batsman, he originally hails from Australia and captained their Under-19 side for two Under-19 Tests in 1989 and 1990. He played three Test matches for England but disappointed, with a highest score of 28 runs in six innings. Gallian was a county professional for fifteen years, previously playing for Lancashire and Nottinghamshire. He signed a two- year deal to play for Essex until 2009, and scored 171 on his Championship debut for the county. In September 2005, Gallian became the first player to have twice been dismissed for 199 in first-class cricket when he was run out against Kent. His previous dismissal for that score had been in April of the same season against Sussex, and on that occasion he was also run out. Early in his career he, along with Graham Thorpe, was heralded as a brilliant prospect for England, but as his record suggests, while Gallian may have had the talent to play Test cricket, he apparently lacked the temperament. Early career Gallian was born at Manly, New South Wales and captained the Australian under-19 side against its English counterpart in 1989.

He has also authored/illustrated the Pip and Posy series of books for children. Early life Scheffler was born in Hamburg, West Germany, in 1957. He began studying the History of Art at the University of Hamburg but dropped out, deciding instead to do alternative National Service, caring for the mentally ill. He moved to England in 1982, at the age of 25, to study Visual Communications at the Bath Academy of Art in Corsham, Wiltshire. The course also included an exchange to Cooper Union in New York. It was during these years (1982‚Äì1984) that Scheffler decided to become an illustrator.  Career  Scheffler worked in advertising and publishing after graduating in 1985. During this time he lived at Streatham Hill in London and soon began children's illustrating. The first book he illustrated was The Piemakers by Helen Cresswell, in 1988. Since then, he has drawn his distinctive illustrations for authors of children's books from Britain, Germany and the Netherlands, including, in addition to Julia Donaldson, Jon Blake, Paul Shipton, David Henry Wilson, Uwe Timm, Paul van Loon and Toon Tellegen.

Sometimes described as a think tank or \\"party of the mind\\", its name alludes to the Thule Society, in an ominous analogy with the organization that facilitated the rise of the Nazis and provided some of the intellectual cadre for the latter. It describes itself as a \\"research society for Indo-European culture\\".

For example, Prince Shotoku was also known as Prince Umayado and Prince Kamitsumiya. Shinran's original name was Matsuwakamaru; he was also known as Hanen, Shakku, Zenshin, Gutoku Shinran and Kenshin Daeshi.https://www.britannica.com/biography/Shinran-Japanese-Buddhist- philosopher Nichiren's original name was Zennichi and his dharma names were Zenshobo Rencho and Rissho Daishi. Similarly, the tradition of various Dharma names was also used by Zen monks, who also used art to promote Buddhism. The famous monk-painter Hokusai was also known as Shunro, Kako, Sori, Taito, Iitsu, Gakyojin and Manji.https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hokusai Even the famous Samurai Miyamoto Musashi had several names, including the Dharma name Niten Doraku and the birthname Miyamoto Masana. The zen monk Thich Nhat Hanh also has used various Dharma names in the course of his career. If the student doesn't have a relationship with the monastic teacher and the ceremony is a public one with a congregation present, their new name will tend to reflect the lineage/tradition rather than the individual person. When it is given by a monastic who knows the disciple, however, the name is often tailor- made. Dharma names are generally given in the language of the particular sangha where the name is bestowed. People in the Karma Kagyu tradition of Tibetan Buddhism are often given the name Karma. In Burmese Buddhism, Dhamma names (bwe) are in Pali and chosen by the head monk of the monastery in which one is ordained. The traditional Burmese naming system, in which the monastic's day of birth stipulates the first letter of one's name, is used to select the name. In China, ordained monks and nuns automatically revert to using the surname \\"Shi\\" (Èáã) as in Shijiamouni (ÈáãËø¶ÁâüÂ∞º), the Chinese transliteration of Shakyamuni Buddha. Vietnam also follows this tradition for its monks and nuns by changing their surname to \\"Th√≠ch\\" as in Th√≠ch Ca M√¢u Ni, the Sino-Vietnamese name for Shakyamuni. Likewise for the Sino-Mahayana tradition of Buddhism, the dharma name given upon ordination can reflect the lineage passed from the teacher to the student, this can result in being given several dharma names: one for usage publicly, one used especially to reflect the transmitted lineage, and a second dharma name that can also be used. In Japan, other than the standard usage of dharma names for monastics and laity, it is also tradition for the deceased to receive a dharma name (ÊàíÂêç, kaimy≈ç; literally \\"precept name\\") written in kanji from the priest. This name supposedly prevents the return of the deceased if his name is called. The length of the name depends also on either the virtue of the person's lifespan, or more commonly, the size of the donation of the relatives to the temple, which may range from a generally common name to the most elaborate names for 1 million yen or more. The high prices charged by the temples are a controversial issue in Japan, especially since some temples put pressure on families to buy a more expensive name. In the Shaolin Temple, each subsequent generation takes the first part of their given name from a 70-character poem written by Xueting Fuyu. For example, the 32nd character in the poem is \\"Xing\\" (Ë°å), and all Shaolin Temple monks and disciples of that generation names starting with Shi Xing.

NAT traversal techniques are required for many network applications, such as peer-to-peer file sharing and Voice over IP. Network address translation NAT devices allow the use of private IP addresses on private networks behind routers with a single public IP address facing the Internet. The internal network devices communicate with hosts on the external network by changing the source address of outgoing requests to that of the NAT device and relaying replies back to the originating device. This leaves the internal network ill-suited for hosting servers, as the NAT device has no automatic method of determining the internal host for which incoming packets are destined. This is not a problem for general web access and email. However, applications such as peer-to-peer file sharing, VoIP services, and video game consoles require clients to be servers as well. Incoming requests cannot be easily correlated to the proper internal host. Furthermore, many of these types of services carry IP address and port number information in the application data, potentially requiring substitution with deep packet inspection. Network address translation technologies are not standardized. As a result, the methods used for NAT traversal are often proprietary and poorly documented. Many traversal techniques require assistance from servers outside of the masqueraded network. Some methods use the server only when establishing the connection, while others are based on relaying all data through it, which increases the bandwidth requirements and latency, detrimental to real-time voice and video communications. NAT traversal techniques usually bypass enterprise security policies. Enterprise security experts prefer techniques that explicitly cooperate with NAT and firewalls, allowing NAT traversal while still enabling marshalling at the NAT to enforce enterprise security policies. IETF standards based on this security model are Realm-Specific IP (RSIP) and middlebox communications (MIDCOM).  Techniques  The following NAT traversal techniques are available: * Socket Secure (SOCKS) is a technology created in the early 1990s that uses proxy servers to relay traffic between networks or systems. * Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) is a relay protocol designed specifically for NAT traversal. * NAT hole punching is a general technique that exploits how NATs handle some protocols (for example, UDP, TCP, or ICMP) to allow previously blocked packets through the NAT. ** UDP hole punching ** TCP hole punching * Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) is a standardized set of methods and a network protocol for NAT hole punching. It was designed for UDP but was also extended to TCP. * Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) is a complete protocol for using STUN and/or TURN to do NAT traversal while picking the best network route available. It fills in some of the missing pieces and deficiencies that were not mentioned by STUN specification. * UPnP Internet Gateway Device Protocol (IGDP) is supported by many small NAT gateways in home or small office settings. It allows a device on a network to ask the router to open a port. * NAT-PMP is a protocol introduced by Apple as an alternative to IGDP. * PCP is a successor of NAT-PMP. * Application-level gateway (ALG) is a component of a firewall or NAT that allows for configuring NAT traversal filters. It is claimed by numerous people that this technique creates more problems than it solves. =Symmetric NAT= The recent proliferation of symmetric NATs has reduced NAT traversal success rates in many practical situations, such as for mobile and public WiFi connections. Hole punching techniques, such as STUN and ICE, fail in traversing symmetric NATs without the help of a relay server, as is practiced in TURN. Techniques that traverse symmetric NATs by attempting to predict the next port to be opened by each NAT device were discovered in 2003 by Yutaka Takeda at Panasonic Communications Research Laboratory and in 2008 by researchers at Waseda University. Port prediction techniques are only effective with NAT devices that use known deterministic algorithms for port selection. This predictable yet non-static port allocation scheme is uncommon in large scale NATs such as those used in 4G LTE networks and therefore port prediction is largely ineffective on those mobile broadband networks. IPsec IPsec virtual private network clients use NAT traversal in order to have Encapsulating Security Payload packets traverse NAT. IPsec uses several protocols in its operation which must be enabled to traverse firewalls and network address translators: * Internet Key Exchange (IKE) User Datagram Protocol (UDP) port 500 * Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) IP protocol number 50 * Authentication Header (AH) IP protocol number 51 * IPsec NAT traversal UDP port 4500, if and only if NAT traversal is in use Many routers provide explicit features, often called IPsec Passthrough. In Windows XP, NAT traversal is enabled by default, but in Windows XP with Service Pack 2 it has been disabled by default for the case when the VPN server is also behind a NAT device, because of a rare and controversial security issue. IPsec NAT-T patches are also available for Windows 2000, Windows NT and Windows 98. NAT traversal and IPsec may be used to enable opportunistic encryption of traffic between systems. NAT traversal allows systems behind NATs to request and establish secure connections on demand. Hosted NAT traversal Hosted NAT traversal (HNT) is a set of mechanisms, including media relaying and latching, used by intermediaries.

The Black Sun () is a Nazi symbol, a type of sun wheel (German: ) employed in a post‚ÄìNazi Germany context by neo-Nazis and in some strains of Satanism. The symbol's design consists of twelve radial sig runes, similar to the symbols employed by the SS in their logo. It first appeared in Nazi Germany as a design element in a castle at Wewelsburg remodeled and expanded by Heinrich Himmler which he intended to be a center for the SS. Whether the design had a name or held any particular significance among the SS remains unknown. Its association with the occult originates with a 1991 German novel Die Schwarze Sonne von Tashi Lhunpo (\\"The Black Sun of Tashi Lhunpo) by the pseudonymous author Russell McCloud. The book links the Wewelsburg mosaic with the neo-Nazi concept of the \\"Black Sun\\", invented by former SS officer Wilhelm Landig as a substitute for the Nazi swastika. Wewelsburg mosaic The floor of the former SS Generals' Hall (German: ) on the first floor of the North Tower of Wewelsburg Castle showing the dark green mosaic at the center of the hall In 1933, Heinrich Himmler acquired Wewelsburg, a castle near Paderborn, Germany. Himmler intended to make the structure into a center for the SS, and between 1936 and 1942, Himmler ordered the building expanded and rebuilt for ceremonial purposes. Sig runes used as the logo of the SS As a product of Himmler's remodeling, twelve dark-green radially overlaid sig runes, such as those employed in the logo of the SS, appear on the white marble floor of the structure's north tower, the or \\"General's Hall\\". The intended significance of the image remains unknown, but the artist may have found inspiration from decorative Merovingian disks (). According to the historian Nicholas Goodrick- Clarke: Neo-Nazism The Black Sun symbol is widely associated with neo- fascism and neo-Nazism. It is utilized by far-right neo-Nazis and white nationalists. The symbol often appears on extremist flags, t-shirts, posters, websites and in extremist publications associated with such groups.

The film is based on the 1979 novel Puberty Blues, by Gabrielle Carey and Kathy Lette, which is a protofeminist teen novel about two 15-year- old girls from the middle class Sutherland Shire in Sydney. The girls attempt to create a popular social status by ingratiating themselves with the \\"Greenhill gang\\" of surfers, who have a careless attitude toward casual sex, drugs and alcohol over the course of one Sydney summer. Changes from book to film For censorship reasons, in the film their age was increased to 16. Much of the content of the novel appears in the film, with several passages of text recounted by the film's protagonist Debbie (Nell Schofield) in a voice-over narration. The film closely follows the story and character trajectory of the novel. Some of the novel's characters are composites in the film. The tone of the novel is generally darker than that of the film, and in the novel Debbie and her best friend Sue, who join the surfer gang, are shown to be much more willing participants in activities than they are in the film. Some of the darker moments of the book have been removed or softened for the film. The film adds a comedy beach brawl between the surfers and the lifeguards not present in the novel. Lette complained that \\"the film sanitised the plot by omitting central references to miscarriage and abortion. The movie depicts a culture in which gang rape is incidental, mindless violence is amusing and hard drug use is fatal, but it was unable to address the consequences of the brutal sexual economy in which the girls must exist.\\" Much of the obscure surfer slang of the novel was omitted from the film. The novel features some discussion about television series Number 96. One passage of the novel that mentions the title is recounted by the film's protagonist in a voice-over narration, but because the series had ended by the time of the 1981 film the series title is replaced by the generic term \\"television\\". Production Television writer Margaret Kelly was working at a writing workshop at a suburban theatre where she met Kathy Lette and Gabrielle Carey, who had written a number of unpublished stories about growing up in the surfing beaches of southern Sydney. Kelly showed the stories to producer and writer Joan Long, and optioned the film rights. Carey and Lette went on to write a column in The Sun-Herald as The Salami Sisters and the stories were published under the title Puberty Blues.David Stratton, The Avocado Plantation: Boom and Bust in the Australian Film Industry, Pan MacMillan, 1990 pp. 145‚Äì146 Long first approached Gillian Armstrong to direct but she turned it down. Then Bruce Beresford read the book and wrote asking to direct: > I bought it [the novel] while I was waiting for a bus in North Sydney. I > went to get a chocolate or something and I saw a pile of these things > sitting on the counter. I thought I'd buy one and read it on the bus going > home. It was remarkable, a very well-expressed book. And the girls were only > fifteen. It was a sort of insight into the way of life of those kids, which > was a revelation to me... Kathy Lette was a real livewire and so was the > other girl, Gabrielle Carey.\\"Interview with Bruce Beresford\\", Signet, 15 May > 1999 accessed 17 November 2012 The lead roles were cast after an extensive selection process. Lead actor in the film, Nell Schofield, said that \\"It's a very honest and realistic movie. It touches on this and it touches on that. I really like it. It's subtle and doesn't preach: 'This is the way of life.'\\" Schofield felt that \\"Different sections of the audience will perceive different levels. The parents who go and see it will come out and either believe it or it will give them a bit of a jolt. They'll start looking at their kids a different way and try to bridge the generation gap.\\" She added that \\"The film is feminist in a way. I think it is also a comment on peer group pressure, male chauvinism in teenage groups, school and parent hassles.\\"\\"Movie Stars Overnight\\", TV Week. 23 January 1982, p. 11 Schofield found the surfing scenes easy because she was an avid surfer in real life. \\"Like Debbie, I wanted to be a surfie chick. But once I was, I wanted out before it got too heavy. I hated the alcohol and the drug scene. I saw so many kids fall down on the ground after taking drugs.\\" Of making the film Schofield said \\"We didn't expect any glitter, and we didn't get any. It was hard work.\\" The movie was made with the assistance of the Australian Film Commission, who provided $413,708.\\"Production Blues\\", Cinema Papers, October‚ÄìNovember 1980 p. 312 Soundtrack The theme song \\"Puberty Blues\\" was written by Tim Finn. In the film it was sung by Sharon O'Neill. It was released by Jenny Morris as a single on Mushroom Records in December 1981. Box office Puberty Blues grossed $3,918,000 at the box office in Australia. Home media Puberty Blues was first released on home video in the early 1980s. It made its debut on DVD with a new print by Umbrella Entertainment in 2003. The DVD is compatible with all region codes and includes special features such as the trailer, interviews with Nell Schofield and Bruce Beresford, trivia and biographies.

Legend says there was a Kingdom of Sobrarbe, where a cross appeared upon a tree . The bosque de La Pardina del Se√±or, between Fanlo and Sarvis√©. One of the most spectacular forests in autumn in Europe It became part of the County of Aragon, but in the early 9th century was held for five years by Amrus ibn Yusuf, the governor of Zaragoza, being retaken after his death. Sobrarbe was joined to the County of Ribagorza in the early 10th century through the marriage of Bernard I of Ribagorza to Toda Gal√≠ndez of Aragon, daughter of Galindo Azn√°rez II. However, in the late 10th and early 11th century, a series of incursions from the south left it disorganized and depopulated, and for a time it again fell under Muslim control. This was reversed by Sancho the Great of Pamplona, who reconquered the region in 1015, similarly extending his power into Ribagorza over the subsequent years. Whatever hereditary claim might have existed was subsequently brought to Sancho through his wife Muniadona of Castile, heiress to the Ribagorza counts. Sancho divided the territories he had united, and his third son, Gonzalo, was given the counties of Sobrarbe and Ribagorza. After the death of Gonzalo in 1038, his illegitimate half-brother Ramiro I of Aragon brought Sobrarbe and Ribagorza into his hands, creating the nucleus of the Kingdom of Aragon.

Established in 1948, ACPO provided a forum for chief police officers to share ideas and coordinate their strategic operational responses, and advised government in matters such as terrorist attacks and civil emergencies. ACPO coordinated national police operations, major investigations, cross-border policing, and joint law enforcement. ACPO designated Senior Investigative Officers for major investigations and appointed officers to head ACPO units specialising in various areas of policing and crime reduction. ACPO was led by Chief Constable Sir Hugh Orde, QPM, who was, until 2009, the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. He was elected as president by fellow members of ACPO in April 2009. ACPO was funded by Home Office grants, profits from commercial activities and contributions from the 44 police authorities in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Following the Parker Review into ACPO, it was replaced in 2015 by a new body, the National Police Chiefs' Council, set up under a police collaboration agreement under Section 22A of the Police Act 1996. Background UK policing sprang from local communities in the 1800s. Since the origins of policing, chief officers have regularly associated to discuss and share policing issues. Although ACPO as now recognised was formed in 1948, records of prior bodies go back to the early 1900s. The UK retains a decentralised model of policing based around the settlement which emerged from the Royal Commission on the work of the Police in 1962. ACPO continued to provide a forum for chief officers across 44 local police forces and 13 national areas across England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and provided local forces with agreed national policies and guidelines. Originally more of a gentleman's club, it soon evolved into an effective body for representing senior ranks in the police service. ACPO failed to convince its sponsors to contribute to its survival and in May 2011 the BBC reported that ACPO would run out of money in February 2012 without extra funding. ACPO was half-funded by the Home Office and half by 44 police authorities. A third of police authorities refused to pay in 2010 and another third were undecided. The Association of Police Authorities said the withdrawal of funding by police authorities was \\"partly due to a squeeze on their income\\". ACPO was due to wind up formally in April 2015. Constitutional status Over time, demands for coordination across the police service increased as society changed, for example to take account of new developments in international terrorism and organised crime, or roles such as monitoring offenders on release from prison or working with young people to divert them from crime. In 1997 ACPO was incorporated as a private company limited by guarantee. As a private company, ACPO was not subject to freedom of information legislation. It was not a staff association; the staff association for senior police officers was a separate body, the Chief Police Officers Staff Association (CPOSA). The change in structure from a \\"band of volunteers\\" to a limited company allowed the organisation to employ staff, enter into contracts for accommodation and publish accounts. A number of options were considered for the status of ACPO, including charitable status, but all were discounted. Chief Constables and Commissioners are responsible for the direction and control of policing in their force areas. Although a national body and recognized by the government for consultation, ACPO had no powers of its own, nor any mandate to instruct chief officers. However, the organisation allowed chief officers to form a national policy rather than replicate the work in each of their forces. For example, after the 1980‚Äì81 riots in 27 British cities including in St. Pauls and Brixton ACPO began to prepare the Public Order Manual of Tactical Operations and Related Matters. Police forces began training in its tactics late in 1983. Membership ACPO was not a staff association. It acted for the police service, not its members. The separate Chief Police Officers Staff Association acts for chief officers. ACPO was composed of the chief police officers of the 44 police forces in England & Wales and Northern Ireland, the Deputy Chief Constable and Assistant Chief Constable of 42 of those forces and the Deputy Commissioner, Assistant Commissioner, Deputy Assistant Commissioner and Commanders of the remaining two - the Metropolitan Police and City of London Police. Certain senior non-police staff and senior members of national police agencies and certain other specialised and non-geographical forces in the UK, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands were also members. As of March 2010 there were 349 members of ACPO. The membership elected a full-time President, who held the office of Chief Constable under the Police Reform Act 2002. ACPO bodies ACPO was responsible for several ancillary bodies, which it either funded or which received Home Office funding but which reported to ACPO: =ACPO Criminal Records Office= The ACPO Criminal Records Office (ACRO) was set up in 2006 in response to a perceived gap in the police service's ability to manage criminal records and in particular to improve links to biometric data. The initial aim of ACRO was to provide operational support relating to criminal records and associated biometric data, including DNA and fingerprint recognition. It also issues police certificates, for a fee, needed to obtain immigration visas for countries including Australia, Belgium, Canada, Cayman Islands, New Zealand, South Africa and the United States. The organization continues under the style \\"ACRO Criminal Records Office\\" under the control of Hampshire Constabulary. =ACPO Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service= The Association of Chief Police Officers Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service (AVCIS), later the National Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service (NAVCIS), was managed by ACPO, and was responsible for combating organised vehicle crime and the use of vehicles in crime. =National Community Tension Team= The National Community Tension Team (NCTT) was an ACPO body which monitored religious, racial, or other tensions within communities, and provided liaison between police forces and community organisations. =National Counter Terrorism Security Office= The National Counter Terrorism Security Office was funded by, and reported to, ACPO and advised the British government on its counter terrorism strategy. =Police National Information and Co-ordination Centre= ACPO was responsible for coordinating the national mobilisation of police resources at times of national need through the Police National Information and Co-ordination Centre (PNICC), which it set up in 2003. This included ensuring policing resilience during major events such as emergency response to serious flooding or the investigation of a terrorist attack. PNICC sat alongside the government in COBR (Cabinet Office Briefing Room) to advise on national issues. PNICC also handled support to overseas crises involving UK nationals. It employed three full-time staff, with other staff seconded to it as needed and is funded by contributions from each of the police forces. =Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit= The Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU) was set up in 2010 by ACPO (and run by the Metropolitan Police) to remove unlawful terrorist material content from the Internet with a focus on UK based material. The December 2013 report of the Prime Minister's Extremism task forceTackling extremism in the UK: report by the Extremism Taskforce, GOV.UK, 2013-12-04 said that it would \\"work with internet companies to restrict access to terrorist material online which is hosted overseas but illegal under UK law\\" and \\"work with the internet industry to help them in their continuing efforts to identify extremist content to include in family-friendly filters\\" which would likely involve lobbying ISPs to add the CTIRU list to their filters without the need for additional legislation. =National Wildlife Crime Unit= The National Wildlife Crime Unit is a national police unit that gathers intelligence on wildlife crime and provides analytical and investigative support to law enforcement agencies. Controversies=Freedom of information= ACPO had been criticised as being unaccountable to Parliament or the public by virtue of its limited company status. In October 2009 Sir Hugh Orde stated that ACPO would be \\"more than happy\\" to be subject to the Freedom of Information Act. On 30 March 2010, the Ministry of Justice announced that ACPO would be included under the FOI Act from October 2011. In its response, the organisation stated that \\"Although organisations cannot voluntarily comply with the Act, a large proportion of ACPO's work is public already or available under FOI through any police force\\". In January 2011 its website still said it: \\"is unable to do is to respond to requests for information under the Act. The organisation is too small and there are too few members of staff to be able to conduct the necessary research and to compile the responses\\". From November 2011, however, FOI requests could be made to ACPO.https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/11/08/foi_expansion/ =Apartments= The organisation was criticised in February 2010 for allegedly spending ¬£1.6 million per year from government anti-terrorist funding grants on renting up to 80 apartments in the centre of London which were reported as being empty most of the time. The organisation responded that it had reviewed this policy and would reduce the number of apartments. =Undercover activities= As a result of The Guardian articles with regards to the activities and accusations of PC Mark Kennedy of the National Public Order Intelligence Unit within the National Extremism Tactical Co-ordination Unit, and the collapse of the subsequent trial of six activists, a number of initiatives and changes were announced: *Acknowledging that \\"something had gone very wrong\\" in the Kennedy case to the Home Affairs Select Committee, Home Office minister Nick Herbert stated that ACPO would lose control of three teams involved in tackling domestic extremism. Herbert announced that the units would be transferred to the Metropolitan Police, with acting commissioner Tim Godwin confirming that this would occur at the earliest possible timescale. *Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary announced that Bernard Hogan-Howe would lead an investigation into ACPO, to assess whether undercover operations had been \\"authorised in accordance with law\\" and \\"proportionate\\". *The Association of Police Authorities said it was ending its annual ¬£850,000 grant to ACPO. =DNA database= ACPO has supervised the creation of one of the world's largest per-capita DNA databases, containing the DNA profiles of more than one million innocent people. ACPO's guidelines that these profiles should only be deleted in \\"exceptional circumstances\\" were found to be unlawful by the UK Supreme Court in May 2011. They were found to be incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, following the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights in S and Marper v United Kingdom. On 1 May 2012, the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 completed its passage through Parliament and received Royal Assent. To date, ACPO has not reissued revised guidelines to replace its unlawful DNA exceptional procedure. Big Brother Watch, in a report of June 2012, concludes that despite the Protection of Freedoms Act, the retention of DNA in England and Wales remains an uncertain and illiberal regime. =Fake uniforms= During the summer of 2011, Hugh Orde, then president of the ACPO, was seen wearing a dark blue police-style uniform with ACPO insignia, and was accused of wearing a fake uniform. Senior police officers claimed that the uniform was not that of any police force in the country but \\"closely resembled\\" the uniform worn by former Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Paul Stephenson. Sam Leith, an author, journalist and literary editor of The Spectator, mocked Orde's decision \\"to wear this Gadaffi-style pretend uniform on television\\", and suggested it was \\"a subliminal pitch for the Met Commissioner's job.\\" Brian Paddick, at the time the Police Commander for the London Borough of Lambeth, said: \\"It's unusual for the president of ACPO to appear in all these interviews in uniform. He is sending a clear signal: how would I look in the commissioner's uniform?\\"  Parker Review  In 2013, an independent review of ACPO by General Sir Nick Parker was published. It recommended that ACPO be replaced by a new body, in the interests of greater transparency and cost effectiveness. On the basis of these recommendations, a new organization, the National Police Chiefs' Council, was set up to replace ACPO, which it did on 1 April 2015.

It is mostly a farming community focused on crops and sheep, and holds the world record of 'the most dogs in a ute'. History The name \\"Corrigin\\", of Noongar indigenous origin, was first recorded in 1877 relating to a well in the area. The meaning of the name is unknown. Before 1908 Corrigin's only connection with the rest of the state was the railway track that ran to Merredin and it was difficult to get anyone to take up land near the rabbit proof fence. Most of the land as once held by George Walton on a pastoral lease which he ran from his homestead at Wogerlin rock. The first settlers to the area were Mr A. W. Goyder (the son of the South Australian Surveyor General), who took up the area on which the town now stands. He was followed by Jack Crossland then by Messrs Gayfer and Jose Bros. In 1909, the Government planned to build a railway from BrooktonCross Country to Corrigin Milne, Rod Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, April, 1988 pp80-86 on the Great Southern Railway to the town of Kunjin, 17 km west of Corrigin. Some time after, a line from Wickepin was also proposed, and the Government decided to locate the crossing point at Corrigin.All Change at Corrigin Milne, Rod Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin, March, 1996 pp67-75 A storm swept through the area in 1913 lashing the area with hailstones over in diameter. The town was also deluged with over of rain in a few hours. Standing crops were flattened, fences in low-lying areas were washed away and most of the town was submerged under at least of water. In 1913, a railway siding was built, and named \\"Dondakin\\" by railway authorities due to conflict with the name elsewhere. However, after much local protest, the siding was renamed Corrigin and gazetted on 15 May 1914. The railway line from Wickepin, Western Australia opened a month later, and the main office of the local Road Board moved to the town. In 1915, a school was built. In 1932 the Wheat Pool of Western Australia announced that the town would have two grain elevators, each fitted with an engine, installed at the railway siding. The bulk handling facility had been installed by November the following year and the first trial load of wheat was satisfactorily loaded. By 1937 the town boasted a hall that cost ¬£8,000 to build, a large state hotel, commercial buildings, bowling green, tennis course, golf course and one of the best showgrounds in the state. The town still had no adequate water scheme, there was no lack of well water but the water drawn was very hard. The wheatbelt was struck by drought for much of 1939 and nearly all of 1940, described at the time as the worst in the states history until heavy rains arrived in December of that year. Corrigin received of drought-breaking rain over a couple of days. The town was lashed by a violent storm on New Year's Day in 2013. Destructive winds and of rain tore through over the course of an hour leaving behind fallen powerlines, uprooted trees, sheds torn apart and roofs ripped from homes. Present day Corrigin has a population of 903 and is a key agricultural centre for a district focussed mainly on wheat and sheep farming. It is the location of a CBH management zone office,Zone 7 in the Kwinana Port Zone and in 1973 was the location of a 'type B' wheat bin. It contains a district high school (originally opened 1915 as a primary school), National Australia bank, shopping facilities, accommodation (hotel, motel, caravan park), council offices and a telecentre. Each year, it hosts an agricultural show. The town is a stop on the Transwa bus service to Esperance via Kulin/Hyden.GE2 timetable (26 November 2017). Retrieved on 14 June 2018.

He became known as a victim of a miscarriage of justice for having served three years' hard labour after being convicted on a charge of injuring a pony. He was initially regarded having been responsible for the series of animal mutilations known as the 'Great Wyrley Outrages', but the prosecution case against him became regarded as weak and prejudiced. He was pardoned on the grounds of the conviction being an unsafe one after a campaign in which Sir Arthur Conan Doyle took a prominent role. The difficulty in overturning the conviction of Edalji was cited as showing that a better mechanism was needed for reviewing unsafe verdicts, and it was a factor in the 1907 creation of the Court of Criminal Appeal for England. Despite an official inquiry's finding that Edalji was the author of poison pen letters associated with the mutilations, he was allowed to resume practice as a solicitor and lived quietly with a sibling until his death. Background Edalji was the eldest of the three children. His mother was Charlotte Edalji (n√©e Stoneham), the daughter of a Shropshire vicar. His father was the Reverend Shapurji Edalji, a convert from a Bombay Parsi family. He had served as the curate in several parishes before being given the living as vicar of St. Mark's, Great Wyrley. The right to make this appointment lay with the bishop, and the Reverend Edalji obtained the position through the previous incumbent, his wife's uncle, who arranged it as a wedding present. Livings were much sought after because they were scarce and conferred valuable emoluments. The Reverend Edalji moved into the vicarage in late 1875, it was a large house with its own grounds; George, the first child, was born there soon after. The Reverend Edalji was more assertive than his predecessor and was sometimes involved in controversy about parish business. Many modern writers on the case express the opinion that rural English society was infected with backward racialist attitudes, and that this would have been particularly true of a village like Great Wyrley which may well have had the first South Asian to become the incumbent of an English parish..Christian, Paul.

Accessed 20 September 2015. =Anonymous letters of 1888= Anonymous threatening letters were sent to the vicarage in 1888, when George Edalji was twelve and a half, demanding that the Reverend order a particular newspaper and threatening to break windows if this was not done. He ignored them. Windows were broken and a threat was made to shoot the Reverend; he became alarmed and called in the police. Graffiti was written slandering the Edaljis on the inside and outside walls of the vicarage. Pseudonymous letters were sent to the vicarage maid-of-all-work, 17-year-old Elizabeth Foster, threatening to shoot her when her \\"Black master\\" was out. One was found inside the hall with the envelope wet; the letter was written on pages from the exercise books of the Edalji children.Weaver, G. (2006). Conan Doyle and the Parson's Son: The George Edalji Case. Cambridge, GBR: Vanguard, , see , accessed 20 September 2015. The circumstances made it clear that either Foster or Edalji was responsible. Foster was implicated by assertions made by Edalji; the Reverend, his wife, and police Sergeant Upton thought that they perceived similarities between Foster's handwriting and that of the pseudonymous threatening letters. The Reverend prosecuted Foster for writing the letters, which she denied doing. He offered to drop the case if Foster confessed, but she refused and went to live with an aunt. Foster, unable to pay for a defence at trial, pleaded guilty in front of the magistrates in exchange for being given probation, but continued maintaining her innocence thereafter. The Reverend congratulated Upton for his performance.Weaver asserts that Captain Anson disapproved of Upton obtaining the conviction of Foster, which may have affected the way in which Upton dealt with the later 1892 letters, but apparently does not cite his source for that information. Weaver also says that Anson later \\"disingenuously\\" denied that he had been aware of the 1888 letters at the time that they happened. Weaver (2006), op. cit. p. 34. =Letters and malicious mischief of 1892= In 1892, a member of the parish council named W.H. Brookes received obscene letters that included accounts of his adult daughter sexually abusing her 10 year-old sister. The letters mentioned Edalji among others at first, but increasingly concentrated on Edalji and the Reverend, sometimes using a phrase (\\"the blackman\\") that had occurred in 1888 letters attributed to Elizabeth Foster. One letter was made in two distinctly different handwritings. The letters to Brookes accused his son of writing the 1888 letters to the vicarage which had been attributed to Elizabeth Foster, and of giving them to George Edalji to post. Reverend Edalji and a vicarage servant also got letters, in which the Reverend was accused of \\"gross immorality with persons using Vaseline in the same way as did Oscar Wilde\\".Conan Doyle and the Parson's Son: The George Edalji Case, Gordon Weaver, p65 Letters purporting to be from the Reverend Edalji were sent to other vicars. Brookes and Reverend Edalji called in the police, and Sergeant Upton again found himself investigating poison pen letters to the vicar. Attempts to get the post office to identify the sender failed as the mailed letters ceased. Notes began appearing at the vicarage (a total of over 70), and various objects were left on the doorstep, including a bag of excrement. Police kept watch and claimed to have established that the key, stolen from Walsall Grammar School six miles away (where George Edalji was a student) that had appeared on the doorstep had done so in a time frame when only George Edalji had used the entrance.Justice Denied: Extraordinary miscarriages of justice By James Morton Following this, excrement was smeared on the outside of upstairs windows, and Upton decided that George had been responsible for the letters. It was about this time that The Rev Edalji began sharing a bedroom with George; the arrangement continued for the next 17 years. A police ploy, which was clearly aimed at getting Edalji to incriminate himself as the note writer, brought forth protests from his mother at the way the investigation was focusing on him. She and her husband demanded that Foster be arrested. A campaign of hoax ordering of goods and services for the vicarage lasted for 3 years. Police largely ceased investigating the incidents. In response to her protests, Chief Constable of the county Captain Anson told Mrs. Edalji that she should make a serious effort to help catch the culprit if she wanted his men to spend more time on the matter, as it was obviously either her husband or son. Reverend Edalji threatened to complain to higher authority about the conduct of Anson. The notes and hoaxes ceased in December 1895. =Perceptions of Edalji= Brookes came to believe that Edalji was the author of the 1892 poison pen letters. He said that Edalji had smiled at him in the railway station, to which Brookes had responded with a disagreeable look, thereafter, Brookes asserted, the letters began to refer to him as \\"sour face\\". Brookes also said that the letters to him stopped after he had swung punches at Edalji on the platform. Edalji was hired at a legal firm as a trainee solicitor and scored exceptionally high marks in his professional examinations but was not taken on as a newly qualified solicitor. In 1899, his family helped him set up on his own, working out of an office in Birmingham and sometimes from the vicarage. He was described as looking younger than his age, of a rather peculiar appearance, and solitary, being given to taking evening strolls by himself.Conan Doyle and the Parson's Son: The George Edalji Case by Gordon Weaver p74 A couple of roughs were fined for hitting him while he was on one of his evening walks three miles from his house one night in 1900; the assailants were not from Great Wyrley or known to Edalji. His book Railway Law for the ‚ÄòMan in the train‚Äô was published in 1901. A solicitor, clerk to the court and friend on Anston, C.A. Loxton, was later to accuse Edalji of writing \\"immoral and offensive\\" allegations on walls about Loxton and his fianc√©e. Most present-day commenters on the case take the view that the traditional culture in a Staffordshire village of the time would make George Edalji an object of suspicion because of his racial heritage, but he appears to have had attracted favourable comment for his book, and had been trusted enough to have clients among local small businessmen. =Financial misfortune = As a result of having agreed to stand surety for a fellow solicitor (who then absconded), Edalji became being liable for a debt of nine thousand pounds. In December 1902 his creditors threatened him with bankruptcy unless he paid a hundred of the amount immediately. Initially Edalji wrote begging letters, but he appears to have obtained the demanded payment, possibly by going to his parents.D. Michael Risinger, page 49 International Commentary on Evidence, V 4, I 2 2006 Boxes in Boxes: Edalji Case 1903 letters and animal maiming In Jan 1903, when Edalji was 27 years old, a series of slashings occurred against horses and other livestock, known as the 'Great Wyrley Outrages'. A horse was maimed on 1 February 1903, two horses were similarly wounded on 29 June 1903, and a number of other animals received injuries resulting in their being put down. Isolated cases of livestock maiming were not unheard of as a way of settling scores in farming communities, but the series of attacks provoked a public outcry far beyond the area. Police received pseudonymous letters purporting to be from one of a gang of culprits, and the letters named real people as members of the gang, including Edalji. Several others named in the letters were schoolboys whom Edalji regularly commuted with in the same train compartment. A letter was also sent to Edalji purporting to be from one of them, 15-year-old Wilfred Greatorex. =Investigation= Staffordshire Chief Constable Captain Anson was an administrator without experience of investigatory police work. He believed that Edalji was the author of the letters, but someone of his professional status could have had no involvement in the animal maimings. Inspector Campbell headed enquiries into the maimings and from an early stage considered Edalji a person of particular interest, although there were a number of suspects. The exact nature of circumstantial evidence that led to suspicion falling on Edalji is unknown, but according to what Anson privately alleged years later, Edalji had a reputation for roaming the area at night and, on two occasions, trails of footprints from attack locations seemed to lead to the vicarage. Most of the crimes had occurred within a half mile radius of the vicarage. On 29 June, two horses were mutilated. Following this, the seventh attack, Campbell felt sure that Edalji was responsible for the maimings because he reportedly had been seen late that evening in the field where it took place. Inspector Campbell began to focus on Edalji for the mutilations. Then a July 1903 letter threateningly predicted that \\"little girls\\" would be the target of the next attacks. Anson agreed to a watch being kept on the vicarage and nearby countryside. There were rumours that Edalji was going to be arrested for the attacks, and he offered a reward for information about who was spreading them. His habit of taking walks continued, and he returned from one at around 9 pm on 17 August. Early on 18 August, a wounded pony was discovered, half a mile from the scene of the first attack. Inspector Campbell sent a constable to the railway station where Edalji was waiting to catch his train, asking him to help with inquiries, but he declined and left for Birmingham. Inspector Campbell went to the vicarage with a sergeant and constable, and asked to see any weapons in the house; a small trowel was the only thing shown to them. Edalji's clothing was also asked for; it included muddy boots as well as mud-stained serge trousers and a housecoat‚Äîboth of which the police said were damp. The inspector said that there was a hair on the housecoat, whereupon there was a dispute between the Inspector and the Reverend over whether something visible on the housecoat was a hair or a loose thread. The next day, police searched the vicarage and found a case with four razors in the bedroom that Edalji shared with his father. Reverend Edalji said that the razors were old ones not in use. According to the police, they pointed out that one razor was wet; the Reverend took it and wiped the blade with his thumb; he later said that this was not true. Police said that a heel on the boots was worn down in an unusual way and left a distinctive pattern on the ground that matched heel impressions in an alleged trail of footprints between the vicarage and the scene of the crime. A local doctor who examined the housecoat for the police said that it was bloodstained, and there were 29 hairs on it similar to ones from the pony's hide near the wound. The doctor said that the hairs were small and difficult to see. Home Office officials later considered it highly unlikely that police would have gone on to fabricate evidence by planting the hairs after the Edaljis had vehemently drawn attention to the absence of hairs on the housecoat while it was handed over.The Rev Edalji protested that his son did not have the key to the locked door of the room in which they slept, but contemporaries did not consider the by then 27 years' old George sleeping in the same room as his father a normal arrangement.  Conviction and campaign for pardon Edalji consistently maintained that he was innocent of all charges. He pleaded not guilty to injuring the pony; an indictment was not tried for sending a letter threatening to kill a policeman. The trial was moved out of the village, which meant that the jury was of people who did not know Edalji. The prosecution accused Edalji of having left the house and attacked the pony in the early hours of the morning. The Reverend said that he had hardly slept that night and knew that Edalji could not have left the bedroom which they shared, the door of which he had locked as usual. According to Richard Davenport-Hines, writing in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. > The case arrayed against young Edalji was preposterous. As an astigmatic > myopic he was incapable of complicated nocturnal excursions; the vicarage > was surrounded on the night of 17 August by a cordon of men through which he > could not have penetrated; apparently incriminating dirty razors found in a > police search of the vicarage were stained with rust, not blood; putatively > incriminating mud found on his clothes and boots did not come from the field > where the horse was slaughtered; horse hairs which police claimed to have > found on his coat were probably threads; his father‚Äôs sworn oath that they > had slept the night in the same room behind a locked door was disregarded. > After George Edalji was condemned to seven years‚Äô penal servitude, his > family was brutally baited. Edalji‚Äôs defence did not hire experts to testify about his poor eyesight, nor did Edalji himself mention it at trial, only subsequently was it to be the main grounds for his campaign to be recognised as innocent. He later said that he had been told by his lawyers that the prosecution case was so weak it was unnecessary to bring up how poor his vision was, but he also admitted that he could move about at night quite well as long as the road was a main one and familiar to him. The initial prosecution theory about the mutilations having taken place in the evening was contradicted by much evidence and the case against Edalji was weakened as a result. The police sergeant and inspector differed on whether there was no watch on the vicarage at all on the night or only one man, but they agreed there was no cordon, and the prosecution modified their allegations to assert the attack on the pony had come in the early hours of the morning. Edalji was convicted and sentenced to seven years hard labour. Some 10,000 signatures, including hundreds from lawyers, were on petitions that protested the conviction. Some legal figures thought that it was improper under English evidence law as it then was for Edalji to be sent for trial charged with separate offences of sending a threatening letter and a pony maiming, and then having evidence about letters used to help convict him of the maiming, which was the sole offence for which he was then being tried. R.D. Yelverton, former Chief Justice in the Bahamas, thought that the case for the prosecution had been conclusively disproved. He asked: ‚ÄúHow could a gentleman in the position and of the education of Mr. Edalji, be supposed to write the following, put by the Prosecution before the Jury, as written by him. (They were sent either to the Police or to himself). ‚ÄòYou great hulking blackguard and coward I have got you fixed you dirty Cad ‚Äì bloody monkey!‚Äô‚ÄùYelverton, R.D. (1906). Letter Written by R.D. Yelverton in Support of George Edalji. Birmingham City Council (online), at \\"Things to do: Libraries, Archives, and Heritage\\"; The George Edalji Case, see , accessed 20 September 2015. Senior civil servants at the Home Office reviewed the case and reported that there were no serious flaws in the trial and conviction of Edalji. He was paroled after serving three years. =Conan Doyle= Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, then second only to Rudyard Kipling as a celebrated British writer, became the most influential supporter of the public campaign for Edalji‚Äôs pardon. The weight that Conan Doyle‚Äôs opinion on the case carried with the public stemmed from the appeal of his fictional master detective Sherlock Holmes, which associated the author with Holmesian traits of close attention to detail and drawing logical inferences. Conan Doyle arrived to meet with Edalji at a hotel after becoming interested in the case, and he recalled that he paused to study Edalji, who was passing the time reading a newspaper while waiting in the lobby. On observing how Edalji held the paper at an angle inches from his face, Conan Doyle was convinced that Edalji was innocent; he believed it impossible for someone with eyesight as bad as Edalji‚Äôs to have moved through the countryside after nightfall attacking animals and successfully evading the police. Anson corresponded with Conan Doyle and met with him in January 1907 to discuss the case, but relations became acrimonious between them two days later when Anson was informed by Conan Doyle that he intended to campaign for Edalji to be given a pardon. Anson thought that a firm conclusion could not have been reached from a neutral standpoint in that amount of time, and that Conan Doyle had obtained his co-operation and an interview by misrepresenting himself as having no settled opinion about the case. Conan Doyle wrote to the Home Office saying that Anson had implied homosexual incest between the Reverend and Edalji. Anson insisted that he did no such thing. 1907 letters The same day that Conan Doyle wrote his letter of intent to Captain Anson, a long pseudonymous letter was sent to Conan Doyle, Edalji, and Anson with apparent inside knowledge of the arguments which Conan Doyle intended to publish, the first of a spate about the case that they received. It purported to be by a private detective who had been summoned to the vicarage; this was similar to an ingenious deception perpetrated during the hoax campaign of 1892, when a female private detective was led to believe that she was working for Mrs. Edalji to investigate suspected infidelity by the Reverend. It has been questioned whether the detailed knowledge of incidents at the vicarage and Edalji‚Äôs professional life that were demonstrated in the letter could have come from anyone not at the centre of those events or part of the investigation into them. Attribution of the letters is further complicated by police having used the ploy of sending pseudonymous letters to Edalji on a couple of occasions before his arrest. The ‚Äúprivate detective‚Äù letter of 1907 ostensibly offered to help Edalji, but seemed to be an obvious trap. It has been suggested that the letters were aimed at disrupting the campaign to have him granted a pardon. See footnote 32 in Weaver (2006), op. cit. The police handwriting consultant said that the letter was by Edalji in his ‚ÄòGreatorex‚Äô hand. Police believed that such letters had ceased while Edalji was in prison, and they attributed those pseudonymous or anonymous letters about the case received when Edalji was in gaol to persons other than the author of the 1903 pseudonymous ‚ÄòGreatorex‚Äô letters, which police believed was Edalji. Poison pen letters in the name of the ‚ÄúWyrley Gang‚Äù continued until the 1930s, by an offender who also wrote to people connected to other crimes in the news. Anon. (1934). Labourer Sent to Penal Servitude. The Times (London), 7 November 1934 [at Casebook: Jack the Ripper (online)], see . Accessed 20 September 2015. Campaign Conan Doyle became an active investigator, going to the crime scenes, interviewing participants, and critiquing the reliability of the witness who testified that peculiarities found in the handwriting of Edalji also occurred in the 1903 pseudonymous ‚ÄòGreatorex‚Äô letters to police, which named Edalji as a culprit in the animal mutilations. Legal technicalities made the evidence controversial concerning the letters being used to convict Edalji, because he was not tried on the charge of sending a threatening letter. Opinion within the Home Office was split on the matter. Conan Doyle thought that he had identified the person as a certain Royden Sharp who was behind the pseudonymous letters of 1892 and 1903 and the maimings. There have been a variety of opinions since about whether he was justified in his belief, although Peter Costello wrote a modern book on Conan Doyle‚Äôs investigations and concurred with his conclusion. Pardon Newspapers suggested that visual impairment would have made it impossible for Edalji to have committed the crime. Captain Anson told the Home Office that he thought that Edalji was physically more than capable of the nocturnal maiming, asserting that Edalji had a panther-like gait and eyes that ‚Äúcame out with a strange sort of glow, like a cat‚Äôs eyes‚Äù in a low light.Risinger, D. Michael. (2006). Boxes in Boxes: Julian Barnes, Conan Doyle, Sherlock Holmes and the Edalji Case. International Commentary on Evidence, 4 (2), Article 3, pp. 1‚Äì90, see According to Anson's communications with the Home Office about the case, an assertion was ‚Äúindisputably false‚Äù that Edalji made in a letter published in a newspaper to the effect that he was not abroad after nightfall. Anson said that several people remembered coming across Edalji very late at night and miles from his house during 1903. Conan Doyle‚Äôs articles in support may have been a key factor in getting the authorities to commission a committee of inquiry. Edalji was granted a pardon for the maiming conviction in May 1907, though the inquiry found that he had brought prosecution upon himself by sending the pseudonymous ‚ÄòGreatorex‚Äô letters to police during the summer of 1903, which meant that he was not given compensation. Aftermath Edalji‚Äôs case and the associated campaign were factors in the creation of England‚Äôs Court of Criminal Appeal in 1907. A June 1907 memo by Home secretary Herbert Gladstone was discovered 80 years later, which revealed that one of the lawyers who had represented Edalji had privately told Gladstone of suppressing a letter by Edalji, which his brother Horace had brought as a specimen of Edalji‚Äôs handwriting, because it was damaging to the defence‚Äôs case. It consisted of obscenities similar to ones that Edalji was accused of sending. When the 1907 letters started, the lawyer‚Äôs colleague remarked ‚ÄúHe is at it again.‚Äù In November 1907, Edalji was accepted back on to the roll of solicitors in good standing and allowed to practice, despite the Committee of Inquiry‚Äôs conclusion that he had written some of the 1903 letters. His sister Maud moved in with him, and they lived together in Welwyn Garden City until his death in 1953. In 2013 Solicitor-General Oliver Heald said that the trial of Edalji had been a farce. In popular culture Edalji's case was the subject of the 1966 German feature film Conan Doyle und der Fall Edalji.https://www.arthur-conan- doyle.com/index.php?title=Conan_Doyle_und_der_Fall_Edalji An episode of the 1972 BBC anthology TV series The Edwardians about Conan Doyle centres on his involvement in the Edajli case. It was written by Jeremy Paul, directed by Brian Farnham, and stars Nigel Davenport as Conan Doyle, Sam Dastor as George Edalji, and Renu Setna as the Reverend Edalji. A BBC radio drama, Conan Doyle Investigates, part of the Saturday Night Theatre series, was aired in May 1972. The script was written by Roger Woddis and the play produced by Anthony Cornish. Conan Doyle was played by Carleton Hobbs, Alfred Wood by Graham Armitage and George Edalji by Brian Hewlett.https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/5601330a91bf45b08180ca19f9f0771e Conan Doyle's Strangest Case, a radio play by Tony Mulholland was first broadcast on BBC Radio in 1995, starring Peter Jeffrey as Conan Doyle, Frances Jeater as Kathleen Moriarty and Kim Wall as George Edalji.

He was a founding member of the band Slapp Happy, worked with Henry Cow and has made a number of solo albums, including Flying Doesn't Help (1979) and World Service (1981). As a lyricist, Moore has collaborated with Pink Floyd on two of their albums: A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994), and contributed music to the instrumental \\"Calling\\" from The Endless River (2014). He contributed lyrics to Richard Wright's Broken China (1996), worked with Kevin Ayers on various projects and also contributed lyrics to Trevor Rabin's Can't Look Away (1989) and Julian Lennon's Help Yourself (1991). Biography Anthony Moore's musical career began when he met Peter Blegvad, while both were students at St Christopher School, Letchworth. They played in various bands, including Slapp Happy (the name was a reference to Blegvad's then- girlfriend) and the Dum-Dums. After school Moore studied Indian classical music with Viram Jasani in 1969, and went on to compose his first film soundtrack for David Larcher's Mare's Tale. In 1971 Moore moved to Hamburg, Germany and worked in Hamburg's experimental music scene, recording two minimalist albums for Polydor Germany. In 1972 Blegvad visited Moore in Hamburg and, along with Moore's girlfriend (and soon to be wife) Dagmar Krause,Cutler 2009, vol. 1‚Äì5, p. 21,40. Moore (guitar, keyboards), Blegvad (guitar) and Krause (vocals) formed the avant-pop trio, Slapp Happy. Moore and Blegvad composed the band's music. Slapp Happy recorded two albums for Polydor Germany with krautrock group Faust as their backing band. Polydor released the first, Sort Of in 1972, but rejected the second, Casablanca Moon. This rejection prompted Slapp Happy to relocate to London where they signed up with Virgin Records and re-recorded Casablanca Moon, released in 1974 by Virgin as Slapp Happy. (The original Casablanca Moon was later released by Recommended Records as Acnalbasac Noom in 1980.) In 1974 Slapp Happy merged briefly with avant-rock group Henry Cow, recording two albums in 1975, Desperate Straights and In Praise of Learning. However soon after recording the second album, first Moore, then Blegvad left the amalgamation on account of incompatibilities with the group. Blegvad remarked that the \\"chords and the time signatures were too complicated.\\" But Krause elected to remain with Henry Cow and that spelt the end of Slapp Happy. Moore and Blegvad parted company at this point, but participated in brief Slapp Happy reunions in 1982, 1997, 2000 and 2016‚Äì2017. Moore, Blegvad and Krause also collaborated in 1991 on the specially commissioned opera 'Camera', which was made by the production company After Image and was broadcast two years later on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom. After leaving Henry Cow/Slapp Happy, Moore relaunched his solo career in 1977 by releasing Out on Virgin Records, with backing by Kevin Ayers and Andy Summers. Out, however, was not commercial enough for Virgin, and they cancelled Moore's contract. In 1979 and 1981 Moore recorded Flying Doesn't Help and World Service, respectively on independent labels. Both albums were well received. The song \\"World Service\\", inspired by the BBC World Service, was released as a single and combines shortwave radio with heavy dance beats. Moore has worked in various European locations as a freelance composer, writing songs and film scores. He produced a number of albums, including This Heat's debut album, Angel Station by Manfred Mann's Earth Band (in conjunction with Mann who later covered his song \\"World Service\\"). Moore also collaborated with Pink Floyd on three of their albums. In 1996 Moore was appointed professor for research into sound and music in the context of new media at the Academy of Media Arts in Cologne, Germany. From 2000 to 2004 he was the principal of the Academy of Media Arts. Moore has also travelled to many European locations, presenting lectures on sound and music. In 2002 Moore formed a music trio with J√∂rg Lindenmaier and Peter C. Simon called LMS, named after the first letters of their surnames. They performed in France and Germany between 2002 and 2003. Krause, Moore and Blegvad reformed Slapp Happy in November 2016 to perform with Faust at the Week-End festival in Cologne, Germany. The two groups also played together on 10‚Äì11 February 2017 at Cafe Oto in London. On 24 February 2017 Slapp Happy, without Faust, performed at Mt. Rainer Hall, Shibuya in Tokyo.

The film was written by, directed by, and stars Albert Brooks. It also stars Meryl Streep, Rip Torn, Lee Grant, and Buck Henry. The film was shot in and around Los Angeles, California. Despite its comedic overtones, Defending Your Life contains elements of drama and allegory. Plot Los Angeles advertising executive Daniel Miller dies in a car accident on his 39th birthday and is sent to Judgment City, a Purgatory-like waiting area populated by the recently deceased, where he will have his life on Earth judged. Daniel and the rest of the departed are offered many Earth-like amenities and activities while they undergo their judgment processes‚Äîfrom delicious, calorie-free all-you-can-eat buffets, to bowling alleys and comedy clubs. Daniel's defense attorney, Bob Diamond, explains that people from Earth use so little of their brains (only three to five percent) that they spend most of their lives functioning on the basis of their fears. \\"When you use more than five percent of your brain, you don't want to be on Earth, believe me,\\" says Diamond. If the court determines that Daniel has conquered his fears, he will be sent on to the next phase of existence, where he will be able to use more of his brain and thus be able to experience more of what the universe has to offer. Otherwise, his soul will be reincarnated on Earth to live another life in another attempt at moving past his fears. At Daniel's tribunal, presided over by two judges, Diamond argues that Daniel should move onto the next phase, but his formidable opponent, Lena Foster, takes the opposing argument. Each utilizes video-like footage from select days in Daniel's life to make their case to the judges. During the procedure, Daniel meets and falls in love with Julia, a recently deceased woman who lived a seemingly perfect life of courage and generosity, especially compared to his. Meanwhile, things do not go well for Daniel. Foster shows a series of episodes in which Daniel did not overcome his fears, as well as various other bad decisions and mishaps, while Diamond vigorously attempts to portray Daniel's actions in a more positive light. Following each day's proceedings, Daniel and Julia spend time exploring Judgement City. On the last day of the hearing, Foster plays footage of Daniel's previous night with Julia, in which he declines to spend the night with her despite his strong feelings for her. Foster believes this clearly underscores Daniel's fear and lack of courage. It is ruled that Daniel will return to Earth. Meanwhile, Julia is judged worthy to move on. Before saying goodbye, Diamond comforts Daniel with the knowledge that the court is not infallible and just because Foster won it doesn't mean she's right. Daniel remains disappointed. Daniel boards a tram poised to return to Earth when he spots Julia on a different tram. On impulse, he unstraps himself, leaps from the moving tram, dodges traffic and suffers electric shocks and injury to get to Julia. Unable to enter her tram, he clings precariously to the outside of the moving vehicle, banging on the door and trying to pry it open. The scene pulls back to show that the entire event is being watched by Diamond, Foster, and the judges in the chamber where Daniel's hearing took place. Diamond remarks to Foster, \\"Brave enough for you?\\" Foster has no reply other than letting a bit of a smile slip as well. One of the judges sends a message ordering the tram doors opened. Daniel and Julia are reunited, to the applause of the other passengers, and embrace as they are allowed to move on to the next phase of existence together.

It is considered an ancient breed of horse, particularly well adapted to the harsh mountain areas it traditionally inhabits. Once common, it is endangered through habitat loss, mechanization and crossbreeding but efforts are increasingly made to safeguard the future of this breed. It is considered iconic by the Basque people. Etymology Pottoka is the Basque language name for this horse, both north and south of the mountains. In Upper Navarrese, potto and pottoka are generic terms for colts and young horses whereas in Lapurdian and Lower Navarrese the meaning of pottoka is \\"pony\\".Trask, L. Etymological Dictionary of Basque, edited for web publication by Max Wheeler, University of Sussex 2008 Ultimately the name is linked to words such as pottolo \\"chubby, tubby\\". In French sources, the spelling Pottok predominates. In English, both Pottoka and Pottok are encounteredMorris, M. Euskara Ingelese Hiztegia Klaudio Harluxet Fundazioa: 1998 but the term Basque Pony can occasionally also be encountered.Moro, P. & Intxausti de Casal, JI Estudio zoom√©trico en la raza poni vasco-pottoka Archivos de zootecnica Vol 47 Num 178‚Äì179, 1998 Origins Paleolithic paintings of horses in the Ekainberri cave near Ekain, in Zestoa. Many opinions exist on the origins of the Pottok. It is deemed by the scientific community to have lived in the area for at least several thousand years. It displays signs of genetic isolation and is genetically closest to breeds like the Asturc√≥n, the Losino, the Galician, the Landais, and the Monchino horses. Tests have revealed considerable genetic differences between populations in the Northern Basque Country and the Southern Basque Country, leading some to consider them separate breeds. Pottoks bred by the ZAPE Society Some claim the Pottok's origins derive from the horses on ancient cave paintings in the area and thus claim to descend from the Magdalenian horses of 14,000‚Äì7000 BC. Other link its origins to an influx of horses during the Bronze Age. However, neither of these theories has to date been scientifically verified.Aizpuru, ML Pottoka: Liraina, librea, aintzinakoa Zientzia.net, retrieved 16.11.2009 Pottoks on a coat of arms in Zestoa. Genetic research by the University of the Basque Country's Genetics, Physical Anthropology and Animal Physiology department into various genetic markers amongst the 4 indigenous horse breeds in the Basque Country have examined their relationship to other horses. Based on microsatellite tests, of the four Basque horse breeds, the Pottok and the Basque Mountain Horse, are genetically the most distant from other breeds. The others, the Burguete horse and the Jaca Navarra (today considered meat breeds), less so.Andonegi, G. Euskal Herriko zaldiak Zientzia.net, retrieved 16.11.2009 This variability in the Pottok and the Basque Mountain Horse appears to be related to the fact males mate range more widely and mate with more females in these feral or semi-feral herds. Research into a known single-nucleotide polymorphism showed this non-native alternation is very rare in purebred Pottoks. Tests of mitochondrial DNA revealed Pottoks are most likely to crossbreed with the Basque Mountain Horses, less so with other breeds. Although some genetic markers of other European horse breeds were found, overall the genetic distance to the other European breeds is large. One marker previously only found in certain British breeds has also been found in Pottoks. Habitat Its traditional range extends west as far as the Biscayan Encartaciones and east roughly as far as the Saint-Jean-le-Vieux area. A census carried out in 1970 found roughly 3.500 purebred Pottoks north of the Pyrenees and approximately 2.000 purebreds to the south, a considerable drop from historic populations, linked to an overall drop in the number of horses being bred and used commercially. Competition with sheep and more recently commercial forestry has also infringed on the Pottok's natural habitat. The traditional core habitat are the mountains of Labourd and Navarre from about 1.500m upwards, generally on poor acidic soil and limestone formations. Characteristics The Pottok measures in height, and weighs between . It has a large, square head, small ears, short neck and long back with short but slim legs, and small, sturdy hooves. Pottoks with the heavy winter coat, (the borra) The winter fur (borra) is one of the key characteristics of the Pottok and can reach up to in length on young horses. The archetypal coat colorations are in bay range with no patterning, but today various shades of brown and black exist in Pottok herds. Pottok pintos first appeared in Biscay in the 1850s and have spread to parts of Navarre and Labourd since. There are noticeable differences between mountain herds of Pottok and valley or flatland herds, with mountain horses generally being smaller. The official French breed standard distinguishes two types, the or Mountain Pottok, with a height range of , and the larger or Plains Pottok, which has a height range of .Standard officiel de la race Pottok Les Haras Nationaux 2005 (in French) Accessed August 2011 \\"Official standard of the Pottok breed\\" The Government of Biscay carried out research into some 250 horses of the Pottok population of Biscay, both wild and stabled, in 1996‚Äì97. The census revealed that the majority of semi-feral Pottoks in Biscay live in the far northwest of the province, in the Encartaciones. These semi-feral herds are rounded up twice a year, once in March before birthing and once in October after weaning. The survey also concluded that the main characteristics of the Biscayan population were: *black or blackish coats dominating (73%), followed by bays with (19%) *Height range , average height *long, slim legs with black hooves *large, heavy heads *a heavy winter coat (the borra) =Behavior= Semi-feral Pottoks tend to be shy and live in small, territorial herds or harems numbering between 10‚Äì30 mares. They are able to predict the weather conditions, moving into the valleys in anticipation of bad weather and upland when high pressure builds. During the autumn, the herd breaks up into smaller groups of 5‚Äì10 horses and re-unite in spring. Foals mature quickly. Fillies become fertile at age 2, normally mate at age 3 and give birth at age 4, which is also the age of maturity for males. Foals, like those of other breeds, are born after 11 months during spring/early summer and are weaned after 6‚Äì7 months. =Cross- breeding= Ainhoa. Pottok numbers have been severely reduced by habitat loss and crossbreeding. In the 20th century, piebald Pottoks were bred, particularly for circus use. Stockier ponies for agricultural work were bred by crossbreeding with draught horses, also often with a large variety of coat colours. They have also been bred with Iberian horses following guidelines of pony clubs, Arabian horses and Welsh ponies. This cross-breeding has left perhaps no more than 150 purebred mares north of the Pyrenees. Use A Pottok used by the military in the Third Carlist War. Their adaptation to mountain life and coloration made them ideal for use by smugglers in former times. From the 16th Century onwards, they became popular as circus horses but also as pit ponies in France and Britain. Today, they are in demand as children's ponies because they adapt well to domestication. Conservation Efforts are now being made to ensure the continued survival of purebred Pottoks. The Pottok was the first Basque horse breed to be included in the list of indigenous Basque breeds requiring conservation efforts in June 1995.Decree 373/2001 Bolet√≠n N. 2002014 ‚Äì 21 January 2002, Government of Euskadi; retrieved 18.11.2009 Its status was classified as endangered. Various reserves, for example in Bidarray in Lower Navarre or the ZAPE Society in the Aralar Range have been set up to protect the pony and its environment. There is much debate about how best to increase numbers ‚Äì whether to focus only on the purebreds or to employ selective crossbreeding to build greater numbers of Pottok-like ponies. Pottok are shown both at agricultural shows and town festivals: *Espelette (Labourd) on the last Tuesday and Wednesday in January *Markina-Xemein (Biscay) on the second Saturday in October at the Euskal Herriko Arrazen Erakusketa (\\"Basque Country Breeds' Show\\") *Zumarraga (Gipuzkoa) on the 13th of December at the Santa Lutzi Feria =Studbooks= In the Northern Basque Country, two studbooks for the Pottok were set up in 1970. Crossbreds, covered under Book B, must have at least 50% Pottok blood, while Book A covers those of higher purity.Association Nationale du Pottok, accessed August 2011 Horses in Book A are divided into two types, the Mountain Pottok and the Plains Pottok. Only horses which live for a minimum of nine months in the year in semi-feral conditions in a harem containing mares, foals and stallions in the mountainous areas of la Rhune, Ba√Øgorry, Ursuya and Artzamendi are considered Mountain Pottoks. The breed standard specifies: *robust, intelligent horse *short, forward-facing ears *short neck with a thick mane to the withers *broad chest, long back *short, sloping croup with a thick tail *small, hard hooves *height of at the withers for the Mountain Pottok, and for the Plains Pottok *coat in black, bay or brown or chestnut.

It is the 16th largest tram system in the world by route length, in 2017 providing 149.1 million journeys (up 9.5% on 2016) over routes 140.6 km in length.http://www.stib- mivb.be/irj/go/km/docs/WEBSITE_RES/Attachments/Corporate/Statistiques/2017/STIB_RA2017_Statistiques_FR_HDok.pdf In 2018, the Brussels tram system consisted of 18 tram lines (eight of which ‚Äì lines 3, 4, 7, 25, 32, 51, 55 and 82 ‚Äì qualified as pre metro lines, and five of which - lines 3, 4, 7, 8 and 9 - qualified as \\"Chrono\\" or \\"Fast\\" lines). Its development has demonstrated many of the quandaries that face local public transport planners. The Brussels tram system also has several interesting peculiarities: the inconsistent route pattern resulting from the closure of the interurban trams, the conflict between low-floor surface trams and high- floor underground trams, and whether the trams run on the right or the left. History A Brussels tram in 1937 =Before the First World War= Belgium's first horse-drawn trams were introduced in Brussels in 1869, running from the Porte de Namur to the Bois de la Cambre. In 1877 a steam tram was introduced but it was not powerful enough for the hilly terrain and the tests were stopped. Simultaneously the Tramways Bruxellois experimented with a locomotive built in Tubize but it did not work either. The components proved too fragile and this experiment was also discontinued. In 1887 experiments were made with accumulator trams, but these had a very limited range. Trolley power, used in Li√®ge, was also tried in Brussels and in 1894 Brussels's first electric tram lines were laid from Place St√©phanie/Stefanieplein to Uccle/Ukkel. Several companies built their own tram lines until the turn of the century, the most important being: * TB: Les Tramways Bruxellois: founded on 23 December 1874 on the merger of the Belgian Street Railways and Omnibus Company Limited led by Albert Vaucamp and the Soci√©t√© des Voies ferr√©es Belges led by William Morris (Morris & Sheldon Company). The TB started with five horse tramlines: ** Schaerbeek - Room Forest (Morris) ** Uccle ‚Äì Place Stephanie (Morris) ** Liedtsplaats - Sint-Gilles (Vaucamp) ** Laeken - South (Vaucamp) ** Laeken - Anderlecht (Vaucamp) * CFE: Les Chemins General de Fer Economiques‚Äô: known before 1880 as Compagnie G√©n√©rale de Tramways. The CFE electrified its lines from 1904 onwards. These lines had the Stock Exchange as the central hub. In addition, there were smaller companies: * Tramways de Bruxelles √† Evere et Extensions: founded in 1883 * Chemin de Fer √† Voie Etroite de Bruxelles in Ixelles-Boondael: founded in 1884, and taken over by the TB on 28 April 1899. These last two companies used metre-gauge track and started with steam traction instead of with horse trams. In 1899, the TB was granted a 45-year concession on condition that the whole network was electrified, a condition that was met in the following years. Until the First World War, many investments were made in the network, such as heavier rails and more powerful trams. The vicinal/buurtspoor networks set up city services. =After the First World War= Tram services were not restored to normality until 1925. During the war there was poor maintenance, many horses were requisitioned and tram equipment was used for military purposes. On 1 January 1928, the TB and CFE networks merged, leaving only the TB and the vicinal/buurtspoor network in operation. The CFE was known for its 'chocolate bars' so named because of their dark brown livery (several examples can still be admired in the Brussels tram museum). CFE personnel also wore brown uniforms. In 1928 the CFE lines were renumbered within the TB system. In 1935, the Brussels tram network was 240 kilometres long, making it one of the larger tram networks in Europe. There were almost 100 tram lines, including many direct connections between the various boroughs. For the World Exhibition of 1935, the famous '5000-series' trams, the first in Brussels with two bogies, were put into service. Because the TB concession expired on 31 December 1945, an agreement was concluded between the State and the Province of Brabant to continue the operation of the Brussels trams. A provisional management committee was set up, which functioned until the foundation, on 1 January 1954, of the Soci√©t√© des Transports Intercommunale de Bruxelles/Maatschappij voor de Intercommunaal Vervoer in Brussel (STIB/MIVB). Great efforts were made to catch up on overdue maintenance and 787 motor trams were modernised to the Brussels standard type. The electro-pneumatic brake was introduced in these cars and the conductor and driver (called Wattman in Belgium) had permanent seats. Growing traffic congestion led to plans to build reserved tracks for trams, and in the city centre to put them in tunnel. In 1957, the first tunnel was opened near the congested Constitution Square, between the South Station and Lemonnier. From 1969, trams were adapted to run in tunnel, using block signalling. In addition to the major refurbishment of the standard cars, STIB/MIVB had a great need for modern equipment to serve the World Exhibition in 1958 (Expo 58), to which its organisers wished to provide public transport access from all the city. To this end, large turning loops for hundreds of trams were laid out in the exhibition grounds. Between 1951 and 1953, the PCC car entered Brussels with motor car 7001, the start of a series of 172 cars. Over the years, many series of single-ended versions (7500 and 7700 series, 128 car) and double-ended versions (7900 series, 61 cars) followed. Eventually, the PCC car entirely replaced motor wagon and trailer combinations. The development of the premetro, a tram-unfriendly policy and a constant shortage of funds led to a deterioration of the Brussels tram system well into the 1990s, with many routes being replaced by metro lines or converted to bus routes. Only with investment in new equipment (the T2000 tram) and the upgrading and improvement of the tram network did the balance turn positive. Intermodal integration The system exists in a somewhat unusual local government context, because Brussels is a self-governing region, as an enclave within Flanders, although only some 3.3 kilometres from Wallonia at the closest point. This means that three-way deals are necessary between Brussels‚Äô own STIB/MIVB, Flanders‚Äô De Lijn and Wallonia's TEC. STIB sees itself as a provider of mobility rather than just public transport, and has a 49% share in the CambioCambio carsharing franchise. The Brussels conurbation ‚Äî 19 municipalities plus adjoining commuter belt ‚Äî is also served by a fairly dense network of main-line trains. The MOBIB contactless smart card can be used on buses, trams, the metro and for mainline railway season tickets, and is gradually being extended to other modes, although it is not yet accepted for single journeys by De Lijn. A simple tariff system permits unlimited changes with a one-hour period for ‚Ç¨2.50 when bought from the driver, ‚Ç¨2.10 from a ticket machine. Real-time arrival indicators have been installed at many tram stops. Ridership has been rising, and user-friendly features that have grown up through custom and practice help this. For instance, passengers open the doors by pressing a green strip on the central pole (in PCC trams) or an illuminated button (on Flexity trams), and drivers usually make a point of waiting for latecomers. However, overcrowding at rush hours and at weekend is common. The rate of detected fare-dodging is 4.15%,http://2016.stib-activityreports.brussels/en despite periodic enforcement campaigns, and this is being addressed by the installation of ticket barriers in all metro stations. From 2013, the obligation to check out of as well as into the system is being progressively introduced. Routes=Development of the network= A tram at Porte de Hal premetro station Platforms of Boileau premetro station, clearly showing the dual platform heights As of 2017, there are 17 tram routes, totalling , and serving most parts of the city, including three partial ring routes (7, 8, and 81). The routes have a very varied feel, including street running through narrow streets in working-class districts (line 81), cobbled central reservation, reserved track through parkland and woods (line 44), signal- controlled running in tunnels (the premetro lines 3 and 4 in the North‚ÄìSouth Axis, and 7), and short stretches in cutting (the old route 18, closed in 2007). Almost all trams are double-ended and all are double-sided, and while some stub termini remain (4, 51, 97), most have loops. The route pattern shows some notable gaps, particularly along major radial routes, because these were originally served by the national network of buurtspoorwegen/tramways vicinaux. These had a gauge of one metre, rather than the Brussels standard gauge, and so the tracks could not easily be taken over when the lines were progressively closed from the 1960s onwards. The complementary routing of vicinal and urban tracks and the replacement of key lines by metro has led to some peculiar track layouts, for instance at the Barri√®re de St-Gilles/Bareel St-Gillis. Though all seven roads at this circular junction originally had tram lines, only three of the original seven remain.Map from September 1949 by J.C. Gillham inside back cover of Brussels - A Tramway Reborn 1945-2008, Geoffrey Skelsey & Yves-Laurent Hansart, Light Rail Transit Association, Peterborough UK, 2008, To negotiate a sharp turn, the old route T18 (closed 1 July 2007) had to make a 270-degree turn on its journey away from the city centre, looping round and crossing its own path. Under the South station, the premetro and metro tracks swap from running on the right to running on the left where they run parallel to provide cross-platform interchange between the two lines. This serves no apparent purpose, but may be because main line trains in Belgium run on the left. Trams cross back to the right under Place Bara but the metro stays on the left as far as the Roi Baudouin terminus. By 2016, Bruxelles Mobilit√©/Brussel Mobiliteit had installed traffic light priority for trams or buses at 150 junctions.https://brussels.revues.org/1377?lang=en In some other places, the track layout is used to avoid hold-ups; for instance on route 92 at the Ma Campagne and Place Janson crossroads, which lie 300 metres from each other on the Chauss√©e de Charleroi/Charleroisesteenweg. There is lateral space for only one track in a raised central reservation, and the rails swerve to the left approximately 100 metres in front of the junction so that cars can queue in the right-hand lane. Between 2006 and 2009, a phased transformation of the network took place, with the aim of improving regularity and relieving overcrowding. The premetro service between North station and Albert was restructured with fewer lines passing through it, but at more regular intervals. These routes use the new longer Bombardier trams. The major part of the North-South Axis (from Lemonnier to Rogier) is now used only by lines 3 and 4 during the day, branded Chrono. Tram line 55 from Schaerbeek (north of Brussels) that used to use the North-South Axis now terminates at Rogier. The old line 52 was replaced by line 3 in the north (from Brussels-South railway station to Thomas and from Van Praet to Esplanade), 82 (from Drogenbos to Lemonnier) and 32 in the south. The old tram line 56 was also withdrawn. A previously implemented part of the plan was the creation of line 25 in April 2007. Line 25 goes from Rogier to the Boondael/Boondaal railway station following the route of the former line 90 from Rogier to Buyl, then leaves the outer ring towards the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles campus of Solbosch. On March 14, 2011, old lines 23 and 24 were merged to create the new eastern semicircular premetro line 7 which runs almost entirely in its own right of way from Heizel/Heysel in the north to Vanderkindere in the south. =Current routes= Tram routes : *3: Esplanade ‚Äî Churchill *4: Gare du Nord / Noordstation ‚Äî Stalle Parking *7: Heysel / Heizel ‚Äî Vanderkindere *8: Louise / Louiza ‚Äî Roodebeek *9: Simonis ‚Äî Arbre Ballon / Dikke Beuk *19: De Wand ‚Äî Groot-Bijgaarden *25: Rogier ‚Äî Boondael railway station *32: Da Vinci ‚Äî Drogenbos Ch√¢teau / Drogenbos Kasteel Only in the evening. *39: Montgomery ‚Äî Ban Eik *44: Montgomery ‚Äî Tervuren Station *51: Stade / Stadion ‚Äî Van Haelen *55: Da Vinci ‚Äî Rogier *62: Eurocontrol ‚Äî Cimeti√®re de Jette / Kerkhof van Jette *81: Marius Renard ‚Äî Montgomery *82: Berchem Station ‚Äî Drogenbos Ch√¢teau / Drogenbos Kasteel *92: Schaerbeek Gare / Schaarbeek Station ‚Äî Fort Jaco *93: Stade / Stadion ‚Äî Legrand *97: Louise / Louiza ‚Äî Dieweg Stricken-out numbers represent partial services (they do not go up to the end of the line).

Lines 3, 7 and 9 are to be connected at the Heysel/Heizel, and on 20 December 2018, Brussels Mobility Minister Pascale Smet announcedhttps://www.lalibre.be/regions/bruxelles/deux- nouvelles-lignes-de-tram-prochainement-a-bruxelles-5c1cb46ecd70fdc91c18ea04 that the next two lines to be built, estimated to open in 2024, will run: * from Place Rogier/Rogierplein to Belgica via Nord/Noord and Tour et Taxis/Thurn en Taxis (seat of the Flemish regional government) * from Place Rogier/Rogierplein to H√¥pital Militaire/Militaire Ziekenhuis in Neder-Over- Heembeek via Van Praet The Flemish region, under its Brabantnet plan, intends to build a new line to the north of the city, from Heysel/Heizel to Willebroek alongside the A12 road.http://www.bruzz.be/nl/nieuws/groen-licht-voor-trams- naar-luchthaven-en-willebroek Its success will require integration with the existing Brussels regional system; for instance the line will have to be built at standard rather than metre gauge (as the other Flemish trams are). Three other suburban/interurban lines had been proposed: * from Brussels westwards to Ninove * from Brussels north-eastwards to Heist-op-den-Berg * from Heizel/Heysel via Vilvoorde to Zaventem airport The first two proposals were withdrawn, while the last has been implemented in 2020 as a 'tram- bus'.https://www.delijn.be/nl/mobiliteitsvisie2020/brabantnet/wat-is- brabantnet/jette-airport.html. The Ringtrambus (route 820) from Brussels Airport to Jette opened on 28 June 2020, operated by 14 24-metre double- articulated buses.

During 2014 and 2015 STIB/MIVB promoted a project to 'tramify' the Porte de Namur/Naamsepoort to Delta section of the overloaded 71 bus route, which carries over 12,000 passengers per day in each direction.https://www.thebulletin.be/tram-71-plan-scrapped-brussels-unveils- new-transport-map The Brussels region supported the proposal, but the municipality of Ixelles/Elsene was against, supported by traders on the Chauss√©e d√çxelles/Elsensesteenweg who feared the disruption the tracklaying would cause. The proposal was dropped and instead the section from the Chauss√©e de Wavre/Waversesteenweg to Place Fernand Coq/Fernand Coqplein has been made largely car- free.http://www.bruxellesespacespublics.irisnet.be/places-et-voiries/chaussee- dixelles-reamenagement-de-lespace-public/ Other outline proposals have been made to: * extend the 62 to Zaventem airport (with the infrastructure being paid for by the Flemish Region) * divert the 92 from Rue Royale/Koningsstraat to serve Central Station * rebuild the east‚Äìwest link through the city centre from Bourse/Beurs to Place Royale/Koningsplein On 18 July 2019 the Brussels government, in its programme for the period 2019‚Äì2024,http://www.parlement.brussels/wp- content/uploads/2019/07/07-20-D%C3%A9claration-gouvernementale-parlement- bruxellois-2019.pdf D√©claration de politique g√©n√©rale commune au Gouvernement de la R√©gion de Bruxelles-Capitale et au Coll√®ge r√©uni de la Commission communautaire commune. L√©gislature 2019-2024, pp. 75-76 committed itself to set the following additional developments in train:Tram 2000 August 2019, p. 38 * conversion of bus route 95 from Central Station to the university area (partially making up for the failed conversion of route 71) * extension of route 25 eastwards to serve the Mediapark * extension of route 7 westwards to Forest (this may include a tunnel under the Parc de Forest/Park van Vorst from Albert, where lines 4, 7 and 51 will terminate when the heavy metro is extended to Albert) and conversion of bus route 49 to form a western ring line * extension of route 8 northwards to Evere and eastwards to Jesus-Eik =Track maintenance= Temporary or 'Californian' points installed on line 81 at junction of Avenue Louise and Rue Bailli, Brussels, on 11 July 2018Relaying route 81, 92 and 97 tram tracks on top of a concrete raft, 'Janson', Brussels, 25 July 2015Track is renewed periodically, both when it wears out, and also to increase the lateral clearance between tracks, to enable the safe passage of wider trams. Minor imperfections are smoothed by in-situ welding. When a temporary diversion is required, STIB/MIVB often installs a set of temporary or 'Californian' points which sits on top of the permanent rails. Track has historically been embedded in stone setts, with STIB/MTUB taking responsibility for the road up to 30 cm on either side of the rails. However recently tarmac has been used, which improves conditions for cyclists. In recent years when major junctions have been relaid, the opportunuity has been taken to increase stability by installing a concrete raft underneath the whole junction. =Signalling= On the overground parts of the network trams drive at sight, while the underground premetro sections have block signalling. However drivers do not need to check in and out of the signalled section as on the Muni system in San Francisco. An exception is in the earliest tunnel to be built, at the Lemonnier stop, where passengers cross the tracks using an underground level crossing. This station will be bypassed when the line is converted to heavy metro and the new Constitution station built slightly to its east. Vehicles=Fleet= As of 18 September 2017, the fleet consists of 396 trams, of the following types:Tram 2000 November 2017, p. 10 * 64 7700-series 2-section PCCs (20m) * 61 7900-series 3-section PCCs (27m) * 51 2000-series 3-section purpose-built Bombardier T2000s * 150 3000-series 5-section Flexity Outlook Cityrunners (30m) * 70 4000-series 7-section Flexities (41m) As of 18 June 2019, 90 new sets of Flexities are on order.Bombardier to supply 30 more next-generation Flexity trams to Brussels, accessed 2019-07-16. =High-floor and low-floor= A 4000 series tram at Heysel The development of the system is being pulled in two contradictory directions ‚Äì towards low-floor street-running trams and high-floor underground railway. This has led to some conflicting decisions. The standard trams ‚Äî still \\"PCC's from the 1950s and 60s ‚Äî have been followed by the specially designed \\"T2000\\" low-floor model and, at the end of 2005, by a variant of the off-the-shelf \\"Flexity Outlook\\" from Bombardier (3000 series), and, at the end of 2006, by an even longer version of the same family (4000 series). On some of the busiest routes, the convenience of the low floor is lost because of the anomalies caused by the hesitant upgrade of tram to metro. The city has four heavy metro lines and three stretches of premetro or underground tram. The premetro tunnels have been built to allow for eventual upgrade to heavy metro, so most of the platform is high, and is connected to the street (at least in the upward direction) by escalator. At some stations lifts have been installed, but there is a cutout section taking the level down to one foot above ground to board the trams. The three steps this entails make life difficult for passengers with baby buggies or suitcases, even though the new low-floor trams are accessible to wheel-chair users. To get around this last barrier to mobility, an experimental ramp was installed in 2009 at Parvis de St-Gilles/St-Gillis Voorplein. A PCC leaving Place Rogier/Rogierplein for South/Midi station, before the opening of the north‚Äìsouth premetro. The tram stop in the background was also used by the Vicinal, which had its terminal loop here. =Coupled sets= Coupled PCC trams on test, Place Van Meenen, Brussels, 18 September 2018Coupled sets are not currently used, although since c. 2015 tests have been made of pairs of PCCs connected by a towbar. =Livery= A PCC tram in art nouveau livery Brussels trams have known several liveries. In the beginning of the 20th century, those operated by the Tramways Bruxellois were dark green, and those by the Chemins de Fer Economiques were chocolate. The two companies merged in the 1920s, whereupon a standard livery of primrose yellow was adopted which lasted (with some minor changes in the trimmings) until the mid-1990s when a brighter shade of yellow was adopted. A profound change in livery came in 2006 with the adoption of the so-called art nouveau livery of silver and light brown on the new 3000 and 4000 vehicles. The rest of the active fleet has been repainted. =Heritage trams= The system exists in happy symbiosis with an active heritage operation based at Woluwe depot, and privately hired trams have free access to the tracks. Trams that still collect their current through trolley poles rather than pantographs are normally restricted to the scenic line from Cinquantenaire park via Woluwe to Tervuren, which is run with the help of volunteers from the preservation society MTUB (Museum of Brussels Urban Transport), whose board has a strong representation from STIB/MIVB. This runs at weekends from April to October; occasionally, such as on the Belgian national holiday, 21 July, these trams appear in the city centre, where the line in the Koningsstraat/Rue Royale is trolleypole-enabled. Several trams have been sent to the United States. Tram 7037 is in San Francisco operating on the F-Line, surreally repainted in the blue-and-white livery of Z√ºrich. Tram 1504 is at the Trolley Museum of New York and 1511 is at Old Pueblo Trolley. A 4-axle PCC is also awaiting restoration at the Ontario St shed of Vancouver's Downtown Historic Railway. =Special-purpose trams= Car 7126, BX1 programme Le Tram mobile studio, at Place Louise, 5 April 2017One PCC tram was converted in 2012 into a mobile restaurant, which operates six evenings per week.https://visit.brussels/en/sites/tramexperience/ Its fleet number is 7601, formerly 7765 and before that 7565. A second PCC tram, 7126, serves as a mobile studio for the Le Tram television programme broadcast by BX1 (formerly T√©l√© Bruxelles) every other Sunday, during which an interview is conducted while the tram tours Brussels.http://bx1.be/emissions/le-tram/ The tram tows a generator trailer. =2010 Vancouver Olympics= Brussels trams on loan to Vancouver for demonstration during 2010 Winter Olympics From January 21 to March 21, 2010, a demonstration streetcar project, known as the Olympic Line, at Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, used cars 3050 & 3051 (Bombardier Flexity Outlook) on a Vancouver Downtown Historic Railway 1.8 km track.

The lesser known First Battle of Rivas took place on the 29 June 1855 between Walker's forces and the forces of the Chamorro government of Nicaragua. Background New York would enter the San Juan River from the Atlantic and sail across Lake Nicaragua. People and goods would then be transported by stagecoach over a narrow strip of land near the city of Rivas, before reaching the Pacific At the time, a major trade route between New York City and San Francisco ran through southern Nicaragua. Ships from New York would enter the San Juan River from the Atlantic and sail across Lake Nicaragua. People and goods would then be transported by stagecoach over a narrow strip of land near the city of Rivas, before reaching the Pacific and being shipped to San Francisco. The commercial exploitation of this route had been attained from a previous Nicaraguan administration to Wall Street tycoon Cornelius Vanderbilt's Accessory Transit Company. Garrison and Morgan had wrested control of the company from Vanderbilt and then supported Walker's expedition. Vanderbilt spread rumors that the company was issuing stock illegally in order to depress its value, allowing him to regain controlling interest. In July 1856, Walker set himself up as president of Nicaragua, after conducting a farcical election. As ruler of Nicaragua, Walker then revoked the Transit Company's charter, claiming that it had violated the agreement, and granted use of the route back to Garrison and Morgan. Outraged, Vanderbilt successfully pressured the U.S. government to withdraw its recognition of Walker's regime. Walker had also scared his neighbors and American and European investors with talk of further military conquests in Central America. Vanderbilt financed and trained a military coalition of these states, led by Costa Rica, and worked to prevent men and supplies from reaching Walker. He also provided defectors from Walker's army with payments and free passage back to the U.S. Realising that his position was becoming precarious, he sought support from the Southerners in the U.S. by recasting his campaign as a fight to spread the institution of black slavery, which many American Southern businessmen saw as the basis of their agrarian economy. With this in mind, Walker revoked Nicaragua's emancipation edict of 1824. This move did increase Walker's popularity in the South and attracted the attention of Pierre Soul√©, an influential New Orleans politician, who campaigned to raise support for Walker's war. Nevertheless, Walker's army, thinned by an epidemic of cholera and massive defections, was no match for the Central American Coalition and Vanderbilt's agents. Costa Rican President Juan Rafael Mora watched with concern as Walker consolidated his forces and power in Nicaragua. Fearing that Walker would become unbeatable and at the urging and backing of Vanderbilt's business empire Mora declared war, not on Nicaragua, but on Walker and his filibusters, on the 1 March 1856. Having been talking about the filibusters for a while, Mora made this declaration in a famous speech that begins with the words, \\"Countrymen, take your weapons, the time that I've been warning you has arrived\\" (a paraphrase of the opening words of the Marseillaise). Enraged Walker ordered the invasion of Costa Rica and a filibuster force crossed the border into Guanacaste, while the Costa Rican army moved down from the Central Valley in the same direction. With the army traveled the President but command was in the hands of his brother, Jose Joaquin Mora, and his brother-in-law, General Ca√±as. Upon hearing that a small contingent of men were encamped near the city of Guanacaste's Hacienda Santa Rosa Mora led three thousand of his men to attack. Walker's men were under the command of Colonel Louis Schlessinger, an inexperienced officer. On the 20 March with no sentries posted, Mora's Costa Ricans surprised and attacked the small group; Schlessinger himself ran away, leaving his troops vulnerable, disorganised, and without leadership. Walker alarmed by the defeat heard unfounded rumors that Mora's army was going to attack from the North. So he foolishly decided to abandon the key city of the Nicaragua at that time and meet the army from the north. Mora quickly slipped into Rivas with 3,000 men. Battle Walker, just four days after giving up the city, marched his men back into Rivas to try to take it back. His small force was able to score a number of victories through street to street fighting and were able to create a stalemate at a key building in town, El Mes√≥n de Guerra, the Guerra family home, which was located in the corner of the park, covered the approach to Rivas church; from the towers of the church Walker's snipers enjoyed a wide firing range. =Juan Santamar√≠a= According to the traditional account, on April 11, Salvadoran General Jos√© Mar√≠a Ca√±as suggested that one of the soldiers advance towards the hostel with a torch and set it on fire. Some soldiers tried and failed, but Santamar√≠a finally volunteered on the condition that in the event of his death, someone would look after his mother. He then advanced and was mortally wounded by enemy fire. Before expiring he succeeded, however, in setting fire to the hostel, thus contributing decisively to the Costa Rican victory at Rivas, as the enemy then retreated. Fern√°ndez Guardia, Ricardo. \\"JUAN SANTAMAR√çA Y EL INCENDIO DEL MES√ìN DE GUERRA\\" (in Spanish). Archived from the original on 10 June 2007 =Francisca (\\"Pancha\\") Carrasco= Carrasco who was serving the militia as a cook and impromptu medic, filled her apron pockets with bullets, grabbed a discarded rifle and shamed some of the retreating Costa Ricans forestalling what might have become a rout. =Juan Alfaro Ruiz= Juan Alfaro Ruiz was responsible for clearing the filibusters from the church. He died of cholera after the battle. One of Alajuela's cantons was named after him. Aftermath Walker and his surviving soldiers fled to Granada during the night. Several factions inside the Costa Rican Army sought to pursue and kill Walker, thus ending the war. President Mora cancelled the plan, seeing his troops were already battle-worn. Mora wanted to use his resources to bury the dead and take care of the wounded and sick. Although Costa Rica was victorious in the Battle of Rivas, the country could not enjoy the victory. Bodies from the fighting were dumped in the wells of the city causing a huge outbreak of cholera. Thinking the cholera was brought by the hot weather of the Nicaraguan lowlands, the troops wanted to go back home. The Costa Rican troops brought the disease home to Costa Rica with them where it ravaged the entire country, killing one tenth of the population. Mora was blamed for the cholera outbreak, the severe losses inflicted to the army and for the economic damage to the country because of the war debts. A coup was planned for his return to the capital but this was aborted. The war against Walker would continue, joined now by the armies of other Central American countries under the overall command of General Mora, focused on cutting the men and weapons flow to the filibusters cutting the transit route. After the war, Mora was removed from power in 1859 and executed in 1860 when he tried to come back to power along General Ca√±as. ReferencesBibliography McCloskey, J. J.

Prior to his career as a professional mountain biker Peat was employed as a plumber by James Lamb. He is married to Adele Croxon and has two sons, Jake and George Peat. Peat began his career with little success riding for the Saracen team alongside Rob Warner, before moving in the mid 1990s to Team MBUK. He rode for GT Bicycles in the late 1990s and for the Orange team between 2002 and 2005, winning the Fort William downhill world cup round in 2005. He then joined the Santa Cruz Syndicate team for the 2006 season, which saw him finish 1st overall. He continues to race for Santa Cruz Syndicate. As last man down the hill, Peat won the La Bresse downhill world cup round 2 on 10 May 2009 with a time of 02:07.14 knocking Sam Hill out of the hot seat for his 16th world cup round win, tying at the top of the all-time leader-board with Nicolas Vouilloz. Just one week later on 17 May 2009, at the third round of the UCI World Cup in Vallnord, Peat won again (besting compatriot Gee Atherton by just 0.02 seconds) making him the most successful male downhill mountain bike racer ever by number of wins at the time. This record has since been beaten Peat's South African teammate, Greg Minnaar. Other successes include placing second in the Mountain Bike World Championships in 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2008. On 6 September 2009, Peat won the World Championships in Canberra for the first time in his career, with a winning time of 2:30.33, just 0.05 seconds ahead of his Santa Cruz team mate Greg Minnaar. He was crowned World Cup champion in 2002, 2004 and 2006. He has also won the Lisboa Downhill, held in Lisbon, Portugal, eight times. Aside from his professional riding career, Peat has other involvements with the sport, including contributing to the design and manufacture of specialist riding clothing made by Royal Racing of which he is part owner. Peat also has involvements with young cyclist academies, and is a proponent of youth involvement in the sport. Following his recent world champ status he has released his own game 'Steve Peat - Downhill Mountain Biking' for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch.

Calloway, who the prosecution argued was trying to commit suicide. Calloway, a Federal Express employee, was facing possible dismissal for lying about his flight hours. He boarded the scheduled flight as a deadhead passenger carrying a guitar case concealing several hammers and a speargun. He intended to switch off the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder before takeoff and, once airborne, kill the crew with hammers so their injuries would appear consistent with an accident rather than a hijacking. However, the CVR was switched back on by the flight engineer, believing that he had neglected to turn it on. Calloway intended to use the speargun as a last resort. He planned to crash the aircraft hoping that he would appear to be an employee killed in an accident. He sought to let his family collect on a $2.5 million life insurance policy provided by Federal Express. Calloway's efforts to kill the crew were unsuccessful. Despite severe injuries, the crew fought back, subdued Calloway, and landed the aircraft safely. During his trial, Calloway attempted to invoke an insanity defense, but was convicted of multiple charges, including attempted murder, attempted air piracy, and interference with flight crew operations. He received two consecutive life sentences. Calloway successfully appealed the conviction for interference, which was ruled to be a lesser offense of attempted air piracy.  Flight crew and hijacker  Three flight crew members were in the cockpit on this particular flight: 49-year-old Captain David Sanders; 42-year-old first officer Jim Tucker; and 39-year-old flight engineer Andrew Peterson. Also in the airplane was 42-year-old FedEx flight engineer Auburn Calloway, an alumnus of Stanford University and a former Navy pilot and martial arts expert, who was facing possible dismissal over falsifying of flight hours. In order to disguise the hijacking as an accident, so his family would benefit from his US$2.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) life insurance policy, Calloway intended to murder the flight crew using blunt force. To accomplish this, he brought on board two claw hammers, two club hammers, a speargun, and a knife (which was not used) concealed inside a guitar case. He also carried with him a note written to his ex-wife and \\"describing the author's apparent despair\\". Just before the flight, Calloway had transferred over US$54,000 () in securities and cashier's checks to his ex-wife.  Flight details  Before takeoff, as part of his plan to disguise the intended attack as an accident, Calloway attempted to disable the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) by pulling its circuit breaker to interrupt CVR power. During the standard pre-flight checks, flight engineer Peterson noticed the pulled breaker and reset it before takeoff so the CVR was reactivated. However, if Calloway killed the crew members with the CVR still on, he would simply have had to fly for 30 minutes to erase any trace of a struggle from the CVR's 30-minute loop. About twenty minutes after takeoff, as the flight crew carried on a casual conversation, Calloway went into the back to get his weapons and entered the flight deck and commenced his attack. All three members of the crew received multiple hammer blows. Both Peterson and first officer Tucker suffered fractured skulls, and Peterson's temporal artery was severed. The blow to Tucker's head initially rendered him unable to move or react but he was still conscious. Captain Sanders reported that during the beginning of the attack, he could not discern any emotion from Calloway, just \\"simply a face in his eyes\\". When Calloway ceased his hammer attack, Peterson and Sanders began to get out of their seats to counter-attack. Calloway left the cockpit and retrieved his spear gun. He came back into the cockpit and threatened everyone to sit back down in their seats. Despite loud ringing in his ear and being dazed, Peterson grabbed the gun by the spear between the barbs and the barrel. A lengthy struggle ensued, while Tucker, also an ex-Navy pilot, performed extreme aerial maneuvers with the aircraft. He pulled the plane into a sudden 15-degree climb, throwing Sanders, Peterson and Calloway out of the cockpit and into the galley. To try to throw Calloway off balance, Tucker then turned the plane into a left roll, almost on its side. This rolled the combatants along the smoke curtain onto the left side of the galley. Eventually, Tucker had rolled the plane almost upside down at 140 degrees, while attempting to maintain a visual reference of the environment around him through the windows. Peterson, Sanders and Calloway were then pinned to the ceiling of the plane. Calloway managed to wrench his hammer hand free and hit Sanders in the head again. Just then, Tucker put the plane into a steep dive. This pushed the combatants back to the seat curtain, but the wings and elevators started to flutter. At this point Tucker could hear the wind rushing against the cockpit windows. At , the plane's elevators fluttered so much that the control surfaces became unresponsive due to the disrupted airflow. This tested the aircraft‚Äôs safety limits. Tucker realized this was because the throttles were at full power. Releasing his only usable hand to pull back the throttles to idle, he managed to pull the plane out of the dive while it slowed down. Calloway managed to hit Sanders again while the struggle continued. Sanders was losing strength and Peterson was heavily bleeding from a ruptured artery. In spite of his diminishing strength, Sanders managed to grab the hammer out of Calloway's hand and attacked him with it. When the plane was completely level, Tucker reported to Memphis Center, informed them about the attack and requested a vector back to Memphis. He requested an ambulance and \\"armed intervention\\", meaning he wanted SWAT to storm the plane. The flight crew eventually succeeded in restraining Calloway, although only after moments of inverted and near-supersonic flight beyond the designed capabilities of a DC-10. Sanders took control and Tucker, who had by then lost use of the right side of his body, went back to assist Peterson in restraining Calloway. Sanders communicated with air traffic control, preparing for an emergency landing back at Memphis International Airport. Meanwhile, Calloway started fighting with the crew again. Heavily loaded with fuel and cargo, the plane was approaching too fast and too high to land on the scheduled runway 9. A fully loaded airliner could break up upon landing at these conditions. Sanders requested by radio to land on the longer runway 36L. Ignoring warning messages from the onboard computer and using a series of sharp turns that tested the DC-10's safety limits, Sanders landed the jet safely on the runway at over its maximum designed landing weight. By that time, Calloway was once again restrained. Emergency personnel and police gained access to the plane via escape slide and ladder. Inside, they found the interior of the galley and cockpit covered in blood. Calloway was then arrested and taken off the plane.  Aftermath  The crew of Flight 705 sustained serious injuries. The left side of Tucker's skull was severely fractured, causing motor control problems in his right arm and right leg.

Sanders suffered several deep gashes in his head and doctors had to sew his right ear back in place. Flight engineer Peterson's skull was fractured and his temporal artery severed. The aircraft itself incurred damages in the amount of $800,000. Calloway pleaded temporary insanity but was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences (federal sentences are not subject to parole) on August 11, 1995, for attempted murder and attempted air piracy.

The term stage mother sometimes has a negative connotation, suggesting that the individual is prone to obnoxiously demanding special treatment for her child, or suggesting that the individual has placed inappropriate pressure on her child to succeed, perhaps for reasons of vicariously living out her own dreams through the child. Entitled and grandiose demands have sometimes led to reportedly veiled threats from a stage parent. Definition A stage mother may also be the official manager of her child (e.g., Rose Thompson Hovick, Dina Lohan, Ethel Gumm, Teri Shields, Susan Duff, etc.)‚Äîrepresenting her child in negotiations for the professional services of her child. Such managers have often been referred to as \\"momagers\\" in the film industry. In certain cases where a mother and child both work in the film industry, an automatic labeling of \\"stage mother\\" can be affixed to the mother without cause. Kathie Lee Gifford has been against the concept of stage mothers and had explained that when her son Cody co-starred with her in the film Model Behavior, it had been on his own volition to try acting and not at her insistence. Gifford plays a stage mother in that movie. Notable stage mothersStage fathers Fathers have also been known to manage their children in this way, such as Joseph Jackson (patriarch of the Jackson family), Murry Wilson (father of three of The Beach Boys), Joe Simpson (father of Jessica and Ashlee Simpson), Jeff Archuleta (father of American Idol runner-up David Archuleta), Mathew Knowles (father of Beyonc√© and Solange Knowles) and Kit Culkin (father of Macaulay and Kieran Culkin). A historical example of such a father was Leopold Mozart, who recognized his son's musical ability at an early age and made the most of it. Abraham Quintanilla, Jr., father of Tejano superstar Selena, is credited with having discovered Selena's gift of singing; he rounded up her and her siblings as a band (Selena y Los Dinos), named for his band in his younger days. Stage fathers share a similar role with parents promoting their children in professional sports. The drive to enhance their child's success, and vicariously the father's own financial furtherance and fame can include implementation of strength and exercise regimens at a young age and backhanded actions such as delaying enrollment in school so their sons will be bigger than their classmates.\\"Was it Guys Like These who Ruined Sportsmanship....or was it Just Us?\\" Sports Illustrated Sept. 30th, 1991 Lavar Ball, father of NBA player Lonzo Ball, achieved notoriety for spurious self aggrandizement and inflation of his son's assets, including questionable claims that his son's basketball skills exceeded those of Stephen Curry, LeBron James and Russell Westbrook.  Script mother  A variant of the term has been a \\"script mother\\", or a woman writer who sees her children as a means for writing books or screenplays based on humiliating events in the child's life, to the detriment of the child, or exaggerating a child's personal problems. Script mothers can be writers, comedians or cartoonists. An example of a script mother has been Lynn Johnston, who has been criticized for exploiting her children (and husband) in her comic strip For Better or for Worse, as opposed to many cartoonists such as Charles Schultz and Berke Breathed who make up fictional characters. Johnston's children eventually had to be pulled out of school due to the constant bullying and embarrassment they received in being compared to their comic strip counterparts, and placed into a private school with tougher regulations on student conduct.Aaron Johnston \\"Kate and I were constantly bullied due to the strip\\" Suddenly Silver, 25 Years of FBOFW, 2003 In popular culture *The hugely successful and popular musical Gypsy is the story of Rose, a domineering stage mother of her children, June and Louise who go on to become June Havoc and Gypsy Rose Lee respectively. *Stage Mother is a 1933 film about a frustrated vaudeville performer who pushes her daughter into becoming a dancer. *The 1982 biopic Frances stars Jessica Lange as American actress Frances Farmer, whose mother, Lillian Van Ornum (Kim Stanley) pushed her into an entertainment career after her own acting ambitions were thwarted. *Bellissima by Luchino Visconti is about a stage mother in Cinecitt√†, Rome, starring Anna Magnani. *An episode of the television show Kate & Allie was titled \\"Stage Mother\\".

He is the manager of the New York City-based band The Strokes.\\"The Strokes writing 'Thin Lizzy and Elvis Costello-inspired' album\\" NME 30 March 2009.  Biography  Gentles began his career in the music industry as a musician; he was the vocalist and guitarist in the band Timmsie's First Time which broke up in 1995 and then The Selzers, which broke up in 2000. Matthew Romano, The Strokes' drum technician and back-up drummer, was also in both bands, playing drums. While in school, Gentles interned for future Strokes publicist Jim Merlis at Geffen Records and New York music venue Mercury Lounge. After graduating in 1999, he was hired by Mercury Lounge and shortly became their booker. He soon came in contact with The Strokes who asked him \\"three or four times to manage them\\" despite the fact that professional managers were courting the band. He became their manager in 2000 and, at the insistence of frontman Julian Casablancas, had an equal share in the profits of the band, untypical of the music industry. Gentles was contracted to be The Strokes exclusive manager for five years and has continued to manage them. He played a starring role in their music video \\"The End Has No End\\". He is now often considered to be \\"the sixth Stroke\\". Gentles played guitar on one track of Strokes-guitarist Albert Hammond, Jr.'s 2006 album, titled Yours to Keep.

Along with the National Institute of Japanese Literature, the National Museum of Japanese History, and the National Museum of Ethnology, it is one of the National Institutes for the Humanities. The center is devoted to research related to Japanese culture. History The official origins of the institute are traced to an early study carried out by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, and Culture in 1982 on \\"methods of comprehensive research on Japanese culture\\". After surveying the field of Japanese studies for several years, the ministry, under the administration of Prime Minister Nakasone Yasuhiro, established the International Research Center for Japanese Studies in 1987 in Kyoto with the prominent philosopher Umehara Takeshi as its first Director-General. Prominent Kyoto academics Umesao Nobuo and Kuwabara Takeo also played key roles in the founding of the center. In 1990 the center moved to its current site in Oeyama-ch≈ç, Nishiky≈ç- ku. In 1995 Kawai Hayao, a Jungian analyst of Japanese psychology and religion, was inaugurated as the second director-general of Nichibunken. In 2001, Yamaori Tetsuo, professor of Japanese religion and folklore, became the center's third director-general. The current director-general, Katakura Motoko, was inaugurated in 2005. She is Nichibunken's first female director- general and, as a cultural-anthropologist who specializes in Middle-Eastern Studies, she is also the center's first director-general who is not a Japan specialist. Criticisms Nichibunken was established against the backdrop of an increasing trade surplus with the United States in the 1980s. One of the ostensible impulses behind the founding of the center was a desire to change overseas perceptions of Japan that viewed the country as a faceless economic power. The cultural-anthropologist Ueno Chizuko sharply criticized the center as a calculated attempt at national branding. Ueno claimed that, despite the center's academic pretensions, the real purpose of Nichibunken was to improve the image of Japan in order to prevent criticism of Japanese trading practices and improve sales of Japanese goods abroad. Ian Buruma caused considerable outrage at the time for arguing in influential newspapers abroad that the establishment of the Center was part of a project designed to revamp the kind of nationalist ideology current in pre-war Japan. The center has also been criticized for promoting theories of Japanese particularism. The appointment of Katakura Motoko as Nichibunken's fourth director-general may be seen as an attempt by the center to revamp its conservative image and distance itself from associations with theories of Japanese particularism. Katakura, a specialist in the anthropology of the Middle-East, is a relative outsider to the field of Japanese studies. The Nichibunken Library A library of Japanese Studies is attached to the center. The collection primarily consists of books and bibliographic materials pertinent to the academic study of Japan. As of 2014, the library contains approximately 400,000 volumes of books in Japanese and 97,000 volumes in other languages. It also houses approximately 4,400 Japanese periodicals and about 1,000 foreign language periodicals. The library has also a significant storage of media materials in form of records, video and other digital forms. Publications Nichibunken publishes two periodicals in the field of Japanese studies: Japan Review in English and Nihon Kenky≈´ (in Japanese). Japan Review is a peer-reviewed journal available on JSTOR and on the Nichibunken website. Japan Review, which is published annually, accepts outstanding essays on Japanese culture from scholars across the globe, as well as research notes. It carries reviews of important books on Japanese studies. Japan Review also publishes Special Issues, the first of which was published in 2013 as \\"Shunga: Sex and Humor in Japanese Art and Literature.\\" The bi-annual Nihon Kenky≈´ is also peer reviewed and invites contributions from scholars everywhere.

The design was the first of the new Enviro range of buses from TransBus and also the first bus to be built as an integral bus by TransBus. The Enviro300 was introduced in order to fill a gap in the manufacturer's product range. At the beginning the Cummins ISBe220 5.9-litre Euro III engine was provided as standard, but for Euro IV and V, the engine was the 6.7-litre ISBe with 225 hp for Euro IV and 225 or 250 hp for Euro V. There was a choice of 3 gearboxes: ZF Ecomat (originally 5HP502C, then 6HP504C), Allison T280R and Voith DIWA 854.5 (originally DIWA854.3E). The second generation Enviro300, with front end redesigned to match the Enviro200 and Enviro400, was launched in 2007.

The bus was developed to compete with the European-built heavy-weight single- decker buses sold in the United Kingdom, the most notable being Volvo. Many full-size (12m or more) single-decker buses are primarily designed for use on the continent and to carry a large number of standing passengers which is commonplace on the continent, but the Enviro300 was designed solely for the UK market where large numbers of standing passengers are not often carried. TransBus therefore believed that operators could make significant fuel savings by operating light-weight buses and produced a vehicle which is claimed to be lighter than its continental rivals but offer more seating capacity. The Enviro300 had not sold as well as the manufacturer had hoped, though sales were not helped by the collapse of TransBus International in 2004.

It can be an application of the lex talionis (‚Äúan eye for an eye‚Äù), but is not always proportional justice, as a similar method may be used to produce a worse or milder effect than the crime it \\"retaliates\\". The simplest method of mirror punishment is to enact the same action upon the criminal as the criminal perpetrated upon the victim. For example, thieves have the same amount of money taken from them as they stole, one who strikes another is struck in the same way, one who willfully causes another person's death is killed, and so on. Often, however, a more esoteric method of mirror punishment is used, which implies punishing the part of the criminal's body used to commit the crime. Extreme examples include the amputation of the hands of a thief, as still permitted by Sharia law, or during the Middle Ages in Europe, or disabling the foot or leg of a runaway slave. thumb When the Halifax Gibbet was used as a method of execution, if the offender was to be executed for stealing an animal, a cord was fastened to the pin and tied to either the stolen animal or one of the same species, which was then driven off, withdrawing the pin and allowing the blade to drop. Other examples include the punishment of adulterous women by the insertion of irritating substances into their vaginas (in the past hot pokers were sometimes used). A less extreme example is putting soap into a child's mouth for using inappropriate language (referred to in English as \\"washing out the mouth with soap\\"). Another method to accomplish \\"poetic justice\\" is to mirror the physical method of the crime, e.g., executing a murderer with his own weapon, burning arsonists alive, or in a more far-fetched example, boiling a counterfeiter alive (because bullion is boiled to be minted). Popular culture W. S. Gilbert's comic opera The Mikado contains a song satirizing mirror punishment: :The billiard-sharp who anyone catches :His doom‚Äôs extremely hard‚Äî :He‚Äôs made to dwell :In a dungeon cell :On a spot that‚Äôs always barred. :And there he plays extravagant matches :In fitless finger-stalls, :On a cloth untrue :With a twisted cue :And elliptical billiard balls. The refrain line \\"to let the punishment fit the crime\\" has sometimes been quoted in the course of British political debates, though the concept predates Gilbert.Green, Edward. \\"Ballads,songs and speeches\\", BBC News, 20 September 2004, accessed 30 September 2009Keith Wiley webpage, referring to the Code of Hammurabi See also *Contrapasso  References  Category:Punishments ","title":"Mirror punishment"},{"id":"2304705","text":"Pƒ±nar Saka (born 5 November 1985 in √úsk√ºdar, Istanbul, Turkey) is a Turkish female track running athlete in the sprint discipline competing in the categories 100 m, 200 m and 400 m.

The Kakanui River and its estuary divide the township in two. The part of the settlement south of the river, also known as Kakanui South, formerly \\"Campbells Bay\\", was developed as a collection of cribs (holiday homes). A recent increase in the development of subdivisions has increased the density of dwellings within South Kakanui.http://www.waitaki.govt.nz/NR/rdonlyres/F44D4DBF8-738F-4CD7-A898-102CC642D020/35820/SubdivisionSummaryv8.pdf The population was 372 people in the 2013 New Zealand census, a decrease of 42 from 2006. The Kakanui River reaches the sea near the town, and the low range known as the Kakanui Mountains stretches inland from south of Oamaru towards the Maniototo. Kai Tahu used to temporarily occupy Kakanui as they travelled north and south, as evidenced by the midden on the north side of the estuary. The area around Kakanui has a reputation for its limestone formations, and produces many fossils. Quarrying formerly took place. The rich and fertile soil of the area around the river has physical properties which make it perfect for use in sports grounds, especially cricket pitches. Many of New Zealand's top cricket venues use Kakanui soil on their wicket blocks. Beaches Kakanui's main beach, south of the main headland, is known as Campbell's Bay. It provides the first surfable break and the first safe swimming beach (apart from Timaru's Caroline Bay) south of Banks Peninsula. The beach has a length of approximately two kilometres, and the southern end, known as All Day Bay, offers more shelter than the northern end, but with less surf. The sandy beach below the shingle spit north of the river mouth stretching toward Oamaru is safely swimmable. The beaches south of the main headland feature orange sand. The northern beach has white sand. Horticulture Kakanui's rich volcanic soil suits intensive horticulture. The township contains a number of glasshouses, primarily used for growing tomatoes, but also producing cucumbers and capsicums (bell peppers). Land surrounding the settlement (especially to the north towards the settlement of Totara) also features market gardens (often operated by Chinese New Zealanders) growing a wide range of vegetables. Kakanui has a particular reputation for its new-season potatoes, which sell throughout all New Zealand. History Kakanui (originally Kakaunui) was once a bustling port on the northern side of the river, with a hotel, blacksmith, meat works, and a post office. Kakanui's commerce declined after the construction of the railway inland (going through Maheno) and with the advent of the frozen-meat trade from 1882. Naming error Kakanui is often named on maps as \\"Taranui\\". However, this name is not in use locally, nor is it evident on road signs. \\"Taranui\\" may be a naming error from early maps referring to a station farm of that name, located slightly inland from Kakanui.

Played by former Farscape actress Claudia Black, Vala was created by Damian Kindler and Robert C. Cooper as a guest character for the season 8 episode \\"Prometheus Unbound\\" (2004). Because of the on-screen chemistry between Black's Vala and Michael Shanks' character Daniel Jackson, and the character's popularity with the producers and the audience, Claudia Black became a recurring guest star in season 9 (2005-2006) and joined the main cast in season 10 (2006-2007). \\"Prometheus Unbound\\" introduces Vala as a sexy and mischievous human with a Goa'uld background from an unnamed planet. In season 9, Vala and Daniel set off the arc of the show's new villain race, the Ori. After giving birth to the Ori's new leader in season 10, Vala joins the SG-1 team to stop the enemy, eventually becoming a permanent member of both SG-1 and Stargate Command. Claudia Black resumed her role in the 2008 direct-to-DVD film Stargate: The Ark of Truth, which finishes the Ori arc. Black also appeared as Vala and her Goa'uld alter ego Qetesh in the 2008 film Stargate: Continuum. She was, however, not supposed to be returning for the announced third Stargate SG-1 direct-to-DVD film that was scheduled to be filmed in spring 2009, but abandoned since then. For her portrayal of Vala, Claudia Black was nominated for a 2006 Saturn Award in the category \\"Best Supporting Actress on Television\\", and won a Constellation Award in the category \\"Best Female Performance in a 2006 Science Fiction Television\\" in 2007. Role in Stargate=Character arc= Information about Vala's past is revealed over the course of several episodes of seasons 8 through 10 of Stargate SG-1. \\"Family Ties\\" gives insight into Vala's background with her father Jacek, a con artist who had left her and her mother to pursue his scams. As mentioned in \\"Flesh and Blood\\", Vala also had a stepmother named Adria, whom she held in little regard. * Vala: \\"Mother raised me.\\" / Jacek: \\"Which one?\\" / Vala: \\"My mother.\\" * Vala (to Jacek): \\"You were never there for Mother! Even though you always expected us to be there for you, whenever you needed a place to hide or capital to help set up one of your latest scams!\\" *Vala: \\"She [the Orici] wanted me to give her a name.\\" / Daniel: \\"And...\\" / Vala: \\"Adria. I told her it was my mother's...\\" / Daniel: \\"Not?\\" / Vala: \\"Stepmother. Witch of a woman.\\" Vala became an involuntary host to a Goa'uld named Qetesh in her adult life, but the Tok'ra were able to remove the symbiote. * Vala: \\"This was one of the many planets that Qetesh ruled over when I was her host. As you know, a Tok'ra eventually removed the symbiote but not before her people rebelled and tortured me thinking we were one and the same.\\" * Vala: \\"Ten years ago, a Tok'ra incited a rebellion on my planet. When people rose up against the ruling Goa'uld, and once the Jaffa had been overcome, the Goa'uld was captured alive, tortured, and beaten for days on end. I was host to that Goa'uld at the time. The people didn't understand that it was the symbiote that had ruled over them so harshly. I guess the Tok'ra felt responsible. He rescued me, removed the Goa'uld symbiote, nursed me back to health.\\" At the time of Vala's first encounter with SG-1 team member Daniel Jackson in the season 8 episode \\"Prometheus Unbound\\", she has become a thief and a con artist. She attempts to steal the Earth ship Prometheus for her own purposes, but when Daniel evades her sexual advances and thwarts her plans, she escapes. In the season 9 opener \\"Avalon\\", Vala seeks out Daniel at Stargate Command. Needing his linguistic skills, she uses a Kor mak bracelet to bind them together for a treasure hunt on Earth. The discovery of an Ancient communication device transports Vala's and Daniel's minds to a village in a distant galaxy where the local villagers kill Vala in a trial by fire, but a Prior, a servant of a race named the Ori, resurrects her. After Vala's and Daniel's safe return to Earth, the removed bracelets cause temporary after-effects that prolong Vala's stay at Stargate Command. In an attempt to stop the Ori from invading the galaxy in \\"Beachhead\\", Vala goes missing and appears to have died. Vala re-appears in the late season 9 episode \\"Crusade\\" and informs SG-1 via the communication device that she is in the Ori galaxy. The Ori have impregnated her against her will many months before, and Vala saw herself forced to marry a local villager named Tomin to make the pregnancy plausible. When Vala tells SG-1 about the Ori army approaching, the communication link is severed. Vala is last seen onboard one of the invading Ori battlecruisers in the closing scene of the season 9 finale \\"Camelot\\" when she goes into labor. Season 10 opens with Vala giving birth to a female. The Ori call the rapidly growing child Orici, but Vala gives her the name Adria after her stepmother. Attempts to turn the child away from the Ori remain unsuccessful. Having escaped the Ori, Vala is allowed sanctuary at Stargate Command and joins SG-1 on several missions, during one of which she comes face-to-face with her fully-grown daughter. Vala's provisionary acceptance on Earth is only lifted in the eighth episode of the season, \\"Memento Mori\\", in which she is finally made a full member of SG-1. Vala meets Tomin again in \\"Line in the Sand\\" and tells him the true story behind the Ancients and Ori. A final showdown in the series between Vala and Adria occurs in \\"Dominion\\", which leaves Vala with the loss of her daughter. In \\"Unending\\", the last episode of the series, SG-1 gets stuck in a time dilation field aboard the Earth ship Odyssey, and a romance between Vala and Daniel finally comes to fruition. Before the time dilation field is reversed after fifty years, erasing all linked memories in the process, Daniel and Vala express their feelings for each other. The Ori story concludes with Adria's disempowerment and Vala's and Tomin's amicable separation in the 2008 direct- to-DVD film Stargate: The Ark of Truth. Vala and her alter ego, Qetesh, appear in the alternate-timeline film Stargate: Continuum. =Characterization= Official Stargate sources advertised Vala as a \\"scheming, unscrupulous, thieving con artist\\", \\"feisty\\" and \\"occasionally fickle\\", with a \\"mysterious agenda\\" and a seemingly \\"amorous interest in Dr. Daniel Jackson\\". Genre magazine TV Zone subtitled Vala as a \\"thief, arms dealer, mercenary\\" who, when given an inch, will \\"take a mile, and whatever else she can get her hands on.\\" SFX described Vala as a \\"mischievous minx\\", whereas The San Diego Union- Tribune interpreted Vala as \\"ethically challenged\\". Steven Eramo of Starburst gave Vala the attributes \\"sexy, smart and always resourceful\\". Claudia Black characterized early Vala as \\"sassy\\", \\"intelligent\\", \\"manipulative\\", and \\"mercurial\\", but found it \\"very hard to tell what the real core of Vala is.\\" Black later described Vala as \\"a new, weird element\\", \\"irritating\\", \\"very vibrant\\", \\"sort of the hair-pulling variety\\", \\"really infuriating\\" and \\"[hopefully] funny\\". With Vala being a departure from Black's former Farscape role as Aeryn Sun, Black regarded Vala as a comedic and energetic character with streaks of irreverence and naughtiness who \\"says everything that everyone else is thinking, but doesn't dare say\\", although both characters share \\"being damaged goods [in the beginning] and on a path to becoming a better person\\". Robert C. Cooper thought of Vala as \\"a bit of a wild card\\" and \\"a very sexy character, who isn't afraid to take whatever she wants in any given situation.\\" Cooper and Black believed the character had a moral compass to her actions. =Relationships= Claudia Black and Michael Shanks (Daniel Jackson) linked their characters' early relationship to a Spencer Tracy/Katharine Hepburn dynamic of \\"not so much of tension, but rather constant antagonism\\". Despite the concern in early season 9 that their relationship would stagnate and dumb down their characters, Shanks felt Vala brought out a side of Daniel that he had not had the chance to play before, and Black advocated the slow revelation of Vala's layers of denial. The writers continued to develop the friendship between Vala and Daniel throughout season 10, aiming not to lose their sexual chemistry. Michael Shanks stated that by \\"Memento Mori\\", \\"Daniel legitimately cares about Vala and has seen some sort of redemption in her and wants that process to continue.\\" From Black's point of view, Daniel offers \\"an interesting window\\" into \\"Vala's external fa√ßade to be playful with people\\". He helps Vala grow as a person and forces her to \\"develop coping mechanisms that allow her to be more adult and learn that it's OK to be honest and talk how you feel.\\" Asked about a possible romance between Vala and Daniel before the filming of the series finale, Black predicted that a consummation of the relationship would end badly in terms of both story and on-screen chemistry. When producer Robert C. Cooper presented his preliminary script for the series finale, \\"Unending\\", both Black and Shanks protested his intended story of having Vala and Daniel sleep together without a confrontation. Shanks felt that \\"[t]here's always been this underlining, keeping [Vala] at arms length because of the fear of getting too close.\\" After Cooper rewrote the scene to increase Vala's vulnerability to Daniel, and have Daniel truthfully explain his feelings of a relationship, the actors decided to play the confrontation scene as genuinely as possible, with both characters being neither completely in-character nor totally out-of-character. Describing Vala's attitude towards bonding with other characters as \\"in a strange way quite level-headed\\" and \\"quite honest\\", Black interpreted Vala's behavior as a reaction to growing attached to people where the relationships never seem to work out. Cooper explained that by Vala's contacting of Stargate Command about the imminent threat at the end of season 9, she \\"has reached a point of honesty with [the SG-1] characters and possibly herself on a level that she's never had before.\\" From the beginning of season 10, Claudia Black and Amanda Tapping requested a similarly positive camaraderie between their characters as male characters have. Tapping noted Carter's respect for Vala despite them being at opposite ends in their actions; Tapping also thought Carter finds Vala amusing rather than annoying. A scene in \\"Morpheus\\" that was intended to establish this relationship was cut for time, and until the late season 10 episode \\"Family Ties\\" would accommodate this with a shopping scene, the actresses acknowledged their connection through looks and subtle nuances. By joining SG-1, Vala also shared a spot with stoic warrior Teal'c as the only alien members of the team, and actor Christopher Judge (Teal'c) explained that his character's amusement with Vala contributed to Teal'c's loosening up. The relationship between Vala and SG-1 team leader Colonel Cameron Mitchell (played by Ben Browder) was rarely emphasized in the series since Black and Browder were well known for formerly starring as star-crossed lovers in the cult sci-fi series Farscape. According to Black, Vala's motivation to hide her miraculous pregnancy by marrying the local villager Tomin (played by Tim Guinee) in late season 9 stems from \\"genuinely car[ing] for the man. She does something wrong, but she must in order to survive.\\" Against the audience's expectation, Vala and Tomin are shown as a seemingly functioning normal couple, and Vala makes several efforts to save him despite his deep indoctrination. Throughout season 10, Vala has to come to terms with her maternal feelings for Adria (as adult played by Morena Baccarin), well knowing from the beginning that Adria embodies a destructive entity that must be fought. Black believed Vala had to \\"try her best to connect with her daughter in the hope of finding ways to humanize her\\", despite her own lack of maturity. When Vala meets her father Jacek (Fred Willard) in \\"Family Ties\\", Vala shows \\"a slightly more dramatic and vulnerable side\\" that was new to the audience. Conceptual history=Creation and casting= Stargate SG-1 supervising producer Damian Kindler wrote \\"Prometheus Unbound\\" as a second-unit bottle episode for the middle of Stargate SG-1's season 8 in 2004. The main cast's availability was limited, as Richard Dean Anderson had a reduced season schedule, and Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge filmed \\"Gemini\\" in parallel to \\"Prometheus Unbound\\". Kindler therefore centered the episode on Michael Shanks' character Daniel Jackson and created Vala, a human character from an unnamed planet, as Daniel's one- episode adversary. Not fully content with Kindler's conservative approach, producer Robert C. Cooper amplified the character's cheeky and sexy personality in his own passes of the script. Although Cooper tried to respect Stargate SG-1's reputation as a sex-free family show, he was aware that the character's flirtatiousness might cause a strong audience reaction. Robert. C. Cooper suggested Australian actress Claudia Black for the role of Vala and contacted her agent two days before the filming of \\"Prometheus Unbound\\" began. The Stargate producers had approached Black several times before, but she had always been busy with other projects. At \\"Prometheus Unbound\\"'s casting stage, the actress had just finished dialogue looping sessions for Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars in Australia. She thought the script of \\"Prometheus Unbound\\" was funny and self-contained enough for creative experiments, so she accepted the role and called the episode's director, Andy Mikita, in advance. He suggested an Out of Sight-kind chemistry for Vala and Daniel, and encouraged the actress to push the character as far as possible. On set, Claudia Black and Michael Shanks decided to make one of their first scenes, a fight sequence, as funny and non-machismo as possible to mirror Daniel's non- military background. In the meantime, Black tried to transform her day-long jetlag and lack of sleep into humour. When the producers saw the on-screen chemistry between Black and Shanks, they decided to make the character a bigger part of the show. =Development= With actor Richard Dean Anderson's departure from the show in 2005, Stargate SG-1 saw cast changes at the beginning of season 9. Ben Browder and Beau Bridges joined the main cast as Lieutenant-Colonel Cameron Mitchell and Major General Hank Landry, respectively. At the same time, the producers re-introduced Vala in a six- episode story arc to cover for the maternity leave of SG-1 regular Amanda Tapping (Lieutenant-Colonel Samantha Carter). The producer intended to use Vala's unpredictability and wildcard status to break the bigger story arc and to acquaint the audience with the new characters. Claudia Black wished to broaden her horizon in comedic acting and agreed to the recurring role, but declined the producers' offer of a permanent role for personal reasons. Because Ben Browder and Claudia Black were well known for formerly starring as star-crossed lovers in the cult sci-fi series Farscape, the Stargate producers refrained from emphasizing the pairing of Mitchell and Vala beyond in- jokes.Upon meeting Mitchell for the first time in the season 9 premiere \\"Avalon\\", Vala remarks \\"I know we haven't met. That I'm sure I would remember.\\" The episode \\"200\\" features a short parody segment where Vala imagines the SG-1 members playing various Farscape characters. Vala plays Black's old role of Aeryn Sun, while Mitchell (Browder) plays the Farscape character Stark. Daniel (Shanks) plays Browder's old role of John Crichton. The producers instead opted to further the comedic chemistry between Claudia Black and Michael Shanks, who linked their characters' early relationship to a Spencer Tracy/Katharine Hepburn dynamic of \\"not so much of tension, but rather constant antagonism\\". Mirroring Vala's sexiness in season 8, \\"The Powers That Be\\" writer Martin Gero chose Qetesh, the Egyptian Goddess of Love and Beauty, as a fitting former Goa'uld identity for Vala. Nevertheless, Black and the producers refrained from portraying the character as too sexually manipulative. A scene from \\"The Ties That Bind\\", which was later cut for time, originally made clear that Wallace Shawn's character greatly exaggerated the sexual relationship between him and Vala. Claudia Black was brought back into the show for the last two episodes of season 9, at which time the actress was seven months pregnant. Producer Robert C. Cooper, who wrote and directed \\"Crusade\\", used the circumstances to set the stage for Adria, Vala's future daughter and the show's new villain in season 10. Claudia Black joined the cast full-time in season 10. Had Stargate SG-1 not been picked up for a new season, the producers would have considered the character for a spin-off series. To justify the character in a regular capacity, the producers toned her down and tried to find a suitable balance of sexual tension, fun and friendship. Claudia Black was convinced that Vala's actual stay with Stargate Command was justified despite the character's personality. Vala's renegade qualification to infiltrate the Ori served as a useful compliment to the military-oriented SG teams, and Vala had already proven a degree of allegiance through her actions in \\"Beachhead\\", holding off an immediate invasion of the enemy. The writers tested this loyalty through confrontation in the story, and writer Damian Kindler later compared Vala's character growth in season 10 to smuggler Lando Calrissian from Star Wars, a \\"former swindler who's gone legit\\". Careful to never have Vala become too earnest, Kindler never saw Vala \\"as the type of character who should be on the show for five, six, seven years. But definitely the sort of character who could come in for a couple of seasons, spice things up and then move on and come back and forth.\\" Evolving the relationship between Vala and the other SG-1 members, the producers also grew comfortable with pairing Browder's and Black's characters more often, and even teased (and misled) viewers about them \\"end[ing] up in a motel room bed together\\" in the episode \\"Memento Mori\\", involving underwear, \\"handcuffs as well as creamy Twinkies\\". A scene in the milestone episode \\"200\\" also parodied the show's connection to Farscape. In hindsight, Claudia Black would see season 10 as a personal challenge as her baby deprived her of sleep during the filming period. Her relocation to Vancouver and sickness in the family put her on a self-confessed personal and professional low. She nevertheless tried to stay true to her character \\"and not go for the cheap laugh\\". After a miscarriage scare during the filming of the first direct-to-DVD SG-1 film, Stargate: The Ark of Truth, Claudia Black's work on the film Stargate: Continuum was limited on strict doctor's orders. Although Black considered Continuum \\"not a Vala-centric piece\\" as she only \\"makes a brief appearance\\", Stargate producer Joseph Mallozzi thought \\"she's got some great, juicy scenes\\". Claudia Black mentioned an interest in portraying her character in the future, but Mallozzi rated the chances of her appearing in the planned Stargate Universe spin-off series as \\"not so good\\". Producer Brad Wright announced that Vala would not be returning for the announced third Stargate SG-1 direct-to-DVD film that was scheduled to be filmed in spring 2009. Claudia Black is the only SG-1 main cast member besides Corin Nemec (playing Jonas Quinn between SG-1's season 5 and 7) and Ben Browder (playing Cameron Mitchell from season 9 onward) who never appeared in Stargate Atlantis, although Vala is mentioned by Rodney McKay (played by David Hewlett) in the Atlantis season 5 episode \\"Identity\\". * McKay: \\"There are these stones and if you place them in one of several recesses around the outside of the device, it activates it and allows you to connect to someone far, far away across the galaxy - intergalactically, even, as was the case with Daniel Jackson and Vala.\\" =Costumes and make-up= Claudia Black made her entrance in Stargate SG-1 in a full-body Kull Warrior costume, not dissimilar to her first appearance as a Peacekeeper in Farscape. For her entrance in season 9's \\"Avalon\\", however, the costume designers intended her to wear a dress that the producers later deemed too revealing. Leaving the dress for Vala's appearance as Qetesh in \\"The Powers That Be\\", Vala's outfit for \\"Avalon\\" was switched to a black fetish leather gear which a costume designer described as \\"a dominatrix outfit\\". Black admitted the wildness of her \\"Avalon\\" wardrobe was not for her liking. But since it mirrored the attention-seeking personality of the character, and because the character does not spend much time in the same outfit anyway, the actress did not mind wearing it. Vala started wearing the normal SG team uniform in \\"Origin\\", the third episode of season 9. Claudia Black was later included in the design process and was given full control over her wardrobe for scenes that required civilian clothes. As such, Black chose Vala's underwear for the seduction scene in \\"The Ties That Bind\\" and her shopping tour outfit in \\"Family Ties\\". The latter episode also showed Vala with seven distinctly different hairstyles and outfits in total. Fearing the lack of seriousness, the producers opposed the make-up department's decision of having Vala wear curlers, but the scene could not be reshot. Similarly, a scene showing Vala unpacking her hair dryer and curling iron during an offworld mission in \\"The Quest\\" was deemed too silly and was trimmed to the basics; it would have been cut if the footage had allowed it. Due to Black's pregnancy during the filming of the films, the costume department needed to hide Black's bump with appropriate dressing. Reception Vala action figure, based on her appearance in the episode \\"Avalon\\" The character of Vala was immediately popular with the Stargate writers, producers and crew. During the filming of \\"Prometheus Unbound\\", people on set responded \\"very well\\" to the chemistry between Vala and Daniel. Director Andy Mikita called executive producer Robert C. Cooper during the first lunch break and told him to \\"hire this gal\\", and Cooper thought Vala/Black \\"was absolutely wonderful. The character really worked out.\\" Writer Damian Kindler \\"really loved\\" what Black brought to the show, believing that \\"her character, when used properly, is just absolutely wonderful grist for the mill on SG-1.\\" Stargate writer Martin Gero called Vala \\"so much fun to write, almost too fun. You do kind of get carried away.\\" Michael Shanks repeatedly stated in interviews that Claudia Black revitalized his interest in acting.HypaSpace: Stargate SG1 turns 200. April 27, 2006.

While TV Guide called Vala a \\"saucy [and] bodacious babe who immediately clicked with viewers\\", GateWorld's Darren Sumner and TheScifiWorld's Gilles Nuytens commented on her \\"warm reception..by fans\\" and her being \\"an instant hit with fans of the show\\". 71 percent of over 8000 GateWorld readers rated Claudia Black's portrayal of Vala in season 9 as \\"perfect\\".

The Sun Herald thought of the character as \\"a thoroughly charming intergalactic thief famed for using her allure to get what she wants\\", and Matt Roush of TV Guide called Claudia Black \\"great fun to watch in [seasons 8 and 9]\\". TV Zone's Stephen Graves believed that Browder and Black's first post-Farscape encounter in Stargate SG-1's \\"Avalon\\" was \\"somewhat underplayed - but Black makes up for this with her sparky, snarky characterization of Vala.\\" He welcomed the producers' decision to not cast a carbon copy of Samantha Carter, and thought that Claudia Black's Vala in her six-episode arc remained \\"the best thing in the series\\". By season 10's \\"Memento Mori\\", TV Zone's Anthony Brown felt that \\"Ben Browder and Claudia Black have...reached a point where they can play out an amusing take on Misery without you feeling that [their Farscape characters] have somehow starbursted onto SG-1's Earth\\". Maureen Ryan of The Chicago Tribune called Browder and Black's interaction in season 10 \\"great fun; the rapport they developed on the stellar Farscape was still much in evidence, even though they played radically different characters on SG-1.\\" Maureen Ryan described the chemistry between Black and Michael Shanks as \\"sparky\\" and \\"one of the most diverting parts of the latter seasons of the show\\". According to Ultimate DVD, the scenes between Vala and Daniel as the object of her affection resulted in \\"some of the freshest and funniest scenes in the show for some time\\". In reviewing \\"Unending\\", Anthony Brown called Vala \\"a character who's always had a little too much of comic relief [getting] torn apart by the nice guy of the team.\\" SyFy Portal attributed Stargate SG-1 not going stale after ten years to Black, as she \\"quite literally steals the show from the existing cast of heroes\\".

It harmonises the treatment of databases under copyright law and the sui generis right for the creators of databases which do not qualify for copyright.  Definition of database  Article 1(2) defines a database as \\"a collection of independent works, data or other materials arranged in a systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means\\". Non-electronic databases are also covered (para. 14 of the preamble). Any computer program used to create the database is not included (para. 23 of the preamble). Copyright protection of software is governed by Directive 91/250/EEC.  Copyright  Under Article 3, databases which, \\"by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents, constitute the author's own intellectual creation\\" are protected by copyright as collections: no other criterion may be used by Member States. This follows from the 1994 Agreement on the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), a widely adopted treaty to which all World Trade Organization members are party. TRIPS clarifies and arguably relaxes the criterion for protection of collections in the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, which covers \\"collections of literary and artistic works\\" and requires creativity in the \\"selection and arrangement\\" of the contents: in practice the difference is likely to be slight. Any copyright in the database is separate from and without prejudice to the copyright in the entries. The acts restricted by copyright are similar to those for other types of work (Art. 5): * temporary or permanent reproduction by any means and in any form, in whole or in part; * translation, adaptation, arrangement and any other alteration; * any form of distribution to the public of the database or of copies thereof, subject to the exhaustion of rights; * any communication, display or performance to the public; * any reproduction, distribution, communication, display or performance to the public of a translation, adaptation, etc. This shall not prevent the lawful use of the database by a lawful user [Art. 6(1)]: Member States may provide for any or all of the following limitations [Art. 6(2)], as well as applying any traditional limitations to copyright: * reproduction for private purposes of a non- electronic database; * use for the sole purpose of illustration for teaching or scientific research, as long as the source is indicated and to the extent justified by the non-commercial purpose to be achieved; * use for the purposes of public security or for the purposes of an administrative or judicial procedure. Copyright protection usually lasts for seventy years after the death of the last publicly identified author. Anonymous or pseudonymous works gain protection for the later of 70 years after the work is lawfully made available to the public or 70 years from creation. If national legislation makes particular provision for collective works or for a legal person (i.e. a body corporate) to be a rights holder the term of protection of calculated in the same way as for anonymous or pseudonymous works, with the exception that if any natural persons who created the work are given credit in versions made available to the public, the term of protection is calculated according to the lives of those authors. Art. 1, Directive 93/98/EEC).  Sui generis right  Copyright protection is not available for databases which aim to be \\"complete\\", that is where the entries are selected by objective criteria: these are covered by sui generis database rights. While copyright protects the creativity of an author, database rights specifically protect the \\"qualitatively and/or quantitatively [a] substantial investment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents\\": if there has not been substantial investment (which need not be financial), the database will not be protected [Art. 7(1)]. Database rights are held in the first instance by the person or corporation which made the substantial investment, so long as: * the person is a national or domiciliary of a Member State or * the corporation is formed according to the laws of a Member State and has its registered office or principal place of business within the European Union. Article 11(3) provides for the negotiation of treaties to ensure reciprocal treatment outside the EU: as of 2006, no such treaty exists. The holder of database rights may prohibit the extraction and/or re-utilization of the whole or of a substantial part of the contents: the \\"substantial part\\" is evaluated qualitatively and/or quantitatively and reutilisation is subject to the exhaustion of rights. Public lending is not an act of extraction or re- utilization. The lawful user of a database which is available to the public may freely extract and/or re-use insubstantial parts of the database (Art. 8): the holder of database rights may not place restrictions of the purpose to which the insubstantial parts are used. However, users may not \\"perform acts which conflict with normal exploitation of the database or unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the maker of the database\\", nor prejudice any copyright in the entries. The same limitations may be provided to database rights as to copyright in databases (Art. 9): * extraction for private purposes of the contents of a non-electronic database; * extraction for the purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, as long as the source is indicated and to the extent justified by the non-commercial purpose to be achieved; * extraction and/or re-utilization for the purposes of public security or an administrative or judicial procedure. Database rights last for fifteen years from the end of the year that the database was made available to the public, or from the end of the year of completion for private databases (Art. 10). Any substantial change which could be considered to be a substantial new investment will lead to a new term of database rights, which could, in principle, be perpetual. Database rights are independent of any copyright in the database, and the two could, in principle, be held by different people (especially in jurisdictions which prohibit the corporate ownership of copyright): as such, database rights can be compared to the rights of phonogram and film producers.

His \\"historical review of the stage\\", Roscius Anglicanus (1708), is an invaluable source for historians both of Restoration and of Stuart theater. Downes first enters the theatrical record in 1664, when he was registered by the Lord Chamberlain as a member of William Davenant's troupe under the patronage of the Duke of York. By his own admission, stage fright kept him from an acting career, although he is known to have played Haly in The Siege of Rhodes. Later in the 1660s, he is recorded as a member of Thomas Betterton's King's Company; his main work seems to have been as prompter. He continued in this function when the two companies united in 1682; when the companies split in 1694, he remained with Betterton until the middle of the next decade. He is the subject of a number of the Tatler; in this letter from Downes (presumably written by Steele), gives a brief account of Downes's life. He retired around 1706, and may be the John Downes recorded as buried in St Paul's, Covent Garden, in June 1712. Roscius Anglicanus Downes wrote his history of the Restoration stage between his retirement and death. It was published in 1708, and has served as a valuable resource ever since. Unlike earlier historians of English theater, such as Gerard Langbaine and James Wright, Downes approached the topic as an experienced insider; his concerns are those of a practical person of business, and he provides information that would otherwise be lost, particularly in the details of theatrical practice. He provides cast lists for countless plays, information on the success or failure of many pieces, and incidental comments on his own preferences. His accuracy is sometimes open to question, particularly as regards casting for often-staged plays. Still, as Sidney Lee notes, his work along with two or three other memoirs, \\"is practically all to which we have to trust for our knowledge of the Restoration stage.\\" References * Category:British historians Category:1710s deaths ","title":"John Downes (prompter)"},{"id":"2304753","text":"A psychological punishment is a type of punishment that relies not or only in secondary order on the actual harm inflicted (such as corporal punishments or fines) but on psychological effects, mainly emotions, such as fear, shame and guilt. This can occasionally cause severe cardiac harm, even death, but those are not strictly intended, and in the case of torture accidental death would even defeat the purpose. Psychological punishments that are particularly cruel or severe may be considered psychological torture. Very common is the use of shame through private or, especially, public humiliation. Other forms use may include isolating the one being punished or causing them to feel any type of psychological deprivation. For example, publicly shaving a woman's head may not only humiliate her in front of those who witness her shearing, it may also deprive her of her hair for as long as it takes to grow back, thus serving as a continual reminder of her punishment and her humiliation.
