It should be recognized that the understanding of, for example, libraries as information systems only goes back to about 1950. The application of the term information for earlier systems or societies is a retronym. The word and concept \\"information\\" The Latin roots and Greek origins of the word \\"information\\" is presented by Capurro & Hj√∏rland (2003).Capurro, Rafael & Hj√∏rland, Birger (2003).

In the transition from Middle Ages to Modernity the use of the concept of information reflected a fundamental turn in epistemological basis ‚Äì from \\"giving a (substantial) form to matter\\" to \\"communicating something to someone\\". Peters (1988, pp. 12‚Äì13) concludes: :Information was readily deployed in empiricist psychology (though it played a less important role than other words such as impression or idea) because it seemed to describe the mechanics of sensation: objects in the world inform the senses. But sensation is entirely different from \\"form\\" ‚Äì the one is sensual, the other intellectual; the one is subjective, the other objective. My sensation of things is fleeting, elusive, and idiosyncratic [sic]. For Hume, especially, sensory experience is a swirl of impressions cut off from any sure link to the real world... In any case, the empiricist problematic was how the mind is informed by sensations of the world. At first informed meant shaped by; later it came to mean received reports from. As its site of action drifted from cosmos to consciousness, the term's sense shifted from unities (Aristotle's forms) to units (of sensation). Information came less and less to refer to internal ordering or formation, since empiricism allowed for no preexisting intellectual forms outside of sensation itself. Instead, information came to refer to the fragmentary, fluctuating, haphazard stuff of sense. Information, like the early modern worldview in general, shifted from a divinely ordered cosmos to a system governed by the motion of corpuscles. Under the tutelage of empiricism, information gradually moved from structure to stuff, from form to substance, from intellectual order to sensory impulses.Peters, J. D. (1988). Information: Notes Toward a Critical History. Journal of Communication Inquiry, 12, 10-24. In the modern era, the most important influence on the concept of information is derived from the Information theory developed by Claude Shannon and others. This theory, however, reflects a fundamental contradiction. Northrup (1993)Qvortrup, L. (1993). The controversy over the concept of information. An overview and a selected and annotated bibliography. Cybernetics & Human Knowing 1(4), 3-24. wrote: :Thus, actually two conflicting metaphors are being used: The well-known metaphor of information as a quantity, like water in the water-pipe, is at work, but so is a second metaphor, that of information as a choice, a choice made by :an information provider, and a forced choice made by an :information receiver. Actually, the second metaphor implies that the information sent isn‚Äôt necessarily equal to the information received, because any choice implies a comparison with a list of possibilities, i.e., a list of possible meanings. Here, meaning is involved, thus spoiling the idea of information as a pure \\"Ding an sich.\\" Thus, much of the confusion regarding the concept of information seems to be related to the basic confusion of metaphors in Shannon‚Äôs theory: is information an autonomous quantity, or is information always per SE information to an observer? Actually, I don‚Äôt think that Shannon himself chose one of the two definitions. Logically speaking, his theory implied information as a subjective phenomenon. But this had so wide-ranging epistemological impacts that Shannon didn‚Äôt seem to fully realize this logical fact. Consequently, he continued to use metaphors about information as if it were an objective substance. This is the basic, inherent contradiction in Shannon‚Äôs information theory.\\" (Northrup, 1993, p. 5) In their seminal book The Study of Information: Interdisciplinary Messages,Machlup, Fritz & Una Mansfield (eds.). 1983. The Study of Information: Interdisciplinary Messages. New York: Wiley. Almach and Mansfield (1983) collected key views on the interdisciplinary controversy in computer science, artificial intelligence, library and information science, linguistics, psychology, and physics, as well as in the social sciences. Almach (1983,Machlup,Fritz. 1983. \\"Semantic Quirks in Studies of Information,\\" pp. 641-71 in Fritz Machlup & Una Mansfield, The Study of Information: Interdisciplinary Messages. New York: Wiley. p. 660) himself disagrees with the use of the concept of information in the context of signal transmission, the basic senses of information in his view all referring \\"to telling something or to the something that is being told. Information is addressed to human minds and is received by human minds.\\" All other senses, including its use with regard to nonhuman organisms as well to society as a whole, are, according to Machlup, metaphoric and, as in the case of cybernetics, anthropomorphic.

Hj√∏rland provided the following example: :A stone on a field could contain different information for different people (or from one situation to another). It is not possible for information systems to map all the stone‚Äôs possible information for every individual. Nor is any one mapping the one \\"true\\" mapping. But people have different educational backgrounds and play different roles in the division of labor in society. A stone in a field represents typical one kind of information for the geologist, another for the archaeologist. The information from the stone can be mapped into different collective knowledge structures produced by e.g. geology and archaeology. Information can be identified, described, represented in information systems for different domains of knowledge. Of course, there are much uncertainty and many and difficult problems in determining whether a thing is informative or not for a domain. Some domains have high degree of consensus and rather explicit criteria of relevance. Other domains have different, conflicting paradigms, each containing its own more or less implicate view of the informativeness of different kinds of information sources.

Harward Business Review, 36(6), 41-48.) intended to promote a technocratic vision for the future of business management. Its initial definition was at the conjunction of computers, operations research methods, and simulation techniques. Having failed initially to gain much traction (unlike related terms of a similar vintage such as information systems, information processing, and information science) it was revived in policy and economic circles in the 1970s with a new meaning. Information technology now described the expected convergence of the computing, media, and telecommunications industries (and their technologies), understood within the broader context of a wave of enthusiasm for the computer revolution, post-industrial society, information society (Webster, 1995Webster, F. (1995). Theories of the information society. New York: Routledge.), and other fashionable expressions of the belief that new electronic technologies were bringing a profound rupture with the past. As it spread broadly during the 1980s, IT increasingly lost its association with communications (and, alas, any vestigial connection to the idea of anybody actually being informed of anything) to become a new and more pretentious way of saying \\"computer\\". The final step in this process is the recent surge in references to \\"information and communication technologies\\" or ICTs, a coinage that makes sense only if one assumes that a technology can inform without communicating\\".Haigh, Thomas (2011).

Background  Since the Sino-Nepalese War of 1792, the Nepalese government had renounced all claims of influence in Tibet and maintained a policy of non-intervention in its affairs.Rose 1971, p. 108 With their victory in the war, the Qing Empire made Nepal a tributary state, but the wave of rebellions that afflicted China in the 1850s such as the Taiping Rebellion had crippled her capacity to enforce Imperial authority so far from Beijing and the Nepalese Prime Minister, Jang Bahadur Rana, saw an excellent opportunity to press for Nepalese objectives in Tibet without the threat of Chinese interference. Jang Bahadur used the alleged ill-treatment to the 1852 embassy,Led by Bhim Sen Rana after the death of Gambir Singh in Beijing abuses to Nepalese traders in Lhasa, a boundary dispute in the Kuti area, among other grievances to justify the Nepalese demands to the Tibetan government,Rose 1971, p. 110 which included territorial concessions and the payment of an indemnity. He declared war in March 1855Nepalese Army HQ, p. 28 and gave 17 April 1855 as the date limit for his conditions to be met.  War  = Summer campaign = Territorial Expansions up to Shigatse/Digarcha In early April 1855Page 1907, p. 77 Nepalese troops attacked across the major passes between Tibet and Nepal, from Walungchung to Jara, with the center of their advance in the Kuti and Kerong districts and were joined shortly later by reinforcements completing a total of 27000 men, with thirty-six guns and eight mortars.Page 1907, p. 77 The Kerung Axis was commanded by General Bom Bahadur Kunwar, with 25,728 troops. The Kuti Axis was commanded by General Dhir Sumsher with 4,678 troops. Humla and Mustang was commanded by General Krishna Dhoj Kunwar with 2,500 troops. And Olangchunggola Axis was commanded by Colonel Prithvi Dhoj Kunwar with a force of 2,000 men. Sethya Kaji was the main Tibetan commander with about 50,000 troops under his command. There were 8000 Tibetan troops stationed on Digarcha front, whereas 40,000 troops were concentrated in the Tingri area. On April 3 general Dhir Shamsher defeated a small Tibetan detachment at Chusan and captured Kuti and advanced to Suna Gompa.Rose 1971, p. 111 Kerong was occupied by Bam Bahadur without opposition and a Tibetan force at Kukurghat, north of Kerong, after which the Nepalese pushed on to Dzongka, the Tibetan main point of resistance in the area. The battle for Dzongka lasted 9 days after which the Tibetans retreated to Tingri. The capture of Dzongka was the last action of the campaign after which negotiations for a cease-fire began. The campaign had proven more costly for Jang Bahadur than what he expected. = Winter campaign = Negotiations carried on from May to September without a settlement. Nepal was unable to press its demands with another campaign since its treasury had been exhausted by the costs of the invasion and occupation of the Tibetan country, while in Nepal opposition to the war escalated. In Lhassa the failure of negotiations led to a renewal of hostilities, and this time it was Tibetan troops who took the offensive. General Kalon Shatra commanding the Tibetan army, launched two simultaneous attacks in November 5 on the Nepalese camps at Kuti and Dzongka.Rose 1971, p. 113 Surprised, the Nepalese lost 700 men in Kuti and the survivors fled to the border. The attack on Dzongka was less successful so the garrison there was besieged. The attacks were timed to coincide with the snowing season in the passes. Jang Bahadur sent reinforcements and in December Dhir Shamsher recaptured Kuti which he burned before retreating to Listi, back in Nepal. Meanwhile, colonel Sanak Singh Khattri relieved Dzongka.Rose 1971, p. 114  Conclusion  Negotiation resumed after military operations stalled. The Tibetans feared a rebellion in Kham while Nepalese finances were stretched to their limits. The Nepalese demand for ten million rupees was dropped to a nominal annual payment and Nepalese territorial ambitions were dropped. In the Treaty signed at Thapathali, the Tibetans agreed to pay an annual subsidy of ten thousand rupees to the Nepal Durbar and to allow a Nepalese trading station and agency to be established at Lhasa. Tibet paid lump sum of Rs. 50,001 as first installment, but refused to pay the following year which caused war between two nations to continue.Page 1907, p. 78  See also  *Sino-Nepalese War *China‚ÄìNepal relations *Treaty of Thapathali *Tibet under Qing rule  References  = Citations = = Sources = *p212  *  External links  * History of Nepalese Army: Nepal-Tibet Wars Category:Wars involving Tibet Category:Wars involving the Qing dynasty Category:Wars involving Nepal Category:Conflicts in 1855 Category:Conflicts in 1856 Category:1855 in China Category:1856 in China Category:1850s in Tibet Category:19th century in Nepal Category:Nepal‚ÄìTibet relations ","title":"Nepalese‚ÄìTibetan War"},{"id":"33656951","text":"Anthony Gerard Martin Barrett FRS, FMedSci is a British chemist, and Sir Derek Barton Professor of Synthesis, Glaxo Professor of Organic Chemistry at Imperial College London.

The illegitimate child of a notorious liaison, Danvers had four different names, changed religion four times and sided according to circumstances with Royalists, Parliamentarians, the restored monarchy and its opponents. Danvers was the illegitimate son of Frances Coke, Viscountess Purbeck, the estranged wife of John Villiers, 1st Viscount Purbeck, probably by Sir Robert Howard of Clun Castle, Shropshire and was baptised as Robert Wright. His mother was the daughter of Sir Edward Coke of Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire. After they were convicted of adultery, his parents went to France where he was educated between 1633 and 1641 under the name Howard and brought up as a Catholic. His mother brought him back to England at the start of the English Civil War and Lord Purbeck was persuaded to recognise him as his son and let him assume the name Villiers. As Villiers, he fought for the king at the Battle of Edgehill and in 1643 became a colonel of foot in the Royalist army and governor of Oswestry. In 1644 he was dismissed by Prince Rupert, became a Presbyterian and submitted to Parliament. He inherited the estates of his mother on her death in 1645. He paid fines of ¬£2,650 for his delinquency with borrowed money, but the estates were not freed of sequestration until 1653. Danvers married Elizabeth Danvers daughter of Sir John Danvers of Dauntsey, Wiltshire on 23 November 1648 and had two sons and three daughters.. After he married the daughter of the regicide Sir John Danvers he stated that he would have been willing to act as the King‚Äôs executioner. When his father-in-law died, Oliver Cromwell allowed him to assume the name and arms of Danvers \\"because those of the name of Villiers had sided\\" with the King. On Lord Purbeck‚Äôs death in 1658 he renounced the peerage. History of Parliament Online - Robert Danvers In 1659, Danvers was elected Member of Parliament for Westbury, Wiltshire in the Third Protectorate Parliament until he was expelled as a Cavalier. He was elected MP for Malmesbury in April 1660 for the Convention Parliament but after the Restoration, he was challenged over the treasonable remarks he made at the time of the King's execution. There followed a dispute over parliamentary privilege when he was summoned to the House of Lords as Viscount Purbeck on 15 June 1660 to answer charges. He argued that he was not a peer and on 27 July was discharged on bail for ¬£10,000. On 27 December 1660, he swore allegiance to the restored monarchy and entered into a bond of ¬£5,000 to do nothing to oppose it. Before Venner's rising in January 1661, Danvers spoke for the Anabaptists and against the monarchy. He was imprisoned in the Tower of London where he was still incarcerated on 2 July 1662 when his wife visited him there, and they were given licence to take the name and arms of Danvers. He was transferred to York gaol whence he escaped in 1664. In the course of the Second Anglo-Dutch War he was imprisoned on the Isle of Wight. In 1668 he was given the freedom of Wycombe. He was forced to leave England to escape his creditors, and died at Calais in 1674 where he was buried a Roman Catholic in the church of N√¥tre Dame.

They are composed of several clans and their ancient economic activities include fishing in Lake Victoria and other rivers such as River Sio, crop farming (obulimi), and animal farming (obutuki). The Samia speaking people, as widely known by other tribes, predominantly live in Busia districts (Both in Kenya and Uganda) and speak a dialect similar to the Luhya tribe in Kenya. However, on the Ugandan side there is a slight variation in the dialect spoken by the Samia of Southern Busia on the fringe of Lake Victoria and those of North Busia district closer to Tororo District. The former speak Olusamia while the latter speak Olugwe. The two dialects are difficult to differentiate by non Samia speaking people but easily discernible by the natives. Culture and Music Samia speaking people love music which is played in their various ceremonies, which include marriage (Obugole/ Obweya), funeral (amasika), veneration of ancestors (ebikuda mukutu and Enga'nyo), and wrestling (amalengo). Their musical instruments include: (a) A large violin-like wooden instrument called Adungu (b) A drum called Engalabe, covered at one end with the skin of a monitor lizard (c) A flute called Erere and (d) An instrument called Sikudi. The major traditional dances are owaro, ekworo, eboodi and esikudi. The eboodi and ekworo are love dances. Owaro and esikudi are performed when people are happy. Clans Samia speaking people have a number of clans, each person belongs to the father's clan. You can not marry from your clan or your mothers clan. History Years before modern government, Samia people used to live in villages called Engongo which are separated by valleys and within Engongo they had Engoba. Engoba is many; one is called Olukoba. One needed a ladder-like contraption to access or leave Olukoba but the Olukoba also had specific gates. Up to today, the daily lives of Samia people are dictated by customs and traditions. For instance, a woman who loses her husband should be remarried to a brother of the deceased so that should this widow wish to bear more children, they should resemble their kin. Their diet consists of cassava bread made of sorghum or millet, often mixed with fermented cassava also called obusuma. Sometimes white stiff porridge made out of maize flour added. The food is eaten with vegetables, meat, or chicken. The Samia also largely consume gruel, rice and bananas. Samia speaking people are known to be very clever people due to frequent consumption of fresh fish. In fact non Samia speaking people often refer to them as \\"obusuma ne'ngeni bicha speed\\" meaning brown stiff porridge and fish roll down the throat very fast.

The works were unveiled in 1988 and have become controversial for their use of copyrighted images. Several editions of the sculptures have sold at auction for millions of dollars. Series details The series consists of a number of large sculptures inspired by Hummel figurines and has been described as kitsch. They were designed to convey the emotion of \\"lying in the grass and taking a deep breath\\". When it was first unveiled, the series was simultaneously on show at three different galleries - at the Sonnabend Gallery in New York City, at the Donald Young Gallery in Chicago and at the Galerie Max Hetzler in CologneAnthony Haden-Guest: True Colors. The Real Life of the Art World. Atlantic Monthly Press, New York 1998, , p. 150. \\\\- possible because several editions of each sculpture were made. Koons promoted his works by taking out four advertisements in the major trade magazines. Each of the full-page features depicted different parts of Koons' reputed persona: #A propagator of the banal: Koons is shown alongside two pigs - published in Flash Art #A bad influence on future generations: he is in a classroom full of children, a blackboard contains the slogans \\"Exploit the Masses\\" and \\"Banality as Savior\\" - published in Artforum #A gigolo: he is standing in front of a boudoir-style tent - published in Flash Art #A ladies man: he is with a Shetland pony and several women in bikinis - published in Arts Magazine and Art in America The advertisements were the first time that Koons was featured in his own work, exploiting the reputation that the media and his critics had propagated. Several sculptures from the series have been adjudged to have broken copyright laws. Koons has defended his works on numerous occasions but the courts have repeatedly rejected his claims of fair use by parody. Constituent sculptures Most of the sculptures are made of porcelain; three editions of each were produced in addition to the artist's proof. The most notable pieces are detailed below. =Bear and Policeman= A smiling brown bear wearing a striped T-shirt has his arm around a shorter policeman who is looking up at the animal. =Fait d'Hiver= Fait d'Hiver depicts a woman lying on her back in the snow. The upper torso and head of the woman are featured in the sculpture, her breasts exposed beneath a sparsely-knitted dress. A pig and two penguins stand near to her head, adding the kitsch element that is thematic throughout the collection. The catalogue colourfully described the work as a \\"Walt Disney version of an erotic fantasy ... juxtaposing a strong sexual element with the saccharine sweetness of decorative knicknacks\\". It went on to say that the \\"disturbing combination identifies a primal hunger at the heart of American consumerism\\". Koons based the design of the woman on a photograph of porn actress Ilona Staller that featured in Stern. He had not met Staller at the time but went on to have a very public relationship with her, using her as a muse for many subsequent works. In November 2001 an edition of the sculpture was auctioned by Phillips de Pury & Company with an estimate of up to US$2.5 million but it failed to sell. Several years later, on November 13, 2007, Christie's auctioned the artist's proof with a final sale price of US$4.3 million. In 2018 a French court found that Koons' sculpture had plagiarised a 1985 advertisement for , a women's clothing retailer. Damages and costs were awarded against Koons but the sculpture was not seized. =Michael Jackson and Bubbles= In 1988, Jeff Koons made three identical porcelain sculptures of Bubbles and Jackson. At the time, each sculpture was said to be worth $250,000. Koons once said of the pop star, \\"If I could be one other living person, it would probably be Michael Jackson.\\" The art piece went on to become one of Koons' best known works. The figure shows Jackson and the chimpanzee wearing gold military-style suits. In 2001, one of the figures was put up for auction and was expected to fetch between $3 million and $4 million. The figure sold to an anonymous telephone bidder for $5.6 million. The sale was a record for a work by Koons. =Pink Panther= Pink Panther is a 41-inch tall porcelain sculpture featuring Jayne Mansfield holding the cartoon character Pink Panther. Mansfield is sculpted from the waist up and is partly clothed, her breasts being exposed; her right hand covers her nearly-exposed breast. The Pink Panther is shown in full, his chin over the left shoulder of Mansfield. Robert Storr, curator of the Department of Painting and Sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art, commented on the piece: \\"His mating of Jayne Mansfield and the eponymous cartoon character in Pink Panther is a thoroughly enjoyable send-up of heterosexual rapture and celebrity romance.\\" Koons' himself states that the piece was intended to represent the Pink Panther as a female masturbation aid. His depiction of the character caused legal issues and Koons was sued for copyright infringement, eventually settling out of court. One edition of Pink Panther was sold at Sotheby's in May 2011 with a complementary description in the catalogue entry: On May 10, 2011, it sold significantly below the US$20‚Äì30 million expected price, reaching US$16,882,500. =Saint John the Baptist= Inspired by Leonardo da Vinci's painting, St. John the Baptist, Koons' sculpture was made in the same pose but he also added a pig and a bird into the saint's arms. His outstretched arm points to a cross. It has been described as \\"an insouciant yet sinister conflation of the sacred and the profane\\". One edition of the sculpture was set to go on show at the Wright Exhibition Space in Seattle in February 2004, but it was discovered to have a sizeable crack along the arm. Bought in 1991 for US$150,000, the damage is expected to have reduced the resale price of the piece, though none of the editions have been sold at auction since. Patricia Leavengood, a sculpture conservation specialist, partly restored the damage and reduced the visibility of the crack. She noted, however, that \\"When it cracked, part of it slid forward and can't be moved back into place ... Porcelain wasn't meant to exist at this size. My primary task is to stabilize the piece, and that I can do.\\" =String of Puppies= String of Puppies is a porcelain sculpture depicting a man and a woman sat on a bench holding eight blue puppies. The inspiration came from a photograph by Art Rogers entitled Puppies. Koons found the picture on a postcard and, when he gave it to his assistants with instructions on how to model the sculpture, he asked that as much detail be copied as possible. He requested a few changes to the original, asking for the puppies to be blue with exaggerated noses, and for flowers to be added to the hair of the man and woman. The three editions of the sculpture were sold for a total of $367,000. Upon discovering that his picture had been copied, Rogers sued Koons and the Sonnabend Gallery for copyright infringement. Koons admitted to having copied the image intentionally and, in 1992, the court found \\"substantial similarity\\" between the two works and that Koons acted in a \\"willful and egregious\\" manner. They rejected his parody argument and awarded a significant settlement to Rogers. =Ushering in Banality= A pig with a green ribbon is being pushed by two young angels (alongside it) with a young boy dressed in a tracksuit behind it. Ushering in Banality was ruled to have \\"deliberately and exactly copied\\" a photograph by Barbara Campbell. Koons had instructed his Italian studio to replicate Campbell's Boys with Pig using it as a model for the design. At a Sotheby's auction in November 2001 one of the three editions of Ushering in Banality sold for US$1,875,750. =Wild Boy and Puppy= Wild Boy and Puppy is a porcelain sculpture featuring a yellow cartoon dog, a \\"wild boy\\" with red spiky hair, and a bumblebee in a basket. The cartoon dog is a clear replica of Odie from the Garfield comic strip by Jim Davis with only minimal changes. In 1993, United Feature Syndicate, Inc. sued Koons for his unsanctioned use of Odie, successfully arguing that he had breached copyright law. Koons had defended himself in other cases using the parody argument but could not do so here‚Äîhe testified to being unaware of the source of the character and therefore could not have directed the parody at the comic. One edition of the sculpture sold in November 2004 for US$1.5 million, significantly higher than its US$400,000 estimate.

'Mountain bike trials, also known as observed trials, is a discipline of mountain biking in which the rider attempts to pass through an obstacle course without setting foot to ground. Derived from motorcycle trials, it originated in Catalonia, Spain as ' (from trial sin motor, \\"motorcycle trials without an engine\\") and is said to have been invented by the father of Ot Pi, a world champion motorcycle trials rider. Pi's father had wanted his son to learn motorcycle trials by practicing on an ordinary bicycle. Trials riding is an extreme test of bicycle handling skills, over all kinds of obstacles, both natural and man-made. It now has a strong ‚Äì though small ‚Äì following worldwide, though it is still primarily a European sport. Skills taken from trials riding can be used practically on any bicycle for balance, for example controlled braking and track standing, or balancing on the bike without putting a foot down. Competition trial bikes are characterized by powerful brakes, wide handlebars, lightweight parts, single- speed low gearing, low tire pressures with a thick rear tire, distinctive frame geometry, and usually no seat.  Rules  Briton Joe Oakley receives a one-point penalty for \\"dabbing\\" the ground with his foot. The official indicates this with a raised finger. The general principle in a bike trials competition is to ride a number of pre-marked sections (usually 2 laps of 10 sections or 3 laps of 7 sections), the winner being the rider with the fewest points at the end of the competition. Currently there are two official types of competition rules, enforced by the UCI and BikeTrial International Union. The maximum number of points that can be obtained in each section is 5, the lowest (and best) score is 0 points or 'clean'. The most common way to gain a point is by putting a foot down within a section; for this reason points are sometimes known as 'dabs'. Certain rules enforce the number of points gained within a section, for example, putting both feet down or a hand will result in 5 points. Exceeding the time limit for the course will either result in 5 points (BIU rules) or an additional point for every 15 seconds over the limit (UCI rules). = UCI = Riders inspecting a section, as permitted under UCI regulations. Within UCI rules, if any part of the bike except the tires touch any object in the course, a dab will be given. The UCI rules were changed to this format after too many competitions ended in a draw and riders were forced to ride an extra section. UCI rules also allows riders to compete in both mod and stock categories. When a rider is in a section, neither tire is allowed to cross the side boundary tape even if the wheel is in the air. The rider's hands must remain on the handlebars. Before beginning a section, a rider is allowed to walk through it, and examine all the elements, but must not enter it with their bike. The UCI Mountain Bike & Trials World Championships are held annually and crown a 20-inch and 26-inch wheel trials world champion. = BIU = Bicycle trials rider The rules are unlike UCI scoring and parts of the bike (for example, bash guard or bash ring, cranks and pedals) can rest on an object without resulting in a 'dab'. = Interscolar = The rules are the same as the \\"BIU\\" but only people belonging to a club or school can compete in these, these are for lower level students to learn how to compete.  Bike design  Close-up of the cranks of a trials bike. Note the very small chainring = Frames = Trials bikes are often designed without regard for attaching a seat. Competition riding does not require the rider to sit down and the omission allows for a lighter bike which interferes less with the body movements of the rider. For the same reason most trials frames are as low as possible, often to such a degree that at top dead centre, the pedals are higher than the frame is above the bottom bracket (BB). In terms of geometry, trials frames, especially those biased towards competition, tend to have BB spindles positioned significantly higher than the line between the axles. BB rise is one of the significant dimensions used in describing a trials frame with rises between 30 and 75 mm being common in 26\\" frames. Many competition style 24\\" frames aim to place the BB at the same height relative to the ground as a 26\\" frame and so have a BB rise 25 mm (1\\") more than a similar feeling 26\\" frame. Street riding biased 24 and 26\\" frames tend to have lower BB's than competition frames. Trials frames will often have holes in the front of the head tube and elsewhere such as the BB shell, the seat tube and the dropouts to reduce frame weight. This feature is not commonly seen in mountain bikes, mostly due to mountain bikes' increased exposure to mud and dust and the attendant maintenance problems having an easy route for dirt to take into the headset and BB particularly will cause. The disc brake mounts on trials frames will be more heavily reinforced than those on normal mountain bikes as trials riding routinely requires much higher brake forces than seen in mountain bike riding, especially forces acting backwards on the rear brake. Unlike virtually all other off-road bike frames in production, trials frames, especially stock frames are often made without disk mounts. Most trials frames have four-bolt mounts specifically for hydraulic rim brakes, as this is the most popular choice for the rear brake in a trials bike. The four-bolt mount is not commonly seen on any bicycle frame other than trials bikes. Current production trials frames are most commonly made in various aluminium alloys, but frames are available made from steel, titanium, magnesium, and carbon fibre. = Brakes =  Rim vs. disk  Trials brakes must create more stopping torque than standard bicycle brakes and are set up, especially on the rear, with more emphasis on locking the wheel they act on than bringing the bike to a smooth halt from speed. For larger wheeled trials bikes, brakes that act directly on the rim are more popular, namely hydraulic rim brakes and cable actuated V Brakes, though disk brakes are also used, especially on the front wheel, by most riders. Virtually all competition only riders on 26\\" wheeled bikes use hydraulic rim brakes on both wheels, while for 20\\" competition the split is more even between rim brakes and disks. The main reason for the preference for rim brake on the back of 26\\" wheeled bikes is that there is significant wind-up between the wheel rim and the hub while hopping on the back wheel thanks to the longer spokes and bigger wheel and disk diameter used compared to a 20\\" wheel. This occurs because disk brakes hold the hub still rather than the rim. The effect is noticeable as a springiness in the bike when on the back wheel and this feels less precise and confidence inspiring to many riders than a rim brake, which holds the wheel directly at the rim.  Rim grinding  To make a rim brake lock the wheel as firmly as possible a number of techniques are used. The most common is where the braking surface of the rim is roughened using an angle grinder. This creates what trials riders refer to as a ground rim. Rim grinds can vary from quite light where the rim surface is very slightly roughened, all the way to a 'harsh' grind, where the rim has deep grooves (Heading for 1 mm deep if very harsh) in it. A grind may be referred to as 'dead' if it has been used a lot and the brake pads have started to polish it back smooth. Depending on the weather conditions and the brake pad compound chosen, different levels of grind are required for peak brake performance. Ground rims give consistent lock and hold in all but the muddiest conditions, making them more popular in wetter climates than smooth rims.  Rim tar  Other methods of increasing braking power for rim brakes include rubbing a very thin layer of roofing or road tar on the braking surface of a smooth rim. This works by effectively sticking the brake pads to the rim and for this reason, much harder pads than are suitable for ground rims can be used with good results and excellent pad durability compared to ground rims. Since the pads stick to the rim, the brake often doesn't release as cleanly as a ground brake or a disk however. The main downside to this method is that, similar to a smooth rim, even small amounts of moisture will drastically reduce the stopping performance of this braking setup. Some spray- on products are available to coat rims to give a tar like stopping performance. Generally only riders who live in very dry climates or ride only on dry surfaces in dry weather favour this method of enhancing the brake.  Brake boosters  Rim brakes are also often enhanced by fitting 'brake boosters'. These are horseshoe shaped plates which are bolted between the brake pistons (Or arms in the case of V Brakes), forming a bridge over the tyre. This increases the force needed to push the brakes apart, giving a stiffer feel at the brake lever and in many cases better brake bite and hold. In hydraulic rim brakes this has a second benefit which is to protect the brake line which loops over the tyre between the brake pistons from being accidentally hit and broken.  Other considerations  Street biased riders tend to choose disk brakes more often. Part of this is that disks are almost invariably better at controlling the speed of a bike while it is rolling, that is they can take more energy per unit time from the rider (i.e. they have more power, which is why they dominate all other off-road cycling disciplines), but most disks will not hold a wheel locked as firmly as a rim brake, making them less desirable for competition trials. Rim brakes set up for trials tend to squeal or howl if they are pulled while the wheel is turning, occasionally leading to trials riders attracting undesirable attention or being considered a nuisance for noise pollution. UCI regulations only stipulate that the bike must have a working front and rear brake. = Wheels = Trials bike rims are significantly wider than those used for cross country, downhill and BMX bikes. Wider rims mean that any given tyre fitted to the rim will hold a bigger volume of air thanks to the tyre beads being held further apart by the rim. This means the tyre has a wider contact patch and therefore can be run at lower tyre pressure. The change in volume of a tyre on a wide rim when landed on a sharp corner will tend to be greater than that of a narrow rim, which again leads to improved pinch puncture resistance, critical for trials as landing on sharp edges is a very common requirement of both competition and street trials. A wider rim also makes it much harder for a tyre to roll off the rim when exposed to side loads, again a very common occurrence in trials riding. The downside to having very wide rims is that trials rims are heavy compared to narrower rims. To save weight trials rims almost always have large holes through them between each spoke hole to save weight. To stop the tube from bulging through the holes when the tyre is inflated, a heavy plastic rim strip is used to cover the holes. The pressure in the tube will bulge the rim strip a small amount towards the centre of the wheel, but this will not lead to a tube failure. To increase the resistance of the tyres to pinch puncturing, most trials bikes are fitted with thicker walled tyres, especially on the rear wheel. These tyres are also used by downhill riders for the same reason. The tubes used in a trials bike tend to be similar to those used for downhill riding also. The hubs used for trials bikes tend to be very similar to those used for cross country mountain biking at the front, though the trials hubs tend to have more cutouts to save weight (Which would fill with mud if used for cross country, potentially making the hub heavier than if it was made from solid metal) and less emphasis on sealing at the bearings as surviving high mileage is not usually a priority with trials hubs. Rear trials hubs tend to be divided into two main types based on the dropout spacing they are designed for, 135 mm and 116 mm, sometimes referred to as 110 mm, with the remaining 6 mm occupied by snail cams, which are a popular means of tensioning the chain in horizontal dropout frames. Of the shorter hubs, almost all of them are 'screw-on' hubs, where the sprocket or freewheel that is fitted to the hub screws onto the side of the hub. There are some hubs of this length that have a freewheel mechanism built into them, most of which are used mainly in BMX. There are also a small number of hubs with a splined section machined onto the side of the hub where a sprocket can be attached with no freewheel mechanism. 135 mm spaced trials hubs originally were taken from mountain bikes, but modern designs are focused on making room for as many sprockets as possible and often don't have the torque carrying capacity needed to be safe for trials use. Many of them also don't pick up drive quickly enough to give a trials rider the instant pedal response required for precision riding. For comparison some mountain bike hubs have as few as 16 clicks per revolution, or one click every 22.5 degrees rotation. The lowest click count in any trials hub on the market is 48, or one click every 7.5 degrees. If the hub has no freewheel mechanism built into it, then a front freewheel is required, which screws onto the crank. These were initially taken from BMX or singlespeed/utility bikes and use the same threads as screw-on rear hubs. It was found that most BMX freewheels weren't strong enough for trials use and for this reason trials specific freewheels were designed. Trials freewheels are available with up to 120 clicks per revolution to give excellent drive pickup. Since the torque capacity of the freewheel must be extremely high (Fitted to the crank the freewheel will see the highest torques in the bike drivetrain), instead of making a ratchet with 120 teeth and small ratchet pawls to engage them, the ratchet ring has 40 deep teeth which are less prone to chipping or rounding. These are engaged by 3 ratchet pawls at a time, with 9 in total in the freewheel. Each set of 3 pawls is offset by 1/120 of a revolution from the previous set. This is either achieved by using identical pawls with slight offsets in the machining of the seats for the pawls or by having the pawls in each set of 3 pawls shorter or longer than the other sets of 3. = Gear ratios = Virtually all trials bikes in current production have one gear. The gear ratio chosen by most riders results in the bike moving approximately the same distance per turn of the pedals regardless of the wheel size. The most popular gear ratios are given below and most riders will choose a rear cog size within 1 tooth of those given below: 18:15 (1.2:1 - the bike rolls 2.49 m (98\\") for one complete turn of the cranks) for 26\\" bikes. 18:14 (1.286:1 - the bike rolls 2.46 m (97\\") for one complete turn of the cranks) for 24\\" bikes. 18:12 (1.5:1 - the bike rolls 2.39 m (94\\") for one complete turn of the cranks) for 20\\" bikes. Most mountain bikes have several gears lower than are used for trials bikes but most mountain bike gears are higher. The gear ratio chosen for a trials bike is to provide the power and quick acceleration needed to move the bike at the typically low speeds of trials riding. According to current competition standards there are two classes of trials bike recognized. As the distinguishing characteristic of the classes is the bike's approximate wheel diameter, the classes are known as 20‚Ä≥ and 26‚Ä≥. These specific sizes were adopted from previously available bikes. = 20‚Ä≥ ‚Äì 'Mod Bikes' = A rider on a 20\\" trials bike. The first purpose made and commercially available trials bikes were manufactured by Montesa\\"In Spain around 1980, Pedro Pi, a Montesa executive and rider, started trialsin. Pedro also designed the 20x20 Montesa trials bicycle, which evolved into the Monty.\\" a mototrials company and were based on the modified bmx bikes that riders had been using. As a result of being based on BMX bikes, the rear dropout spacing is 116mm. These 20‚Ä≥ wheeled trials bikes have become known colloquially as Mod bikes. Some mod bikes have a 19\\" rear wheel to make room for a bigger tyre, but the overall tyre diameter is similar regardless of the rim size, so this is mostly important as a compatibility issue for spare parts. = 26‚Ä≥ ‚Äì 'Stock Bikes' = Early mountain bikes were well suited to the trials riding and so a separate class was introduced for them. 'Stock Bikes' used to refer to a 26\\" wheeled mountain bike kept in original or 'stock' condition, i.e. not modified like a mod bike. Stock classed bikes were required to have at least six working gears and a seat. Now however, this designation is used to describe any trials bike with 26‚Ä≥ wheels, as current 26\\" trials bikes look about as similar to mountain bikes as 20\\" trials bikes look like BMXs. Historically stock bikes all had 135 mm spaced dropouts to take a standard mountain bike rear hub. There is a subcategory of Stock trials bikes, sometimes called 'Modstock Bikes', which have 26\\" wheels but have horizontal dropouts spaced at 116 mm, similar to mod bikes. Horizontal dropouts at both spacings are becoming more and more common in stock bikes as they eliminate the need for a chain tensioner, making the bike lighter (The chain is tensioned by moving the wheel backwards in the dropouts; vertical dropouts are designed to hold the wheel in one position only and therefore require a separate means of tensioning the chain to accommodate wear). = 24‚Ä≥ ‚Äì 'Street trials hybrid Bikes' = These bikes have 24\\" wheels and usually have horizontal dropouts, spaced at 135mm or 116 mm similar to 26\\" bikes. They are not legally allowed to compete in competitions and were originally designed to suit riders with a more \\"street\\" style. (e.g. spins, manuals, bunnyhops). An increasing number of 24\\" wheeled frames have become available designed for competition style riding rather than street riding. These offer a good compromise between the length of a 26\\" frame for bridging between obstacles and the ease with which a 20\\" bike can be lifted to the back wheel. Bicycle trial rider about to jump (in Spain)  Course design  A highly artificial course consisting of trucks and earthmoving equipment, at the 2009 world championships. UCI regulations stipulate that a course consist of at least 14 sections per course, including repeated sections. At most two sections can be composed entirely of artificial elements. Both sides of the course are marked with plastic tape, and there must be a clear stretch of 3 metres prior to the finish line, in order to prevent riders jumping over the line from an obstacle. Maximum obstacle jump heights are specified, from 0.80 to 1.80 metres depending on category. The sections, each approximately 60m in length, are laid out on a circuit to allow riders to ride from one section to the next, but whether the sections have to be completed in order depends on the individual competition.  Street trials  Street trials, or freestyle bike trials, is a non-competitive variant, using features found in the urban environment. It is the trials equivalent of street skateboarding or street freestyle BMX. More fluid than competitive trials riding, it encompasses the same skills: very precise control of the bike, through jumps and balancing on very narrow obstacles.

Be aware dark colors will get hotter and could harm the growing plants, porous containers will dry out faster than metal or plastic, and previous contents such as paint could be toxic to plants and people. ; Traunfeld, Jon. \\"Container Vegetable Gardening: Healthy Harvests from Small Spaces.\\" Home & Garden. Maryland Cooperative Extension - University of Maryland, Apr 2006. Web. 8 Nov 2011. Put the container where it will get western and southern exposure for the sunniest and warmest conditions or an eastern and northern exposure if shadier and cooler conditions are required. Warm season crops (squash, eggplant, tomato, pepper, etc.) need six to eight hours of direct sun and cool season crops (Asian greens, spinach, lettuce, etc.) need three to five hours. Fill the container with a growth medium, you want something light and porous. Commercial soil-less mixes tend to work very well. Coarse builder's sand is good because it is very porous and heavy, which helps weigh down containers. Also, compost is highly recommended. Some good media mixtures for container vegetables include: 100% compost, 100% soil-less mix, 25% garden soil + 75% compost, 25% soil-less mix + 25% garden soil + 50% compost, 25% garden soil + 75% soil-less mix, 50% soil-less mix + 50% compost (Recommended by the Maryland Cooperative Extension). If fertilizer is used, use a slow release version. Just about any herb or vegetable can be grown in a container. Look for seed packages labeled dwarf, bush, or small if space is limited. The University of Maryland Cooperative Extension recommends media depth of four to six inches for things like leaf greens, Asian greens, mustards, garlic, radish, basil, cilantro, thyme, mint, and marjoram. Salad greens and some herbs have shallow, fibrous root systems and are well suited to shallow containers with a large surface area. Eight to twelve inch pots are ideal for beans, beets, chard, carrots, cabbage, pepper, eggplant, tomato, squash, rosemary, parsley, lavender, and fennel. Pot volume can also vary based on crop; one to three gallon containers are great for herbs, green onions, radishes, onion, chard, pepper, dwarf tomato, dwarf cucumber, and basil. A larger size of four to five gallon is recommended for full-size tomato, cucumber, eggplant, beans, peas, cabbage, and broccoli. ; Traunfeld, Jon. \\"Container Vegetable Gardening: Healthy Harvests from Small Spaces.\\" Home & Garden.

Tower gardening  Many gardeners face the problem of having limited space to cultivate their plants in. One solution is to garden up, instead of out. Tower gardening is a form of gardening which utilizes vertical space and therefore can be implemented in restricted spaces.\\"Vertical Gardening.\\" WSU Clark County Extension. Washington State University, June 2005. Web. 19 Nov. 2011. Tower gardens are perfect for first time gardeners because they are easy to maintain.

NSA Juice Plus. Web. 19 Nov. 2011. There is less kneeling involved and gardeners get less dirty managing a tower garden compared to traditional gardens. The structure of a tower garden consists of several pots stacked on top of one another with a stabilizing rod placed through the center. The pots decrease in size as the tower grows taller. Start with a large pot for the base. Drill a hole in the bottom of each pot that is big enough for the support rod to fit through. Also, make holes for drainage in the bottom of each pot. Adequate drainage is essential to have a thriving tower garden. Fill the base pot with soil. Place a second pot on top of the base pot and fill it with soil. Continue to stack pots until the desired height is reached.

When choosing which plants to include in the garden, there are several factors which should be considered. The growing conditions of the plant should be consistent with the conditions where the plant will be kept. The amount of upkeep required by the plant is also important. Gardeners with little time may want to choose plants that don't require a lot of attention while more gardeners who plan on devoting more time to the garden should choose plants that are more meticulous. Finally, the amount of money devoted to the project should also be specified. Some plants require more financial support than others.  Windowsill gardening  Windowsill garden Gardening in windowsills may be the easiest way to have access to edible plants.

The plants should also be turned about a quarter turn weekly to ensure that all sides of the plant are receiving an equal amount of sunlight. A windowsill box can also be purchased to be placed inside or outside on windowsills.

Three people were killed and more than 60 others were injured in the crash, which happened in dense fog during the early morning rush hour. At around 6:20 a.m. a lorry, driven by David Fairclough of Wednesfield, entered the M42 from a slip-road at a speed of and, after slowing to , rammed into the rear of a tanker, which then struck a car in front and exploded. The ensuing pile-up involved 160 vehicles on a stretch of the motorway, including 30 on the opposite carriageway 20 minutes later. Five air ambulances and 25 ambulances ferried injured drivers and passengers from the scene to three hospitals. A police car was also involved in the pile-up; one firefighter responding to the crash criticised other motorists for overtaking his fire engine in excess of in the dense fog. Several cars and lorries were burnt to a shell and more than 30 occupants had to be cut free from their vehicles by firefighters. Lisa Dodson, a 21-year-old student from Chaddesley Corbett, was the driver of the car, a Peugeot 205, struck by the tanker and she died from asphyxiation. Malcolm MacDonald, 53 and from Redditch, and 63-year-old Margaret Vining, from Gloucester, suffered fatal injuries in the pile-up. Fairclough, then aged 46, suffered bleeding to the brain and leg injuries. In 1999, he was acquitted at Worcester Crown Court of causing death by dangerous driving but convicted of dangerous driving for his role in the collision. His driving licence was suspended for four years and he served three months in Hewell Grange prison. In November 2001 he successfully brought legal action to have the licence reinstated. A judge ordered him to take an extended driving test.

Background  Elector Albrecht Achilles, Predella from St. Gumbertus, Ansbach (1484) Duke Louis the Rich, representation from the 16th century Albert Achilles tried to expand the jurisdiction of his courts, as part of his attempt to extend his influence over neighbouring areas. For this purpose, he tried to raise his Burgraviate Court at Nuremberg to an Imperial Court. This would have given him jurisdiction over the neighbouring principalities and the possibility to override decisions of subordinate courts. He also had in mind a plan to re- establish the Duchy of Franconia, with himself as Duke. The Bishopric of W√ºrzburg had similar plans; neither party managed to implement them. The territory of Duke Louis the Rich of Bavaria-Landshut had recently grown considerably by the incorporation of Bavaria-Ingolstadt.  Alliances  Albert Achilles managed to make a credible case to Emperor Frederick that the Hohenzollern interests in Bavaria happened to coincide with the Imperial interests. After Louis the Rich had created a casus belli by taking the Free Imperial City of Donauw√∂rth, the Emperor outlawed Louis and tasked Albert Achilles with implementing this verdict. Both sides drew in allies with different interests and the conflict spread through southern and central Germany and even the Bohemian King George of Podƒõbrady participated. Among Albert Achilles's allies were Margrave Charles of Baden-Baden, Count Ulrich V of W√ºrttemberg, his brother Elector Frederick II of Brandenburg, the Electorate of Mainz, Duke William III of Saxony, and Landgrave Louis II of Hesse. Among Louis's allies were Elector Palatine Frederick \\"the Victorious\\", also of the House of Wittelsbach, Count Palatine Otto I of Mosbach, and the Prince-Bishops Rudolf von Scherenberg of W√ºrzburg and Philip of Henneberg of Bamberg, and later also the Bohemian King George of Podƒõbrady.  Course of the war  In 1460, it looked like Louis had won: his army had penetrated deep into Albert Achilles's land and forced him to accept the transfer of territory known as the Judgement of Roth. Louis the Rich also attacked the Bishopric of Eichst√§tt under Prince-Bishop John III of Eych, However, in 1461, Albert Achilles had enough allies on his side to be able to reject this judgement. Louis the Rich was still stronger militarily and occupied more land in the Margraviate. The emperor then intervened and tasked the King of Bohemia with negotiating a cease-fire in Prague. Meanwhile, Louis continued to attack neutral cities. He completely destroyed some of them. Two important battles were fought in 1462: the Battle of Seckenheim in June 1462, where Louis's ally Frederick \\"the Victorious\\" managed to take the Imperial captains Charles of Baden-Baden and Ulrich V of W√ºrttemberg captive, and the Battle of Geingen, which was won by Louis.  Aftermath  A compromise was reached: Albert Achilles dropped his claims of imperial jurisdiction and Louis returned the territories he had occupied. Further negotiations in Prague led to a peace treaty. The alliances and results of this war are intertwined with other conflicts fought simultaneously in other parts of Germany, such as the Mainz feud.  Situation in the Sechs√§mterland in 1462  An army from Bohemia and Cheb invaded the Sechs√§mterland in 1462 and caused significant damage by looting and pillaging.Karl Dietel: Hallerstein, Landkreis M√ºnchberg, Schlo√ü, Herrschaft, Kirche und Dorf, in: Archiv f√ºr die Geschichte von Oberfranken The Amtmann, Frederick of Dobeneck, at Thierstein Castle set fire to the village of Thierstein to prevent the enemy troops from entrenching in it. Because he had allowed the villagers of Theirstein to seek refuge in the castle, he was unable to resiste a lengthy siege and had to surrender. The Bohemians went on the capture Hohenberg Castle and burned down the city of Wei√üenstadt. According to legend, Frederick of Sparneck vowed that he would found a monastery if he would be spared the ravages of war. As he was spared, he founded Sparneck Abbey. At the Katharinenberg bei Wunsiedel, Jobst of Schirnding managed to drive the Bohemians back, after a six-week unsuccessful siege of the city. The church on the Katharinenberg was destroyed during the siege and has been a ruin ever since.Dr. Hans Vollet und Kathrin Heckel: Die Ruinenzeichnungen des Plassenburgkartographen Johann Christoph Stierlein, 1987 His success was, however, not the result of military strength -- the invading armies were far stronger -- but due to internal conflicts between the Bohemians and the troops from Eger (Eger region being German speaking and Catholic, while Czech-speaking Bohemians were mostly Hussitic). Several villages in the Eger area were destroyed by the retreating Bohemian army.Elisabeth J√§ger: Wunsiedel 1163‚Äì1560, Wunsiedel, 1987, p. 242 Local sources distinguish between a \\"longer\\" and a \\"closer\\" Hussite raid, thus linking the event to the Hussite Wars.

Retrieved 2011-11-06. Subsequently he worked in exhibition design and theatre design, but also began painting. In 1965 he moved to Pembrokeshire, Wales. Career Knapp-Fisher claimed he painted every day. \\"I tell students to do something every day ‚Äì even if it‚Äôs a quick thumbnail sketch... Rather like a dancer has to practise every day, a painter has to oil the hinges by doing little drawings.\\" He preferred to paint from notes and drawings in his sketchbooks, rather than from photographs. As a result his favorite subjects were local to his studio, for example Porthgain Harbour. Knapp-Fisher's largest exhibition was in Johannesburg, South Africa, where he displayed over 60 paintings. To mark his 80th birthday in August 2011, Knapp-Fisher was featured on the BBC Radio Wales Arts Show. He also held an exhibition of new paintings at the Martin Tinney Gallery in Cardiff. Personal life Knapp-Fisher once spent 5 years living on a boat in East Anglia. He resided in Croesgoch with his partner, Gillian Pare. Knapp-Fisher died at Withybush Hospital, Haverfordwest in February 2015 age 83.

He won fourteen graded stakes races, including eight Grade I stakes: the Santa Anita Handicap in 2011, 2013, and 2014 the only horse to have won that race three times; he also won the Goodwood Stakes twice (2011, 2012), the 2013 Pacific Classic Stakes, and the Hollywood Gold Cup twice (2012, 2013). He has beaten many of the leading North American racehorses including Awesome Gem, Tizway, Ruler on Ice, Uncle Mo, Stay Thirsty, Mucho Macho Man and Will Take Charge and has been rated among the best thirty racehorses in the world in the annual World Thoroughbred Rankings. Upon his retirement, he was compared favorably as one of the greatest racing geldings of all time, along with Kelso, John Henry and Forego. Background Game On Dude is a dark bay gelding with no white markings on his face and pastern-high socks on both hind legs. He was bred by the Adena Springs stud of Paris, Kentucky. He was sired by the 1998 Breeders' Cup Classic winner Awesome Again, whose other major winners include Ghostzapper, Oxbow, Wilko and Paynter. Game On Dude is the second recorded foal of his dam Worldly Pleasure, a mare who won eight of her thirty-one races between 2003 and 2005.http://www.equibase.com/profiles/Results.cfm?type=Horse&refno;=5351118&registry;=T As a descendant of the broodmare Adjournment, Worldly Pleasure was a distant relative of the Preakness Stakes winner Master Derby.http://www.bloodlines.net/TB/Families/Family1L.htm In September 2008 the yearling was sent to the Keeneland but did not meet his reserve price of $210,000. He was later sold privately and sent into training with Bob Baffert. He has been ridden by several leading jockeys including Rafael Bejarano, Chantal Sutherland and Mike E. Smith. The horse often raced with blinkers and a blue shadow roll. Racing career =2010: three-year-old season= Game on Dude in the paddock prior to the Belmont Stakes Unraced as a two-year-old, Game On Dude began his racing career at Gulfstream Park in early 2010, winning a maiden race over one mile at his second attempt. He was then moved up in class to contest three of the preparatory races for the Triple Crown series. After finishing unplaced in the Florida Derby and the Cliff's Edge Derby Trial, he ran in the Grade III Lone Star Derby at Lone Star Park on May 8. Ridden by Martin Garcia, he took the lead in the straight and drew clear of his opponents to record his first significant win by four and a half lengths. Garcia was again in the saddle when Game On Dude started a 17/1 outsider for the Belmont Stakes on June 5. He challenged for the lead early in the straight before finishing fourth of the eleven runners, two and a half lengths behind the winner Drosselmeyer. Game On Dude did not race again in 2010: according to Baffert; \\"He did something to a hind ankle, so I had to stop on him.\\" =2011: four-year-old season= In 2011, Game On Dude ran eight times and won three races, notably the Santa Anita Handicap and the Goodwood Stakes, both at Santa Anita Park. The Santa Anita Handicap, which provided the gelding with his first Grade I win, was a controversial race. Ridden by Sutherland, he prevailed by a nose from Setsuko but had been involved in an incident in which the favorite, Twirling Candy, had been badly hampered. The result was only confirmed after a lengthy steward's inquiry and was met by boos from the crowd. That year, he also finished second in the Hollywood Gold Cup and the Breeders' Cup Classic. =2012: five-year-old season= As a five-year-old, Game On Dude won the San Antonio Stakes, Californian Stakes, Hollywood Gold Cup, Awesome Again Stakes and Native Diver Handicap. He started 5/4 favorite for the Breeders' Cup Classic but finished seventh behind Fort Larned. =2013: six-year-old season= Game on Dude began his six-year-old campaign with consecutive victories in the San Antonio Stakes, Santa Anita Handicap, Charles Town Classic, Hollywood Gold Cup, and Pacific Classic. With his 2013 victories in the Santa Anita Handicap, Hollywood Gold Cup and Pacific Classic, he became the second horse to achieve the \\"California triple crown\\" in a single year. The only other horse to achieve this feat was Lava Man. In the Pacific Classic, where he led from the start, his margin of win was a record 8 1/2 lengths. This was his third try at the Classic. With this win, Game On Dude joined Lava Man's 2006 sweep of all three of Southern California's major handicap races in the same year. This win marked a seven-race win streak, including a 5-for-5 campaign in 2013, and with his latest Grade I win is now the richest active horse in North American racing. The final time recorded in the 2013 Pacific Classic was questioned. According to \\"Trakus Time\\", a company that does timing at many tracks, Game On Dude's winning time was 1:59.26, not the Del Mar official time listed at 2:00.69. However, upon review, officials at Del Mar upheld the official time, which was the third fastest time for the race. He earned a 113 Beyer Speed Figure for his effort. Trainer Baffert was not concerned: \\"As long as they don‚Äôt take the check away, it's good.\\" Entered for a third time in the Breeders' Cup Classic, he was the favorite, but again failed to hit the board, finishing ninth out of 11 horses in the field. In order to help Game On Dude's chances with the Eclipse Award he was entered in the Clark Handicap at Churchill Downs. He was second to Will Take Charge by a head. =2014: seven-year-old season= After a fifth-place finish in the San Antonio Stakes, his first race of the 2014 season,http://www.equibase.com/static/chart/pdf/SA020814USA5.pdf Game On Dude won the Santa Anita Handicap for the third time, beating Will Take Charge, who was second, and Mucho Macho Man, who was fourth. With this win, he became the first-ever three-time winner of the race and broke the stakes record set by Affirmed in 1979. After the gelding's victory, which was achieved in a race record time of 1:58.17, Baffert commented, \\"I was in awe of the horse watching him come down the stretch. What an amazing animal!\\" On his next start, Game On Dude started odds-on favorite to repeat his 2013 success in the Charles Town Classic while conceding five pounds to his opponents and was beaten two and a half lengths by the four-year-old Imperative. In the Gold Cup at Santa Anita, he again started odds-on under top weight and finished fourth behind Majestic Harbour. In the Pacific Classic, Mike Smith opted to ride the unbeaten three- year-old Shared Belief, leaving the ride on Game On Dude to Martin Garcia. Game On Dude took the early lead but was challenged in the early stages by the Argentinian outsider Mystery Train. He maintained his advantage into the straight but faded in the closing stages to finish fourth behind Shared Belief, Toast of New York, and Imperative. Baffert said that the run of Mystery Train had effectively ruined his horse's chances; \\"Longshots are always the biggest danger to a horse like Game on Dude. They always want to go after him. I hate to see that. I think he was gonna win if they hadn't gone after him like that. It's frustrating to train a horse and get him ready for his biggest race and have a horse who has no shot to win take that chance away\\". On September 18, 2014, Baffert announced that Game On Dude would be retired. Discussing the recent tendency of opponents to enter horses with early speed to wear him down and his poor performance in the Pacific Classic, Baffert explained, \\"It's starting to wear on him a little bit to the point where it's not fun for him anymore. We always felt if he couldn't compete at the grade I level and wasn't enjoying what he was doing, it would be time to retire him.\\" His owner, Bernie Schiappa, announced in early October that Game On Dude would spend his retirement at Old Friends Equine, located in Georgetown, Kentucky. Assessment In the 2011 edition of the World Thoroughbred Rankings, Game On Dude was given a rating of 122, making him the twenty-third best racehorse in the world and the fourth best horse trained in the United States. He improved his mark to 123 in 2012, but in 2013 slipped to twenty-fifth in the world and sixth in the United States. Upon his retirement, he was viewed as one of the greatest American racing geldings of all time, compared favorably with Kelso, John Henry and Forego.

They are generally nondescript when not in bloom, but the flowers of most species are incongruously decorative. Overview Microloma R. Br. in Mem. Werner. Soc.1: 53, (1809), is a genus of herbaceous perennial, dicotyledonous plants . Microloma species were originally described as members of the genus Ceropegia, in the family Asclepiadaceae, but Brown separated them and created the new genus, still in the family Asclepiadaceae. More recently the Asclepiadaceae have been re-classified as the subfamily Asclepiadoideae of the dogbane family Apocynaceae. scrub a year earlier. Usually the stems would be twining around the branches of perennials. Microloma calycinum, a species from an arid region Microloma sagittatum in flower, twining in mixed fynbos thicket Common names of Microloma species are various and regional; Manning mentions \\"wax creeper\\" and \\"melktou\\" (literally \\"milk-string\\", a curious name because the plants do not in general produce latex). Other names include \\"wax twiner\\" and \\"bokhorinkies\\" (literally \\"little goat- or antelope-horns, a reference to the shape of the fruit). Marloth said: \\"The Dutch name is suikerkannetje, as the flower produces so much nectar that in the morning one may shake out a drop of it from each flower.\\" Marloth, Rudolf. ‚ÄúThe Flora of South Africa‚Äù 1932 Pub. Cape Town: Darter Bros. London: Wheldon & Wesley. \\"Suikerkannetje\\" means little \\"sugar-can\\". Marloth adds:\\"In spite of this proffered feast, visitors are rare and one must have much patience if one wants to know who the visitors are that respond to the invitation ‚Äî they are small moths and tiny butterflies like the Lycaena or still smaller kinds.\\" More recent work however has shown that such insects are incidental visitors; the main pollinators are sunbirds; the pollinia stick to their tongues in a striking example of specialised mutualism. Microlomas are perennials. Some are delicate twiners and some are shrublets; Microloma massonii (now = Microloma armatum) is so densely branched, with the branches so spiny at their tips, that the colloquial name is \\"ystervarkbossie\\", meaning \\"porcupine bush\\". Unlike many of the Asclepiadoideae Microlomas have clear sap without any conspicuous latex. Their leaves are opposite, usually sessile and simple. The inflorescences are umbel- like cymes, borne outside the axils. The flowers usually are red or reddish, sometimes yellow, orange or pink. There are five sepals, with the corolla usually longer than the calyx. The five petals are usually glossily waxy, consistently with some of the common names. The corolla tube is usually pentagonal and urn-shaped or oblong, with tufts of downward-pointing hairs low down in the tube opposite the lobes. The petals are arranged spirally and practically close the tube. The stamens arise from the base of the corolla. The anthers generally are sagittate at their bases, and bear pollinia.Dyer, R. Allen, ‚ÄúThe Genera of Southern African Flowering Plants‚Äù. , 1975 Most species grow a fascicle of fleshy roots around the base of the stem and thus may shed shoots and leaves in dry seasons or when fires pass over. Traditional uses An infusion of the fleshy root fascicle of Microloma saggittatum has been used in traditional medicine for relief of griping pains in the abdomen. The infusion is red in colour. If water is unavailable the patient may chew a piece of the root instead.Watt, John Mitchell; Breyer-Brandwijk, Maria Gerdina: The Medicinal and Poisonous Plants of Southern and Eastern Africa 2nd ed Pub. E & S Livingstone 1962 Country children would suck the very sweet nectar from the flower clusters of some species. This was rather as a treat or a whim than as a serious contribution to their nutrition, because the plants are small and not usually plentiful. ;SpeciesThe Plant List, genus Microloma # Microloma burchellii N.E.Br. \\\\- South Africa # Microloma calycinum E.Mey. \\\\- near Goedemanskraal in Western Cape Province # Microloma gibbosum N.E.Br. \\\\- South Africa # Microloma glabratum E.Mey. \\\\- Western Cape Province # Microloma hereroense Wanntorp \\\\- Namibia # Microloma incanum Decne.- South Africa # Microloma longitubum Schltr. \\\\- Namibia # Microloma namaquense H.Bol. \\\\- Namibia, Western Cape Province # Microloma penicillatum Schltr. \\\\- Damaraland in Namibia # Microloma poicilanthum Huber \\\\- Damaraland in Namibia # Microloma sagittatum (L.)

The voice is described as a rhythmic krawk-kraw-krawk repeated two or three times. It is the only member of the genus Gymnorhinus. Its overall proportions are very nutcracker-like and indeed this can be seen as convergent evolution as both birds fill similar ecological niches. The pinyon jay is a bluish-grey coloured bird with deeper head colouring and whitish throat with black bill, legs and feet. They are highly social, often forming very large flocks of 250 or more birds, and several birds always seem to act as sentries for the flock, watching out for predators while their companions are feeding. The seed of the pinyon pine is the staple food but they supplement their diet with fruits and berries. Insects of many types are also eaten and sometimes caught with their feet. The nest is always part of a colony but there is never more than one nest in a tree. Sometimes the colony can cover quite extensive areas with a single nest in each tree (usually juniper, live oak or pine). There are usually 3‚Äì4 eggs laid, quite early in the season. Incubation is usually 16 days. The male bird normally brings food near to the nest, and the female flies to him to receive it and take back to the nest to feed the chicks that fledge around 3 weeks later. Young are normally fed only by their parents, but once they reach the near- fledging size they can sometimes receive a meal from any passing member of the colony, which can continue for some time after leaving the nest. The pinyon jay was first collected, recorded, and first described as a species from a specimen shot along the Maria River in Northern Montana during the Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied, Expedition to the Interior of North America in 1833. This species occurs in western North America from central Oregon to northern Baja California and east as far as western Oklahoma though it wanders further afield out of the breeding season. It lives in foothills where the pinyon pines Pinus edulis and Pinus monophylla occur. Taxonomy The pinyon jay was described by German explorer Prince Maximilian of Wied-Neuwied in 1841, from a specimen shot along the Maria River in Northern Montana during his expedition to the Interior of North America in 1833. It is the sole member of the genus Gymnorhinus. No subspecies are recognised. Genetic analysis suggests that the pinyon jay is an offshoot from a lineage that gave rise to the scrub-jays and relatives (Aphelocoma) and Cyanocitta (blue jay and Steller's jay). The International Ornithologists' Union has designated \\"pinyon jay\\" the official common name for the species. It was historically known as the blue crow or Maximilian's jay. Distribution and Habitat Ponderosa forest near Forest Lakes, Arizona. Pinyon jays are residents from central Oregon to western South Dakota, south to northern Baja California, northwestern and east-central Arizona, central New Mexico, and western Oklahoma.American Ornithologists' Union. 2005. The A.O.U. check-list of North American birds, 7th edition They winter throughout their breeding range and irregularly from southern Washington to northwestern Montana, and south to Mexico and central Texas. When pinyon seed crops are poor, pinyon jays may wander to central Washington, northwestern Oregon, northern Idaho, northwestern Montana, throughout the Great Basin, Nebraska, Kansas, central- western and southwestern California, southeastern Arizona, central Texas, and northern Chihuahua. The pinyon jay is casual in Iowa and a sight report exists in Saskatchewan. The pinyon jay is a permanent resident of pinyon-juniper (Pinus-Juniperus spp.) woodlands and low-elevation ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in the southwestern United States. Pinyon-juniper woodlands are composed primarily of Colorado pinyon (P. edulis) and Utah juniper (J. osteosperma) and cover vast acreages in Colorado, northern Arizona, Utah, and Nevada. Other pinyon and juniper species occurring in these woodlands include singleleaf pinyon (P. monophylla), Parry pinyon (P. quadrifolia), Mexican pinyon (P. cembroides), alligator juniper (J. deppeana), Rocky Mountain juniper (J. scopulorum), and California juniper (J. californica).Stuever, Mary C.; Hayden, John S. 1996. Plant associations (habitat types) of the forests and woodlands of Arizona and New Mexico. Final report: Contract R3-95-27. Placitas, NM: Seldom Seen Expeditions, Inc. The pinyon jay relies on singleleaf pinyon in the northwestern portion of its range and Colorado pinyon in the southeastern portion of its range. Ponderosa pines of the southwestern United States include interior ponderosa pine (P. p. var. scopulorum) and Arizona pine (P. p. var. arizonica). In this article, \\"pinyon\\" refers to both Colorado pinyon and singleleaf pinyon, and \\"ponderosa pine\\" refers to interior ponderosa pine and Arizona pine unless otherwise specified. Pinyon jays prefer pinyon-juniper woodlands, and ponderosa pine forests. They interact in a mutual relationship with the pinyon. Pinyon trees provide pinyon jays with food, nesting and roosting sites, and breeding stimuli. Pinyon jays influence seed dispersal, establishment, and genetic structure of pinyon populations. Pinyon jays use Colorado pinyon in the southeastern portion of their range and singleleaf pinyon in the northwestern portion of their range. The Colorado pinyon begins to bear cones at 25 years of age and produces \\"substantial\\" nut crops at an interval of 4 to 7 years, and sometimes every 3 to 5 years. Good cone crops tend to be localized and occur at irregular and infrequent intervals but are geographically synchronous, perhaps to counteract seed predation. Bumper seed crops of the Colorado pinyon are episodic and are probably linked to favorable climatic conditions. Singleleaf pinyon may not produce cones until 35 years of age with a 2- to the 7-year interval between cone production years. The maximum seed production occurs when trees are 75 to 100 years old. =Climate= Pinyon- juniper woodlands are characterized as arid, semiarid, or occasionally, dry subhumid. The mean annual temperature varies from 40 to 61 ¬∞F (4‚Äì16 ¬∞C). The climate of ponderosa pine forests in the western United States is arid to semiarid. Weather is an important factor influencing the breeding success and survival of pinyon jays (see sections Mating and Survival). =Precipitation= The annual mean precipitation in the pinyon-juniper woodlands of the southwestern United States varies widely, depending on elevation, topography, and geography. Precipitation ranges from 10 inches (254 mm) at low elevations to 22 inches (559 mm) at high elevations.Springfield, H. W. 1976. Characteristics and management of southwestern pinyon-juniper ranges: the status of our knowledge. Res. Pap. RM-160. Fort Collins, CO: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station Spring and summer are times of drought, and Colorado pinyon and juniper are highly drought resistant. Snow depths are not great, except at higher elevations and northern latitudes, but even then, melting occurs within a few days, especially on south-facing slopes. Ponderosa pine forests in the western United States experienced extreme variations in precipitation, receiving no snow some years and up to 100 inches (2,540 mm) in other years. Heavy spring snowfall in both habitats can create difficult nesting conditions for pinyon jays. =Elevation= Pinyon-juniper woodlands occur on foothills, mesas, plateaus and low mountains from 4,000 to 8,000 feet (1,219‚Äì2,438 m) elevation.Gottfried, Gerald J. 1999. Pinyon-juniper woodlands in the southwestern United States. In: Ffolliott, Peter F.; Ortega-Rubio, Alfredo, eds. Ecology and management of forests, woodlands, and shrublands in the dryland regions of the United States and Mexico: perspectives for the 21st century. Co-edition No. 1. Tucson, AZ: The University of Arizona; La Paz, Mexico: Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas del Noroeste, SC; Flagstaff, AZ: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station: 53‚Äì67 Ponderosa pine forests in the western United States are most common from 6,000 to 8,500 feet (1,800‚Äì2,600). Pinyon jays have been noted foraging with Clark's nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana) at elevations up to 11,500 feet (3,505 m) in northern Arizona. =Soil= Pinyon-juniper woodlands occur in areas with a wide range of soils,Gottfried, Gerald J. 1987. Regeneration of pinyon. In: Everett, Richard L., compiler. Proceedings‚Äîpinyon- juniper conference; 1986 January 13‚Äì16; Reno, NV. Gen. Tech. Rep. INT-215. Ogden, UT: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Intermountain Research Station: 249‚Äì254 with parent materials composed of limestone, lava, and sandstone. Soil textures range from coarse, rocky gravels to fine, compacted clays. Ponderosa pine forests in the western United States occur on igneous and sedimentary parent materials including basalt, volcanic cinder, limestone, and sandstone. Conifer seeds are buried by pinyon jays in areas sparsely covered with vegetation, with patches of bare soil and rocks, indicating well-drained soil. Behavior Pinyon jays are noisy groups, though they may form large of more than 250 to 500 members as they are watching out for predators while their companions are feeding seeds. They spend most of their time searching for seeds to be eaten on the spot, hide in the ground, or store in tree crevice to eat later. They utilize pinyon, western juniperShort, Henry L.; McCulloch, Clay Y. 1977. Managing pinyon- juniper ranges for wildlife. Gen. Tech. Rep. RM-47. Fort Collins, CO: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Forest and Range Experiment Station and ponderosa pine trees for cover. Roosting sites rarely occur in the last area that was used for foraging that day. Before roosting, a flock of pinyon jays in northern Arizona flew 1 to 3 miles (1.6‚Äì4.8 km) from the feeding site. Roosting birds clumped together in groups of 3 to 5 individuals. =Mating= Pinyon Jay in Desert View Watchtower on its habitat. Pinyon jays form large flocks that are maintained in a variety of forms throughout the year. The breeding season during January and February is the only time of the year when the composition of the flock changes dramatically. Two flocks are formed, 1 with breeding birds and 1 with yearling non-breeding birds. A 3rd flock may form at this time, composed of breeding pairs that were unsuccessful in their 1st breeding attempt in order to try a 2nd breeding attempt. Despite separation into separate flocks at times, a high degree of sociality continues to be maintained. Pinyon jays appear to form perennial, monogamous pair bonds Marzluff, John M.; Russell P. Balda. 1988. Resource and climatic variability: influences on the sociality of two southwestern corvids. In: Slobodchikoff, C. N., ed. The ecology of social behavior. [Publication location unknown]: Academic Press, Inc.: pp. 255‚Äì283 that last an average of 2.5 years. Breeding is initiated in males and females at 2 years and 1.56 years of age, respectively. Males average 1.63 mates/lifetime and females average 1.43 mates/lifetime. Pinyon-juniper woodlands and ponderosa pine forests are utilized for reproduction. Pinyon jays are stimulated by increased photoperiod length and begin breeding in January or early February. Breeding may occur again in August based on the abundance of green Colorado pinyon cones and seeds, which stimulates and accelerates the growth of testes. Breeding activities from nest-building to the feeding of fledglings are related to the availability of conifer seeds and have been recorded for every month except December. Reproductive success may be maximized following large Colorado pinyon seed crops. These seed crops ripen at the end of August and enable pinyon jays to cache plenty of seeds and therefore breed sooner in the year, typically beginning in January. In years when bumper crops of pinyon seeds are available, pinyon jays have the opportunity to breed twice, in January or February and again in August. When the pinyon crop fails, pinyon jays forego late-winter breeding and instead breed in August when crops of pinyon seeds are ripe. \\"Courtship parties\\", consisting of all adult birds in the flock, are formed. Pinyon jays in these \\"courtship parties\\" fly several miles away from the group foraging area to breed in a colony. A flock of 250 pinyon jays was studied in a ponderosa pine forest and adjacent pinyon-juniper woodland for 2.5 years near Flagstaff, Arizona. During January or February, the make-up of the pinyon jay flock changed dramatically as courtship activities increased. The flock was together in the early morning for foraging, then \\"courtship parties\\" flew up to 900 feet (274 m) away from the feeding flock for courtship activities. Courting pairs left and re-entered the main flock throughout the day. =Nesting= Nesting occurs from late February to April. Food availability is an important factor in the selection of nesting grounds. Nest building takes place in loose colonies and is synchronized among pairs in the \\"courtship party\\". During nesting, breeding pairs of birds roost with the main flock and feed as a unit for 1.5 hours each morning. Nests are built in pinyon, western juniper (J. occidentalis), or ponderosa pine trees and are composed of twigs and shredded bark. Pinyon jays living in urban areas of Flagstaff, Arizona, were observed building their nests from trash, paper, and synthetic materials. Nests were built an average height of 18.4 feet (5.6 m) off of the ground in ponderosa pine trees with large amounts of cover above. Nests are built 50 to 500 feet (15‚Äì152 m) apart from each other. Pinyon jays appear to be highly adaptive. For example, one study concluded that pinyon jays learned to modify their nest site location based on prior experience. Following at least 2 encounters with predators, pinyon jays learned to avoid building their nests in exposed areas of trees. Pinyon jays 7 or more years old learned to nest at low heights, enhancing concealment, and built their nests further out from the trunk early in the season in order to increase solar warming and reduce the energy costs of incubation. Females typically incubate 3 to 5 eggs. Clutches measured in Flagstaff, Arizona, commonly contained 4 eggs, but in some years over 40% of all nests contained 3 or fewer eggs. Large clutches of 4 or more eggs were more common in years of abundant Colorado pinyon seeds. During incubation, males leave the females and form their own feeding flock. Incubating females are fed pinyon and ponderosa pine seeds by their mates. Marzluff and Balda found that females were fed at a rate of about once every 73 minutes during incubation. Eggs are typically incubated for 17 days before hatching. In a ponderosa pine forest near Flagstaff, Arizona, pairs of birds not successful in their 1st nesting attempt formed satellite nesting colonies composed of 3 to 12 nests in late April. These satellite colonies were scattered up to 0.75 miles (1.2 km) in all directions from the initial nesting location. Nest success increased with successive attempts; however, the number of young fledged per nest did not increase. =Fledging= In one study, the fledging of all young pinyon jays occurred no more than 6 days apart from different nests due to the synchronization of breeding. To protect fledglings from the cold, females remained on the nests continuously, and females and young were fed regurgitated ponderosa pine seeds. No more than 2 male birds fed nestlings for the first 12 to 15 days following hatching. Up to 7 adult male birds, probably sons of the nesting pair from the previous year, cooperatively fed nestlings during the last 4 days of nestling life and 20 days after leaving the nest. Some adult pinyon jays that were unsuccessful in their 1st and/or 2nd nesting attempts have been seen assuming a parental role for other young birds. Young pinyon jays fledge approximately 3 weeks following hatching. Eight days after leaving the nest, the young learn to feed themselves a diet of mainly insects and soft plants. Pinyon seeds and ponderosa pine seeds are eaten as a reserve food. The fledgling's parents continue to feed them for up to 1 month, but at a reduced rate. Immature pinyon jays become independent at 8 weeks. After fledging, adults and young form a tightly knit feeding group until late summer. In the fall, juveniles of both sexes either become permanent members of the flock that they were born into, or leave to become members of other flocks. Young females usually leave their natal flock to find mates in new flocks and males stay with their natal flock to either breed or help their parents to breed. =Predators= Predation can be high for pinyon jays; however, flocking, colonial nesting, and mobbing may deter predators. In a study by Balda and Bateman, near Flagstaff, Arizona, 4‚Äì12 pinyon jays of a flock acted as sentinels, positioned at a high vantage point in a tree, waiting silently for an intruder while the flock was feeding. If an intruder approached, a warning call caused the flock to cease feeding and hide in the trees. Pinyon jays have been seen mobbing great horned owls (Bubo virginianus), sharp-shinned hawks (Accipiter striatus), Cooper's hawks (A. cooperii), red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), and common gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus). In a study conducted in Flagstaff, Arizona, 122 pinyon jays nests were located and studied between 1981 and 1986. The percentages of identified predation events on pinyon jays were: ravens and crows (Corvus spp.) 76.2%; Steller's jays, Abert's squirrels (Sciurus aberti), and rock squirrels (Spermophilus variegatus) 18.0%; ground predators including snakes, gray foxes, and domestic cats (Felis silvestris) 4.1%; and accipiters 1.6%. Mexican spotted owls (Strix occidentalis lucida) have also been seen consuming pinyon jays.Stuart, John D. 1987. Fire history of an old-growth forest of Sequoia sempervirens (Taxodiaceae) forest in Humboldt Redwoods State Park, California. Madrono. 34(2): 128‚Äì141 Incubating females are sometimes pulled from their nests at night. Female pinyon jays may be vulnerable to nocturnal and diurnal predators because they are extremely reluctant to leave their nests. Because pinyon jays breed in loose colonies, a predator attuned to finding nests could potentially specialize on incubating or brooding females. =Survival= Pinyon jay in flight In general, adults have a better chance of survival than yearlings and yearlings have a better chance of survival than juveniles. Nest failure is \\"high\\" during years when pinyons do not produce seeds. Breeding during late winter and early spring can produce fewer young that survive to maturity except in years following a major pinyon seed crop. Breeding for the 2nd time in August or September may result in high mortality of nestlings if the weather deteriorates rapidly in the late fall. Marzluff and Balda studied 708 pinyon jays in Flagstaff, Arizona, from 1972‚Äì1984. The heaviest mortality of pinyon jays occurred in the fall, perhaps due to increased foraging activity in relatively unfamiliar areas, associated with the pinyon seed harvest. An average of 74% of adults, 62% of yearlings, and 41% of juveniles survived each year. Female pinyon jays experienced lower survivorship than males, perhaps because they perform the incubation and brooding. In another study by Marzluff and Balda in Flagstaff, Arizona, survivorship of all age classes of pinyon jays was more strongly correlated with the weather than with pinyon seed crop variations. Juveniles and yearlings had a better chance of survival when spring weather was warm and wet and pinyon crops were large compared to snowy springs and poor pinyon seed crops. Adults survived better during warm, wet, spring weather also but experienced the highest survival during intermediate versus large pinyon seed crops. This may have been due to increased activity during harvest in large seed crop years and increased exposure to predators. Following a study of 2 pinyon jay flocks near Flagstaff, Arizona, Clark, and Gabaldon suggested that nest desertions by adults may be a response to low-temperature thermal stress of nestlings. Broods too young to thermoregulate may die from low-temperature thermal stress when left unattended. This thermal stress may be responsible for nest desertions before the chicks die. Nest desertion may also occur following partial depredation of the nest because of the high probability that a predator may return. Food habits Pinyon jays are morphologically and behaviorally specialized to exploit pinyon seeds for food. Pinyon seeds are heavy and wingless, and not suited for wind dissemination. Their dispersal requires birds, animals, and humans. The seeds of the Colorado pinyon and singleleaf pinyon are very nutritious. Colorado pinyon seeds contain 14% protein, 62% to 71% fat, and 18% carbohydrate. Singleleaf pinyon seeds contain 10% protein, 23% fat, and 54% carbohydrate. Both contain all of the amino acids and abundant phosphorus, iron, vitamin A, and other nutrients. Pinyon cones require 3 growing seasons to mature; however, seeds within 1-year-old green cones can be eaten by the pinyon jay and are ripe by the end of August. Each cone contains approximately 20 seeds. Ponderosa pine seeds are also an important food for the pinyon jay. In addition to pinyon and ponderosa pine seeds, pinyon jays eat Rocky Mountain bristlecone pine (Pinus aristata) seeds, limber pine (P. flexilis) seeds, and juniper berries. Insects such as caterpillar (Lepidoptera) larvae, beetles (Coleoptera), grasshoppers (Orthoptera), and ants (Hymenoptera) make up a large portion of their diet. Spiders (Araneae) are commonly eaten, and cultivated grains including corn, sorghum, beans, barley, oats, and wheat are consumed during winter months. Pinyon jays have also been noted ingesting soil around salt blocks for cattle. Nestlings eat insects,Lanner, Ronald M. 1996. The pine birds. In: Lanner, Ronald M. Made for each other: a symbiosis of birds and pines. New York: Oxford University Press: pp. 32‚Äì37 soft plants, and pinyon seeds when they are plentiful. =Foraging behavior= Pinyon jays form flocks of 50 to more than 500 and occasionally thousands of individuals, that begin to forage together in late August. Flocking may be an adaptive strategy to increase search efficiency and reduce predation. Pinyon jays must travel long distances in search of cones during years when almost no pinyon or ponderosa pine cones are produced in an area. Different flocks may criss-cross each other within an area and keep in contact with vocalizations. Flocks are sometimes formed with the hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus), downy woodpecker (P. pubescens), northern flicker (Coloptes auratus), Clark's nutcracker, and European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) for a portion of the year, but these species are not important for the maintenance of the flock. The benefits of interspecific flocking are probably for protection from predators during feeding and to assist in locating locally abundant but scattered food. Pinyon jays forage on the ground and in dead, fallen trees for insects and cached seeds. They also forage in the crevices of live trees for cached pinyon seeds, feed on the tips of ponderosa pine branches where new growth has occurred, and forage in the canopy for pinyon and ponderosa pine cones. If a cone is ripe but closed, the pinyon jay removes it to a place where it can be held open with the bird's feet. Then the bird hammers the cone open with its bill. Pinyon jays can differentiate between filled and empty seeds by a combination of color, weight, and the sound produced by clicking seeds with their bills. Pinyon jays can hold up to 43 ponderosa pine seeds and 56 pinyon seeds in their expandable esophagus. =Caching= Cached seeds provide energy for gonad development, courtship, nest building, egg laying and incubation. Pinyon jays travel up to 7.5 miles (12 km) to cache pinyon and ponderosa pine seeds for later use.Lanner, Ronald M. (1981). The pinon pine: A natural and cultural history. Reno, NV: University of Nevada Press . Seed caching is most common in the fall. Cached Colorado pinyon seeds comprise up to 90% of the pinyon jay's diet from November through February. One to 7 seeds are placed in each cache, and a single pinyon jay can cache more than 20,000 seeds in 1 season. A flock of pinyon jays in New Mexico was estimated to cache 4.5 million seeds in 1 year. Pinyon jays may recache seeds to avoid seed theft by Steller's jays (Cyanocitta stellerii). Seeds are cached on and off of the ground, depending on the season. Seeds are cached on the ground in areas with sparse vegetation and exposed, well-drained soils. Seeds are buried in the litter of dead needles and twigs, and between organic material and mineral soil. Seeds are cached close to the trunk of trees, most often on the south side where snow melts most quickly.Balda, Russell P. 1987. Avian impacts on pinyon-juniper woodlands. In: Everett, Richard L., compiler. Proceedings‚Äîpinyon-juniper conference; 1986 January 13‚Äì16; Reno, NV. Gen. Tech. Rep. INT-215. Ogden, UT: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Intermountain Research Station: 525‚Äì533 Ground-caching stops when snow covers the ground. Pinyon jays have been observed caching a significantly (P<0.01) greater number of seeds in above-ground sites during winter. Most seeds were cached in the crevices of tree bark. This was probably due to cold ground temperatures and snow accumulation. A flock of pinyon jays occupying residential areas near Flagstaff, Arizona, was observed removing and caching sunflower seeds, Colorado pinyon seeds, peanuts, and millet from bird feeders. Pinyon jays can remember specific locations where their conspecifics cached seeds for at least 2 days. They can remember general locations of cached seeds for at least 7 days. Observational spatial memory may have evolved as a consequence of cache dependence, as a consequence of caching in flocks, and/or a combination of the two. =Diet due to season= Pinyon jays forage mainly on pinyon seeds in late summer Marzluff, J. M.; Balda, R. P. 1990. Pinyon jays: making the best of a bad situation by helping. In: Stacey, Peter B.; Koenig, Walter D., eds. Cooperative breeding in birds. Cambridge; New York: Cambridge University Press: pp. 197‚Äì238 and ponderosa pine seeds in fall and early winter. A flock of pinyon jays in Flagstaff, Arizona, spent 80% of their time foraging in ponderosa pine forests in late November and early December, and 20% of their time foraging in both an open meadow dominated by grasses and forbs and pinyon-juniper woodlands. When the snow was present in the meadow, the flock spent 60% of its time in the pinyon-juniper woodlands where snow seldom covered the ground. In the fall and winter, pinyon jays have been noted eating Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) acorns in Gambel oak communities in New Mexico, Utah, and Arizona.Leidolf, Andreas; Wolfe, Michael L.; Pendleton, Rosemary L. 2000. Bird communities of gamble oak: a descriptive analysis. Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-48. Fort Collins, CO: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station Status The Pinyon jay is listed as a species of Vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Between 1859 and 1880, it is estimated to 400,000 and 525,000 of pinyon woodlands was mostly used for mine construction and production of the charcoal. Between 1950 and 1964, an estimated 3 million acres of pinyon woodlands were used, this led to millions of Pinyon jays that may have died. Pinyon Jay is probably based mainly on climate impacts on pinyon-juniper habitats and management practices that may impact habitat quality, These impacts and predictions have increased concern over the future of the vulnerability of Pinyon Jay. Across the West, thinning, fire and chemical treatment of pinyon-juniper woodlands have increasingly been used to reduce potential wildfire risk on them or to improve biodiversity or ecological condition, this led to Pinyon Jays stopped nesting within the thinned areas of a traditional nesting colony. A human development such as oil and gas wells may affect Pinyon Jays as they tend to avoid nesting near the developments, and also an unknown decline of insect populations worldwide.

The Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb then ordered Ghazi ud-Din Khan Feroze Jung I to protect the supply routes leading to Jinji Fort and to support and provide reinforcements to Zulfiqar Ali Khan when needed. The Siege of Jinji, was also the longest siege by any single Mughal Army in recorded history, it lasted for a lingering 8 years. Background Jinji Fort itself was under the control of the Adil Shahis of Bijapur since the year 1649. Until in the year 1677, Sivaji, routed the Bijapur forces and captured Jinji Fort. The fort itself was chosen as a hideout for the Maratha leader Rajaram and his allies Santaji Ghorpade and Dhanaji Jadhav. Outraged by the deaths of the Mughal Sowars in the region the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb dispatched Zulfiqar Ali Khan to besiege and capture the massive Jinji Fort. But besieging the fort was no easy task. It enclosed an area of 7 km2 (2.7 sq mi), and its walls were 30 ft high and 66 ft thick. It is elevated 800 ft (240 m) high, and protected by an 80 feet (24 m) wide moat. There were three very important hills within the fort and a large pond containing fresh water.Gingee in the Mughal-Maratha wars Encirclement of Jinji Fort Immediately after encircling the fort in the year 1690, with his Mughal Sowars and Zamburak, Zulfiqar Ali Khan placed Swarup Singh and young Mehboob Khan (a Tamil Muslim nicknamed Maavuthukaran) in command of the Sepoys. Daud Khan was appointed Mir Atish or lead gunner of 60 cannon placed at various locations. Fatah Muhammad was the lead commander of the Rocket artillery consisting of 50 men. Muslim Mappila and Tamils were recruited and good relations were established with Ali Raja Ali II. Zulfiqar Ali Khan then ordered the Maratha to surrender but Rajaram refused and the bombardments began but with little success. Desperately searching for a quick victory Zulfiqar Ali Khan made all efforts to gather men, ammunition and money for a successful war with them. He even allied himself with Fort St. George's English Governor Elihu Yale. In the coming years Zulfiqar Ali Khan would attempt to breach the walls with limited resources he managed to protect the trade routes and make contact with Ghazi ud-Din Khan Feroze Jung I on many occasions. He defended nearby land owners, and led four massive assaults upon the Marathas inside the fort. However, most of his focus was towards the vicinity of the fort and he continuously expected and correctly predicted Maratha ambushes instead of besieging the fort itself. Zulfikhar Ali Khan was briefly joined by Aurangzeb's son Prince Muhammad Kam Baksh. On one occasion when the Mughal encampments around Jinji fort were surrounded by the Maratha rebels, actually decided to defect his plans were foiled and was put to chains and imprisoned in a ditch which was covered by a tent by Zulfikhar Ali Khan, who managed to expel the roving Marathas with Matchlocks. Zulfikhar Ali Khan then wrote a letter informing the Mughal Emperor of his son's betrayal, Aurangzeb then sent his trusted vizier Asad Khan to retrieve Prince Muhammad Kam Baksh. Asad Khan arrived with the finest weapons, carriages and thousands of reinforcements. When Prince Muhammad Kam Baksh, was brought in chains before Aurangzeb, the Mughal Emperor almost had him beheaded, but Aurangzeb was deterred by the pleas of his own daughter Zinat-un-nissa. Queen Mangammal had realized that the renegade Rajaram had entrenched himself within Jinji and had been bent upon attacking Thanjavur and Madurai if the Mughal Army was to withdraw. Mangammal soon recognized Aurangzeb as her suzerain and began to assist Zulfikhar Ali Khan. Zulfikhar Ali Khan then set up a base in Wandiwash. In 1697 Zulfikhar Ali Khan led 18,000 men from his camp (8000 Sowars and 10,000 Sepoys) in order to fight an assembling Maratha force in Tanjore sent by Shivaji II and Ramchandra Pant Amatya and possibly aided by the Madurai Nayaks, consisting of over 40,000 men, with the objective to relieve the siege of Jinji Fort and continue their hostilities against the Mughal Empire. Zulfikhar Ali Khan and his considerably smaller battalion then defeated the ill-equipped Maratha and routed them. Because Zulfikhar Ali Khan did not often receive assistance and supplies from the Mughals he began to forage the countryside in order to recover his losses. In 1697 Rajaram offered to negotiate, but Aurangzeb ordered Zulfikhar Ali Khan to initiate an all-out assault. Zulfikhar Ali Khan returned he made efforts to hire European gunners and then led his final fourth assault into Jinji Fort in the year 1698. Forced into action, the Mughal Army battered the walls with cannon fire, which eventually allowed them to scale the walls and capture the lower citadels, which were armed with cannons that bombarded the higher citadel. After heavy bombardments the Mughals captured the higher citadel. Zulfikhar Ali Khan captured four of Rajaram's wives, three sons and two daughters, while Rajaram himself fled. Aftermath According to Mughal accounts Zulfikhar Ali Khan named Jinji Fort, \\"Nusratgarh\\" after its capture, but the condemned Maratha leader Rajaram had somehow escaped earlier on during the siege, causing much dismay for Zulfikhar Ali Khan. However, the Mughal rule at Jinji eventually paving way to the establishment of the Nawab of the Carnatic and the Sultanate of Mysore. But according to Hindu accounts: it was due to the efforts of Swarup Singh of Bundela, that the Mughals were successful, the Mughal Emperor Aurangazeb, himself granted Swarup Singh a position of Mansabdar of 2,500 and gave him total command and administration of Jinji Fort in 1700 AD. But after Sawrup Singh died of old age in 1714, his newly arriving son De Singh was given command according to an official Firman by the Mughal Emperor Jahandar Shah. This action was considered outrageous to Muhammed Saadatullah Khan I who personally marched to Jinji Fort with 18,000 men and killed De Singh and declared himself the administrator of Jinji Fort.

It was applied as early as 1366 in The Provost of Beverly's CaseY.B. 40 Ed. 3, f9, 18 but in its present form is derived from Shelley's Case (1581),1 Co.Rep. 93b (1581) in which counsel stated the rule as follows: The rule was reported by Lord Coke in England in the 17th century as well-settled law. In England, it was abolished by the Law of Property Act 1925.Law of Property Act 1925 (15 & 16 Geo. 5 c.20), s131 During the twentieth century, it was abolished in most common law jurisdictions, including the majority of the states of the United States. However, in states where the abrogation has been interpreted to apply only to conveyances made after abrogation, the relevance of the rule today varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and in many states remains unclear. The rule is still in operation in all Canadian jurisdictions with the exception of Quebec, which uses civil law, and Manitoba, though it has made an appearance in case law only a few times in the last century. History The litigation was brought about because of a settlement made by Sir William Shelley (1480‚Äì1549), an English judge, on an estate he purchased when Sion Monastery was dissolved. The decision was rendered by Lord Chancellor Sir Thomas Bromley, who presided over an assembly of all the judges on the King's Bench to hear the case during Easter term 1580‚Äì81. The rule existed in English common law long before this case was brought to the court, but Shelley's Case gave the law its most famous application. Issue When an owner of land in fee simple died, the lord of the fee was entitled to \\"incidents of tenure\\" deriving from the descent to the heir (analogous to the modern day estate tax). Large landowners who desired the life tenant (who was perhaps the landowner himself, conveying through a straw party) to avoid the estate tax attempted to create a future interest in the form of a remainder in the heirs of that life tenant. It was the intention of the landowner or testator to allow the heirs of the life tenant, once ascertained at the natural expiration of his life estate, to take as purchasers by way of the original executed conveyance, and not by descent, avoiding the tax. Thus, in a basic conveyance, \\"O grants Blackacre to B for life, then to B's heirs,\\" absent the rule there was a life estate in B, and a contingent remainder in B's heirs. The rule converted the contingent remainder in B's heirs into a vested remainder in B. The rule's effect ended there. After that, the doctrine of merger operated on the two successive freehold estates placed in the same purchaser (B's life estate and B's remainder in fee simple) and converted them into a single fee simple absolute in B. B's heirs, necessarily ascertained only at B's death, Thus, a conveyance to B for life, then to B's children, where B has living children C, D, and E, does not violate the rule because the class members are ascertained, and new ascertained members may join the class so long as B, the class member producer, lives (plus nine months if he is male). Example Suppose Joe has a rich parent named \\"Grandpa\\" who considers Joe careless and imprudent, but who wishes to ensure that Joe's children are provided for. Grandpa might try to deed a house \\"to Joe for life, and then to Joe's heirs\\", thus ensuring that Joe and his family could live in the house, but Joe could not sell it to pay gambling debts. The \\"remaindermen\\" in this case are the grandchildren. The Rule in Shelley's Case states that, this language notwithstanding, Joe is the absolute owner of the property. The rule generalized Simply stated, the rule deals with remainders in the transfer of real property by deed. A remainder is a right \\"carved out\\" of the fee simple which has some future interest so that, at some later date, the holder of the remainder (the future interest) would have ownership rights in the property and those future rights would have to be preserved. The rights could not be sold. It has been explained as an attempt to prevent the sale of property once transferred by putting such limiting words in the deed of transfer. It is a classic example of common law legal reasoning and the logic involved in the interpretation of legal text which is why it continues to be an important teaching tool in the study of the common law. However, while it is an important interpretation tool, it should not be confused with a rule of construction (such as the Doctrine of worthier title) as it is a rule of law. The distinction is that a rule of law cannot be overcome by proof of the grantor's intent, while a rule of construction can be. Analysis Some scholars, such as John V. Orth, believe that this explanation (to promote the right to transfer the land) of the origin of the rule is inaccurate. In their view, the rule originated as the courts' response to an estate-planning technique in the 14th century, long before the litigation in Shelley's Case. A tax known as the \\"relief\\" had to be paid to the feudal lord (the Crown) when a tenant's heir inherited the land. To avoid this estate tax, if the grant to the land were framed in term of a life estate in the grantee followed by a remainder in the grantee's heirs, then upon the grantee's death his heirs would not inherit the land, but received it as a vested remainder. As a consequence, the heir would take the land without having to pay the relief. The courts could not abide such a transparent attempt to circumvent the tax system, and the rule was invented to deal with this problem by converting these transfers into fees simple absolute so as to allow the relief to be collected upon the grantee's death. Later, when the relief was abolished, the rule continued to survive in the common law due to inertia (\\"it is the genius of the common law to add, but not to subtract\\"), the \\"promote the right to transfer the land\\" explanation was concocted to explain the continued existence of the rule. It is not at all uncommon for rules of common law, once their original motivation falls away, to acquire a new justification, and in the process also, sometimes, a new meaning. Many examples of such processes are given in Oliver Wendell Holmes's The Common Law.

Although conditions were harsh, research suggests that thousands lived there between about 1700 and the 1860s. Harriett Beecher Stowe told the maroon people's story in her 1856 novel Dred: A Tale of the Great Dismal Swamp. The most significant research on the settlements began in 2002 with a project by Dan Sayers of American University.  History  Osman, a Great Dismal Swamp Maroon, by David Hunter Strother (Harper‚Äôs New Monthly Magazine, 1856) The first enslaved Africans brought to the British colonies in Virginia in 1619 arrived on the frigate White Lion, a British privateer ship flying under a Dutch flag. The approximately 20 Africans, from the present-day Angola, had been seized by its crew from a Portuguese slave ship, the \\"S√£o Jo√£o Bautista\\".https://www.nationalgeographic.com/archaeology-and- history/magazine/2019/07-08/virginia-first-africans-transatlantic-slave- trade/, 400 years ago, enslaved Africans first arrived in Virginiahttps://time.com/5653369/august-1619-jamestown-history/, The First Africans in Virginia Landed in 1619. The enslaved Africans in British North America were legally deemed to be indentured servants, since slave laws were not passed until later, in 1641 in Massachusetts and in 1661 in Virginia, for example.https://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/feature/indentured-servants- in-the-us/, Indentured Servants In The U.S. As servants, they were entitled to freedom with the passage of a certain period of time; they were also allowed to purchase freedom.https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/horrible-fate- john-casor-180962352/#TewjfFASFy7jWzhh.99, The Horrible Fate of John Casor, The First Black Man to be Declared Slave for Life in America Others gained freedom by converting to Christianity, since the English of that time did not typically enslave Christians. Slave labor was used in many efforts to drain and log the Great Dismal Swamp during the 18th and 19th centuries. People who escaped slavery living in freedom came to be known as maroons or outlyers. Maroonage, runaway slaves in isolated or hidden settlements, existed in all the Southern states, and swamp-based maroon communities existed in the Deep South, in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and South Carolina. Maroonage in the Upper South was largely limited to Virginia and the Great Dismal Swamp. The origin of the term \\"maroon\\" is uncertain, with competing theories linking it to Spanish, Arawak or Taino root words. In all likelihood, the words \\"Maroon\\" and \\"Seminole\\" share the same etymology in the Spanish word cimarr√≥n, meaning \\"wild\\" or \\"untamed\\". This word usually referred to runaways or castaways and is ultimately derived from the word for \\"thicket\\" in Old Spanish.http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Seminole At the beginning of the 18th century, maroons came to live in the Great Dismal Swamp. Most settled on mesic islands, the high and dry parts of the swamp. Inhabitants included people who had purchased their freedom as well as those who had escaped. Other people used the swamp as a route on the Underground Railroad as they made their way further north. Some formerly enslaved lived there in semi-free conditions, but how much independence they actually enjoyed there has been a topic of much debate. Nearby whites often left maroons alone so long as they paid a quota in logs or shingles, and businesses may have ignored the fugitive status of people who provided work in exchange for trade goods. Herbert Aptheker stated already in 1939, in \\"Maroons Within the Present Limits of the United States\\", that likely \\"about two thousand Negroes, fugitives, or the descendants of fugitives\\" lived in the Great Dismal Swamp, trading with white people outside the swamp. Results of a study published in 2007, \\"The Political Economy of Exile in the Great Dismal Swamp\\", say that thousands of people lived in the swamp between 1630 and 1865, Native Americans, maroons and enslaved laborers on the canal. A 2011 study speculated that thousands may have lived in the swamp between the 1600s and 1860. While the precise number of maroons who lived in the swamp at that time is unknown, it is believed to have been one of the largest maroon colonies in the United States. It is established that \\"several thousand\\" were living there by the 19th century. Fear of slave unrest and fugitive slaves living among maroon population caused concern amongst local whites. A militia with dogs went into the swamp in 1823 in an attempt to remove the maroons and destroy their community, but most people escaped. In 1847, North Carolina passed a law specifically aimed at apprehending the maroons in the swamp. However, unlike other maroon communities, where local militias often captured the residents and destroyed their homes, those in the Great Dismal Swamp mostly avoided capture or the discovery of their homes. Little is known of Native American activity in the area prior to 1600, though the presence of hunting bolas indicates that the area may have served as a hunting ground as far back as 5,000 years ago. Native American communities were already in existence in the swamp when the maroons began to settle there. Because leaving the area could inevitably lead to recapture, the inhabitants often used what was readily available in the swamp, even recycling tool remnants left by Native Americans. Since the maroons had few possessions, the few small artifacts that have been recovered have given historians little insight into their day-to-day lives. To date, excavation has yet to find any human remains. According to Sayers, historical archaeologist at American University who has led research on the maroons of the swamp, it is possible that the acidity of the water disintegrated any bones which may have been left behind. Some maroons were born to those who escaped slavery and lived in the swamp for their entire lives despite the hardships of swamp life: dense underbrush, insects, venomous snakes, and bears. The difficult conditions also made the swamp an ideal hiding place, not just for the formerly enslaved but also for free blacks, slaves who worked on the swamp's canals, Native Americans, and outcast whites such as criminals. Maroons are known to have often interacted with slaves and poor whites to obtain work, food, clothes, and money. Some maroons plundered nearby farms and plantations, stole from anchored boats, and robbed travelers on nearby roads; those caught were tried for murder or theft. Some maroon communities were set up near the Dismal Swamp Canal, built between 1793‚Äì1805 and still in operation. These maroons interacted more with the outside world than those who lived in the swamp's interior, and had more contact with outsiders once canal construction began. Some took jobs on the canal, and with increased contact with the outside world, some people living in the swamp eventually moved away. During the American Civil War, the United States Colored Troops entered the swamp to liberate the people there, many of whom then joined the Union Army. Most of the maroons who remained in the swamp left after the Civil War.  Location  The Great Dismal Swamp spans an area of southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina between the James River near Norfolk, Virginia, and the Albemarle Sound near Edenton, North Carolina. The swamp is estimated to have originally been over , but human encroachment has destroyed up to 90% of the swampland. Today, the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge is just over .  References in literature and art In 1842, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote the poem \\"The Slave In Dismal Swamp\\" for his collection Poems on Slavery. The poem uses six quintain stanzas to tell about the \\"hunted Negro\\", mentioning the use of bloodhounds and describing the conditions as being \\"where hardly a human foot could pass, or a human heart would dare\\". The poem may have inspired artist David Edward Cronin, who served as a Union officer in Virginia and witnessed the effect of slavery, to paint Fugitive Slaves in the Dismal Swamp, Virginia in 1888. In 1856, Harriet Beecher Stowe, the author of Uncle Tom's Cabin, published her second anti-slavery novel, Dred: A Tale of the Great Dismal Swamp. The title character is a maroon of the Great Dismal Swamp who preaches against slavery and incites slaves to escape.  Research  The Great Dismal Swamp Landscape Study began in 2002 and was led by Dan Sayers, a historical archaeologist at American University's Department of Anthropology. In 2003, he conducted the first excavation in the swamp, and in 2009, in partnership with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (which manages the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge) and American University, initiated the annual research program titled the Great Dismal Swamp Archaeology Field School. This effort continues the work of the landscape study. It examines the impact of colonialism, slavery, and development on the swamp, especially on the self-sustaining maroon settlements in the swamp's interior. It also studies native lifestyles before European contact. Prior to Sayers' efforts, no field research had been done on the Great Dismal Swamp maroons. Even today, the swamp is impenetrable in places; a research group gave up in 2003 because it lost its way so many times. Sites deep in the swamp's interior are still so remote that a guide is needed to find them. The National Endowment for the Humanities gave the \\"We The People Award\\" of $200,000 to the project in 2010. In fall 2011, a permanent exhibit was opened by the National Park Service to commemorate those who lived in the swamp during pre-Civil War times. Sayers summarizes: \\"These groups are very inspirational. As details unfold, we are increasingly able to show how people have the ability, as individuals and communities, to take control of their lives, even under oppressive conditions.\\" See also * African-Americans in North Carolina * Atlantic Creole * Bristol slave trade * Coastwise slave trade * Colonial South and the Chesapeake * First Africans in Virginia * Gullah * History of slavery in Virginia * Seasoning (colonialism) * Slavery in the colonial history of the United States * Tobacco colonies  References   Further reading  * \\"Running Servants and All Others\\": The Diverse and Elusive Maroons of the Great Dismal Swamp, 1619‚Äì1861.

Facts  The applicant brought eviction proceedings against the first respondents (the occupiers) in terms of the Prevention of Illegal Eviction from and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act (PIE)Act 19 of 1998.s 4 The occupiers made a counter-application for an order compelling the second respondent (the City) to provide a report within two months, stating what steps it would take to provide them with temporary emergency accommodation upon their eviction from the property, and what steps it would take to ensure access to adequate housing thereafter. It was argued that there would be no lawful and affordable alternative accommodation available to the occupiers in the event of their being evicted. The City duly filed a report detailing its programmes and plans in regard to accommodation and land in general. The report was not prepared specifically for the present case and so did not deal specifically with the occupiers of Saratoga Avenue. At the hearing of the matter, the occupiers objected in limine that the City had been improperly joined to the proceedings. The City consented to the joinder on the basis that it would argue the question of joinder as part of the application against it.  Judgment  In respect of the objection in limine, the court held that the question of whether or not it had been appropriate for the occupiers to join the City as a co-respondent could not be entertained, because a court order in which the City was joined had already been granted. That order stood until properly set aside by a court of competent jurisdiction. It did not therefore assist the City to submit that it consented to the joinder on the basis that it would argue the issue later. The objection in limine was dismissed.Para 4. The courts are obliged, under PIE, to \\"have regard to all relevant circumstances,\\" and would in most eviction proceedings be unable to comply with this obligation without comprehensive and specific input from the municipality.Para 52. The court held that in this case the City's report had failed to assist the court as it should have. The court required specific information in order to deal with the case before it; a generic answer was unacceptable.Paras 63-64. The court held further that a municipality is obliged in eviction cases to inform the court of whether or not land had been made available, or could reasonably be made available, for the relocation of the affected unlawful occupiers (as opposed to unlawful occupiers in general). The municipality had to investigate diligently the circumstances of the case and consult with stakeholders where necessary, since the court's hands would be tied without a full and meaningful report from the municipality.Paras 66, 75. Accordingly, the court ordered the City to report within four weeks on the steps it had taken and could in future take to provide emergency shelter or other housing for the occupiers in the event of eviction.

Marie ( ) is a city on the St. Marys River in Ontario, Canada, close to the Canada‚ÄìUS border. It is the seat of the Algoma District and the third largest city in Northern Ontario, after Sudbury and Thunder Bay. The Ojibwe, the indigenous Anishinaabe inhabitants of the area, call this area Baawitigong, meaning \\"place of the rapids.\\" They used this as a regional meeting place during whitefish season in the St. Mary's Rapids. (The anglicized form of this name, Bawating, is used in institutional and geographic names in the area.) To the south, across the river, is the United States and the Michigan city of the same name. These two communities were one city until a new treaty after the War of 1812 established the border between Canada and the United States in this area at the St. Mary's River. In the 21st century, the two cities are joined by the International Bridge, which connects Interstate 75 on the Michigan side, and Huron Street (and former Ontario Secondary Highway 550B) on the Ontario side. Shipping traffic in the Great Lakes system bypasses the Saint Mary's Rapids via the American Soo Locks, the world's busiest canal in terms of tonnage that passes through it, while smaller recreational and tour boats use the Canadian Sault Ste. Marie Canal. French colonists referred to the rapids on the river as Les Saults de Ste. Marie and the village name was derived from that. The rapids and cascades of the St. Mary's River descend more than from the level of Lake Superior to the level of the lower lakes. Hundreds of years ago, this slowed shipping traffic, requiring an overland portage of boats and cargo from one lake to the other. The entire name translates to \\"Saint Mary's Rapids\\" or \\"Saint Mary's Falls\\". The word sault is pronounced in French, and in the English pronunciation of the city name.\\"History\\" , Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan website Residents of the city are called Saultites. Sault Ste. Marie is bordered to the east by the Rankin and Garden River First Nation reserves, and to the west by Prince Township. To the north, the city is bordered by an unincorporated portion of Algoma District, which includes the local services boards of Aweres, Batchawana Bay, Goulais and District, Peace Tree and Searchmont. The city's census agglomeration, including the townships of Laird, Prince and Macdonald, Meredith and Aberdeen Additional and the First Nations reserves of Garden River and Rankin, had a total population of 79,800 in 2011. Native American settlements, mostly of Ojibwe-speaking peoples, existed here for more than 500 years. In the late 17th century, French Jesuit missionaries established a mission at the First Nations village. This was followed by development of a fur trading post and larger settlement, as traders, trappers and Native Americans were attracted to the community. It was considered one community and part of Canada until after the War of 1812 and settlement of the border between Canada and the US at the Ste. Mary's River. At that time, the US prohibited British traders from any longer operating in its territory, and the areas separated by the river began to develop as two communities, both named Sault Ste. Marie.\\"Sault Ste. Marie ‚Äì history\\", The North View, accessed 20 Dec 2008 History Ojibwe fishermen in the St. Marys Rapids, 1901 Sault Ste. Marie Museum in downtown Sault Ste. Marie After the visit of √âtienne Br√ªl√© in 1623, the French called it \\"Sault de Gaston\\" in honour of Gaston, Duke of Orl√©ans, the brother of King Louis XIII of France. In 1668, French Jesuit missionaries renamed it as Sault Sainte Marie, and established a mission settlement (present-day Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan) on the river's south bank. Later, a fur trading post was established and the settlement expanded to include both sides of the river. Sault Ste. Marie is one of the oldest French settlements in North America. It was at the crossroads of the fur trade route, which stretched from Montreal to Sault Ste. Marie and to the North country above Lake Superior. A cosmopolitan, mixed population of Europeans, First Nations peoples, and M√©tis lived at the village spanning the river. \\"Sault Ste. Marie ‚Äì history\\", The North View, accessed 20 Dec 2008 The city name originates from Saults de Sainte-Marie, archaic French for \\"Saint Mary's Falls\\", a reference to the rapids of Saint Marys River. Etymologically, the word sault comes from an archaic spelling of saut (from sauter), which translates most accurately in this usage to the English word cataract. This in turn derives from the French word for \\"leap\\" or \\"jump\\" (similar to somersault). Citations dating back to 1600 use the sault spelling to mean a cataract, waterfall or rapids. In modern French, however, the words chutes or rapides are more usual. Sault survives almost exclusively in geographic names dating from the 17th century. (See also Long Sault, Ontario, Sault St. Louis, Quebec, and Grand Falls/Grand-Sault, New Brunswick, three other place names where \\"sault\\" also carries this meaning.) Traders regularly interacted with tribes from around the Great Lakes, and Scots-British fur trader John Johnston, his Ojibwe wife and multi-racial were prominent among all societies here in the late eighteenth century. Their daughter, Jane Johnston Schoolcraft married Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, a US Indian agent and early ethnographer, and they had children. She has been recognized as the first Native American poet and writer in the United States. This fluid environment changed during and after the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States. Trade dropped during the war and on July 20, 1814 an American force destroyed the North West Company depot on the north shore of the St. Marys River. Since the Americans were unable to capture Fort Mackinac, the British forces retained control of Sault Ste. Marie.Mary Ellen Perkins (ed.)

Cairn commemorating the Wolseley Expedition to quell the Red River Rebellion. Turning the first sod ceremony for the construction of the Sault Ste. Marie Canal, 30 July 1890. In 1870, the United States refused to give the steamer Chicona, carrying Colonel Garnet Wolseley, permission to pass through the locks at Sault Ste Marie. In order to control their own water passage, the Canadians constructed the Sault Ste. Marie Canal, which was completed in 1895.Mary Ellen Perkins (ed.) 'Discover your heritage: A Guide to Provincial Plaques in Ontario' Natural Heritage (Jun 30 1989) ‚Äì plaque near Canadian locks, Huron Street, Saint Ste. Marie Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario was incorporated as a town in 1887 and a city in 1912. The town gained brief international notoriety in 1911 in the trial of Angelina Napolitano, the first person in Canada to use the battered woman defence for murder. During World War II, and particularly after the US was attacked at Pearl Harbor in 1941, government concern turned to protection of the locks and shipping channel at Sault Ste. Marie. A substantial military presence was established to protect the locks from a possible attack by Nazi German aircraft from the north. The recent development of long-range bombers increased fears of a sudden air raid. Military strategists studied polar projection maps, which indicated that the air distance from occupied Norway to the town was about the same as the distance from Norway to New York. That direct route of about is over terrain where there were few observers and long winter nights. A joint Canadian and US committee called the \\"Permanent Joint Board on Defence\\" drove the installation of anti-aircraft defence and associated units of the United States Army Air Forces and Royal Canadian Air Force to defend the locks. An anti-aircraft training facility was established north of Sault Ste. Marie on the shores of Lake Superior. Barrage balloons were installed, and early warning radar bases were established at five locations in northern Ontario (Kapuskasing, Cochrane, Hearst, Armstrong (Thunder Bay District), and Nakina) to watch for incoming aircraft. Military personnel were established to guard sensitive parts of the transportation infrastructure. A little over one year later, in January 1943, most of these facilities and defences were deemed excessive and removed, save a reduced military base at Sault Ste. Marie. The first Algerine-class minesweeper in the Royal Canadian Navy was named HMCS Sault Ste. Marie (J334) after the city. It was laid down in 1942 and acted as a convoy in the Battle of the Atlantic. On January 29, 1990, Sault Ste. Marie became a flashpoint in the Meech Lake Accord constitutional debate when council passed a resolution declaring English as the city's official languageCanadian Annual Review of Politics and Public Affairs, 1990, David Leyton-Brown (ed.), p.135. \\"On the language front, a major headache for the government began when the Sault Ste Marie City Council, under pressure from the Alliance for the Preservation of English in Canada, declared English as its official language.\\" and the sole language for provision of municipal services. French speakers had already gained the use of French as an official language for government services.Crosswords: Language, Education and Ethnicity in French Ontario, Monica Heller, p. 79 The city had a sizable French-speaking population and these residents objected strongly to the council's action. The Sault Ste. Marie language resolution was not the first of its kind in Ontario, but the municipality was the largest to have passed such a resolution and the first to do so despite its sizable Franco- Ontarian population.Heller, Crosswords, p. 80 Climate Sault Ste. Marie has a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Dfb) with cold, snowy winters and warm summers that are moderated to some extent by Lake Superior. Winters are cold but are milder than some inland places. Temperatures drop below 24 days per year. Summers are warm with a July high of and temperatures above occur 4 days per year. The average annual precipitation is , which is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year; February is the driest month, and the autumn months of September to November are the wettest months. The highest temperature ever recorded in Sault Ste. Marie was on 3 July 1921, while the record low was on 26 January 1927. Economy The city developed considerable industry before and after World War II, especially in steel-making. Algoma (formerly Algoma Steel; Essar Steel Algoma) is the largest single employer, with 3500 employees at the main plant and approximately 553 (440 unionized and 113 non-unionized) at an adjacent tube mill operated by Tenaris. During the 1940s, the steel and chromium operations were of substantial importance to the war effort in Canada and the United States. Algoma Steel and the Chromium Mining and Smelting Corporation were key producers for transportation and military machines. The Huron Central Railway has been important into the 21st century to the operation of the steel operation, despite extensive railway restructuring elsewhere. Genesee and Wyoming, Inc., owner of the railway, announced its intention to discontinue operations. It continued to operate under an agreement which terminated on August 15, 2010. ESSAR Steel Algoma Inc. St. Mary's Paper, now closed Sault Ste. Marie at night from the International Space Station in 2016 Sault Ste. Marie prospered during the 1960s and '70s, but as imported steel began to compete with domestic production, the local industry began to contract. Since the late 1980s, Algoma has declared bankruptcy twice and laid off large numbers of workers, adversely affecting the regional economy. Algoma was bailed out by the Ontario government with interest-free loans. The company had a swift turnaround in 2004 from its earlier financial troubles of the 1990s. China's increased demand for steel of the past decade has increased the price of steel. Denis Turcotte, CEO, was named \\"Canadian CEO of the year\\" in 2006 for his efforts. An offer to purchase ASI by the Essar Group (India) had been recommended by the ASI Board of Directors and was approved. The company was officially sold to the Essar Group in June 2007 for $1.6 billion. Forestry is also a major local industry. St. Mary's Paper has been closed and decommissioned, although it was reopened in June 2007 and operated for a time under new ownership. Also related to wood products is Flakeboard Ltd., which employs over 110 people in the community. An adjacent melamine factory manufactures products with Flakeboard's materials. Examples are furniture and cupboards where a finish is added to the product. Together both of Flakeboard's factories employ about 150 people. The Huron Central Railway is important to these local industries as well. The business process outsourcing industry had three call centres in the city, which together employed about 1500 people. The largest, Sutherland Global Services, closed in 2019 and Agero is closing in April 2020. Nucomm previously had a call centre here as well. The call centre industry became a major source of jobs and had contributed to the economic turnaround of the city in the late 1990s. Another large employer in the community is the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation (OLG). The OLG has a corporate office located on the waterfront. It employs a total of about 900 people in Sault Ste. Marie between the corporate office and OLG Casino Sault Ste. Marie. The prize centre used to be administered in the city but this operation was moved back to Toronto (York Mills) in 2009. The OLG is still the fourth-largest employer, after Algoma Steel, Sault Area Hospital, and the call centre industry. Sault Ste. Marie is one of only a few cities in Ontario where a municipal bylaw prevents stores from opening on December 26, a Commonwealth holiday known as Boxing Day, and the day after Christmas. Retail stores in Sault Ste. Marie begin their post-Christmas Boxing Day sales on December 27. A municipal referendum to determine whether voters favour allowing stores to open on Boxing Day was held concurrently with the 2010 municipal election.Wording of Sault Ste. Marie referendum question yet to be decided\\". Sudbury Star, February 18, 2010. Voter turnout was not high enough to make the referendum legally binding, but 60.77 per cent of voters opposed allowing stores to open on the holiday.\\"Boxing Day Vote ‚Äì The People Have Spoken\\". soonews.ca, October 26, 2010. Alternative energy The Sault Ste. Marie Solar Park (68 MW), co-generation plant (Brookfield Power), F. H. Clergue Hydroelectric Generating Station, nearby Prince Township Wind Farm (189 MW) and several nearby hydroelectric dams, form part of the city's push to develop alternative forms of energy and gain the title of 'Alternative Energy Capital of North America'. Two other wind farms are proposed for the area: the Goulais wind farm (25 MW) and the Bow Lake wind farm (58 MW), in partnership with the Batchewana First Nation of Ojibways to be built near Montreal River Harbour. Elementa Group has built a pilot waste-to-energy plant in Sault Ste. Marie, and the local Public Utilities Commission collects methane gas from the city's landfill. Transportation Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario (left), Soo Locks and International Bridge (centre), and Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan (right), with St. Marys River in the background Sault Ste. Marie Canal, with the International Bridge and rail bridge in background Sault Ste. Marie is served by Highway 17, designated as a segment of the Trans- Canada Highway in the region. The highway connects the city to Thunder Bay to the northwest and Sudbury to the east. The International Bridge connects downtown Sault Ste. Marie to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, becoming Interstate 75 on the American side. Interstate 75 continues south to Saginaw, Flint, and Detroit before crossing into Ohio, eventually terminating in Hialeah, Florida, near Miami. The International Bridge also directs traffic from the American side of the border via Sault Ste. Marie's new transport route that runs from the bridge to Second Line. This new limited-access roadway, known as \\"Carmen's Way\\" after the late MP Carmen Provenzano, will make it much easier for transport trucks to reach main roads. The route of Carmen's Way has a wide grassy right-of-way on both sides of the roadway, to facilitate future expansion of its lane capacity. Planning is underway to eventually connect Second Line East to the new four-lane section of Highway 17 that recently opened east of the city. The city plays an inherited role in marine transportation, with the locks in Michigan being an integral component of the St. Lawrence Seaway. The city operates its own small-scale lock which is used by small boats and other pleasure craft in the summer. Also recently opened is a multi-modal terminal designed to take advantage of the Sault as a rail, road, and water transportation hub. Sault Ste. Marie is also served by Sault Ste. Marie Airport and Sault Transit Services. The city is no longer connected by passenger rail to any other major cities, but is part of the Algoma Central Railway network, which runs north from the city to the small town of Hearst. In 2006 the city's Member of Parliament, Tony Martin, called for passenger rail service to be reinstated between Sault Ste. Marie and Sudbury. In 2018, Ontario Northland announced a major service expansion west of Sudbury, which includes multiple stops in Sault Ste. Marie. Passengers may board buses headed toward Hearst, Sudbury, or Manitoulin Island. ONTC currently has three stops in the city, with the main stop being along Trunk Road on the east end, and the other stops being at Sault College and the hospital. Tourism Area tourist attractions include the Canadian Bushplane Heritage Centre, the Sault Ste. Marie Museum, the Sault Ste. Marie Canal National Historic Site, boat tours of the Sault locks (which connect Lake Superior with the lower Great Lakes), Whitefish Island, the Ermatinger-Clergue National Historic Site, Casino Sault Ste. Marie, the Art Gallery of Algoma and the Algoma Central Railway's popular Agawa Canyon Tour Train. The MS Norgoma, a Canadian passenger ship, was a museum ship in the Great Lakes at Sault Ste. Marie. This ship is no longer docked in Sault Ste. Marie. Nearby parks include Pancake Bay Provincial Park, Batchawana Bay Provincial Park and Lake Superior Provincial Park. Winter activities are also an asset to Sault Ste Marie's tourism industry with the annual Bon Soo Winter Carnival, Searchmont Resort as a great ski and snowboard destination, Stokely Creek Lodge (cross country ski resort) and Hiawatha a nearby cross country ski trails. The city also hosts a large snowmobile trail system that criss-crosses the province of Ontario. A new non- motorized HUB trail is being created around the city () so that walkers, rollerbladers and cyclists (snowshoeing and cross country skiing in winter) can enjoy the beautiful and convenient circle tour around town. The Voyageur Hiking Trail, a long-distance trail that will eventually span from Sudbury to Thunder Bay, originated in Sault Ste. Marie in 1973. The Roberta Bondar Pavilion was created to commemorate the first Canadian female astronaut to go into space. The city is also home to the Station Mall, one of the largest shopping malls in Northern Ontario. Demographics Similar to many other Northern Ontario municipalities, Sault Ste. Marie's population has declined in the 1990s and early 2000s, with many individuals migrating to larger cities in southern Ontario. Since the early 1990s, the city had dropped from 84,000 to 74,566 residents, but in the 2006 census the city's population grew very slightly to 74,948. The city's census agglomeration, consisting of the townships of Laird, Prince and Macdonald, Meredith and Aberdeen Additional and the First Nations reserves of Garden River and Rankin, had a total population of 80,098, up from 78,908 in 2001. Sault Ste. Marie was at one time a haven for Italian immigrants. The city has a large concentration of ethnic Italians for a community its size, mostly descending from the southern region of Calabria. The city also has a significant First Nations population, with three reserves nearby. Those who are of European origin constitute 86.2% of the population, Aboriginals or Native Canadians, constitute 11.1%, and visible minorities make up 2.7%. Sault Ste Marie's Italian population constitutes 21.8% of the population. This is only surpassed by English (28%), French (23.8%), and Irish (21.9%). Christianity is the chief faith in the city, with Roman Catholicism being the largest denomination. This can be attributed to the large number of citizens with a traditional French and Italian Catholic heritage. After Catholicism and Protestantism, those who identify as being non-religious make up almost one-quarter of residents.

The most recent municipal election was held on October 22, 2018, and the mayoralty was won by incumbent Christian Provenzano, who garnered 70.15% of the vote. \\"Official 2018 Municipal Election Results\\". Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario Provenzano's predecessor, Debbie Amaroso, was the first woman elected to this office.Debbie Amaroso is our first female mayor! . Sootoday.com, October 26, 2010. The city's crest contains the words \\"Ojibwa Kitche Gumeeng Odena\\" (from Ojibwe gichi-gamiing oodena) which means \\"Town by the large body of water of the Ojibwe\\" (or simply \\"Town by Lake Superior\\") in the Ojibwe language. The city is served by the Sault Ste. Marie federal electoral district and the Sault Ste. Marie provincial electoral district. The boundaries of these two districts are not identical; the provincial district encompasses the city alone, while the federal district includes the neighbouring Garden River and Rankin reserves, and extends northerly to the Montreal River. The city's current federal Member of Parliament is Terry Sheehan (Liberal), and its seat in the provincial legislature is Ross Romano (Conservative). See also Neighbourhoods in Sault Ste.

Its gain of performance is reached by zero-copy mechanisms for network packets (RX_RING, TX_RING), so that the Linux kernel does not need to copy packets from kernel space to user space via system calls such as \`recvmsg()\`. libpcap, starting with release 1.0.0, also supports the zero-copy mechanism on Linux for capturing (RX_RING), so programs using libpcap also use that mechanism on Linux. Overview netsniff-ng was initially created as a network sniffer with support of the Linux kernel packet-mmap interface for network packets, but later on, more tools have been added to make it a useful toolkit such as the iproute2 suite, for instance. Through the kernel's zero-copy interface, efficient packet processing can be reached even on commodity hardware. For instance, Gigabit Ethernet wire-speed has been reached with netsniff-ng's trafgen. The netsniff-ng toolkit does not depend on the libpcap library. Moreover, no special operating system patches are needed to run the toolkit. netsniff-ng is free software and has been released under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.

The elder son of Sir William Galloway (1840‚Äì1927), Mining Professor at University College of Wales in Cardiff, and Christiana Maud Mary Gordon (1853‚Äì1880).The Compact Edition of the Dictionary of National Biography, Vol II. Sir William Galloway 1840-1927 His younger brother was Christian Francis John Galloway (1880‚Äì1969). Galloway was a renowned ethnographic artist and photographer who travelled extensively in Europe, whilst living firstly in Zeeland and later in Romania, recording the customs and costumes of the local people, from about 1914 until he returned to England in 1950.  Early years  Galloway was born in Cardiff, where his father was a mining engineer. He was educated at home with his brother and later attained his BSc in Mining Engineering at the University of Wales. Galloway joined the Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers, being appointed a 2nd Lieutenant on 10 March 1897, a Lieutenant on 7 December 1898, a Captain on 6 June 1903. He then resigned his commission on 30 April 1907. In 1901 his occupation was Artist Lieutenant in the Royal Monmouthshire Royal Engineers. In 1904, at the age of 26, Galloway joined the Slade School of Fine Arts in London.  Life in Europe  In 1914 Galloway settled in Westkapelle, Netherlands. While living there, he joined Jan Toorop's artist group in Domburg. He spent the next ten years painting, etching, sketching and photographing the village, the dike, the people and their traditional way of life. Following the destruction of the area in the bombing of October 1944, Galloway's work became an invaluable record of life in the pre-war era, and, as such, has been kept by the Polderhuis (Dyke and Polder War Museum of Westkapelle). Examples of Galloway's work are also held in the Royal Archives of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands. The Wooden church in Stana, as photographed by Denis Galloway in 1926. Kept in a collection by the Ethnographic Museum of Transylvania. Between 1926 and 1950, Galloway lived mainly in the town of Cluj, Romania. He worked for the Ethnographic Museum of Transylvania in Cluj between 1927 and 1929, spending periods of 5 to 6 months in different ethnographic areas of Transylvania. He painted watercolours of traditional rural holidays, paying particular attention to the finer details of traditional folk costumes. He collected ethnic objects and took photographs in the Kalotaszeg region, in Piladureni, Ha»õeg and in the Banat region. which were donated to the museum in 1927. Between 1930 and 1938, Galloway's connections with the Museum loosened, but there are a large number of his negatives from that time taken in the Nasaud county, and in the Tara Barsei, Osa and Bucovina regions which, in 1950 at the age of 72, Galloway donated to the Ethnographic Museum for their archives. They now hold about 450 negatives of his taken in the Netherlands, Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic, 647 negatives of pictures taken in Romania, and 27 autochrome glass plaques. Exhibitions of his artwork and photography are still being displayed, for example in Erdelyt Museum in July 2008http://www.szabadsag.ro/szabadsag/servlet/szabadsag/template/archive,PArchiveArticleSelectedScreen.vm/id/12098/mainarticle/false;jsessionid=F22BB6830A6E3D9B5E75D1224CAEE463 and at Polderhuis, Westkapelle from 2008 to mid 2009.http://www.polderhuiswestkapelle.nl/exposities/eerdere-exposities/zeeuws- expositie-denis-galloway/  Camera and pictures  Galloway used a Goertz camera on 8x11cm, 9x12cm and later 13x18cm glass plaques. Galloway's pictures are generally characterised by a harmony of composition and aesthetics. He aimed to produce a faithful documentation of the finest details, as can be seen in his paintings displayed at Westkapelle. Galloway's photographs fall mainly into three categories: # Pictures taken under the direction of ethnographical professor Romulus Vuia. These had a clear \\"ethnographic importance\\", registering information related to dwellings, households, specific activities, clothes and customs. These were also taken in both geographically and ethnically diverse communities (Romanian, Hungarian, Saxon and Slavic), with distinctive historical statuses. His pictures kept a colourful and detailed image of traditional Transylvanian rural life in the years 1920-1930.http://www.szabadsag.ro/szabadsag/servlet/szabadsag/template/archive,PArchiveArticleSelectedScreen.vm/id/12098/mainarticle/false;jsessionid=F22BB6830A6E3D9B5E75D1224CAEE463http://www.hagyomanyokhaza.hu/oldal/10398/ # Pictures based on his own ideas, the common element in this group is aesthesis.

He donated his Dutch art to the Museum at Westkapelle, and his Transylvanian negatives to the Ethnographic Museum of Transylvania. In 1953, Galloway joined the Folk-Lore Society and in his will he bequeathed his remaining collection of ethnographic photographs to the Folk-Lore Society at University College, London.

In a brief career of five races, he won the Irish 2000 Guineas at the Curragh and the Derby at Epsom in 1958. He was retired from racing later in the same year and stood as a stallion in Ireland and Japan. Background Hard Ridden was a ‚Äúlong and lean‚Äù bay horse bred in Ireland by Sir Oliver Lambart. His sire, Hard Sauce (1948- 1969) was a top-class racehorse, who excelled over sprint distances, winning the July Cup in 1951. Hard Ridden‚Äôs dam, Toute Belle, was a French- bred mare from a staying family who failed as a racehorse and was covered by Hard Sauce after failing to attract a buyer when put up for auction at Newmarket in December 1953. Hard Ridden was sent to the sales at Dublin as a yearling, and was bought for 270gns by Sir Victor Sassoon. The colt was sent into training with Mick Rogers at the Curragh. Racing career =1957: two- year-old season= Hard Ridden finished second in his only race as a two-year- old in 1957. =1958: three-year-old season= On his three-year-old debut, Hard Ridden ran second in a race at the Curragh. He was then returned to the same course for the Irish 2000 Guineas and won impressively by four lengths from the future Irish Derby winner, Sindon, with Paddy's Point third. The favourite for the Derby, Alcide, was withdrawn from the race after being ‚Äúgot at‚Äù (deliberately injured) in his stable, leaving the race looking very open. Hard Ridden, however, as the son of a sprinter, was thought unlikely to be effective over one and a half miles and started at 18/1 in a field of twenty in front of a crowd estimated at 200,000 including the Queen. Ridden by the fifty-one-year-old Charlie Smirke, Hard Ridden was held up in the early stages as the leaders set a moderate pace. In the straight, Smirke sent Hard Ridden through a gap on the inside to take the lead and go clear. In the closing stages Hard Ridden extended his advantage to win by five lengths from Paddy's Point and Nagami, becoming the first Irish-trained winner of the race since Orby in 1907. Immediately after the race Smirke announced \\"That's it,I've ridden my last Derby!.\\" Hard Ridden did not appear again on the racecourse until late July, when he ran in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot. He finished unplaced behind Ballymoss and was shortly afterwards retired to stud. Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated \\"Hard Ridden\\" as an ‚Äúinferior‚Äù Derby winner. Timeform rated Hard Ridden on a mark of 131. A rating of 130 is considered the mark of an above average European Group One winner. Stud career Hard Ridden stood as a stallion in Ireland until 1967 when he was exported to Japan.

Facts  The first respondent was the holder of a general covering notarial bond, passed in its favour by W CC over the assets of the latter. When W CC was placed in final liquidation, the first respondent applied to the High Court for an order declaring that the liquidation and distribution account in respect of W CC had to be redrawn so as to reflect its preference by virtue of that bond. The argument was raised that the bond did not comply with the requirements of the Security by Means of Movable Property Act,Act 57 of 1993.s 1(1). because it failed to specify and describe the assets referred to in the bond in a manner which rendered the assets readily recognisable.  Issue  The central issue in the instant appeal was whether or not a bond registered under the Act.s 1(1). complied with the requirements so that the \\"mortgagee\\" acquired security in the movable property referred to in the bond and therefore ranked as a secured creditor in the event of the liquidation of the debtor.  Judgment  It was clear to the court that, without reference to invoices and other documents in respect of the items listed, or without the intervention of some person who was able to say that the particular items listed were subject to the bond, the items could not be identified as those listed in the bond.Para 7. The court held that the bond had to specify and describe the property so as to render it readily recognisable. Nothing could be added to an instrument that had the effect of creating a real right that availed against third parties. The third party had to be able to identify the items by reference to the document alone, by correlating the descriptions contained therein with property fitting such descriptions.Paras 11, 13.

It was not possible for third parties, even the liquidators, to take the bond and to correlate the descriptions with the assets on the premises. In the circumstances, the bond had failed to create a deemed pledge over the property of W CC, with the result that the appellant was not a secured creditor.Para 25.

It is a registered charity (no. 227464). It issues a journal, Archives, and other publications; hosts conferences and seminars; and undertakes other activities to promote the care and preservation of archives and the interests of archive users at a national level. Membership is open to all, and the association (in contrast to exclusively scholarly bodies, and exclusively professional bodies) therefore plays a particular role as a forum which brings together owners of archives, academic and amateur documentary researchers, archivists and librarians, and institutions and societies concerned with archives. History The association was formally founded in 1932, but it took over the Records Preservation Section established three years earlier in 1929 by the British Record Society (see below). The similarity of name between the two bodies was a deliberate choice, made in order to emphasise continuity.Harris 1989, p. 8. The formation of the new association ‚Äì and its not entirely amicable split from the BRS ‚Äì was largely the initiative of (Sir) Hilary Jenkinson.Harris 1989, pp. 7‚Äì9.Roger Ellis, \\"Records Preservation from BRS to BRA: the shaping of the British Records Association and of its Records Preservation Section, 1928‚Äì1979\\", in Jubilee Essays 1992, pp. 16‚Äì30. He remained the BRA's guiding force for nearly 30 years. From 1930 to 1932 he had served as Secretary of the Drafting Committee which established the association; and he subsequently served as its Joint Honorary Secretary 1932‚Äì47; Chairman of the Records Preservation Section 1947‚Äì61; Vice-President of the association 1954‚Äì61; and as a member of most of its committees.Bond 1962, pp. 86‚Äì8. Other active members in the early years included G. H. Fowler, Joan Wake, Irene Churchill, Kathleen Major, William Le Hardy, and H. M. Cashmore. Prior to the establishment of the Society of Local Archivists in 1947, the BRA was the closest that Britain had to a professional association for archivists, and it played a central role in laying down professional standards and principles, and in promoting the establishment of professionally staffed local archive services in the post-War years.Bond 1962.Felix Hull, \\"The BRA and the new post-War local Record Offices: I\\", in Jubilee Essays 1992, pp. 37‚Äì41.Baker 2018, pp. 39‚àí40. During the Second World War, when the British government promoted a salvage campaign to encourage the recycling of waste paper, the BRA ran a vigorous counter-campaign to safeguard against the over-enthusiastic destruction of records of historical value.Bond 1962, pp. 75‚Äì7.Harris 1989, p. 10.Baker 2018, p. 38. In 1943, it produced a report on British Records after the War, which proposed legislation to control local and private archives.Reprinted as Although most of its proposals proved to be too draconian for general acceptance, they did lead to the establishment of the National Register of Archives in 1945.Bond 1962, pp. 85‚Äì6.Robert Somerville, \\"Wartime\\", in Jubilee Essays 1992, pp. 31‚Äì36.Baker 2018, pp. 40‚Äì41. From 1974 to 1992, the BRA's administrative secretary was the former Soviet spy John Vassall, who, following his release from prison, had begun a new life under the name John Phillips. Presidency By tradition, the president of the association is the Master of the Rolls of the day. At the time of the BRA's foundation, and until 1958, the Master of the Rolls was also Keeper of Public Records, and nominal head of the Public Record Office. Under the Public Records Act 1958, responsibility for public records was transferred from the Master of the Rolls to the Lord Chancellor; but the BRA chose not to follow this lead. The current president is therefore Sir Terence Etherton. Publications =Journal= The association has published a journal, Archives, twice-yearly since 1949. It is peer-reviewed, and contains a range of articles relating to the history, preservation, accessibility and use of archives, historical case-studies drawing heavily on archival research, and discussions of archival trends, theories and practices. It also carries reports and reviews of recent archival publications, web sites, exhibits and events. From spring 2019, the journal will be published on behalf of the Association by Liverpool University Press. The journal's editors have been: Roger Ellis, 1949‚Äì57; Joan Lancaster, 1957‚Äì63; Arthur Owen, 1964‚Äì76; Andrew Cook, 1977‚Äì84; John Warner-Davies/Davies, 1985‚Äì89; Jeremy Black, 1990‚Äì2005; Ruth Paley, 2006‚Äìdate. =Archives and the User= Since 1970, the association has published a series of handbooks providing introductory guides to historical documentary sources for researchers and editors, under the series title \\"Archives and the User\\". Titles published to date are:    * * =Other publications= The association publishes a twice-yearly newsletter (from 2011, in electronic form). It has from time to time issued other occasional publications, including memoranda on good practice; and conference proceedings. Conferences and meetings The BRA holds an annual one-day conference, focusing on a particular thematic area of historical records. Until 2017, the conference was normally held in late November or early December; but the decision was then taken to schedule the next conference for Spring 2019 (no conference being held in 2018). The annual Maurice Bond Memorial Lecture, named after the former Clerk of the House of Lords Record Office, is held in the late autumn (normally October) in conjunction with the association's AGM, and is delivered by a speaker prominent in the world of scholarship, record-keeping or politics. Recent Maurice Bond Lecturers have included Clyde Jeavons, formerly of the National Film and Television Archive (2005), Nicholas Rodger (2006), Nicholas Kingsley of The National Archives (2007), Bamber Gascoigne (2008), Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet (2009), Frank Prochaska (2010), Michael Meadowcroft, MP (2011), Peter Hennessy (2012), Professor Eric Ketelaar (2013), Jeremy Musson (2014), Fiona Skillen (2015), Caroline Shenton (2016), and Joan Winterkorn (2017). The association also holds other occasional conferences, seminars and training sessions. Harley Prize In 2018, the association established the annual Harley Prize in memory of Janette Harley (1951‚Äì2015). The prize, of ¬£350, is awarded for the best or most original piece of work published in any media in the previous three years which has met the aims of the association in promoting the preservation, understanding, accessibility or study of archives. Records Preservation Section BRA stamp on a historic document, showing that it has passed through the hands of the Records Preservation Section. The number indicates its earlier provenance. The Records Preservation Section (RPS; originally Records Preservation Committee, or Records Preservation Branch) was established under the auspices of the British Record Society in 1929, in the aftermath of the Law of Property Act 1922 and the Land Registration Act 1925, both of which rendered certain classes of historical property record redundant for legal purposes, and so at risk of destruction. It was partly inspired by (though not directly modelled on) the example of the National Art Collections Fund. Its responsibilities and assets were formally transferred to the newly formed British Records Association in March 1933.Harris 1989, pp. 3‚Äì9.Ellis, \\"Records Preservation from BRS to BRA\\", in Jubilee Essays 1992, pp. 16‚Äì30. The role of the RPS is to act as a rescue organisation and clearing-house for records deemed to be at risk, passing them on to appropriate institutional custodians. In practice, most of the records it has received have always come from the offices of London solicitors, and have been transferred to county record offices and other local archive repositories around the United Kingdom. The work of the RPS was carried out largely by volunteers from its foundation until 1948, when a paid executive officer was appointed. From 1950 to 2009 the association was able to employ a qualified archivist (and at times other staff), principally to undertake Records Preservation work. This was made possible in part through the receipt of an annual grant-in-aid from HM Treasury, paid from 1959 to 2000; but the work is now again carried out on an entirely voluntary basis.Baker 2018, pp. 41‚Äì43.

Facts  Ms Singh brought motion proceedings in a Local Division, claiming an order for the return of her vehicle, which was then in the possession of Santam. The insurance company had issued a motor dealers' external risks policy to a firm owned by one \\"M.\\" Singh's car was damaged in an accident in circumstances such that Santam was obliged to indemnify \\"M\\" under the policy. \\"M\\" submitted a claim form in respect of the damage, and Santam instructed a panelbeater to effect repairs and paid for them. When Santam later became aware that M had failed to pay any premiums, it cancelled the policy and, on 5 July, 1990 took the car while it was still in possession of the panelbeater. Singh alleged that she was the owner of the car, and that Santam's possession was unlawful. The case hinged on Santam's claim that it had been impoverished and the appellant enriched to the extent of the payment to the panelbeater, and that it was accordingly entitled to retain possession under a lien operative against Singh. The Local Division found for the appellant, whereafter a Full Bench of a Provincial Division found for Santam.  Judgment  On appeal to the Appellate Division, the court pointed out that any lien the panelbeater might have had ended when Santam paid for the repairs. The court then held that the problem with the suggestion that Santam had acquired its own lien was that the expenditure in question had to occur while the party claiming the lien was in possession of the subject-matter; Santam, however, incurred no expenditure, and made no improvement to the car, after it took possession.295I-J. The suggestion that the panelbeater possessed the vehicle as an agent for Santam, and that Santam accordingly did acquire possession before 5 July, was not borne out by Santam's own affidavit, which stated that \\"M\\" had placed the panelbeater in possession of the car, that it was returned to him, and that Santam only later took possession. The mere fact that Santam had authorised the panelbeater to effect the repairs took the matter no further, because the panelbeater could at least as readily have done so while holding the car for \\"M\\" as for Santam. Given that it was \\"M\\" who delivered the car, it was necessary for Santam to prove that there had been some form of attornment, a tripartite agreement between Santam, the panelbeater and \\"M\\" to the effect that, although the panelbeater had formerly held for \\"M,\\" it would thereafter hold for Santam. There was, however, no attempt to prove such an attornment; accordingly, the attempt to establish possession prior to 5 July had to fail. The court held further, with respect to the requirement that the possession upon which reliance was placed had to have been lawfully acquired, that this caused a further problem for the insurance company: It was difficult to understand what right Santam had to take possession of the car, or for that matter what right the panelbeater had to surrender it to Santam. An enrichment lien, the court noted, could not exist in vacuo; it served merely to strengthen an underlying cause of action based on unjust enrichment. Even assuming that the impoverishment of Santam and the enrichment of Singh were established, it had not been sine causa. The facts in the instant case were akin to the second type of claim mentioned in Buzzard Electrical v Jan Smuts Avenue Investments,1996 (4) SA 19 (A).25I-J where the owner had contracted with \\"B\\" for improvements to his property, but where \\"B,\\" instead of doing the work himself, had subcontracted it to \\"A,\\" who sued the owner once the work was finished. In such a case, it was held, the owner's enrichment was not sine causa; it had its origin in the agreement with \\"B.\\" The court found accordingly that, if Singh had been a party to the arrangements between \\"M\\" and Santam, her enrichment flowed from \\"M's\\" insurance policy, not from Santam's payment; if anyone was entitled to be enriched gratuitously, it was she. Furthermore, even if the facts were not akin to type two in Buzzard, the question remained as to whether or not Singh's enrichment was unjust. It appeared that Santam had cancelled the policy by conscious choice only a fortnight after the payment to the panelbeater, so that payment was made pursuant to the policy.298A-C. The court held that, even if the policy had perished automatically because of non-payment of the premiums, Santam's evidence indicated that it made payment in the belief that it was still alive. There was no evidence of error; even if there had been, it would have been unfair to visit the consequences on Singh, the party entitled to have her car repaired for nothing. Accordingly, the court added, it could well be that Santam's claim to a lien should founder also for lack of an underlying enrichment action. The upshot was that Santam had not proved an enrichment lien, and that Singh, as owner, was entitled to the return of her car.298E.

A deep continuous contour trench in Maharashtra, India A contour trenchline in India Between two trenches crops can benefit during the growing season (when there is less rain) from the subsoil water reserve gathered during the rainy season. Advantages Immediate advantages are the following: *The rain water does not immediately run off the hill, *Water does not evaporate uselessly *The water balance is enhanced *Crops do not suffer later on from water shortage, *Fertile soil particles are not lost by water and wind erosion. *When the sun shines on the water, light and heat are reflected onto plants on the northern shore of the trench, this effect and the increased humidity create micro climates in the area. These micro climates can support plants from different hardiness zones. Techniques Trenches can be artificially dug along the contour lines. Water flowing down the hill is retained by the trench, and is infiltrating the soil below. Implementation Depending on the slope of the hill, the parallel trenches can be closer or further from one another. Manually dug trenches are smaller. Machine dug trenches can be deeper. The dimensions, and the format of the trench should correspond to the local climate and soil conditions. The trench should be big enough to keep all the water; no water should spoil over the downhill border. The upside of the trench should be protected against erosion, by means of e.g. grass, shrubs, or fabric.

Only one was built; it was used in radar station trials in the Summer of 1940. Design and development The all wood Viking 2 was a close relative of the earlier Viking 1 but bigger, heavier and with a modified and repositioned wing. The latter retained the same planform, having a constant chord central section and tapered outer panels with rounded tips. The outer panels, each about one third of the span, carried full width, variable droop ailerons. A pair of spoilers was fitted at mid-chord on the centre section. However, the wing was mid- mounted rather than shoulder mounted and had slight dihedral on the thickened central section. The upper surfaces of the outer panels were without dihedral, forming overall a cantilever gull wing. The wing span was 10 ft 0 in (3.06 m) greater than that of the Viking 1. The fuselage of the Viking 2 was also similar to those of its predecessor, oval in section and plywood skinned, though wider to accommodate the side-by-side cockpit and also 27 in (686 mm) longer. The canopy line was lower and smoother than that of the Viking 1. The fuselage narrowed to the rear where the tapered tailplane was mounted just above the fuselage on a short sub-fin or pedestal. The chord of both pedestal and tailplane were greater than on the Viking 1, with more sweep on the tailplane's leading edge. There was no fixed fin; the tapered, rounded, fabric covered rudder extended to the lower fuselage and moved in a cut-out in the elevators. A single main skid reached from the nose to below cockpit, where there was a single, part exposed fixed wheel. There was a bumper on the extreme rear fuselage. Operational history The prototype Viking 2 first flew on 27 August 1939, from Dunstable. This was only a few days before the UK declared war, when civilian glider flying was banned. Nonetheless, the Viking received its Certificate of Airworthiness in January 1940. In June 1940 it was impressed into service with the RAF Christchurch based Special Flight Unit for trials of the radar stations along the English south coast. It was later test flown from Farnborough but was lost after wing flutter developed; both pilots escaped safely by parachute.

In Europe, it was also released as a single in 1981, backed by another song from The River, \\"Ramrod\\". Although it was not released as a single in the US, it did reach #20 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. Lyrics and music \\"Point Blank\\" was written in 1978, and was the first song Springsteen wrote after completing the Darkness on the Edge of Town album. \\"Point Blank\\" had its live premiere on July 7, 1978 in a concert on the Darkness Tour at the Roxy Theatre in West Hollywood, California, at which \\"Independence Day\\" was also premiered. In its 1978 incarnation, the lyrics dealt with the singer's girlfriend's drug addiction. A live 1978 performance from Houston, Texas is included on a DVD in The Promise box set. In 2015, Springsteen stated that he regards \\"Point Blank,\\" \\"Stolen Car,\\" \\"Independence Day\\" and the title track as being \\"the heart and soul\\" of The River album. \\"Point Blank\\", along with the title track, \\"Wreck on the Highway\\" and \\"Independence Day\\", is one of the verse-chorus songs on The River that was essentially a short story or character sketch. As with \\"The River\\" and \\"Independence Day\\", this song deals with the disappointments of working-class family life. With The River, Springsteen figured out how to create an album on which happy songs like \\"Sherry Darling\\" could co-exist with painful songs like \\"Point Blank\\". And \\"Point Blank\\" is one of the most painful songs on the album. The emotions covered by the song include disappointment, fear, loneliness and desperation. \\"Point Blank\\" is also one of several songs on the album dealing with the conflict between dreams and reality. The singer dreams that he is still with his former girlfriend and they are dancing together. But waking up, he realizes he saw the girlfriend standing in the doorway trying to stay out of the rain, looking \\"like just another stranger waitin' to get blown away.\\" The ex-girlfriend is the subject of the song's narrative. She grew up fast, but rather than getting the life she wanted, she ended up on welfare. The singer sings that: :I was gonna be your Romeo you were gonna be my Juliet :These days you don't wait on Romeo's :You wait on that welfare check This was the third reference to a Romeo in a Springsteen-penned song, earlier ones being \\"Incident on 57th Street\\" from the 1973 album The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle and \\"Fire\\", which was covered by Robert Gordon in 1978. The music is highlighted by Roy Bittan's sensitive piano playing and Springsteen's singing, alternating between vulnerability, disbelief and anger. Themes Author Rob Kirkpatrick describes the theme of the \\"Point Blank\\" as \\"you're born dying.\\" Jeffrey Symynkywicz described the theme as being that \\"there is an inexorable decline that is carved at the heart of life.\\" Springsteen has stated that one of the themes of the song is the fact that if you ease up as you get older, you effectively cease to exist. When introducing the song at a 1981 concert, Springsteen stated: > A song ain't no good until somebody hears it. By yourself you can't have an > effect. You have to reach out. This is a song about someone who loses that > power, which is the most powerful thing in the world - your ability to > affect your friends' lives ... and my life ... and maybe I can do somethin' > for you. So ... this is called \\"Point Blank.\\" There are at least two theories as to the origin of the title. One theory is that it comes from the 1967 Lee Marvin movie Point Blank. Another is that it came from a comment made by an ex-girlfriend during the heat of an argument. Critical reception Rolling Stone Magazine critic Dave Marsh described the song as \\"portentous.\\" Author June Skinner Sawyers described the song as \\"a song of shadows, of lives going nowhere, of broken relationships, and broken promises.\\" References External links * Lyrics & Audio clips from Brucespringsteen.net Category:1980 songs Category:1981 singles Category:Bruce Springsteen songs Category:Songs written by Bruce Springsteen Category:Song recordings produced by Jon Landau Category:Columbia Records singles Category:Song recordings produced by Bruce Springsteen Category:Song recordings produced by Steven Van Zandt ","title":"Point Blank (Bruce Springsteen song)"},{"id":"33658016","text":"Kakh (, also Romanized as KƒÅkh) is a village in Khenaman Rural District, in the Central District of Rafsanjan County, Kerman Province, Iran.

It was founded by the brothers, Parvez Damania (who also later played a vital role in Sahara India Pariwar in their venture Air Sahara and then went on to become the executive director Kingfisher Airlines and Vispi Damania, who later became vice president finance of Kingfisher Airlines. History Damania Airways was founded in 1992 and began flying on 10 March 1993 with two Boeing 737 aircraft leased from TAP Air of Portugal. With its base in Bombay (Now Mumbai), the airline had regular flights to Delhi, Calcutta, Madras, Bangalore, Goa and Indore. An additional two aircraft were leased later. This was an extremely competitive period for domestic Indian aviation as the domestic aviation sector had been reopened to private participation after many decades, and the government-owned Indian Airlines monopoly status ceased. The government designated the new airlines as 'air taxis'. Some of the prominent airlines of that time were Jet Airways, East West, ModiLuft, Continental. Parvez Damania's intention to bring an 'international' standard of flying to domestic Indian aviation made the airline a big draw among domestic flyers. The airline was extremely successful and its superior in-flight service soon became the standard for domestic Indian aviation. By the end of 1993, the airline carried over 200,000 passengers even though they accounted for just 2 per cent of traffic. In 1994, the Indian Government granted scheduled domestic airline status to nine private air-taxi operators including Damania Airways. Damania Airways was the first airline to make use of permission granted by the Aviation Ministry and offer alcohol in-flight. In 1995, under pressure from Indian Airlines to ensure a level playing field, the Aviation Ministry mandated that the private airlines must fly a certain number of flights on'secondary' routes to 'qualify' to fly to the major, profitable routes. The Aviation Ministry also delayed approvals to the private airlines to obtain smaller aircraft for the secondary routes. This completely altered the financials of flying and many airlines succumbed to the impossible stipulations. Damania Airways's superior draw helped the airline stay aloft for longer than most other airlines, but the delay in permissions to bring in smaller aircraft and the restrictions of destinations became a two-pronged pressure. The Chennai-based Khemka-owned NEPC group, promoters of the Skyline NEPC airline, acquired management control of the airline in May 1995. Skyline NEPC's fleet was composed entirely of Fokker turboprop aircraft, and their network covered only small towns. This would have allowed the airline to claim credit for the flights flown between the secondary towns while reserving the 737 jets for the major cities. With a view to capitalising on the Damania Airways brand draw, Skyline NEPC flew the Damania Airways aircraft with the original Damania Airways livery. Within a few months the entire airline was renamed Skyline NEPC. NEPC Airlines and its subsidiary, Skyline NEPC, were grounded 2 years later in 1997. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) suspended them for non-payment of dues, following which they were taken off the computerised reservation system (CRS).

He was educated at Royal College, Colombo. He then went on to study medicine at Ceylon Medical College and King's College London from where he graduated in 1925 with MB degree and a Conjoint Diploma. Soon afterwards he gained the MRCP and FRCS qualification. Paul married his cousin Winifred Hanah Ponmani, daughter of Dr William H. Ponniah Kanagasabai, in 1926. They had one son ‚Äì Wakeley. Ponmani was a sick woman and died in 1944 of cardiac failure caused by rheumatic mitral stenosis. After Ponmani's death Paul married Irma Maheswari Tampoe Phillips, daughter of Francis Philips. They had three sons (Sivanta, Amarjit and Avinder) and one daughter (Shikhandini). Career Paul returned to Ceylon in 1926 after obtaining his medical qualifications in the UK. He applied for the post of Fifth Surgeon at Colombo General Hospital but was rejected due to his \\"youth and inexperience\\". He was instead appointed acting professor of anatomy. The Fifth Surgeon post remained vacant and two years later Paul applied for the post again. He was rejected again due to his inexperience. He was instead appointed surgical tutor in 1930. A year later he applied for the Fifth Surgeon post for the third time but was again rejected. He was advised to obtain a MS qualification and so he returned to King's College London. Paul returned to Ceylon after obtaining his MS and took up a position as surgeon at the Civil Hospital in Jaffna in 1930. In 1937 he was finally appointed Fifth Surgeon at Colombo General Hospital. In 1937 he was appointed first professor of surgery at Ceylon Medical College, a position he held until his retirement. He continued to work at Colombo General Hospital and Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children during that time. Paul was the first Ceylonese to deliver the Hunterian Oration at the Royal College of Surgeons of England on three occasions ‚Äì The Surgical Anatomy of the Spermatic Cord (1950), Congenital Abnormalities of the Midline Abdominal Wall (1953) and Haemorrhages from Head Injuries (1955). He was also the first Ceylonese to become a member of the James IV Association of Surgeons. He was an honorary member of the Association of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland. He served as president of the Sri Lanka Medical Association and Registrar of the Ceylon Medical Council (1942‚Äì82). He was one of the founders of the International College of Surgeons and the Association of Surgeons of Sri Lanka. He was awarded honorary degrees by University of Colombo, University of Peradeniya and University of Jaffna. Paul was a member of the Volunteer Regiment of the Ceylon Medical Corps and rose to the rank of Major. He served in Ceylon Defence Force briefly during World War II. Paul died in 1989.

Playing career A 6ft7 forward, he started his career with Bracknell Pirates in 1986, where he spent two years before moving to the United States in 1988 to go to college at Hawaii Pacific University, where he was honoured as an All-American in 1993 by the NAIA. Following graduation in 1993, he unsuccessfully tried out for a career in the NBA and the Seattle SuperSonics before signing with Belgian team Gent for the 199‚Äì94 season. After one season, Huggins returned to England to sign for British Basketball League rookies Sheffield Sharks in their first season in the premier division, winning both the Championship and the National Cup, whilst Huggins himself was named as the League's Most Valuable Player and the English Basketball Association's Player of the Year for 1995. Two more successful seasons, including three consecutive appearances in the All-Star team (1995, 1996 and 1997), were spent at Sheffield where Huggins assured himself of a position as one of the most popular British players of all time. In 1997 Huggins returned to Belgium, signing for Antwerp Giants, where he spent three seasons, including appearing in the Koraƒá Cup. In 1999, he was awarded the English Basketball Association's Player of the Year for the second time. In his final season with Antwerp (1999-00), Huggins averaged 14.9 points-per-game in 23 appearances, whilst raising it to 16.6 points-per-game in 8 appearances in the Koraƒá Cup.http://en.basketball.doudiz.com/player/290/Roger-Huggins.html During his three seasons at Antwerp, he was also honoured on the Belgian League's All- Star team for 1998, 1999 and 2000. In 2000, Huggins moved to Athlon Ieper where he had an average of 17.7 points-per-game in 24 appearances, before moving to Israeli club Hapoel Jerusalem during the Spring of 2001 for the remainder of the season. Huggins played only 11 games in Jerusalem, but quickly became a fan favourite as he played an instrumental role in an upset of Maccabi Tel Aviv on his debut. He averaged 15.3 points and 5.7 rebounds over 28 minutes in seven playoff games that year as Jerusalem reached the Play-off finals. The following season Huggins returned to Belgium and moved to Spirou Charleroi who were competing in Europe's elite competition, the Euroleague, where he averaged a respectable 13.1 points-per-game over 29:49 minutes-per-game. Huggins' second season at Spirou was just as prominent and he averaged 9.3 points in 30 games domestically and 9.1 points in 11 games in the ULEB Cup. In 2003 he signed for Euphony Li√®ge scoring 11 points-per-game in 40 games and in 2004 he returned to Israel to sign with Bnei HaSharon who were appearing in the FIBA Europe League. Huggins featured heavily in the Group stage, averaging 10.9 points in 12 games, but halfway through the season he returned to Belgium to sign for former Sheffield teammate Chris Finch's side Euphony Bree. Two successful season's at Bree followed, including winning the Belgian League title in 2005, before Huggins returning to Li√®ge and Spirou in 2006 before being reunited with Coach Finch at Dexia Mons-Hainaut along with fellow Great Britain national team players Nate Reinking, Andrew Sullivan and Mike Lenzly for the 2007‚Äì08 season.

Birth date = . Birthplace = Saint Petersburg, Russia. Death date = . Death place = Hamburg, Germany. Lev Natanovich Lunts (; May 2, 1901 ‚Äì May 10, 1924) was a Russian playwright, proser and critic. He was a founding member of the Serapion Brothers (1921-1929), a group of young writers who emerged from the literary studio at the House of Arts in Petrograd. Highly active in the years 1919-1924, he completed five plays, two screenplays for the silent film, eight articles on the theater, one novella, a dozen stories and a dozen essays, in addition to learning languages, completing his undergraduate courses and participating in the lively activities of the Serapions. The harsh conditions of the time and his hectic literary activity thoroughly exhausted him and ruined his health, and he sought medical care abroad in June 1923. After several months in a sanatorium in southern Germany, he died of heart failure and a brain embolism in the city hospital of Hamburg, a week after his twenty-third birthday. After his death, his works were censored in Russia for the full extent of the Soviet period (1921-1991), but he was remembered for his daring defense of creative freedom against Bolshevik Party demands for political commitment. Finally in 2003 and 2007, well after the collapse of the Soviet Union, his complete works were published in Russia. A three-volume edition of his collected works appeared in English translation in 2014-2016. Biography Lunts was born in Saint Petersburg, the capital of the Russian Empire, into a middle-class Jewish family on May 2, 1901. His father, Natan Yakovlevich, an emigrant from Lithuania, was a pharmacist and seller of scientific instruments. His mother, Anna Efimovna, was an accomplished pianist. As a child, Lev was delicate but very lively; he contracted pneumonia and diphtheria, which may have weakened his heart. At a very early age he began to write humorous stories for the amusement of friends and family; in his teens, he was attracted to Western adventure novels and classical plays, especially of Italian and Spanish literature. Orlando Furioso by Ludovico Ariosto he considered a great discovery of his youth. He took his school work very seriously, and in the summer of 1918 graduated from the Petrograd First Gimnaziya with a gold medal. In September of the year he enrolled in the Philological Faculty (Romance- Germanic Department) of Petrograd University. Here he studied Italian, Spanish, German, French, Latin and the histories and literatures of these languages. His term papers were so outstanding that he was considered \\"a future light of science,\\" as Kornei Chukovsky recalled in his memoirs. Completing his courses in the spring of 1922, Lunts was retained for graduate school and began reading the novels of Balzac. His worsening health at the end of that year, however, compelled him to seek care in Germany, to which his parents had emigrated early in 1921. With a commission from the university to study Italian and Spanish in Europe, and recommendations from influential writers, he was permitted to leave Russia, and took a steamship to Hamburg on June 1, 1923.Kern, Gary, Lev Lunc: Serapion Brother (Princeton University, Ph.D dissertation, 1969).  Theater  Lunts was an experimental writer who tried a great variety of forms. His theatrical compositions present his most impressive body of work. He wrote five plays, two screenplays, a half-dozen articles on the theater and a couple of play reviews. As a fervent Westernizer among the Serapion Brothers, Lunts advocated that they learn from the adventure literature of Robert Louis Stevenson and Alexandre Dumas p√®re, and by way of example wrote two romantic plays filled with intrigue and action. Outside the Law (1920), set in an abstract, conventional Spain, presents a Robin Hood bandit who is declared by the authorities to be outside the law. He wittily turns this declaration into a formula for freedom, unpredictable action and revolution with himself as the leader of the masses. The hero of Bertrand de Born (1922) is a historical figure of the 12th century, a seditious troubadour at the court of King Henry II in Argentan, France. Lunts appended an afterword to the play presenting his credo of a new romantic tragedy for revolutionary times. The Apes Are Coming! (1920-1923), written under the influence of radical directors like Vsevolod Meyerhold and Sergei Radlov, is a wild burlesque of the Bolshevik revolution with a tumultuous conclusion that tears down the set. The last play, The City of Truth (1923), is a parable of the revolution in which homesick soldiers stumble into a calm and reasonable utopia, and get bored with the peace. His first play, The Son of the Sheik (1919), of which only fragments survive, concerns an ageing sheik who fears for the survival of his newborn son and heir. He therefore decides to keep him away from all women, including his mother, and even to prevent him from learning of the existence of a second sex. This situation provides the setup for a series of theatrical pieces (the expulsion of a loving wife, the worries of a doting father, the discovery of feminine charm by an innocent boy), which are treated in a stylized and humorous fashion. The manuscript states that the theme was taken from an Arabic legend. All four of the complete plays, despite their heterogeneity, explore the conflict between the individual's rage for freedom and society's need for order. Read separately, they evoke the excitement of the avant-garde theater in early post- revolutionary Russia, but taken together develop a philosophical theme to a surprising depth for a writer so young. Their theme of anarchic freedom vs. imposed social control carries over into Lunts's spectacular screenplay, Vostanie veshchei [Things In Revolt], a silent-film scenario discovered forty years after his death. Its basic idea is a revolt of inanimate objects to establish law and order over lawless and inconsistent mankind. Written in less than three weeks during the summer of 1923, while Lunts was gravely ill, it depicts a whole city of things moving by themselves and attacking people, both on the street and in their apartments. Decades had to pass before such a conception could be realized, and then only with CGI ‚îÄ computer generated images.Things In Revolt: The Theater of Lev Lunts (Xenos Books, 2014). His other screenplay, Zaveshchanie tsarya [The Tsar's Treasure], is closer to the typical silent films of the time, with a young Bolshevik hero trying to get a treasure map for the Reds and prevent the Whites from getting it to finance their counterrevolution. There are chases, motorcycle races, shootings. It is based on his single novella of the same name.  Prose  The prose of Lev Lunts consists of literary articles, polemical articles, book reviews, stories and the one novella. Although an atheist, Lunts was steeped in Jewish culture and dedicated to it. He expressed his Jewish concerns most openly in a letter sent to Maxim Gorky dated August 16, 1922: ‚ÄúWas I right in setting out into literature? Not that I do not believe in my powers: I believe in myself, perhaps too boldly. But I am a Jew. Convinced, steadfast, and glad of it. But I am a Russian writer. And then I am a Russian Jew. Russia is my native land, I love Russia above all countries. How can one reconcile these things? For myself I have reconciled everything, for me all this is plain and clear, but others think differently. Others say: ‚ÄòA Jew cannot be a Russian writer...‚Äô‚Äù In the Wilderness: The Prose of Lev Lunts (Xenos Books, 2014), 3. Lunts's concerns with his Jewish heritage are revealed in three stories written in a Biblical style that draw on separate episodes from the Jewish Bible (the Old Testament), but give them a modern and even post-revolutionary slant. They are: ‚ÄúIn the Wilderness‚Äù (March 1921), ‚ÄúThe Castrate‚Äù (Dec. 1921) and ‚ÄúThe Homeland‚Äù (July 1922). Each creates its own intonation and system of refrains, and each uses Biblical material or classical sources, such as Herodotus, for its own purposes. A different purpose can be seen in each story, and a different approach to the short-story genre. The first describes the Jews of Exodus dragging through the desert, starving and groaning under the whips of Aaron and the Levites, then rebelling. The second is most mysterious, as it concerns a castrate with childish laughter who wins the maternal heart of a man's barren wife, is adopted by her, and thus overcomes adversity. The story has parallels with the Book of Ruth and also with his own essay, \\"Detskii smekh\\" (Children's Laughter), which glorifies that laughter as pure innocence. The third story is autobiographical science-fiction, involving a time warp inside a synagogue and the transmigration of Lunts and his friend Veniamin Kaverin to ancient Babylon, where their alienation as Jews in Petrograd becomes more manifest.All three stories are translated in the collection In the Wilderness: The Prose of Lev Lunts (Xenos Books, 2014). One or another of these stories has been anthologized in collections of Jewish literature. The first one, \\"In the Wilderness,\\" can be read in English online.\\"In the Wilderness\\" online : http://home.earthlink.net/~gwkern/Lunts.htm The other stories pose a sharp contrast to the Biblical, being sketches and satires of the new Soviet society. ‚ÄúOutgoing No. 37‚Äù takes aim at the petty bureaucrat uplifted by revolutionary ideals. The long epistolary story, ‚ÄúCrossing the Border,‚Äù mixes Jewish subjects with Soviet reality, with the result that the actions of nearly all of the characters are completely illogical. Lunts places himself in the story as a trickster who gets everyone into trouble. The story ‚ÄúThe Man in a Coat‚Äù emphasizes this irrational and even demonic element, drawing on Gogol's classic stories ‚ÄúNevsky Prospekt‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Overcoat.‚Äù A bathroom story called ‚ÄúA Patriot‚Äù draws on the tradition of showing Russians befuddled by Western inventiveness, in this case a pay toilet in the Berlin train station. Lunts also wrote a couple of skaz pieces, little stories illustrating the street argot of ordinary people, in this case a fickle woman with pretensions to culture (French expressions). They appear to draw inspiration from stories of seduction by Maupassant. His longest work of prose is Zaveshchanie tsarya [The Tsar's Treasure], a novella in twenty-two chapters dating from late 1922 to early 1923. Previously unpublished, it was rescued from the archive and printed for the first time in Moscow in 2007. The screenplay based on the novella is all action and emotion in the manner of early silent films, but the novella, while moving swiftly, is complex, psychological and challenging. Within a strongly developed plot and a standard battle of Reds vs. Whites, it presents scenes of early Soviet society unlike any in the Socialist Realism literature that followed. The themes of rape and revenge, sadism, masochism, Bolshevik naivete, homosexuality, Jewish upbringing, poverty and filth in the capital are combined with a sincere attempt to portray the experience of young people growing up in the Revolution and Civil War. The result is awkward and unsettling, but strikingly realistic. In 2009, a collection of stories by the Serapion Brothers that had been filed in 1921 and lost in a Finnish archive was rediscovered. Funding was obtained, and in 2013 the whole collection was published in Russian under the title Serapionovy brat'ya: Al'manakh 1921 [The Serapion Brothers: Almanac 1921] (St. Petersburg: Limbus Press, 2013). Some of the stories had been published elsewhere in their time, but the story by Lunts, entitled Bunt [The Rebellion] and dated May 1921, was entirely \\"new.\\" Its content was unexpected. Like the novella, it is both realistic and psychological, but it is also militaristic. It describes a town taken over by the Bolsheviks whose residents launch a frontal attack on the Party headquarters, boxing in the hero and his son.The story is translated as \\"The Zhakhov Rebellion\\" in Journey On A Hospital Bed: Lev Lunts & The Serapion Brothers\\" (Xenos Books, 2016), 305-318. This story and the novella show that Lunts could write battle scenes and draw military characters as well as fellow Serapions who had been in uniform and fought in World War I or in the Russian Civil War. (Lunts was exempted by his weak heart.) The frequent characterization of Lunts as young and bookish that occurs in the literature is based on only one side of his diverse output.  Articles and essays  One of Lunts's university papers was also published for the first time in 2007, a lengthy analysis of the French revolutionary poet Henri Auguste Barbier (1805-1882), a stirring poet who lived long past his time. Another insightful analysis is the paper on Pierre de Marivaux (1688-1763), whose \\"game of love\\" plots worked so well in plays, but were deadly boring in novels. Lunts published this essay, \\"Marivaudage,\\" in 1919. His book review of a translation into Russian of Dante's treatise De vulgari eloquio, published in 1922, also gives evidence of his university studies. There are other reviews and articles among his works that are expert and varied, including assessments of poets, but Lunts did not live to write a book-length study or collection of essays. During the Cold War Lunts was known to professors and students of Russian literature abroad as the author of daring polemical articles that aroused the most powerful Bolshevik critics against him. The chief articles are ‚ÄúWhy We Are the Serapion Brothers,‚Äù ‚ÄúOn Ideology and Promotional Literature‚Äù and ‚ÄúGo West!,‚Äù all from 1922. Their message was simple: ideological regimentation produces bad literature, writers must have the freedom to write what they want, such writing is more alive and exciting to readers than what is dictated from above. The Serapion Brothers, said Lunts, accepted all literature that was written well, regardless of its ideology, and debated the merits of each work from their individual perspectives. Toward the end of the first article, which was often taken as the manifesto of the group, Lunts declared: \\"Too long and painfully has social commitment ruled Russian literature. It is time to say that a non-Communist story may lack talent, but also may possess genius. And we do not care with whom stood Blok, the poet, author of ‚ÄúThe Twelve,‚Äù or Bunin, the prosaist, author of ‚ÄúThe Gentleman from San Francisco.‚Äù \\"These are ABC truths, but every day convinces us that they must be repeated again and again. \\"With whom, then, are we, Serapion Brothers? \\"We are with the hermit Serapion. We believe that literary chimeras have a special reality. We do not want utilitarianism. We do not write for propaganda. Art is real, like life itself. And, like life itself, it is without goal and without meaning: it exists because it cannot help but exist.\\" The second article answered critics of the first and raised the question whether readers in the Soviet Union would be permitted to read writers with bad ideology, such as Kipling and Shakespeare. The third article, \\"Go West!\\" (Dec. 1922), was a long speech delivered to the Serapions. Here Lunts argued that too many Russian writers were lazy and self-satisfied; they were barbarians who needed to study plot and structure from Western masters. Again, he asserted that plot, action and good composition would win the approval of proletarian readers and theatergoers sooner than would a proper political message. He provided a survey of Russian literature from the point of view of the development of plot. Party critics, including the head of the censorship board, debated with Lunts in print. The Commissar of Education banned his plays. The Party closed down the House of Arts and turned it into an apartment complex, in large part because of the free spirit of the Serapion Brothers, who held their meetings there. Lunts did not recant, but died young, so that his arguments remained inviolate for the extent of the Soviet period. The American scholar Victor Erlich characterized these arguments as ‚Äúthe most forthright plea for creative freedom to be found in the annals of Soviet literature.\\" Victor Erlich, Russian Formalism: History ‚Äì Doctrine (Mouton: The Hague, 1965), 150. After his death, Lunts's works were suppressed, but strangely also publicized. In 1946, to stifle the people's expectation of increased freedom after World War II, and to kill a lingering nostalgia for the colorful literary life and unrestricted debates of the early Soviet period, the Party seized on the Serapion Brothers and its so-called ‚Äúmanifesto.‚Äù All the writers but Lunts were still alive, but no longer working together as a literary group. Some were prominent members of the Union of Soviet Writers and enjoyed wide readerships. Party spokesman Andrei Zhdanov (1896-1948), formally addressing the Soviet writers in Leningrad, quoted Lunts (as above) and declared: ‚ÄúThis is the preaching of rotten apoliticism, philistinism and vulgarity.‚Äù He proceeded to attack the most popular writer among the former Serapions, Mikhail Zoshchenko (1894-1958), characterizing him as a decadent anti-Soviet malcontent and instantly destroying his career. Thus he served notice that the party was resuming its prewar policies and would not tolerate free-thinking writers. Zhdanov's speech entered the curriculum of the literature departments in all the Soviet universities and remained there to be read year after year up to the abolition of the Soviet program of education. Thus, inadvertently, the Party kept alive a portion of Lunts's words and thought, and suggested a freedom that had been lost. Russian scholar Mariya Chudakova observed: ‚ÄúLunts was not read (there was nowhere to read him), but he was always recalled whenever the subject turned to the 1920s ‚îÄ in articles, monographs, lectures, presentations and private judgements of other people‚Äôs works on the literary history of that time.‚Äù M.O.

Former Serapions Konstantin Fedin (1892-1977), Mikhail Slonimsky (1897-1972) and Veniamin Kaverin (1902-1989), in particular, when writing their memoirs in the 1960s, unfailingly recalled the Serapion Brothers and Lunts. A commission was formed in 1967, headed by the journalist Solomon Podolsky (1900-1974), to collect all of Lunts's works, together with the literature about him, and to publish a commemorative volume, thus finally to realize the plan of the \\"brothers\\" that was snuffed out in the Stalin-Zhdanov years. But repeatedly the plan ran into opposition from the conservative literary establishment. Kaverin managed to republish Lunts's last play, Gorod Pravdy [The City of Truth], in a theatrical journal in 1989, one year after he had helped to effect the first publication in the Soviet Union of Yevgeny Zamyatin's anti- utopian novel, My [We, 1920]. The censorship board was beginning to crack, but still the Lunts collection was delayed beyond the life of the last Serapion (Kaverin) and the end of the Soviet system.The story is told by Boris Frezinsky, ‚ÄúZakoldovannye sochineniya L‚Äôva Luntsa‚Äù [The Spellbound Works of Lev Lunts], Zvezda [The Star] No. 12, 1997, 151; also ‚ÄúZakoldovannaya kniga, ili Bremya pamyati‚Äù [The Spellbound Book, or the Burden of Memory], in Sud‚Äôby Serapionov: Portrety i syuzhety [The Fates of the Serapions: Portraits & Particulars] (St. Petersburg: Akademicheskii proekt, 2003), 428-472.

She married, moved to England and became Genia Hornstein (1908-1971). She kept the suitcase unopened through the war years. Early in 1964 she opened it and shared unpublished materials with a visiting graduate student from Manchester University, Gary Kern, who sorted them into folders and used them in his dissertation on Lunts and the Serapion Brothers. In 1965, through the agency of Nina Berberova (1901-1993), she donated the collection to Yale University. The Lev Lunts Papers Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library P.O.

Life  Anna was the eldest child of the Count Palatine Rupert of Veldenz (1506‚Äì1544) from his marriage to Ursula (1515‚Äì1601), daughter of Wild- and Rhinegrave John VII of Salm-Kyrburg. She married Charles II, Margrave of Baden-Durlach on the first of August 1558 in Heidelberg; it was his second marriage. Like her husband, Anna held a Lutheran faith and the children from both his marriages were also raised as Lutherans. =Regency= When her husband died, his sons were still minors. Therefore, she acted as guardian and regent from 1577 until her son Ernest Frederick came of age in 1584. Her co-regents were Elector Palatine Louis VI and Duke Louis \\"the Pious\\" of W√ºrttemberg. In 1584, Baden-Durlach was split: her eldest son Ernest Frederick, received the largest part and became Margrave of Baden-Durlach. Her second son James received Baden-Hachberg and had his residence at Emmendingen. He converted to Catholicism in 1590 and reverted his territory to the Catholic faith. However, a short while later, he died of arsenic poisoning and Baden-Hachberg fell to his brother Ernest Frederick. When Ernest Frederick died in 1604, all parts of Baden were reunited under his brother George Frederick.

It consists of a reusable armband, wearable over many hazardous-material suits, on which removable sensors are mounted. The sensors have color-changing tags that indicate the presence of hazardous or dangerous chemicals in the air, allowing personnel in the field to make decisions about dangerous situations. Development The Chameleon was developed by Morphix Technologies during the early 2000s. Morphix Technologies won a Small Business Development and Research grant in 2002 to design a device that could indicate the presence of dangerous gasses or vapors cheaply, easily, and quickly. The design for the armband came from requests from military who needed it to be unobtrusive, while the replaceable sensor part (cassette) came from a need to keep it affordable for police and emergency responders. Benefits The Chameleon can be used in high temperatures, arctic cold, in the desert, or even after being submerged in water, and still detect up to one-part-per billion of dangerous air-borne hazards. After opening the sensors, they have a 24-hour life-time before function begins to be hampered. Components =The armband= The Chameleon‚Äôs lightweight and unobtrusive armband has room for ten of the eleven sensor cassettes that are currently produced, and can easily swap out used sensors for quick replacements. It was designed with military and emergency situations in mind, and can be easily put on or taken off, with enough adjustment to be able to fit easily over even the highest level of hazardous material protective gear. =The sensors= The Chameleon sensors function similarly to litmus paper. The cassettes that hold the sensors are mounted onto the armband, and can be easily removed. The cassettes have a small viewing window that shows a uniform colored surface when not exposed to its particular trigger. Once exposed to it, half of the viewing window will change color, presenting a contrast that allows users to recognize that a threat is present. The sensors detect acidic and basic gases, ammonia, chlorine/fluorine, diborane, hydrazine, hydrogen sulfide, iodine, phosgene, phosphine, and sulfur dioxide. After opening, they retain functionality for up to twenty-four hours. The sensors come packaged in groups that allow them to be easily changed out depending on the scenario. These groups are Chemical Suicide, Clan-Meth Lab, or Haz-Mat detection, which are the most common configurations used. Uses *Chemical Suicide ‚Äîthe combining of common household chemicals to create a toxic gas as a suicide method‚Äîis not only a danger to the person attempting the suicide, but also to others in the vicinity, or police who respond to the scene. *Methamphetamine production can release toxic gas when done wrong, and police need to be informed before they put themselves in danger. *Emergency crews and first responders use the Chameleon when arriving at sites of industrial accidents, where they do not know the extent of damage done or dangers present. In addition to being worn directly, the idea exists of mounting the Chameleon onto Aerial Drones or Ground Drones to further extend its utility in certain situations. The Chameleon won the 2007 Innovation Awards from Law Enforcement Product News in the category of ‚ÄúHaz-mat/WMD‚Äù.Law Enforcement Product News References * Connolly, Allison. ‚ÄúBeach Company Develops low-cost chemical detection device‚Äù.

Early life Alalasundaram was from Nayanmarkaddu near Nallur in northern Ceylon. He studied in Madras and after graduation became a teacher. Career Alalasundaram stood as the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi's (Federal Party) candidate in Kilinochchi at the 1970 parliamentary election but was defeated by the All Ceylon Tamil Congress (ACTC) candidate V. Anandasangaree. On 14 May 1972 the ITAK, ACTC, Ceylon Workers' Congress, Eelath Thamilar Otrumai Munnani and All Ceylon Tamil Conference formed the Tamil United Front, later renamed Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF). In March 1981 S. Kathiravelupillai, the TULF MP for Kopay, died and Alalasundaram was nominated by the TULF as his replacement. Alalasundaram entered Parliament after being sworn in on 23 July 1981. Alalasundaram and all other TULF MPs boycotted Parliament from the middle of 1983 for a number of reasons: they were under pressure from Sri Lankan Tamil militants not to stay in Parliament beyond their normal six-year term; the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka required them to swear an oath unconditionally renouncing support for a separate state; and the Black July riots in which up to 3,000 Tamils were murdered by Sinhalese mobs. After three months of absence, Alalasundaram forfeited his seat in Parliament on 5 January 1984. Many leading Tamil politicians fled to Madras but Alalasundaram was one of the few who remained in Sri Lanka. He stayed at his house near Nallur documenting the growing violence. On 22 February 1983 Alalasundaram was shot and injured after a heated argument with three or four youths at his house. =Assassination= On the night of 2/3 September 1985 two men went to the house of Alalasundaram at Kalliyankadu, Nallur and kidnapped him at gun point. They took Alalasundaram in a car and drove to Uduvil where V. Dharmalingam, former MP for Manipay, was attending a wedding. The men then kidnapped Dharmalingam as well. The next day Alalasundaram's body was found in a scrub jungle near his home at Kalliyankadu with bullet wounds in the chest and arm. Dharmalingam's body was found at a cemetery in Thavady, Manipay, with a bullet wound in the forehead. No one claimed responsibility for the assassinations. Dharmalingam's son Siddhartan, who is a member of the People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam militant group, blamed one of the members of Eelam National Liberation Front for the assassinations (PLOTE wasn't a member of ENLF). It is widely believed that the murders were carried out by Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO), an Indian backed militant group, on the orders of the Research and Analysis Wing, the Indian intelligence agency. Alalasundaram was close to the TELO and a relative of its leader Sri Sabaratnam. It is believed that TELO chose to murder Alalasundaram at the same time as Dharmalingam so as to avoid suspicion. According to Siddhartan and K. T. Rajasingham the TELO assassins had been led by Bobby but others claim that it was Das. However, the Sri Lankan government and other Sinhalese Buddhist nationalists have repeatedly blamed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) for the assassinations. As recently as 2013 the Sri Lankan military was falsely blaming the LTTE for the assassinations.

Remaining in Nagasaki, some of them reverted to Judaism, even reclaiming their family names (notably a Levite). In 1586, the community, then consisting of at least three permanent families, was displaced by the Shimazu forces. The Jews of Settsu absorbed some of them into its own community (at the time, a population of over 130 Jews), while a minority left or died. = Jewish settlements in Edo Japan = Between 1848 and 1854, in Naha, Satsuma province, Bernard Jean Bettelheim (physician), a Jewish British national resided with his family. There is a plaque at Gokokuji Jinja (Naha). In 1861, Pogrom refugees from Russia and Poland moved to the port of Nagasaki; these were the first Jews in Nagasaki since around 1584. In 1867, over one week the Settsu Jewish community was pushed near extinction, disappearing altogether after the Meiji restoration. Towards the end of the Edo period, with the arrival of Commodore Matthew Perry following the Convention of Kanagawa and the end of Japan's \\"closed-door\\" foreign policy, Jewish families again began to settle in Japan. The first recorded Jewish settlers arrived at Yokohama in 1861. By 1895, this community, which by then consisted of about 50 families, established the first synagogue in Meiji Japan.Daniel Ari Kapner and Stephen Levine, \\"The Jews of Japan,\\" Jerusalem Letter, No. 425 24 Adar I 5760 / 1 March 2000, Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs. Part of this community would later move to Kobe after the great Kanto earthquake of 1923. Another early Jewish settlement was established in the 1880s in Nagasaki, a large Japanese port city opened to foreign trade by the Portuguese. This community was larger than the one in Yokohama, consisting of more than 100 families. It was here that the Beth Israel Synagogue was created in 1894. The settlement would continually grow and remain active until it eventually declined by the Russo-Japanese War in the early 20th century. The community's Torah scroll would eventually be passed down to the Jews of Kobe, a group formed of freed Russian Jewish war prisoners that had participated in the Czar's army and the Russian Revolution of 1905. Beth Israel Synagogue in Nagasaki From the mid 1920s until the 1950s, the Kobe Jewish community was the largest Jewish community in Japan, formed by hundreds of Jews arriving from Russia (originating from the Manchurian city of Harbin), the Middle East (mainly from Iraq and Syria), as well as from Central and Eastern European countries (primarily Germany). It had both an Ashkenazi and a Sephardic synagogue. During this time, Tokyo's Jewish community (now Japan's largest) was slowly growing with the arrival of Jews from the United States, Western Europe, and Russia. = Jewish settlement in Imperial Japan = In 1905, at the end of the Russo-Japanese War, the community of Nagasaki went extinct. While the Iraqi community is formed in Kobe (about 40 families in 1941) Following Russia's 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, anti-Semitism exploded in Japan, with many blaming Jews as being the \\"nature\\" of the revolution. Some Japanese leaders, such as Captain Inuzuka Koreshige (Áä¨Â°ö ÊÉüÈáç), Colonel Yasue Norihiro (ÂÆâÊ±ü ‰ªôÂºò), and industrialist Aikawa Yoshisuke (ÈÆéÂ∑ù Áæ©‰ªã), came to believe that Jewish economic and political power could be harnessed by Japan through controlled immigration, and that such a policy would also ensure favor from the United States through the influence of American Jewry. Although efforts were made to attract Jewish investment and immigrants, the plan was limited by the government's desire not to interfere with its alliance with Nazi Germany. Ultimately, it was left up to the world Jewish community to fund the settlements and to supply settlers and the plan failed to attract a significant long-term population or create the strategic benefits for Japan that had been expected by its originators. In 1937, Japan invaded China, with the Japanese ambassador to France telling the ruling Japanese that \\"English, American, and French Jewish plutocrats\\" were leading opposition to the invasion. On December 6, 1938, Five ministers council (Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe, Army Minister Seishir≈ç Itagaki, Navy Minister Mitsumasa Yonai, Foreign Minister Hachir≈ç Arita, and Finance Minister Shigeaki Ikeda), which was the highest decision-making council, made a decision of prohibiting the expulsion of the Jews in Japan. With the signing of the German-Japanese Anti-COMINTERN Pact in 1936 and the Tripartite Treaty of September 1940, however, anti- Semitism gained a more formal footing in some of Tokyo's ruling circles. Meanwhile, the Japanese public was exposed to a campaign of defamation that created a popular image known as the Yudayaka, or the \\"Jewish peril.\\" During World War II, Japan was regarded by some as a safe refuge from the Holocaust, despite being a part of the Axis and an ally of Germany. Jews trying to escape German-occupied Poland could not pass the blockades near the Soviet Union and the Mediterranean Sea and were forced to go through the neutral country of Lithuania (which was occupied by belligerents in June 1940, starting with the Soviet Union, then Germany, and then the Soviet Union again). Of those who arrived, many (around 5,000) were sent to the Dutch West Indies with Japanese visas issued by Chiune Sugihara, the Japanese consul to Lithuania. Sugihara ignored his orders and gave thousands of Jews entry visas to Japan, risking his career and saving more than 6,000 lives. Sugihara is said to have cooperated with Polish intelligence, as part of a bigger Japanese-Polish cooperative plan. They managed to flee across the vast territory of Russia by train to Vladivostok and then by boat to Kobe in Japan. The refugees 2,185 in number arrived in Japan from August 1940 to June 1941. Tadeusz Romer, the Polish ambassador in Tokyo, had managed to get transit visas in Japan; asylum visas to Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Burma; immigration certificates to Palestine; and immigrant visas to the United States and some Latin American countries. Most Jews were permitted and encouraged to move on from Japan to the Shanghai Ghetto, China, under Japanese occupation for the duration of World War II. Finally, Tadeusz Romer arrived in Shanghai on November 1, 1941, to continue the action for Jewish refugees.Andrzej Guryn, \\"Tadeusza Romera Pomoc ≈ªydom Polskim na Dalekim Wschodzie,\\" Biuletyn Polskiego Instytutu Naukowego w Kanadzie, vol X,1993 (in Polish) Among those saved in the Shanghai Ghetto were leaders and students of Mir yeshiva, the only European yeshiva to survive the Holocaust. They some 400 in number fled from Mir to Vilna with the outbreak of World War II in 1939, and then to Keidan, Lithuania. In late 1940, they obtained visas from Chiune Sugihara, to travel from Keidan (then Lithuanian SSR) via Siberia and Vladivostok to Kobe, Japan. By November 1941, the Japanese moved this group and most of others on to the Shanghai Ghetto in order to consolidate the Jews under their control.Pamela Shatzkes. Kobe: A Japanese haven for Jewish refugees, 1940‚Äì1941. Japan Forum, 1469-932X, Volume 3, Issue 2, 1991, pp. 257‚Äì273 The secretary of the Manchurian Legation in Berlin Wang Tifu (Áéã, ÊõøÂ§´. 1911-) also issued visas to 12,000 refugees, including Jews, from June 1939 to May 1940. Throughout the war, the Japanese government continually rejected some requests from the German government to establish anti-Semitic policies. However, some Jews who resided in Japanese- occupied territories were interned in detention camps in Malaysia and the Netherlands East Indies. Jews in the Philippines were also faced accusations of being involved in black market operations, price manipulation, and espionage. Towards the end, Nazi representatives pressured the Japanese army to devise a plan to exterminate Shanghai's Jewish population and this pressure eventually became known to the Jewish community's leadership. However, the Japanese had no intention of further provoking the anger of the Allies and thus delayed the German request for a time, eventually rejecting it entirely. One Orthodox Jewish institution saved in this manner was the Lithuanian Haredi Mir yeshiva. The Japanese government and people offered the Jews temporary shelter, medical services, food, transportation, and gifts, but preferred that they move on to reside in Japanese-occupied Shanghai. The decision to declare the Shanghai Ghetto in February 1943 was influenced by the police attach√© of the German embassy in Tokyo, Josef Meisinger. In autumn 1942 he had lengthy discussions with the Japanese Home Ministry. Because the Japanese were mostly not anti-Semitic, he used their espionage fear to provoke actions against the Jewish community. To the Japanese he declared, that he was ordered from Berlin to provide them all names of \\"anti-Nazis\\" among the German residents. Then he claimed that \\"anti-Nazis\\" were always \\"anti-Japanese\\" and added that \\"anti- Nazis\\" were primarily German Jews, of whom 20,000 had emigrated to Shanghai. Meisinger's anti-Semitic intrigue worked. In response to his statements, the Japanese demanded from Meisinger a list of all \\"anti-Nazis\\". This list was, as Meisinger's personal secretary later confirmed, already prepared. After consulting General M√ºller, Meisinger handed the list over to the Japanese Home Ministry and the Kenpeitai at the end of 1942. The list contained i. a. the names of all Jews with a German passport in Japan. Karl Hamel, the interpreter of Meisinger, who was present at the discussions with the Japanese authorities, later testified that this intervention led to a \\"real chasing of anti-Nazis\\" and to the \\"internment of quite a lot of people\\". He added that \\"this thesis may be regarded as the basic explanation of Mr. Meisinger‚Äôs activities in Japan with regard to the splitting up of the German Community into Nazis and anti-Nazis.\\" This testimony of Karl Hamel to Allied interrogation specialists was kept strictly confidential for a long time. During lawsuits for compensation of inmates of the Shanghai Ghetto in the 1950s, former German diplomats were able to convince the judges, that the proclamation of the ghetto was a sovereign act of the Japanese and not related to German authorities.Jochem, Clemens: Der Fall Foerster: Die deutsch- japanische Maschinenfabrik in Tokio und das J√ºdische Hilfskomitee Hentrich & Hentrich, Berlin 2017, pp. 82‚Äì90 and pp. 229‚Äì233, . At war's end, about half of the Jews who had been in Japanese-controlled territories later moved on to the Western hemisphere (such as the United States and Canada) and the remainder moved to other parts of the world, mainly to Israel. Since the 1920s, there have been occasional events and statements reflecting antisemitism in Japan,Jacob Kovalio, The Russian Protocols of Zion in Japan: Yudayaka/Jewish Peril Propaganda and Debates in the 1920s, Vol. 64 of Asian Thought and Culture, Peter Lang, 2009 generally promoted by fringe elements and tabloid newspapers.  Jews and Judaism in modern Japan  After World War II, a large portion of the few Jews that were in Japan left, many going to what would become Israel. Some of those who remained married locals and were assimilated into Japanese society. Presently, there are several hundred Jewish families living in Tokyo, and a small number of Jewish families in and around Kobe. A small number of Jewish expatriates of other countries live throughout Japan, temporarily, for business, research, a gap year, or a variety of other purposes. There are always Jewish members of the United States Armed Forces serving on Okinawa and in the other American military bases throughout Japan. Camp Foster in Okinawa has a dedicated Jewish Chapel where the Jewish Community of Okinawa has been worshipping since the 1980s. Actually, Okinawa has had a continuous presence of Rabbis, serving as military Chaplains, for the past 4 decades. There are community centers serving Jewish communities in Tokyo and Kobe. The Chabad-Lubavitch organization has two official centers in Tokyo and in Kobe and there is an additional Chabad house run by Rabbi Yehezkel Binyomin Edery. In the cultural domain, each year, hundreds, if not thousands, of Jews visit the Chiune Sugihara Memorial Museum located in Yaotsu, Gifu Prefecture, in central Japan. Chiune Sugihara's grave in Kamakura is the place where Jewish visitors pay their respect. Sugihara's actions of issuing valid transit visas are thought to have saved the lives of around 6,000 Jews, who fled across Russia to Vladivostok and then Japan to escape the concentration camps. In the same prefecture, many Jews also visit Takayama city.

Description The shell has a typical trochoid shape with a spire angle of approximately 72 degrees and nearly smooth sided until the body whorls which are slightly inflated at the shoulder with a rounded periphery. The base is moderately convex to flat, and the shell has a large nacreous (pearly) columellar callus which covers about one third of the base and can be keeled at its outer margin. The aperture is oval, the slit is positioned mid whorl and is long, about 16 to 20 percent of the circumference. The shell is heavily textured with about 20 spiral cords crossed by numerous fine crescent shaped axial growth lines above the selenizone (the area where the shell growth filled in the slit) and about 10 spiral cords below. The shell is creamy yellow overlaid with many crimson axial flammules above and below the selenizone which has yellowish orange crescent shaped growth marks, the base is a pale creamy yellow with occasional light crimson flammules, and the interior of the aperture is nacreous. The shell is occasionally found with part of its dark brown periostracum near the margin opposite the aperture. The operculum is small, dark brown, multispiral, and chitinous. Size range: 45 to 129 mm diameter.Anseeuw, P. & Goto, Y., The Living Pleurotomariidae (1996), Elle Scientific Publications, Osaka Japan, pp. 202, at pp. 98-99.Original description: Henry A.

It is situated between two long sills in the Superior Upland, causing the lake to be eight times longer east and west than it is north and south. Out of the opposite ends flow the Temperance River and the South Brule, a tributary of the Brule River. Brule Lake was logged heavily in the early 1900s, and the region around it was consumed in 1929 by a logging-related forest fire which bears Brule Lake's name. Now the lake is part of the protected Boundary Waters Canoe Area, a federal wilderness area for which Brule Lake serves as an entrance point. Topography Brule Lake is one of the largest lakes in the eastern Arrowhead Region of Minnesota.Minnesota Game and Fish Department. Fins, Feathers and Fur. vol. 29‚Äì54. p.43 Sept. 1925. It has an area of 4272 acres, and a maximum depth of 78 feet. It sits 1851 feet above sea level.Minnesota State Drainage Commission. Report of the Water Resources Investigation of Minnesota, 1911‚Äì1912. p.569. McGill-Warner, 1912. It measures approximately eight miles from east to west, and one mile from north to south.Grant, U.S., \\"Lakes With Two Outlets in Northern Minnesota\\", p. 408. The American Geologist, Volume 19, 1897. Brule Lake is located in the Duluth Complex, a geological region marked by bands of softer, more erodible bedrock, and \\"red rock,\\" a harder and less easily eroded stone, which forms protruding ridges across the Superior Uplands.Steeg, Karl ver. \\"The Influence of Geologic Structure on the Drainage Pattern in Northeastern Minnesota.\\" The Journal of Geology, p. 353. Vol. 55, No. 4 (Jul. 1947) In the region of the Brule, these ridges run nearly exactly east-west, and long, thin lakes lie between them. The valley in which Brule Lake is located is bound on the north by the Misquah Hills, and on the south by another sill peaked by Brule Mountain. Though the distance between these points is only four miles, the valley is six hundred feet deep.Berkey, Chas P. \\"Preliminary Report of the Levelling Party.\\" Annual Report, for the Year 1881. Ed. Winchell, N. H. Geological and Natural History Survey of Minnesota. p. 136. St. Paul, 1882. Brule Mountain, Misquah Hill (Point 2230), and Eagle Mountain are all prominent red rock monadnocks surrounding Brule Lake.Steeg, Karl ver. \\"The Influence of Geologic Structure on the Drainage Pattern in Northeastern Minnesota.\\" The Journal of Geology, Vol. 55, No. 4 (Jul. 1947), p. 355. Misquah Hill was erroneously identified as the highest point in Minnesota during the 1890s, until the United States Department of the Interior resurveyed in 1961, concluding that Eagle Mountain was taller by 74 feet.Summit plaque, Eagle Mountain, Minnesota Historical Society, 1967 Brule Lake is the source of both the Temperance and the South Brule Rivers. The Temperance drains from the west side of the lake, and flows some thirty miles until entering Lake Superior near Tofte. The South Brule drains from the east and flows some forty miles until entering Lake Superior forty three miles northeast of the mouth of the Temperance. The Temperance and Brule have the fourth and third largest catchment areas of any stream entering Lake Superior in Minnesota.Eberhart, Adolph Olson; Ralph, Georg A.; Follansbee, Robert. Report of the Water Resources Investigation of Minnesota, 1911‚Äì1912. p. 521. Separated from the mainland by these two watersheds are the Poplar, Cascade, and Devil Track rivers, which drain a total of slightly over 300 square miles of land themselves. Plant and animal life Brule Lake was stocked for walleye prior to 1985, and presently supports a self-sustained population.Brule Lake information report, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, 2009. Retrieved May 23, 2012. Smaller walleye's major forage, yellow perch, are small in number in Brule. This limits the size of the walleye population, although once they grow large enough they can forage on Brule's much larger cisco population. Northern pike and smallmouth bass are also sport fish found in this lake. The 2009 survey also turned up white sucker. In February 1926, the Minnesota Game and Fish department organized a survey of the Brule and Winchell lakes region, which reported a heavy presence of moose, a comparatively light presence of deer, also timber wolves, foxes, mink, and the trail of a Canadian lynx.Brule Lake Trek Appeals to Many. p. 68. Fins, Feathers, and Fur, Official Bulletin of the Minnesota Game and Fish Department. No 44, March 1926. Human use Brule Lake lies in a region which has seen human population since the end of the last ice age. It has variously been within the territory of the Dakota, Cree, Ojibwa, French, British, and Americans.Wilbers, Steven. Boundary Waters Chronology Accessed May 21, 2012. It saw little development until the opening of a railroad that allowed loggers easier access to the interior of the Arrowhead region's dense pine forest. A survey of the region was made by Ulysses S. Grant II and Newton Horace Winchell in 1893, which established the surface elevation of the Brule and the heights of many of the hills around it.Berkey, Chas P. \\"Preliminary Report of the Levelling Party.\\" Annual Report, for the Year 1881. Ed. Winchell, N. H. Geological and Natural History Survey of Minnesota. p. 134. St. Paul, 1882. In 1898, the Duluth and Northern Minnesota Railroad was opened to service the logging firm of Alger, Smith Company, and in time a spur of this railroad was built to Lake Brule.Wolff, Julius F. \\"Some Vanished Settlements of the Arrowhead Country.\\" Minnesota History. v. 34, p. 181. Around 1920, the General Logging Company had acquired the rights to stands of white pine in the region of Brule Lake from the Alger, Smith Company.Wolff, Julius F. \\"Some Major Forest Fires in the Sawbill Country.\\" Minnesota History, Vol. 36, No. 4 (Dec. 1958). p. 132. Laws requiring the removal of pine slash were not being effectively enforced in the region, increasing the danger of forest fire. On July 22, 1929, a fire was spotted between Brule and Star Lake.Wolff, Julius F. \\"Some Major Forest Fires in the Sawbill Country.\\" Minnesota History, Vol. 36, No. 4 (Dec. 1958). p. 133. Twenty one days later, the Brule Lake Fire had burned 25,708 acres of forest, cost $20,000 to extinguish, and demonstrated the insufficiency of the United States Forest Service's firefighting capacity in the region.Wolff, Julius F. \\"Some Major Forest Fires in the Sawbill Country.\\" Minnesota History, Vol. 36, No. 4 (Dec. 1958). p. 134. With the decline of the lumber industry between 1920 and 1940, many lumber railways were dismantled, including the Alger line.Ryan, J. C. \\"Minnesota Logging Railroads\\" Minnesota History.

In 1925, an unauthorized canal was blasted between Brule Lake and the South Brule River, while a dam was built to close off its outlet into the Temperance.\\"Northern Lakes Present Varied Problems\\". p. 43. Fins, Feathers, and Fur, Official Bulletin of the Minnesota Game and Fish Department. No 43, September 1925. These were later repaired, using nearby boulders, brush, and two bags of cement.Brule Lake Trek Appeals to Many. p. 67.

During the 1920s, Edward Wellington Backus was attempting to build hydroelectric dams on northern Minnesotan rivers,Chronology of the BWCA, Minnesota Humanities, , Retrieved July 20, 2010. and the blasting was likely connected to this development. It has been variously blamed on land speculators trying to convince buyers that the Brule had enough flow to be a viable source of hydroelectric power, or upon employees of a local development company working towards the same purpose. Brule Lake and much of the land around it gradually was brought under federal protection, and came to be incorporated into what is now the Boundary Waters Canoe Area.BWCA History, accessed May 21, 2012. In 1964, the United States government passed the Wilderness Act, designating the BWCA a wilderness area under special conservation rules. Lakes such as Brule where motorboats had previously been used were given temporary variances for continued motor use.US Forest Service. Forest Roadless Area Inventory and Evaluation. p. C-2 As a resort was located on Brule's shores, motorboats with a motor under 10 horsepower were permitted by law to continue to operate until 1994 or the resort closed. Since the resort closed, Brule Lake is open only to non- motorized craft.Title 36: Parks, Forests, and Public Property, 293.16 Special provisions governing the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, Superior National Forest, Minnesota.

Regime during the 16th to 18th centuries The Office of ‚ÄúCaballerizo mayor‚Äù was one of the main Offices of the Royal Household in charge of the Royal Stables and everything related to the transportation of the Monarch. When the King sorted out from the Royal Palace, the Caballerizo had the main position behind him and the major rang over the other Court Officials. He managed as well the stables, the carriages and the horses. He was assisted by the ‚ÄúPrimeros Caballerizos‚Äù (First Equerries) who were nominated by him. He was in charge of the Royal hunt as ‚ÄúMontero mayor‚Äù (Great Hunter) holding, in many cases, the ‚ÄúAlcaldias‚Äù (Majorships) of the Spanish royal sites.  Regime during the 19th and 20th centuries  During the reigns of the last two Kings before the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic, Alfonso XII and Alfonso XIII, the ‚ÄúCaballerizo‚Äù, which joined to his function that of the ‚ÄúMontero mayor‚Äù (Great Hunter) of the King (which was an Office created during the reign of Isabella II), was the second person in category after the Mayordomo mayor having the sole authority so soon the Monarch left the Royal Palace. Only a peer that had the rank of Grandee of Spain could be nominated for this Office. His annual wages were 15.000 pesetas, the same ones that had the ‚ÄúMayordomo‚Äù and, equally, he had the right to a private office at the Royal Palace of Madrid. Under his command they were the \\"Primer Caballerizo\\" (First Equerry) and the \\"Primer Montero\\" (First Hunter) with wages, both, of 7.500 pesetas per year. Under them they were situated the \\"Caballerizos de campo\\" (Equerries), who, usually, were officers of the Army. The ‚ÄúCaballerizo‚Äù accompanied the King in all his trips or, as it was called, \\"days\\" and sat close to him in every carriage, in car or in the trips by train or by ship throughout Spain or foreign countries. The ‚ÄúCaballerizo mayor‚Äù, with assistance of the First Caballerizo, was the chief of the Royal Mews. Also, he was the chief of the Armory of the Royal Palace of Madrid. As ‚ÄúMontero mayor‚Äù, with the help of the First Montero, he managed the hunting lodges of the Heritage of the Crown and organized the hunts attended by the King on the hunting-grounds of the Crown as the Royal forests of El Pardo, the Royal Hunting Lodge of la Encomienda de Mudela or the Royal forests of Valsa√≠n. In the hunts organized by others, and attended also by the King, the ‚ÄúMontero mayor‚Äù was always accompanying him in that condition. As ‚ÄúMontero mayor‚Äù equally, his uniform was of green very dark cloth with own embroideries in form of branches of oak. In the Public Chapels and official ceremonies he normally stood right behind the Mayordomo mayor. He was styled ‚ÄúExcelent√≠simo se√±or Caballerizo y Montero mayor de Su Majestad‚Äù. This Office was suppressed after the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931 and never re- created after the restoration of the Monarchy in 1975.

Ebell, Mark. \\"American Board of Family Practice\\". Michigan State University, 1999, 12(3), 225-235. Clinical documentation Clinical documentation is a record of the critical thinking and judgment of a health care professional, facilitating consistency and effective communication among clinicians.MARSH. (2006). Clinical Documentation - Putting the House in Order. Marsh‚Äôs Risk Consulting Practicing. Retrieved from https://www.usask.ca/nursing/docs/news/HC_Clinical_Documentation.pdf Documentation performed at the time of clinical point of care can be conducted using paper or electronic formats. This process aims to capture medical information pertaining to patient's healthcare needs. The patient's health record is a legal document that contains details regarding patient's care and progress.Documentation Guidelines for Registered Nurses. College and Association of Registered Nurses of Alberta. 2006. http://www.nurses.ab.ca/carnaadmin/uploads/documentation%20for%20registered%20nurses.pdf . The types of information captured during the clinical point of care documentation include the actions taken by clinical staff including physicians and nurses, and the patient's healthcare needs, goals, diagnosis and the type of care they have received from the healthcare providers.Documentation, Revised 2008. College of Nurses of Ontario. 2008. http://www.cno.org/Global/docs/prac/41001_documentation.pdf . Such documentations provide evidence regarding safe, effective and ethical care and insinuates accountability for healthcare institutions and professionals. Furthermore, accurate documents provide a rigorous foundation for conducting appropriate quality of care analysis that can facilitate better health outcomes for patients.Keenan, G.M, Yakel, E., Tschannen, D., & Mandeville, M. (2008). Patient Safety and Quality: An Evidence-Based Handbook for Nurses. [Electronic version]. Rockville, MD: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Thus, regardless of the format used to capture the clinical point of care information, these documents are imperative in providing safe healthcare. Also, it is important to note that electronic formats of clinical point of care documentation are not intended to replace existing clinical process but to enhance the current clinical point of care documentation process. = Traditional approach = One of the major responsibilities for nurses in healthcare settings is to forward information about the patient's needs and treatment to other healthcare professionals. Traditionally, this has been done verbally. However, today information technology has made its entrance into the healthcare system whereby verbal transfer of information is becoming obsolete. In the past few decades, nurses have witnessed a change toward a more independent practice with explicit knowledge of nursing care. The obligation to point of care documentation not only applies to the performed interventions, medical and nursing, but also impacts the decision making process; explaining why a specific action has been prompted by the nurse. The main benefit of point of care documentation is advancing structured communication between healthcare professionals to ensure the continuity of patient care. Without a structured care plan that is closely followed, care tends to become fragmented. =Electronic documentation= Point of care (POC) documentation is the ability for clinicians to document clinical information while interacting with and delivering care to patients. The increased adoption of electronic health records (EHR) in healthcare institutions and practices creates the need for electronic POC documentation through the use of various medical devices. POC documentation is meant to assist clinicians by minimizing time spent on documentation and maximizing time for patient care. The type of medical devices used is important in ensuring that documentation can be effectively integrated into the clinical workflow of a particular clinical environment. Devices Mobile technologies such as personal digital assistants (PDAs), laptop computers and tablets enable documentation at the point of care. The selection of a mobile computing platform is contingent upon the amount and complexity of data. To ensure successful implementation, it is important to examine the strengths and limitations of each device. Tablets are more functional for high volume and complex data entry, and are favoured for their screen size, and capacity to run more complex functions. PDAs are more functional for low volume and simple data entry and are preferred for their lightweight, portability and long battery life. Electronic medical record An electronic medical record (EMR) contains patient's current and past medical history. The types of information captured within this document include patient's medical history, medication allergies, immunization statuses, laboratory and diagnostic test images, vital signs and patient demographics.National Institutes of Health. (2006). Electronic Health Records Overview. National Institutes of Health. Retrieved from http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/publications/informatics/ehr.pdf This type of electronic documentation enables healthcare providers to use evidence-based decision support tools and share the document via the Internet. Moreover, there are two types of software included within EMR: practice management and EMR clinical software. Consequently, the EMR is able to capture both the administrative and clinical data.Butler, E.S. & Lathram, C.J. (2005). Electronic Medical Records: The Future is Now. Retrieved from http://www.aameda.org/MemberServices/Exec/Articles/fall05/Electronic_Medical_Records.pdf Computer physician order entries A computerized physician order entry allows medical practitioners to input medical instructions and treatment plans for the patients at the point of care. CPOE also enable healthcare practitioners to use decision support tools to detect medication prescription errors and override non-standard medication regimes that may cause fatalities. Furthermore, embedded algorithms may be chosen for people of certain age and weight to further support the clinical point of care interaction.Santell, J.P. (2004). Computer-related Errors: What Every Pharmacist Should Know. USP Center. Retrieved from Overall, such systems reduce errors due to illegible writing on paper and transcribing errors. Mobile EMRs mHealth Mobile devices and tablets provide accessibility to the Electronic Medical Record during the clinical point of care documentation process. Mobile technologies such as Android phones, iPhones, BlackBerrys, and tablets feature touchscreens to further support the ease of use for the physicians. Furthermore, mobile EMR applications support workflow portability needs due to which clinicians can document patient information at the patient's bedside. = Advantages =  Workflow  The use of POC documentation devices changes clinical practice by affecting workflow processes and communication. With the availability of POC documentation devices, for example, nurses can avoid having to go to their deskspace and wait for a desktop computer to become available. They are able to move from patient to patient, eliminating steps in work process altogether. Furthermore, redundant tasks are avoided as data is captured directly from the particular encounter without the need for transcription.  Safety  A delay between face-to-face patient care and clinical documentation can cause corruption of data, leading to errors in treatment. Giving clinicians the ability to document clinical information when and where care is being delivered allows for accuracy and timeliness, contributing to increased patient safety in a dynamic and highly interruptive environment. Point of care documentation can reduce errors in a variety of clinical tasks including diagnostics, medication prescribing and medication administration. Collaboration and communication Ineffective communication among patient care team members is a root cause of medical errors and other adverse events. Point of care documentation facilitates the continuity of high quality care and improves communication between nurses and other healthcare providers. Proper documentation at the point of care can optimize flow of information among various clinicians and enhances communication. Clinicians can avoid going to a workstation and can access patient information at the bedside. It will also enable the timeliness of documentation, which is important to prevent adverse events.  Nurse-patient time  Literature from various studies show that approximately 25-50% of a nurse's shift is spent on documentation. As most documentation is done in the traditional manner, that is using paper and pen, enabling a POC documentation device could potentially allow 25-50% more time at the bedside. Using speech recognition and information has been studied . as a way to support nurses in POC documentation with encouraging results: 5276 of 7277 test words were recognised correctly and information extraction achieved the F1 of 0.86 in the category for irrelevant text and the macro-averaged F1 of 0.70 over the remaining 35 nonempty categories of the nursing handover form with our 101 test documents. = Disadvantages =  Complexities  Numerous point of care documentation systems produce data redundancies, inconsistencies and irregularities of charting. Some electronic formats are repetitious and time- consuming. Moreover, some point of care documentation from one setting to another without a standardized pattern, and there are no guidelines for standards to documenting. Inaccessibility also causes time to be lost in searching for charts. These issues all lead to wasted time, increasing costs and uncomfortable charting. A study adopted both qualitative and quantitative methods have confirmed complexities in point of care documentation. The study has also categorized these complexities into three themes: disruption of documentation; incompleteness in charting; and inappropriate charting. As a result, these barriers limit nurses competence, motivation and confidence; ineffective nursing procedures; and inadequate nursing auditing, supervision and staff development.  Privacy and security  When examining the use of any type of technology in healthcare its important to remember that technology holds private personal health information. As such, security measures need to be in place to minimize the risk for breaches of privacy and patient confidentiality. Depending on the country you live in its important to ensure that legislation standards are met. According to Collier in 2012, privacy and confidentiality breaches are rising largely attributed to the lack of appropriate encryption technology. For successful implementation of any health technologies it is vital to ensure adequate security measures are used such as strong encryption technology. =Countries= Canada ;Ontario The adoption of electronic formats of clinical point of care documentation is particularly low in Ontario. Consequently, provincial leaders such as eHealth Ontario and Ontario MD provide financial and technical assistance in supporting electronic documentation of clinical point of care through EMR. Furthermore, currently more than six million Ontarians have EMR; however, by 2012 this number is expected to increase to 10 million citizens. Conclusively, continued efforts are being made to adopt charting of patient information in electronic format to improve the quality of clinical point of care services Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOHLTC).

Reece (1833-1879) and Mary Augsburger Ransomer (1837-1934). William Reece was a veteran of the American Civil War, during which he was a prisoner of war. Following his death, she and her siblings were raised in reduced circumstances in nearby Zanesville, Ohio. Her brother Lawson took up photography there and worked in the photographic studio of Muntz and Pack. Reece also worked there briefly and was listed as an \\"artist\\" or \\"artist-retoucher\\".Vasseur, pp. 16-18 Like many photographers during this period Reece began her artistic career as a painter, and she claimed she only began to photograph in earnest when a serious illness, thought to be spinal meningitis or tuberculosis, forced her to abandon painting in 1903. She said that she took up photography while recovering from the illness at the home of relatives in Southern Pines, North Carolina, at the insistence of the nurse who cared for her. However, in 1901-02 Reece was listed in the Dayton City Directory as having a \\"studio\\", and there are dozens of photographic portraits taken by her that appear to be from this period.Vasseur, p. 18 In December 1903 Reece returned from her North Carolina recuperation, and moved to Dayton, where she opened a large photographic studio (she called it \\"The Rembrandt,\\" hoping the artistic name would help attract clients who wanted studio portraits - her strategy worked well, for within the next year she recorded that she made more than 600 photographic silhouette portraits).Vasseur, p. 19 The Poinsettia Girl), by Jane Reece (1907) Within a few years Reece's photographic style evolved from simple portraiture to a more artistic vision. For inspiration she subscribed to Alfred Stieglitz's important magazines Camera Notes and Camera Work. In 1907 she produced one of her best-known images, a self-portrait known as The Poinsettia Girl. In this work, Reece may have been influenced by another woman photographer, Eva Watson-Sch√ºtze, whose photograph The Rose was published in Camera Work in 1905. By 1909 she felt the need of advanced training in photography, and she moved briefly to New York to study with Clarence H. White at Columbia University. She stayed there for slightly less than four months, and later she claimed that White found her work too advanced for her to remain his student. Both White's and Reece's records and notes from that period are unclear about her actual attendance at Columbia, although she did produce a portrait of White in his studio.Fulton, pp. 33-34 She is also known to have met Gertrude K√§sebier during this visit, although the extent of their connection is unclear. Reece returned to Dayton in October of that year and opened a new portrait studio. Within a short while she had numerous clients, and for the next several years she made many commercial portraits of Dayton's prominent families. The Soul in Bondage), by Jane Reece (1911) In 1911 Reece traveled to California, where she made a small series of photographs that both define her artistic style and her life at the time. The series, called The Soul in Bondage, interpreted the mythological story of Andromeda who was bound to rocks by the ocean and rescued by Perseus. Reece took the pictures on Catalina Island, and the model is thought to have been former Dayton resident Marie Peiza. Dominque Vasseur, former curator at the Dayton Art Institute, said this series \\"symbolizes a psychological and emotional struggle of great proportion which one must assume to be autobiographical.\\"Vasseur, p. 29 At the time, Reece was questioning her commitment to photography and to the career she had chosen; she was experiencing financial hardships, and her health was poor. She must have resolved whatever doubts she had before going to California, for after she returned to Dayton in 1912 she expanded her artistic repertoire to include both her portrait business, and artistic images. Among her more famous works from this period are The Veteran (1912) and Whence (1916). Jane Reece. Have Drowned My Glory in a Shallow Cup (Tina Modotti), 1919. In 1919 Reece returned to visit friends in Los Angeles, and while there she photographed Edward Weston, Tina Modotti and her common-law husband Roubaix de l'Abrie Richey. In keeping with her pictorial style, she posed both Modotti and Richey in costume and gave them \\"artistic\\" characters. A photograph of Richey posing as Christ was titled Son of Man, while one of Modotti was called Have Drowned My Glory in a Shallow Cup; this has become one of her best known images. The title comes from a line (from stanza 93) taken from Edward Fitzgerald's 1859 translation of Omar Khayyam's Rubaiyat, \\"Have drown'd my Glory in a shallow Cup/And sold my Reputation for a Song.\\"Lowe, Sarah Margaret. \\"Tina Modotti's Vision: Photographic Modernism in Mexico, 1923-1930.\\" PhD Dissertation, City University of New York, 1996, p. 48. Reece, who suffered from both mental and physical ailments throughout her life, became ill while in Los Angeles and remained there until late 1920. When she returned to Dayton, she entered into the most prolific and artistically significant period of her career. During most of the 1920s and early 1930s she achieved both national and international acclaim for her work, receiving international recognition and awards. One reason for her success was that she incorporated a variety of different styles in her work; she regularly experimented with different genres, models and subject matter. Photography historian Naomi Rosenblum said Reece \\"was a scavenger of styles, finding ideas both in portraiture and for salon work in Naturalists, Symbolist, and on occasion, Cubist art.\\" Susan Talbot-Stanaway, Director of the Zanesville (Ohio) Museum of Art, which holds about 70 of Reece's photographs, said Reece loved to create \\"carefully constructed little stories\\" in her images. Spaces (Harry Los√©e), by Jane Reece (1922) Some of her most striking photographs were created in 1922, when she overlaid negatives she took of dancer Harry Los√©e with stencils to create bold, geometric lighting patterns reminiscent of later work by Man Ray. Also during this time Reece experimented with AutochromesBrannick, pp. 1-4 and short films. Due to her increased fame in the 1920s, Reece was engaged to take portraits of many artists and celebrities of the time, including Count and Countess Ilya Tolstoy, Jan Kubelik, Margaret Woodrow Wilson, Herman Sachs, Robert Frost, Roland Hayes and Helen Keller. After a visit to Europe in 1923‚Äì24, she was in demand for many international exhibitions. During the three-year period from 1928 to 1930 her photographs were included in at least 65 salons and exhibitions, including major shows in New York, Chicago, Boston, Los Angeles, Paris, London, Prague, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Toronto, Edinburgh, Madrid and Antwerp.Vasseur, pp. 168-175 Sometime in the mid-1930s, Reece's eyesight began to fail, and, coupled with the decline in the popularity of pictorialism, she began to produce less and less. In 1944, at the age of 76, she finally said she was giving up photography altogether due to \\"my silent ears and my dimming vision\\". She continued to exhibit her works and was honored with one-person shows at the Carmel Art Institute and the Dayton Art Institute in 1947. By the 1950s, however, pictorialism had largely fallen out of favor in the photography world, and Reece, finding no further use for her archives, donated over 400 photographs to the Dayton Art Institute. She lived out her last years in increasing ill health, isolation and poverty. She died in Dayton eight days before her 93rd birthday. Her collection of more than 10,000 glass plate negatives was left to Wright State University. Since Reece's death, her work has been rediscovered, and she is now recognized for her strong artistic vision and her leadership in photography during a changing time in the medium's history. The Dayton Art Institute has held two retrospectives of her work since her death, one in 1986 and again in 1997.

Historical precedents and regime during the 17th and 18th centuries  This Office was created in 1526 when, during the Habsburg dynasty, the Royal Court was shaped after that one that existed in the Court of Burgundy. Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, but also King of Spain, imported the etiquette styled in the Court of his paternal grandmother Mary of Burgundy and appointed the first ‚ÄúCamarera mayor de Palacio‚Äù for his wife, the Empress. The principal responsibility of the ‚ÄúCamarera mayor de Palacio‚Äù was managing all that was related with the service to the Queen and she had authority over the different dignities and servants that composed her personnel. Her first obligation was the personal assistance to the Sovereign. She had to accompany her at all time, up to the point of sleeping in her chamber, when the King was not doing it. She was in charge of the clothes purveyors and directed the formal dressing of the Queen. In fact she had the high duty of delivering the Queen the water and the towel during morning toilette. All these functions gave the ‚ÄúCamarera mayor‚Äù a great intimacy with the Queen, as well as a big influence over her.  Regime during the 19th and 20th centuries  In the structure of the Royal Household, the Office ‚ÄúCamarera mayor de Palacio‚Äù had the same category as that of the Mayordomo mayor. Only a woman with the rank of Grandee of Spain could be nominated for this Office, and she was chosen between those of the class of ‚ÄúDama de la Reina‚Äù (Lady of the Bedchamber) of major seniority. She was in charge of everything relative to the etiquette and organization of the Household of the Queen helped by the ‚ÄúMayordomo mayor‚Äù (High Steward) to the Queen. Between her duties there were signalling the dates for audiences to the Queen and accompanying her in every ceremony. Under the ‚ÄúCamarera mayor de Palacio‚Äù they were the ‚ÄúDamas de la Reina‚Äù (Ladies of the Bedchamber) and the ‚ÄúDamas al servicio particular de la Reina‚Äù (Ladies-in- Waiting). She had assigned an annual salary of 6.000 pesetas and had a private own office in the Royal Palace of Madrid. She was styled ‚ÄúExcelent√≠sima se√±ora Camarera mayor de Palacio‚Äù. This post was suppressed after the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931 and never re-created after the restoration of Monarchy in 1975.

The Office of ‚ÄúMayordomo mayor‚Äù was suppressed after the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931 and never re-created after the restoration of the Monarchy in 1975, but it can be said that it is the historical precedent of the modern Head of the Royal Household of Spain.  Historical precedents  Being a historical precedent the Office of ‚ÄúMayordomo‚Äù of the Kingdom of Castile, the ‚ÄúMayordomo mayor‚Äù of the King of Spain was in charge of the entire organization of the Royal Palace and of its government, having civil and even criminal jurisdiction within its walls through the so-called ‚ÄúBureo‚Äù tribunal.  Regime during the 19th and 20th centuries  Diverse dispositions regulated in the 19th and 20th centuries his functions, but they must be outlined the Royal decrees of October 28 of 1847 and September 4 of 1885. During the reigns of the last three Kings before the Second Spanish Republic, Isabel II, Alfonso XII and Alfonso XIII, the ‚ÄúMayordomo mayor‚Äù coordinated the whole palatial organization being, from 1840, the highest Office of the Royal Court and such denominated ‚ÄúJefe Superior de Palacio‚Äù (High Chief of the Palace). Only a peer that had the rank of Grandee of Spain could be nominated for this Office. Also, traditionally, the ‚ÄúMayordomo mayor‚Äù was higher hierarchically than the ‚ÄúSumiller de Corps‚Äù. During the reign of Alfonso XII and part of the reign of Alfonso XIII (until 1907) this latter Office was suppressed. The ‚ÄúMayordomo mayor‚Äù was equally the holder of the privy seal, or ‚ÄúGuardasellos‚Äù as he was called. In that position he assured the signature of all sort of documents by the King and the link between him and the Government. He did not have jurisdiction as in former times but the Prosecution Law required his official permission for every police inspection within the walls of all the Royal palaces. In that which concerned to his role in the activities of official nature, the ‚ÄúMayordomo‚Äù intervened, between others: * In royal births and baptisms where the invitations were dispatched by him, occupying the immediate site behind the Monarch. * In Public Chapels where he delivered the prayer-book to the King and was placed, also, immediately behind. * In the Lavatory of Poor, during Easter, in which he helped the Monarch to serve the plates in the later lunch that was offered. * In the ceremony of the Coverage of the Grandees where he dispatched the invitations on behalf of the King and fixed the order. * In official banquets in which he occupied one of the head-boards of the table. * In official audiences in which he fixed the day and hour. * In public ceremonies, in which he was placed in the first position close to the Caballerizo mayor. Under the ‚ÄúMayordomo‚Äù they were the King of Arms, as charged with the heraldry, the processes of titles of nobility and the management of the dignities. The dean of this class in 1931 was Don Jose de R√∫jula and Ochotorena, Marquess of Ciadoncha. The Office of King of Arms was suppressed after the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931 and never re-created after the restoration of the Monarchy in 1975. He was, at the same time, the high chief of the Court honorary servants called ‚ÄúGentilhombres Grandes de Espa√±a con ejercicio y servidumbre‚Äù (Gentlemen of the bedchamber Grandees of Spain), of the ‚ÄúMayordomos de semana‚Äù (Weeckly stewards literally) and of those called ‚ÄúGentilhombres de camara con ejercicio‚Äù (Gentlemen of the bedchamber), both (but especially the first and second ones) with certain duties attached to the person of the King. Also the Physicians of Chamber were under his dependence with a salary of 10.000 pesetas per year each one, accompanying the King in trips, hunts etc. Traditionally the Physician of Chamber who assisted to royal births was awarded with the peerage as it was the case of the first Marquess of San Gregorio and the first Count of San Diego. In 1931 the Physicians of the Chamber were Don Jacobo Lopez Elizagaray and Don Fernando Enr√≠quez of Salamanca. Also, this Office of Physician was suppressed after the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931 and never re-created after the restoration of the Monarchy in 1975. The Private Secretary to the King was also under the ‚ÄúMayordomo‚Äù. He was in charge of the ordinary matters of the Monarch and was his more faithful assistant. During almost the whole reign of Alfonso XIII, and in the moment of his exile, this Office was held by Don Emilio de Torres y Gonzalez-Arn√°u, first Marquess of Torres de Mendoza. The last office under the ‚ÄúMayordomo‚Äù was the General Inspector of the Royal Palaces, the former \\"Aposentador\\" (Office that the painter Diego Vel√°zquez had occupied in the 17th century), with an annual wage of 12.500 pesetas and who was the real steward and butler to the King. At the fall of the monarchy this Office was occupied by Don Luis de As√∫a y Campos. He had his own office in all the Royal residences and was the chief of the watchmen, the doormen, the footmen and the personnel of the so-called \\"Ramillete\\" that were the servants and footmen who served at the royal table and the craftsmen of the different workshops (watchmakers, cabinet-makers, cookers, janitors ..). All of these Offices were equally suppressed and they don,t exist today. In the reign of Alfonso XIII the wages of the ‚ÄúMayordomo‚Äù were 15.000 pesetas per year and had his own office and quarter at the Royal Palace of Madrid. Likewise, he was always awarded with the highest distinctions of the Kingdom, the neck chain of the Order of the Golden Fleece and the grand cross of the Order of Charles III. The uniform of the ‚ÄúMayordomo‚Äù was ‚Äúcasac√≥n‚Äù (frock coat) with embroidery in all the seams. He was styled ‚ÄúExcelent√≠simo se√±or Mayordomo mayor de Su Majestad‚Äù as well as ‚ÄúSumiller de Corps‚Äù and ‚ÄúGuardasellos‚Äù (when he hold the privy seal).

He has been the chief executive officer (CEO) of UBS Group AG since November 2011. Ermotti is slated to succeed Walter Kielholz as the incoming chairman of Swiss Re, Switzerland's largest reinsurance company, in 2021. He previously served as the deputy chief executive for Italian bank UniCredit, from 2007 to 2010. Leading UBS, Ermotti denounced the 2011 rogue trader scandal, implementing strict corporate policies governing community standards and initiated a major restructuring of the bank around private banking and limited its sell side operations. Leading the firm for nearly a decade, he is the longest serving head of UBS. In February 2020 UBS announced that Ralph Hamers, CEO of ING Group, would be succeeding Sergio Ermotti as CEO on 1 November. It has been speculated that he might transition into Swiss politics after his career in banking. He ruled out entering select political races for the Bundesrat stating that he was \\"not a politician\\". In addition to English, Ermotti speaks Italian, German, and French fluently.  Early life and education  Sergio Pietro Ermotti was born on 11 May 1960 in Lugano, Switzerland, an Italian-speaking city. He left school at age 15 to pursue aspirations of being a footballer and skier. Before turning 18 and enrolling in college to fulfill theses aspirations, Ermotti decided to fill his time with an apprenticeship at the Corn√®r Bank in Lugano to \\"get up to speed with accounting, finance, and so on\\". At his apprenticeship, he learned to sell and trade stocks. Although Ermotti did not attend university, he received a Swiss federal banking expert diploma and subsequently attended the Advanced Management Program at Oxford University. Banking career After his apprenticeship as a stockbroker at the Corn√®r Bank, Ermotti was later promoted to trading. In 1985, Ermotti moved to Citibank in Zurich where he traded equity-linked products and later served as its Resident Vice President. In 1987, he went on to the Swiss office of the US investment bank Merrill Lynch in Zurich, and stayed with the bank for 16 years. He started with holding various positions in equity derivatives and capital markets, and contributed to the expansion of the capital market business of the bank in french-speaking parts of Switzerland. In 1993, he was promoted to the position of Managing Director and moved to London being in charge for the European equity derivatives unit. Three years later, in 1996, Ermotti relocated to New York, as a head of global derivatives trading. He was eventually promoted to co-head of global equity markets and a member of the executive management committee for global markets & investment banking at Merrill Lynch, where he worked from 2001 to 2003. He joined the Italian bank UniCredit headquartered in Milan, in December 2005 as head of markets & investment banking. At that point in time, UniCredit took over German bank, HypoVereinsbank (HVB). From 2007, he was UniCredit's deputy chief executive officer with responsibility for the strategic business area, corporate and investment banking and private banking, before leaving in 2010. Ermotti was appointed chairman and chief executive of UBS's Europe, Middle East, and Africa group, and became a member of the group executive board in April 2011. He was appointed interim group CEO in September 2011, and permanently in November 2011. In response to the 2011 UBS rogue trader scandal, Ermotti sent an internal memo stating: \\"I want to make clear that no one's personal interest nor any amount of revenue is worth more than the bank's reputation\\". Because of his new responsibility as CEO, he resigned from his position as a president of Darwin Airline in 2011. Ermotti was a member of the board at the London Stock Exchange between September 2008 and July 2013. In 2012, he tapped a colleague from Merrill Lynch, Andrea Orcel, to lead UBS's investment banking arm, eventually assisting him in navigating the 2013 Libor trading scandal, a major corporate restructuring, and a major expansion of mergers and acquisitions (M&A;) activity. In November 2014, he became the CEO for UBS Group AG permanently. In 2015, the Swiss newspaper Schweiz am Sonntag named him as the most successful manager of a company listed on the Swiss Market Index. His salary in fiscal year 2017 was estimated to be US$14.9 million. In February 2020 UBS announced that Ralph Hamers CEO of ING Group would be succeeding Sergio Ermotti as CEO on 1 November. Swiss Re, Switzerland's largest reinsurance company, announced its intention to onboard Ermotti as its next chairman in 2021 succeeding Walter Kielholz. Personal life As of April 2014, Ermotti was married with two children. His favorite movies are George Roy Hill's The Sting and Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Ermotti speaks fluent Swiss Italian, Swiss German, Swiss French, and English. He supports Italian football club, A.C. Milan. Ermotti was challenged by Marc Walder, CEO of Swiss media company Ringier and Gianluigi Bianchi, managing partner for Europe of Wealth-X to undertake the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge.

Development Thomas Towle was an engineer that had been involved with many early aircraft designs. Having just co-designed the Eastman E-2 Sea Rover and the Towle WC. Towle found funding to create a new entity, the Towle Aircraft Company to produce the TA-2. Design The TA-2 featured an corrugated aluminum hull. The wings were all metal with internal stiffeners, rather than ribs, based loosely on the Ford Trimotor, which Towle worked on previously. The twin Wright R-540 engines sat on small pylons on top of the shoulder mounted wing. Two floats were mounted directly below the engine pylons which incorporated the hydraulically actuated landing gear. The prototype was originally designed for 165 hp Wright 540 engines. Operational history The TA-2 was tested in Lake St. Clair on 7 November 1929 by test pilot George Pond and James Bradley. It broke up on takeoff and sank to the bottom of the lake. The aircraft appears to have been rebuilt as a Towle TA-2 was reported to have visited Lympne Airport, Kent, United Kingdom in February 1930. The wing from the prototype was salvaged and used on the next iteration, the Towle TA-3.

The TA-3 was a six-seat follow-on to the Towle TA-2 which crashed on its first flight. The wing from the TA-2 prototype was salvaged and reused on the TA-3. Design The TA-3 featured two diesel radial engines on tall struts above the wings. Diesel engines were relatively new and were touted as being safer because they used a less volatile fuel than gasoline. The engines were provided on loan from the Packard Motor Car Company. The salvaged all-metal wing featured internal bracing based on the Ford Trimotor design that Towle had worked on previously. The tail used two rudders placed in the slipstream of the engines. Operational history The prototype was built at Grosse Ile Municipal Airport and first flew in May 1930 piloted by George Pond. The prototype was leased to Kohler Airlines for two years before being flipped in a gear-down water landing in 1932. The aircraft was later sold and used in running liquor from the Bahamas to Florida during prohibition until it was destroyed in a storm at Bimini Island.

The NFPF publishes these DVD sets, with accompanying booklets and extensive commentary, to promote public access to the films preserved by the American archival community. The NFPF's inaugural DVD set ‚Äî Treasures from American Film Archives, issued in 2000 ‚Äî was the first video anthology sampling the range of films preserved by American cultural institutions.

Since 2000, the NFPF has issued five other box sets, each with a specific theme. More Treasures from American Archives, 1894‚Äì1931 showcases the creative range of American motion pictures in their first four decades through examples preserved by the nation's leading silent-film archives. It was the first NFPF set to feature audio commentary.

In 1868 he studied the collections in the Museo del Prado (Prado Museum) in Madrid, especially those of Goya and Vel√°zquez. In 1867 he travelled to Jerez de la Frontera to work as a restorer and designer of stained glass. In 1871 he moved to Rome, where he remained for four years, getting to know Mariano Fortuny, who greatly influenced his paintings. = Travel = In 1881 he moved to Par√≠s, where he studied for nine years, painting works set in the eighteenth century in the style of Fortuny with notable success.

He was the first governor of the Entre R√≠os Province and fought in the battle of Vuelta de Obligado. Early life Lucio Mansilla was born in Buenos Aires on April 2, 1789, son of Andr√©s Xim√©nez de Mansilla and Eduarda Mar√≠a Bravo. Lucio Mansilla was the 7th generation of the Mansilla family living in the Americas.Launay, p. 26 He began his military career in 1806, during the British invasions of the R√≠o de la Plata, under the command of Santiago de Liniers. He was part of the Gallegos regiment. He also fought in the 180 invasions, in the combat of Miserere on June 2, and the actions of July 5 and 6. The Buenos Aires Cabildo allowed him to run a math school in 1809.Launay, pp. 26‚Äì27 He had five children with Polana: Lucio Victorio Mansilla, Eduarda, Lucio Norberto, Agustina and Carlos. War of independence Mansilla joined the forces of Jos√© Gervasio Artigas in 1812, against the Portuguese armies summoned by the royalist Javier de El√≠o. When Artigas left the siege before the Second Banda Oriental campaign, he joined Jos√© Rondeau. He was shot on May 12, 1813, during the attack to the fortress \\"El Quilombo\\", and joined back the siege when his injury healed. He was rewarded by Buenos Aires for his military actions.Launay, pp. 27‚Äì28 He joined the Army of the Andes in 1814, and fought in the battles of Chacabuco and Talcahuano, under the command of Jos√© de San Mart√≠n. He also fought the decisive battle of Maip√∫ under the command of Juan Gregorio de Las Heras. He was rewarded by both Argentina and Chile for his actions, and returned to Buenos Aires.Launay, pp. 28‚Äì30 Entre R√≠os Francisco Ram√≠rez called Mansilla to mediate between him and Artigas. When Artigas invaded Entre R√≠os, he joined forces with Ram√≠rez against him. He had an important role at the battle of Las Tunas. The conflict between Ram√≠rez and Artigas led to the exile of Artigas in Paraguay. Ram√≠rez declared the independence of the Republic of Entre R√≠os and incorporated Corrientes and Misiones to it. Mansilla opposed these actions, and denied the help of his army. Ram√≠rez died in an ambush, and the Republic of Entre R√≠os was abolished and reincorporated into Argentina. Mansilla was appointed governor, as he was the commander of the only military unit in the area. He ended the hostilities between Entre R√≠os and the Santa Fe Province. He ruled for three years and signed the Quadrilateral Treaty.Launay, pp. 34‚Äì36 War with Brazil Mansilla became a general in 1826, and marched to the Argentine-Brazilian War under the command of Carlos Mar√≠a de Alvear, operating at Rio Grande Do Sul. He led the siege of Montevideo, and played an important role in the battle of Camacu√°. He defeated the Brazilian cavalry at the battle of Omb√∫, and fought in the battle of Ituzaing√≥.Launay, pp. 36‚Äì37 Civil War Mansilla refused to join the coup of Juan Lavalle against the governor Manuel Dorrego in 1828. Lavalle was ousted from power some time later, and Juan Jos√© Viamonte appointed him head of the police of Buenos Aires, once the Federals returned to power. He joined the military again with the War of the Confederation, and moved to Tucum√°n. He did not take action during the campaign of Lavalle against Juan Manuel de Rosas during the French blockade of the R√≠o de la Plata, because Rosas was his brother-in-law (Mansilla married the sister of Rosas, Marina Agustina Dominga del Coraz√≥n de Jes√∫s Ortiz de Rozas y L√≥pez de Osornio on April 2, 1831) and Lavalle his comrade in arms during the War of Brazil.Launay, pp. 37‚Äì38 Anglo-French blockade of the R√≠o de la Plata Britain and France began a war against Argentina, on behalf of the Colorados of Uruguay, as Argentina supported in Blancos in the Uruguayan Civil War. An Anglo-French navy sought to navigate the Paran√° River, and Mansilla was appointed to the defense. He prepared the defense at Vuelta de Obligado, closing the river with chains, and prepared several artilleries, defended by 2000 men. However, the artillery had a lower range, precision and reload speed than the cannons of the ships. The battle of Vuelta de Obligado harmed a number of ships, but the navy prevailed after a couple of hours. Mansilla led a charge against French soldiers that tried to land and dismantle the artillery, being hurt in the chest and leaving Juan Bautista Thorne in command. The Argentine cavalry forced the French to return to their ships, but a second attack by both French and British had better success. The battle ended with 250 deaths and 400 injured for Argentina, and 26 deaths and 86 injured for the Anglo-French navy.Launay, pp. 43‚Äì46 Mansilla prepared a new resistance at Quebracho, when the navy attempted to return to Montevideo. This attack gave serious damage to the ships.Launay, p. 58 Mansilla died in Buenos Aires on April 10, 1871, during an epidemic of Yellow Fever in the city.Launay, p. 63 References Bibliography * Category:1871 deaths Category:Argentine generals Category:Governors of Entre R√≠os Province Category:Federales (Argentina) Category:1792 births Category:Burials at La Recoleta Cemetery ","title":"Lucio Norberto Mansilla"},{"id":"33659019","text":"Milagros Leal (December 2, 1902 ‚Äì March 2, 1975) was a Spanish actress.

The hay pellets are made from dried field hay (grass) that is harvested at the end of season and then pressed into pellets.Goodwin, S. (2008, Sept 2). Farmer says he‚Äôs found a way to create heat from hay. The Advocate. Retrieved from http://www.pictouadvocate.com/2008/09/02/farmer-says-he%E2%80%99s-found-a-way- to-create-heat-from-hay/ Swanson developed a furnace with a local Pictou furnace maker, a Cape Breton company that makes pellet machines, and scientists at the Nova Scotia Agricultural College. While developing the furnace Swanson and his team had problems related to the building up of glass that was produced when the hay was burning in the furnace. This is because hay contains sand and potassium chloride, sometimes referred to as clinkers, and its ashes are heavy. Therefore, when the hay is burning in the furnace the sand turns into glass that can be up to an inch thick and this was causing problems because the glass would build up enough that it was putting the fire out(which was the energy created by the burning of the hay). Thus, Swanson and his team had to find a way to break the newly formed glass back into sand. It took 10 different prototype burning pots before one was created that had an ash breaker that would work. The temperature in the water chamber of the furnace can reach the boiling point within seven minutes and at that rate the furnace can burn off the majority of the ash and leave little waste. Once development was complete on the furnace the final working prototype of the Waterside Hay Hot Water Pellet Furnace was 45 inches tall and around a foot in diameter. It can burn 50 ‚Äì 125 pounds of pellets a day and releases 30,000 ‚Äì 190,000 BTU's (British thermal units) an hour. It is estimated that it will take 8,100 square metres of grass to heat an average Canadian home per year. =Key partners in development= Swanson and his company have received grants to help assist in the patent and safety certificate testing from Agri-Futures Nova Scotia, which is the provincial distributor of funds through Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada‚Äôs Advancing Canadian Agriculture and Agri-Food (ACAAF) Program. LST Energy Inc. received a $100,000 prize offered by Innovacorporation for winning first place in a regional technology start-up competition in 2010. The Nova Scotia Agricultural College has been helping LST energy Inc. on the development of the hay pellet furnace. In 2009, when LST Energy advanced to the final round of the regional technology start-up competition they had one of their completed prototypes installed and up and running at the Agricultural College. A Musquodoboit, Nova Scotia company has been recruited to produce the hay pellets suitable for use in the furnace. Benefits Hay, which comes from grass, is an economically viable, renewable and sustainable resource. Two acres of hay will heat an average home for the winter and it would only take 4% of Canadian land to produce enough hay to heat every Canadian home. The hay pellets used in the furnace are also an environmental friendly energy source. It is considered a carbon neutral energy source. The hay pellets burning efficiency is increased by its low moisture content and it burns without producing any smoke and as clean or cleaner than any fossil fuel. Wood stoves release 45g of particulate/hour, while hay pellets only product 1.2g/hour. Research has been conducted to discover what type of grass is best suited for use in the Waterside Hot Water Hay Pellet Furnace and it was found the reed canary hay pellets, produced from reed canary grass is the most efficient grass pellet source. It emitted 90% less Carbon Dioxide (CO2) than heating oil, propane or natural gas. Eighteen thousand tonnes of CO2 can be saved from being emitted into the atmosphere for every 50 acres of reed canary grass burnt as hay pellets in the Waterside Hot Water Hay Pellet Furnace. It‚Äôs a potential new source of income for the struggling agricultural industry. This new furnace also has the potential to strengthen the agricultural community in Canada because farmers may soon be able to sell their hay for pellet production. Farmers currently make $30/ton of hay, however it is predicted that if demand for hay increases because it is needed for pellet production that the farmers could potentially make up to $100/ton, with the consumer being charge $200/ton of pellets. Presently, one tonne of hay is equivalent to around $700 worth of heating oil. It is predicted that a farm in Nova Scotia with 100 acres of hay could make up to $50,000 a year selling their hay for production of pellets that will be used in the furnace. An increase in demand for pellets made out of hay could also potentially increase jobs available in rural farming areas across Canada. Heating a home with hay pellets is a much cheaper alternative to that of oil. Swanson currently heats a three-bedroom apartment, a two-bedroom apartment, and a two-bedroom house using hay pellets and it cost him only $300/month, compared to the $900/month it used to cost him when he was heating these properties with oil.

Life Wilhelm Busch was born in Elberfeld on 27 March 1897, a son of pastor Dr. Wilhelm Busch. His mother, Johanna Busch, (n√©e Kullen), came from the House of Kullen, H√ºlben (near Urach) which was rooted in Swabian Pietism. Although Wilhelm Busch came from a famous family of pastors, in his early years he was anything but religious. He spent his early life in Frankfurt where he pursued and finished his secondary school studies. After graduating he served with the German army as a young officer-lieutenant in World War I, where on the battlefield at Verdun he came to a personal faith in Christ when a comrade was hit by a grenade. When the war was over he decided to study protestant theology in T√ºbingen. After completing his studies he served six months as a vicar in the Lutheran Church at Gellershagen near Bielefeld where he met his future wife Emilie (\\"Emmi\\") M√ºller. In 1924 he became a pastor in Essen, where he started with an evangelistic Christian ministry especially to local miners. In 1929 he became a youth pastor in the Christian youth centre in Essen, later called Weigle-Haus (member of the western German CVJM/YMCA), established by his predecessor, Pastor Wilhelm Weigle. At the same time he was preaching evangelising sermons all over the country and abroad. The present-day Weigle-Haus in Essen. Pastor Busch took over the leadership of the House in 1929. On 11 February 1934 the Protestant youth club (Evangelische Jugendverein) was dissolved and the youth house closed. Busch resisted pressure to merge with the Hitlerjugend (Hitler Youth) and soon managed to reopen the house. The youth work continued under the name \\"City Mission\\" and the house itself received its present name, the \\"Weigle- Haus\\". During World War II the house was partially destroyed and reconstruction took place until it was reopened again on 23 May 1954. Wilhelm Busch still led the work until his official retirement in 1962. The program for youth revolved mainly around the jointly spent Sundays with Church services, sports and games and even educational opportunities such as the so- called intelligence-club (Intelligenz-Club). During the time of national socialism he adopted the uncompromising position of the German Confessing Church against the influence of the Third Reich on the life of the Church. As an active member of this opposition to government-sponsored efforts to nazify the German Protestant church, he proclaimed his faith openly and ignored orders to refrain from teaching the Bible‚Äîwhich earned him several arrests and lengthy jail confinements. Even under the Nazis, Pastor Busch managed to attract attendances of two to three hundred boys at his scripture lessons. He was holding Bible study meetings in private houses, in basements, and in the open air. His son never attended the meetings of the Hitler Youth though this was required by law. On one occasion in 1937 he was arrested right after evangelising in the church of St. Paul in Darmstadt due to Nazi authorities feeling upset over the capability of the Christian movement to attract the attention of the general public with Biblical messages and counter their own aspirations to control the masses. During the sermon, state officials tried to avoid a public uproar in the crowded Church and let him preach. After being captured, an SS commissioner presented him official orders expelling him from the territory of Hessen. As he refused to accept due to his commitment to perform Biblical work among people as a pastor, he was immediately taken into custody. > During my life, I have passed through periods of various hard trials. > Because of my faith I have been thrown into prisons on more than one > occasion. Not because I had been stealing silver spoons or had committed > some other crime. In the Third Reich, Nazis didn't like youth pastors like > me, and that's why authorities kept throwing me into these pretty sinister > places. After World War II he renewed his activities as a youth pastor and itinerant evangelist with the slogan \\"Jesus our destiny\\" becoming the central topic of his ministry even after his official retirement in 1962. He was a Christian pacifist. Busch's pupils in the post-war era included Ulrich Parzany who said he was strongly affected by Busch's \\"clear, illustrative and bold proclamation of the gospel\\". He died in hospital in L√ºbeck on 20 June 1966 while on the trip home after evangelising in Sassnitz on R√ºgen. The theme of his last sermon a day before was \\"Is life with God worth it?\\" (\\"Was hat man denn von einem Leben mit Gott?\\"). He was buried four days after his death. The funeral was attended by a number of people including the later President of the Federal Republic of Germany Gustav Heinemann who gave in his oration the following testimony about the late fellow: > Wherever he emerged, there was always something going on. The essential > about him however was that as an ambassador of his Lord he was credible and > penetrated all reservations. (Wo er zugegen war, passierte immer etwas. Das > Eigentliche an ihm aber war dieses, dass er ein glaubhafter und aller > Vorbehalte durchsto√üender Bote seines Herrn war.) Literary works *Jesus Our Destiny (in German Jesus unser Schicksal) is the most well known of his works. It is based on a compilation of his radio speeches. A common theme in his speeches is the centrality of Jesus to Christian doctrine. Published after his death, this book has been translated into all major world languages and attained a worldwide distribution of several million copies. The title \\"Jesus Our Destiny\\" comes from the main topic of big Evangelization that pastor Busch held in Essen in 1938.

He saw service during the War of the Austrian Succession and was killed at the Battle of Cartagena de Indias. Early naval service Lord Aubrey was born circa 1710, the eighth son of Charles Beauclerk, 1st Duke of St Albans by his wife Diana. After some previous service he was made post-captain on 1 April 1731, and appointed to , which ship he commanded on the Leeward Islands station for about eighteen months. Through the years 1734-5 he commanded HMS Garland in the Mediterranean, and in 1737-9 on the same station. He returned home in January 1740, and was almost immediately appointed to the 60-gun , from which, in the course of the summer, he was transferred to the 70-gun HMS Prince Frederick, one of the fleet which sailed for the West Indies with Sir Chaloner Ogle on 26 October 1740. War of the Austrian Succession On the afternoon of one of the first days in January 1741, as the fleet was off the west end of Hispaniola, four large ships were sighted. The admiral signalled the Prince Frederick and five other ships of the line to chase. Towards dusk the strangers hoisted French colours, but did not shorten sail, and they were not overtaken till nearly ten o'clock. The Prince Frederick was the headmost ship, and Lord Aubrey hailed the ship he came up with, desiring her to heave to. As she neither did so nor answered his hail, he fired a shot across her bows; she replied with a broadside, and as the other ships came up a smart interchange of firing took place, after which they lay by till daylight. Their nationality was then apparent; they were really French ships, and the two squadrons parted with mutual apologies. The affair passed as a mistake, and probably was so on the part of the English. The fleet, under Sir Chaloner Ogle, arrived at Jamaica on 7 January and joined Vice-Admiral Edward Vernon, under whose command it proceeded to Cartagena on the Spanish main. There, in the attack on the Boca Chica during the Battle of Cartagena de Indias, Lord Aubrey was slain on 22 March 1741.

In 2010, the Nashville Public Library was the recipient of the National Medal for Museum and Library Service. The library was named the Gale/Library Journal 2017 Library of the Year. History A succession of public libraries, known by a variety of names, served the people of Nashville. The early libraries were generally small, offered a narrow range of services, and operated on a fee schedule. In 1897, the Tennessee General Assembly authorized cities of a certain size to establish and maintain free public libraries and reading rooms. With this authority, in 1901 the Howard Library became Nashville‚Äôs first free circulating library. Also in 1901, Andrew Carnegie offered to donate $100,000 for a new library building if the city would take care of its maintenance. The city accepted those terms, and in 1904, the Carnegie Library Building was completed on Polk Avenue. Andrew Carnegie enabled the building and opening of an additional three branches between 1912 and 1919. Two of those buildings are still in use today, the North Branch and the East Branch. The Carnegie Library Building was razed and replaced with the Ben West Public Library in 1963. The Main Library was housed in the Ben West building for 38 years. The new Main Library Building, designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects, was opened in 2001. Previously on the site for the Main Library was a downtown shopping mall called Church Street Center. Branches There are 20 library branches in the Nashville Public Library system. They are: * Bellevue Branch Library * Bordeaux Branch Library * Donelson Branch Library * East Branch Library * Edgehill Branch Library * Edmondson Pike Branch Library * Goodlettsville Branch Library * Green Hills Branch Library * Hadley Park Branch Library * Hermitage Branch Library * Inglewood Branch Library * Looby Branch Library * Madison Branch Library * North Branch Library * Old Hickory Branch Library * Pruitt Branch Library * Richland Park Branch Library * Southeast Branch Library * Thompson Lane Branch Library * Watkins Park Branch Library Programs and Services The Nashville Public Library features a variety of public programming. The library offers puppet shows in the Main Library as well as throughout the Nashville community. The library offers digital collections, e-book and audiobook downloads, language learning services, and computer classes. There are a variety of book clubs hosted throughout the library system. In 2010, the Nashville Public Library began partnering with Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools to offer the students access to the public library materials. Called \\"Limitless Libraries,\\" this program offers access to approximately 1.5 million information resources. The Main Library's Special Collections Division contains several archival and oral history collections highlighting Nashville history. Among them, the Civil Rights Room, documenting the Civil Rights Movement in Nashville, and an oral history collection documenting the 2010 Tennessee floods in Nashville. Portraits The library includes many portraits of Tennesseans, including former mayor and Confederate veteran Randal William McGavock.  Friends of the Library and Library Foundation  Friends of the Nashville Public Library is a non-profit that offers memberships and supports the library through book sales. The Friends of the Nashville Public Library offer support for the summer reading program as well other programs and collection development. The Nashville Public Library Foundation is a non-profit founded in 1997 to raise funds for the Nashville Public Library. Depending on private donors, the Nashville Public Library Foundation offers funds for various programs, services, and building improvements in the library system. These include funding of the Bringing Books to Life pre-school literacy program, the Special Collections' Civil Rights Room, and $5 million in collection development funds. On December 2, 2015, The Nashville Public Library unveiled the new Kidman-Urban Puppet Stage in the children's section of the library, made possible by a donation from Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban, long time supporters of the library.

He is the chairman of the board of directors of Grupo IAMSA, one of the main passenger transportation consortiums in Mexico. He also has a 9.3% stake in the media conglomerate Grupo Prisa.  Biography  Roberto Alc√°ntara is the son of the politician and businessman Jesus Alc√°ntara Miranda, who was mayor of Acambay, located in the State of Mexico and twice a federal congressman and senator. His grandfather, Manuel Alc√°ntara, also served as senator and mayor in 1927 and, according to the chronicler Edgar Serrano, he brought electric light to the village. Roberto Alc√°ntara was an entrepreneur even during his childhood. With only 10 years old, he sold corn, lemonade and candies in the town market; in addition he used to sell women's stockings house by house. Alc√°ntara studied high school at the Franco Spanish School in Mexico City. Subsequently, his father commissioned him the business of a nixtamal mill. He was successful and soon opened several tortillerias and even established a corn transport company. Nonetheless, at the age of 29, he joined the bus company founded by his father: Grupo Toluca. In 1990, Grupo Toluca partnered with Grupo Flecha Amarilla, a transportation company started by the Herrera family and renowned Mexican entrepreneurs. Thanks to this union between the two main interstate bus operators in Mexico, the largest transport consortium in the country was created: Grupo IAMSA. Alc√°ntara initially acted as an advisor in the company and together with his team he began diversifying the business by entering into the luxury land transportation sector with the ETN bus line. In August 1991, when the privatization of the Mexican bank system was announced, the Alc√°ntara family bought Bancrecer, a financial institution. Bancrecer merged with BANORO, Somoza and Cortina Casa de Bolsa in order to integrate the Bancrecer Financial Group. Roberto Alc√°ntara was named president of the board of directors of this institution, a position he held during nine years. The bank did not survive the financial crisis of 1994‚Äì1995 and the stock control was acquired by the Instituto para la Protecci√≥n al Ahorro Bancario (IPAB), formerly known as the Fondo Bancario de Protecci√≥n al Ahorro (Fobaproa). After reaching an agreement with the authorities, Bancrecer was finally given to the Mexican government in 1999. Transportation sector leader Due to his experience in the sector, Roberto Alc√°ntara presided the C√°mara Nacional de Autotransporte de Pasaje y Turismo during 1992‚Äì1994 and 2002‚Äì2004. Moreover, and after his father's death, Alc√°ntara would hold the presidency of Grupo IAMSA in 2005. Under his leadership, the consortium grew by adding dozens of small businesses and thus became the largest firm in the sector with more than 900 members. Currently, Grupo IAMSA is Mexico's only multimodal transport conglomerate (buses, railroad and airplanes), integrated in the terrestrial sector by four entities: Flecha Amarilla, Grupo Toluca, IAMSA and Omnibus de M√©xico. It has over 80 years of experience, operates in 24 states of the Mexican Republic and serves the major cities in the State of Texas and other cities on the East Coast of the United States. According to experts, it covers about 24% of the Mexican bus travelling market. Moreover, it has more than 10 thousand units, representing about 25% of the total buses of the federal passenger transportation industry. Grupo IAMSA generates more than 24 thousand jobs and offers its services to more than 300 million passengers per year. Among its most recognized brands are ETN, Omnibus, TAP, Amealcenses and Flecha Amarilla. In 2006, Grupo IAMSA, in partnership with Grupo Irelandia (owner group of the airline Ryanair), founded the low-cost Mexican airline Viva Aerobus. Viva Aerobus began operating in November 2006 with two routes between Monterrey and Tijuana. Nowadays, Viva Aerobus offers more than 60 routes and in 2013 the airline announced the renewal of its fleet by purchasing 52 Airbus A320 aircraft, becoming the airline with the youngest fleet in Mexico. In addition, within the framework of the airline's tenth anniversary, Grupo IAMSA acquired a 100% stake in Viva Aerobus; it is now a fully Mexican company. Following the success of Viva Aerobus, Grupo IAMSA and Irelandia launched the airline Viva Colombia in 2012. However, in December 2016, an agreement among the shareholders was established; it Irelandia to buy IAMSA's stake in the airline. Roberto Alc√°ntara¬¥s businesses have diversified into several sectors. Since 2008, his company Omnitren, together with the Spanish company Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles (CAF), began operating Mexico City¬¥s suburban train. In 2014, his company Telepeaje Din√°mico won the public auction to operate the electronic toll system (IAVE). Although politicians like Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador and some PAN and PRD congressmen pointed out the existence of irregularities in this process, no official allegation was presented. Also in that year, Alc√°ntara was appointed as an independent advisor of the media conglomerate Grupo PRISA and member of its Delegate Committee. Grupo PRISA currently operates in 22 countries and owns the newspaper El Pa√≠s, the publishers Santillana and Alfaguara, and in Mexico holds several radio stations together with Televisa and Radiorama like W Radio, Los 40 Principales and Ke Buena. A couple of months later, Alc√°ntara invested 100 million euros in PRISA through the consortium Transporter. After that, he increased his shareholding to 9.3%, becoming the main individual shareholder of the group.

By World War II, radar had become the chief medium of air-to-ground and air-to-air communication. Since then, transponders have enabled pilots and controllers to identify planes automatically, greatly improving air security. Most recently, in addition to sophisticated radio and GPS systems, the unmanned aerial vehicle, or drone, has revolutionised aerial surveillance and combat. Early systems The early days of flight proved quite difficult for air-to-ground communication. Ground crews would rely on colored paddles, hand signs and other visual aids. This was effective for ground crews, but it offered no way for pilots to communicate back. In the beginning of World War I planes were not outfitted with radios, so soldiers used large panel cut outs to distinguish friendly forces. These cut outs could also be used as a directional device to help pilots navigate back to friendly airfields. As technology developed, planes were able to use telegraph systems to send messages in Morse code. Telegraphs used a plunger to complete an electric circuit. When the circuit was completed it sent out a signal as a dot or a dash. By depressing the plunger devise in a rhythmic pattern a telegraph operator could spell out words, with each dot-dash sequence representing a corresponding letter in a word. Using this technology planes were able to call in accurate artillery fire and act as forward observers. In 1912 the Royal Flying Corps had begun experimenting with \\"wireless telegraphy\\" in aircraft. Lieutenant B.T James was a leading pioneer of wireless (radio) in aircraft. In the spring 1913, he had begun to experiment with radios in a B.E.2a. James brought the science of wireless in aircraft to a high state of efficiency before he was shot down and killed by anti-aircraft fire on 13 July 1915. In April 1915 Captain J.M. Furnival was the first person to hear a voice from the ground when Major Prince said ‚ÄúIf you can hear me now it will be the first time speech has ever been communicated to an aeroplane in flight.‚Äù In June 1915 the world's first air-to-ground voice transmission took place at Brooklands (England) over about 20miles (ground-to-air was initially by morse but it is believed two-way voice communications was being achieved by July 1915). In early 1916 the Marconi Company (England) started production of air- to-ground radio transmitters/receivers which were used in the war over France. In 1917 AT&T; invented the first American air-to-ground radio transmitter. They tested this device at Langley Field in Virginia and found it was a viable technology. In May 1917, General George Squier of the U.S. Army Signal Corps contacted AT&T; to develop an air-to-ground radio with a range of 2,000 yards. By July 4 of that same year AT&T; technicians achieved two-way communication between pilots and ground personnel. This allowed ground personnel to communicate directly with pilots using their voice instead of morse code. Though few of these devices saw service in the war, they proved this was a viable and valuable technology worthy of refinement and advancement therefore further models had this technology installed into Biplanes on airstrips in France 1919.https://www.loc.gov/resource/19013740/1919-01-01/ed-1/?sp=281 The inter-war years Following World War I new technology was developed to increase the range and performance of the radios being used to communicate with planes in the air. It was not until 1930 however that airborne radios were reliable enough and had enough power to make them viable to be standard in all planes. Until this point only planes designated for scout missions required radios. The operating distance of radios increased much slower than the distance planes were able to travel. This resulted in planes messages having to bounce from airfield to airfield in order to get to its intended recipient. As the speed of planes increased this resulted in a plane reaching its destination before the message that it was on its way arrived at the airfield. On 15 November 1938 the Army Airways Communications System (AACS) was established, this system was a point-to-point communications system used by the Army Air Corps. It allowed army air fields to remain in contact with planes throughout their entire flight. It could also be used to disseminate weather reports and orders to military aircraft and act as an air traffic control for arrivals and departures at military airfields. As technology increased systems such as the AACS expanded and spread across the globe as other militaries and civilian services developed their own system of air control. The R1155/T1154 combination used by the RAF in WWII World War II The development of radar in the mid-1930s proved a great advance in air-to- ground communication. Radar could be used to track planes in the air and determine distance, direction, speed and even type of aircraft. This allowed for better air traffic control as well as navigation aides for pilots. Radar also proved to be a valuable tool in targeting for bombers. Radar stations on the coast of Britain could aim two radar beams from separate locations on the coast towards Germany. By aligning the two radar beams to intersect over the desired target, a town or factory for example, a bomber could then follow one radar signal until it intersected with the other where he would then know to drop his bombs. The Royal Air Force used the R1155/T1154 receiver/transmitter combination in most of its larger aircraft, particularly the Avro Lancaster and Short Sunderland. Single seat aircraft such as the Spitfire and Hurricane were equipped mostly with the TR1143 set. Other systems employed were Eureka and the S-Phone, which enabled Special Operations Executive agents working behind enemy lines to communicate with friendly aircraft and coordinate landings and the dropping of agents and supplies. Today Radar is still used as an invaluable tool in air to ground communications. Today every plane in the air is tracked by Air Traffic control towers across the US. Most planes in the US and all Commercial planes carry a device known as a transponder. The transponder acts as an identification tool for aircraft allowing ATC towers to immediately recognize the identity of each plane. They work by recognizing radar frequencies as they interact with the plane. The transponder alerted by the radar responds by sending a signal of its own back to the Tower, which identifies the aircraft. Transponders can be used to avoid collisions with other aircraft and with the ground. Today Air-to Ground communication has evolved to the point where pilots no longer need to be in the plane to fly it. These planes are known as unmanned aerial vehicles or more commonly UAVs. The US military uses several types of UAVs, these include the Predator, Reaper and Global Hawk drones. These drones are used for video surveillance and more recently air to ground attacks. These aircraft represent the pinnacle of Air- to-Ground communications. They can be controlled by pilots thousands of miles away and can safely navigate treacherous terrain using ground mapping radars. They are able to transmit high-resolution video to military stations across the globe. Not all UAVs are used for military purposes however. Some are equipped with high tech sensors, which enable them to survey the ground. These sensors are able to be used for geographical surveys to map the earth and look for oil and mineral deposits. Despite nearly a century of innovation in air- to-ground communications, many of the original techniques used to communicate with the ground are used by today‚Äôs aircraft. Planes landing at night are guided into the runway by a series of intricate lighting arrangements. These visual aids allow pilots to orient themselves in zero visibility situations. Military personnel also rely heavily on visual aides to distinguish themselves and enemy. All Army ACU uniforms include what are known as IR tabs which when viewed through night vision goggles glow bright, US Helicopter pilots can distinguish between soldiers on the ground and the enemy by these tabs.

Retrieved on 13 May 2019. According to its mission statement, the IAS \\"supports innovative research and creative activity across disciplines, facilitates collaboration, fosters critical engagement with issues and ideas, and builds generative relationships between the University and the larger communities locally and globally.\\" It accomplishes this mission by providing fellowships and administrative support that encourage interdisciplinary and collaborative research and creative work across the University and beyond. The Institute is a member of the Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes and Humanities Without Walls. Programming The IAS describes itself as a resource for scholars, artists, professionals, and students who are engaged in a wide variety of study and practice. It also serves as a bridge between the University and the wider community as a place where people meet and ideas are exchanged. The IAS provides independent research support to faculty members and graduate student fellows, structural and funding support for interdisciplinary collaboration, and a host of other programs and opportunities for faculty, students, staff, and community members, such as workshops, forums, symposia, and conferences on a variety of subjects that lend themselves to interdisciplinary exploration. Most events are intended to appeal to a nonspecialist audience, and since 2008, most have been recorded and are freely available via the IAS website. The IAS serves as a catalyst for new work that otherwise may not have found a disciplinary home, such as the Moving Cell Project, a collaboration between choreographer Carl Flink, professor of theatre arts and dance at UMN and artistic director of dance ensemble Black Label Movement, and David Odde, professor of biomedical engineering at UMN.The Twin Cities Public Television series Minnesota Originals featured the Moving Cell Project in Season 3 Episode 325, available at: https://www.tpt.org/mn-original/video/HIT--The-Moving-Cell- Project-594336H-1/ Retrieved 13 May 2019 The Institute also serves as the home for recipients of UMN's Graduate School‚Äôs Interdisciplinary Doctoral Fellowship and for recipients of external fellowships such as those provided by the National Endowment for the Humanities.

The IAS' public programming was developed as a forum for speakers from within the University as well as visiting scholars, artists, and practitioners to showcase their research and creative work in an interdisciplinary and non-specialist space. The IAS has had participation from virtually every college and school on the Twin Cities campus of the University of Minnesota and has had participation from every University of Minnesota system coordinate campus in one or more of its core programs. In summer 2019, the IAS began an environmental humanities project called the Mellon Environmental Stewardship, Place, and Community Initiative (MESPAC), funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. MESPAC will be a three-year project bringing together faculty, staff, and students on the Twin Cities, Duluth, and Morris campuses of UMN as well as community partners. It seeks to expand the methods of the humanities and create greater intellectual diversity in the academy by incorporating local, community-based participatory research and Indigenous epistemologies into humanities scholarship and curricula.https://ias.umn.edu/mespac Retrieved on 13 May 2019.

Its original name (with diacritics) is JalpƒÅna. The village gets its name from the Jalap tribe, who were said to be founders of the village. This was a very small settlement with uncultivated surroundings. In 1860s when India was under the British Raj, they started selling uncultivated lands of different areas of this region under they colonization policy, Khan Mohammed Sarfaraz Khan from Isakhel Niazi Pathan clan bought this land with his brothers with a total area of 200 squares (5000 acres) for the sum of Rs.18,000. Khan began to encourage settlers from the local tribes. The village was now home to a number of Jat clans. Then came the process of getting this area cultivated. For cultivation, water is necessary, and thus the first ever canal of Punjab was dug from river Jahlum to Jalpana by the Khan himself. The land on which a canal was dug was also bought by Khan from the local land owners. He dug out a canal on his personal expense to irrigate barren lands of not only this village but surrounding villages also. The farmers of these surrounding villages paid one-fourth of their agricultural produce to Khan M. Sarfaraz Khan in lieu of irrigation water used from this canal. This privately owned and managed irrigation system worked successfully for almost a century when Punjab government under CM Mumtaz Doultana nationalized all privately owned irrigation systems in Punjab in 1950s. Subsequently, the management of this canal was handed over to Irrigation department of Punjab by Shahnawaz Khan Niazi in 1970s. Throughout the 1960s, the village was subject to a number of studies by the anthropologist Saghir Ahmad of Simon Fraser University, who studied the society and culture of Punjabi villages.

It operated from 1924 to 1990. For most of its existence the station broadcast on 1280 kHz on the AM band, using a daytime power of 10,000 watts and a nighttime power of 5,000 watts as a class B station, using a directional antenna with different patterns day and night.

At the time the station only used a power of 50 watts and operated on 880 kHz, sharing the frequency with CHRC. The station changed frequencies several times. CKCV moved to 600 kHz in 1928, moved back to 880 kHz the following year, and moved to 1310 kHz in 1933. In 1936 power was increased to 100 watts. Like most stations in North America, CKCV had to move again on March 29, 1941, due to the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement; the station landed on 1340 kHz. The station moved to 1280 kHz by 1947 and increased its power to 1,000 watts. Another power increase was implemented by 1963; CKCV now used 10,000 watts during the day and 5,000 watts at night. Originally, it aired programming in both French and English; at one point it was an affiliate of the CBC's supplementary francophone radio network, L'Association de Radio Fran√ßais, as well as a secondary affiliate of the CBC's English networks, the Trans-Canada Network and the Dominion Network. In 1962, however, all English programming was dropped. CKCV was sold to a group of local investors in 1973 (Richard Drouin, Benoit Roberge, Jocelyne Grimard Roberge and Marthe Roberge Drouin); this sale meant that the station was no longer co-owned with rival CHRC as it had been for most of its existence. CKCV was sold again the following year, this time to Telemedia. In 1980, the station increased its power to 50,000 watts full-time from a new site in Saint-Augustin-de-Desmaures, but CKCV was forced to move back a few years later to its old technical parameters and transmitter site in Saint- David-de-l'Auberivi√®re (now part of L√©vis) due to interference complaints. The station was closed on September 21, 1990.Decision CRTC 91-354 CKCV's licence was revoked by the CRTC (Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission) on May 30, 1991.Decision CRTC 91-353 In a separate decision published on that date, the CRTC refused Telemedia's application to buy CHRC (at the time it was illegal for one company to own more than one AM station per market).

In London, he completed his medical education under David Pitcairn at St. Bartholomew's Hospital. He passed the first years of his professional life at Manchester and Oxford, where in both places he was elected physician to the respective infirmaries. In 1788 he returned to London, and the next year was admitted Fellow of the College of Physicians. In a few months he was elected physician to the Middlesex Hospital, afterwards to the Magdalen, and in the year 1792, succeeded David Pitcairn at St. Bartholomew's, about which time he settled in Bedford Row, and remained there until 1808, when he moved to Harley Street. In 1790, he was appointed Physician Extraordinary to the Prince of Wales, and afterwards re- appointed to the same office in the household of George IV. He was a regular attendant at the College of Physicians, where he was elected censor (examiner) in 1790, delivered the Gulstonian lectures in 1793, the Harveian oration in 1794, and the Croonian lecture in 1795.

Anita McConnell, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 He is the son of John Latham (1761‚Äì1843). Born at Oxford, 18 March 1787, Latham was the eldest son of the late John Latham, M.D., F.R.S., sometime President of the Royal College of Physicians, and, as a coheir of the Cheshire families of Mere and Arderne, derived maternally a recorded descent from most of the ancient houses of that palatinate. He was admitted to Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1803, and during his residence there he obtained the Chancellor's prize for his Latin poem on the subject of Trafalgar in 1806. The same honour was awarded in 1809 and 1812 to the several and successive prize poems of his two younger brothers, namely Dr. Latham, now of Grosvenor-street, and the Rev. Henry Latham, M.A. Vicar of Fittleworth, in Sussex, then resident members of the same college. The same three brothers, in 1844 joined in the presentation of a memorial window to the parish church of Sandbach, in remembrance of their departed parents. In 1806 Mr. Latham was elected a Fellow of All Souls' College, Oxford, and afterwards proceeded B.C.L. 1810, D.C.L. 1815. He came into possession of his Cheshire estates on the demise of his father, 20 April 1843, and after this, to the close of his life, he continued resident at his paternal seat, discharging his duty as a county magistrate, and taking an active interest in the educational and charitable trusts of his neighbourhood. Mr. Latham married, on 24 May 1821, Elizabeth-Anne, eldest daughter of Sir Henry Dampier, one of the justices of the King's Bench. In 1839 he sustained the loss of his wife, and this was followed by the death of his eldest son, John Henry Latham, a youth of distinguished classical attainments and rare promise. Three of his children survived him: George William, of Bradwall Hall, M.A. and barrister-at-law; Francis-Law; and Mary-Frances, wife of the Rev. Ambrose Jones, M.A. incumbent of Elworth, Cheshire.

Around 1796, he was transferred to the Grammar School of Macclesfield, and on to Brasenose College, Oxford in 1807. He took his M.D. degree at Oxford in 1818, and in the same year became a Fellow of the College of Physicians. He delivered their Gulstonian lectures in 1819 and the Harveian oration in 1839. In 1815 he was elected physician to the Middlesex Hospital, and to St Bartholomew's in 1824. On her accession in 1837, he was appointed physician extraordinary to Queen Victoria. He retired to Torquay in 1865, where he died on 20 July 1875, age 86. He was married twice.

In 1784 John Latham had married Mary Mayer (born January 7, 1756), the daughter of Reverend Peter Mayer of St. Peter's Church in Prestbury, Cheshire. Sarah Latham was their eldest daughter. She lived the first years of her life in Manchester where her father practiced medicine. At the age of three, she moved to Oxford where John Latham became a physician at the Radcliffe Infirmary. In 1788, the family moved to London and John was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1789 and served as physician extraordinary to the Prince of Wales beginning in 1795. In 1802, he purchased Bradwall Hall in Sandbach, Cheshire and began living in the countryside. In 1808, Sarah Latham married George Ormerod, a landed Cheshire magistrate and historian. They lived successively in Rawtenstall, Lancashire; Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire; and Damhouse in Astley, Greater Manchester. Their sons Thomas Johnson Ormerod and George Wareing Ormerod were born in 1809 and 1810 respectively. In 1811, the couple moved to Chorlton House, which was situated four miles from Chester and allowed George to research the county for his three-volume History of Cheshire, published between 1816 and 1819. They lived at Chorlton until 1823, and had five more sons and three daughters. Their children were: * Thomas Johnson Ormerod (1809‚Äì74), religious minister, married Maria Susan Bailey (daughter of MP Joseph Bailey). * George Wareing Ormerod (1810‚Äì91), solicitor and geologist, died unmarried. * John Arderne Ormerod (1813‚Äì64), religious minister, died unmarried. * Susan Mary Ormerod (1814‚Äì96), amateur watercolorist, died unmarried. * Henry Mere Ormerod (1816‚Äì98), solicitor, married Madalina Clementina Bowers in 1874. * William Piers Ormerod (1818‚Äì60), anatomist and surgeon, unmarried. * Edward Latham Ormerod (1819‚Äì73), physician, married Mary Olivia Porter in 1853 and Maria Millet in 1856. * Arthur Stanley Ormerod (1821‚Äì84), religious minister, died unmarried. * Georgiana Elizabeth Ormerod (1822‚Äì96), scientific illustrator, died unmarried. * Eleanor Anne Ormerod (1828‚Äì1901), entomologist, died unmarried. Living in rural Cheshire and, after 1823, at Sedbury Park in Gloucestershire, the Ormerod family was relatively insulated and tight-knit. Sarah Ormerod educated her children herself from an early age. Many of her sons continued their educations at Oxford; educator Thomas Arnold praised their early home education. Ormerod also firmly believed in educating her daughters, though their educations were constricted to traditional subjects and values of upper class English women in the early nineteenth century. She taught them biblical studies, English, French, geography, music, and sewing, as well as drawing. Ormerod also assisted her daughters Susan Mary, Eleanor and Georgiana with their studies of natural history and art. Eleanor Anne Ormerod became a celebrated entomologist who published extensively in her later years and Georgiana became the illustrator of her findings. Sarah Ormerod was herself a skilled artist and had great interest in botany, which she impressed upon her children and developed through scientific illustration She studied oil painting as a young woman at the encouragement of sculptor and family friend John Flaxman. She engaged watercolorists Copley Fielding and William Hunt in her daughters‚Äô education and produced oil paintings and graphite drawings. Though not widely recognized as an artist during her life, her graphite drawings were exhibited alongside Georgiana Ormerod's entomological watercolors in 2014 at the Natural History Museum, London. Sarah Ormerod died at 75 years of age on 11 April 1860 and was buried at Sedbury Park, Gloucestershire.

Charles was the third son of Richard and Sarah Latham, and the nephew of John Latham (1761‚Äì1843). He went to Manchester Hospital, where he was apprenticed for 5 years to Scottish surgeon, Dr. John Robertson. After his apprenticeship, he became dresser at the Manchester Infirmary, and then moved to London where he obtained the certificates, of M.R.C.S., and L.S.A at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, and then returned to Sandbach, and became a partner with Mr. Sutton. On 29 March 1842, he was appointed medical officer of health for the Sandbach Relief District, a position he held for a period of 57 years, retiring on 22 December 1899. On 25 March 1845 he was appointed medical officer to the District (when the workhouse was opened), a position he held for nearly 60 years. For over 30 years he was public vaccinator, and surgeon to the Bradwall Reformatory from its foundation until 19 March 1903 when he retired. For some time he was also registrar of births and deaths, a duty which he handed over to his son in 1888. In 1843 he married Miss Mary Newnham Cobbe, daughter of Mr. William Venables Cobbe, of the Hough, near Wybunbury.

George William Latham, the son of John Latham (1787‚Äì1853), was an English landowner, barrister and a Liberal politician. He was born in London on 4 May 1827. He was educated at Brasenose College, Oxford, matriculating on 22 May 1845, B.A., 1849; M.A., 1852. He was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple in 1852, and for a time practised on the Chester and North Wales circuit. On ceasing to practise he went to live at Bradwall Hall, and took an active part in the affairs of the county, particularly in relation to reformatory and industrial schools, one of which he established on his own property (Bradwall Reformatory School).The Irish quarterly review, Volume 5, Publisher W.B. Kelly, 1855. (page li) He took great interest in agriculture and farming, and was an active member of the Cheshire Chamber of Agriculture. In politics he was an enthusiastic and advanced Liberal, and in the Parliamentary election of 1878 he contested Mid-Cheshire against Col. Egerton Leigh, by whom he was defeated by a large majority. In 1880 he again contested that constituency, and once more in 1883, but was defeated on both occasions, but by reduced majorities. In 1885 he was, however, elected Member of Parliament for the Crewe division, defeating his opponent, Mr. O. Leslie Stephen, a director of the London and North-Western Railway, by 808 votes. At the next election, in June, 1886, he could not again offer himself as a candidate, owing to serious ill-health, and on 4 October 1886, he died at Bradwall Hall.John Parsons Earwaker, The History of the Ancient Parish of Sandbach, Co.

They suggested that newspapers, broadcasters and journalists had started to become more responsible for journalism and thought they should be held accountable.  Original Guidelines  The guidelines were set up around two important ideas. The first guideline is that \\"whoever enjoys a special measure of freedom, like a professional journalist, has an obligation to society to use their freedoms and powers responsibly.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 477) This guideline is useful so that people in power are able to be held liable in case their actions are not professional. People that have high media attention should not abuse the power. The second guideline that was established is \\"society's welfare is paramount, more important than individual careers or even individual rights.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 477) Again, holding people responsible for their actions and stating that society is more important due to the vast number of people that could be affected by poor behavior. The Hutchins Commission added another five guidelines specifically for the press. # \\"Present meaningful news, accurate and separated from opinion\\". (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 477) # \\"Serve as a forum for the exchange of comment and criticism and to expand access to diverse points of view.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 477) # \\"Project \\"a representative picture of the constituent groups in society\\" by avoiding stereotypes by including minority groups.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 477) # \\"Clarify the goals and values of society; implicit was an appeal to avoid pandering to the lowest common denominator.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 477) # \\"Give broad coverage of what was known about society\\". (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 477) All of these guidelines are important because the press is needed to maintain a neutral viewpoint, providing the basic facts and allowing for readers to come up with their own opinions from the news that they report. These guidelines provide the frame work and inspiration for the Fourth Estate's Journalism Code of Practice and the Society of Professional Journalists Code of Ethics .  Fourth Estate: Journalism Code of Practice  The Fourth Estate offers a clear and detailed Code of Practice for anyone seeking to create ethical, principled journalism, regardless of their background, employment status, or means of delivery. This code is equally relevant for professional journalists and for those outside the profession who are seeking to report honestly and fairly on the events and issues relevant to their community. = Accuracy = Accuracy, moreso than exclusivity or timeliness, is the overriding value of journalism. * Ensure that all the facts in your work are accurate. * Do not omit facts that are material to an understanding of what you are reporting on. * Context is often critical to accurate reporting. Ensure that adequate context is provided. * Clearly distinguish between fact and assertion or opinion. = Independence = Independence from state control, business interests, market forces, or any other vested interest or outside pressure is a hallmark of dispassionate, critical, and reliable journalism. It bolsters legitimacy and credibility in the eyes of the public. * Make your own editorial judgments based only on careful consideration of all the facts. * Do not allow yourself to be influenced by political, sectional, or commercial interests. * Declare and manage any conflicts of interest, including gifts, funding, advertising relationships, and free or discounted travel or services. = Impartiality = Impartiality means not being prejudiced towards or against any particular ideology, idea, or preconception. Impartiality requires fairness and balance that follows the weight of evidence: it allows the journalist to make sense of events through dispassionate analysis of all relevant facts and perspectives. * Treat all facts the same, making editorial judgments and delivering analysis based only on the weight of evidence. * Do not allow your own views, preferences, biases, or prejudgements to affect your work. Set them aside. * Do not simply recite lists of facts or engage in false balance: weigh the evidence and reflect that weight of evidence in your work. * Aim to include an appropriate diversity of views, and accord those views the space warranted by their prominence and significance. = Integrity = Integrity in journalism ensures that people and organizations uphold the values of journalism, always strive to do the right thing in all situations, even to their personal or organizational detriment, and put their obligations to the public first. * Treat those you deal with in your work with respect and courtesy. * Always identify yourself as a journalist, unless withholding disclosure is essential to uncovering the truth in a matter of public importance. * As far as possible, look for opportunities to ‚Äúshow your workings,‚Äù sharing with the public the underlying information you have gathered. * The use of any form of secret information gathering (hidden cameras, secret recording devices, etc‚Ä¶) may be justifiable if it is essential to uncovering the truth in a matter of public importance. * Provide anyone accused of misbehavior a reasonable opportunity to respond. * Attribute information to its source unless that source needs to be protected to ensure the truth can be uncovered in a matter of public importance. Where a source needs anonymity, provide it. * Do not plagiarize. = Harm Minimization = Journalists must always remember that they are dealing with human lives. The potential for public good must sufficiently outweigh the potential for harm that may come from the activity of journalism. * Be mindful that your work may contain content that causes harm. Carefully consider how you proceed to ensure that undue harm is not caused. * Avoid the gratuitous use of offensive, confronting, or harm-inducing sounds, imagery, or words. * Respect people‚Äôs reasonable rights to privacy unless they are outweighed by the need to report on a matter of public importance. * Show sensitivity when dealing with children, victims of crime, or people who are especially vulnerable due, for example, to trauma, injury, illness, or other factors. = Engagement = Engagement with the public ensures that journalism remains open, accessible, collaborative, and participatory while keeping the journalist accountable to the highest standards of accuracy, independence, impartiality, and integrity. * Your decisions on what work to do should be based on what is relevant and newsworthy to the community you serve. * Establish and maintain open communications with the community. * Seek input and ideas from the community before, during, and after completing your work. = Accountability = Accountability is essential to the ethical practice of journalism and the maintenance of the public trust. Being accountable for news-gathering practices and reporting means making firm commitments and taking responsibility for your journalism and the journalism of your peers. * Seek and carefully consider the feedback you receive from the community about your work. * Respond constructively to any complaints, particularly those related to matters raised in relation to these standards. * Where errors or potentially incomplete or misleading information is found, corrections or clarifications should be made promptly, prominently, and transparently. * Where no errors or incomplete or misleading information is found, your work should not be altered or removed in any material way in response to pressure from outside interests.  Society of Professional Journalists: Code of Ethics  The Society of Professional Journalists created a code of ethics that are in effect today. The main mantra of the code is \\"Seek truth and Report it!\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) The code also states that: \\"Journalists should be honest, fair, and courageous in gathering, reporting, and interpreting information. Journalists should: \\" * \\"Test the accuracy of information from all sources and exercise care to avoid inadvertent error. Deliberate distortion is never permissible.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) * \\"Diligently seek out subjects of news stories to give them the opportunity to respond to allegations of wrongdoing.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) * \\"Identify sources whenever feasible. The public is entitled to as much information as possible on sources' reliability.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) * \\"Always question sources' motives before promising anonymity. Clarify conditions attached to any promise made in exchange for information. Keep promises.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) * \\"Make certain that headlines, news teases, and promotional material, photos, video, audio, graphics, sound bites, and quotations do not misrepresent. They should not oversimplify or highlight incidents out of context.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) * \\"Never distort the content of news photos or video. Image enhancement for technical clarity is always permissible. Label montages and photo illustrations.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) * \\"Avoid misleading reenactments or staged news events. If reenactment is necessary to tell a story, label it.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) * \\"Avoid undercover or other surreptitious methods of gathering information except when traditional open methods will not yield information vital to the public. Use of such methods should be explained as part of the story.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) * \\"Never plagiarize.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) * \\"Tell the story of the diversity and magnitude of the human experience boldly, even, when it is unpopular to do so.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) * \\"Examine their own cultural values and avoid imposing on those values on others.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) * \\"Avoid stereotyping by race, gender, age, religion, ethnicity, geography, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, or social status.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) * \\"Support the open exchange of views, even views they find repugnant.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) * \\"Give voice to the voiceless; official and unofficial sources of information can be equally valid.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) * \\"Distinguish between advocacy and news reporting. Analysis and commentary should be labeled and not misrepresent fact or content.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) * \\"Distinguish news from advertising, and shun hybrids that blur the lines between the two.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) * \\"Recognize and special obligation to ensure that the public's business is conducted in the open and that government records are open to inspection.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) Minimize Harm \\"Ethical journalists treat sources, subjects, and colleagues as human beings deserving of respect. Journalists should: \\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) * \\"Show compassion for those who may be affected adversely by news coverage. Use special sensitivity when dealing with children and inexperienced sources or subjects.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) * \\"Be sensitive when seeking or using interviews or photographs of those affected by tragedy or guilt.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) * \\"Recognize that gathering and reporting information may cause harm or discomfort. Pursuit of the news is not a license for arrogance.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) * \\"Recognize that private people have a greater right to control information about themselves that do public officials and others who seek power, influence, or attention. Only an overriding public need can justify intrusion into anyone's privacy.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) * \\"Show good taste. Avoid pandering to lurid curiosity.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) * \\"Be cautious of identifying juvenile suspects or victims of sex crimes.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) * \\"Be judicious about naming criminal suspects before the formal filing of charges.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) * \\"Balance a criminal suspect's fair trial rights with the public's right to be informed.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) Act Independently \\"Journalists should be free of obligation to any interest other than the public's right to know. Journalists should: \\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) * \\"Avoid conflict of interest, real or perceived.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) * \\"Remain free of associations and activities that may compromise integrity or damage credibility.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) * \\"Refuse gifts, favors, fees, free travel, and special treatment, and shun secondary employment, political involvement, public office, and service in community organizations if they compromise journalistic integrity.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 478) * \\"Disclose unavoidable conflicts.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 479) * \\"Be vigilant and courageous about holding those with power accountable.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 479) * \\"Deny favored treatment to advertisers and special interests and resist their pressure to influence news coverage.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 479) * \\"Be wary of sources offering information for favors or money; avoid bidding for news.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 479) Be Accountable \\"Journalists are accountable to their readers, listeners, viewers, and each other. Journalists should: \\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 479) * \\"Clarify and explain news coverage and invite dialogue with the public over journalistic conduct.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 479) * \\"Encourage the public to voice grievances against the news media.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 479) * \\"Admit mistakes and correct them promptly.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 479) * \\"Expose unethical practices of journalists and the news media.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 479) * \\"Abide by the same high standards to which they hold others.\\" (Straubhaar, LaRose & Davenport, Pg 479) All of these guidelines are for the betterment of society and regulation of media.

Amedisys provides in-home skilled nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech language pathology, medical social work, home aides, and hospice and bereavement services, with 11 million patient care visits in 2011. Amedisys employs more than 16,000 individuals at more than 500 locations in 45 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico. In 2010, annual revenues were approximately $1.6 billion. Amedisys was ranked 999 on the Fortune 1000 in 2011.  History and governance  Amedisys was founded in 1982 by William F. Borne, a registered nurse from Reserve, Louisiana, who has served as chief executive officer (CEO) and chairman of the board since that time. In 1993, the company completed a reverse acquisition with M&N; Capital Corp, and began trading on the NASDAQ Small Cap Market in 1994. Additional public offerings of its common stock were completed in 2004 and 2006. As of Nov. 6, 2011, the members of the board of directors of Amedisys are: William F. Borne, chairman; Don Washburn, lead director; Ronald LaBorde; Jake L. Netterville, CPA; David Pitts, and Peter Ricchiuti. Borne resigned as CEO, chairman, and director of Amedisys on February 24, 2014, 33 years after founding the company, and was named Chairman Emeritus by the company's Board of Directors. Ronald (Ronnie) A. LaBorde was named Interim CEO, having been Amedisys president and chief financial office for two years, and a member of the Board of Directors for 17 years. In June 2011, Amedisys closed the acquisition of Beacon Hospice, a New England provider of hospice services with 24 locations in five states. In March 2008, Amedisys closed the acquisition of TLC Health Care Services, a home health provider with more than 100 locations. Amedisys announced March 28, 2014, it was closing 29 care centers (23 home health and six hospice) and consolidating another 25 (21 home health and four hospice). The Concord (NH) office of Beacon Hospice was closed on April 30, 2014. Hyder Family Hospice House (Dover, NH), one of the facilities in the Beacon Hospice acquisition, was also to be closed. Hyder House was the only in-patient hospice facility in Strafford County, NH. (Hyder House was expected to transfer to county ownership on August 1, 2014.) Amedisys announced a $150-million settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice on April 23, 2014. This settlement was about Medicare reimbursements for home health services by some Amedisys care centers from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2010, as well as a Stark Law infraction involving care services provided to a physician group in exchange for compensation inconsistent with fair market value from April 1, 2008, through April 30, 2012, an issue Amedisys had voluntarily disclosed. The $150 million included more than $26 million to settle six whistleblower lawsuits in Pennsylvania and one in Georgia. The $150 million is five times what a leading analyst in the industry estimates Amedisys will earn in 2014 before income taxes, depreciation, and amortization.  Recognitions  Amedisys is accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Health Care (ACHC). In June 2011, three Amedisys care centers were awarded the first Integrated Health Care Standards Accreditation for Behavioral Health Disorders by ACHC. In 2010 and 2011, under the Medicare Home Health Pay for Performance (HHP4P) demonstration Amedisys received the largest reward in both years ($3.6 million in 2010, $4.7 million in 2011). HHP4P shared more than $15 million in savings with 166 home health agencies that either maintained high levels of quality or made significant improvements in quality of care. In July 2011, Amedisys was named Innovator of the Year during the 2011 Louisiana Governor‚Äôs Technology Awards for its patient care management web application for physicians, Mercury Doc. In October 2011, over 250 Amedisys agencies were named to the 2011 HomeCare Elite, a compilation of the top-performing home health agencies based on quality outcomes, quality improvement and financial performance. One-hundred-four Amedisys care centers have been honored multiple times, including 13 that have been acknowledged every year since the inception of the HomeCare Elite in 2005. In 2010, Amedisys launched the first nationwide home health care transitions program, aiming to reduce unnecessary hospital readmissions through patient education and care coordination. The program and a Georgia case study demonstrating a downward trend in acute care hospitalization rate were highlighted in Home Health Quality Improvement Campaign's Cross Settings I ‚Äì Best Practice Intervention Package.  Foundation and charitable giving  In 2005, Amedisys established a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, the Christen Foundation, to distribute contributions to local nonprofit organizations and employees in need. The Christen Foundation also administers donations to Amedisys‚Äô Hospice Fund. Amedisys employees‚Äô contributions rank second in the nation in fundraising for the American Heart Association, next to only the American Heart Association itself.

Research and history It was discovered in 2005 by K. Helgen,Dictionary of Australian and New Guinean mammals, Ronald Strahan, Pamela Conder, 2007, access date 06-11-2011. and later was assessed by Helgen, and A. Allison in 2008. The water rat was named in honor of the deceased Dr. Alan C. Ziegler from the Bishop Museum. It has been rated as data deficient for the purposes of the IUCN redlist because insufficient is known about the creature's population range, threats, and numbers. Only two specimens have ever been recorded by scientists. The water rat may be threatened by logging of its forest habitat but more research is needed to codify this theory. It is also believed it may inhabit the northern slopes of its mountain home but study is needed to determine this as fact. Habitat This species inhabits both terrestrial and freshwater systems. This includes forests, subtropical and tropical moist lowland forests, inland wetlands, permanent watercourses, and artificial terrestrial areas. The animal has only been recorded in Bainyik, located on the south slopes of the Prince Alexander Mountains at an elevation of 200 meters (650 feet). The rat has been found to live in creeks and rivers in low lying tropical rain forests but it may also live in higher elevations.

It was situated on the River Blanche, a tributary of the Dendre, about 9 kilometres to the south-east of Ath. Dissolved in 1782, parts of the abbey still survive as ruins.  History  = Heroic Beginnings = Twelve monks from Clairvaux arrived at Cambron on August 1, 1148. They were sent by St. Bernard, abbot of Clairvaux, at the invitation of Anselm of Trazegnies, lord of P√©ronnes-lez-Binche and canon and treasurer of the Collegiate Chapter of Soignies, who offered land on the banks of the Dender for the foundation of an abbey. Living conditions were rudimentary. However, the Cistercian Order had already become prestigious. A Cistercian, the abbot of Tre Fontaine, had just been elected as Pope Eugene III. According to √âmile Poumon, St. Bernard stayed in Hainaut in 1148, when the abbey was founded. St. Bernard visited Cambron in 1150, by which time the monks were facing significant difficulties. The endowment from Anselm of Trazegnies was contested by his brother Gilles of Silly. The abbey, however, managed to win the case. The first abbots were skilled administrators, as well as religious men, who brought together temporal competence and spiritual vigor. Fastr√© de Gaviamez, the second successor to St. Bernard, was an especially successful abbot. Shortly after its foundation, the abbey grew substantially. It became one of the wealthiest monasteries of Hainault and variously founded, or was given the supervision of, several daughter houses: the abbeys of Fontenelle at Valenciennes (1212), Nieuwenbosch near Ghent (1215), √âpinlieu at Mons (1216), Beaupr√© near Mechelen (1221), Le Refuge at Ath (1224), Le Verger at Cambrai (1225) and Baudeloo at Saint-Nicolas (1225). Two bishops, attracted by the holiness of the site, decided to retire there. Didier, Bishop of Th√©rouanne, wished to consecrate the last years of his life to prayer and contemplation. He retired to Cambron, where he died in 1196. The other, Henry, was a worldly and corrupt bishop who received a terrifying vision of the punishments of Hell. He reformed himself, renounced his worldly affairs, and spent the rest of his life as a simple monk at Cambron. When Fastr√© of Gaviamez was promoted to Clairvaux, G√©rard of Burgundy (a relative of St. Bernard) replaced him at Cambron. He retired after eight years. Daniel de Grammont, the Blessed, was elected the third abbot, and served until his death in 1196. = Century of Knowledge = At the end of the 13th century, Baudouin of Boussu, doctor of theology, was appointed to succeed Thomas d'Aquin at the University of Paris. He wrote a commentary on the \\"Book of Sentences,\\" and left behind some collections of sermons. As the eleventh abbot of Cambron, he was a great promoter and organizer of theological studies. Cambron has since produced numerous theologians and intellectuals. Several enjoy great renown. = Notre- Dame de Cambron = In 1322 there was a serious incident at Cambron. An image of the Virgin Mary was profaned. The widely held suspicion was that a Jewish perpetrator had falsified conversion to Christianity to gain access to the image. The affair caused significant unrest, and provoked the sympathy of many Christians. There were ceremonies held to repair the image. Thus the devotion to Our Lady of Cambron was begun. After a request by the King of France Philip of Valois, Pope Benedict XII issued a Papal Bull granting indulgences to pilgrims to Cambron. The pilgrimage to the Virgin of Cambron was thus begun. A solemn procession takes place each year on the third Sunday of Easter. Among the pilgrims and visitors were several important figures, including the Emperor Maximilian I, who, passing through Belgium in the early 16th century, visited the sanctuary of Our Lady of Cambron. He gave the abbey sufficient funds to commission the restoration of the painted image. In 1581, under the abbot Robert d'Ostelart, a troop of 600 Huguenots threatened to assault the abbey. However, they left the area without doing any damage. This seemingly miraculous circumstance was attributed by the monks to the protection of Our Lady of Cambron. This renewed devotion to the Virgin. = Renaissance = By the end of the 14th century, there were more than 70 monks at Cambron pursuing the abbey's charitable mission. The monks increasingly recruited the aid of lay-brothers to tend the fields. The contribution of agricultural techniques to the local peasantry substantially improved both the status of the rural class and the local economy. After facing difficulties in the 15th century, the abbey contributed greatly in the 16th century to the renaissance in the arts and in theology. The master of novices Andr√© Enobarb, a distinguished humanist who corresponded with Erasmus, wrote a Latin tragedy about the miracles of Our Lady of Cambron. The abbot Robert d'Ostelart (d. 1613), supported the college in Ath and provided scholarships for theology students at Leuven. There were many other eminent monks at Cambron. Jean d'Assignies and Gregory de Lattefleur would both later become abbot of Nizelles. Baudouin Moreau, author of a famous commentary on the Rule of St. Benedict, became an emissary of the Cistercian Order in Rome. Jean Farinart, of Chi√®vres, who succeeded Robert d'Ostelart as abbot, was an excellent theologian and doctor of theology at Douai. Antoine Le Waitte, author of a history of Cambron Abbey (1672), was the abbey's librarian and significantly expanded its collections. = 17th and 18th Centuries = By the 17th century, the abbey had become rich from years of gifts, legacies, and productive agriculture. The abbey enjoyed great renown, but strict adherence to monastic life had begun to loosen. The abbey's wealth attracted the envy of others. At the end of the 17th century, the wars of King Louis XIV devastated the province of Hainaut and set off the abbey's first period of decline. At the beginning of the 18th century, a period of peace allowed for new prosperity, and a spate of construction and renovation. The majority of structures still visible at the site today date from this period. The entrance gate of the abbey was given a statuary niche that held an image of the Virgin Mary. The abbey's tower, built under the direction of the architect Jean-Fran√ßois Wincqz, was constructed in a pure Neoclassical style. The carriage house, with five stalls and a dovecote in the center, is unique. The monumental staircase evokes the garden of a palace more than a monastery. = Dissolution of the Abbey = The abbey was still prosperous in 1782, at which time it had 58 monks. But in 1783, Holy Roman Emperor Joseph II, the so-called enlightened despot, classified Cambron Abbey as one of the useless monasteries and convents. It was therefore dissolved. The decision took effect in 1789. On May 27, 1789, the monks were expelled from the abbey and went into exile in the Netherlands. The waning of Austrian power, hastened by the Brabant Revolution, and the establishment of the short- lived unified Belgian states, allowed the monks to return to the abbey for a time beginning in December 1789. Most of the buildings had already been looted. The subsequent French occupation would put an end to nine centuries of Cistercian life. Expelled by the Revolutionary government, the monks left the abbey for good in 1797. The 44th and final abbot of Cambron, Florent P√©pin, died in the Netherlands on November 16, 1795. The abbey's assets were sold and the buildings torn down by the succeeding owners. Elements of the abbey interiors are displayed in the Attre Castle along with the columns from the rood screen which have been re-erected along the castle's former entrance avenue. The abbey was later sold to the Counts of Val de Beaulieu, who built a large ch√¢teau on the site and whose property it remained until 1993. It was then sold to the Domb family, who set up a zoo here, the present Pairi Daiza. In 1982 it was declared a protected area.  Site and buildings  Of the abbey buildings there still remain the tower of the abbey church of 1774, a monumental staircase of 1776, the entire medieval precinct wall and a 13th- century cellar that was formerly beneath the now-vanished lay brothers' quarters, measuring 12 metres by 18 metres with twelve pointed vaults, the main abbey gateway of 1722 and the former abbey farm with an 18th-century coach house. Remains of the former abbey church are kept in Attre Castle. In Bermeries near Bavay in France a grange of Cambron is still extant. Others of the monastery's farms remain at Diksmuide, Rosi√®re, Thiennes, Horrues, Wodecq, Rebais, Lombise and Stoppeldijk.

Tim Blacksmith and Danny D. were signed as executive producers of \\"Roc Me Out\\".  Composition and lyrical interpretation  \\"Roc Me Out\\" is a synth-pop song that runs for 3 minutes and 29 seconds. It is set in \\"chugging\\" tempo and features heavy synths, contagious hooks and West Indian nuances. According to the digital sheet music published by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, \\"Roc Me Out\\" is written in the key of E minor (recorded in D-sharp minor) and set in common time with a tempo of 87 beats per minute.http://www.spotontrack.com/track/roc- me-out/160549 Rihanna's vocal range spans from the low note of B3 to the high note of D5. Music critics noted similarities between the song and previous singles by Rihanna and Australian-British band Pendulum, whose members Swire and McGrillen co-wrote and co-produced the song. Laurence Green of MusicOMH described \\"Roc Me Out\\" as a \\"collision\\" between Rihanna's 2010 single \\"Rude Boy\\" and Pendulum's \\"Slam\\" (Hold Your Colour, 2005). According to Edward Keeble of Gigwise, \\"Roc Me Out\\" sounds like a combination of \\"Umbrella\\" (Good Girl Gone Bad, 2007) and a slowed down version of \\"Slam\\". Lyrically, the song shows Rihanna sexually seducing her love interest, while revealing her \\"nasty secrets\\". According to Julianne Shepherd of Spin, Rihanna \\"coyly dares\\" 'her lover to \\"sex her up\\"'. In \\"Roc Me Out\\", Rihanna uses her \\"militaristic alternate persona\\" and interprets the lyrics \\"with a command and directness befitting\\" of it. Rihanna complains to her lover throughout the lines \\"You‚Äôre taking too long to get my head on the ground / And my feet in the clouds,\\" before cooing, \\"I‚Äôve been a bad girl, daddy\\". She gives him instructions while singing \\"Get my head on the ground and my feet in the clouds\\". Priya Elan of NME commented that the song sounds like a \\"‚ÄòRude Boy‚Äô re-tool from the vocal delivery to her 'Come on boy' line.\\" In the end, Rihanna reveals the \\"dirtiest secret\\" through the line \\"I‚Äôll let you in on a dirty secret, I just want to be loved\\". David Amidon of PopMatters described the line as the song's \\"not exactly a dangerous sentiment\\".  Critical reception  Gigwise's Edward Keeble stated that the influence of co-producer Rob Swire (pictured) of Pendulum is evident all over \\"Roc Me Out\\". Michael Jepson from The Fourth Estate concluded that \\"Roc Me Out\\", along with \\"Cockiness (Love It)\\" and \\"Do Ya Thang\\", are the top candidates of the album's \\"highlights\\". He described the songs are \\"blatantly raunchy\\" and noted their similarities to Rihanna's 2011 single, \\"S&M;\\". Jepson also called \\"Roc Me Out\\" one of the \\"sexiest\\" songs on the album as it \\"shocks the audience\\" with its lyrics. Andy Kelman of Allmusic called the song \\"prowling\\" and further explained that it contains \\"more sleek menace than Rated R‚Äôs 'G4L' and Loud‚Äôs 'S&M;'.\\" Sam Lansky from MTV Buzzworthy wrote that \\"Roc Me Out\\" sounds \\"aggressive and a little ominous\\", and \\"it wouldn't have sounded out of place on Rated R\\". Julianne Shepherd from Spin stated that from another artist, it would be a song about self-doubt, but from Rihanna, \\"it's like she's willfully withholding faith and throwing it back just to tantalize.\\" In a review of Talk That Talk, Giovanny Caquias of CultureBlues placed the song in a \\"slut-core quartet\\" alongside \\"Cockiness (Love It)\\", \\"Birthday Cake\\" and \\"Watch n' Learn\\". He explained that \\"Roc Me Out\\" \\"is more developed than the others, but still much too mediocre to become Rihanna's twelfth number-one single.\\" Reem Buhazza of The National wrote that \\"Roc Me Out\\" together with \\"You da One\\" and \\"Talk That Talk\\" are \\"the winning combination of made-for-radio pop sensibility\\". Laurence Green from MusicOMH labeled the track as \\"a surprising late-album standout\\". Edward Keeble from Gigwise called \\"Roc Me Out a \\"vibrant track\\" and concluded that the co-production by Rob Swire of Pendulum is \\"evident on all facets of it\\". Tuyet Nguyen of The A.V. Club criticized the song by describing it as \\"almost laughable\\". However, he also explained that \\"Rihanna is a performer, not a songwriter\\", and what she sings is \\"less relevant than what she sells: a provocation that is enough to seem empowering, but not so radical that it‚Äôs alienating.\\" Maz Halima from Flavour Magazine was unfavorable of the song in her album review of Talk That Talk, stating that when she heard it, she was \\"a bit [pissed] off\\" because of its similar sound to Rihanna's single \\"Rude Boy\\".

It was written by Priscilla Renea, Chauncey Hollis, Rihanna and Alja Jackson. The production was done by Hollis under his stage-name Hit-Boy. When Renea came with an idea and concept for the song, Hollis had already started working on the composition, without having in mind any particular artist. With the work on the track being finished, it was forwarded to Rihanna and her label, which eagerly accepted it. \\"Watch n' Learn\\" is a dancehall song with prominent reggae characteristics. The song's instrumentation uses finger-snapping, percussions, background clicks, synths and \\"island-flavored\\" drum beat. Lyrically, it is about a woman who teaches her partner how to love her in the right way, throughout which she uses sexual references. \\"Watch n' Learn\\" received predominantly positive reviews from music critics, with many of them praising its composition and sound. Upon the release of Talk That Talk, the song debuted at number 80 on the singles chart in South Korea.  Background and development  One of the recording locations of the song were Roc the Mic Studios in New York City (pictured). \\"Watch n' Learn\\" was written by Priscilla Renea, Chauncey Hollis, Rihanna and Alja Jackson. The production of the song was helmed by Hollis under his stage-name Hit-Boy. Hollis had previously worked with music artists like Lil Wayne, The Throne, Eminem and Jennifer Lopez. \\"Watch n' Learn\\" wasn't originally meant for any particular artist when Hit-Boy started to work on it. In an interview with Jocelyn Vena from MTV News he explained: \\"I was at the studio with this amazing [songwriter] Priscilla Renea, and I was going to tell her to go home, but I was like, 'Stay here and see if you could come up with an idea for this [the song]'\\". Renea previously penned Rihanna's 2011 single \\"California King Bed\\" (Loud, 2010). Hollis further explained that by the time he left the studio and came home, Renea already sent him the idea and concept for the song through IChat. He was eventually satisfied with it and sent the song to Rihanna, in which her team \\"went crazy\\" when they heard it. Rihanna then recorded the song for inclusion on her sixth studio album Talk That Talk (2011). In the same interview for the publication, Hollis explained the title of the song: \\"It's called 'Watch n' Learn,' and people will understand what it's about once it comes out. It's a very sexy record, but it's fun. It's [got] great melodies; it's catchy; the beat knocks. It's so many different elements to it.\\" When asked how is he satisfied with Rihanna's vocals and his prediction on the song he further stated: \\"She definitely murdered it vocally. I was just at the studio last week listening to a mix of it, and man, she killed it. I really feel like, this song, it's going to be big. I'm really excited about it.\\" \\"Watch n' Learn\\" was recorded at Roc the Mic Studios in New York City and at Sofitel Paris Le Faubourg in Paris. The song was mixed by Marcos Tovar. Its vocal production was completed by Kuk Harrell and assisted by TT. and Jennifer Rosales.  Composition  \\"Watch n' Learn\\" is a dancehall song with prominent reggae characteristics that runs for 3 minutes and 31 seconds. It begins with a reggae drum fill that according to Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly originates from Bob Marley's 1983 single \\"Buffalo Soldier\\" (Confrontation, 1983). \\"Watch n' Learn\\" uses finger-snapping, percussions, background clicks, \\"swirling/swelling\\" synths and \\"island-flavored\\" drum beat. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard complimented the balance between the synths and percussion while calling it \\"taut and engaging\\". Flavour Magazine's Maz Halima thought that the beat sounds futuristic and reminds her of a new version of an old beat that was predominantly used in the songs performed by rapper Kanye West. Edward Keeble from Gigwise wrote that \\"Watch n' Learn\\" cares influence from the works by American hip hop and R&B; band TLC, as well as sounds like a \\"call back to the\\" synthpop group Art of Noise. Lyrically, the song is about a woman who teaches her partner how to love her in the right way, throughout which she uses sexual references. MTV News' Jocelyn Vena concluded that song has \\"sassy\\" lyrics, but its melody is soft enough and makes you forget that \\"the track is actually kind of dirty\\". Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound stated that during the interpretation of the lyrics, Rihanna is proud and sexual and her confidence comes from elsewhere. Rihanna reveals her sex fantasies through singing the lyrics: \\"I'mma do it do it do it/On the bed on the floor on the couch/Only cause your lips say make it to my mouth/Just because I can't kiss back/Doesn't mean you can't kiss that\\", which were described as the \\"nastiest\\" on the song by Brad Wete of Complex. As the song continues further, Rihanna is \\"not-so-subtly\\" instructing her lover within the lines \\"It‚Äôs your turn now / Watch and learn now / Watch and learn how / If you learn how / I'll stay\\".  Critical reception  Jon Caramanica from The New York Times linked \\"Watch n' Learn\\" to Beyonc√©'s 2011 single \\"Party\\" Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound called \\"Watch n' Learn\\" a \\"reggae jam\\" and further concluded that \\"low-key Rihanna, without heaps of easily identifiable help or loads of over-saturated gimmicks, is still a knockout\\". Matthew Horton of Virgin Media called the song a \\"wonderfully sunny tribal disco\\" track with a thematics regarding oral sex. In a review of Talk That Talk, Mesfin Fekadu of The Boston Globe stated that Rihanna is \\"raunchy\\" on the new album and it works. Regarding the song he further commented that she's [Rihanna] schooling her man in the bedroom on the fun \\"Watch N' Learn.\\". Giovanny Caquais of CultureBlues concluded that the track \\"strips away\\" from the techno and David Guetta influences which according to him the album is \\"drowning in\\". He further thought that \\"sassy women will absolutely love to sing [the song] in their cars.\\" Maz Hallima of Flavour Magazine positively reviewed \\"Watch n' Learn\\", considering her favorite song from the album together with \\"Cockiness (Love It)\\" and \\"You da One\\". Hallima thought that the song has Rihanna's signature sound and wrote she \\"really enjoyed the contrast between the light beat and her husky voice ‚Äì pure catchiness.\\" Glenn Gamboa of Newsweek considered \\"Watch n' Learn\\" an \\"answer to Janet Jackson's \\"Doesn't Really Matter\\" for its similar production and \\"playful\\" nature. Los Angeles Times‚Äô Randal Roberts while reviewing the song stated: Rihanna \\"reels off her carnal intentions with an impressive though not entirely believable candor.\\" Julianne Shepherd of Spin called the track Rihanna's game in which there is a very little chance for winning ‚Äî \\"but she'd love it if you tried\\". Andy Kellman of Allmusic commended the melody of the song and noted that \\"Watch n' Learn\\" is more unique than Hit-Boy's work on Kanye West and Jay-Z's 2011 single \\"Niggas in Paris\\" (Watch the Throne, 2011). Chelsea Lewis from The Celebrity Cafe concluded that Rihanna \\"is expressing her independence as a woman in the music industry, as she is making a statement with 'Watch n‚Äô Learn' and Talk That Talk as a whole.\\" Herald Sun's Cameron Adams while comparing the song with the other sexual themes on the album, stated that \\"Watch n' Learn\\" is \\"at least instructional\\". Jon Caramanica from The New York Times linked \\"Watch N' Learn\\" to Beyonc√© Knowles' \\"Party\\", however he concluded that even though it has \\"good mouth feel but no taste\\".

It was written by Terius Nash and Rihanna herself, with production helmed by Nash under his stage-name The-Dream. \\"Do Ya Thang\\" is an R&B; song with prominent influences of music from the 1980s. The song uses \\"catchy\\" drum breaks, synths and \\"funky\\" and \\"subtle\\" hook. Lyrically, it is a complimentary love track that contains \\"curse\\" words and a repetitive chorus. \\"Do Ya Thang\\" received predominantly positive reviews from music critics, with many of them praising its composition and sound, while also linking it to Rihanna's previous works from her first studio album Music of the Sun (2005). Upon the release of Talk That Talk, the song debuted on the lower regions of the singles charts in South Korea and the United Kingdom; at number 80 and 136 respectively. It also debuted on the UK R&B; Chart at number 38.  Production and recording  \\"Do Ya Thang\\" was written by The-Dream and Rihanna. The-Dream produced the song. He also co-wrote two more songs on the album: its fourth single \\"Birthday Cake\\" and \\"Red Lipstick\\", with the latter also being featured on the deluxe edition of Talk That Talk (2011). Rihanna recorded \\"Do Ya Thang\\" at several recording studios during her worldwide Loud Tour (2011), including Pelican Hill, in Newport Coast, California and Studio De La Grande Arm√©e in Paris, France. The song was mixed by Manny Marroquin while Erik Madrid and Chris Galland served as mixing assistants. The vocal production of \\"Do Ya Thang\\" was completed by Kuk Harrell and assisted by Jennifer Rosales.  Composition  \\"Do Ya Thang\\" is an R&B; song with prominent influences of music from the 1980s. The song has a length of 3 minutes and 44 seconds. Shaun Kitchener of Entertainmentwise.com described the song as a \\"hip hop flavoured pop treat\\". \\"Do Ya Thang\\" uses \\"catchy\\" drum breaks, synths, \\"funky\\" and \\"subtle\\" hook that, according Gigwise's Edward Keeble, can be found on Rihanna's 2007 single \\"Umbrella\\" (Good Girl Gone Bad, 2007), which was also co-written by Nash. Keeble further called the song a \\"modern classic\\". Emily Exton of Popdust noted the song's resemblance with the album's second single \\"You da One\\", \\"recorded over a loud '80s synth\\". Lyrically, \\"Do Ya Thang\\" is a complimentary love song that contains \\"curse\\" words and a repetitive chorus. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy wrote that the song has a simple message evident in the lyrics, \\"At the end of the day you are who you are and I love you that way.\\" Maz Halima of Flavour Magazine described the track as a \\"serene song\\". \\"Do Ya Thang\\" contains the line \\"And you my lover / But I love you like a brother\\" which, according to Popdust's Exton, is reminiscent of actress Angelina Jolie and her brother James Haven at the Oscars. Exton further explained that the song is full with vague descriptions of Rihanna's feelings, which result as \\"hollow\\" declaration that she is never going away. While singing the lines \\"Middle of the Day / Give Me What I want / It feels so special / It feels so good\\" she admits \\"liking afternoon delights\\".  Critical reception  According to Maz Hallima of Flavour Magazine, \\"Do Ya Thang\\" has a very \\"teenager-ish vibe\\" which according to her works well, however she is aware why Rihanna kept it as a bonus track of the album. Sam Lansky of MTV Buzzworthy wrote that the song \\"can't be beat for sheer likability\\". He further noted that Rihanna is stepping back from her \\"hypersexual persona to sing a more earnest, good-natured tune\\". Michael Jepson of The Fourth State concluded that \\"Do Ya Thang\\", together with \\"Cockiness (Love It)\\" and \\"Roc Me Out\\", are the top candidates from Talk That Talk that can be labeled as the album's \\"highlights\\". According to Jepson, all three songs are \\"blatantly raunchy\\" and feel like a follow up to Rihanna's 2011 single \\"S&M;\\" (Loud, 2011).

National Gallery, London. This near-ruined example of glue-size technique is covered by an accumulated layer of surface dirt which cannot be wiped by restorers for fear of severe damage to the pigments. Glue-size is a painting technique in which pigment is bound (sized) to cloth (usually linen) with hide glue, and typically the unvarnished cloth was then fixed to the frame using the same glue. Glue-size is also known as distemper, though the term \\"distemper\\" is applied variously to different techniques. Glue-size was used because hide glue was a popular binding medium in the 15th century, particularly among artists of the Early Netherlandish period, who used it as an inexpensive alternative to oil. Although a large number of works using this medium were produced, few survive today, mainly because of the high perishability of linen cloth and the solubility of hide glue. Well-known and relatively well-preserved ‚Äî though substantially damaged ‚Äî the most notable examples include Quentin Matsys' Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine (c. 1515-25)\\"The Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine \\". National Gallery, London. Retrieved 7 November 2011 and Dirk Bouts' Entombment (c. 1440-55).\\"The Entombment\\". National Gallery, London. Retrieved 7 November 2011. In German the technique is known as T√ºchleinfarben, meaning ‚Äúsmall cloth colours‚Äù, or T√ºchlein, derived from the German words T√ºch and Lein (\\"fabric\\" and \\"flax\\"). Technique A binding agent for pigment was made by boiling animal skin mixed with other organic tissue and applied to linen, itself prepared with a thin layer of glue.Jones, 10 The linen was ground, but sometimes treated, by both the glue and also white chalk, which allowed a surface suitable for underdrawing and a base that would not absorb the final layer's pigment.Campbell, 29 The advantage of using glue as a binder is that the colours render as matte and opaque textures suited to austere or mournful images as opposed to the translucent appearance associated with oil. Many reds and blues bound in glue would have appeared with a brilliance and intensity difficult to achieve with oil. Unfortunately the surviving examples have greatly deteriorated over time, having suffered from colour alteration due to exposure to light. Furthermore, the solubility of glue derived from animal products has meant that the accumulated layers of dirt cannot be removed without damaging the linen or dissolving the pigment. Although it allowed fine linear detail, subtle tonal transition and at times vivid colourisation, by the end of the 15th century the medium, along with egg tempera, had fallen out of favour. Oil painting had become predominant among the artists of the early Northern Renaissance, mainly due to the innovations in oil by Jan van EyckVan Eyck is often mistakenly credited with the invention of oil painting, whereas in fact the tradition in northern Europe goes back to at least the 12th century and Rogier van der Weyden. It can be viewed as a transitional method between works in tempera or oils on wooden panels and oil paintings on canvas, although t√ºchlein co-existed with panel painting until both were supplanted by oil-on-canvas by the end of the 16th century. The technique corresponds with the Spanish sarga, where a thin gesso ground was favoured to create a smooth working surface. Examples Several examples by mid-16th century Dutch artist Pieter Bruegel the Elder have survived. Bruegel's Adoration of the Magi has traces of colour on the back of the canvas, demonstrating that the linen was not prepared with a traditional ground before it was painted; other examples, such as Bouts' The Entombment were simply sized with glue to prevent the paint from bleeding through. Other Netherlandish examples from approximately a century earlier include the Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine by Quentin Matsys c.1515‚Äì25, and The Entombment by Dieric Bouts c.1440‚Äì55 and related works by Bouts including his Annunciation (now in the J. Paul Getty Museum, California), Adoration of the Kings (now in a private collection in Germany) and Presentation (or Resurrection; now in the Norton Simon Museum, Pasadena, California) which may have formed part of a single polyptych.

Tenorio 2011, showing variation in the species. Conus denizi is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails, cone shells or cones.Bouchet, P. (2015). Conus denizi (Afonso & Tenorio, 2011). Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=724691 on 2015-04-01 Like all species within the genus Conus, these cone snails are predatory and venomous. They are capable of \\"stinging\\" humans, therefore live ones should be handled carefully or not at all. Description The shell is very small, and it is one of the smallest of the endemic species found in the Cape Verde Islands. General profile is ventricosely conical, somewhat elongated with a rounded shoulder. Spire moderate, straight to slightly convex with 4-5 well defined cords on the flat to slightly convex sutural ramps. Sides of the last whorl are straight or slightly convex. Body whorl is smooth except for 8-10 spiral grooves that occupy almost the entire anterior third of the body whorl. Spire is predominantly white with alternating dark brown axial blotches. Last whorl is olive-green to light olive-green, normally with 3 interrupted spiral bands formed by well-defined white blotches occasionally arranged in zigzag or chevron shaped) tinged with brown to dark brown markings. Tip of anterior portion of last whorl is tinged with brown to very dark brown. Aperture is purplish-brown in fresh specimens with 2 distinct whitish bands: one located near mid-body and another, not so evident, just below the shoulder. Inner lip has a yellowish colour. Periostracum is thin, yellow, smooth and translucent. Distribution The species is found on Praia Grande, on the northeast coast of S√£o Vicente Island, Cape Verde.

The German- speaking part of Switzerland (, , , ) comprises about 65 percent of Switzerland (North Western Switzerland, Eastern Switzerland, Central Switzerland, most of the Swiss Plateau and the greater part of the Swiss Alps). The variety of the German language spoken in Switzerland is called Swiss German which refers to any of the Alemannic dialects and which are divided into Low, High and Highest Alemannic. The only exception within German-speaking Switzerland is the municipality of Samnaun where an Austro- Bavarian dialect is spoken. German is the sole official language in 17 Swiss cantons (Aargau, Appenzell Ausserrhoden, Appenzell Innerrhoden, Basel-Stadt, Basel-Landschaft, Glarus, Lucerne, Nidwalden, Obwalden, Schaffhausen, Schwyz, Solothurn, St. Gallen, Thurgau, Uri, Zug, and Zurich). French and German are co-official in 3 cantons (Bern, Fribourg, and Valais). In the trilingual canton of Graub√ºnden, more than half the population speaks German, while most of the rest speak one of the other official languages, Romansh and Italian. While the French-speaking Swiss prefer to call themselves Romands and their part of the country la Romandie, the German-speaking Swiss used to refer to (and, colloquially, still do) the French-speaking Swiss as \\"Welsche\\", and to their area as Welschland, which has the same etymology as the English Welsh (see Walha). In Germany Welsch and Welschland refer to Italy; there, the term is antiquated, rarely used, and somewhat disparaging. By the Middle Ages, a marked difference had developed between the rural cantons of the German- speaking part of Switzerland and the city cantons, divided by views about trade and commerce. After the Reformation, all cantons were either Catholic or Protestant, and the denominational influences on culture added to the differences. Even today, where all cantons are somewhat denominationally mixed, the different historical denominations can be seen in the mountain villages, where Roman Catholic Central Switzerland abounds with chapels and statues of saints, and the farm houses in the very similar landscape of the Protestant Bernese Oberland show Bible verses carved on the housefronts, instead.

Its neighboring towns include Mount Vernon and Burlington. Local historians have speculated that Avon is named after Stratford-upon-Avon. The Avon area was developed as a waterfront town and logging and docking area on the West side of the Skagit River. The place of the original waterfront area is East of Bennett road and South of Avon St. Before 1879, two log jams East of Mount Vernon blocked the Skagit River further West. Along the docking area, Western Red cedar were cut down, harvested for shingle bolts. After the logging, the land was cleared and Avon became a town. Early homesteaders of the area were Thomas McCain in 1876 and Charles Conrad in 1881. Arthur Henry Skaling opened a store Oct 27, 1883 on land he purchased from W.H. Miller who had settled there the year before. According to early resident Ada Hall, W.H. Miller settled this property in 1874 and built the first house there. Soon Avon had a shingle mill, a post office, a boat builder, several stores, an implement company, a newspaper (The Avon Record), a restaurant, a hotel, a barber shop, stage line and two milliners. Methodists organized a church in 1884, and built the present building dates to 1887 with Rev. Moore giving the dedicatory service.Willis, pg.188 Rev. Vroman was the first regular preacher.Hall, pg.6 The church was originally much closer to the river on the Eastern section of what is now called Avon St. It was moved around 1920 to its present location.Willis, pg.73 By 1889 the population reached 500.Hall, pg.10 The Avon school was at the SW corner of Avon Allen road and Bennett road. It was built in 1892Willis, pg.181 and the gymnasium structure is still there. There was also an IOOF Hall built in 1891Willis, pg.191 and stood at the SE corner of the town, which is now where Bennett road makes a curve to the West.Dodd, pg.1 map This building is no longer there. In 1906, the Avon Post Office was closed and transferred to Mount Vernon.Willis, pg.203 After the flooding of 1909 many of the waterfront buildings were moved away from the river to be protected by the newly constructed dike. As the importance of waterways for transportation and industry decreased, and the use of rail and autos increased, the waterfront town of Avon slowly ceased to be a town and became a quiet residential community. Most of the original buildings are no longer there except for a few homes built before 1900, the school gymnasium, and the Methodist church.

The scandal broke in early November 2011 when Sandusky was indicted on 52 counts of child molestation, stemming from incidents that occurred between 1994 and 2009. Sandusky was ultimately convicted on 45 counts of child sexual abuse on June 22, 2012, and was sentenced to a minimum of 30 years and a maximum of 60 years in prison. Additionally, three Penn State officials school president Graham Spanier, vice president Gary Schultz and athletic director Tim Curley were charged with perjury, obstruction of justice, failure to report suspected child abuse, and related charges. The Penn State Board of Trustees commissioned an independent investigation by former FBI Director Louis Freeh, whose report stated that Penn State's longtime head football coach Joe Paterno, along with Spanier, Curley and Schultz, had known about allegations of child abuse by Sandusky as early as 1998, had shown \\"total and consistent disregard...for the safety and welfare of Sandusky's child victims\\", and \\"empowered\\" Sandusky to continue his acts of abuse by failing to disclose them. Shortly after the scandal broke, Spanier resigned. The Board of Trustees terminated the contracts of Paterno and Curley. As a result of the scandal, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) imposed sanctions on the Penn State football program: a $60 million fine, a four-year postseason ban, scholarship reductions, and a vacation of all victories from 1998 to 2011. These sanctions were considered to be among the most severe ever imposed on an NCAA member school. NCAA President Mark Emmert stated that the sanctions were levied \\"not to be just punitive, but to make sure the university establishes an athletic culture and daily mindset in which football will never again be placed ahead of educating, nurturing and protecting young people.\\" The Big Ten Conference subsequently imposed an additional $13 million fine. The Paterno family retained former Attorney General Richard Thornburgh to conduct a review of the Freeh report, which concluded that the report constituted a \\"rush to injustice\\" that could not be relied upon and that Freeh's evidence fell \\"far short\\" of showing that Joe Paterno attempted to conceal the scandal, but rather that \\"the contrary is true\\". In January 2013, state senator Jake Corman and state treasurer Rob McCord sued the NCAA, seeking to overturn the Penn State sanctions on the basis that Freeh had been actively collaborating with the organization and that due process had not been followed. In November 2014, Corman released emails showing \\"regular and substantive\\" contact between Freeh's investigators and the NCAA, suggesting that Freeh's conclusions were orchestrated. As part of a settlement, the NCAA restored the 111 wins to Paterno's record on January 16, 2015. On March 25, 2017, Curley, Schultz, and Spanier pleaded or were found guilty of misdemeanor charges of child endangerment. All conspiracy charges against Curley and Schultz were dropped, and Spanier was acquitted of conspiracy, the charges central to Louis Freeh's allegation of a cover-up. In June 2017, all three were sentenced to jail terms, fines, and probation for the misdemeanors. Spanier was sentenced to four to twelve months in jail, a $7,500 fine, and two years of probation. Spanier's misdemeanor conviction was subsequently overturned on appeal. Background Jerry Sandusky was an assistant coach for the Penn State Nittany Lions football team from 1969 to 1999. For the last 23 of those years, Sandusky was the team's defensive coordinator. In 1977, he founded The Second Mile in State College, Pennsylvania, a charity formed to help disadvantaged youth. Sandusky retired from the organization in 2010. In 1998, he was investigated for child sexual abuse but no charges were filed. Sandusky was considered for spearheading the startup of a football program at Penn State Altoona in 1998‚Äì99, but the idea was scrapped and he retired in 1999. After his retirement, Sandusky remained a coach emeritus with an office in and access to Penn State's football facilities per his employment contract. Criminal prosecutions = Investigation = In Pennsylvania, the purpose of a grand jury is to recommend charges. The grand jury hears cases in full but does not have the authority to indict. In the case of Sandusky, the grand jury investigation began in 2009 under state attorney general and later-governor Tom Corbett. The grand jury subpoenaed records from both Penn State and The Second Mile, and heard testimony from Victim 1 (Aaron Fisher), Mike McQueary, Joe Paterno, Tim Curley, Gary Schultz, Victim 7, Graham Spanier, Victim 4, and Ronald Petrosky (Penn State janitor). This grand jury did not recommend indictment. State attorney general Linda L. Kelly prepared a presentment which included credibility determinations about the testimonies received before the first grand jury for the second grand jury. This second grand jury heard testimony from Victim 3, Victim 5, and Victim 6. Kelly said that during the investigation there was an \\"uncooperative atmosphere\\" from some Penn State officials.  Victim 1  The investigation was initiated in the spring of 2008 after Aaron Fisher (identified in court papers as \\"Victim 1\\"), then a freshman at Central Mountain High School in Mill Hall, Pennsylvania, reported that Sandusky had been molesting him since age 12. Fisher met Sandusky through The Second Mile in the mid-2000s, when Sandusky began making advances toward Fisher which involved \\"inappropriate touching\\". At the time of the alleged actions, Sandusky was volunteering as an assistant football coach at Central Mountain High School, where these assaults took place.  Victim 2  Mike McQueary, then a graduate assistant and later assistant coach at Penn State, testified that on approximately February 9, 2001, he had been inside the Lasch Football Building, located on Penn State's University Park campus, when he witnessed a naked Sandusky standing directly behind a boy whose hands were up on the wall in the men's shower room. McQueary, distraught, left the building and called his father John, who told Mike to come over to his house right away and talk to him. While Mike was on the way to his father's, John called Dr. Jonathan Dranov, his boss and family friend, seeking his advice. As President of Centre Medical and Surgical Associates, Dranov was a mandated reporter in the state of Pennsylvania. Dranov testified that he questioned Mike three times about what he saw, and each time Mike kept going back to what he witnessed. Because there was no clear crime witnessed by Mike, Dranov and John recommended he talk to head football coach Joe Paterno. On Saturday morning, Mike McQueary called Paterno to arrange a meeting, and the two met at Paterno's home later that same morning. McQueary testified he gave a rough report of what he had seen but that, out of respect, he did not share more graphic details. Paterno left for Pittsburgh to attend an awards ceremony shortly after meeting with McQueary and did not return to State College until late Saturday night or Sunday morning. On Sunday morning, Paterno called then- athletic director Tim Curley regarding the incident. Curley, along with then- university vice president Gary Schultz, both went to Paterno's home, where Paterno told them about McQueary's story and advised them to speak directly to McQueary themselves to get the full details. In his grand jury testimony, Paterno said that he was only told about Sandusky \\"fondling or doing something of a sexual nature\\" to the victim. On Monday, Curley and Schultz reported the incident to Graham Spanier, who was president of Penn State at the time. Spanier told them to meet with the graduate assistant, which he was not told to be McQueary. Nine or ten days later (the exact date is unknown), McQueary received a phone call from Curley regarding the incident and set up a meeting with Curley and Schultz in the Bryce Jordan Center, either that same afternoon or the next day, to go over the details of what had happened in the shower room. Curley and Schultz both denied having been told about alleged anal intercourse. Curley denied that McQueary reported anything of a sexual nature whatsoever and described the conduct as merely \\"horsing around\\". Spanier likewise testified that he was only apprised of an incident involving Sandusky and a younger child \\"horsing around in the shower\\". Curley then met with Sandusky and told him he was not to be using Penn State's athletic facilities with any young people, and Curley reported the incident to Jack Raykovitz, who, as the CEO of The Second Mile, was Sandusky's boss and also a mandated reporter. The Second Mile fell under the direct supervision and authority of Pennsylvania's Department of Public Welfare, and was a contractor of the local county office of Children and Youth Services. Raykovitz was also a highly trained professional on handling such allegations. He reported the incident to two board members of The Second Mile, Bruce Heim and Bob Poole, and told Sandusky to wear shorts in the shower in the future. Despite Penn State banning Sandusky from bringing boys onto the main campus after the McQueary incident, he was allowed to operate a summer camp through his Sandusky Associates company from 2002 to 2008 at Penn State's Behrend satellite campus near Erie, where he had daily contact with boys from fourth grade to high school. Other victims  One child's mother reported a 1998 incident to Penn State police when her son came home with his hair wet. After an investigation by Detective Ronald Shreffler, Centre County District Attorney Ray Gricar chose not to prosecute. Shreffler testified before the grand jury that the director of the campus police then told him to drop the case, and that detectives had eavesdropped on conversations during which the mother confronted Sandusky about the incident. Sandusky admitted to showering with other boys and refused to discontinue the practice. Gricar was not available to testify, as he had disappeared in 2005. Victims also commonly reported that Sandusky would place his hand on their thighs or inside the waistband of their underpants. Two recounted oral sex with Sandusky, sometimes culminating in his ejaculation. Penn State janitor James Calhoun reportedly observed Sandusky performing oral sex on an unidentified boy in 2000, but by the time of Sandusky's trial he was in a nursing home suffering from dementia; he was deemed not competent to testify.  Locations of assaults  According to the grand jury testimony, the assaults took place: * In Sandusky's basement, * At a victim's high school, * In Sandusky's car, * In the Lasch Football Building on Penn State's University Park campus, * Toftrees Golf Resort and Conference Center, * The East Area Locker Rooms on the Penn State campus, and * A hotel room in Texas. At least twenty of the incidents were said to have taken place while Sandusky was still employed by Penn State. Illustration of victims, people with alleged knowledge of alleged crimes, and official responses as of November 11, 2011 = Indictments = On November 4, 2011, state attorney general Linda L. Kelly indicted Sandusky on forty counts of sex crimes against young boys following a three-year investigation. Sandusky was arrested on November 5 and charged with seven counts of involuntary deviant sexual intercourse, as well as eight counts of corruption of minors, eight counts of endangering the welfare of a child, seven counts of indecent assault, and other offenses. Penn State officially banned Sandusky from campus on November 6. He was arrested again at his residence on December 7, 2011, on additional charges of sexual abuse. Schultz and Curley, who had been found to be not credible by the grand jury, were charged with perjury and failure to report suspected child abuse. The indictment accused Curley and Schultz of not only failing to tell the police, but falsely telling the grand jury that McQueary never informed them of sexual activity. Sandusky was then released on $250,000 bail pending trial. Curley and Schultz appeared in a Harrisburg courtroom on November 7, where a judge set bail at $75,000 and required them to surrender their passports. Curley was placed on administrative leave, and Schultz resigned to go back into retirement. Spanier was criticized for issuing a statement expressing support for Curley and Schultz, while failing to express any concern for Sandusky's alleged victims. Congressman Pat Meehan asked Education Secretary Arne Duncan to probe whether Penn State violated the Clery Act when it failed to report Sandusky's alleged actions on campus. Duncan announced an investigation into possible Clery Act violations at Penn State, saying that colleges and universities have \\"a legal and moral responsibility to protect children\\", and that Penn State's failure to report the alleged abuse would be a \\"tragedy\\". Officials in San Antonio, Texas also began investigating whether Sandusky molested one of the victims at the 1999 Alamo Bowl. On February 24, 2012, the Harrisburg Patriot-News reported that U.S. Attorney Peter J. Smith was conducting a federal criminal investigation into Penn State separate from the Clery Act investigation in which he subpoenaed the school for information about Spanier, Sandusky, Curley, Schultz and The Second Mile. Specifically, Smith subpoenaed information about Sandusky's travel records in relation to allegations that he had molested boys at both the 1999 Alamo Bowl in San Antonio and the 1999 Outback Bowl in Tampa, Florida. Although federal authorities would have jurisdiction in the case since Sandusky was accused of taking the boys across state lines, three former prosecutors interviewed by the Patriot-News believed that this investigation did not appear to be focusing on Sandusky, but instead on a possible coverup by school officials. = Commonwealth v. Sandusky =  Trial  During Sandusky's trial, an accuser and Sandusky's wife Dottie both testified about the Alamo Bowl incident. The accuser said Sandusky was attempting to negotiate oral sex with him in a bathroom while Dottie was in the apartment, and that she came to the \\"edge\\" of the bathroom for a few words with Sandusky including, \\"What are you doing in there?\\" Dottie said Sandusky was having a disagreement, including yelling, with the boy ‚Äî whom she said was in the bathroom, but \\"clothed\\" ‚Äî about attending a luncheon. She went on to characterize the boy as \\"very demanding. ... And he was very conniving. And he wanted his way, and he didn't listen a whole lot.\\" Dottie testified when it was still uncertain whether Sandusky would testify. Though Sandusky's defense attorney Joe Amendola had said on the opening day of the trial that he would testify, Amendola ultimately rested the case without calling Sandusky to testify in his own defense.  Verdict  On the evening of June 22, 2012, the jury found Sandusky guilty on 45 of the 48 counts against him. Following the announcement of the verdict, Judge John Cleland immediately revoked Sandusky's bail and ordered him to be taken into custody to await sentencing. Sandusky continued to maintain his innocence even after being convicted. His attorneys filed a notice to appeal the conviction.  Sentencing  Sandusky faced a maximum sentence of 442 years in prison. According to NBC News, he likely faced a minimum sentence of 60 years ‚Äì at his age, effectively a life sentence. Sentencing was scheduled for October 9, 2012. At that hearing, prosecutors requested to the court that Sandusky be declared a sexually violent predator under Pennsylvania's version of Megan's Law, which would subject him to stringent reporting requirements if he is released. He would not only have to report his address to police every three months for the rest of his life, but would also have to participate in a court-approved counseling program. However, this designation would likely be symbolic since Sandusky will almost certainly die in prison. Earlier, on August 30, the Pennsylvania Sexual Offenders Assessment Board recommended that Sandusky be declared a sexually violent predator.+ On the day of sentencing, Sandusky was officially designated a sexually violent predator. He was sentenced on October 9, 2012, to a minimum of 30 years and a maximum of 60 years in prison. Judge Cleland stated that he intentionally avoided a sentence with a large number of years, saying it would be \\"too abstract\\" and also said to Sandusky that the sentence he handed down had the \\"unmistakable impact of saying 'the rest of your life'.\\" = Commonwealth v. Curley, Schultz, and Spanier = On November 1, 2012, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and NBC News, citing sources close to the investigation, reported that Spanier would be formally charged for his alleged role related to Sandusky's crimes. Later that day, Kelly announced that as part of a superseding indictment, Spanier, Curley and Schultz had been charged with grand jury perjury, child endangerment, conspiracy, obstruction of justice in connection with the scandal. Spanier faced eight charges, three of which were felonies. A criminal docket was filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Preliminary hearings for Curley and Schultz were held on December 16, 2011. Prosecution presented several witnesses. McQueary took the stand again and testified that, on the night of the 2001 incident, he saw a 10- to 12-year-old Caucasian boy standing upright in the shower, facing the wall, and Sandusky directly behind him, with Sandusky's hands wrapped around the boy's \\"waist or midsection\\". McQueary estimated that the boy was roughly a foot shorter than Sandusky. He further stated that he \\"did not see insertion nor was there any verbiage or protest, screaming or yelling\\" and denied ever using the words \\"anal\\" or \\"rape\\" to describe the incident to anybody. On July 30, 2013, Spanier, Schultz, and Curley were ordered by Judge William Wenner to stand trial. On January 22, 2016, some of the charges against Curley, Schultz, and Spanier were dropped due to the violation of their rights to legal representation. On March 24, 2017, Spanier was found guilty of one charge of child endangerment and not guilty of the second charge of child endangerment or conspiracy. Curley and Schultz had previously pleaded guilty to misdemeanor child endangerment charges and testified at Spanier's trial in exchange for all other charges, including conspiracy, being dropped. On June 2, 2017, Spanier, Schultz and Curley were sentenced to prison by Senior Judge John Boccabella. \\"Why no one made a phone call to the police...is beyond me. Why Mr. Sandusky was allowed to continue to use the Penn State facilities is beyond me,\\" Boccabella said. Spanier was sentenced to four to twelve months with two months in jail and four months house arrest, followed by two years of probation and a $7,500 fine. Spanier's conviction was subsequently overturned on appeal. Curley was sentenced to a seven to 23-month jail term, with four months of it as house arrest, followed by two years of probation and a $5,000 fine. Schultz was sentenced to a six to 23-month jail term also with four months of it as house arrest, followed by two years of probation and a $5,000 fine. Reactions = Media = The Patriot-News was the first media outlet to report on the Sandusky grand jury investigation in March 2011. The story did not receive much attention outside of the immediate area, and many readers at the time assailed the newspaper for impugning the reputations of Sandusky and Penn State. After the charges against Sandusky were filed, the paper was vindicated and, in April 2012, crime reporter Sara Ganim and members of the Patriot-News staff were awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting for their coverage of the scandal. Under Pennsylvania law of the time, any state employee who learned about suspected child abuse was required to report the incident to his immediate supervisor. In the case of the 2002 incident, McQueary reported the incident to his immediate supervisor, Paterno. In turn, Paterno reported the incident to his immediate supervisor, Curley, and also reported it to Schultz, to whom the University Police Department directly reported. For these reasons, Paterno and McQueary were not implicated in any criminal wrongdoing, since they did what they were legally required to do.Joe Paterno hires criminal defense lawyer J. Sedgwick Sellers. ABC News, November 11, 2011.Drehs, Wayne. Coach may have whistle-blower status. ESPN, November 11, 2011. However, once the incident came to light, Paterno was criticized for not going beyond the law to report the incident to police, or at least seeing to it that it was reported. Several advocatesRobert Hoatson and David Clohessy for victims of sexual abuse argued that Paterno should have faced charges for not going to the police himself when it was apparent Penn State officials were unwilling to act. After McQueary was identified as the graduate assistant who reported the 2001 incident, he was criticized for not intervening to protect Sandusky's victim (an accusation McQueary has since disputed), as well as for not reporting the incident to police himself. On November 7, Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said that though some may have fulfilled their legal obligation to report suspected abuse, \\"somebody has to question about what I would consider the moral requirements for a human being that knows of sexual things that are taking place with a child.\\" Noonan added that anyone who knows about suspected abuse, \\"whether you're a football coach or a university president or the guy sweeping the building\\" has \\"a moral responsibility to call us.\\" Paterno said McQueary informed him that \\"he had witnessed an incident in the shower ... but he at no time related to me the very specific actions contained in the Grand Jury report.\\" Paterno was uncertain if being more graphic would have made a difference. \\"And to be frank with you I don't know that it would have done any good, because I never heard of, of, rape and a man,\\" said Paterno. When he read the presentment after it became public, he asked his son, \\"What is sodomy, anyway?\\" Further, following reports of the arrests, criticism of Penn State leadership and Paterno himself included calls for their dismissal for allegedly \\"protecting Penn State's brand instead of a child\\" and allowing Sandusky to retain emeritus status and unfettered access to the university, despite knowledge of the allegations of sexual abuse. In an interview with New York City radio station WFAN, sports reporter Kim Jones, a Penn State alumna, stated that, \\"I can't believe [Paterno's] heart is that black, where he simply never thought about [Sandusky's 2001 incident] again and never thought about those poor kids who were looking for a male mentor, a strong man in their life.\\"\\"Mike'd Up\\", WFAN- AM, November 9, 2011. Former sports commentator Keith Olbermann called for Paterno to be immediately fired, saying that \\"he failed all of the kids‚Äîthe kid kids and the player kids‚Äîhe purported to be protecting.\\" In an editorial for the Centre Daily Times, literary critic Robert Bernard Hass, a Penn State alumnus, compared Paterno's downfall to a Greek tragedy and suggested that despite his many good deeds, pride and age contributed to his failure to report the incident to police. The Patriot-News published a rare full-page, front-page editorial in its November 8, 2011, edition, calling for Spanier's immediate resignation as Penn State president; it also called for this to be Paterno's last season coaching Penn State football. The same day, an editorial in the Post-Gazette called for the resignations of both Paterno and McQueary. On November 14, Sandusky gave his first interview after being arrested. In a phone interview with NBC Sports's Bob Costas on Rock Center with Brian Williams, Sandusky denied the allegations, though he admitted showering with boys and inadvertently touching them \\"without intent of sexual contact\\". The interview received substantial coverage in the media, particularly regarding the manner in which Sandusky answered Costas when asked if he was sexually attracted to young boys: The day of the interview, Sandusky's lawyer claimed that he was able to track down Victim 2 and that, according to the child, the incident did not occur as described by McQueary. However, in the days following the interview, several potential victims contacted State College lawyer Andy Shubin alleging abuse by Sandusky, with one accuser reporting an abusive encounter with Sandusky in the 1970s. The media began to run various accounts of Penn State culture, as well as a powerful \\"cult of personality\\" surrounding Paterno. Former Penn State employees, including a former vice president of student affairs Vickey Tripone, and former football grad assistant Matt Paknis himself a child abuse survivor who admitted he noticed but failed to report Sandusky's behavior stepped forward to critique the influence of the school's football program. Further stories detailed the loss of sponsorships, the damage to Penn State's merchandise sales, brand, student admissions, and the impact of the scandal on recent graduates. On December 3, 2014, KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh reported that Sandusky received a letter from Penn State asking to renew his season ticket plan for the football team and attend a \\"recruiting\\" trip to a Penn State basketball game. The letter was reportedly sent out in error.Penn State Reportedly Sends Jerry Sandusky Letter To Renew Season Tickets KDKA-TV (12/03/2014) = The Second Mile = Jack Raykovitz, the longtime president and CEO of The Second Mile, announced his resignation on November 14. In addition, the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute's Angels in Adoption program subsequently rescinded its earlier 2002 award to Sandusky for his work with The Second Mile \\"in light of the serious allegations against him, and to preserve the integrity of the Angels in Adoption program.\\" = Penn State = The allegations impacted personnel and operations for Penn State. Penn State responded in various ways.  Ousting of Spanier, Curley, Paterno, and Schultz  Penn State President Graham Spanier released a statement of support for Curley and Schultz before being forced to resign. Joe Paterno was heavily criticized for his reaction to the allegations and was subsequently forced to resign in the middle of the 2011 season. On November 8, 2011, Spanier canceled Paterno's weekly Tuesday press conference, citing legal concerns. It was to have been the coach's first public appearance since Sandusky's arrest. Paterno later reported that Spanier canceled the press conference without providing him with an explanation. That same day, The New York Times reported that Penn State was planning Paterno's exit at the close of the 2011 college football season. Based on interviews with two individuals briefed on conversations among top university officials, the Times reported: \\"The Board of Trustees has yet to determine the precise timing of Mr. Paterno's exit, but it is clear that (he) will not coach another season.\\" The following day, Associated Press reported that Paterno had decided to retire at the end of the 2011 season, saying that he didn't want to be a distraction. In a statement announcing his retirement, Paterno said, \\"It is one of the great sorrows of my life. With the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had done more.\\" On the afternoon of November 9, Easton Express-Times reported that the Board had given Spanier an ultimatum‚Äîresign before that night's meeting or be fired. At that night's meeting, Spanier offered his immediate resignation. The Board accepted it and named provost Rodney Erickson as interim president.McGill, Andrew; Assad, Matt; Sheehan, Daniel Patrick (November 10, 2011). \\"Penn State President Graham Spanier Resigns in Wake of Scandal\\". The Morning Call. Retrieved November 11, 2011. Several Penn State sources told StateCollege.com and the Patriot-News that Spanier and vice chairman John Surma mutually agreed that the best way forward for all involved would be for Spanier to resign \\"voluntarily and with grace.\\"Former Penn State president Graham Spanier volunteered to resign, wasn't fired, report says.

At the same meeting, the Board turned down Paterno's proposal to finish out the season and instead stripped him of his coaching duties immediately; defensive coordinator Tom Bradley was named the interim coach for the remainder of the season. During the week after Paterno's firing, the Big Ten Conference removed his name from the championship trophy for its conference championship game, renaming it the Stagg Championship Trophy. The inaugural game was scheduled for December 2011, and the trophy was originally named the Stagg-Paterno Championship Trophy after both Paterno and Amos Alonzo Stagg, a college football pioneer. In addition, the Maxwell Football Club announced that the Joseph V. Paterno Award, presented to the college football coach who did the most to develop his players both on and off the field, would be discontinued. An attorney retained by the families of some of Sandusky's victims criticized the decision by the Board to fire Paterno, saying, \\"The school let the victims down once, and I think they owed it to the victims to at least gauge how the immediate termination decision would impact them as opposed to Mr. Paterno's resignation at the end of the year.\\" However, one of the trustees told Allentown Morning Call that the Board had no choice but to force Paterno to leave immediately to contain the growing outrage over the scandal. According to the trustee, the Board considered letting Paterno finish the season with Bradley as team spokesman, but ultimately decided that would still keep the focus on Paterno. The Board also did not like that Paterno released statements on his own rather than through the school, with some board members feeling he may have breached his contract. The trustee also noted that he and many of his colleagues felt Paterno either \\"knew about [the abuse] and swept it under the rug, or he didn't ask enough questions.\\" The board was also angered by Spanier's statements of support for Curley and Schultz.Kennedy, Sam; McGill, Andrew. Trustee: Media frenzy forced board's hand. The Morning Call, November 10, 2011. A few months later, chairman Steve Garban and vice chairman John Surma issued a statement saying that the board felt Paterno \\"could not be expected to continue to effectively perform his duties\\" in the wake of the scandal. On March 12, the Board of Trustees released what it described as its final statement on the ouster of Spanier and Paterno, stating that Spanier not only made unauthorized statements to the press, but failed to tell the Board all he knew about the 2001 incident. It also said that Paterno demonstrated a \\"failure of leadership\\" by not going to the police. The Board said it had every intention of sending someone to personally inform Paterno of the decision, but was unable to do so because of a large number of people surrounding his house. Rather than risk having Paterno learn about the decision via the media, the Board decided to order him to leave immediately via telephone.Report of the Board of Trustees concerning Nov 9 decisions. Pennsylvania State University Board of Trustees, March 12, 2012. However, in late 2014 and early 2015, court depositions by trustees Kenneth Frazier and Keith Masser conflicted with the \\"failure of leadership\\" story. As stated by Masser in his deposition in state senator Jake Corman's lawsuit against the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), \\"The decision to remove Coach Paterno had nothing to do with what he had known, what he hadn't done. It was based upon the distraction of having him on the sidelines would have caused the university and the current football team harm. It had nothing to do with what Coach Paterno had done, or hadn't done.\\" Frazier's testimony added that, given what had been reported publicly and in the grand jury presentment, he felt that Coach Paterno leading the football team onto the field would not send the right message. It was his opinion that, although the board needed to be careful to understand all the facts, the decision about relieving Paterno of his coaching duties did not depend on knowing the key facts of Paterno's alleged involvement. Rather, given the seriousness of the matter, Frazier's main concern was the public perception of the University's values if Coach Paterno were to remain as coach. Spanier remained a tenured sociology professor at Penn State, despite being stripped of his duties as president.Rogers. Megan. Spanier remains tenured faculty member . The Daily Collegian, November 11, 2011. Likewise, Paterno remained a tenured member of the Penn State faculty, and was treated as having retired. The Board was still finalizing Paterno's retirement package at the time of his death from lung cancer two months later, on January 22, 2012. On October 16, 2012, Penn State announced it would not renew Curley's contract when it expired in June 2013. Freeh report  On November 21, 2011, Frazier announced that Louis Freeh, former director of the FBI, would lead an internal investigation into Penn State's actions. Freeh announced that the team assisting him in his investigation would include former FBI agents and federal prosecutors. As the Sandusky trial proceeded toward conviction in June 2012, it was reported that \\"[t]he university says that [Freeh's] report should be out this summer and will be released to the trustees and the public simultaneously without being reviewed by the school's general counsel's office\\". The Freeh report was released on July 12, 2012. Freeh concluded that Paterno, Spanier, Curley and Schultz were complicit in \\"conceal[ing] Sandusky's activities from the Board of Trustees, the University community and authorities.\\" According to Exhibit 2F of the report, Spanier and Schultz felt that approaching Sandusky as a first step was a more \\"humane\\" approach. Freeh's press release was critical of all four for not expressing the same feeling toward his victim. The report was also critical of Penn State's general counsel, Cynthia Baldwin. Freeh concluded that Schultz, Spanier, Curley and Paterno \\"failed to protect against a child sexual predator harming children for over a decade\\", as well as violated the Clery Act. The report also stated the four men not only made no effort to identify the victim of the 2001 incident, but alerted Sandusky to McQueary's allegations against him, thus potentially putting the victim in more danger. In addition, the report said that the four men \\"exhibited a striking lack of empathy for Sandusky's victims by failing to inquire as to their safety and well-being.\\" The report stated that the men knew about the 1998 incident but \\"empowered Sandusky to attract potential victims to the campus and football events by allowing him to have continued, unrestricted and unsupervised access to the University's facilities and affiliation with the University's prominent football program\\" while the investigation was underway. The report stated that Paterno was asked in January 2011 by the grand jury about inappropriate sexual conduct with young boys, other than the 2001 incident. He replied, \\"I do not know of it. ... I don't know. I don't remember.\\" Spanier had granted Sandusky emeritus status, and the perquisites of that status, upon his retirement in 1999, to the dismay of provost Rodney Erickson and vice provost Robert Secor. In emails dated August 31, 1999, Erickson said, \\"Let's go ahead and grant it [emeritus status], if Graham has already promised it,\\" and Secor wrote, \\"But we are in a bind. Apparently Graham told [Sandusky] that we would do this, he was wholly within his rights here since the policy says, 'The President may grant (or deny) Emeritus Rank on an exception basis.'\\" Freeh found no evidence to show that Sandusky's retirement or emeritus rank was related to the events at the Lasch Building. In response, Penn State's trustees announced that they accepted the report's conclusions and would implement corrective measures. On September 13, 2012, a group of alumni and supporters, under the name of Penn Staters for Responsible Stewardship, released a review of the Freeh report that was critical of their investigation and conclusions. On February 10, 2013, a report commissioned by the Paterno family was released by Richard Thornburgh, former U.S. Attorney General and former governor of Pennsylvania, maintaining that the report was \\"seriously flawed, both with respect to the process of [its] investigation and its findings related to Mr. Paterno\\". In response, Freeh called Thornburgh's report \\"self-serving\\" and said that it did not change the facts and findings of his initial investigation. On June 23, 2014, at Sandusky's pension forfeiture appeal, hearing arbiter Michael Bangs ruled that his pension be reinstated and criticized the Freeh report, stating it \\"was based on significant hearsay and was mostly ruled inadmissible (for the proceedings), [but] was admitted in part to show it had found Sandusky had received 71 separate payments from Penn State between 2000 and 2008\\". Later in a footnote, Bangs states, \\"The terrifically significant disparity between the finding in the Freeh report and the actual truth is disturbing. While the Freeh report found that Penn State had made 71 separate payments to [Sandusky] between 2000‚Äì2008, they were off by almost 85 percent, as the correct number was six separate payments\\". Bangs goes on to say that the error \\"calls into question the accuracy and veracity of the entire report\\". NBC sportscaster Bob Costas said, \\"What Freeh did was not only gather facts but he reached a conclusion which is at least debatable from those facts and then he assigned a motivation, not only to Curley and Schultz and Spanier, but he specifically assigned a very dark motivation to Joe Paterno, which seems like it might be quite a leap. ... A reasonable person will conclude that there is some doubt here and that the other side of the story deserves to be heard.\\" Other actions A building owner removed Sandusky's image from a mural near the university, and the Penn State Creamery renamed an ice cream flavor which had been created in his honor. On top of ousting both Paterno and Spanier, the school also placed McQueary on indefinite paid administrative leave. Steve Garban resigned from the Board of Trustees after the release of the Freeh report, the first member of the Board to do so since the scandal broke.Rubinkam, Michael, \\"Former chairman of Penn State trustees board quits\\".

Fisher withdrew from Central Mountain High School due to bullying, and the boy's mother has stated that the high school did not do enough to prevent the fallout. In January 2012, new university president Rodney Erickson traveled for a week to speak with alumni in New York, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia in an attempt to repair the university's image. At the meetings, Erickson received harsh criticism from alumni over the firing of Joe Paterno, and also received widespread criticism from the media for attempting to shift the focus away from the university. After the Freeh report's release, local organizations called for the removal of the Joe Paterno statue outside Beaver Stadium. A small plane towed a banner over campus, reading Take the Statue Down or We Will. After some days of mixed messages,Thomas, Taylor, \\"Penn State to remove Paterno Statue this weekend\\", MarketWatch, July 20, 2012.

The statue was reportedly put in storage.\\"Penn State removes Paterno statue: reports\\", MarketWatch, July 22, 2012. Retrieved 2012-07-23. Erickson said the statue had become \\"a source of division and an obstacle to healing\\" but made a distinction between it and the Paterno Library, also on campus. The $13 million 1997 library expansion, partially funded by a $4 million gift from Paterno and his wife Sue, \\"remains a tribute to Joe and Sue Paterno's commitment to Penn State's student body and academic success, and it highlights the positive impacts coach Paterno had on the university.... Thus I feel strongly that the library's name should remain unchanged,\\" Erickson said in the statement. Penn State students Downtown State College was the location of the November 9‚Äì10 student protest. A few Penn State students, angered over Spanier's role in the 2001 incident as well as his statement of support for Curley and Schultz, created a Facebook page, \\"Fire Graham Spanier\\", to call on Penn State's Board of Trustees to fire him. An online petition at change.org calling for Spanier's ouster garnered over 1,700 signatures in four days. After Paterno's ouster was announced on live television, students and non-students protested near the Penn State campus. Sources estimate 10,000 people protested to support Paterno, with some tipping over a WTAJ news van. Some police officers used a \\"chemical spray\\" to disperse the demonstrators. Minor injuries were reported. Approximately $200,000 in damage resulted from the protest. Local police criticized the short notice from Penn State administration and the insufficient time to mobilize officers from other areas as factors exacerbating the situation. About 47 people were charged in connection with the protest, and some were subsequently sentenced to a combination of prison terms, probation, community service, and restitution. On November 10, a group of Penn State alumni set up and announced ProudPSUforRAINN, a fundraiser for the anti-sexual violence network RAINN with a goal of $500,000, which was exceeded by July 10, 2012. Students also held a candlelight vigil on the lawn of Old Main. The planning for the vigil began the Monday before Paterno's firing and gained steam quickly across campus. It was shown live on news networks across the country, including CNN and ESPN. Former NFL player and sports broadcaster LaVar Arrington, a Penn State alum, spoke at the event which attracted an estimated 10,000. =NCAA=  Initial sanctions  On November 17, NCAA President Mark Emmert personally wrote Erickson to ask him how Penn State had exercised control over its athletic program in the wake of the scandal. The letter also demanded answers to four specific questions about how Penn State had complied with NCAA policies during that time. Penn State pledged full cooperation, but asked to defer its response until after the release of the Freeh report. On July 16, Emmert appeared on PBS' Tavis Smiley and said that with the release of the Freeh report, Penn State had \\"weeks, not months\\" to answer the questions he'd raised in the November letter. He also hinted that he had not ruled out issuing the so-called \\"death penalty\\", which would have forced Penn State to cancel at least the 2012 season. The NCAA had not handed down a death penalty to a Division I school since Southern Methodist University (SMU) was hit with it in 1987 for massive violations in its football program. Shortly after the release of the Freeh report, the NCAA Board gave Emmert the power to take corrective and punitive action relative to Penn State, forgoing the NCAA's normal investigative protocol. On July 22, 2012, the NCAA announced that it would impose \\"corrective and punitive\\" sanctions against both the Penn State football program and the institution as a whole the next morning. In announcing the sanctions, Emmert said that, although the behavior could be called more egregious than any other seen in NCAA history, and thus a multi- year suspension was appropriate, they concluded that \\"the sanctions needed to reflect our goals of driving cultural change as much as apply punitive actions. Suspension of the football program would bring with it significant unintended harm to many who had nothing to do with this case. The sanctions we have crafted are more focused and impactful than that blanket penalty. Moreover, the actions already taken by the new chair of the board, Karen Peets, and the new president, Rodney Erickson, have demonstrated a strong desire and determination on the part of Penn State to take the steps necessary for the university to right these severe wrongs and were appreciated by all of us.\\" On July 23, Emmert announced the following sanctions against Penn State: * Five years probation. * A four-year postseason ban. * Vacating of all wins from 1998 to 2011‚Äì112 wins in all. This had the effect of stripping the Nittany Lions of their shared Big Ten titles in 2005 and 2008. It also removed 111 wins from Paterno's record, dropping him from first to 12th on the NCAA's all-time wins list. * A $60 million fine, the proceeds of which were to go toward an endowment for preventing child abuse. According to the NCAA, this was the equivalent of a typical year's gross revenue from the football program. * Loss of a total of forty initial scholarships from 2013 to 2017. During the same period, Penn State was to be limited to 65 total scholarships ‚Äî only two more than a Division I FCS (formerly I-AA) school was allowed. * Penn State was required to adopt all recommendations for reform delineated in the Freeh report. * Penn State entered into an \\"athletics integrity agreement\\" with the NCAA and Big Ten, appoint a university-wide athletic compliance officer and compliance council, and accepted an NCAA-appointed athletic integrity monitor for the duration of its probation. The sanctions took the form of a sweeping consent decree in which Penn State accepted the findings of fact by the NCAA and waived any right to appeal the sanctions. A full release was granted to all players in the program, allowing them to transfer to another school without losing eligibility. According to ESPN's Don Van Natta, Jr., the NCAA and Penn State had already begun preliminary discussions about possible sanctions in mid-July.Van Natta, Don Jr. Unprecedented in every way. ESPN, 2012-07-23. The Patriot-News reported that the NCAA formally forwarded its terms to Penn State's legal team on July 19. Discussions continued over the weekend, and the final agreement was essentially the NCAA's original proposal except for some minor concessions to Penn State.Thompson, Charles. Alumni, trustees attack Penn State President Erickson for signing NCAA consent agreement too quickly. The Patriot-News, 2012-07-24. In announcing the sanctions, Emmert said that he intended the Penn State case to be \\"the cautionary tale of athletics overwhelming core values of the institution and losing sight of why we are really participating in these activities can occur.\\" He also said that the sanctions were necessary to force Penn State to reform its athletic culture. The Big Ten followed the NCAA actions, concurring with its findings by officially censuring Penn State and levying a separate fine of $13 million. In a statement, the conference stated that its intentions were \\"not to destroy a great university, but rather to seek justice and constructively assist a member institution with its efforts to reform.\\" The Big Ten financial penalty came as Penn State gave up its four-year share of conference bowl revenue. The $13 million, as with the NCAA fines, will instead be donated to \\"help victims of child sex abuse\\". The NCAA said it was compelled to act outside the normal investigative process due to what it described as the sheer egregiousness of the misconduct detailed in the Freeh report. In the NCAA's view, Spanier, Curley, Schultz and Paterno's cover-up of Sandusky's crimes constituted \\"a failure of institutional and individual integrity,\\" and thus violated basic principles of intercollegiate athletics that were over and above specific NCAA policies. Additionally, the NCAA said that since Penn State had commissioned the Freeh report and accepted its findings, further proceedings would be redundant. Emmert himself said that Freeh's investigation was far more exhaustive than any that would have been mounted by the NCAA. Due to the deviation from normal NCAA investigative process as well as the nature of the sanctions, four trustees of the university filed an appeal of the sanctions. Board member Ryan McCombie, a 26-year U.S. Navy veteran who was elected to the Board in July 2012 by members of the school's alumni association, led the trustee appeal. A letter filed on the trustees' behalf by Paul Kelly of Jackson Lewis LLP called the sanctions \\"excessive and unreasonable\\". The letter also argued that Erickson exceeded his authority in accepting the sanctions. In addition, a group of former Penn State football players, including former starting quarterback Michael Robinson, filed their own appeal. However, a spokesman for the NCAA held that the sanctions were not subject to appeal.  Sanctions rescinded  The validity of the sanctions later came into question, and emails surfaced that indicated highly ranked officials within the NCAA did not believe the organization had the jurisdiction to pass down the original sanctions. Subsequent emails, brought forward under subpoena, quoted an NCAA vice- president, \\"I characterized our approach to PSU as a bluff when talking to Mark [Emmert, NCAA president] ... He basically agreed [because] I think he understands that if we made this an enforcement issue, we may win the immediate battle but lose the war.\\" Another vice-president questioned the NCAA's investigation and enforcement process of Penn State, calling it \\"a bit of a runaway train right now,\\" and wrote that he had concerns regarding the NCAA's jurisdiction to sanction Penn State: \\"I know we are banking on the fact [Penn State] is so embarrassed they will do anything.\\" The NCAA later rescinded many of the sanctions against Penn State. On September 24, 2013, the NCAA announced that Penn State's scholarships would be gradually restored until the number of scholarships reached the normal 85 for the 2016‚Äì17 year, the first year after Penn State's postseason ban. A year later, on September 8, 2014, the NCAA announced that Penn State would be eligible for the 2014 postseason and all scholarships would be restored in 2015. Several months later, on January 16, 2015, the NCAA reinstated Paterno and Bradley's wins. Debate over suspension of the football program At least two Penn State trustees, as well as several alumni, criticized Erickson for accepting the NCAA sanctions as quickly as he had. However, in a press conference shortly after the penalties were handed down, Erickson said that as harsh as they were, he had no choice but to accept them. According to Erickson, had Penn State not accepted the penalties, the NCAA would have gone in \\"another direction\\"‚Äîone that would have included the NCAA canceling at least the 2012 season. Erickson said that under the circumstances, \\"we had our backs to the wall,\\" and he had no choice but to accept the consent decree since it was the only deal on offer.Minemeyer, Chip. Penn State President Erickson on NCAA sanctions: 'Death penalty' was a real possibility . Centre Daily Times, 2012-07-24. Erickson subsequently told ESPN's John Barr that Penn State was facing as long as a four-year ban from play had it not agreed to the sanctions that were ultimately imposed. Erickson went further on July 25, saying that Emmert had personally told him on July 17‚Äîthe day after Emmert's interview with Smiley‚Äîthat a majority of the NCAA leadership wanted to shut down Penn State football for four years. He also said that Penn State could have faced a host of other severe penalties, including a fine several times greater than the $60 million ultimately imposed. When Erickson learned this, he immediately started talks with the NCAA, and was able to get the death penalty taken off the table. Erickson discussed his actions with the Board later that night, and the Board resolved that Erickson's actions were understandable under the circumstances.Van Natta, Don Jr. Penn State faced 4-year death penalty. ESPN, 2012-07-24. Emmert and the NCAA Executive Committee's chairman, Oregon State president Edward John Ray, subsequently acknowledged that the NCAA had seriously considered imposing a death penalty, but denied that Penn State had been threatened with one had it not accepted the consent decree. Ray, whose committee was charged by Emmert with designing the sanctions, told ESPN's Adam Rittenberg that while there was considerable debate about whether to include a death penalty among the sanctions, \\"the overwhelming position of members of both the executive committee and the Division I board was to not include suspension of play.\\" He also \\"categorically\\" denied that the NCAA had threatened Penn State with a death penalty had it not accepted the sanctions, and added that using it as a backup in case of such a rejection was \\"never even a point of discussion within either the executive committee or the Division I board.\\" Emmert himself told ESPN's Bob Ley that the death penalty was \\"unequivocally on the table\\" as one of the possible sanctions. However, he said, Penn State's swift corrective measures after the scandal broke out in full‚Äîincluding forcing out Spanier and Paterno‚Äîwere significant factors in ultimately taking the death penalty off the table. \\"Had Penn State not been as decisive as they were,\\" Emmert said, \\"I don't know what the outcome would have been, but I suspect it would have been significantly worse.\\" Emmert also repeated Ray's denial that Penn State had been threatened with a multi-year suspension had it not agreed to the penalties, saying there had been \\"some confusion\\" about those circumstances. He did say, however, that if Erickson and Penn State had not signed the consent decree, the NCAA would have launched a full-blown infractions investigation that would have had \\"an unknown outcome.\\" In the consent decree itself, the NCAA acknowledged that there had been some discussion about imposing a \\"death penalty,\\" but noted that this severe penalty was primarily reserved for repeat violators who neither cooperated with the NCAA nor took any corrective measures once the violations came to light. However, it not only noted Penn State's swift corrective action, but also pointed out the school had never been the subject of a major infractions case before. This stood in contrast to the situation at SMU 25 years earlier; school officials at SMU knew major violations were occurring and did nothing to stop them, and the school had been under nearly constant scrutiny from the NCAA for over a decade. Civil lawsuits and subsequent developments On November 28, 2011, Fisher and his mother hired attorneys to pursue civil claims against both parties.Boni & Zack LLC and McLaughlin & Lauricella, P.C. to Represent Victim 1 and His Mother in the Jerry Sandusky Sexual Abuse Matter. PR Newswire, November 28, 2011. On November 30, the first lawsuit by a victim of sexual abuse was filed against Penn State and Sandusky alleging over 100 incidents of sexual abuse; the victim was identified in the suit only as \\"John Doe A.\\" A man claiming to be the previously unknown victim of the shower incident (\\"Victim 2\\") stepped forward through his lawyers in July 2012 and stated his intentions to file a lawsuit against Penn State. His lawyers, Ross Feller Casey LLP, also released a pair of voicemails from September 2011 that were purportedly left for the firm's client by Sandusky. On September 20, 2012, Penn State released an announcement that the institution had hired the law firm of Feinberg Rozen LLP to assist in the handling of any personal injury lawsuits that could emerge as a result of the sexual abuse allegations that had been made against Sandusky. Erickson stated that Penn State's ultimate goal was to settle any civil cases in a way that would not force the victims to go through the legal process once again. On October 2, McQueary sued Penn State in Centre County Court for a total of $8 million demanding $4 million for alleged defamation due to Spanier's public statement of support for Curley and Schultz, and another $4 million for alleged misrepresentation after Schultz stated he would take appropriate action after the shower room incident McQueary witnessed. The suit alleges that McQueary was fired because he had cooperated with law enforcement and would serve as a witness in the trial of Schultz and Curley. McQueary was also seeking reinstatement of his job or compensation for lost wages. On January 1, 2013, Governor Tom Corbett announced he would sue the NCAA in federal court over the sanctions imposed on Penn State. Although Corbett is an ex officio member of the Board of Trustees, Penn State was not involved in the suit. According to the AP, Corbett was filing an antitrust suit against the NCAA. Though he had originally \\"endorsed [the NCAA settlement in the immediate wake of the Freeh report] as 'part of the corrective process'\\",\\"Penn State: Lessons Not Learned\\" (editorial), New York Times, January 3, 2013 . Retrieved 2013-01-04. Corbett and other state lawmakers had recently begun to object to the prospect of the $60 million fine being spent mostly outside of Pennsylvania. One reason given for the objection is that there was no legal way Penn State could ensure that taxpayer money wouldn't be used to pay the fine. In sharply criticizing the governor's move in an editorial, The New York Times noted that Corbett \\"barely mentioned the young victims\\" in his statement. It continued: \\"In his complaints, the governor only confirmed the inquiry finding that the university's obsession with football predominance helped drive the cover-up of Mr. Sandusky's crimes.\\" It also noted that, in the suit, Corbett \\"bypassed incoming state attorney general Kathleen Kane [who] in her election campaign last year ... promised to look into why it took so long for the pedophilia scandal to be investigated when Mr. Corbett previously served as attorney general\\". The Patriot-News said of the suit: \\"[It] comes after a year of withering criticism of Corbett by some quarters of the Penn State community, which has seen the governor and his fellow PSU trustees as too quick to brand former head coach Joe Paterno and others as fall guys for the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal.\\"Thompson, Charles, \\"Pennsylvania governor launches suit to void NCAA sanctions against Penn State football\\", The Patriot-News, January 02, 2013. The Patriot-News website linked to the full text of the suit. Retrieved 2013-01-04. On June 6, 2013, federal Middle District Judge Yvette Kane said she could not \\"find any factual allegations\\" and threw out the lawsuit calling, it \\"a Hail Mary pass\\" that easily warranted dismissal. Matthew Sandusky, the adopted son of Jerry Sandusky, was also involved in lawsuits against Penn State. While Matthew originally took his adopted father's side when he was first questioned by the grand jury, he later revealed that Sandusky had started to sexually abuse him when he was 8 years old. Ross Feller Casey LLP went on to represent him in the civil lawsuit, and Matthew reached a settlement with Penn State. He was one of the 26 victims involved in the settlement amount that was reached in October 2013. On August 16, 2013, a man known as Victim 5, who was sexually abused by Sandusky, was the first to settle his civil suit against Penn State for an undisclosed amount. On October 28, Penn State reached settlements with 26 Sandusky victims, costing the university a total of $59.7 million. Victim 6 filed a lawsuit against Penn State on January 22, 2013. However, the lawsuit was dismissed on November 6. A U.S. District Judge in Philadelphia ruled in favor of Penn State, stating that the university could not legally be held liable for Sandusky's actions simply because he was employed there. The judge stated that Victim 6 failed \\"to explain how molestation was the kind of act that Penn State employed Sandusky to perform.\\" On November 21, Victim 9 sued Penn State, citing that the male victim had been unable to reach a settlement with the institution. Stephen E. Raynes of Raynes McCarty released a statement that he and his team had been working closely with Michael Rozen to reach a settlement for Victim 9. Because of Penn State's refusal to compensate his client, they filed a civil lawsuit in an attempt to \\"compel Penn State to finally fulfill its responsibilities to this young man.\\" On April 9, 2015, Penn State trustees voted to approve a settlement with \\"one or more\\" victims from the Sandusky scandal. While both the victims involved and the amount of the settlement remained confidential, another step was taken to provide justice to those whom had suffered at the hands of Sandusky. As of November 27, 2015, the total amount that Penn State owed victims of Sandusky was close to $93 million. An audit of Penn State's financial statements for the 2015 financial year (ending June 30) revealed that the university had made new payments totaling $33.2 million that were all related to Sandusky. The audit also indicated that Penn State had already paid or agreed to pay 32 claims relevant to Sandusky. =Pennsylvania Manufacturers' Association Insurance= In February 2012, Pennsylvania Manufacturers' Association Insurance (PMA), Penn State's liability insurer, asked the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas to limit its exposure from a lawsuit filed by an alleged victim of Sandusky due to both the time of coverage of the policies and possible \\"intentional conduct\\" of the university. PMA, which had a business relationship with Penn State dating back to the 1950s, was sued by the university in February 2013 after the company refused to cover claims from thirty men alleging abuse by Sandusky. As part of the litigation, PMA brought in a lawyer with expertise in sex abuse cases to examine how Penn State vetted claims before paying alleged victims. Noting a surprising lack of documentation, the lawyer wrote, \\"It appears as though Penn State made little effort, if any, to verify the credibility of the claims.\\" Penn Live reported that a court order connected to the PMA case stated that Paterno was allegedly told in 1976 about an accusation of sexual abuse by Sandusky. PMA documents alleged that a boy told Paterno he had been molested by Sandusky, who was then an assistant coach. The order also cited reports by unnamed assistant coaches who said they witnessed inappropriate contact between Sandusky and some children, according to the ruling by Philadelphia Judge Gary Glazer. Penn State spokesman Lawrence Lokman said university officials involved in cases related to the Sandusky scandal were aware of the new allegations contained in the insurance case broadly; Lokman said to Penn Live: \\"Many, many people, potential victims and victims have come forward to the university as part of that (settlement) process... We do not talk about their specific circumstances.\\" CNN reported one of the victims, identified as Victim A, had told Paterno about an incident in a bathroom as early as 1971. NBC also reported that one former Penn State assistant coach witnessed an incident in the late 1970s, and three other coaches ‚Äî who have gone on to work in pro level and other colleges ‚Äî allegedly saw inappropriate conduct between Sandusky and young boys in the 1990s. Risk management expert Raymond Williams identified three incidents with some of the assistant coaches on the Penn State staff at the time, and three others that were reported to university officials; and whether the key officials should have had knowledge about child sex-assault allegations involving Sandusky in each of the six different cases dating to 1976. McQueary alleged former Penn State assistant coaches Greg Schiano and Tom Bradley knew about earlier transgressions by Sandusky. In a deposition related to the PMA case, McQueary claimed that upon telling Bradley what he had seen, Bradley was not shocked and related a story about a time in the 1990s when Schiano had witnessed Sandusky doing something with a boy. Bradley and Schiano denied the allegations. Paterno family members dismissed the accusations. Paterno's wife Sue said in a letter to the Board of Trustees: \\"It is time to end this endless process of character assassination by accusation\\" and asked board members to seek the truth \\"in the spirit of our love for Penn State and our duty to the victims.\\" Paterno's son Scott called the new claims \\"bunk,\\" and expressed on Twitter \\"it would be great if everyone waited to see the substance of the allegation before they assume it's true. Because it's not.\\" Michael Boni, a plaintiff's lawyer in the Sandusky scandal, claimed \\"the headlines of these stories is Paterno knew of Sandusky's molestation in the '70s, '76 or '77. I'm unaware of direct, irrefutable evidence that that's the case... believe me, I'm the last person to defend the guy, but I am the first person to believe in our justice system. And I think you need more than anecdotal evidence or speculative evidence.\\" Penn State president Eric Barron said the accusations were \\"unsubstantiated and unsupported by any evidence other than a claim by an alleged victim\\", and claimed the university is being subjected unfairly to \\"rumor, innuendo and rush to judgment\\". Barron acknowledged the school's Board had spent tens of millions of dollars without making an effort to corroborate claims. \\"None of these allegations ... has been substantiated in a court of law or in any other process to test their veracity,\\" Barron wrote. The university hired settlement experts Kenneth Feinberg and Michael Rozen to handle the claims. The settlement agreements required victims to release several organizations, and anyone connected to them, from lawsuits, including The Second Mile. An Indianapolis attorney who represents sex abuse victims said, \\"That's not normal. Why would Penn State care about The Second Mile?\\" and that he had never encountered a defendant requesting a liability release for a separate organization. Penn State alumni trustee Al Lord said, \\"There's only one reason [for the release], and that was to protect ... members of the board who were involved at the Second Mile.\\" The trustee who chaired the board committee that oversaw negotiations was Ira Lubert, a friend of a former Second Mile board chair as well as part-owner of a summer camp The Second Mile visited. Nicholas Mirkay, a University of Hawaii law school professor and nonprofit governance expert, found it surprising Penn State leadership allowed a board member with even a tangential connection to the Second Mile to lead settlement negotiations. =McQueary vs. Penn State= In October 2016, a jury found that Penn State had defamed McQueary, and awarded him $7 million in damages. Penn State appealed the ruling in November 2016, and the case judge also awarded an additional almost $5 million to McQueary based on a separate charge that his firing was retaliation for whistleblowing. McQueary eventually settled the case for an undisclosed amount before the appeal was heard. =Fines for Clery Act Violations= In November 2016, the U.S. Department of Education announced that it sought to fine Penn State nearly $2.4 million for violating the Clery Act. The violations include failing to alert the public about Sandusky's conduct and other campus dangers. Penn State officials have said that they will not appeal the fine. Findings: Impact At the time of the NCAA sanctions, one columnist had characterized them (scholarship restrictions, a bowl ban, loss of revenue) as a fate \\"worse than death\\" for the Penn State football program - noncompetitiveness on the field. In addition to the expected damage to future recruiting from those sanctions, the NCAA had enacted a temporary exception to transfer rules which allowed current scholarship players to leave the tainted program. Only one high profile player left State College, and the football program did not experience a losing season between Paterno's firing and the first post-sanction bowl game. The football team posted winning records of 9-4 in 2011, 8-4 in 2012, 7-5 in 2013, and 7-6 in 2014. In 2015 the arrival of running back Saquon Barkley heralded 11 win seasons in 2016 and 2017. Penn State's Aa1 revenue-bond rating was \\"placed on review for possible downgrade\\" by Moody's Investors Service because of the scandal's possible effects on the university's finances. After the school was removed from the watchlist in February 2012 and assigned a \\"negative outlook\\" within that rating class due to its \\"ongoing uncertainty\\", Moody's again considered downgrading the bond rating the following July. In October 2012, Moody's downgraded Penn State's bond rating to Aa2 citing \\"anticipation of the substantial financial impact on the university from the ultimate cost of future settlements and possible judgments\\". It wouldn't be until February 2016 that Penn State would see its rating restored to Aa1, with Moody's citing a stable outlook and the university's ability to continue operating despite Pennsylvania's delay in enacting 2016 appropriations. State Farm Insurance pulled its sponsorship of the Nittany Lions football team in July 2012, and asked the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania to declare that there is no provision in its policy with Penn State to force the company to help pay for Sandusky's criminal defense bills or any punitive damages that he has incurred. Penn State reported that the school had spent $3.2 million on investigations, public relations, and legal advice in response to the scandal through the middle of February 2012. On August 15, 2012, Penn State's regional accreditation was put on \\"warning\\" status due to the Sandusky scandal. The Middle States Commission on Higher Education, which accredits the university, continued to accredit Penn State but demanded a report addressing these. In November, the warning status was lifted as the accreditor was \\"impressed by the degree to which Penn State has risen, as a strong campus community, to recognize and respond to the sad events.\\" See also *Baylor University sexual assault scandal, a sexual abuse scandal involving football players *United Kingdom football sexual abuse scandal, similar scandal involving British soccer teams *USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal, a sex abuse scandal involving over 265 female gymnasts *The Ohio State University abuse scandal, a sex abuse scandal involving 177 students and athletes *Paterno, a 2018 film about the Penn State case References Further reading : : : : External links *Sandusky, Penn State case timeline *Jerry Sandusky collected news and commentary from the Patriot-News. *The Freeh Report, its full title is Report of the Special Investigative Counsel Regarding the Actions of the Pennsylvania State University Related to the Child Sexual Abuse Committed by Gerald A.

A test may be administered verbally, on paper, on a computer, or in a predetermined area that requires a test taker to demonstrate or perform a set of skills. Tests vary in style, rigor and requirements. There is no general consensus or invariable standard for test formats and difficulty. Often, the format and difficulty of the test is dependent upon the educational philosophy of the instructor, subject matter, class size, policy of the educational institution, and requirements of accreditation or governing bodies. A test may be administered formally or informally. An example of an informal test is a reading test administered by a parent to a child. A formal test might be a final examination administered by a teacher in a classroom or an IQ test administered by a psychologist in a clinic. Formal testing often results in a grade or a test score.Thissen, D., & Wainer, H. (2001). Test Scoring. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum. Page 1, sentence 1. A test score may be interpreted with regards to a norm or criterion, or occasionally both. The norm may be established independently, or by statistical analysis of a large number of participants. A test may be developed and administered by an instructor, a clinician, a governing body, or a test provider. In some instances, the developer of the test may not be directly responsible for its administration. For example, Educational Testing Service (ETS), a nonprofit educational testing and assessment organization, develops standardized tests such as the SAT but may not directly be involved in the administration or proctoring of these tests. History =Early history= Ancient China was the first country in the world that implemented a nationwide standardized test, which was called the imperial examination. The main purpose of this examination was to select able candidates for specific governmental positions.Advanced Level Examination, Chinese Language and Culture, Paper 1A The imperial examination was established by the Sui dynasty in 605 AD and was later abolished by the Qing dynasty 1300 years later in 1905. England had adopted this examination system in 1806 to select specific candidates for positions in Her Majesty's Civil Service, modeled on the Chinese imperial examination.Bodde, D., Chinese Ideas in the West This examination system was later applied to education and it started to influence other parts of the world as it became a prominent standard (e.g. regulations to prevent the markers from knowing the identity of candidates), of delivering standardized tests. =Modern era= Civil service From the mid 19th century, universities began to institute written examinations to assess the aptitude of the pupils. This is an excerpt from the 1842 Tripos examination in Cambridge University. As the profession transitioned to the modern mass-education system, the style of the civil service entrance examination became fixed, with the stress on standardized papers to be sat by large numbers of students. Leading the way in this regard was the burgeoning Civil Service that began to move toward a meritocratic basis for selection in the mid 19th century in England. British civil service was influenced by the imperial examinations system and meritocratic system of China. Thomas Taylor Meadows, Britain's consul in Guangzhou, China argued in his Desultory Notes on the Government and People of China, published in 1847, that \\"the long duration of the Chinese empire is solely and altogether owing to the good government which consists in the advancement of men of talent and merit only\\", and that the British must reform their civil service by making the institution meritocratic. As early as in 1806, the Honourable East India Company established a college near London to train and examine administrators of the Company's territories in India.(Bodde 2005) Examinations for the Indian \\"civil service\\" (a term coined by the Company) were introduced in 1829. In 1853 the Chancellor of the Exchequer William Gladstone, commissioned Sir Stafford Northcote and Charles Trevelyan to look into the operation and organisation of the Civil Service. Influenced by the ancient Chinese Imperial Examination, the Northcote‚ÄìTrevelyan Report of 1854 made four principal recommendations: that recruitment should be on the basis of merit determined through standardized written examination, that candidates should have a solid general education to enable inter-departmental transfers, that recruits should be graded into a hierarchy, and that promotion should be through achievement, rather than 'preferment, patronage, or purchase'.Kazin, Edwards, and Rothman (2010), 142. A Civil Service Commission was also set up in 1855 to oversee open recruitment and end patronage, and most of the other Northcote‚ÄìTrevelyan recommendations were implemented over some years. The Northcote‚ÄìTrevelyan model of meritocratic examination remained essentially stable for a hundred years. This was a tribute to its success in removing corruption, delivering public services (even under the stress of two world wars), and responding effectively to political change. It also had a great international influence and was adapted by members of the Commonwealth. The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act established a similar system in the United States. Education Students taking a scholarship examination in a classroom in 1940 Written examinations had been unheard of before 1702 for European education. \\"The Chinese examinations were described repeatedly in Western literature on China of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\\"Bodde, D., Chinese Ideas in the West, p.9 Standardized testing began to influence the method of examination in British universities from the 1850s, where oral exam had been the norm since the Middle Ages. In the US, the transition happened under the influence of the educational reformer Horace Mann. This shift decisively helped to move education into the modern era, by standardizing expanding curricula in the sciences and humanities, creating a rationalized method for the evaluation of teachers and institutions and creating a basis for the streaming of students according to ability. Both World War I and World War II demonstrated the necessity of standardized testing and the benefits associated with these tests. Tests were used to determine the mental aptitude of recruits to the military. The US Army used the Stanford‚ÄìBinet Intelligence Scale to test the IQ of the soldiers.Kaplan, R. M., & Saccuzzo, D. P. (2009) Psychological Testing Belmont, CA: Wadsworth After the War, industry began using tests to evaluate applicants for various jobs based on performance. In 1952, the first Advanced Placement (AP) test was administered to begin closing the gap between high schools and colleges. Modern-day use =Education= Tests are used throughout most educational systems. Tests may range from brief, informal questions chosen by the teacher to major tests that students and teachers spend months preparing for. Some countries such as the United Kingdom and France require all their secondary school students to take a standardized test on individual subjects such as the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) (in England) and Baccalaur√©at respectively as a requirement for graduation. These tests are used primarily to assess a student's proficiency in specific subjects such as mathematics, science, or literature. In contrast, high school students in other countries such as the United States may not be required to take a standardized test to graduate. Moreover, students in these countries usually take standardized tests only to apply for a position in a university program and are typically given the option of taking different standardized tests such as the ACT or SAT, which are used primarily to measure a student's reasoning skill.Name changed in 1996. High school students in the United States may also take Advanced Placement tests on specific subjects to fulfill university-level credit. Depending on the policies of the test maker or country, administration of standardized tests may be done in a large hall, classroom, or testing center. A proctor or invigilator may also be present during the testing period to provide instructions, to answer questions, or to prevent cheating. Grades or test scores from standardized test may also be used by universities to determine if a student applicant should be admitted into one of its academic or professional programs. For example, universities in the United Kingdom admit applicants into their undergraduate programs based primarily or solely on an applicant's grades on pre-university qualifications such as the GCE A-levels or Cambridge Pre-U. In contrast, universities in the United States use an applicant's test score on the SAT or ACT as just one of their many admission criteria to determine if an applicant should be admitted into one of its undergraduate programs. The other criteria in this case may include the applicant's grades from high school, extracurricular activities, personal statement, and letters of recommendations. Once admitted, undergraduate students in the United Kingdom or United States may be required by their respective programs to take a comprehensive examination as a requirement for passing their courses or for graduating from their respective programs. Standardized tests are sometimes used by certain countries to manage the quality of their educational institutions. For example, the No Child Left Behind Act in the United States requires individual states to develop assessments for students in certain grades. In practice, these assessments typically appear in the form of standardized tests. Test scores of students in specific grades of an educational institution are then used to determine the status of that educational institution, i.e., whether it should be allowed to continue to operate in the same way or to receive funding. Finally, standardized tests are sometimes used to compare proficiencies of students from different institutions or countries. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) uses Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) to evaluate certain skills and knowledge of students from different participating countries. =Licensing and certification= Standardized tests are sometimes used by certain governing bodies to determine if a test taker is allowed to practice a profession, to use a specific job title, or to claim competency in a specific set of skills. For example, a test taker who intends to become a lawyer is usually required by a governing body such as a governmental bar licensing agency to pass a bar exam. =Immigration and naturalization= Standardized tests are also used in certain countries to regulate immigration. For example, intended immigrants to Australia are legally required to pass a citizenship test as part of that country's naturalization process. = Language testing in naturalization process = When analyzed in the context of language texting in the naturalization processes, the ideology can be found from two distinct but nearly related points. One refers to the construction and deconstruction of the nation's constitutive elements that makes their own identity, while the second has a more restricted view of the notion of specific language and ideologies that may served in a specific purpose. =Intelligence quotient= =Competitions= Tests are sometimes used as a tool to select for participants that have potential to succeed in a competition such as a sporting event. For example, serious skaters who wish to participate in figure skating competitions in the United States must pass official U.S. Figure Skating tests just to qualify. =Group memberships= Tests are sometimes used by a group to select for certain types of individuals to join the group. For example, Mensa International is a high-IQ society that requires individuals to score at the 98th percentile or higher on a standardized, supervised IQ test. Types Assessment types include:Carnegie Mellon UniversityScholasticEdutopia *Formative assessments are informal and formal tests taken during the learning process. These assessments modify the later learning activities, to improve student achievement. They identify strengths and weaknesses and help target areas that need work. *Summative assessments evaluate competence at the end of an instructional unit, with the goal of determining if the candidate has assimilated the knowledge or skills to the required standard. Summative assessments may cover a few days' instruction, an entire term's work in cases such as final exams, or even multiple years' study, in the case of high school exit exams, GCE Advanced Level examples, or professional licensing tests such as the United States Medical Licensing Examination. *Norm-referenced tests compare a student's performance against a national or other \\"norm\\" group. Only a certain percentage of test takers will get the best and worse scores. Norm-referencing is usually called grading on a curve when the comparison group is students in the same classroom. *Criterion- referenced tests are designed to measure student performance against a fixed set of criteria or learning standards. It is possible for all test takers to pass, just like it is possible for all test takers to fail. *Performance-based assessments require students to solve real-world problems or produce something with real-world application. For example, the student can demonstrate baking skills by baking a cake, and having the outcome judged for appearance, flavor, and texture. *Authentic assessment is the measurement of accomplishments that are worth while compared to multiple-choice standardized tests. For example, an authentic assessment of arithmetic skills is figuring out how much the family's groceries will cost this week. This provides as much information about the students' addition skills as a test question that asks what the sum of various numbers are. *Standardized tests are all tests that are administered and scored in a consistent manner, regardless of whether it is a quick quiz created by the local teacher or a heavily researched test given to millions of people.North Central Regional Educational Laboratory, NCREL.org Standardized tests are often used in education, professional certification, psychology (e.g., MMPI), the military, and many other fields. *Non- standardized tests are flexible in scope and format, and variable in difficulty. For example, a teacher may go around the classroom and ask each student a different question. Some questions will inevitably be harder than others, and the teacher may be more strict with the answers from better students. A non-standardized test may be used to determine the proficiency level of students, to motivate students to study, to provide feedback to students, and to modify the curriculum to make it more appropriate for either low- or high-skill students. *High-stakes tests are tests with important consequences for the individual test taker, such as getting a driver's license. A high-stakes test does not need to be a high-stress test, if the test taker is confident of passing. A single test can have multiple qualities. For example, the bar exam for aspiring lawyers may be a norm-referenced, standardized, summative assessment. This means that only the test takers with higher scores will pass, that all of them took the same test under the same circumstances and were graded with the same scoring standards, and that the test is meant to determine whether the law school graduates have learned enough to practice their profession. Assessment formats =Written tests= Indonesian students taking a written test Written tests are tests that are administered on paper or on a computer (as an eExam). A test taker who takes a written test could respond to specific items by writing or typing within a given space of the test or on a separate form or document. In some tests; where knowledge of many constants or technical terms is required to effectively answer questions, like Chemistry or Biology ‚Äì the test developer may allow every test taker to bring with them a cheat sheet. A test developer's choice of which style or format to use when developing a written test is usually arbitrary given that there is no single invariant standard for testing. Be that as it may, certain test styles and format have become more widely used than others. Below is a list of those formats of test items that are widely used by educators and test developers to construct paper or computer-based tests. As a result, these tests may consist of only one type of test item format (e.g., multiple-choice test, essay test) or may have a combination of different test item formats (e.g., a test that has multiple- choice and essay items).  Multiple choice  In a test that has items formatted as multiple-choice questions, a candidate would be given a number of set answers for each question, and the candidate must choose which answer or group of answers is correct. There are two families of multiple-choice questions. The first family is known as the True/False question and it requires a test taker to choose all answers that are appropriate. The second family is known as One-Best-Answer question and it requires a test taker to answer only one from a list of answers. There are several reasons to using multiple-choice questions in tests. In terms of administration, multiple- choice questions usually requires less time for test takers to answer, are easy to score and grade, provide greater coverage of material, allows for a wide range of difficulty, and can easily diagnose a test taker's difficulty with certain concepts. As an educational tool, multiple-choice items test many levels of learning as well as a test taker's ability to integrate information, and it provides feedback to the test taker about why distractors were wrong and why correct answers were right. Nevertheless, there are difficulties associated with the use of multiple-choice questions. In administrative terms, multiple-choice items that are effective usually take a great time to construct. As an educational tool, multiple-choice items do not allow test takers to demonstrate knowledge beyond the choices provided and may even encourage guessing or approximation due to the presence of at least one correct answer. For instance, a test taker might not work out explicitly that 6.14 \\\\cdot 7.95=48.813, but knowing that 6 \\\\cdot 8=48, they would choose an answer close to 48. Moreover, test takers may misinterpret these items and in the process, perceive these items to be tricky or picky. Finally, multiple- choice items do not test a test taker's attitudes towards learning because correct responses can be easily faked.  Alternative response  True/False questions present candidates with a binary choice ‚Äì a statement is either true or false. This method presents problems, as depending on the number of questions, a significant number of candidates could get 100% just by guesswork, and should on average get 50%. Matching type A matching item is an item that provides a defined term and requires a test taker to match identifying characteristics to the correct term.  Completion type  A fill-in-the-blank item provides a test taker with identifying characteristics and requires the test taker to recall the correct term. There are two types of fill-in-the-blank tests. The easier version provides a word bank of possible words that will fill in the blanks. For some exams all words in the word bank are used exactly once. If a teacher wanted to create a test of medium difficulty, they would provide a test with a word bank, but some words may be used more than once and others not at all. The hardest variety of such a test is a fill-in-the-blank test in which no word bank is provided at all. This generally requires a higher level of understanding and memory than a multiple-choice test. Because of this, fill-in-the-blank tests[with no word bank] are often feared by students.  Essay  Items such as short answer or essay typically require a test taker to write a response to fulfill the requirements of the item. In administrative terms, essay items take less time to construct. As an assessment tool, essay items can test complex learning objectives as well as processes used to answer the question. The items can also provide a more realistic and generalizable task for test. Finally, these items make it difficult for test takers to guess the correct answers and require test takers to demonstrate their writing skills as well as correct spelling and grammar. The difficulties with essay items are primarily administrative: for example, test takers require adequate time to be able to compose their answers. When these questions are answered, the answers themselves are usually poorly written because test takers may not have time to organize and proofread their answers. In turn, it takes more time to score or grade these items. When these items are being scored or graded, the grading process itself becomes subjective as non-test related information may influence the process. Thus, considerable effort is required to minimize the subjectivity of the grading process. Finally, as an assessment tool, essay questions may potentially be unreliable in assessing the entire content of a subject matter. Instructions to exam takers rely on the use of command words which direct the examinee to respond in a particular way, for example by describing or defining a concept, comparing and contrasting two or more scenarios or events. In the UK, Ofqual maintains an official list of command words explaining their meaning.AQA, Command words, accessed 27 December 2018 Quizzes A quiz is a brief assessment which may cover a small amount of material that was given in a class. Some of them cover two to three lectures that were given in a period of times as a reading section or a given exercise in were the most important part of the class was summarize. However, a simple quiz usually does not count very much, and instructors usually provide this type of test as a formative assessment to help determine whether the student is learning the material. In addition, doing this at the time the instructor collected all can make a significant part of the final course grade.  Mathematical questions  Most mathematics questions, or calculation questions from subjects such as chemistry, physics, or economics employ a style which does not fall into any of the above categories, although some papers, notably the Maths Challenge papers in the United Kingdom employ multiple choice. Instead, most mathematics questions state a mathematical problem or exercise that requires a student to write a freehand response. Marks are given more for the steps taken than for the correct answer. If the question has multiple parts, later parts may use answers from previous sections, and marks may be granted if an earlier incorrect answer was used but the correct method was followed, and an answer which is correct (given the incorrect input) is returned. Higher-level mathematical papers may include variations on true/false, where the candidate is given a statement and asked to verify its validity by direct proof or stating a counterexample.  Open- note Tests  Though not as popular as the closed-note test, open-note tests are slowly rising in popularity. An open-note test allows the test taker to bring in all of their notes and use them while taking the test. The questions asked on open-note exams are typically more thought provoking and intellectual than questions on a closed-note exam. Rather than testing what facts you know, open-note exams force you to apply the facts to a broader question. The main benefit that is seen from open-note tests is that they are a better preparation for the real world where you don't have to memorize and have anything you need at your disposal. =Oral tests= An oral test is a test that is answered orally (verbally). The teacher or oral test assessor will verbally ask a question to a student, who will then answer it using words. =Physical fitness tests= A Minnesota National Guardsman performs pushups during a physical fitness test. A physical fitness test is a test designed to measure physical strength, agility, and endurance. They are commonly employed in educational institutions as part of the physical education curriculum, in medicine as part of diagnostic testing, and as eligibility requirements in fields that focus on physical ability such as military or police. Throughout the 20th century, scientific evidence emerged demonstrating the usefulness of strength training and aerobic exercise in maintaining overall health, and more agencies began to incorporate standardized fitness testing. In the United States, the President's Council on Youth Fitness was established in 1956 as a way to encourage and monitor fitness in schoolchildren. Common tests include timed running or the multi-stage fitness test (commonly known as the \\"beep test\\"), and numbers of push-ups, sit-ups/abdominal crunches, and pull-ups that the individual can perform. More specialised tests may be used to test ability to perform a particular job or role. Many gyms, private organisations and event organizers have their own fitness tests. Using military techniques developed by the British Army and modern test like Illinois Agility Run and Cooper Test. Stop watch timing was the norm until recent years when hand timing has been proven to be inaccurate and inconsistent. Electronic timing is the new norm in order to promote accuracy and consistency, and lessen bias. =Performance tests= A performance test is an assessment that requires an examinee to actually perform a task or activity, rather than simply answering questions referring to specific parts. The purpose is to ensure greater fidelity to what is being tested. An example is a behind-the-wheel driving test to obtain a driver's license. Rather than only answering simple multiple- choice items regarding the driving of an automobile, a student is required to actually drive one while being evaluated. Performance tests are commonly used in workplace and professional applications, such as professional certification and licensure. When used for personnel selection, the tests might be referred to as a work sample. A licensure example would be cosmetologists being required to demonstrate a haircut or manicure on a live person. The Group‚ÄìBourdon test is one of a number of psychometric tests which trainee train drivers in the UK are required to pass. Some performance tests are simulations. For instance, the assessment to become certified as an ophthalmic technician includes two components, a multiple-choice examination and a computerized skill simulation. The examinee must demonstrate the ability to complete seven tasks commonly performed on the job, such as retinoscopy, that are simulated on a computer. Preparations From the perspective of a test developer, there is great variability with respect to time and effort needed to prepare a test. Likewise, from the perspective of a test taker, there is also great variability with respect to the time and needed to obtain a desired grade or score on any given test. When a test developer constructs a test, the amount of time and effort is dependent upon the significance of the test itself, the proficiency of the test taker, the format of the test, class size, deadline of test, and experience of the test developer. The process of test construction has been aided in several ways. For one, many test developers were themselves students at one time, and therefore are able to modify or outright adopt questions from their previous tests. In some countries, book publishers often provide teaching packages that include test banks to university instructors who adopt their published books for their courses. These test banks may contain up to four thousand sample test questions that have been peer-reviewed and time-tested. The instructor who chooses to use this testbank would only have to select a fixed number of test questions from this test bank to construct a test. As with test constructions, the time needed for a test taker to prepare for a test is dependent upon the frequency of the test, the test developer, and the significance of the test. In general, nonstandardized tests that are short, frequent, and do not constitute a major portion of the test taker's overall course grade or score do not require the test taker to spend much time preparing for the test. Conversely, nonstandardized tests that are long, infrequent, and do constitute a major portion of the test taker's overall course grade or score usually require the test taker to spend great amounts of time preparing for the test. To prepare for a nonstandardized test, test takers may rely upon their reference books, class or lecture notes, Internet, and past experience. Test takers may also use various learning aids to study for tests such as flashcards and mnemonics. Test takers may even hire tutors to coach them through the process so that they may increase the probability of obtaining a desired test grade or score. In countries such as the United Kingdom, demand for private tuition has increased significantly in recent years. Finally, test takers may rely upon past copies of a test from previous years or semesters to study for a future test. These past tests may be provided by a friend or a group that has copies of previous tests or by instructors and their institutions, or by the test provider (such as an examination board) itself. Unlike a nonstandardized test, the time needed by test takers to prepare for standardized tests is less variable and usually considerable. This is because standardized tests are usually uniform in scope, format, and difficulty and often have important consequences with respect to a test taker's future such as a test taker's eligibility to attend a specific university program or to enter a desired profession. It is not unusual for test takers to prepare for standardized tests by relying upon commercially available books that provide in-depth coverage of the standardized test or compilations of previous tests (e.g., ten year series in Singapore). In many countries, test takers even enroll in test preparation centers or cram schools that provide extensive or supplementary instructions to test takers to help them better prepare for a standardized test. In Hong Kong, it has been suggested that the tutors running such centers are celebrities in their own right. This has led to private tuition being a popular career choice for new graduates in developed economies. Finally, in some countries, instructors and their institutions have also played a significant role in preparing test takers for a standardized test. Cheating Invigilators may oversee a test to reduce cheating methods such as copying Cheating on a test is the process of using unauthorized means or methods for the purpose of obtaining a desired test score or grade. This may range from bringing and using notes during a closed book examination, to copying another test taker's answer or choice of answers during an individual test, to sending a paid proxy to take the test. Several common methods have been employed to combat cheating. They include the use of multiple proctors or invigilators during a testing period to monitor test takers. Test developers may construct multiple variants of the same test to be administered to different test takers at the same time, or write tests with few multiple- choice options, based on the theory that fully worked answers are difficult to imitate. In some cases, instructors themselves may not administer their own tests but will leave the task to other instructors or invigilators, which may mean that the invigilators do not know the candidates, and thus some form of identification may be required. Another method is that if the student showed too many failed test at given color levels, the students have to begin again at work in through additional skills builders, at that level the student choose to drop down a color level or obtain a missing prerequisite skills. For that if the student passed the requisites number of test without a color level, the student will color by his or her name a large wall chart that provide the status of the entire class. Finally, instructors or test providers may compare the answers of suspected cheaters on the test themselves to determine if cheating did occur.

History summary  Fort McKinney was named after Second Lieutenant John McKinney, of the 4th United States Cavalry Regiment, who was Killed in action in the Dull Knife Fight on November 25, 1876, at the Red Fork of the Powder River in Wyoming Territory. The Fort was created in 1877 as part of the intensive reaction to the defeat of Lieutenant Colonel George A. Custer and the 7th Cavalry Regiment at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in June, 1876, and was soon outmoded as the Plains Indian Wars came to an end. McKinney was located first on the Powder River in Wyoming, then moved to the Clear Fork of the Powder River, near present-day Buffalo, Wyoming. The Companies stationed at Fort McKinney throughout its history were of the 6th United States Cavalry Regiment, and the 9th United States Cavalry Regiment, the 9th Cavalry being one of only four completely African-American United States army regiments during the Indian Wars Period, informally called \\"Buffalo Soldiers\\". Various Companies of the 6th Cavalry stationed at the Fort took part in Wyoming's \\"Johnson County War\\". Fort McKinney was closed in 1894, and the land and remaining buildings transferred to the State of Wyoming, who made the site the Wyoming Soldiers and Sailors Home starting in 1903. The first Fort McKinney, on the Powder River (1877-1878) The name Fort McKinney was first given to a military post previously named Cantonment Reno, located on the Powder River near the old Bozeman Trail crossing. Near this site on the Bozeman Trail Fort Connor (renamed Fort Reno) had been constructed in 1865, but was abandoned after the 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie. The tribes promptly burned the fort.WyoHistory.org, A project of the Wyoming State Historical Society, Section on \\"Cantonment Reno\\" Cantonment Reno had been re-established in late 1876, about 3 miles from the site of old Fort Reno. In just 3 months 42 buildings were erected at the Cantonment, including multiple storehouses, living quarters and a hospital. It started as a temporary base of operations for General George Crook's 1876 Big Horn ExpeditionWyoming State Historic Preservation Office, National Register of Historic Places, Fort McKinney which had been launched in the fall of 1876 as part of the intensive campaign against the Sioux and Cheyenne following General George A. Custer's defeat at the Battle of the Little Bighorn on June 25, 1876. On November 25, 1876, part of Crook's command, under the leadership of Col. Ranald S. Mackenzie, attacked a village of Cheyenne (sometimes referred to as \\"Dull Knife's village\\") on the nearby Red Fork of the Powder River in the Dull Knife Fight. The army surprised and scattered the Cheyennes driving men, women and children out of their village into subzero temperatures and snow on the open prairie. Cantonment Reno provided logistic support for the attack, and rudimentary care for the army wounded after the battle. Second Lieutenant John A. McKinney died in the battle on the Red Fork, and in January 1877, Cantonment Reno was renamed Fort McKinney in his honor. The second Fort McKinney, on the Clear Fork of the Powder River, near present-day Buffalo Wyoming (1878-1894) By 1878, the first site of Fort McKinney, on the Powder River was experiencing lumber, forage and water shortages. After considerable study a decision was made to relocate Fort McKinney 45 miles northwest, to a site on the Clear Fork of the Powder River. The new site of Fort McKinney was on benchlands just north of the Clear Fork, and only a few miles from where the stream issues from the Big Horn Mountains. The site is located two miles west of present-day Buffalo, Wyoming. Construction at the new site of Fort McKinney started in 1878 by two companies of the 9th Infantry, commanded by Captain Pollock. The new fort, at peak of development, had buildings to house seven companies of troops, officer's quarters, a warehouse, administrative offices, bakery, dairy, laundress quarters, a hospital, and auxiliary structures. Changing role after 1878 When built on the Clear Fork of the Powder in 1878 the purpose of the Fort was to provide support and supplies to army campaigns aimed at driving Sioux and Cheyenne Plains Indian groups out of their buffalo hunting grounds located in the Powder River country between the Black Hills and the Big Horn Mountains. These lands in the Powder River Basin had been ceded to the Sioux in the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868 as a hunting preserve to supplement the Sioux reservations lands in the southwest quarter of the Dakota Territory. Since the 1860s, several groups of Indians, most notably Sitting Bull's band of Sioux had lived year-round in this vast hunting preserve and never gone to the reservations in the Dakota Territory. When gold was discovered on the Sioux Reservation in the Black Hills area in 1874 this caused a rush of miners into the Black Hills to Deadwood, Lead and other sites. The United States demanded that the Sioux cede back the Black Hills area, and the refusal by the Sioux resulted in the Great Sioux War of 1876, during which the Sioux defeated General George A. Custer at the Battle of the Little Bighorn on June 25, 1876. The United States Army used this defeat as a provocation to launch a massive campaign starting in the fall of 1876 to prevent the Sioux and Cheyenne from continuing their old nomadic way of life in the Powder River Country, and to force these Indian groups out of their vast hunting preserve and onto the reservations along the Missouri River. By the end of 1878 these intensive military campaigns had driven the Sioux and Cheyenne Indian bands who had lived in the Powder River country to move onto the reservations or, in the case of Sitting Bull, to flee to Canada. This brought a swift end to active campaigning against hostile Indian groups in the Powder River Basin and surrounding areas. The end of active Indian war campaigns on the northern plains caused the fort to shift its role to keeping Shoshoni, Arapahoe and Crow tribes, who had reservations in the general area, from resuming intermittent strife with other groups seen as tribal enemies. Another role was to keep bands of these tribes from becoming embroiled with settlers. Tribal Indian groups quickly became dependent on government rationing on the reservations and thus became tied to their reservation areas. As this occurred, the Fort's role shifted again to providing security and support to civilians living in the vicinity. The comforting presence of Fort McKinney was a major impetus to the founding of the nearby community of Buffalo, Wyoming in 1879. With the Indians removed from the scene, between 1878 and 1882 \\"hide hunters\\" had swiftly killed off the vast herds of buffalo that had roamed in the Powder River country, shipping their hides east where they were primarily used for industrial belting. I this same period, the vast but now empty grasslands along the Powder River attracted businessmen who started the Wyoming cattle industry, utilizing the transcontinental Union Pacific railroad that ran through the southern half of Wyoming to ship their cattle to market. The presence of the fort encouraged the growing cattle industry in the sparsely settled Powder River grasslands. Fort McKinney troops built and maintained the first telegraph line in the region. Fort McKinney troops guarded the Rock Creek Stage Line, which provided mail, passenger and express service from Rock Creek (near present-day Rock River, Wyoming) to Terry's Landing (near present-day Custer, Montana) on the Yellowstone in Montana Territory. This stage route extended over 200 miles across mostly empty country, and Fort McKinney's location near the midpoint of the line helped prevent trouble along the line. In the 1880s and 1890s units of the 6th Cavalry were assigned to the Fort, as well as units of the black 9th Cavalry. The fort was a duty station for soldiers who had gained military fame in other venues, including Sgt. John Nihill and Charles B. Gatewood. Lt. Gatewood is recalled for his interaction with Geronimo. Sgt. Nihill is recalled for his heroics in Arizona, and for his skill as a marksman with a rifle, which he developed and then displayed over a period of years, including a stint at Ft. McKinney in 1882 and 1883. Involvement in the Johnson County War On April 13, 1892 troops of the 6th Cavalry at the fort received orders by telegraph from President Benjamin Harrison to intervene in Wyoming's Johnson County War. The troops were ordered to take into custody about 40 persons, consisting mostly of Texas gunmen with a few Wyoming stockmen mixed in. They had become besieged at the TA ranch, south of Buffalo, by irate citizens of Buffalo and Johnson County. The stockmen, acting outside the law, had hired the gunman to undertake an \\"invasion\\" of Johnson County intent on killing a list of men they believed to be cattle thieves. The citizens had risen, armed themselves and surrounded the \\"invaders\\" and were carrying forward plans to burn them out of the ranch buildings where they had taken refuge when the cavalry arrived in the nick of time. Lt. Charles B. Gatewood was a United States cavalry officer who had gained fame in 1886 when he took a small contingent of soldiers, scouts and interpreters and located the Apache war leader Geronimo at a remote location in Mexico, and then personally convinced Geronimo to make his final surrender to General Nelson Miles at Skeleton Canyon, Arizona on September 4, 1886. In September 1891 Lt. Gatewood was assigned to the 6th Cavalry, then stationed at Fort McKinney, Wyoming. He had rejoined his unit after a convalescence for rheumatism. After the events of April 1892, on May 18, 1892 cowboys from a local ranch set fire to the Post Exchange at Fort McKinney and planted a bomb in the form of gunpowder in a barracks stove. Gatewood was responding to the fire and was injured by a bomb blast in a barracks; his left arm was shattered, rendering him too disabled to serve in the Cavalry. He was discharged in November 1892, and died a year later of stomach cancer. The large stockmen of Wyoming, who held political control of the state, demanded that their United States Senator arrange to send black troops to Wyoming to \\"prevent any sympathetic relations that might develop between small ranchers and white troops\\".Schubert, Frank N. \\"Voices of the Buffalo soldier: Records, Reports, and Recollections of Military Life and Service in the West\\", 2003, University of New Mexico Press, , page 174 Soon after, The Ninth Cavalry of \\"Buffalo Soldiers\\" was ordered to Fort McKinney to replace the Sixth Cavalry.Schubert, Frank N. \\"The Suggs Affray: The Black Cavalry in the Johnson County War\\" The Western Historical Quarterly, Vol. 4, No. 1 (January 1973), pp. 57‚Äì68 Closure in 1894, transfer to state of Wyoming, becoming the Wyoming Soldiers and Sailors Home in 1903 In 1894 the fort was closed. Some of the buildings were disposed of, and the remainder, along with a large tract of land was turned over by the U.S. government to the state of Wyoming. Following the transfer most of the rest of the buildings were changed or dismantled. In 1903 Wyoming established the Wyoming Soldiers and Sailors Home at the site. The old fort hospital building, moved from its original location, is today the visitors' house of the home. The only other remaining structures at the site are a mule and cavalry stable, now used as a garage, the dairy, and some foundations.WyoHistory.Org A project of the Wyoming State Historical Society, Section on Fort McKinney Visiting The site of the first Ft. McKinney, aka Cantonment Reno, is located in Johnson County, Wyoming. The site is in an open prairie environment on the Powder river, near the old Bozeman Trail crossing of the Powder River. No buildings or significant ruins remain from the active period in 1876-77. It may be visited year-round as weather permits. The site of the second Fort McKinney on Clear Fork of the Powder, is commemorated by a highway interpretive sign located about two miles west of Buffalo, Wyo., on U.S Highway 16.

At a height of 5'9 \\" (1.76 m) tall, and a weight of 170 pounds (77 kg),Rashad Phillips Altezza: Peso: 176 cm 77 kg . he played at the guard position. Since retiring from basketball, he started and continues to run, \\"Skills Unlimited\\", a training and mentoring program for children, that uses basketball as a vehicle to help them overcome their obstacles. Early life Phillips, a native of the North Central section of Detroit, Michigan, grew up in a rough neighborhood. His father, Virgil, wanted to keep him off the streets, so he created a program called REACH (an acronym for religion, education, athletics, character and hope), where Rashad and others could go to play basketball and stay out of trouble. Later, when he was a senior at college, Phillips said, \\"I thank God every day for giving me a father who did the things he did for me... I've seen a lot of people fall victim to the streets, but that was never an option for me. I always had a gym to go to. What my father has done has saved so many lives.\\" In the fall of 1992, Phillips entered Ferndale High School, in Ferndale, Michigan, as a freshman. At first, he was told he was too small to be a basketball player, but he quickly proved he could play, despite his stature, and ended up becoming one of the first four-year varsity starters in school history. By the time Phillips was a senior, in 1995‚Äì96, he had only grown to . Phillips, however, still averaged approximately 25 points, seven assists and four steals per game, en route to being named Oakland County's best player. He was also invited to play in the Magic Roundball Classic, an annual all-star high school basketball game, where the best players in the country are selected to participate, as an alternate, and played for the West in place of an injured Mateen Cleaves. The game was held at The Palace of Auburn Hills, in Detroit, and Phillips earned the West's Most Valuable Player (MVP) award after out- performing Kobe Bryant. Bryant was the number one high school recruit at the time, and would be a first-round draft choice in the 1996 NBA Draft, just three months later. Phillips' performance caused him to become a heavily recruited prospect, but by then, he had already committed to play at the University of Detroit Mercy. College career Phillips stood at 5'8\\" (1.73 m) when he entered college. He averaged 10.0 points per game in his first season, and was named the Midwestern Collegiate Conference's (MCC) Newcomer of the Year. The Titans were conference regular season champions, behind a 12‚Äì2 MCC record, and earned a berth into the 1998 NCAA Tournament. After upsetting St. John's in the first round, Detroit lost in the round of 32, to a strong Purdue squad, ending their year with an overall record of 25‚Äì6. During his sophomore season, in 1998‚Äì99, he increased his average to 15.7 points per game, which would be the first of three consecutive years in which he led Detroit in that category. The Titans repeated as regular season champions, and also won the MCC Tournament, which gave them an automatic berth into the 1999 NCAA Tournament. Phillips played a big role in 12th-seeded Detroit's upset over 5th-seeded UCLA, by a score of 56‚Äì53, during the opening round game. Just like the season before, when they scored a major upset to open the tournament, Detroit then found itself on the losing end in the round of 32, this time at the hands of 4th-seeded Ohio State. At the end of the 25‚Äì6 season, Phillips was named to the All-MCC First Team. As a junior, in 1999‚Äì2000, the Titans failed to qualify for any postseason tournaments, since they only finished with a 20‚Äì12 (8‚Äì6 MCC) record. Phillips' scoring average, meanwhile, rose to a career-best 23.0 points per game, while he also finished in the top 10 in the nation. His average led the Midwestern Collegiate Conference, while his 735 total points scored is still the fourth-highest single season mark in school history. He repeated as both an All-MCC First Team selection, as well as an All-Defensive Team selection. Phillips was named the MCC Men's Basketball Player of the Year, becoming the first Detroit Titan ever to be honored as the league's Newcomer of the Year and Player of the Year during his career. In 2000‚Äì01, the Titans finished in second place in the MCC, behind Butler, with a 10‚Äì4 record. Phillips averaged 22.4 points per game, tops in the MCC, while leading the school to a fourth-place finish in the 2001 National Invitation Tournament ‚Äì their highest-ever finish in a major postseason tournament. After losing to Alabama in the semifinals, Detroit then played Memphis for the NIT Third Place game, but also fell short in that game, placing fourth. On the year, Phillips set still-standing single season school-records of 785 total points scored, and a 91.6% accuracy from the free throw line. Additionally, he finished with the fourth-highest free throw percentage in all of NCAA Division I. Phillips also set many school top ten records that season, including a career-high of 41 points scored against UW‚ÄìGreen Bay, in January. The Midwestern Collegiate Conference honored him with a third consecutive All-MCC First Team selection, as well as his second straight MCC Player of the Year award. He became just the third player ever to lead the conference in scoring multiple times, and he ended his collegiate career with a still-standing Detroit record of 2,319 points scored. His 348 made three-pointers and 541 made free throws, both also top the program's record book. Phillips garnered national acclaim for his season and career, not just conference awards. The Associated Press named him as an Honorable Mention All-American, and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame presented him as the 2001 Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award winner, given annually to the best Division I men's basketball player, who is or shorter. Professional career Phillips was chosen to play in the Portsmouth Invitational Tournament (PIT), after the school year ended. The PIT is composed of the top 64 recently graduated basketball players in the country, and is an opportunity for them to showcase their talent, heading into the National Basketball Association (NBA) Draft. At the 49th installment of the tournament, Phillips earned MVP honors, after averaging 21.3 points and 5.3 assists per game, in three games played. The Mobile Revelers, of the NBA Development League, selected Phillips in the first round (7th overall), in the 2001 NBDL Draft. He played the entire first season in NBDL history with the Revelers, while appearing in 53 total games (including 27 starts). He averaged 12.5 points and 3.7 assists per game, as Mobile finished with a 30‚Äì26 record, good for fourth place in the eight team league. The Revelers lost in the playoffs, two games to one, in a best-of- three format, to the North Charleston Lowgators. For the next seven years, Phillips became somewhat of a journeyman. He played in over eight leagues, both domestically and internationally, and rarely stayed with one team for more than a season. His stops included leagues in Australia, France, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. Three different times he was his league's scoring champion, and once was its MVP. He retired from playing professional basketball in 2010 after a stint with the Gie√üen 46ers.

It is classified as a 501(c) corporation. One of the main facets of FOG is Quality Certification Services, a program that extends through 30 states and 14 countries. FOG is also concerned with community outreach and education in order to promote healthy organic lifestyles and social equity.  History  Headquartered in Gainesville, Florida, FOG began as community farmers joining together to promote and ensure quality organic food and farming practices. In response to the Florida Organic Farming and Food Law of 1990 and the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990, FOG began a quality certification program in order to protect consumers and enforce consistent organic standards. US Code 7, ¬ß¬ß 6501-22 In 2001, FOG received their USDA accreditation, allowing it to certify organic farms. FOG also become involved in policy creation and promotion, including the National Organic Program and Farm Bill. More recently, FOG has expanded its interests to include teaching and research projects oriented towards sharing knowledge and resources to create a healthy and just food system. These projects span from involvement in local farmers' markets to the implementation of organic community and personal gardens in low-income areas.  Quality Certification Services  Florida Organic Growers adopted the name Quality Certification Services (QCS) for its organic certification initiative in 1996 to reflect its widespread clientele. QCS is aimed towards economizing organic certification and fostering diversity, as shown by its 400 member farms. As of 2001, FOG's Quality Certification Services can USDA certify farming, wildcrafting, livestock, processing, packing and handling operations. These products can be deemed as Certified Organic, Certified Transitional, Certified Hormone, Antibiotic Free, or Organic Aquaculture. These categories help farmers differentiate their products and allow consumers to make informed purchases.  Education and Outreach  = Farmers Markets/EBT = EBT Project In late 2010, FOG launched its Alachua County Farmers Markets EBT Project. EBT, or Electronic Benefit Transfer, cards are given by the government to members of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for the purpose of purchasing food and non-alcoholic beverages. Before the launch of FOG's EBT Project, there were not many places in Alachua county for people with these federal food benefits to purchase groceries besides standard supermarkets. FOG wanted to implement a method for those with food assistance to purchase fresh, local merchandise at Alachua county farmers' markets. As a result of FOG's EBT program, EBT cards can now be swiped at a FOG vendor booth stationed at various farmers markets for tokens that can be used within the market to purchase meat, produce, and edible plants. This project makes products at the farmers markets available to members of the food assistance program, offering these people more nutritious food options. In addition, the EBT project boosts the local economy by supporting Gainesville farmers and promotes local sustainable agriculture. The FOG booth is also an educational hub, offering resources on gardening, cooking, community events, and more. From February 2011 through September 2011, the FOG EBT Project offered double value coupons to those using their EBT cards at the Gainesville farmers markets, giving users $2 for every $1 swiped from their card. The funding for this aspect of the project was provided mostly by Alachua county. The double value promotion substantially increased awareness of the program and brought even more money into the local agriculture community. = Gift Gardens = Downtown Farmer's Garden A project of FOG's main outpost in Alachua County, Florida is the GIFT Gardens. GIFT Gardens‚ÄîGainesville's Initiative For Tasty Gardens‚Äîhave two facets. One entails providing low-income county residents with up to three vegetable garden beds and ample tools and information to maintain them. Allowing families the means to become more self-sufficient and supplement their food supplies upholds FOG's effort towards social justice, as inequity often parallels nutritional disparities. They also provide these services to community centers, such as churches, schools and recreation areas, which can receive up to ten garden beds. There are now over 200 GIFT gardens in Alachua County, all providing nutritious food, education and physical exercise for a healthier community. These gardens are funded by Alachua County and the City of Gainesville, although to supplement FOG offers 1-4-1 gardens, where people purchase personal gardens and the money is used to provide low income areas with a free GIFT garden. The other component of the GIFT gardens are the community gardens maintained by volunteers. These include the Downtown Farmers Garden, installed in July 2010, and the recent addition of the City Hall garden in May 2011. These gardens provide educational opportunities, and their harvests are donated to local charities and homeless shelters. = Grow Gainesville = In collaboration with Slow Food Gainesville, Abundant Edible Landscapes, the Edible Plant Project, Santa Fe College and The University of Florida, FOG is seeking an \\"urban gardening network,\\" in which they supply the means and information for people to grow food for themselves, while enhancing the aesthetics of the city. Grow Gainesville is a membership based organization, whose annual dues fund the operation of an urban garden network. The membership allows access to seeds, equipment and discounts on plants and supplemental materials. = Neighborhood Nutrition Network = The Neighborhood Nutrition Network is a nationally acknowledged food program that created gardens with student participation at three low income schools. The harvests were divided among their cafeterias and the students' families, amounting to over 4,000 pounds. The project was supported by the USDA Community Food Project grant, awarded in 2000 and 2003. The latter grant allowed the formation and proliferation of the Youth Entrepreneurial Farm and Food Preservation Project, employing at risk high school students at a local farm, giving them the experience to establish their own businesses. = Outreach = FOG also created the Organic Transition Project, an initiative that gives free technical aid to farmers dedicated to switching to organic production. Workshops provide farmers with information on organic farming practices, federal regulation, and farm development. FOG also discusses financial incentives offered to transitioning farmers, as included in the 2008 Farm Bill. = Social Justice = Since 1999, FOG has worked on the Agricultural Justice Project (AJP) to create a \\"socially just\\" food label. Such a certification reflects fair working conditions and economic equity, often ignored by standard organic labels. These labels are awarded to business that exemplify an open relationship between producer and consumer, while maintaining environmental and social integrity. To promote the project, FOG administers technical assistance and certification to qualifying farms and gives training to other certifiers, enabling them to verify deserving businesses. FOG also contributed to the formation of the Domestic Fair Trade Association, oriented towards \\"health, justice and sustainability.\\" They promote family-scale farming, direct trade, stable pricing, empowerment and transparency, achieved through education and assistance. They recognize that a method for evaluating the social and environmental implications of a business must be devised, and are working towards a sufficient criterion. = Research = FOG's main research was a 2009 to 2011 project entitled \\"Organic Perspectives: Understanding the Views of Florida Consumers, Specialty Crop Farmers and Retailers.\\" The report aimed at unveiling the most pervasive market influences on organic production as opposed to conventional methods, emphasizing attitudes and the consumer component. The research was funded by a grant through the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.

Ras Makonnen (c. 7 October 1909 - 18 December 1983, Nairobi) was a Guyanese-born, Pan-African financier and activist. Biography Makonnen was born George Thomas N. Griffiths in Buxton, Guyana. His paternal grandfather was reputedly born in Tigre, Ethiopia, and taken to British Guiana by a Scottish miner.Amon Saba Sakaana, \\"Makonnen, Ras\\", in David Dabydeen, John Gilmore, Cecily Jones (eds), The Oxford Companion to Black British History, Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 283. Makonnen completed his secondary school in Guyana, before leaving in 1927 to study mineralogy in Texas.\\"Ras Makonnen: True Pan-Africanist. An Appreciation: The Weekly Review (Nairobi), January 6, 1984\\", in During the Second Italo-Abyssinian War in 1935, he changed his name to emphasize his African roots. His children are T'Shai R. Makonnen, Desta Makonnen, Lorenzo Makonnen and Sheba Makonnen. =Move to America= In 1927, Makonnen went to Beaumont, Texas where he wanted to study mineralogy. Shortly after his arrival in Texas he was drawn into YMCA activities through which he developed his solidarity with the African cause and laid the foundation for his repute as a gifted speaker. A part-time involvement with the YMCA in soon became a full-time post, which included establishing services for the Black population of the town, including services to businessmen ‚Äì and even a brass band for the 60,000 Black workers of the Magnolia Petroleum Company. This resulted in speaking engagements around the US and attendance at YMCA international conferences. At one of these Griffith met Max Yergan, who had been a YMCA ‚Äòmissionary‚Äô in South Africa; this was likely Griffith's introduction to Africa. From Texas in 1932 Griffith went north, to Cornell University, where he briefly studied agriculture and worked in the library. Cornell's student body included a number of Ethiopians, with whom he discussed the looming Ethiopian crisis. It was at this time that Griffith changed his name to Makonnen. His holidays were spent in Harlem, New York City, where he participated in the agitation against high rents. He and his West Indian and African friends (including future Nigerian president Nnamdi Azikiwe) formed the Libyan Institute, where the members ‚Äòread learned papers on aspects of Africa‚Äô. He also listened on the street corners and at other meetings to Black socialists and communists, including George Padmore, ‚Äòbut never became a party man; [though] I borrowed a lot from them‚Äô. He also lent his energies to the Brookwood Labor College, working on ‚Äòa primer on American history and a dictionary of terms essential to the workers‚Äô movement‚Äô. Makonnen's reading, to judge by his memoirs, was broad; it is known, for example, that he and Kenyatta visited Jamaican-born Theophilus Scholes to thank him for the great stimulus they had derived from reading his books, which were critical studies of British imperialism and racism. Makonnen was actively engaged in the raging debates of those days on the comparative merits of the views of DuBois and Marcus Garvey. Makonnen's collaboration with George Padmore, then Malcolm Nurse; a nephew of Sylvester Williams, also dates from this period. At Cornell, he continued his activities as a champion of the cause of Black people. He learnt from men like the economist, Scott-Nearing and the anthropologist Franz Boas. His brief flirtation with the radical American left during this period, drew in his own words, jocular remarks from Azikiwe and Ugandan Ernest Kalibala, who were also in America around that time. A good number of his generation got their early political education from associations on the left of the political spectrum. =Move to Europe= In 1935, Makonnen moved to Europe. It was during a brief visit in London, en route to Denmark where he met and shared a platform with C.L.R James and Jomo Kenyatta at a meeting in Trafalgar Square on the Ethiopian crisis organised by the International African Friends of Ethiopia (IAFE). It was around this time that Mussolini unravelled his designs on Ethiopia that the young Griffiths changed his name to Makonnen, when he was part of a delegation, that included Jomo Kenyatta and ITA Wallace Johnson; to welcome Haile Selassie to the City of Bath. Together with people like Makonnen Desta, Peter Mbiyu Koinange, Workineh Martin and others, Makonnen worked to publicise the Ethiopian crisis. Makonnen went to the Royal Agricultural College in Copenhagen, Denmark. After about 18 months he was deported from Denmark for suggesting that the mustard sold by Denmark to Italy was being used in the manufacture of the mustard gas being used in Abyssinia. Italian invasion of Ethiopia. On the boat he met Paul Robeson, who had then left America and was establishing a name for himself at the Unity Theater in London. Makonnen subsequently settled in London in 1937. He became an active member of the International African Service Bureau that had formed under George Padmore's leadership. Writing about Makonnen's role in the Bureau, historian Carol Polsgrove presents him as the group's business manager, selling its journal, Pan Africa, at political meetings and handling the bills.Carol Polsgrove, Ending British Rule in Africa: Writers in a Common Cause (2009), pp. 26, 35-36. In London, Makonnen became a founder member of the first attempt to form a Pan-African Federation in mid-1936, which brought together representatives from North, South, East and West Africa, and the Caribbean. Makonnen naturally also became involved with the International African Friends of Abyssinia (IAFA), which was chaired by C.L.R. James; one of its leading members was Jomo Kenyatta. After the Italian conquest of Abyssinia, IAFA transformed itself into the International African Service Bureau (IASB), under the chairmanship of Padmore, with Makonnen as ‚Äòexecutive and publicity secretary‚Äô. Makonnen drafted the constitution. The IASB stood for ‚Äòthe progress and social advancement of Africans at home and abroad; full economic, political and racial equality; and for self-determination‚Äô. The Bureau aimed to ‚Äòco-ordinate and centralize‚Äô Black organisations around the world and link them ‚Äòin closer fraternal relations‚Äô with one another, and with ‚Äòsympathetic‚Äô White organisations. Membership of the IASB was restricted to Blacks, but Whites could become associate members. The office of the IASB, which was administered and funded through the efforts of Makonnen, was a ‚Äòregular mecca for all revolutionaries from all the colonies and a rendezvous for the Left‚Äô; it also provided a place to stay for colonials. ‚Äò[Makonnen] did a colossal job‚Äô, C.L.R. James wrote, ‚Äòhe cooked, and cleaned the place himself ‚Ä¶ [And] he was no mean agitator himself‚Äô. The IASB was in touch with colonial organisations such as the Gold Coast Aborigines Rights Protection Society, which solicited its support for its 1935 petition regarding monopolistic control of cocoa exports. It organised various protest meetings in Trafalgar Square and sent speakers, including Makonnen, as far afield as Belfast and Scotland. On the Sunday platforms at Speakers‚Äô Corner in Hyde Park, Makonnen and other IASB speakers drew a crowd by using Prince Monolulu - an early funder for the IASB - as the first speaker. Monolulu, who earned an occasionally lucrative living as a race-course tipster, had a ‚Äòkind of Rasputin tone [and] traded in subtle vulgarity of a high order‚Äô. Makonnen himself is described by Nkrumah as a ‚Äògifted speaker‚Äô. There, and at left-wing and other meetings, Makonnen assiduously sold the IASB's newspaper. After the outbreak of the Second World War Makonnen moved to Manchester, where he studied history at Manchester University. True to his entrepreneurial spirit, he opened four restaurants and an exclusive nightclub, all of which did exceptionally well, especially after the arrival of US, especially African American, troops in the area during the war. He also opened a bookshop which catered to the students at the nearby Manchester University, and eventually owned a number of houses which he let to Black people. The profits from these businesses went towards his political work. The most significant of these efforts was the Fifth Pan African Congress and the allied Pan Africa publication. His fraternity with Kwame Nkrumah, Peter Abrahams, N.A. Fadipe and DuBois also developed during this period He continued to be active in the International African Service Bureau (IASB) and, along with George Padmore and Nkrumah, helped organize the fifth Pan-African Congress in 1945. He also hosted visitors from Africa and opened a bookstore and a mail-order book service. In 1947 he started a new publication, Pan-Africa, which he hoped would be \\"a reflection of the everyday life and deeds of the African people\\". He distributed it across Africa and the Americas, but it was hard to collect fees, and in some places bookstores and subscribers were nervous about being seen with what was then, under colonial rule, a hard hitting publication that challenged the imposed authority of colonialism. The periodical ceased publication the year after it began.Polsgrove, Ending British Rule, pp. 80, 87-89. During the post war years, Makonnen worked with members of the Somali Youth League in Britain to improve Somali-Ethiopia relations. Makonnen was one of the last people to see Kenyatta before he left Britain to return to Kenya. Indeed, after Kenyatta's departure from Britain and years later when his arrest was imminent, Makonnen was questioned by the British MI-5 about his contacts with Kenyatta. Makonnen's political contacts and activities also included work with the Sudanese Umma Party and particular with men like Abdalla Khalil Bey and Mohammed Majoub. In July 1937 the Bureau had begun to publish a duplicated paper, Africa and the World, whose 14 August 1937 (and apparently final) issue noted that Makonnen had been among the speakers at a Trafalgar Square meeting regarding the situation in the West Indies, where there was widespread agitation for civil and trade union rights. He also spoke to peace groups, on socialist labour platforms, and to the Left Book Club. By 1938 seemingly enough money had been raised not only to publish a printed monthly paper, International African Opinion (IAO) but also a number of pamphlets which were sold in Britain and sent surreptitiously overseas to colleagues in the West Indies and East and West Africa. In its February‚ÄìMarch 1939 issue the IAO published an article by Makonnen entitled ‚ÄòA plea for Negro self-government‚Äô, which analysed the economic motives for the subjection and exploitation of Black peoples everywhere and advised ‚ÄòAfrican peoples of the West to aim in political philosophy and corresponding action at the establishment of the complete economic, social and political control of their own destinies‚Äô. The IAO was soon banned in East Africa and probably elsewhere in the British colonies. The life of IAO was as brief as that of its predecessor: the final issue was published in February‚ÄìMarch 1939. However, the IASB did not cease publishing: the treasurer raised enough money to continue publishing pamphlets, whose authors included Kenyatta and Eric Williams. Makonnen served as an advisory editor. Makonnen also furthered his interests in the cooperative movement by studying at the Co-operative College in 1939‚Äì40 and lecturing on the movement to local organisations. For a while he was also a student at Manchester University taking a course in British history. He then also became an active member of the local Labour Party and was even invited to speak at the prestigious County Forum, where his talk on ‚ÄòThe Myth of Empire‚Äô must have evoked some criticism. At about this time he formed the African Co-operative League with Sierra Leonean Laminah Sankoh, which he wanted to link ‚Äòwith our traditional African form of co-operation‚Äô, in the hope of replacing purely exploitative, capitalist enterprise among Africans. The Pan-African Federation (PAF) was re-formed in Manchester in 1944 under the presidency of Dr Peter Milliard, a politically active physician of British Guianese origins; Makonnen was the secretary. The PAF organised a Pan- African Congress, convened in Manchester in July 1945, with delegates and representatives from the Black world. The principal political organiser of the Congress was George Padmore, assisted by the recently arrived Francis (Kwame) Nkrumah. In order to maintain continuity with previous Congresses, W.E.B. DuBois, who had called four of them, was invited to chair the Manchester Congress. ‚ÄòOne important thing that came out of the Congress‚Äô, Makonnen believed, was ‚Äòthat the struggle was not to be found in Europe for the majority of us. The old idea that you could do more work for liberation outside Africa was being laid aside‚Äô. (Pan-Africanism from Within, p. 168) Both Nkrumah and Kenyatta were soon to return to Africa. At the Congress Makonnen had spoken about Ethiopia, attacking British policies which he claimed were aimed at dismembering Ethiopia in order to both enlarge the British empire and restore some sovereignty there to Italy to enable Italy to repay a British loan. In mid-1946 Makonnen began to advertise the ‚ÄòPanaf Service‚Äô as ‚Äòimporters and exporters, publishers, booksellers, printers, and manufacturers‚Äô representatives‚Äô, based at his premises at 58 Oxford Road, Manchester, which was also the PAF's home. Profits from these new activities went to finance the PAF, which maintained old contacts and made new ones with political groups and activists in Africa and the Caribbean whose concerns were publicised and whose delegations to Britain were helped when possible. The PAF attempted to break down ‚Äòclannish‚Äô and tribal divisions both in Britain and Africa, which Makonnen felt were ‚Äòobstacles to pan-Africanism‚Äô (ibid., p. 190). It also organised many political meetings, for example criticising the British government's non-cooperation with the UN's attempts to introduce democracy to the colonies, supporting the 1945 strike in Nigeria and celebrating the centenary of Liberian independence. The PAF set up an Asiatic- African United Front Committee to foster cooperation between all ‚Äòsubject peoples‚Äô and attempted to set up a Pan-African Committee in Paris. The PAF Secretary, after holding a meeting on the issue and consulting widely (for example with Kobina Sekyi of the Aborigines‚Äô Rights Protection Society in the Gold Coast, with whom Makonnen and the PAF had a long relationship), sent a memorandum to the United Nations about the appointment of Barbadian Grantley Adams to the Trusteeship Council. Adams had recently publicly defended British imperialism. Makonnen questioned the UN about the appointment, as ‚Äòcolonial people‚Äô had not been consulted about it; and Adams had not consulted them about the stance he should take on issues affecting them. The PAF also got involved in the ever-increasing racial incidents in the UK. For example, it ‚Äì or Makonnen ‚Äì stood bail for Black seamen accused of mutiny in Plymouth. As the PAF had little faith in White British barristers, in 1946 it raised the funds to bring the eminent Jamaican Norman Manley to Britain to defend a Jamaican airman accused of murder. (The man was acquitted.) In 1948 it demanded a government investigation of the racial riots which had taken place in Liverpool. Makonnen himself corresponded with the city's mayor and obtained an interview with the chief constable. Always using his profits to help his fellow Blacks, Makonnen gave ¬£5,000 to the founding of a home for the abandoned children fathered by Black servicemen with White women who did not want to keep their ‚Äòcoloured‚Äô babies. Makonnen maintained his involvement with Ethiopia which had begun with the campaigns against the 1935 invasion. He had helped to organise the exiled Emperor Menelik's retinue. Post-war, he raised funds for the Princess Tsehai Memorial Hospital. In 1946 the PAF questioned the British government over the unkept promises which had been made to Ethiopia, and Makonnen supported the pro-Ethiopia campaigns organised by Sylvia Pankhurst, for example for the restoration of Eritrea and Somalia to Ethiopia. At this 19 June meeting he argued that the problems of Africa were ‚Äòattributable to Europe‚Äôs master-race principle‚Äô. In 1947 Makonnen began to publish a journal, Pan-Africa, a ‚Äòmonthly journal of African life, history and thought‚Äô. He was its publisher and managing editor; the editor was Dinah Stock; Padmore, Kenyatta and Nkrumah were among the associate and contributing editors. The journal sought and attracted articles from and readership in the colonised world as well as the USA. By October 1947 the Belgian Government banned the journal from the ‚ÄòBelgian‚Äô Congo; within another few months it was banned by the East African colonial governments as seditious. This loss of readership resulted in the journal's demise in early 1948. Though no copies have remained, it appears that the journal also published news-releases (which reached, for example, the Gold Coast) and a copy of the petition to the United Nations, ‚ÄòStatement on the Denial of Human Rights to Minorities in the Case of Citizens of Negro Descent in the USA‚Äô. The journal, also funded by Makonnen, was ‚Äì naturally ‚Äì based at 58 Oxford Road. Having ‚Äòno ties with Guyana‚Äô, and as ‚Äòall my travelling ‚Ä¶ was to get knowledge to prepare me for working in the West Indies or Africa‚Äô, =Move to Africa= In 1957 Makonnen emigrated to Ghana. As he had been very critical of Nkrumah in 1948, because of Nkrumah's pro-communist associates in London, this move either indicated a change of perception, or hopes induced by Padmore's presence there. Makonnen joined Nkrumah and Padmore there and helped to found the Organization of African Unity. Initially in Ghana, he worked with Padmore as an Adviser on African Affairs, subsequently moving to the newly established African Affairs Center as Director. It was in this capacity that he came into contact with Jomo, Lumumba, Kaunda, Roberto, Banda and other leaders of African opinion. He was arrested following a coup in Ghana in 1966 and spent time in prison before his release was secured by Kenyatta, who had been an IASB colleague in Britain. Makonnen then worked for the Kenyan Ministry of Tourism and became a citizen of Kenya in 1969. In Kenya, Makonnen offered counsel and comfort to the South African community exiled there and forged friendships with men like Raboroko, a founding member of PAC and members of the ANC Kenneth King, a professor at the University of Nairobi, interviewed Makonnen over nine months and organized the content of the interviews into a book that described Makonnen's political life, Pan-Africanism from Within (1973).Polsgrove, Ending British Rule, pp. 166-167. In his final years Makonnen became increasingly perturbed with the general results of independence, especially African unity, which remained elusive. Too often he felt that excessive materialism, pomp and circumstance had become overriding preoccupations of independent Africa. Makonnen died in Nairobi in 1983. Bibliography * *Polsgrove, Carol.

History Delicious Orchards began in 1911 as a small orchard located on a farm road (present day CR 537), connecting Colts Neck with Freehold. The Applegate family, of Freehold Township, bought the orchard in 1922, having three generations of the family run the farm. The orchard eventually grew to 110 acres throughout the years. In the 1950s, Carroll W. Barclay, the son of the original owners, took over the operation of the farm. He altered the concept of the business from being strictly wholesale to a combination of retail. In 1959, Barclay hauled several wagonloads of apples to the roadside and set up a makeshift stand. This concept was a success, and in 1960, a stand was built, which led to modern day Delicious Orchards. Carolyn Barclay Smith and her husband William E. Smith joined their brother Carroll and ran the store and farm for nearly 25 years . They shared the dedication to quality which was the foundation of the business . Product lines were expanded to include fresh apple cider and his wife Janet's apple pie. Several varieties of apples were grown and hand-picked for the best flavor at their peak season. In the 1960s, the Barclay's transitioned to a year-round business with the addition of more produce and baked goods. In 1966, the Barclay's bought a building on Route 34 at the current location of Delicious Orchards. Having the business indoors created some additions to the product line, including citrus fruits and cheeses. The farm today Over 2.5 million people visit Delicious Orchards annually. As of 2011, the farm has 250 employees, with 300 employed during the fall. Patrons have a variety of fresh foods from several departments of Delicious Orchards. These include produce, deli, bakery, coffee and tea, seafood, smoothie/juice bar, prepared foods, organic foods, and candy. Their services also include, personalized gift baskets, catering, and curbside service. Delicious Orchards is now owned and operated by Bill and Linda McDonald along with their four children Keri, Chris, Mike and Erin.

He recorded 21 songs in Kannada for the composer Upendra Kumar in Bengaluru from 9 am to 9 pm on 8 February 1981. In addition, he recorded 19 songs in Tamil and 16 songs in Hindi in a day, which has also been called a record.

He was a recipient of the Padma Shri (2001) and Padma Bhushan (2011) from the Government of India. On 25 September 2020, he died in Chennai from post COVID-19 complications.  Early life and background  SP Balasubrahmanyam at Kanithan Audio Launch S. P. Balasubrahmanyam was born in Nellore, Madras Presidency (present-day Andhra Pradesh) into a Telugu Brahmin family. His father, S. P. Sambamurthy, was a Harikatha artist who also acted in plays. His mother was Sakunthalamma, who died on 4 February 2019. He had two brothers and five sisters, including singer S. P. Sailaja. His son S. P. Charan is also a popular South Indian singer, actor and producer. Balasubrahmanyam developed an interest in music at an early age, studied musical notations, and learned music. He enrolled at the JNTU College of Engineering Anantapur with the intention of becoming an engineer. He discontinued his studies early due to typhoid and joined as an associate member the Institution of Engineers, Chennai. Balasubrahmanyam continued to pursue music during his engineering studies and won awards at singing competitions. In 1964, he won the first prize in a music competition for amateur singers organized by the Madras-based Telugu Cultural Organization. He was the leader of a light music troupe composed of Anirutta (on the harmonium), Ilaiyaraaja (on guitar and later on harmonium), Baskar (on percussion) and Gangai Amaran (on guitar).Dinathanthi, Nellai Edition, 11 August 2006, p. 11. He was selected as the best singer in a singing competition which was judged by S. P. Kodandapani and Ghantasala. Often visiting music composers seeking opportunities, his first audition song was \\"Nilave Ennidam Nerungadhe\\". It was rendered by veteran playback singer P. B.

Yesudas Balasubrahmanyam made his debut as a playback singer on 15 December 1966 with Sri Sri Sri Maryada Ramanna, a Telugu film scored by his mentor, S. P. Kodandapani. The first non-Telugu song that he recorded just eight days after his debut Telugu song was in Kannada in 1966 for the film Nakkare Ade Swarga, starring Kannada comedy stalwart T. R. Narasimharaju. He recorded his first Tamil song \\"Athaanodu Ippadi Irundhu Eththanai Naalaachu\\", a duet with L. R. Eswari under the musical direction of M. S. Viswanathan for the film Hotel Ramba, which was never released. Other early songs he sang were duets with P. Susheela, \\"Iyarkai Ennum Ilaya Kanni\\" in the 1969 film Shanti Nilayam, starring Gemini Ganesh, and \\"Aayiram Nilavae Vaa\\" for M. G. Ramachandran in Adimaippenn. His first song with S. Janaki was \\"Pournami Nilavil Pani Vizhum Iravil\\" in Kannippenn. He was then introduced to the Malayalam film industry by G. Devarajan in the film Kadalppalam. Balasubrahmanyam had the distinction of rendering the most songs on a single day by any singer. He had recorded 21 songs in Kannada for the composer Upendra Kumar in Bangalore from 9:00 am to 9:00 pm on 8 February 1981 and 19 songs in Tamil, 16 songs in Hindi in a day. In his words, \\"There were days when I used to record 15‚Äì20 songs, but only for Anand-Milind. And I would take the last flight back to Chennai.\\" In the 1970s, he also worked with M. S. Viswanathan in Tamil movies for actors such as M. G. Ramachandran, Sivaji Ganesan and Gemini Ganesan. He recorded duets with P. Susheela, S. Janaki, Vani Jayaram and L. R. Eswari. Balasubrahmanyam's association with Ilaiyaraaja began even before Ilaiyaraaja came to the cine field. In the early days, he used to sing in towns and villages all over south India and Ilaiyaraaja, then an unknown harmonium and guitar player accompanied him in his concerts. = 1980s = Balasubrahmanyam pictured in 1985 Balasubrahmanyam came to international prominence with the 1980 film Sankarabharanam. The film is considered to be one of the best films ever to emerge from the Telugu film industry. Directed by K. Vishwanath, the film's soundtrack was composed by K.V. Mahadevan, and led to an increase in the usage of Carnatic music in Telugu cinema. Not a classically trained singer, he used a \\"film music\\" aesthetic in recording the songs. Balasubrahmanyam received his first National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer for his work. His first work in Hindi films was in the following year, in Ek Duuje Ke Liye (1981), for which he received another National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer. Balasubrahmanyam began to record more songs in Tamil and Telugu, especially for Ilaiyaraaja with S. Janaki, the trio considered to be highly successful in the Telugu film industry from the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s. The songs were based on classical music, such as in Saagara Sangamam (1983) and Rudraveena (1988), for which both Ilaiyaraaja and Balasubrahmanyam won National Awards for Best Music Director and Best Male Playback Singer respectively. In 1989, Balasubrahmanyam was the playback singer for actor Salman Khan in the blockbuster Maine Pyar Kiya. The soundtrack for the film was very successful and he won a Filmfare Award for Best Male Playback Singer for the song Dil Deewana. For much of the next decade, Balasubrahmanyam continued as the \\"romantic singing voice\\" on the soundtracks of Khan's films. Notable among these was Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! which became the highest-grossing Hindi film of all time. Balasubrahmanyam's duet with Lata Mangeshkar, \\"Didi Tera Devar Deewana\\", was very popular. This solidified Balasubrahmanyam as one of the biggest playback singers in India. SP Balasubrahmanyam became identified as Salman Khan's voice in the 90s just like Kishore Kumar became Rajesh Khanna‚Äôs voice through the 70s. = 1990s = Celebrating 50 years of musical journey of S.

Rajkumar and Deva among others, but his association with A.R.Rahman turned out be a major success. Balasubrahmanyam recorded three songs for A. R. Rahman in the latter's debut film Roja. He had a long-time association with Rahman right from Roja. Other popular songs include \\"July Maadham\\" from Pudhiya Mugam, which also marked the debut of singer Anupama, \\"Mannoothu Manthayilae\\" from Kizhakku Cheemayile which was a folk number and he almost sang all songs in the musical love story Duet and \\"Thanga Thaamarai\\" from Minsara Kanavu which fetched him, the sixth and latest of his National Film Awards for Best Male Playback Singer to date. Balasubrahmanyam's association with Hamsalekha began after the latter's successful venture Premaloka in Kannada. Balasubrahmanyam sang the most songs for Hamsalekha in Kannada. He received his fourth National Film Award for Best Male Playback Singer for the song \\"Umandu Ghumandu\\" from the Kannada film Ganayogi Panchakshari Gavayi (1995), which was a Hindustani classical music- based composition by Hamsalekha. = 2000s‚Äì2020 = SPB performing in Singapore in 2017 while on world tour titled SPB 50 to commemorate 50 years of his singing career.

In 48 BC he is supposed to have enabled Cleopatra to get in the palace of Alexandria to Julius Caesar and in this way to strengthen decisively her position in the power struggle with her brother Ptolemy XIII.  Life  When Caesar came to Alexandria in the summer of 48 BC he summoned the estranged Ptolemaic brother and sister to submit to his decision. Ptolemy XIII was at this time with his army at the Egyptian border near Pelusium opposite the troops of Cleopatra. He was first to go to Caesar. Cleopatra first sent negotiators to explain her point of view but, according to the historian Cassius Dio, she soon became convinced that if she came personally she could more easily win the Roman ruler over by her charm and beauty. Caesar promised her a confidential conversation.Cassius Dio, Roman History 42.34.3-6 Apparently Ptolemy XIII tried to block his sister's access to Alexandria. Plutarch gives an account of her adventurous journey to the Egyptian capital. According to this report she chose from her retinue only one follower, Apollodorus the Sicilian,Plutarch, Caesar 49.1 and travelled with him to Alexandria. The Roman poet Lucan claims, that when Cleopatra arrived near the city she bribed a guardian to remove the defensive chains in the harbour of Pharus.Lucan, Pharsalia 10.56-57 (Livy is probably the source of Lucan). In any case she entered the harbour of Alexandria by sea, because both Plutarch and Lucan say that she landed unobserved with her barque near the royal palace.Plutarch, Caesar 49.1; Lucan, Pharsalia 10.57-58 According to Plutarch this happened in the twilight, and the Greek biographer adds that Cleopatra thought that her only chance to get to Caesar was to stretch herself at full length inside a bed-sack or carpet while Apollodorus tied it up with a cord and carried it past the guardians into the palace. The Egyptian Queen allegedly succeeded in that way in reaching the Roman general and in winning him over with this bold action.Plutarch, Caesar 49.2-3; compare Cassius Dio, Roman History 42.34.6‚Äì35.1 The credibility of this episode is disputed among scholars. But it is certain that Cleopatra gained Caesar‚Äôs support by her personal appearance. Nothing else is known about Apollodorus. In media *The role of Apollodorus is played by Cesare Danova in the 1963 epic, Cleopatra. *In the 1945 film Caesar and Cleopatra, based on the play by George Bernard Shaw, he is played by Stewart Granger, and is depicted as being somewhat in love with Cleopatra. *He was played in the first television adaptation of the play by Farley Granger (no relation), and in the second TV adaptation by Clive Francis. *In the 2017 video game, Assassin's Creed Origins, Apollodorus is portrayed by actor Gerald Kyd, and is instrumental in managing a network of pro-Cleopatra spies and informants spread across Egypt. He is portrayed as an ally of the protagonist, Bayek.  Notes   References  * Michael Grant: Kleopatra. German Bergisch Gladbach 1998, , pp. 92‚Äì93. *Christoph Sch√§fer: Kleopatra.

It is the only private organization in the United States that preserves rare livestock by gathering and storing both semen and embryos of the animals in its collection, a technique called cryopreservation. History and facilities Early twentieth century view of Surprise Valley Farm buildings, which now house facilities devoted to cryopreservation SVF, which stands for \\"Swiss Village Farm\\", is located in Newport, Rhode Island, and has facilities both for housing live herds and for cryopreservation on its 45 acres. Live animals are also available for sale to farmers and ranchers to increase the practical use of rare breeds in modern agriculture. It is not open to the public except for one day a year, as a strict biosecurity measure. SVF was founded by Dorrance Hill Hamilton, the billionaire heir to the Campbell Soup Company fortune and one of the wealthiest Americans according to Forbes. The Newport property on which it is housed was built by railroad magnate Arthur Curtiss James in the early 1900s and was purchased by Hamilton in 1998. Preservation work Likened to an \\"animal seed bank\\", the foundation had about 45,000 samples of germplasm from sheep, goats, and cattle as of 2010. Much of the cryopreservation work at SVF Foundation is accomplished with the help of the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University, and a Tufts veterinarian is the foundation's chief scientist. This work began in 1999, and in 2004, the Foundation had its first successful birth of a preserved rare-breed embryo -- a Tennessee fainting goat -- by a host mother of a different breed.

The plaza also features \\"The Forum\\", or amphitheater‚Äîa space for public gatherings and performances. A portion of San Pablo Avenue which runs along the north side of the plaza has been pedestrianized and incorporated into the plaza, along with the blocks of 15th Street on either side of the plaza.

The plaza is adjacent to the Oakland City Center complex, directly across 14th Street to the south. Latham Square, a small plaza where Telegraph Avenue converges with Broadway, is one block to the northeast.

A Transatlantic Argument\\", L‚ÄôAnn√©e sociologique 1/2012 (Vol. 62), p. 93-122 . where it is distinguished from cultural anthropology. In the United States, social anthropology is commonly subsumed within cultural anthropology or sociocultural anthropology. Comparison with cultural anthropology The term cultural anthropology is generally applied to ethnographic works that are holistic in spirit, oriented to the ways in which culture affects individual experience, or aim to provide a rounded view of the knowledge, customs, and institutions of a people. Social anthropology is a term applied to ethnographic works that attempt to isolate a particular system of social relations such as those that comprise domestic life, economy, law, politics, or religion, give analytical priority to the organizational bases of social life, and attend to cultural phenomena as somewhat secondary to the main issues of social scientific inquiry. Academic blog post explaining the similarities/differences between social and cultural anthropology. Topics of interest for social anthropologists have included customs, economic and political organization, law and conflict resolution, patterns of consumption and exchange, kinship and family structure, gender relations, childbearing and socialization, religion, while present-day social anthropologists are also concerned with issues of globalism, ethnic violence, gender studies, transnationalism and local experience, and the emerging cultures of cyberspace, and can also help with bringing opponents together when environmental concerns come into conflict with economic developments.Hendry, Joy.1999. An Introduction to Social Anthropology: Other People's Worlds. London: Macmillan Press Ltd British and American anthropologists including Gillian Tett and Karen Ho who studied Wall Street provided an alternative explanation for the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010 to the technical explanations rooted in economic and political theory.Ho, Karen (2009): \\"Disciplining Investment Bankers, Disciplining the Economy: Wall Street‚Äôs Institutional Culture of Crisis and the Downsizing of American Corporations.\\"¬ù American Anthropologist, Vol. 111, No. 2. Differences among British, French, and American sociocultural anthropologies have diminished with increasing dialogue and borrowing of both theory and methods. Social and cultural anthropologists, and some who integrate the two, are found in most institutes of anthropology. Thus the formal names of institutional units no longer necessarily reflect fully the content of the disciplines these cover. Some, such as the Institute of Social and Cultural Anthropology (Oxford) changed their name to reflect the change in composition, others, such as Social Anthropology at the University of Kent became simply Anthropology. Most retain the name under which they were founded. Long-term qualitative research, including intensive field studies (emphasizing participant observation methods), has been traditionally encouraged in social anthropology rather than quantitative analysis of surveys, questionnaires and brief field visits typically used by economists, political scientists, and (most) sociologists.Bernard, R. 2006. Research Methods in Anthropology. Lanham: Alta Mira Press  Focus and practice  Social anthropology is distinguished from subjects such as economics or political science by its holistic range and the attention it gives to the comparative diversity of societies and cultures across the world, and the capacity this gives the discipline to re-examine Euro-American assumptions. It is differentiated from sociology, both in its main methods (based on long-term participant observation and linguistic competence),\\"Nanjunda, D.C.(2010) Contemporary Studies in Anthropology: a reading.

Anthropology Today, 1:6:15-16 Many social anthropologists use quantitative methods, too, particularly those whose research touches on topics such as local economies, demography, human ecology, cognition, or health and illness. =Specializations= Specializations within social anthropology shift as its objects of study are transformed and as new intellectual paradigms appear; musicology and medical anthropology are examples of current, well-defined specialities. More recent and currently cognitive development; social and ethical understandings of novel technologies; emergent forms of \\"the family\\" and other new socialities modelled on kinship; the ongoing social fall-out of the demise of state socialism; the politics of resurgent religiosity; and analysis of audit cultures and accountability. The subject has been enlivened by, and has contributed to, approaches from other disciplines, such as philosophy (ethics, phenomenology, logic), the history of science, psychoanalysis, and linguistics. =Ethical considerations= The subject has both ethical and reflexive dimensions. Practitioners have developed an awareness of the sense in which scholars create their objects of study and the ways in which anthropologists themselves may contribute to processes of change in the societies they study. An example of this is the \\"hawthorne effect\\", whereby those being studied may alter their behaviour in response to the knowledge that they are being watched and studied. History Social anthropology has historical roots in a number of 19th-century disciplines, including ethnology, folklore studies, and Classics, among others. (See History of anthropology.) Its immediate precursor took shape in the work of Edward Burnett Tylor and James George Frazer in the late 19th century and underwent major changes in both method and theory during the period 1890-1920 with a new emphasis on original fieldwork, long-term holistic study of social behavior in natural settings, and the introduction of French and German social theory. Bronislaw Malinowski, one of the most important influences on British social anthropology, emphasized long-term fieldwork in which anthropologists work in the vernacular and immerse themselves in the daily practices of local people. This development was bolstered by Franz Boas's introduction of cultural relativism arguing that cultures are based on different ideas about the world and can therefore only be properly understood in terms of their own standards and values.Hendry, Joy.1999. An Introduction to Social Anthropology: Other People's Worlds. Palgrave. p. 9-10. The British Museum, London Museums such as the British Museum weren't the only site of anthropological studies: with the New Imperialism period, starting in the 1870s, zoos became unattended \\"laboratories\\", especially the so-called \\"ethnological exhibitions\\" or \\"Negro villages\\". Thus, \\"savages\\" from the colonies were displayed, often nude, in cages, in what has been called \\"human zoos\\". For example, in 1906, Congolese pygmy Ota Benga was put by anthropologist Madison Grant in a cage in the Bronx Zoo, labelled \\"the missing link\\" between an orangutan and the \\"white race\\" -- Grant, a renowned eugenicist, was also the author of The Passing of the Great Race (1916). Such exhibitions were attempts to illustrate and prove in the same movement the validity of scientific racism, whose first formulation may be found in Arthur de Gobineau's An Essay on the Inequality of Human Races (1853‚Äì55). In 1931, the Colonial Exhibition in Paris still displayed Kanaks from New Caledonia in the \\"indigenous village\\"; it received 24 million visitors in six months, thus demonstrating the popularity of such \\"human zoos\\". Anthropology grew increasingly distinct from natural history and by the end of the 19th century the discipline began to crystallize into its modern form - by 1935, for example, it was possible for T.K. Penniman to write a history of the discipline entitled A Hundred Years of Anthropology. At the time, the field was dominated by \\"the comparative method\\". It was assumed that all societies passed through a single evolutionary process from the most primitive to most advanced. Non-European societies were thus seen as evolutionary \\"living fossils\\" that could be studied in order to understand the European past. Scholars wrote histories of prehistoric migrations which were sometimes valuable but often also fanciful. It was during this time that Europeans first accurately traced Polynesian migrations across the Pacific Ocean for instance - although some of them believed it originated in Egypt. Finally, the concept of race was actively discussed as a way to classify - and rank - human beings based on difference. =Tylor and Frazer= E.B. Tylor, 19th-century British anthropologist E.B. Tylor (2 October 1832 ‚Äì 2 January 1917) and James George Frazer (1 January 1854 ‚Äì 7 May 1941) are generally considered the antecedents to modern social anthropologists in Britain. Although Tylor undertook a field trip to Mexico, both he and Frazer derived most of the material for their comparative studies through extensive reading, not fieldwork, mainly the Classics (literature and history of Greece and Rome), the work of the early European folklorists, and reports from missionaries, travelers, and contemporaneous ethnologists. Tylor advocated strongly for unilinealism and a form of \\"uniformity of mankind\\".Stocking, George Jir. (1963) \\"Matthew Arnold, E. B. Tylor, and the Uses of Invention,\\" American Anthropologist, 65:783-799, 1963 Tylor in particular laid the groundwork for theories of cultural diffusionism, stating that there are three ways that different groups can have similar cultural forms or technologies: \\"independent invention, inheritance from ancestors in a distant region, transmission from one race to another.\\"Tylor, E.B. (1865) Researches into the early history of mankind the development of civilization. London: John Murray. Tylor formulated one of the early and influential anthropological conceptions of culture as \\"that complex whole, which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by [humans] as [members] of society.\\"Tylor, E.B. (1871) Primitive culture: researches into the development of mythology, philosophy, religion, art, and custom. 2 vols. London: John Murray. However, as Stocking notes, Tylor mainly concerned himself with describing and mapping the distribution of particular elements of culture, rather than with the larger function, and he generally seemed to assume a Victorian idea of progress rather than the idea of non- directional, multilineal cultural change proposed by later anthropologists. Tylor also theorized about the origins of religious beliefs in human beings, proposing a theory of animism as the earliest stage, and noting that \\"religion\\" has many components, of which he believed the most important to be belief in supernatural beings (as opposed to moral systems, cosmology, etc.). Frazer, a Scottish scholar with a broad knowledge of Classics, also concerned himself with religion, myth, and magic. His comparative studies, most influentially in the numerous editions of The Golden Bough, analyzed similarities in religious belief and symbolism globally. Neither Tylor nor Frazer, however, were particularly interested in fieldwork, nor were they interested in examining how the cultural elements and institutions fit together. The Golden Bough was abridged drastically in subsequent editions after his first. =Malinowski and the British School= Bronislaw Malinowski, Anthropologist at the London School of Economics Toward the turn of the 20th century, a number of anthropologists became dissatisfied with this categorization of cultural elements; historical reconstructions also came to seem increasingly speculative to them. Under the influence of several younger scholars, a new approach came to predominate among British anthropologists, concerned with analyzing how societies held together in the present (synchronic analysis, rather than diachronic or historical analysis), and emphasizing long-term (one to several years) immersion fieldwork. Cambridge University financed a multidisciplinary expedition to the Torres Strait Islands in 1898, organized by Alfred Cort Haddon and including a physician- anthropologist, William Rivers, as well as a linguist, a botanist, and other specialists. The findings of the expedition set new standards for ethnographic description. A decade and a half later, the Polish anthropology student, Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski (1884‚Äì1942), was beginning what he expected to be a brief period of fieldwork in the old model, collecting lists of cultural items, when the outbreak of the First World War stranded him in New Guinea. As a subject of the Austro-Hungarian Empire resident on a British colonial possession, he was effectively confined to New Guinea for several years.Malinowski, Bronis≈Çaw (1967) A diary in the strict sense of the term. New York, Harcourt, Brace & World [1967] He made use of the time by undertaking far more intensive fieldwork than had been done by anthropologists, and his classic ethnography, Argonauts of the Western Pacific (1922) advocated an approach to fieldwork that became standard in the field: getting \\"the native's point of view\\" through participant observation. Theoretically, he advocated a functionalist interpretation, which examined how social institutions functioned to satisfy individual needs. =1920s‚Äì1940= The main LSE entrance Modern social anthropology was founded in Britain at the London School of Economics and Political Science following World War I. Influences include both the methodological revolution pioneered by Bronis≈Çaw Malinowski's process-oriented fieldwork in the Trobriand Islands of Melanesia between 1915 and 1918Malinowski, B. (1922). Argonauts of the Western Pacific: An account of native enterprise and adventure in the Archipelagoes of Melanesian New Guinea. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul. and Alfred Radcliffe-Brown's theoretical program for systematic comparison that was based on a conception of rigorous fieldwork and the structure-functionalist conception of Durkheim‚Äôs sociology.Jack Goody (1995) The Expansive Moment: The Rise of Social Anthropology in Britain and Africa, 1918-1970 review at Barth, Fredrik, et al. (2005) One Discipline, Four Ways: British, German, French, and American anthropology. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Other intellectual founders include W. H. R. Rivers and A. C. Haddon, whose orientation reflected the contemporary Parapsychologies of Wilhelm Wundt and Adolf Bastian, and Sir E. B. Tylor, who defined anthropology as a positivist science following Auguste Comte. Edmund Leach (1962) defined social anthropology as a kind of comparative micro-sociology based on intensive fieldwork studies. Scholars have not settled a theoretical orthodoxy on the nature of science and society, and their tensions reflect views which are seriously opposed. Alfred R. Radcliffe-Brown A. R. Radcliffe-Brown also published a seminal work in 1922. He had carried out his initial fieldwork in the Andaman Islands in the old style of historical reconstruction. However, after reading the work of French sociologists √âmile Durkheim and Marcel Mauss, Radcliffe-Brown published an account of his research (entitled simply The Andaman Islanders) that paid close attention to the meaning and purpose of rituals and myths. Over time, he developed an approach known as structural functionalism, which focused on how institutions in societies worked to balance out or create an equilibrium in the social system to keep it functioning harmoniously. (This contrasted with Malinowski's functionalism, and was quite different from the later French structuralism, which examined the conceptual structures in language and symbolism.) Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown's influence stemmed from the fact that they, like Boas, actively trained students and aggressively built up institutions that furthered their programmatic ambitions. This was particularly the case with Radcliffe-Brown, who spread his agenda for \\"Social Anthropology\\" by teaching at universities across the British Empire and Commonwealth. From the late 1930s until the postwar period appeared a string of monographs and edited volumes that cemented the paradigm of British Social Anthropology (BSA). Famous ethnographies include The Nuer, by Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard, and The Dynamics of Clanship Among the Tallensi, by Meyer Fortes; well-known edited volumes include African Systems of Kinship and Marriage and African Political Systems. = Post-World War II trends = Following World War II, sociocultural anthropology as comprised by the fields of ethnography and ethnology diverged into an American school of cultural anthropology while social anthropology diversified in Europe by challenging the principles of structure-functionalism, absorbing ideas from Claude L√©vi- Strauss's structuralism and from the followers of Max Gluckman, and embracing the study of conflict, change, urban anthropology, and networks. Together with many of his colleagues at the Rhodes-Livingstone Institute and students at Manchester University, collectively known as the Manchester School, took BSA in new directions through their introduction of explicitly Marxist-informed theory, their emphasis on conflicts and conflict resolution, and their attention to the ways in which individuals negotiate and make use of the social structural possibilities. During this period Gluckman was also involved in a dispute with American anthropologist Paul Bohannan on ethnographic methodology within the anthropological study of law. He believed that indigenous terms used in ethnographic data should be translated into Anglo- American legal terms for the benefit of the reader.Moore, Sally F. 1966. Comparative Studies: Introduction. in Law in Culture and Society, edited by Laura Nader. London: University of California Press.Erickson,P.A. and Murphy, L.D. (2008) A History of Anthropological Theory, Toronto: Broadview Press The Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth was founded in 1946. In Britain, anthropology had a great intellectual impact, it \\"contributed to the erosion of Christianity, the growth of cultural relativism, an awareness of the survival of the primitive in modern life, and the replacement of diachronic modes of analysis with synchronic, all of which are central to modern culture.\\"Heyck, Thomas William (1997) at The American Historical Review, Vol. 102, No. 5 (December, 1997), pp. 1486-1488 Later in the 1960s and 1970s, Edmund Leach and his students Mary Douglas and Nur Yalman, among others, introduced French structuralism in the style of L√©vi- Strauss. In countries of the British Commonwealth, social anthropology has often been institutionally separate from physical anthropology and primatology, which may be connected with departments of biology or zoology; and from archaeology, which may be connected with departments of Classics, Egyptology, and the like. In other countries (and in some, particularly smaller, British and North American universities), anthropologists have also found themselves institutionally linked with scholars of folklore, museum studies, human geography, sociology, social relations, ethnic studies, cultural studies, and social work. British anthropology has continued to emphasize social organization and economics over purely symbolic or literary topics. =1980s to present= A European Association of Social Anthropologists (EASA) was founded in 1989 as a society of scholarship at a meeting of founder members from fourteen European countries, supported by the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research. The Association seeks to advance anthropology in Europe by organizing biennial conferences and by editing its academic journal, Social Anthropology/Anthropologies Social. Departments of Social Anthropology at different Universities have tended to focus on disparate aspects of the field. Departments of Social Anthropology exist in universities around the world. The field of social anthropology has expanded in ways not anticipated by the founders of the field, as for example in the subfield of structure and dynamics.

Geography Geography of the Posavina region is defined by geological features of the central (inner) zones of the Sava river basin, that are near or adjacent to the Sava river itself. The region is stretched along the Sava river, that flows from wast to east, connecting valleys and plains in transitional regions between the Dinaric Mountains and the Pannonian Plain. Geographical borders of the Posavina region are defined, to the south, by northern zones of the Dinaric mountain system, while Posavina‚Ä≤s northern borders are defined by the Pannonian island mountains. In terms of political geography, the Posavina region is divided into: Croatian Posavina (section of Posavina within the borders of Croatia), Bosnian Posavina (section of Posavina within the borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina), and Serbian Posavina (section of Posavina within the borders of Serbia).International Sava River Basin Commission: Sava River Basin Analysis Report (2009) History During the Roman era, the region belonged to the province of Pannonia, marking its most southern zone. During the reign of emperor Augustus, it was the epicenter of the Pannonian Uprising. During the 5th century, the regios was invaded by several migrating peoples, including Huns and Goths. In post-Roman era, during the 6th century, the region was contested between Ostrogoths, Gepids, Langobards, Avars, and the Byzantine Empire. By the end the 6th and during the 7th century, the entire region was settled by South Slavs. In 819-823, western parts of the region were center of the Ljudevit's Rebellion against the Frankish Empire. During the 11th and 12th century, almost all parts of Posavina were gradually conquered by the Kingdom of Hungary. In the first half of the 18th century, Sava-Danube (Posavina-Podunavlje) section of the Habsburg Military Frontier existed in the area. Posavina segment of the Frontier comprised parts of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia ‚Äì the southern parts of Slavonia and Syrmia, stretching from Nova Gradi≈°ka to the confluence of the Drina river into the Sava. Between 1929 and 1939, one of the provinces of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was known as the Croatian region Sava Banovina. The capital city of the province was Zagreb in Croatia. In 1939, Sava Banovina was merged with Littoral Banovina to form new Banovina of Croatia. Today, one of the counties in Croatia is named Brod-Posavina County and one of the cantons in Bosnia and Herzegovina is named Posavina Canton. The Bosnian Posavina region was gravely hit by the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1992‚Äì95) to the point that parts of it had become uninhabited , as almost all the houses were plundered, burnt or destroyed. Only a small number of people have returned to their homes.

History Microsoft Passport, the predecessor to Windows Live ID, was originally positioned as a single sign-on service for all web commerce. Microsoft Passport received much criticism. A prominent critic was Kim Cameron, the author of The Laws of Identity, who questioned Microsoft Passport in its violations of those laws. He has since become Microsoft's Chief Identity Architect and helped address those violations in the design of the Windows Live ID identity meta-system. As a consequence, Windows Live ID is not positioned as the single sign-on service for all web commerce, but as one choice of many among identity systems. In December 1999, Microsoft neglected to pay their annual $35 \\"passport.com\\" domain registration fee to Network Solutions. The oversight made Hotmail, which used the site for authentication, unavailable on December 24. A Linux consultant, Michael Chaney, paid it the next day (Christmas), hoping it would solve this issue with the downed site. The payment resulted in the site being available the next morning. In Autumn 2003, a similar good Samaritan helped Microsoft when they missed payment on the \\"hotmail.co.uk\\" address, although no downtime resulted. In 2001, the Electronic Frontier Foundation's staff attorney Deborah Pierce criticized Microsoft Passport as a potential threat to privacy after it was revealed that Microsoft would have full access to and usage of customer information.Privacy terms revised for Microsoft Passport The privacy terms were quickly updated by Microsoft to allay customers' fears. In July and August 2001, the Electronic Privacy Information Center and a coalition of fourteen leading consumer groups filed complaintshttp://www.epic.org/privacy/consumer/MS_complaint.pdf with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) alleging that the Microsoft Passport system violated Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTCA), which prohibits unfair or deceptive practices in trade.EPIC: Microsoft Passport Investigation Docket, http://epic.org/privacy/consumer/microsoft/passport.html In 2003, Faisal Danka,Faisal Danka a British Indian IT Risk and Security executive, revealed a serious flaw in Microsoft Passport, through which any account linked to Microsoft Passport or Hotmail could easily be cracked by using any common browser.

Users' credentials are not checked by Microsoft account-enabled websites, but by a Microsoft account authentication server. A new user signing into a Microsoft account-enabled website is first redirected to the nearest authentication server, which asks for username and password over an SSL connection. The user may select to have their computer remember their login: a newly signed-in user has an encrypted time-limited cookie stored on their computer and receives a triple DES encrypted ID-tag that previously has been agreed upon between the authentication server and the Microsoft account-enabled website. This ID-tag is then sent to the website, upon which the website plants another encrypted HTTP cookie in the user's computer, also time-limited. As long as these cookies are valid, the user is not required to supply a username and password. If the user actively logs out of their Microsoft account, these cookies will be removed. Microsoft account offers a user two different methods for creating an account: #Use an existing e-mail address: Users are able to use their own valid e-mail address to sign up for a Microsoft account. The service turns the requesting user's e-mail address into a Microsoft account. Users may also choose a password of their own choice. #Sign up for a Microsoft e-mail address: Users can also sign up for an e-mail account with Microsoft's webmail services designated domains (i.e. @hotmail.com, @live.com, @msn.com, @passport.com and @outlook.com or any variant for a specific country) that can be used as a Microsoft account to sign into other Microsoft account-enabled websites. Microsoft websites, services, and apps such as Bing, MSN and Xbox Live use Microsoft account as a mean of identifying users. There are also several other companies that use it, such as the Hoyts website which is hosted by NineMSN. Windows XP and later has an option to link a Windows user account with a Microsoft account, thus automatically logging users in to their Microsoft account whenever a service is accessed. Starting with Windows Server 2012, Windows allows users to directly authenticate into their PCs using their Microsoft account rather than a local or domain user. =Profile= A feature of the Microsoft account service is the profile manager, named Profile, which was formerly part of Windows Live.

Users can share some of their personal information such as interests and hobbies, and social information such as their favorites quote, hometown, or places lived previously. Profile also allows users to modify their privacy settings to decide what is shared. =Web authentication= On August 15, 2007, Microsoft released the Windows Live ID Web Authentication SDK, enabling web developers to integrate Windows Live ID into their websites running on a broad range of web server platforms - including ASP.NET (C#), Java, Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby.LiveSide.net: Windows Live ID Web Authentication Is Final 2007-07-16Live ID Team blog announcement: Windows Live ID Web Authentication SDK for Developers Is Released 2007-07-15 =Support for OpenID= On October 27, 2008, Microsoft announced that it was publicly committed to supporting the OpenID framework, with Windows Live ID becoming an OpenID provider.Windows Live ID Becomes an OpenID Provider This would allow users to use their Windows Live ID to sign into any website that supports OpenID authentication.

In the section entitled \\"Sketches Here and There\\" Leopold discusses the thought process as a holistic view on where one stands in the entire ecosystem.Leopold, Aldo Thinking Like a Mountain To think like a mountain means to have a complete appreciation for the profound interconnectedness of the elements in the ecosystems. It is an ecological exercise using the intricate web of the natural environment rather than thinking as an isolated individual. Origins of the term Aldo Leopold first came up with this term as a result of watching a wolf die off. In those days of Leopold's adventures, no one would ever pass up killing a wolf because fewer wolves meant more deer, which meant great hunting experiences. However, when Leopold saw the ‚Äúfierce green fire dying in her eyes‚Äù he knew that neither the mountain nor the wolf deserved this. Leopold stated in his book, A Sand County Almanac: In this example Leopold shows that the removal of a single species can result in serious negative consequences in an ecosystem. While avoiding trophic cascades is one way to think like a mountain, there are countless other environmental actions that can be categorized under this broad and interconnected concept. Examples in antiquity Although the term was not coined until 1949, several philosophers of the ancient times had viewpoints similar to those who ‚Äúthink like a mountain‚Äù. Epicurus was one of the first ancient philosophers to view the role man plays in nature. His philosophy, Epicureanism, is a materialistic viewpoint that sought to explain the universe solely by natural causes. Lucretius was a later philosopher who had Epicurean ideals. He wrote a six book collection, De Rerum Natura, categorizing the natural word. In Book 5 of De Rerum Natura he writes: In this passage, Lucretius is defining man's place in the creation of the world. Lucretius is an Epicurean supporter, believing that living modestly and gaining knowledge of the working world were the keys to a more pleasurable life. Aristotle also philosophized about man's place in the ecosystem. In his Politics, he discusses the role of community as used when referring to cities, neighborhoods, and households. The idea of thinking like a mountain is primarily ecological, but it can be applied to politics as well. Aristotle provides resources for citizens on how they as individuals fit into their community. Other ancient philosophers approach the idea of viewing one's place in the ecosystem as well. They include Sophocles, a Greek philosopher, and Columella, a Roman philosopher. Sophocles writes in Antigone about natural law and legal institutions. In his eyes, the laws of the gods outweigh those of man and man must understand his place in the order of natural law. Columella, similar to the Epicureans, believed that in order to make the most efficient use of the land, humans should not rely on the gods, but should become more educated and learn to use resources more efficiently. Contemporary examples In much the same way that Rachel Carson‚Äôs bellwether manuscript Silent Spring changed the realm of how and which chemicals are used in nature, Aldo Leopold forever changed the way we view our ecological impact on the environment around us with the introduction of the term ‚ÄúThinking Like a Mountain‚Äù in his book A Sand County Almanac in 1949. Since then, the phrase and the particular mindset it generates has greatly influenced people in all walks of life. Books Philip Connors has attempted to further Leopold's elucidation with respect to matters of the environment through literature. In many of his books, most notably Fire Season, Connors alludes to thinking like a mountain when he urges the reader to think about more than just the costs and benefits an action has on their person. He believes that everyone who witnesses the environment should have the goal of achieving what Leopold spoke of when he describes living in harmony with nature. Connors said, Another author, Leslie Thiele refers to thinking like a mountain in multiple chapters in his book Indra's Net and the Midas Touch. Within one chapter, Thiele explains how thinking like a mountain is, first and foremost, an ecological principle for a sustainable existence. Later, he also cites this sort of living as a basis for environmental ethics. Thiele summarizes his view of thinking like a mountain as Film The idea of thinking like a mountain has also permeated its way into the world of full-length movies and documentaries. Green Fire, released in 2011, is a documentary about Aldo Leopold's influence on modern environmentalism and revolves around the concept of thinking like a mountain. The name Green Fire was meant to capture the image of Leopold's dying she wolf and the passion with which he pursued environmental justice and ecological balance throughout his life. Filmmaker Alexander Hick spent several months in 2017 among the Arhuaco community in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia, filming a feature documentary titled \\"Thinking Like A Mountain\\" with his brother Immanuel Hick as Director of Photography. The film was released at the International Film Festival Nyon \\"visions du reel\\" on April 15, 2018, and screened at other festivals around the world. The Film won the Human Rights Film Award Deutscher Menschenrechts Filmpreis\\" in one of the categories.http://www.thinkinglikeamountain.org https://www.menschenrechts- filmpreis.de Mission Wolf: Experiment in Living (2018) documents a group of volunteers near the southern edge of the Rocky Mountains who seek to nurture themselves just as they nurture the wolves they care deeply about. Leopold's thoughts on wolves and nature are reflected and reference in the film. Music The mindset of thinking like a mountain has been infused into music as well. Folk artist Libby Roderick has used the idea of thinking like a mountain as a foundation for her album Thinking Like a Mountain. In one song in particular, Roderick equates thinking like a mountain to being safe, home, or complete. Also, she ends each stanza with ‚ÄúThinking like a mountain, honey, we will make it home‚Äù as if to say that eventually we will all think with a long-term perspective and get our lives back on a safe and sustainable track. Furthermore, Roderick ends the song with an ultimatum for each of our lives.

Nanotechnology Nanotechnology deals with structures and materials that are approximately one to one-hundred nanometers in length. At this microscopic level, quantum mechanics take place and are in effect, resulting in behaviors that would seem quite strange compared to what humans see with the naked eye (regular matter). Nanotechnology is used for a wide variety of fields of technology, ranging from energy to electronics to medicine. In the category of medicine, nanotechnology is still relatively new and has not yet been widely adopted by the field. It is possible that nanotechnology could be the new breakthrough of medicine and may eventually be the solution and cure for many of the health problems that humans encounter. Nanotechnology may lead to the cure for illnesses such as the common cold, diseases, and cancer. It is already starting to be used as a treatment for some serious health issues; more specifically it is being used to treat the heart and cancer. Nanomedicine Nanotechnology in the field of medicine is more commonly referred to as nanomedicine. Nanomedicine that deals with helping the heart is really starting to take off and gain in popularity compared to most of the other fields that nanomedicine currently has to offer. There are several heart problems that nanotechnology has promising evidence of being effective in the treatment of heart disease in the near future. =Examples= It should hopefully be able to treat heart valves that are defective; and detect and treat arterial plaque in the heart (\\"Nanotechnology Made Clear\\"). Nanomedicine should be able to help heal the hearts of people that have already been victims of heart disease and heart attacks. On the other hand, it will also play a key role in finding people with a high risk of having heart disease, and will be able to help prevent heart attacks from happening in the first place. Nanotechnology of the heart is a lot less invasive than surgery because everything is occurring at a minuscule level in the body compared to relatively large tissues that are dealt with in surgery. With our technology today, heart surgeries are performed to treat the damaged heart tissue that resulted from a heart attack. This is a major surgery that usually takes a couple of months to recover from (\\"WebMD - Better Information. Better Health\\"). During this period, patients are extremely limited in the activities that they can do. This long recovery process is an inconvenience to the patients, and with the growth of medicine it most likely won't be very long before a more efficient method for treating heart attack patients will be developed and used. The method that is the frontrunner to replace major heart surgery is the use of nanotechnology. There are a couple alternate ways to heart surgery that nanotechnology will potentially be able to offer in the future. Alternatives to surgery With people that have heart disease or that have suffered a heart attack, their hearts are often damaged and weakened. The more minor forms of heart failure do not require surgery and are often treated with medications (\\"WebMD - Better Information. Better Health\\"). The use of nanotechnology on treating damaged hearts will not replace these milder heart problems, but rather the more serious heart problems that currently require surgery or sometimes even heart transplants. =Heart repair= A group of engineers, doctors and materials scientists at MIT and Children's Hospital Boston have teamed together and are starting the movement of finding a way to use nanotechnology to strengthen the weakened heart tissue (\\"MIT - Massachusetts Institute of Technology\\"). The first method uses nanotechnology combined with tissue engineering, and gold nanowires are placed and woven into the damaged parts of the heart, essentially replacing the non- functioning or dead tissues. =Tissue regeneration= The other approach would potentially use minuscule nanoparticles that would travel through the body and find dying heart tissue. The nanoparticles would be carrying objects such as \\"stem cells, growth factors, drugs and other therapeutic compounds,\\". Then the nanoparticles would release the compounds and inject them into the damaged heart tissue. This would theoretically lead to the regeneration of the tissue. Heart repair difficulties Being able to fix cardiac tissue that has been damaged from a heart attack or heart disease is not very simple and it is one of the major challenges today in the field of tissue engineering (\\"Popular Science\\"). This is because heart cells are not the easiest objects to create in a lab. It takes an enormous amount of special care and work to develop the cells so that they beat in sync with one another (\\"Popular Science\\"). Even after the heart cells have finally been made, it is also a large task to insert the cells into the inoperable parts of the heart and to get them working in unison with the tissues that were still working properly (\\"Popular Science\\"). =Heart patches= There have been several successful examples of this with the use of a \\"stem-cell- based heart patch developed by Duke University researchers,\\" (\\"Popular Science\\"). The biomaterials that make up the patch are usually made of either biological polymers like alginate or synthetic polymers such as polylactic acid (\\"Nature Nanotechnology\\"). These materials are good at organizing the cells into functioning tissues; however they act as insulators and are poor conductors of electricity, which is a major problem especially in the heart (\\"Nature Nanotechnology\\"). Since the electrical signals that are sent between calcium ions are what control when the cardiomyocytes of the heart contract, which makes the heart beat, the stem-cell heart patch is not very efficient and not as effective as doctors would like it to be (\\"Popular Science\\"). The results of the patch not being very conductive is that the cells are not able to attain a smooth, continuous beat throughout the entire tissue containing the stem cells. This results in the heart not functioning properly, which in turn could mean that more heart problems might arise due to the implanting of the stem cells. =Tissue scaffolds= Recently there have been some new developments in the field of nanotechnology that will be more efficient than the poorly conducting stem- cell-based patch (\\"Nature Nanotechnology\\"). Scientists and researchers found a way for these stem cell patches (also known as tissue scaffolds) to be conductive and therefore become exponentially more effective (\\"Nature Nanotechnology\\"). They found that by growing gold nanowires into and through the patches, they were able to greatly increase the electrical conductivity. The nanowires are thicker than the original scaffold and the cells are better organized as well. There is also an increase in production of the proteins needed for muscle calcium binding and contraction. The gold nanowires poke through the stem cell's scaffolding material, which strengthens the electrical communication between surrounding heart cells. Without the nanowires, the stem cell patches produced a minute current and the cells would only beat in small clusters at the stimulation origin. With the nanowires, the cells seem to contract together even when they are clustered far away from the source of stimulation. The use of gold nanowires with the stem cell heart patches is still a relatively new concept and it will probably be awhile before they will be used in humans. It is hoped that the nanowires will be tested in live animals in the near future. =Nanoparticles= Another way that nanotechnology will potentially be used to help fix damaged heart tissues is through the use of guided nanoparticle \\"missiles\\". These nanoparticles can cling to and attach to artery walls and secrete medicine at a slow rate (\\"MIT- Massachusetts Institute of Technology\\"). The particles, known as nanoburrs due to the fact that they are coated with little protein fragments that stick to and target certain proteins. The nanoburrs can be made to release the drug that is attached to them over the course of several days (\\"MIT-Massachusetts Institute of Technology\\"). They are unique compared to regular drugs because they can find the particular damaged tissue, attach to it, and release the drug payload that is attached to it (\\"MIT-Massachusetts Institute of Technology\\"). What happens is the nanoburrs are targeted to a certain structure, known as the basement membrane; this membrane lines the arterial walls and is only present if the area is damaged. Nanoburrs could be able to carry drugs that are effective in treating the heart, and also potentially carry stem cells to help regenerate the damaged heart tissue (\\"MIT- Massachusetts Institute of Technology\\"). Composition The particles are made up of three different layers and are sixty nanometers in diameter (\\"MIT- Massachusetts Institute of Technology\\").The outer layer is a coating of polymer called PEG, and its job is to protect the drug from disintegrating while it is traveling through the body. The middle layer consists of a fatty substance and the inner core contains the actual drug along with a polymer chain, which controls the amount of time it will take before the drug is released (\\"MIT-Massachusetts Institute of Technology\\"). Research In a study done on rats, the nanoparticles were injected directly into the rat's tail and they still were able to reach the desired target (the left carotid artery) at a rate that was twice the amount of the non-targeted nanoparticles (\\"MIT-Massachusetts Institute of Technology\\"). Because the particles can deliver drugs over a long period of time, and can be injected intravenously, the patients would not need to have multiple repeated injections, or invasive surgeries on the heart which would be a lot more convenient. The only downside to this is that the existing delivery approaches are invasive, requiring either a direct injection into the heart, catheter procedures, or surgical implants. There is no question, however, that the future of heart repairs and heart disease/attack prevention will definitely involve the use of nanotechnology in some way. =Polyketal nanoparticles= Composition Polyketal nanoparticles are pH-sensitive, hydrophobic nanoparticles formulated from poly(1-4-phenyleneacetone dimethylene ketal). They are an acid-sensitive vehicle of drug delivery, specifically designed for targeting the environments of tumors, phagosomes, and inflammatory tissue. In such acidic environments, these nanoparticles undergo accelerated hydrolysis into low molecular weight hydrophilic compounds, consequently releasing their therapeutic contents at a faster rate. Unlike polyester-based nanoparticles, polyketal nanoparticles do not generate acidic degradation products following hydrolysis Use in myocardial infarction Post-myocardial infarction, inflammatory leukocytes invade the myocardium. Leukocytes contain high amounts of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and Nox2. Nox2 and NADPH oxidase combine to act as a major source of cardiac superoxide production, which in excess can lead to myocyte hypertrophy, apoptosis, fibrosis, and increased matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression. In a mouse-model study by Somasuntharam et al. 2013, polyketal nanoparticles were used as a delivery vehicle for siRNA to target and inhibit Nox2 in the infarcted heart. Following intramyocardial injection in vivo, Nox2-siRNA nanoparticles prevented upregulation of Nox2-NADPH oxidase, and improved fractional shortening. When taken up by macrophages in the myocardium following a MI, the nanoparticles degraded in the acidic environment of the endosomes/phagosomes, releasing Nox2-specific siRNA into the cytoplasm. Polyketal nanoparticles have also been used in the infarcted mouse heart to prevent ischemia-reperfusion injury caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Levels of the antioxidant Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), which scavenges harmful ROS, decrease following MI. SOD1-enacapsulated polyketal nanoparticles are able to scavenge reperfusion- injury induced ROS. Furthermore, this treatment improved fractional shortening, suggesting the benefit of targeted delivery by polyketals. One of the key advantages of polyketal use is that they do not exacerbate the inflammatory response, even when administered at concentrations exceeding therapeutic limits. In contrast to commonly used poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles, polyketal nanoparticle administration in mice instigates little recruitment of inflammatory cells. Additionally, intramuscular injection of polyketals into the leg of rats shows no significant increases in inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1√ü, TNF-Œ± and IL-12.

The GIS data used includes soil, water, and geological information, wildlife movements and habitat data, as well as existing trails and parks, transportation and infrastructure fixtures, educational and historical sites, and political boundaries. This system would be created in accordance with the December 1994 report from the Florida Greenways Commission to the Governor of the state of Florida, a report which outlined the protocol for creating it. Such a system would connect all aspects of the state's \\"green infrastructure\\", making it more comprehensive for use by the state's citizens and more effective in achieving greater sustainability throughout the state of Florida for generations to come. Such sustainability would be achieved through the various goals of the project, primarily a conservation effort to preserve Florida's existing ecosystems and landscapes, such as the Loxahatchee River at Jonathan Dickinson State Park and the Broward Urban River Trail in Fort Lauderdale, while taking into account the habitats of native species such as the Florida panther, the Florida black bear and the crested caracara (their habitat data was taken into account when the network was updated) as well as to connect these remain systems and maintain their ability to function as \\"dynamic systems\\", as well as adapt to \\"future environmental changes\\", such as to mitigate the effects of climate change. The network is used as a main data source, Florida Forever, for identifying the most significant and intact landscapes for conserving in the state. The project is a collaboration of many groups and leadership has gone from the Florida Greenways Commission (Commission), the Florida Greenways Coordinating Council (FGCC) with support from the state Department of Environmental Protection's (DEP) Office of Greenways and Trails (OGT), and the Florida Greenways and Trails Council (FGTC). All three organizations worked with support from professors, staff, and students of the University of Florida GeoPlan Center, the Department of Landscape Architecture, the Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation, and the Department of Urban and Regional Planning (University). Foundations and history The basis for the FEGN is in the state recreational trails system, approved by Legislature in 1979, as well as the Florida Canoe Trail System and preexisting parks, refuges and water and wildlife management areas.http://www.dep.state.fl.us/gwt/community/refguide/pdf/execsumm.pdf In 1991, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection established a Statewide Greenways Program to achieve greater coherence among the state's large ecologically significant places. Land acquisition for the purpose of conservation in Florida dates back to the early 1960s. The Greenways Program was developed to determine how conservation efforts could be distributed in order to best benefit the nature and people of Florida. In 1993, the Florida Greenways Commission was created, and it assumed guidance of the program, which includes public education programs in addition to the conceptual work of developing the Greenways system. Until 1995, Florida Greenways Commission worked with support from the 1000 Friends of Florida and The Conservation Fund to assess current greenways and plan for future greenways and state agency leadership of the project. The university compiled a database of existent conservation lands and trails in the state under FGC leadership. In 1995 leadership moved to the Florida Greenways Coordinating Council in cooperation with the state DEP's OGT. The university applied GIS software to identify \\"ecological and recreational hubs and links\\" to integrate into the network. Hubs are areas with highest-ranked ecological significance that are large enough to sustain key species and ecological processes. Links are the areas connecting the hubs and sites. In 1997, the FEGN, as part of the Florida Greenways Plan became authorized by state law.http://www.linc.us/FloridaWildlifeCorridor_Info.html The Greenways Implementation Plan, a collaborative effort of \\" the Florida Greenways Commission, Florida Greenways Coordinating Council, state, regional, and federal agencies, scientists, university personnel, conservation groups, planners and the general public,\\" was completed in 1998.http://www.fgdl.org/metadata/metadata_archive/fgdc_html/gweco_prio_2005.fgdc.htm The next year, the Florida Greenways and Trail Council (FGTC) took over the work of the Commission and the FGCC. Support from the OGT continued, and the OGT established an \\"official greenways designation process.\\" In the following year, the Florida Greenways and Trails Council prioritized the network into 6 different levels of significance, based on their importance for maintaining statewide ecological connectivity. The university, using GIS software, developed a prioritization of land presenting the best opportunities to create a connected statewide ecological system in 2002. Jason Teisinger modeled development pressure, allowing prioritization of critical linkages based on ecological significance and pressure of development. In 2004 the boundaries of the Florida Ecological Network were updated and approved by the Florida Greenways and Trails Council in September., In 2005 Prioritization of land use was updated and approved by the Florida Greenways and Trails Council in November. Process The University of Florida and Florida Department of Environmental Protection has been involved in the development of the Florida Ecological Greenway Network plan. The key elements considered in the formation of the greenway were land use, critical habitats for native species, ecologically important natural communities, wetlands, floodplains, primitive areas, and important aquatic ecosystems. In order to conserve Florida's native ecosystems and landscapes six strategies were used to help create the network design. These include \\"Identifying and conserving an integrated, statewide system of greenways that encompasses the full range of Florida's native ecosystems and landscapes Using Florida's rivers, springs, lakes, and other inland and coastal aquatic features as strategic building blocks in the statewide greenways system Linking a full range of regional landscapes through Florida's system of greenways that include publicly owned lands harboring native ecosystems and privately owned, highly managed forestry and agricultural properties Planning and managing the statewide system of greenways using the best information available about the requirements of Florida's native ecosystems and landscapes Addressing native ecosystem conservation and human use compatibility issues by developing greenway design and management guidelines Undertaking and/or supporting the research and monitoring efforts necessary to effectively plan and manage native ecosystems and landscapes within Florida's system of greenways.\\" The first step of the design process involves using a GIS based design model to \\"categorize natural and built landscape features. Data used in the GIS model include natural areas and features, geological formations, soil types, watershed boundaries, wetlands, water bodies, floodplains, wildlife movement corridors, endangered species habitats, nature-based trails and parks, outdoor education sites, cultural and historical resource sites, distribution and type of built structures, existing and planned roads, railways, and trails; and political boundaries.\\" The next step was to prioritize between high, medium, and low areas of importance. In order to do this efficiently and effectively, a specific set of criteria was used in the prioritization. The process involved; \\"meetings among state and regional officials to discuss criteria and data for selecting priorities, development by cooperators at the University of Florida of a GIS methodology to rank lands within the network for their relative value to statewide connectivity, application of additional filters to lands identified as high and moderate priorities to rank their potential importance as riparian corridors or to wide-ranging species such as bears and panthers; and the identification of the six priority classes.\\" Once the areas were prioritized based on relative importance it was necessary to assign critical linkage areas. These critical linkage areas are the portions of the network that serve the greatest importance to the protection of the FEGN. Critical linkages are designated as such, based on their ecological importance and the level of threat of development. Twenty-four linkages were proposed, after the selection process ten regions were designated critical linkage areas and will serve as the areas with the highest priorities for protecting. The decision making process involves; determining the extent to which an area was necessary for the completion of the state greenway, the likelihood an area has of being converted or developed, and an analysis of land ownership and the feasibility of purchase. Of the 2.7 million acres of critical linkages, so far 17% of the greenway exists, 30% is proposed, and private landowners hold more than 50% of the land. Currently Florida Forever and other land conservation agencies are working on land acquisition purchases for many of these remaining properties. Results As a result of the program, the FGTC has approved over 700,000 acres and nearly 1,500 miles of land and water trails for designation and ten critical linkages have been identified as high priorities for conservation. The FEGN system and organization has served as a model that exemplifies the use of hubs, links, and sites as critical to conservation, which is applicable on the regional, state and multi-state scale. The states of Maryland and Virginia, the New Jersey Conservation Foundation, the Saginaw Bay Greenways Collaborative in Michigan, the Chesapeake Bay Program, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the southeast United States subsequently adopted the use of GIS software for work on the Ecological Network. The FEGN is also used as data for informing the Florida Forever Needs Assessment project and the Critical Lands and Waters Identification Project. Due to the emphasis placed on their habitats when protecting land in the FEGN, the success of the network could contribute heavily to the conservation of the Florida panther and the Florida black bear. Current progress on the network, lacks of support from the public and politicians, according to Tom Hoctor, PhD, director of the Center for Landscape and Conservation Planning at the university. Thus the project is focusing on creating a public awareness campaign that appeals to landowners.

He was the son of a farmer, Pa Joseph Oyeleye Aare, whose main produce was cocoa, kolanut, and bitter kola. His mother, Madam Felicia Esan Oyeleye, was a \\"petty trader\\" who hawked beans and pap. His early childhood was the foundation of his religious life and core values, where his parents through example developed his faith in God, \\"respect for others, desire for service, and passion for excellence\\". Teju Oyeleye attended Peter's Anglican Primary School, the equivalent to Elementary School in North America. He later attended Ilesha Grammar School, where he graduated in 1942. He had several important role models growing up. His older brother, Daniel Babalola Oyeleye, got him his first job after high school at the Nigerian Post and Telegram, or P&T;, organisation, where he worked for about 10 years. His older brother also encouraged him to follow his passion for science. While working at P&T;, he developed a fascination for morse code and the science around how the telegraph key worked. Another mentor was the cousin of a good friend who was a teacher at Yaba Technical College. The cousin's explanation of how a telegraph key functioned and the relationship between electricity and magnetism was crucial in his selecting Electrical Engineering in college. A final role model for Teju was Mr. Joseph Onawumi, who encouraged him with his GCE Advanced level classes (the equivalent to AP classes) in Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics and assisted him with his application to the University of London.  College  In 1952, Teju Oyeleye attended the University of London. The scholarship he earned for his exceptional scores on the GCE \\"A‚Äù level examinations, from the Western Nigeria Production Board, aided him in his goal to study Engineering at the university. The field of engineering and science and technology as a whole was relatively new for Teju entering college. His high school, Ilesha Grammar School, did not offer any science classes which left him at a significant disadvantage compared to his peers at University of London. However, his unwavering interest in science and technology helped him overcome his shortcomings in the field. In 1957, he received an Electrical Engineering degree from the University of London. During his time at the University of London, Teju was the president of African Students and was the publicity officer of the college students union.  Career  = Ferguson Radio Corporation = After college, Teju Oyeleye spent two years (1957‚Äì1959) getting practical experience at Ferguson Radio Corporation, Enfield, North London. After his experience at Fergusson Radio, Teju Oyeleye returned to Nigeria with his wife Mrs. Funke Oyeleye, a registered nurse. = WNTV-WNBS (Western Nigeria Television and Broadcasting Service) = Back in Nigeria, Teju Oyeleye jumped into a much bigger project. The Western Nigerian Television Station hired him in September 1959 as a Development Engineer. This was the first television station in Africa which meant a lot of things were required of the company. First, the company needed to provide television service to the general public. They would then have to broadcast channels for the consumers to watch. This required a lot of professionals, many of whom were being called back from their dwellings in England, to come over and establish this new television station in Nigeria. Teju Oyeleye was one of the engineers chosen to fulfill the demand. The television station grew rapidly since Teju's arrival. The shows started in black and white with shows only airing from four o'clock in the afternoon to midnight. The shows that aired included live programs, recorded programs, movies, interviews, outside broadcasts and the radio broadcasting he was also in charge with included the morning news, jingles, and talk shows. Color television arrived in 1975, a few years after the time Teju Oyeleye moved to his next professional challenge Total Nigeria Limited. As West Nigerian Television and Broadcasting Services (WNTV-WNBS) developed and expanded from one city to the entire continent around the time of Teju's arrival, so did Teju's role in the company become much more integral to the company's success. Teju experienced a series of promotions from his initial program as Development Manager to his position as Chief Engineer, and eventually general manager in 1966 which was the equivalent of chief executive officer in North American companies. He was the first Nigerian general manager of the first television station in Africa. Teju's management style was \\"collaborative in nature and his direct reports were given significant responsibility as well as the accountability that went along with it\\". In other words, he encouraged his employees and himself to work with each other to get most tasks done and his workers were responsible for the work they were assigned. He would often set goals for his workers and use simple data analysis to measure how close they came to accomplishing these goals. :\\"We set up the scheme of service, the staff regulations and the financial regulations. We were having a monthly meeting at which we would review the previous month and set out what we were going to do in the ensuing month. We had a programme committee under the chairmanship of the controller of programs. We used participatory management techniques in which each of the 6 HOD's [heads of department] participated in the management. The departments were Administration under the secretary, Engineering under the Chief Engineer, Programs under the Controller of Programs, News and Current Affairs under the Head of News and Commercial under the Commercial Manager who was located in Lagos because of the strategic location as the commercial and administrative capital at that time\\". During his time as general manager, he mentored a lot of second generation Television Station CEOs. A number of his pupils eventually went on to head the newer TV stations while they were being created all across Nigeria. = Total Nigeria PLC = Eventually Teju felt it was time to leave his executive position at WNTV-WNBS. He made note that \\"Anytime you don't feel you're contributing sufficiently to a job‚Ä¶ it's time to leave\\". When he joined Total in 1973, he started as an Assistant Operations Manager. However, in a span of six years and five promotions, he had risen to the rank of general manager, which in this scenario was the equivalent to chief operating officer. He held this position for another six years, until 1984. His experience as general manager at Western Nigeria Television was not a waste when it came to climbing the ranks. He explained during our interview, \\"No experience is lost if you value it well\\". Prior to him, no other Nigerian had risen to that level in the organisation. At the time he joined Total they were ranked number three in Nigeria in terms of productivity amongst the petroleum companies. Eleven years later when he was promoted from his position as general manager (In this scenario he was the chief operating officer), the brand had risen to be number one in Nigeria. For his next assignment, Engineer Oyeleye was asked to help set up several new ventures (similar to incubator companies) for Total. For the three years he spent in the role of Group Executive Director of Total Nigeria Subsidiaries, Engr. Oyeleye formed several successful subsidiaries that grew significantly in size. The Nigerian Gas Cylinder Manufacturing company was the first of its kind in Nigeria and manufactured gas cylinders that were used for cooking in almost every home. Another highly successful subsidiary supplied bitumen (road tar) and lubricants to the country. Teju Oyeleye retired from Total in 1991, but remained on the board of directors until 1994. He was succeeded as general manager by Sunny A. Olu Jegede.  Professional Organizations  = Nigerian Society of Engineers = In 1958, Olateju Oyeleye and Chief G.O. Aiwereoba formed the Nigerian Society of Engineers in London, England. After several meetings, the inaugural meeting on the Nigerian Society of Engineers was held at the Nigerian house in London in February that same year. Engr. Teju Oyeleye took on the position of Secretary-General during the earlier years of the organisation, starting from when Chief G.O. Aiwereoba was president. Aiwereoba stepped down the following year and a new president was elected every two years. Teju Oyeleye took over the organisation for two years, in 1976 to 1977. Nigerian Society of Engineers was the largest body in Africa that recognised students and graduate engineers. It was founded to create a more unionised voice of Nigeria's engineers so they could discuss with government officials and unofficial authorities topics related to technology. It also served as a beacon of knowledge where so many experienced engineers gathered to share their experiences with the less experienced engineers and also other officials not directly involved in the engineering profession. However, the most important function of this society was to promote the ideas and interests of its members and to protect each member and their families with backup monetary support. The Nigerian Society has over time split into several divisions. A few of these divisions include one for Chemical Engineers (NSCE), one for Civil Engineers (NICE), and one for female engineers, APWE. = Nigerian Institute of Management = Engr. Teju Oyeleye was elected in 1988 to be the eighth president of the Nigerian Institute of Management. The Nigerian Institute of Management was designed to educate any person interested in pursuing a management profession in Nigeria. It sets the standard of knowledge for all managers and ensures that these managers are aware of all the skills vital to successfully running a company. It also judges all potential managers on their qualifications and denies those who are not up to par a profession in the management field. The Institute was founded in 1961 to educate managers and professionals interested in management with practical skills necessary to assertively and effectively manage a company. The organisation's goal was to educate positive managing traits; like the drive to find more economically efficient ways, being more transparent with all issues, and to avoid fraudulent and unethical practices taking place, in a manager's respective company. Teju's main responsibility was to decide which standards should be necessary for a manager to run a company. In 1991, however, he stepped down from his position at this organisation.  Religious life  Olateju Oyeleye was baptised at age two and confirmed at age eighteen by Archbishop L.G. Vinnig. He was a devout Christian, who read the bible from Genesis to Revelation at age fourteen. Throughout his life he devoted at least one hour to bible study and prayer each day (\\"A Life of‚Ä¶\\"). His religion strongly influenced his life and his success at work. He made it his objective to make his life so exemplary that people would follow suit. Currently, he regularly attends the Cathedral Church of Christ and St Peters Church Isona Ilesa. He also attends Church of Pentecost, or the Anglican Communion where he was baptised, at Festac Town. In the Cathedral Church of Christ, he is a member of the Torch Bearers society while at Church of Pentecost, he is a grand patron of the Fountain of Hope Society. During our interview, Teju explained, \\"Christianity is a way of life. It is a way of living. The power of positive thinking will succeed you in everything you are doing.‚Äù  Personal life  Teju Oyeleye married Anne Awujoola Oyeleye (n√©e Smith) in London, England in 1956. Mrs. Oyeleye was a registered nurse who taught at the Jericho Nursing School in Ibadan after they moved to Nigeria. They had 3 children Dr. Layi Oyeleye, Dr. Gunju Oyeleye, and Dr. Biola Oyeleye who are engineers and an ophthalmologist by training, respectively. Mrs Oyeleye died in a car accident in March 1978. After the death of his first wife, he married Comfort Olubunmi Oyeleye (n√©e Awolowo), an accounting executive in 1979. They have 3 children; Tolu, Kike and Fola. He died in July 2013 at the age of 89.Olateju Oyeleye 1924‚Äì2013  Awards and Commendations  In December 2003, Teju received an Officer of the Order of the Niger (OON) from previous Nigerian president, Olusegun Obasanjo. This was one of the highest awards given by the president of Nigeria. This award acknowledges his National development, or all the renovations Engr. Olateju Oyeleye made to Nigeria, including his work at WNTV- WNBS, Total Nigeria PLC, NSE, NIM, NCC, and many others.

Early years Tucker was born on 1 March 1935 in Ripley, Tennessee,(5) the eldest son of James Shelby Tucker and Louise Nowlin Tucker, and educated at Saint Stanislaus College (Bay St. Louis MS), East High School (Memphis TN), Phillips Academy, Andover, Yale University, Corpus Christi College, Oxford University and Tulane Law School.(6) He was called to the bar in Louisiana and New York(7) and admitted to practice before the Fifth, Second and Eleventh United States Circuit Courts of Appeal and the United States Supreme Court. He has practiced law in London, New York City, New Orleans, Wellington, New Zealand and Perth, Western Australia. He is married to Carole Shelby Carnes, a distant cousin. Acting for his wife in Tucker v. Summers, he changed the rules governing admission of foreign-trained lawyers to the Louisiana bar.(8). He is also the half-brother of Bruen Tucker, a distinguished member of the Oregon Society of CPA and accomplished golfer with an almost trusted handicap of 5. Travels Tucker expounded his passion for travel in an interview for the Andover Bulletin: 'Spanish has an expression for monomania. \\"Cada loco tiene su tema\\" ‚Äîevery lunatic has his theme. Mine, for most of my life, has been the open road, wherever it leads.'(9) When he was 17, he left his father asleep in their hotel room in Shreveport and hitchhiked to the Pacific coast and on to Yellowstone Park, Salt Lake City, Denver, El Paso and Mexico City, returning home after three weeks in time for school.(10) Nine months later, he boarded a tanker as supercargo, sailed to Venezuela and on to Haifa, then hitchhiked around Israel and most of Western Europe.(11) Two summers later, he hitchhiked across North Africa.(12) In 1957, while an undergraduate at Oxford, he attended the VIth World Festival of Youth and Students in Moscow, then travelled through Siberia to Peking, notwithstanding a US government ban on travel there.(13) After leaving Oxford, he hitchhiked to Egypt.(14) In 1960-2, he spent eight months hitchhiking from England to and around the Indian subcontinent,(15) then signed on a freighter bound for New Zealand and hitchhiked through New Zealand, Australia, Indonesia, Malaya, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Japan, then signed on a freighter bound for California and hitchhiked to Alaska.(16) He drove from Europe to Saudi Arabia via Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, and returned via Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco in 1965, and two years later hitchhiked from Rio de Janeiro to Buenos Aires, Santiago, La Paz, Cuzco, Machu Picchu, Lima and Bogota, walked along ancient Indian trails through the jungle to Panama, then hitchhiked to Mississippi through Central America and Mexico.(17) In 1967 he made the first of 16 trips to sub-Saharan Africa.(18) In 1972, after the government of Ethiopia closed its border with Sudan, he rode into Metemma on a camel.(19) His honeymoon after his marriage in Zanzibar in 1976, was overlanding back to England via the Nile, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria and Turkey.(20) After hitching around Malawi in 1988, he returned to England via Kenya, Somalia, Djibouti, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Iraq and Turkey.(21) In 1989, the year following his Among Insurgents trek, he trekked around eastern Burma with the Karen National Liberation Army.(22) In 2002, he crossed the Atlantic in a sailboat.(23) He returned to New Zealand in 2006 and Australia in 2007 to hitchhike to places he had not reached in 1961-2(24) and in 2010-11 repeated his 1960 hitchhiking trip through the Middle East and around the Indian subcontinent.(25) Critics' evaluation =Among Insurgents= Among Insurgents was ranked the top-selling travel hardback in the UK three weeks after its publication.(26) Maggie Gee wrote that it was 'a first book by an unknown author that makes you want to stand up and applaud ... it deserves to become a classic.'(27) A review in the Royal Geographical Society's Geographical Magazine stated: 'It is always dangerous to bandy around words like \\"classic\\", but Among Insurgents is a rare treasure ... It is a tale which can only inspire the utmost respect ... '(28) It was Colin Thubron's favourite reading for 2000. He characterized it as an 'astonishing book: a surreal mixture of Boy's Own derring-do and expert knowledge of an almost unknown region'(29) Six national newspapers in the UK selected it for their Best Books of the Year features.(30) Tobias Wolfe said, 'I have seldom been more aware of the line between courage and lunacy.(31) Robert Carver described it as 'a throwback to the heroic age of travel ... the most unusual and distinguished travel book I have read for years(32) and the author as 'the most extraordinary adventurer and original travel writer of the second half of the 20th century. You have to search the heroic age of discovery for his equal ‚Äì he is a genuine one-off, with no earthly competition.(33) Among Insurgents describes the author's journey into Burma through a border area of China closed to foreigners, through the Shan and Kachin States, and out of Burma via an area of India closed to foreigners. En route, he was detained by Communist insurgents, handed over to Kachin insurgents and arrested by the Indian Army. Among Insurgents also examines the symbiotic relationship between the civil war in Burma and the international drugs trade. The author interviewed growers of opium poppies and leaders on both sides of the narcotics divide, and his report to the US National Security Council may have contributed to Washington's changed perception of the Burmese Army as the main player in the trade. (Google Books) The genius of this ambitious subject', writes Maggie Gee of Client Service, is all [Tucker's] own, as are his glimpses of the beautiful natural universe against which tiny human beings prance, the sky above them \\"robin's egg blue turning to silver\\". This book is a rarity, at once deeply serious and absurdly enjoyable ... Read it now, before the next wave of irrational exuberance drowns us all. =The Last Banana= Echoing that tribute in his review of The Last Banana, Michael Moran stated that the book's author was 'that rare species of travel writer: an authentic adventurer of expansive Victorian self-confidence and Christian moral conviction; a man of uncompromising intellectual standards and fierce loyalty in friendship. This, in an age devoted to contrived \\"travel experiences\\", cosmetic celebrity and the adoration of the Golden Calf.(34) Fr Alexander Lucie-Smith wrote that The Last Banana was 'the best book about Africa I have ever read or am ever likely to read.(35) Other publications ‚Ä¢ Peace-loving Plodders, National Review, 14 September 1973 ‚Ä¢ Click, click, click, Arab News (Jeddah), 16 July 1978 ‚Ä¢ Zionism ‚Äì A Closed Company, The Commercial Appeal, Memphis TN, 14 August 1978 ‚Ä¢ From the Other Side, The Commercial Appeal, Memphis TN, 26 November 1978, ‚Ä¢ Palestinians and Jews, The Times-Picayune, New Orleans, 3 November 1979 ‚Ä¢ Israel's restraint, The Times-Picayune, New Orleans, 14 August 1981 ‚Ä¢ In defense of Sandanistas and Nicaragua, The Times-Picayune, New Orleans, 25 March 1985 ‚Ä¢ Palestine Revisited, New Horizon, 15 October 1988 ‚Ä¢ book review, Land of Jade: A Journey Through Insurgent Burma by Bertil Lintner, Geographical Magazine, Royal Geographical Society, July 1991 ‚Ä¢ book review, Searching for Fatima by Ghada Karmi, Financial Times, 28/9 December 2002 ‚Ä¢ book review, Burma: Political Economy under Military Rule, Robert Taylor (ed.), The Times Literary Supplement, 9 November 2001 ‚Ä¢ book review, The Heart Must Break: The Fight for Democracy and Truth in Burma by James Mawdsley, Literary Review, November 2001 ‚Ä¢ book review, From the Land of Green Ghosts by Pascal Khoo Thwe, The Times Literary Supplement, 21 March 2003 ‚Ä¢ book review, Haile Selassie's War by Anthony Mockler, Times Literary Supplement, 21 May 2004 ‚Ä¢ book review, A Question of Zion by Jacqueline Rose and Myths of Zionism by John Rose, appendix Hidden Hands?

Background Operation Commando involved five UN divisions of US I Corps; the US 1st Cavalry Division, the US 3rd, US 25th Infantry Division, the Republic of Korea Army (ROK) 1st Division and the 1st Commonwealth Division. The operation was intended to form a line of defense just north of the 38th Parallel and ended on 15 October 1951, having successfully established the Jamestown Line. However, a few hills south of the line remained in the hands of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) and threatened supply lines to Seoul. Operation Polecharge was intended to seize control of these high positions. Operation The 5th Cavalry Regiment of the 1st Cavalry Division, together with the Belgian Battalion attached to the 3rd Infantry Division, was tasked with the capture of Hills 346, 272 and 230. The 8th Cavalry Regiment would provide support if required.Korea Institute of Military History 2001, p. 219 The operation began on 15 October with the seizure of Hill 346 by the 5th Cavalry.Edwards 2010, p.212. On 18 October Hill 230 was captured after initial attacks, supported by the 8th Cavalry, were strongly rebuffed.Edwards 2006, p. 250. Hill 272 was also strongly defended by the PVA but fell to UN forces on 19 October, marking the successful conclusion of Operation Polecharge. During Operations Commando and Polecharge, the UN forces inflicted heavy losses on the PVA, in the order of 16,000 men, and forced the PVA to retreat north to their next line of defence, Yokkok-chon. The 1st Cavalry Division had suffered 2,900 casualties, including losses incurred during Operation Commando, and was withdrawn to Japan the following month.Blair 1987, p. 949. Aftermath Operation Polecharge saw the Jamestown Line secure as well as the elimination of the threat posed by the PVA to the UN's supply lines to Seoul. The conclusion of Operations Commando and Polecharge also marked the beginning of the static phase of the Korean War as well as the resumption of armistice negotiations at Panmunjom.Malkasian 2001, p. 53.

History The organization was founded as a non-profit public foundation by Rauan Kenzhekhanuly, Timur Muktarov, Nartay Ashim and Marat Isbayev in May 2011. The starting project for WikiBilim was the Kazakh Wikipedia in Kazakhstan and developing community in Kazakh Wikipedia., Rauan Kenzhekhanuly, head of the WikiBilim Foundation WikiBilim began negotiations with Wikimedia Foundation in the beginning of May 2011.http://wikibilim.kz/2015/10/28/about-foundation/ On 16 May 2011, WikiBilim announced itself as a project dedicated to Wikipedia in Kazakhstan, during a press conference. The chairman of the Wikimedia Foundation Board, Mr. Ting Chen, himself came to support the Kazakh Wikipedia. Moreover, participating in the press conference were a member of the Kazakh Parliament, Murat Abenov, as well as the chair of the Kazakh National Encyclopedia, Bauyrzhan Zhaqyp, along with a leader of KazContent. At the conference, Chen announced that Wikimedia Foundation supported WikiBilim and appreciated its efforts to expand the Kazakh Wikipedia. The Kazakh National Encyclopedia officially confirmed provision of its entire material with a license CC-BY-SA 3.0 that permits publishing all the encyclopedia materials to the Kazakh Wikipedia. Nokia Corporation announced its sponsorship to the –í–∏–∫–∏- –±”ô–π–≥–µ contest, where it would give 40 cell phones to the best editors of the Kazakh Wikipedia.

In August 2011, Haifa, during the Wikimania 2011 Jimmy Wales presented Kenzhekhanuly with the Wikipedian of the Year award. Moreover, Wales announced his own grant to WikiBilim as a contribution to the development of the Kazakh Wikipedia. The Wikimedia Foundation has given the organisation a $16,600 grant for conducting Turkic Wikimedia Conference in Almaty. Contributors to Wikipedia in the West have raised the question of whether the foundation and Wales should be supporting WikiBilim in light of the backing it has received from the Kazakh government, which has been responsible for closing down independent media outlets in what Human Rights Watch describes as a \\"growing crackdown on free speech\\". On 14‚Äì17 September 2011 the Wikibilim Public Foundation were invited to take part on the Digital Communications Kazakhstan 2011 Exhibition, where it introduced its methods of recruiting youth to startup projects.

Following Major renovations in the year 2000, the church now serves about 5,000 parishioners and is one of the larger Catholic churches in the Serangoon district. 264x264px History In early 1957, Archbishop Ol√ßomendy purchased a 5-acre plot of land in the Serangoon Garden Estate. Originally planned to house British military forced based in Singapore, the area housed around 15,000 people back in the 1950s. This land would have the Church as well as a primary school managed by the Infant Jesus Sisters. After the land in Serangoon Garden was purchased, Father Philippe Meisonnier was appointed to take charge of the church building efforts. Together with members of the Church building committee, Father Meisonnier wasted no time, visiting the people every evening with his trademark fabric bag slung on his shoulders, to make personal appeals for funds to build the church. Finally on 11 January 1959, Archbishop Ol√ßomendy officially blessed the new Church with Father Rene Challet appointed to be its first parish priest. By 1964, the first Parish Council was set up to act as an advisory body to the parish priest. The original parish boundary was centred around the Serangoon Garden Estate, and extended outwards to include Braddell Heights, St Helier‚Äôs Avenue, Brighton Crescent and Plantation Avenue. Subsequently in the 1970s, the area bounded by the Johor Straits, the Ponggol River, the Seletar River and Yio Chu Kang Road was carved out to be under the Church of St Vincent de Paul in 1970. The areas under Ang Mo Kio New Town were also divided between the Church of the Holy Spirit and St Francis Xavier Church to manage. With a growing Catholic community in the parish, a Parish Social Centre was built in 1977 to be a place where the youth of the parish could receive religious education, and adults could use to meet, bond and help each other. A Play School was added on within the Parish Social Centre and kindergarten classes began to run in 1978. Extending its reach to the community within the area, Church members began making regular visits to the Cheshire Home in 1979, and bringing members of the Cheshire Home for mass on Sundays. Under Father John Sim‚Äôs leadership, several renovation projects were undertaken from 1993 to 2004 to provide for a new canteen, a parsonage, an expanded Church and a new parish centre. As part of the Great Jubilee year of celebrations in 1999 to 2000, St Francis Xavier Church was one of the five churches designated to be pilgrimage Churches. Today, the Church of St Francis Xavier proudly serves a population of 5,000 Catholics living in the Serangoon area.

Description The Important Bird Area (IBA) consists of two separate areas - one on the west side of Murat Bay and the other covering the full extent of Tourville Bay. Both bays open to Denial Bay which itself is bounded by St Peter Island, a member of the Nuyts Archipelago, on its east side.

The important bird area includes the intertidal zone and extends inland to take in other coastal features such as wetlands, including mangroves and playa lakes. Criteria for nomination as an IBA The bays have been identified as an IBA by BirdLife International because, together, they support over 1% of the world populations of both pied and sooty oystercatchers. Other birds for which the site is important include common greenshanks, red knots, sharp-tailed sandpipers, banded lapwings, red-capped plovers and fairy terns.

His most notable works include the 1998 novel Pontypool Changes Everything and the screenplay for the film adaptation of that same novel, Pontypool. Burgess' unique style of writing has been called literary horror fiction and described as \\"blended ultra-violent horror and absurdist humour, inflicting nightmarish narratives on the quirky citizens of small-town Ontario: think H. P. Lovecraft meets Stephen Leacock.\\" Early life Burgess was born in Toronto and grew up in Mississauga. He graduated in 1978 from Applewood Heights Secondary School in Mississauga, despite having to use day passes from a medium security facility in order to finish high school. Burgess served three months in this security facility for robbing a convenience store with a friend while wearing one of his mother's blouses, inspired after watching A Clockwork Orange and Straight Time. Burgess then moved back to Toronto where he became a fixture on the art and music scene on Toronto's Queen Street West under the name Tony Blue. He performed poetry as an opening act to punk bands and other acts such as Lydia Lunch usually writing what he would be reading, the day of the reading. He also exhibited his paintings, including a solo show at the Xiphotec Gallery and interior and window designs for the Toxic Empire. During this time, Burgess was banned from Toronto's Hotel Isabella when he drank too much alcohol with a friend and tried to burn the hotel down by lighting paper on top of some of the tables within the hotel. In 1989, Burgess enrolled at the University of Toronto. Six years later, in 1995 he graduated with a degree in semiotics. In 1998, Burgess and his wife, Rachel Jones, moved from their flat in Toronto's Parkdale neighbourhood to a \\"shack by the river\\" in Wasaga Beach, Ontario. At this time, Burgess had a brief musical theatre career during which he starred as Curly in the town's local theatre production of Oklahoma!. Burgess has also at one time played in a band called The Ether Brothers, and had jobs as a telephone psychic and as a factory worker at a vinegar factory. Personal life Burgess currently resides in Stayner with his wife of fourteen years, Rachel Jones, who is a crown attorney. They have two young children, Griffin and Camille. Their current home is a house that is known by the town as the supposedly haunted former Thistlewaite residence. It was built in 1882 and at one point served the community's funerary needs and has a yard that is rumoured to be riddled with suitcase graves filled with pet cats from a previous owner. Burgess is good friends with fellow Canadian novelist Derek McCormack.

The Hellmouths of Bewdley This is the first book in the Pontypool Trilogy. This is a collection of sixteen short stories, featuring such things as insane doctors, supernatural dogs, dead men, and a real ninja turtle, all within the small Ontario town of Bewdley. Pontypool Changes Everything This is the second novel in the Pontypool Trilogy. In this novel, an outbreak of a strange plague, AMPS (Acquired Metastructural Pediculosis), causes people across Ontario to slip into aphasia and then into a cannibalistic zombie rage. AMPS is transferred through language and the only way to stop its spread is to outlaw communication. This metaphysical, deconstructionist virus requires a multi-disciplinary approach and doctors, semioticians, linguists, anthropologists, and even art critics present theories as to its source and treatment. The director of the movie adaptation of Pontypool Changes Everything, Bruce McDonald has described the virus as having three stages, \\"The first stage is you might begin to repeat a word. Something gets stuck. And usually it's words that are terms of endearment, like sweetheart or honey. The second stage is your language becomes scrambled and you can't express yourself properly. The third stage is that you become so distraught at your condition that the only way out of the situation you feel, as an infected person, is to try and chew your way through the mouth of another person.\\" McDonald also stressed that the victims of the virus detailed in the film were not zombies, instead calling them \\"conversationalists.\\" Caesarea This is the third novel in the Pontypool Trilogy. In this novel something mysterious causes insomnia among the inhabitants of the sleepy little town of Caesarea. This insomnia causes many strange things to happen, such as the town's figurehead mayor being replaced by a dwarf doppelganger and Neo-Nazi environmentalists accidentally unleashing purveyors of kiddie snuff- porn on the town. A so-called war is also being waged between the town's respectable citizenry and the white trash from the trailer park. =Fiction for Lovers: A Small Bouquet of Flesh, Fear, Larvae, and Love= This is a collection of nine short prose stories with principal characters \\"Tony\\" and \\"Rachel\\" who are based on Burgess and his wife. The pieces range across a variety of different genres, from the mundane autobiographical fiction to lurid true crime to phantasmagoria. =Ravenna Gets= This is a collection of \\"wheeled stories\\" in which the citizens of Ravenna inexplicably and collectively decide to kill off the entire population of the nearby town of Collingwood. Each story revolves around a unique and violent act of homicide. The inspiration for this novel was news coverage of the fall of Baghdad and its aftermath. =People Live Still in Cashtown Corners= This novel is about Bob Clark who lives and works in Cashtown Corners. In fact, he's the only resident of the tiny rural town. Bob has never really felt like himself whenever other people are around, and feeling normal is all he wants in life. One day, Bob decides that the only way to truly be himself is to murder anyone who makes him feel abnormal; which is everyone. The narrator is modelled after John List, a New Jersey man who killed his wife, mother and three kids and successfully eluded arrest for almost 18 years (when he was captured he was living under the name \\"Bob Clark\\"). Burgess has described the novel as, \\"an intimate first-person account of someone who realizes that he must kill others in order to keep his own disintegration at bay and his frantic attempts to rescue secondary versions of himself where this is not true and make them primary.\\" This novel took Burgess only nine days to finish. =Idaho Winter= This novel follows a boy, Idaho Winter who is loathed by everyone in the town where he lives. He then meets a young girl named Madison who empathizes with his suffering, opening a terrible world of pain in him. When Madison is attacked by dogs meant to harm Idaho, Idaho changes the course of the entire story. He soon learns that his suffering has been cruelly designed by a clumsy writer who has made his book meaner than all the others to make it stand out. With this information, Idaho locks the author in a closet and runs off, armed with the knowledge that the entire world is invented and that he now has the power to imagine it differently. When the author emerges from the closet and discovers that Idaho has made a mess of the novel, he sets out to find a cure to the story and bring its heart and mind together. In this novel there are allusions to classic children's fare, ranging from The Neverending Story to the Choose Your Own Adventure series ‚Äî tales that play with the idea of readers and characters controlling the narrative. The point in the novel when two characters suddenly switch genders was unintentional. According to Burgess: \\"I came back to the story after leaving it aside for two years and I was confused myself‚Äîthen I decided, 'Oh well, that works here.'\\" Idaho Winter is Tony Burgess' first novel for young adults, although it has been called a young adult parody. This is the only novel by Tony Burgess that is not set in an Ontario town. =The n-Body Problem= This novel follows a zombie apocalypse that leaves nothing more than a waste disposal problem. After a number of failed experiments at disposal, officials hit on the solution to the problem of aimless, lifeless wanderers clogging the streets: send the dead into orbit. However, the celestial corpses begin to affect the Earth's sunlight, resulting in \\"Syndrome\\" ‚Äì a blend of paranoia, depression, and hypochondria that turns the living into monsters of a different sort. Film credits Pontypool has been made into live stage productions in the United States and the United Kingdom. Originally, the film Pontypool was to be a radio play for CBC Radio. Burgess wrote out a script for Pontypool in 48 hours, his approach inspired by Orson Welles' radio broadcast of War of the Worlds. He also played in the film adaption of Pontypool and in the science fiction film Ejecta. =Screenplay= *Pontypool (2008) *Music from the Big House (2010) *Septic Man (2013) *Ejecta (2014) *Hellmouth (2014) *Cashtown Corners (TBA) *The Hexecutioners (2015) *Saturn's Rings (2016) =Actor= *Pontypool (Tony(Lawrence)) (2008) *Exit Humanity (Victim) (2011) *Ejecta (Griffin Jones) (2014) *Hellmouth (Tips) (2014) *The Hexecutioners (Milos Somborac) (2015) =Soundtrack= *Pontypool (The Nefud Desert) (2008) Nominations/awards *Pontypool Changes Everything (Winner, Best Book of 1998 by NOW magazine) *Pontypool (Nominated, Best Adapted Screenplay, 2010 Genie Award) *Ravenna Gets (Winner, Short Fiction Category, 2011 ReLit Award) *Idaho Winter (Nominated, 2012 Ontario Trillium Award) Recurring themes Burgess often sets his work in the towns and villages of rural Southern Ontario, including Bewdley, Pontypool, Collingwood and Cashtown Corners. Outbreaks of sudden violence is an idea explored in many of Burgess' works. In both Ravenna Gets and People Live Still in Cashtown Corners, Burgess explores the idea of \\"people suddenly being absolutely not what you think they are.\\" Burgess likes to include photos and images in many of his works, such as Ravenna Gets, Idaho Winter and People Live Still in Cashtown Corners. He often takes these photographs himself. He especially likes using pictures that aren't of anything or representative of looking. Influences When speaking about his beginnings as a writer, Burgess stated, \\"I recognized early that something was wrong, I was definitely not having the same experience as other people around me, which would just be what it was except there was this peculiar making in the middle of it‚Ä¶. I used to draw at this age, horrible violent, busy pictures that my parents would hide from people and worse.\\" Burgess has said that the writers that he read as a teenager, such as Alfred Jarry, Comte de Lautr√©amont, Guillaume Apollinaire, Jean Genet, Alain Robbe- Grillet and Andr√© Gide made the biggest impression on him. He also enjoys Shirley by Charlotte Bront√´ \\"because it starts out so stable then distorts in mysterious ways ... characters vaporize and duplicate, dog bites infect out of the dark, people slip into narcotic winters.\\" He has also said the reason he began writing was because his mother told him he was good at it. Burgess' inspiration comes from many different places such as his life, his past, things he sees, people and sometimes tiny random \\"events.\\" Current projects Burgess is currently writing screenplays for Pontypool 2, Pontypool 3, Idaho Winter and a script about the last few weeks of Chet Baker's life. In 2009, Burgess wrote and performed a musical revue entitled Die! Scream! Die! alongside fellow novelist Derek McCormack at the Scream Literary Festival. Burgess has also facilitated a few workshops at the Toronto New School of Writing.

He is known for his contributions towards the understanding the mechanism of cancer progression in breast, melanoma and other cancers and development of novel therapeutic targets and target-based therapy in cancers. An elected fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Sciences, India, he received the National Bioscience Award for Career Development of the Department of Biotechnology in 2003. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the apex agency of the Government of India for scientific research, awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 2004, for his contributions to biological sciences.  Education and career  Kundu obtained his Ph.D. from Bose Institute, Kolkata, India (1989) in protein biochemistry and did his post-doctoral research work at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, University of Colorado, University of Wyoming, and the National Institutes of Health from 1989 to 1998. He has performed work in the area of cardiovascular biology, inflammation and immunomodulation during that period. In 1998, he joined as Scientist-D at the National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune. At present, he is working as Scientist-G at NCCS. His area of research at NCCS is tumor biology, regulation of gene expression, cell signaling, angiogenesis, cancer therapeutics, biomarker studies for cancer detection, and nanomedicine.

He has published 70 papers in peer reviewed international journals. He serves as Editorial Board Member of Current Molecular Medicine, Molecular Medicine Reports, The Open Cancer Journal and American Journal of Cancer Research. Awards In 2004 Kundu was awarded a Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, following the receipt of an earlier National Bioscience Award for Career Development in 2003. International Journal of Oncology, Oncology Reports and International Journal of Molecular Medicine Award for an outstanding achievement in Oncology, Greece; International Young Investigator Award, USA. 7th National Grassroots Innovation Award-2013, Rashtrapati Bhavan, New Delhi. Controversy A controversy erupted in the NCCS in 2006 when an anonymous mail alleged that Kundu and others might have misrepresented data in a paper published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. The allegation was that they had rehashed the same set of data which they had published earlier. An internal committee of the NCCS advised the authors to take back their paper, however an independent committee led by G. Padmanabhan, a former director of Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, concluded that there was no manipulation in the data. This led to some heated debate between Indian Scientists with several viewpoints being presented. On 23 February 2007, the Journal of Biological Chemistry withdrew the paper amid allegations of data manipulation, although the authors maintained that the two papers used different set of data though similar experiments. One JBC paper was retracted by JBC because they found the data to be unreliable. In November 2010, after an internal investigation by its ethics committee, the Indian Academy of Sciences banned Gopal Kundu from participating in its activities for three years.

It has a single erect, hairy leaf and up to three red, white and green flowers on a flowering stem up to high. It is a common species on the Swan Coastal Plain, where it grows in sandy soil under trees. Description Caladenia arenicola is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf long and wide. The inflorescence is a raceme, high with up to three flowers, each flower long and wide. The dorsal sepal is erect and the lateral sepals and petal spreads widely and have narrow scent-producing glands on their ends. The labellum is more than wide with long calli along its edges and calli along its centre in four or more roughly parallel rows. Flowering occurs between late August and October and is followed by a non-fleshy, dehiscent capsule containing a large number of seeds. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia arenicola was first formally described by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown in 2001 from a specimen collected near Wanneroo. The description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (arenicola) is derived from the Latin words arena meaning \\"sand\\", and -cola meaning \\"dweller\\" referring to the sandy habitat of this orchid. Distribution and habitat Carousel spider orchid occurs between Lancelin and Yarloop in the Jarrah Forest and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions where it grows in sandy soil in Allocasuarina, Eucalyptus or Banksia woodland.

Trading is conducted amongst members of the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), loosely overseen by the Bank of England. Most of the members are major international banks or bullion dealers and refiners. The physical characteristics of gold and silver bars used in settlement in market is described by the Good Delivery specification which is a set of rules issued by the LBMA. It also puts forth requirements for listing on the LBMA Good Delivery List of approved refineries. Gold trading Internationally, gold is traded primarily via over-the-counter (OTC) transactions, with limited volume trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM) based on the LBMA price. Twice daily, at 10:30 AM and 3:00 PM (local time). the LBMA publishes the gold price in US dollars. These forward contracts are known as gold futures contracts. Spot gold is traded for settlement two business days following the trade date, with a business day defined as a day when both the New York and London markets are open for business. Unlike many commodity markets, the forward market for gold is driven by spot prices and interest rate differentials, similar to foreign exchange markets, rather than underlying supply and demand dynamics. This is because gold, like currencies, is borrowed and lent by central banks in the interbank market. Interest rates for gold tend to be lower than US domestic interest rates. This encourages gold borrowings so that central banks can earn interest on large gold holdings. Except in special circumstances the gold market tends to be in positive contango, i.e. the forward price of gold is higher than the spot price. Historically this has made it an attractive market for forward sales by gold producers and contributed to an active and relatively liquid derivatives market. Market size The bulk of global trading in gold and silver is conducted on the over-the-counter (OTC) market. London is by far the largest global centre for OTC transactions followed by New York, Zurich, and Tokyo. Exchange-based trading has grown in recent years with Comex in New York and Tocom in Tokyo generating most of the activity. Gold is also traded in forms of securities, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs), on the London, New York, Johannesburg, and Australian stock exchanges. Although the physical market for gold and silver is distributed globally, most wholesale OTC trades are cleared through London. The average daily volume of gold and silver cleared at the LBMA auctions in May 2019 was 18.6 million troy ounces (2965 transfers, worth $23.9 billion) and 211.8 million troy ounces (978 transfers, worth $3.1 billion) respectively. The Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee has claimed that clearing data substantially understates the true amount of gold traded due to the netting of trades in the calculation of Clearing Statistics.Paul Mylchreest, Thunder Road Report (PDF) GATA, p. 10; (15 October 2009).

Retrieved 6 May 2011 Account types =Allocated accounts= Allocated accounts are accounts held by dealers in clients' names on which are maintained balances of uniquely identifiable bars, plates or ingots of metal 'allocated' to a specific customer and segregated from other metal held in the vault. The client has full title to this metal with the dealer holding it on the client's behalf as custodian. To avoid any doubt, metal in an allocated account does not form part of a precious metal dealer's assets.Susanne Capano, A Guide to the London Precious Metals Markets Published jointly by the LBMA and the London Platinum and Palladium Market (LPPM), p. 6 (August 2008). Retrieved 21 March 2010 =Unallocated accounts= Unallocated accounts represent the most popular way of trading, settling and holding gold, silver, platinum and palladium. Transactions may be settled by credits or debits to the account while the balance represents the indebtedness between the two parties. Credit balances on the account do not entitle the creditor to specific bars of gold or silver or plates or ingots of platinum or palladium but are backed by the general stock of the precious metal dealer with whom the account is held. The client in this scenario is an unsecured creditor. =Unallocated risks= The total quantity of unallocated gold is estimated to be 15,000 tonnes at the end of 2008Paul Mylchreest, Thunder Road Report (PDF) GATA, p. 11 (15 October 2009). Retrieved 21 March 2010 which supports the 2,134 tonnes on average of spot gold trade through London every day representing 14.2% of the pool. This compares to average daily turnover in UK equities of between 0.34% and 0.63% for the 12 months ending September 2009. While members of the LBMA provide no information on the backing for unallocated gold the improbably high turnover is suggestive they are operating a fractional reserve system where unallocated accounts are only partially backed by physical gold. Similarly to a bank run this makes LBMA unallocated gold accounts susceptible to loss if a sufficient number of market participants request delivery of physical bullion.  Membership  LBMA accepts memberships from companies that deal with business closely related to gold or silver bullion in the London market. Members pay between ¬£5,000 and ¬£12,000 annually depending on membership type. LBMA members come from Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, Poland, Russian Federation, South Africa, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United States, and Uzbekistan. A full membership in the LBMA enables members to expand operations internationally, like it did for VTB Bank, for example. VTB, a Russian-based bank, joined in 2015 as the first full member from Russia and was able to begin expanding into Asian emerging markets as a result. LBMA forecast Each year the LBMA forecast gathers the opinions of selected bankers, traders and analysts who follow the precious metals markets with their forecasts for the high, low and average dollar fixing price per troy ounce for gold, silver, platinum and palladium. The aim of the LBMA forecast is to predict the average, high and low price for each metal as accurately as possible. The prediction closest to the average price wins. In the event of a tie the forecast range is taken into account. In the 2009 LBMA forecast Philip Klapwijk took the prize for most accurate forecaster for both gold and silver prices.2009 LBMA Forecast winners http://www.gfms.co.uk/Press%20Releases/2009%20Price%20Forecast%20Winners.pdf (PDF) (15 January 2010).

History The Abrams Planetarium opened in 1963, and has had an estimated one million visitors since then. As a branch of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at MSU, the Abrams Planetarium is dedicated to teaching astronomy to the public. The planetarium is named after Talbert \\"Ted\\" Abrams and his wife Leota. Ted was a pioneer in aerial photography and Leota made donations to the university. The building was designed by Ralph Calder Associates from Detroit. It has been renovated numerous times both inside and out; the most recent change is the addition of windows in 1995. Talbert Abrams Talbert Abrams was born on August 17, 1896, in Tekonsha, Michigan. During his youth, Abrams had aviation related jobs in Michigan, Ohio, and New York. While in New York, he attended Curtiss Aviation School and graduated in 1916. He received his Federation Aeronautique Internationale Pilot's which was signed by Orville Wright. He joined the US Marines in 1917 and worked on taking aerial photographs of enemy activity. In 1920, he left the Marines to create his own business, ABC Airlines, later the Abrams Aerial Survey Corporation. He later founded Abrams Instrument Corporation, which specialized in designing high-tech aerial photography equipment. During World War II he designed the Abrams P-1 Explorer and Explorer II. After his retirement in 1961, he and his wife traveled around the world several times and visited 96 countries. Abrams died on August 16, 1990. Areas of the Planetarium The planetarium has three main areas: the exhibit hall, the black light gallery, and the sky theater. The main entrance opens into the exhibit hall which is 3000 square feet and has displays including pictures, telescopes, and Earth and moon globes. It also serves as a waiting area for the shows and has a gift shop. The black light gallery is a curved gallery featuring astronomical images painted in fluorescent paint and lit by ultraviolet lights. The sky theater is fifty feet in diameter with a fifty- foot dome. The inside of the dome is made of perforated aluminum and is painted white, it serves as the projection screen. The theater holds one hundred and fifty people and each seat has a different angle of tilt so each viewer has the same view of the projection. The control console is located in the rear of the theater. Spitz Projector When the planetarium was first opened, it was installed with a Spitz Intermediate Space Transit Planetarium projector. The projector was highly advanced for its time, weighing almost 1000 pounds less than similar projectors of its time, allowing it to move in ways most projectors could not. The Spitz projected using lights and lenses, with a star hemisphere map on each end of the projector. Each side of the projector has 4000 holes to represent the night sky and is lit with high pressure xenon gas lamps inside the arc lamps. It duplicates the motions of the five naked eye planets: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. The Spitz was retired in 1993 after thirty years of use. Digistar II Projector Abrams Planetarium now has an Evans and Sutherland Digistar projection system, installed in early 1993 and upgraded to a Digistar II in the summer of 1999. The projector is based entirely on computer graphics. It has a seven-inch monochrome flat screen display with a fish eye lens to magnify and focus the image on the curved ceiling. The Digistar has a resolution of 8000 by 8000 pixels. Its graphics processing computer takes numerical data and manipulates it to compensate for the domed projection surface. It can also rapidly transform shapes and perspectives to create the illusion of motion, for example, travelling through the solar system at a high velocity. Digistar 5 Projector In August, 2014 in celebration of its 50th anniversary, the Digistar II projector was retired and replaced with a fulldome digital system known as Digistar 5. This system uses two digital projectors located on either side of the dome. The new system is in full color and is capable of showing full-dome planetarium shows that are often animated videos warped to fill the dome. It is also capable of simulating the night sky, flying through the universe, importing with 3-D models, and showing high-resolution terrain data of Earth and Mars. It has a projection resolution of 4K. Public Services The planetarium offers a sky watching service called Sky Calendar. It has a sheet for each month and illustrates the positions of the moon, the planets and zodiacal constellations. It has over 10000 paid subscribers and has appeared in issues of Science and Children. It has received awards and good reviews from astronomical publications such as Sky & Telescope, Mercury, and Scientific American. The planetarium hosts monthly meetings for members of the Capitol Area Astronomy Association, a group of hobbyists.

It is published by the Katholisches Bibelwerk (\\"Catholic Bible Society\\") and was compiled from 1962 to 1980 by Catholic theologians with contributions from Evangelical theologians. Collaboration was done on the New Testament and the Psalms. The Evangelical side withdrew support from a project revising the Einheits√ºbersetzung in 2005. Beginnings The compiling of the Einheits√ºbersetzung is a consequence of the reforms of the Second Vatican Council. Vatican II authorized the use of non-Latin languages in the Mass and allowed the local languages into the liturgy. A compilation of new translations of the Bible became urgently needed for the liturgical use in local languages: \\"the Church by her authority and with maternal concern sees to it that suitable and correct translations are made into different languages\\" Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation Dei verbum (Dei verbum, 22) Name and purpose The Einheits√ºbersetzung was supposed to become the uniform Bible of all German-speaking Roman Catholic dioceses. The name \\"Einheits√ºbersetzung\\" reflects this goal. Contrary to a widely spread misunderstanding, the name does not mean that a common translation of the Bible by the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches should be created. Evangelical theologians were indeed involved since the beginning of the work, but a replacement for the Luther Translation of the Bible used by Evangelical churches was never intended. The Einheits√ºbersetzung is designed for the complete religious life, from religious instruction to worship. Linguistic comprehensibility and poetic style were considered. Linguists and experts in liturgy, catechetics, didactics, educational media, and sacred music worked with the theologians to secure the comprehensive usability. The comprehensive introductions to the individual biblical books which include historical Bible criticism, as well as the numerous explanations of the text, contribute to the understandibility and wide application potential. Text Sources The objective of the Second Vatican Council was to produce a \\"suitable and correct\\" translation of the Bible \\"especially from the original texts of the sacred books\\".Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation Dei verbum The preeminence of the Latin Vulgate in the Roman Catholic church up to that point was abandoned. That gave the catholic theologians the challenge of translating from the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek into German, instead of the usual practice of translating the Latin Bible into German. The Roman Catholic Church thus solved one of the conflicts of the Reformation that demanded a return from the Vulgate to the original sources. Testing and Acceptance The translation work lasted from 1962 to 1974, after which the translation was tried in practice then reworked from 1975 to 1978. In 1978, the final edition was accepted by the German Bishops' Conference. Since then, the Einheits√ºbersetzung has proven that it has accomplished its purpose and has become the official text source for religious life in the German-speaking dioceses Ecumenical Meaning and Revision Evangelical theologians from the Evangelical Brotherhood of St. Michael, a part of the Berneuchen Movement, worked on the Einheits√ºbersetzung from the start. They did not yet have an official commission from the Catholic Church. The Evangelical Church in Germany (Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland, abbreviated EKD, which is generally equivalent to the Luthern church in America) was officially requested to work on the translation of the Psalms and the New Testament. In 1970, the Bishops' Conference and the EKD entered a contract for the joint work on the Einheits√ºbersetzung, which was a major breakthrough of the ecumenism in Germany. Since 1980, the Einheits√ºbersetzung has also been approved for use in Evangelical churches and is especially used with the Luther Translation for ecumenical events. In the last few years, the Bishops' Conference has attempted a revision of the translation. The revision was also supposed to be a joint project with the Evangelical church. A conflict between the Roman Catholic church and the Evangelical side arose during the work which resulted in the EKD terminating the 1970 contract in 2005. The conflict arose from disagreements about the Roman Catholic side's push for a heavier emphasis on church traditions than was found in the original text English Translation of the Instructions Liturgiam authenticam and the consensus decision making process used up to that point did not hold, after which common ground between the denominations had to be found. After the completion of the revision it had to be submitted for a Papal Approbation, which was also rejected by the EKD. The new edition (February 2010) prefers gender-neutral wording and does not render the name Jahweh. The reactions to the failure of the joint translation were varied. The Catholic side reacted with incomprehension. The chairman of the Bishops' Conference at the time, Karl Lehmann, spoke of a \\"considerable burden\\" for the ecumenism and suddenly put the blame on the EKD representatives without clarification. The EKD also regretted the development, but explained that it \\"made every imaginable effort to avoid the current result\\" Christof Vetter: Evangelische Beteiligung an der ‚ÄûEinheits√ºbersetzung‚Äú der Bibel nicht mehr m√∂glich. Rat der EKD bedauert Entwicklung; Pressemitteilung der Evangelischen Kirche in Deutschland vom 8. September 2005. According to information from February 2010, the revision of the New Testament is already complete at this point and the work on the Old Testament was so far along that the conclusion is expected in 2011. When the text is complete it must be approved by various committees in the German-speaking Bishops' Conferences and in the Vatican. The length of the approval process cannot be predicted, which is why no publication date can be planned.

An ice nucleus, also known as an ice nucleating particle (INP), is a particle which acts as the nucleus for the formation of an ice crystal in the atmosphere. Mechanisms There are a number of mechanisms of ice nucleation in the atmosphere through which ice nuclei can catalyse the formation of ice particles. In the upper troposphere, water vapor can deposit directly onto solid particle. In clouds warmer than about ‚àí37 ¬∞C where liquid water can persist in a supercooled state, ice nuclei can trigger droplets to freeze. Contact nucleation can occur if an ice nucleus collides with a supercooled droplet, but the more important mechanism of freezing is when an ice nucleus becomes immersed in a supercooled water droplet and then triggers freezing. In the absence of an ice nucleating particle, pure water droplets can persist in a supercooled state to temperatures approaching ‚àí37 ¬∞C where they freeze homogeneously. Cloud dynamics Ice particles can have a significant effect on cloud dynamics. They are known to be important in the processes by which clouds can become electrified, which causes lightning. They are also known to be able to form the seeds for rain droplets. It has become clear that the concentration of ice nucleating particles in shallow clouds is a key factor in cloud-climate feedbacks. Atmospheric particulate matter Many different types of atmospheric particulate matter can act as ice nuclei, both natural and anthropogenic, including those composed of desert dust, soot, organic matter, bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas syringae), pollen, fungal spores and volcanic ash amongst others. However, the exact nucleation potential of each type varies greatly, depending on the exact atmospheric conditions. Very little is known about the spatial distribution of these particles, their overall importance for global climate through ice cloud formation, and whether human activity has played a major role in changing these effects.

The bridge's western end is in Foster City, a suburb on the eastern edge of San Mateo. The eastern end of the bridge is in Hayward. It is the longest bridge in California and the 25th longest in the world by length. The bridge is owned by the state of California, and is maintained by California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), the state highway agency. Further oversight is provided by the Bay Area Toll Authority (BATA). The bridge is part of State Route 92 (SR 92), whose western terminus is at the city of Half Moon Bay on the Pacific coast. It links Interstate 880 (I-880) in the East Bay with U.S. Route 101 (US 101) on the peninsula. It is roughly parallel to, and lies between, the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge and the Dumbarton Bridge. History and description =1929 original bridge= The San Francisco Bay Toll-Bridge Company issued $4,500,000 (equivalent to $ in ) in bonds to raise a portion of the estimated $7,500,000 (equivalent to $ in ) budget required to build the first bridge. First-year operating revenues were anticipated to be $868,469 (equivalent to $ in ), but the original bridge lost money in its first year of operation. The original bridge, known as the San Francisco Bay toll bridge, opened on March 2, 1929 after approximately a year of construction. It was a privately owned venture and was then the longest bridge in the world. The original bridge was mostly a two-lane causeway trestle with five truss spans in the center incorporating a vertical lift over the main shipping channel. Clearance when the lift was down to allow road traffic over the bridge was , and clearance with the lift up to allow marine traffic to pass the bridge was . The original drawbridge played a minor role in the history of the Stanford Axe. When Stanford students stole the Axe back from Cal in April 1930, the getaway car was presumed to be traveling the shortest route, which would be over the bridge, and pursuing Cal students gave chase. The operator on duty, who was a graduate student at Stanford, learned that Cal students were causing the increased traffic in pursuit of the Axe, so he raised the draw and stopped traffic. In fact, the getaway car was traveling back to Palo Alto via San Jose. Although the initial press was favorable, daily traffic fell from the opening months and never exceeded 2,000 cars per day until 1947. The State of California purchased the bridge on September 12, 1951 for $6,000,000 (equivalent to $ in ). By 1955, traffic exceeded 9,000 cars per day, and in 1957, traffic was stopped an average of six times per day to allow ship traffic to pass the bridge. The bridge originally had pole lights along the entire stretch, which were later abandoned except over the vertical lift span. Traffic on the bridge increased from 3,000 cars per day in 1929 to 56,000 cars per day in 1968. Before the new bridge was complete, California put the original truss spans up for sale in 1965, with the buyer obligated to remove all five truss spans after completion of the 1967 bridge. =1967 orthotropic bridge= With increased road and marine traffic, a bill was introduced in 1961 by State Senator Richard J. Dolwig to fund a new fixed high-level bridge to replace the 1929 lift-bridge. The modern span, which began construction on July 17, 1961, opened for traffic in 1967 at a cost of $70,000,000 (equivalent to $ in ). The originally designed upgrade would retain the existing lift span (along with the attendant delays due to passing ship traffic), adding a second deck to the truss spans and widening the existing trestles to four lanes, but the California Toll Bridge Authority added $30,000,000 (equivalent to $ in ) to the project budget in September 1961 to replace the existing lift span with a fixed high-level double-deck span, which would have been similar in appearance to the nearby 1956 Richmond‚ÄìSan Rafael Bridge. By that time, prior phases of the project had already been awarded to relocate the toll plaza from San Mateo to Hayward on new fill and bids were taken for the new eastern trestle, with trestle construction awarded to Peter Kiewit Sons'. The finished single-deck design was not finalized until January 1962, with work initially estimated to complete in 1965. The new span won two prizes in 1968: an ASCE Award for Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement and an American Institute of Steel Construction long-span prize bridge award. William Stephen Allen was retained as an architectural consultant, although the bridge was designed by the Bay Toll Crossings Division (under Chief Engineer Norman C. Raab) of the California Department of Public Works. Chuck Seim, one of the design engineers working for Bay Toll Crossings, would later credit Allan Temko's criticism of Raab's economical truss design for the Richmond‚ÄìSan Rafael crossing for generating sufficient public pressure to drive the single-deck design. Temko's article quoted Tung-Yen Lin as being against a repeat of the Richmond‚ÄìSan Rafael design, but Lin ultimately gave Temko the credit for the design. Raab retired and his successor, E.R. \\"Mike\\" Foley, was willing to incorporate aesthetic considerations, resulting in the final design. The western highrise span features an all-steel superstructure, with an orthotropic deck over two parallel box girders, following the construction of several smaller test bridges using the same orthotropic deck technology. It was the first large- scale use of an orthotropic deck, which reduces weight, and thus seismic loading, although the bridge is expected to receive moderate to major damage following an earthquake. Murphy Pacific Marine built the Marine Boss floating barge-crane in 1966 with a capacity to perform the heavy box girder and deck- section lifts. The heavy lift capacity of Marine Boss enabled Murphy Pacific to raise much longer prefabricated girders than existing barge cranes would have allowed. Box girder and deck sections were fabricated in Murphy Pacific's Richmond yard and were carried by Marine Boss to the bridge construction site. Marine Boss was sold for scrap in 1988 to Weeks Marine in New Jersey, who renamed it the Weeks 533 and refurbished it. Weeks 533 has since been used for several notable heavy lifts, including moving the Concorde and Enterprise onto the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum and lifting the downed hull of US Airways Flight 1549 from the Hudson River. The highrise section of the San Mateo‚ÄìHayward bridge (1967 span). The total length of the bridge is , which is made up of a western highrise section and an eastern trestle section. Approximately of fill were used at the Hayward end to reclaim land for placing the toll plaza and administrative buildings. The eastern trestle span was built on 4,840 prestressed hollow concrete piles, each long. The contractor built a casting yard in Richmond to produce the concrete piles continuously. The new eastern trestle span was completed in 1963 and traffic over the existing 1929 bridge was moved over to it. Work on the western highrise span was bid in October 1964 and commenced in 1965. It crosses a shipping channel, with an orthotropic main span that is long (at the time, the longest girder span in the United States) and has a vertical clearance of . The main span is flanked by two orthotropic back spans which are each long, and there are seven orthotropic side spans on the approach to each back span. Each of these side spans are long. Although these spans appear to be formed from continuous box girders, they consist of alternating anchor spans and suspended spans. Anchor spans rest on top of two adjacent piers and cantilever over each side slightly, and suspended spans are hung between the ends of two adjacent anchor spans. There are an additional nine steel spans carrying a concrete deck on the San Mateo side of the highrise, and ten steel spans carrying a concrete deck on the Hayward side, ranging from . The bridge carries about 93,000 cars and other vehicles on a typical day, almost double its original projected design capacity of 50,000 vehicles per day. The steel deck of the bridge, approximately , was paved with an epoxy asphalt concrete wearing surface in two layers. The San Mateo Bridge was the first deployment of an epoxy asphalt concrete wearing surface. , the original wearing surface was still in use, but was subsequently replaced in 2015. The highrise section was initially built with six lanes and the eastern causeway with four lanes (two in each direction). The causeway section was a perennial traffic bottleneck until it was expanded to six lanes in 2002, along with much needed improvements in its connections with Interstate 880 in Hayward. Bus service over the bridge is provided by AC Transit's Line M Transbay service. San Mateo‚ÄìHayward Bridge (1967), showing some of the electric transmission towers paralleling the bridge route and Werder Pier (at left) The view of the East Bay as seen by eastbound traffic on the descent from the highrise High-voltage power lines built by PG&E; in the 1950s parallel the bridge all the way across the bay. They provide power to the peninsula and San Francisco. =Upgrades and repairs= Seismic upgrades (1997‚Äì2000) The bridge was closed in the wake of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake as a precaution, but reopened on October 18, 1989. It underwent an extensive seismic retrofitting from 1997 through 2000 to protect against earthquake damage. Widening (2002‚Äì2003) The bridge was considered the worst evening commute in the Bay Area, which ended with the completion of a new eastern trestle carrying westbound bridge traffic in 2002. Eastbound bridge traffic took over the old trestle completely, although eastbound traffic was not expanded to three lanes until February 2003. Funded as part of BATA's regional Measure (RM) 1 program, which raised bridge tolls, the new low-rise trestle portion of the bridge added shoulders on both sides in both directions and effectively widened traffic from four to six lanes, matching the configuration of the high-rise portion of the bridge. With the completion of the new westbound trestle, the speed limit on the bridge was raised to . Seismic beam (2010‚Äì2012) A beam, which had been added as part of the seismic retrofit project, was found in a cracked condition during a routine inspection in October 2010. The beam, which was on the westbound approach to (east of) the highrise section, was patched with a steel plate as an emergency repair, and permanent repairs, requiring a weekend shutdown, were completed two years later. Repaving (2015) After nearly forty years of service from the original orthotropic deck wearing surface, Myers and Sons Construction, a partnership between C. C. Myers and Sterling Construction Company, was the selected bidder to remove and replace the wearing surface on the highrise portion in 2015. The work required two full weekend closures on May 8‚Äì11, 2015 and May 22‚Äì25, 2015. The new polyester concrete wearing surface, developed by Caltrans and used to great success in other Bay Area bridges, is anticipated to be at least as durable as the original epoxy asphalt concrete, according to laboratory tests conducted at the University of Missouri-Columbia. The bridge was closed to traffic, for the first time since opening, starting at 10 pm on Friday, May 8, 2015, for resurfacing and maintenance. The bridge reopened before 4 am on Monday, May 11, 2015. It closed again for the final phase over Memorial Day weekend, May 22‚Äì25, 2015, fully reopening by 4:55 am on May 25. =Werder Pier= Werder Pier, the remnant of the original 1929 western trestle span After the new bridge was built, the old bridge was demolished but the western approach (the trestle span up to the original truss spans) was purchased by the County of San Mateo in 1968 for the nominal sum of $10 (equivalent to $ in ) and retained as the Werder Fishing Pier, which was known as one of the best places to catch sharks in San Francisco Bay. San Mateo County operated Werder Pier under a lease agreement with Caltrans, which stated that Caltrans may temporarily revoke the lease in order to use the pier as a staging area for repairs to the 1967 span, and that San Mateo County must maintain the pier and keep it open for public use for 25 years. Werder Pier was closed to the public in 1996, when Caltrans used it as an equipment staging area for the seismic retrofit of the 1967 span. In addition, there were liability concerns since the pier's structure had degraded due to exposure to marine elements. A report was prepared for the county in 2004; the cost of rehabilitating the pier and providing some improvements was estimated at up to $7,200,000 (equivalent to $ in ), depending on a more detailed evaluation of the pier's condition, since the investigation for the report revealed numerous cracks, spalls and exposed reinforcing steel. However, the report also stated the pier did not require any seismic retrofitting. ownership of the parking lot and land access to the pier was transferred to Foster City. Initial concepts for the newly acquired space included a possible ice rink and ferry terminal, but the land was deemed too environmentally sensitive to support high-intensity use. The park carried an interim name of Werder Park, and was dedicated as Bridgeview Park for a grand opening on . Tolls Tolls are only collected from westbound traffic at the toll plaza on the east side of the bridge. Since Jan 2019, the toll rate for passenger cars is $6. For vehicles with more than two axles, the toll rate is $6 per axle. Drivers may either pay by cash or use the FasTrak electronic toll collection device. During peak traffic hours, the two left lanes are designated HOV lanes, allowing carpool vehicles carrying two or more people or motorcycles to pass for a toll of $3. The next three lanes are FasTrak-only lanes. During non-peak hours the two HOV lanes become FasTrak- only lanes. =Historical toll rates= Prior to 1969, tolls on the San Mateo‚ÄìHayward Bridge were collected in both directions. When it opened, the original 1929 span had a toll of $0.45 (equivalent to $ in ) per car plus $0.05 (equivalent to $ in ) per passenger. In 1959, tolls were set to $0.35 (equivalent to $ in ) per car, and remained that amount when the 1967 span was completed. It was raised to $0.70 (equivalent to $ in ) in 1969, then $0.75 (equivalent to $ in ) in 1976. The basic toll (for automobiles) on the seven state-owned bridges, including the San Mateo‚ÄìHayward Bridge, was raised to $1 by Regional Measure 1, approved by Bay Area voters in 1988. A $1 seismic retrofit surcharge was added in 1998 by the state legislature, originally for eight years, but since then extended to December 2037 (AB1171, October 2001). On March 2, 2004, voters approved Regional Measure 2, raising the toll by another dollar to a total of $3. An additional dollar was added to the toll starting January 1, 2007, to cover cost overruns concerning the replacement of the eastern span. The Metropolitan Transportation Commission, a regional transportation agency, in its capacity as the Bay Area Toll Authority, administers RM1 and RM2 funds, a significant portion of which are allocated to public transit capital improvements and operating subsidies in the transportation corridors served by the bridges. Caltrans administers the \\"second dollar\\" seismic surcharge, and receives some of the MTC-administered funds to perform other maintenance work on the bridges. The Bay Area Toll Authority is made up of appointed officials put in place by various city and county governments, and is not subject to direct voter oversight. Due to further funding shortages for seismic retrofit projects, the Bay Area Toll Authority again raised tolls on all seven of the state-owned bridges in July 2010. The toll rate for autos on the San Mateo‚ÄìHayward Bridge was thus increased to $5. In June 2018, Bay Area voters approved Regional Measure 3 to further raise the tolls on all seven of the state-owned bridges to fund $4.5 billion worth of transportation improvements in the area. Under the passed measure, the toll rate for autos on the San Mateo‚ÄìHayward Bridge will be increased to $6 on January 1, 2019; to $7 on January 1, 2022; and then to $8 on January 1, 2025. In September 2019, the MTC approved a $4 million plan to eliminate toll takers and convert all seven of the state-owned bridges to all- electronic tolling, citing that 80 percent of drivers are now using Fastrak and the change would improve traffic flow. On March 20, 2020, at midnight, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all-electronic tolling was temporarily placed in effect for all seven state-owned toll bridges.

It began when the revolutionary Catarino Garza launched a campaign into Mexico from Texas to start an uprising against the dictator Porfirio Diaz. Because of this violation of neutrality, the United States Army became involved and assisted the Mexican Army in tracking down Garza's followers. The war was relatively minor compared to other similar conflicts in Mexican history though it has been seen as a precursor to the major Mexican Revolution from 1910 to 1920.http://cisupa.proquest.com/ksc_assets/catalog/103936.pdf War =1891= The Garza Revolution was one of many outbreaks of rebellion during the four decades of Porfirio Diaz' regime. In September, Garza issued a statement, declaring that the citizens of Mexico were \\"treated like despicable slaves, that the Mexican government was plagued by frightful corruption, that freedom of the press had been squashed, and that the Constitution of 1857 had been betrayed.\\" Garza called on Mexicans to \\"rise in mass in the name of liberty, the constitution and the public conscience.\\" The war began on the night of September 15 when sixty to eighty Garzistas, as they were called, crossed the Rio Grande near Fort Ringgold, Texas to \\"overthrow the Mexican government.\\" Many of the Garzistas were Mexican-Americans, recruited in Texas, known for being criminals before the war which is why they are often referred to as bandits or outlaws. A record of the war was created by American military and civil personnel in letters, telegrams and official reports, much of which has been preserved in a collection by the United States Army. On September 16, Captain E. L. Randall, United States Army, sent a telegram from Fort Ringgold to the army's Department of Texas with news of the event; \\"I have received information that at six oclock last night C. E. Garcia [Catarino Garza] crossed into Mexico when 14 miles below here with over 50 armed men, his object to attempt a revolution\\" Guerilla warfare was a major factor in the conflict as the number of Garzistas remained very small and they blended into the civilian population. They never stayed in Mexican territory for more than a few days and they used horses to ride back and forth across the border, almost with impunity. Over the course of two campaigns, in three years, the Mexican military and the American army engaged in several small skirmishes, all of them occurring within the vicinity of the Rio Grande Valley. The majority of the fighting was between Mexican troops and the rebels in Coahuila but there were also a few encounters between the Americans and the rebels on Texas soil. A racist caricature by Frederic Remington, captioned \\"Third Cavalry Troopers Searching a Suspected Revolutionist.\\" The main authors of the correspondents were Captain John G. Bourke, 3rd Cavalry, Captain George F. Chase, 3rd Cavalry, Captain George K. Hunter, 3rd Cavalry, Captain E. L. Randall, Fort Ringgold, the United States consul at Matamoros, John B. Richardson, Captain F. H. Hardie, 3rd Cavalry, Stephen O‚ÄôConnor, 23rd Infantry, M. Romero of the Mexican legation in Washington, D.C., and P. Ornelas, the Mexican consul at San Antonio, Texas. Captain Bourke's reports of the two campaigns are very descriptive, one of the first was written on October 6, 1891, less than a month after the operation's beginning. In it he describes the difficulties of his mission; \\"The difficulty of the task performed may be inferred from the fact, which is of course well known to the Department Commander, that the population in this valley [Rio Grande Valley] is essentially Mexican‚Äîthe language, dress, customs, weights and measures, money used‚Äîeverything about them‚Äîmay be put down as Spanish, therefore, it is almost an impossibility to separate a revolutionist from one of the ordinary inhabitants.\\" On October 12, Bourke reported the following about the examination of a Mexican village during one of his scouting expeditions; \\"Every house in a suspected locality is examined, names of inmates taken down, number of horses on hand ascertained, and the vicinity examined for fresh horse or wagon tracks, manure, fires, signs of bedding, anything to suggest the recent presence of strangers\\" On November 15, Bourke wrote that the expeditions from Fort Ringgold were \\"without the slightest result, beyond wearing out horses, men, and officers.\\" This was largely due to the fact that the Americans had to search for a small group of locals in sparsely populated wilderness stretching hundreds of miles. Intelligence gathering was poor, Mexican civilians employed as guides were known for being unreliable because of their sympathies with the rebels, as were local peasants the army encountered. The Mexican Army suffered from the same problems as the Americans, leading Bourke to recommend to his superiors that all field commanders speak Spanish so as to better communicate with Mexican authorities and citizens, rather than rely on the guides. The United States Army also employed thirty-five Black Seminole Scouts, from Fort Clark, Texas Rangers and local sheriffs to help track the Garzistas. One of the first battles was fought along the banks of the Rio Grande at San Ygnacio, on December 26, during which a large force of rebels opened fire from the Texas side of the river onto Mexican troops on the other side. The engagement was a long range one and according to an American newspaper correspondent, one Mexican soldier was killed and several people were wounded on both sides. =1892= Major General Frank Wheaton The first campaign occurred between September 1891 and April 1892, by the end of which the Mexican and American militaries were successful in suppressing the rebellion and forcing Garza into hiding in Texas. On January 19, Captain George F. Chase confirmed the weakness of the Garzista forces when he reported the capture of Frank Garza, a relative of Catarino Garza. Frank Garza told Chase that he had served with the rebels for about a month but abandoned them because he was \\"poorly fed\\" and \\"paid nothing.\\" Frank also said that \\"very few men remained with Catarino Garza.\\" The first engagement involving the Americans was just over a week later, on January 31, when three men from the 3rd Cavalry came across a group of rebels. During the ensuing gunfight, one American, mentioned in records only as Glover, was killed and the two others were able to escape. Captain Chase wrote, on February 3, that the men were ambushed at a canyon shaped like a culdesac, adding; \\"it was a terrible place, it is a wonder that any of them got away.\\" About the same time, the Americans learned that because of their patrolling, and the capture of several key leaders, the rebels had broken up into small groups of between two and ten men. The closest the 3rd Cavalry came to catching Garza came on February 18, 1892 when Captain Chase was searching the home of Garza's father-in-law, Alejandro Gonzales. According to a letter dated March 2, 1892, from Captain Bourke, Chase found what he thought to be Garza's shoeprint, leading away from Gonzales' house, but heavy rains helped the rebel escape. Fighting did not resume until December but Garza was no longer leading the rebels, instead they were led by the rancher Francisco Benavides. In November 1892, Benavides signed and issued a proclamation to the people along the international border. The proclamation read in part; \\"We have appealed to reason and he [Porfirio Diaz] has not listened to us; we have appealed to patriotism and he has despised us; let us, therefore, rush to the last recourse which remains to us. Our end is noble, since it contemplates the restoration of our liberty besmirched and defiled by the tyrants of Tuxtepec. Let us leave the plough to grasp in hand the sword and, guided by love of our Fatherland, let us re-conquer upon the field of battle the rights which have been usurped from us under the specious pretext of consolidating that abominable peace which has shed so much blood‚Ä¶. Forward, Mexicans! Let us march to die for liberty. Immortal glory for those who know how to die for her! Scorn and degradation for those who prefer to be slaves rather than patriots!\\" On December 10, Benavides led 131 mounted rebels in a surprise attack on the village of San Ygnacio, Coahuila, opposite of San Ygnacio, Texas. The engagement lasted from 12:00 am to 3:00 pm and proved to be the deadliest of the war as it turned from a battle into a massacre. The commander of American forces, Brigadier General Frank Wheaton, wrote the following in his annual report of military affairs in Texas; \\"[At] about 11 a. m. on the 10th of December, 1892, one hundred and thirty-one bandits [rebels] attacked the troop of the Sixth Mexican Cavalry, under Capt. [Rutillio] Segura, stationed on the river opposite that point. The soldiers [40 men and three officers] were at stables, and were unprepared. Ten men and two officers were killed, and twelve wounded; eleven escaped. The quarters were set on fire and the captain and several soldiers who had been wounded were thrown into the burning buildings by the bandits and burned to death. Of the surviving Mexican soldiers twenty-two, with the women and children, were driven to this side. The wounded were cared for by the citizens of San Ygnacio, Tex. It was claimed by Mexican authorities that these Mexican soldiers were detained there against their will as prisoners, but the matter was repeatedly investigated by officers at the time and such was found not to be the case. Most of these soldiers returned to their own country within a few days.\\"United States, pg. 140-148 Shortly after learning of the attack, General Wheaton ordered troops of the 3rd Cavalry to ride to the country opposite of San Ygnacio, Coahuila and begin searching for the rebels. Beginning on December 19, Wheaton ordered additional forces to occupy the Mexican National Railroad and other locations in the immediate area. Elements of the 7th Cavalry, the 18th Infantry and the 23rd Infantry also took up positions along the Rio Grande to prevent any \\"armed bodies\\" from crossing the international border. On December 24, Lieutenant P.W. West, with a troop of 3rd Cavalry and the Black Seminole Scouts, discovered a trail near San Ygnacio and followed it. At the end of the trail, West found about thirty-five rebels who \\"made a short stand,\\" but fled soon after the Americans returned the fire. One of the Garzistas was killed and a second rebel was wounded. Lieutenant West \\"captured a number of papers and saddles, and burned or destroyed the provisions, etc., that the bandits [rebels] left behind.\\" On December 29, two United States Marshals were captured at Lopeno by forty to fifty Garzistas who rescued one of their imprisoned leaders, named Antonio Palacios. The two marshals escaped though when the Mexican Army found the rebels and engaged them. A letter dated January 2, 1893, from Deputy Marshal Eugene Iglesias to Marshal Rosendo Guerra, reads; \\"On the afternoon of the 29th, they numbering some 40 to 50 men, moved down the river to Lopena [Lopeno], some 18 miles below Carrizo; arriving at Lopena about 8 oclock pm. Some 3 or 4 men came up and informed the captain that they had not noticed any Mexican troops over the river. They went to the river that night, it was a bright moonlight night, the two deputies were placed behind the 10 first men and followed by the remainder of crowd, they began crossing the river when about some 10 or 15 yds from Mexican bank they were fired upon and a general fight began between the bandits [rebels] as they were in the river and the Mexican troops.\\" =1893= Benavides was one of the first prisoners taken by the Americans during the second campaign. On January 21, 1893, a squad from the 3rd Cavalry, under Lieutenant J. T. Dickman, arrested Benavides and another leader named Prudencio Gonzales without a fight on the Mexican side of the border. A day later Lieutenant Dickman came across Cecilio Eschevarria who put up a \\"sharp fight\\" but was ultimately captured. On the same day a rebel named Maximo Martinez, who participated in the San Ygnacio raid, surrendered to a local sheriff. The final engagement of the war to involve the Americans occurred on February 23 in Starr County. According to General Wheaton, Lieutenant P. G. Lowe, 18th Infantry, was out scouting with a former sheriff named Washington Shely and two Black Seminoles when they came across Las Muias Ranch, held by \\"the most desperate of all the bandits\\", Eusabio Martinez, alias Mangas de Agua. Another skirmish ensued and ended with Martinez dead. By March 1893 the war was basically over. Captain Henry Jackson, 7th Cavalry, wrote; \\"The idea of any Revolution against Mexico is gone, but there are some 50 or 60 still out who are implicated in the San Ignacio raid, without money or food and who, on account of this extradition business, and in some cases civil processes, are afraid to surrender; these men are in the brush, roaming from place to place, stopping no 2 days at any one and will simply have to be hunted down. This can be done better I think by a few Seminoles and the Shelys with his deputies than any other way.... Since my last letter Rafael Nielo and Esperantis Ortiz have surrendered here and others are expected today.\\" The United States Army continued making arrests of suspected rebels from April to August, but after September the scouting operations had ceased. General Wheaton reported the capture of 132 individuals during the second campaign, eighty-six of whom were found to have participated in the massacre at San Ygnacio and seventy-one of them were convicted in an American court. Wheaton said; \\"I regret that under our laws more severe punishment can not be given the leaders of such an unlawful raid and brutal massacre as that of December 10 last. Possibly after they have served the sentences awarded by our courts the extradition by Mexico of those guilty of murder and similar crimes may be effected.\\" See also *Yaqui Uprising *Mexican Border War *Bandit War *List of wars involving Mexico References * * Further reading Category:1891 in Mexico Category:1891 in the United States Category:1892 in Mexico Category:1892 in the United States Category:1893 in Mexico Category:1893 in the United States Category:19th-century military history of the United States Category:American frontier Category:Conflicts in 1891 Category:Conflicts in 1892 Category:Conflicts in 1893 Category:History of Texas Category:Military history of Mexico Category:Rebellions in Mexico Category:Wars involving Mexico Category:Wars involving the United States ","title":"Garza Revolution"},{"id":"33662735","text":"Vale is a minor Central Sudanic language of the Central African Republic, spoken in and to the west of the town of Batangafo.

It is believed that between two and four billion years ago, the first ancient bacteria and microorganisms came about on Earth's oceans. These bacteria could fix nitrogen, in time multiplied, and as a result released oxygen into the atmosphere. This led to more advanced microorganisms, which are important because they affect soil structure and fertility. Soil microorganisms can be classified as bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi, algae and protozoa. Each of these groups has characteristics that define them and their functions in soil.Rao, Subba. Soil Microbiology. Fourth ed. Enfield: Science Publishers, 1999. Print. Up to 10 billion bacterial cells inhabit each gram of soil in and around plant roots, a region known as the rhizosphere. In 2011, a team detected more than 33,000 bacterial and archaeal species on sugar beet roots. The composition of the rhizobiome can change rapidly in response to changes in the surrounding environment.  Bacteria  Bacteria and Archaea are the smallest organisms in soil apart from viruses. Bacteria and Archaea are prokaryotic. All of the other microorganisms are eukaryotic, which means they have a more advanced cell structure with internal organelles and the ability to reproduce sexually. A prokaryote has a very simple cell structure with no internal organelles. Bacteria and archaea are the most abundant microorganisms in the soil, and serve many important purposes, including nitrogen fixation.Wood, Martin. Soil Biology. New York: Chapman and Hall, 1989. Print Some bacteria can colonize minerals in the soil and help influence weathering and the breaking down of these minerals. The overall composition of the soil can determine the amount of bacteria growing in the soil. The more minerals that are found in area can result in a higher abundance of bacteria. These bacteria will also form aggregates which increases the overall health of the soil. = Biochemical processes = One of the most distinguished features of bacteria is their biochemical versatility. A bacterial genus called Pseudomonas can metabolize a wide range of chemicals and fertilizers. In contrast, another genus known as Nitrobacter can only derive its energy by turning nitrite into nitrate, which is also known as oxidation. The genus Clostridium is an example of bacterial versatility because it, unlike most species, can grow in the absence of oxygen, respiring anaerobically. Several species of Pseudomonas, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa are able to respire both aerobically and anaerobically, using nitrate as the terminal electron acceptor. = Nitrogen fixation = Nitrogen is often the most limiting nutrient in soil and water. Bacteria are responsible for the process of nitrogen fixation, which is the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into nitrogen-containing compounds (such as ammonia) that can be used by plants. Autotrophic bacteria derive their energy by making their own food through oxidation, like the Nitrobacter species, rather than feeding on plants or other organisms. These bacteria are responsible for nitrogen fixation. The amount of autotrophic bacteria is small compared to heterotrophic bacteria (the opposite of autotrophic bacteria, heterotrophic bacteria acquire energy by consuming plants or other microorganisms), but are very important because almost every plant and organism requires nitrogen in some way.  Actinomycetes  Actinomycetes are soil microorganisms. They are a type of bacteria, but they share some characteristics with fungi that are most likely a result of convergent evolution due to a common habitat and lifestyle.Sylvia, David M., Jeffry J. Fuhrmann, Peter G. Hartel, and David A. Zuberer. Principles and Applications of Soil Microbiology. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 1998. Print. = Similarities to fungi = Although they are members of the Bacteria kingdom, many actinomycetes share characteristics with fungi, including shape and branching properties, spore formation and secondary metabolite production. * The mycelium branches in a manner similar to that of fungi * They form aerial mycelium as well as conidia. * Their growth in liquid culture occurs as distinct clumps or pellets, rather than as a uniform turbid suspension as in bacteria. = Antibiotics = One of the most notable characteristics of the actinomycetes is their ability to produce antibiotics. Streptomycin, neomycin, erythromycin and tetracycline are only a few examples of these antibiotics. Streptomycin is used to treat tuberculosis and infections caused by certain bacteria and neomycin is used to reduce the risk of bacterial infection during surgery. Erythromycin is used to treat certain infections caused by bacteria, such as bronchitis, pertussis (whooping cough), pneumonia and ear, intestine, lung, urinary tract and skin infections.  Fungi  Fungi are abundant in soil, but bacteria are more abundant. Fungi are important in the soil as food sources for other, larger organisms, pathogens, beneficial symbiotic relationships with plants or other organisms and soil health. Fungi can be split into species based primarily on the size, shape and color of their reproductive spores, which are used to reproduce. Most of the environmental factors that influence the growth and distribution of bacteria and actinomycetes also influence fungi. The quality as well as quantity of organic matter in the soil has a direct correlation to the growth of fungi, because most fungi consume organic matter for nutrition. Fungi thrive in acidic environments, while bacteria and actinomycetes cannot survive in acid, which results in an abundance of fungi in acidic areas. Fungi also grow well in dry, arid soils because fungi are aerobic, or dependent on oxygen, and the higher the moisture content in the soil, the less oxygen is present for them.  Algae  Algae can make their own nutrients through photosynthesis. Photosynthesis converts light energy to chemical energy that can be stored as nutrients. For algae to grow, they must be exposed to light because photosynthesis requires light, so algae are typically distributed evenly wherever sunlight and moderate moisture is available. Algae do not have to be directly exposed to the Sun, but can live below the soil surface given uniform temperature and moisture conditions. Algae are also capable of performing nitrogen fixation. = Types = Algae can be split up into three main groups: the Cyanophyceae, the Chlorophyceae and the Bacillariaceae. The Cyanophyceae contain chlorophyll, which is the molecule that absorbs sunlight and uses that energy to make carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water and also pigments that make it blue-green to violet in color. The Chlorophyceae usually only have chlorophyll in them which makes them green, and the Bacillariaceae contain chlorophyll as well as pigments that make the algae brown in color. = Blue-green algae and nitrogen fixation = Blue-green algae, or Cyanophyceae, are responsible for nitrogen fixation. The amount of nitrogen they fix depends more on physiological and environmental factors rather than the organism‚Äôs abilities. These factors include intensity of sunlight, concentration of inorganic and organic nitrogen sources and ambient temperature and stability.  Protozoa  Protozoa are eukaryotic organisms that were some of the first microorganisms to reproduce sexually, a significant evolutionary step from duplication of spores, like those that many other soil microorganisms depend on. Protozoa can be split up into three categories: flagellates, amoebae and ciliates. = Flagellates = Flagellates are the smallest members of the protozoa group, and can be divided further based on whether they can participate in photosynthesis. Nonchlorophyll- containing flagellates are not capable of photosynthesis because chlorophyll is the green pigment that absorbs sunlight. These flagellates are found mostly in soil. Flagellates that contain chlorophyll typically occur in aquatic conditions. Flagellates can be distinguished by their flagella, which is their means of movement. Some have several flagella, while other species only have one that resembles a long branch or appendage. = Amoebae = Amoebae are larger than flagellates and move in a different way. Amoebae can be distinguished from other protozoa by their slug-like properties and pseudopodia. A pseudopodium or ‚Äúfalse foot‚Äù is a temporary obtrusion from the body of the amoeba that helps pull it along surfaces for movement or helps to pull in food. The amoeba does not have permanent appendages and the pseudopodium is more of a slime-like consistency than a flagellum. = Ciliates = Ciliates are the largest of the protozoa group, and move by means of short, numerous cilia that produce beating movements. Cilia resemble small, short hairs. They can move in different directions to move the organism, giving it more mobility than flagellates or amoebae.  Composition regulation  Plant hormones, salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and ethylene are key regulators of innate immunity in plant leaves. Mutants impaired in salicylic acid synthesis and signaling are hypersusceptible to microbes that colonize the host plant to obtain nutrients, whereas mutants impaired in jasmonic acid and ethylene synthesis and signaling are hypersusceptible to herbivorous insects and microbes that kill host cells to extract nutrients.The challenge of modulating a community of diverse microbes in plant roots is more involved than that of clearing a few pathogens from inside a plant leaf. Consequently, regulating root microbiome composition may require immune mechanisms other than those that control foliar microbes. A 2015 study analyzed a panel of Arabidopsis hormone mutants impaired in synthesis or signaling of individual or combinations of plant hormones, the microbial community in the soil adjacent to the root and in bacteria living within root tissue. Changes in salicylic acid signaling stimulated a reproducible shift in the relative abundance of bacterial phyla in the endophytic compartment. These changes were consistent across many families within the affected phyla, indicating that salicylic acid may be a key regulator of microbiome community structure. Classical plant defense hormones also function in plant growth, metabolism and abiotic stress responses, obscuring the precise mechanism by which salicylic acid regulates this microbiome. During plant domestication, humans selected for traits related to plant improvement, but not for plant associations with a beneficial microbiome. Even minor changes in abundance of certain bacteria can have a major effect on plant defenses and physiology, with only minimal effects on overall microbiome structure.  Applications  = Agriculture = Microbes can make nutrients and minerals in the soil available to plants, produce hormones that spur growth, stimulate the plant immune system and trigger or dampen stress responses. In general a more diverse soil microbiome results in fewer plant diseases and higher yield. Farming can destroy soil's rhiziobiome (microbial ecosystem) by using soil amendments such as fertilizer and pesticide without compensating for their effects. By contrast, healthy soil can increase fertility in multiple ways, including supplying nutrients such as nitrogen and protecting against pests and disease, while reducing the need for water and other inputs. Some approaches may even allow agriculture in soils that were never considered viable. The group of bacteria called rhizobia live inside the roots of legumes and fix nitrogen from the air into a biologically useful form. Mycorrhizae or root fungi form a dense network of thin filaments that reach far into the soil, acting as extensions of the plant roots they live on or in. These fungi facilitate the uptake of water and a wide range of nutrients. Up to 30% of the carbon fixed by plants is excreted from the roots as so-called exudates‚Äîincluding sugars, amino acids, flavonoids, aliphatic acids, and fatty acids‚Äîthat attract and feed beneficial microbial species while repelling and killing harmful ones.  Commercial activity  Almost all registered microbes are biopesticides, producing some $1 billion annually, less than 1% of the chemical amendment market, estimated at $110 billion. Some microbes have been marketed for decades, such as Trichoderma fungi that suppress other, pathogenic fungi, and the caterpillar killer Bacillus thuringiensis. Serenade is a biopesticide containing a Bacillus subtilis strain that has antifungal and antibacterial properties and promotes plant growth. It can be applied in a liquid form on plants and to soil to fight a range of pathogens. It has found acceptance in both conventional and organic agriculture. Agrochemical companies such as Bayer have begun investing in the technology. In 2012, Bayer bought AgraQuest for $425 million. Its ‚Ç¨10 million annual research budget funds field-tests of dozens of new fungi and bacteria to replace chemical pesticides or to serve as biostimulants to promote crop health and growth. Novozymes, a company developing microbial fertilizers and pesticides, forged an alliance with Monsanto. Novozymes invested in a biofertilizer containing the soil fungus Penicillium bilaiae and a bioinsecticide that contains the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae. In 2014 Syngenta and BASF acquired companies developing microbial products, as did Dupont in 2015. A 2007 study showed that a complex symbiosis with fungi and viruses makes it possible for a grass called Dichanthelium lanuginosum to thrive in geothermal soils in Yellowstone National Park, where temperatures reach . Introduced in the US market in 2014 for corn and rice, they trigger an adaptive stress response. In both the US and Europe, companies have to provide regulatory authorities with evidence that both the individual strains and the product as a whole are safe, leading many existing products to label themselves \\"biostimulants\\" instead of ‚Äúbiopesticides‚Äù.  Unhelpful microbes  A funguslike unicellular organism named Phytophthora infestans, responsible for potato blight and other crop diseases, has caused famines throughout history. Other fungi and bacteria cause the decay of roots and leaves. Many strains that seemed promising in the lab often failed to prove effective in the field, because of soil, climate and ecosystem effects, leading companies to skip the lab phase and emphasize field tests.  Fade  Populations of beneficial microbes can diminish over time. Serenade stimulates a high initial B. subtilis density, but levels decrease because the bacteria lacks a defensible niche. One way to compensate is to use multiple collaborating strains. Fertilizers deplete soil of organic matter and trace elements, cause salination and suppress mycorrhizae; they can also turn symbiotic bacteria into competitors.  Pilot project  A pilot project in Europe used a plow to slightly loosen and ridge the soil. They planted oats and vetch, which attracts nitrogen-fixing bacteria. They planted small olive trees to boost microbial diversity. They split an unirrigated 100-hectare field into three zones, one treated with chemical fertilizer and pesticides; and the other two with different amounts of an organic biofertilizer, consisting of fermented grape leftovers and a variety of bacteria and fungi, along with four types of mycorrhiza spores. The crops that had received the most organic fertilizer had reached nearly twice the height of those in zone A and were inches taller than zone C. The yield of that section equaled that of irrigated crops, whereas the yield of the conventional technique was negligible. The mycorrhiza had penetrated the rock by excreting acids, allowing plant roots to reach almost 2 meters into the rocky soil and reach groundwater.

The species in this genus are commonly called \\"algae eaters.\\" They hold on to fixed objects using a sucker-like mouth, and, despite the name, feed on a wide range of detritus, rather than simply on algae. A \\"golden\\" variety of G. aymonieri, the Chinese algae eater or \\"sucking loach\\", can be found in many pet shops and fish farms.  Sucker  The mouths of these fish have developed into a suckermouth, which allows the fish to cling onto objects in the fast-moving water of their habitat. They therefore stay close to the bottom, where their primary food, algae, is more readily available. Uniquely among fish, members of this family have gill slits with two openings each. Water enters through one opening, and leaves through the other. This allows the fish to breathe without having to take water in through the mouth, which is in use to cling to surfaces. The Chinese algae eater is sometimes kept in aquaria to control algae. It can range up to 11 in (28 cm) in length and has a reputation for becoming increasingly territorial as it matures, and can also be aggressive to other fish, especially slow, flat- bodied species. In the home aquarium, the Chinese algae eater generally makes a poor tank mate. It can be very boisterous, and when improperly fed, has been known to attack other fish and rip off scales, causing infection. It rarely takes food from the surface of the water as it is a demersal species, and as such an appropriate sinking food should be provided. It is very hardy and can endure water conditions that would be toxic to many other aquarium fish, but it should never be kept in such conditions intentionally. Thriving over a wide temperature range, 64-86 ¬∞F (18-30 ¬∞C), it is frequently kept in unheated indoor aquariums in some climates.

Biography Bryan was born on October 20, 1822, in Ellicottville, New York. By 1833, the family moved to Ohio. He was well educated and read law. His father, John A. Bryan, was a United States diplomat, and his brother-in-law, John B. Weller, was a United States Senator and Governor of California. In September 1851, Bryan ran for District Attorney of Yuba County against incumbent Jesse O. Goodwin. In June 1852, he was elected a delegate to the state Democratic convention held in Benecia, California, on July 20, 1852. In 1854, Bryan was elected as a Democratic member of the California State Senate from the 15th Senatorial district. Afterwards, Governor John Bigler appointed Bryan as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of California to finish the unexpired term of Alexander Wells, which position Bryan held from November 24, 1854, to November 15, 1855. In September 1855, the Democratic Party nominated Bryan for Supreme Court, and the Know Nothing branch of the party nominated David S. Terry, who won the election. Both during and after Bryan's court service, he remained active in Democratic Party politics. In June 1855 and September 1856, he was a delegate from Yuba County to the Democratic Party state convention. By August 1858, he had joined the Anti-Lecompton Democrat branch of the party. In June 1859, near the outbreak of the American Civil War, he attended the Anti-Lecompton Democrat convention, whose factions culminated in the California gubernatorial election, 1859. In 1862, Bryan moved to Nevada, and won a franchise to operate a toll road. In 1863, he was a delegate to the State Constitutional Convention.Join California In November 1864, although a life-long Democrat, he campaigned for the re-election of Republican President Abraham Lincoln. In May 1864, Bryan's prize thoroughbred, Lodi, won a race at San Jose that established her as the fastest horse in the state. On May 23, 1865, at Ocean Race Course outside San Francisco, he raced Lodi against a challenger, Norfolk, and lost. The race was the subject of Mark Twain's short story, \\"How I Went to the Great Race Between Lodi and Norfolk\\". Suffering from severe drinking and gambling problems, Bryan left California to live in Utah. In 1871, he lived in Polk County, Oregon, and raised thoroughbred horses, after having won a large contingency fee case there. In 1875, he returned to Virginia City, Nevada. He died May 14, 1877, in Carson, Nevada, with no wife or children but survived by a brother, Marshall Bryan, of New York.

It is the sole genus in the monotypic family Tetraplatidae. Taxonomy and systematics Since their discovery in the 1850s, there has been disagreement over the phylogeny of the tetraplatids. Some authorities considered that they were aberrant hydrozoans while others thought that they were unusual scyphozoans, cubozoans or staurozoans. Examination of the ribosomal DNA has shown that they are hydrozoans in the order Narcomedusae.

In places the crest of the tuff ring has been flattened off by bulldozing during subdivision in the 1990s. The tuff ring is breached to the north-east, presumably by the sea during the Last Interglacial warm period, about 130,000 years ago, when the sea level was 5‚Äì6 m above the present. The present floor of the crater is about 5 m above present high tide level and slopes down to the edge of Harania Creek estuary on the Manukau Harbour.

Much of the practical, hands-on experience is then gained after graduation. As with any profession, the level of training and mastery of techniques varies with each individual. The knowledge and skills needed to perform procedures not taught or mastered during the typical veterinary education may be acquired by independent study and practice, attending continuing education, or completing a residency program in a field of specialty practice. There are several specialty colleges under the umbrella of the AVMA.American Veterinary Medical Association - American Board of Veterinary Specialties The goal of specialty colleges is to create individuals with more expertise in defined areas of veterinary medicine. Specialty colleges ensure and verify that all members meet requirements in regards to training, knowledge, and skill. A Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Surgeons has completed an approved surgical training program (typically a 3-year residency), met specific training and caseload requirements, performed research and had their findings published, completed credentialing by the ACVS, and passed rigorous examination.

Service consisted of selecting and delivering small collections of books to schools and other locations used to supply books. The former headquarters library, located at the Camden County Courthouse, served mainly as a storage facility. The library declined after World War II, but was revived with a new Commission who appointed a professional librarian and plans for relocation were made. In 1969, the headquarters moved to the Echelon Mall (now known as the Voorhees Town Center) in Voorhees. Then in 1977, the library moved across the street from the mall, where the current headquarters is located. In 2004, the branch was named in honor of M. Allan Vogelson, a county freeholder who developed the facility. Branches Branch locations are: Headquarters (Voorhees), South County Regional Branch (Atco), Bellmawr, Blackwood, Camden, Merchantville, and Westmont. The city of Camden previously had its own city library system. However, in 2010 Camden came close to being the first city in the United States to close its entire library system because of budget cuts. At the last moment, it was saved by the Camden County Library system, which agreed to take over and rescue the threatened branches.

After a short period of adulation at university, he became a writer in the Parliamentary cause and Hartlib Circle member.Barbara Lewalski, The Life of John Milton (2003), p. 210. Life The son of Michael Hall, he was born at Durham in August 1627, was educated at Durham School, and was admitted to St John's College, Cambridge, on 26 February 1646. Hall remained at Cambridge till May 1647, but considered his real merits unrecognised there. He later entered Gray's Inn. Hall was not initially against the monarchy; but his early views were reforming and utopian. He was much influenced by Baconianism and the chance of a renewal of learning.David Norbrook, Writing the English Republic: poetry, rhetoric, and politics, 1627-1660 (2000), p. 169; Google Books. Blair Worden describes Hall as \\"elusive\\" in the period from 1649, but points out parallels with the political development in the views of John Milton.Worden, p. 285. By command of the Council of State he accompanied Oliver Cromwell in 1650 to Scotland. His friend John Davies states that Hall was awarded a pension of ¬£100 per annum by Cromwell and the council for his pamphleteering services. Hall died on 1 August 1656, leaving unpublished works. Thomas Hobbes frequently visited him; another of his friends was Samuel Hartlib. Career and writing ;Early works At the age of nineteen Hall published Hor√¶ Vaciv√¶, or Essays. Some occasional Considerations, 1646, which he dedicated to the master of his college, John Arrowsmith. Commendatory verses in English were prefixed;By Thomas Stanley, William Hammond, James Shirley, and others. Henry More contributed Greek elegiacs; and Hall's tutor, John Pawson, wrote a preface. A biographical notice in Hall's posthumous Hierocles, 1657 by his friend John Davies of Kidwelly declares that these essays made Hall's reputation international. Hall sent a copy to James Howell, whose letter of acknowledgment is printed in Epistol√¶ Ho-Elian√¶. The essays were followed by a collection of poems published at Cambridge in January 1647; they were reprinted by Samuel Egerton Brydges in 1816. Commendatory verses by Henry More and others were prefixed, and the volume was dedicated to Thomas Stanley. The general title-page is dated 1646, but ‚ÄòThe Second Book of Divine Poems‚Äô has a new title-page dated 1647. Some of the divine poems were afterwards included in Emblems with Elegant Figures newly published. By J. H., esquire [1648], 2 parts, which was dedicated by the publisher to Mrs. Stanley (wife of Thomas Stanley), and has a commendatory preface by John Quarles. ;Other literary work In 1647 Hall edited Robert Hegge's In aliquot Sacr√¶ Pagin√¶ loca Lectiones. He contributed to the Lacrimae Musarum (1649) of Richard Brome.Krzysztof Fordonski, Casimir Britannicus.

The prose works of William Drummond of Hawthornden were published through the efforts of Sir John Scott of Scotstarvet, his brother-in-law, and Hall edited the History of Scotland (1655), writing a preface. Other non-political writings were: * ‚ÄòParadoxes,‚Äô 1650, second and enlarged edition in 1653; as \\"J. de La Salle\\". * ‚ÄòHierocles upon the Golden Verses of Pythagoras; Teaching a Vertuous and Worthy Life,‚Äô posthumously published in 1657, with commendatory verses by Richard Lovelace and others. ;Translations In 1647 Hall translated from Latin for Hartlib two works of Johann Valentin Andrea, as A Modell of a Christian Society and The Right Hand of Christian Love Offered.Charles Webster, Samuel Hartlib and the Advancement of Learning (2010), p. 31; Google Books. * A translation of ‚ÄòLonginus of the Height of Eloquence,‚Äô 1652. * ‚ÄòLusus Serius, or Serious Passe-Time.

In 1649, Hall published the tract An Humble Motion to the Parliament of England concerning the Advancement of Learning and Reformation of the Universities. In it he complains that the revenues of the universities are misspent and the course of study is too restricted; he advocates that the number of fellowships should be reduced and more professorships endowed. The line taken was parallel with the writings of Milton and Hartlib on education. With his other works of the period, it helped catch the eye of the political agent Gualter Frost and forward his career as a state-paid writer. Parts of the Method in History were used in the Advancement.Smith, p. 340. His views on the curriculum were practically-oriented and pansophist, closer to those of John Dury;Webster, p. 56; Google Books. the model of Jesuit colleges was preferred to the existing colleges of Oxford and Cambridge, as far as rigour and discipline went.Webster, p. 59; Google Books. ;Journalism In 1648 Hall was writing the Mercurius Britanicus (sic) of the Second English Civil War, not the only time this title was used since there was a Mercurius Britanicus of the First English Civil War also, and the Mercurius Censorius, newsletters published in the Parliamentary interest. Journalism of this period was venal, and writers for hire, and he was paid by William Lilly the astrologer to further his verbal feud with George Wharton.http://www.bartleby.com/217/1505.html Hall's Mercurius Britanicus Alive Again was a response to the revived royalist Mercurius Aulicus, appeared from 16 May, and ran for 16 issues to August. The rival to the Mercurius Britanicus was the Mercurius Pragmaticus of Marchamont Nedham (who, confusingly enough, had edited the first Mercurius Britanicus, but at this time was writing for the royalists). Hall's writing style and Nedham's are judged very similar; and they are believed to have colluded covertly to take opposite points of view. By 1650 Hall and Nedham were both on the side of Parliament in their journalism, with Hall writing for Nedham's Mercurius Politicus.Worden, pp. 59‚Äì60. ;Political writings In 1648 he published A Satire against Presbytery. In Scotland he drew up The Grounds and Reasons of Monarchy, with an appendix of An Epitome of Scottish Affairs, printed at Edinburgh and reprinted at London. His approach to political theory is close to Hobbes in De Cive.Smith, p. 188. Other political pamphlets were *A Gagg to Love's Advocate, or an Assertion of the Justice of the Parliament in the Execution of Mr. Love, 1651, on Christopher Love; *Answer to the Grand Politick Informer, 1653, against John Streater; and *A Letter from a Gentleman in the Country, 1653; this was a piece of apologetics on behalf of Oliver Cromwell and his dissolution of the Rump Parliament.Blair Worden, The Rump Parliament 1648-53 (1977), p. 353; Google Books. The Discoverer has been attributed to Hall or John Canne.Christopher Hill, Milton and the English Revolution (1977), p. 224]. It was a two-part attack in 1649 on the leadership of the Levellers, and is presumed to have been backed by the Council of State.Paulina Kewes, The Uses of History in Early Modern England (2006), p. 270; Google Books.

First recognised in 2010, it includes the Outhwaite Park scoria cone that was first mapped by Hochstetter (1864) and inferred by later geologists to be a late phase vent of adjacent Domain Volcano. Borehole drilling and building excavations in the Grafton-Auckland Domain area during the 1990s and 2000s provided new subsurface geological information that allowed geologists to recognise the buried Grafton Volcano.Hayward, B.W., Kenny, J.A., High, R., France, S., 2011, Grafton Volcano. Geocene 6, 12‚Äì-17. Structure This 1877 hospital building, replaced in the 1960s, was built over a Grafton Volcano scoria cone. The central and western parts of this Grafton Volcano comprise a tuff ring arc surrounding a diameter explosion crater filled with a solidified lava lake (basalt) at least thick, which underlies and surrounds scoria cones that erupted from two vents within the crater (at Outhwaite Park and the east end of Auckland Hospital). Most of Grafton Volcano is buried beneath of volcanic ash that forms the western sector of the adjacent Auckland Domain tuff ring. Neighbouring Domain Volcano Subsurface information suggests that the Domain Volcano probably erupted 5‚Äì100 years after the Grafton Volcano from a separate batch of magma that rose most of the way up the same conduit. The Domain explosion crater erupted east of Grafton Volcano and blasted through and destroyed the eastern arc of Grafton Volcano‚Äôs tuff ring and basalt-filled crater floor, creating its own diameter explosion crater and surrounding tuff ring. Widespread cobble-sized chunks of basalt within the Domain's tuff deposits are probably shattered parts of the Grafton crater floor. The ages of the Grafton and Domain volcanoes were until recently not known precisely, although a tree under the Domain tuff ring was radiocarbon dated at over 50,000 years old.. Recent studies have shown them to be approximately 100,000 years old. The fractures and rubble within the solidified lava lakes of the Grafton and Domain volcanoes now form a significant groundwater reservoir utilised by Auckland Hospital and the Domain. Whether the Grafton and Domain volcanoes are recognised as separate volcanoes or merely two halves of a more complex single volcano is a matter yet to be resolved and agreed upon by scientists.

The organization coordinates projects and competitions focused on humanitarian issues, diplomacy, leadership, innovative teaching, entrepreneurship, STEM, and other academics for schools and youth organizations internationally. About 150,000 educators from 194 countries have registered as members of Global SchoolNet, and about 5.5 million students from 109 countries have participated in GSN projects as of 2020. Global SchoolNet is known for two international competitions, the International CyberFair for students in grades kindergarten through high school, and the U.S. State Department-sponsored Doors to Diplomacy for ages 12 through 19. Global SchoolNet was established in 1984 as Free Educational Mail (FrEdMail) in San Diego, California, where its headquarters still exists. Historical Significance FrEdMail: Global Curriculum Network Electronic Mail Center Original Logo Global SchoolNet was founded by San Diego County teachers Yvonne Marie Andr√©s and Al Rogers. Andr√©s reported the seed for the program was planted in 1983 when she received an Apple IIe computer while teaching at Pacific Elementary School in the Oceanside Unified School District in San Diego county.North County Times-San Diego Union Tribune, \\"Connected Classrooms, Nov. 12, 2006 The computer was one of 10,000 that Apple had donated to California public schools for the program \\"Kids Can't Wait\\".Kids Can't Wait Andr√©s first used the computer in a keypal project with San Diego students and students in England, but soon realized there needed to be a stronger e-learning component. In 1983, Andr√©s began working with Rogers on expanding the idea of connecting schools using e-learning projects. Rogers at the time was a computer specialist for the San Diego Office of Education and was interested in software that could help improve students' writing. That year, Rogers created the software program Free Educational Writer, or FrEdWriter,\\"FrEdWriter Documentation,\\" June Wedesweiler Dodge, Nov. 30, 1985 which prompted students through different writing exercises. To provide a way for students using the FrEdWriter program to write to students in other schools Rogers developed Free Educational Mail, or FrEdMail, in 1985. The FrEdMail Network became the nonprofit FrEdMail Foundation in 1989. More than 150 schools and school districts were using it for free international email access and curriculum services by then.North County Times, \\"Connected Classrooms, Nov. 12, 2006 In 1991 thousands of FrEdMail users gained access to the NSFNET via newly established gateways at two NSFNET mid-level network locations: Merit/MichNet in Ann Arbor, MI, and CERFnet (California Education and Research Federation Network) in San Diego, CA. FrEdMail subscribers began to exchange project-based learning electronic mail with the entire Internet community. The FrEdMail-NSFNET Gateway Software was available free of cost to any mid-level network, college, or university which had an interest in collaborating with local K-12 school districts to bring electronic networking to teachers and students. Through FrEdMail, educators were able share classroom experiences, distribute curriculum ideas and teaching materials, as well as obtain information about workshops, job opportunities, and legislation affecting education.FrEdMail users gained access to the NSFNET At its peak, FrEdMail was used by 12,000 schools and 350 nodesFree Apple II Email School System--Nodes List,Oct 21, 1998 worldwide. When the World Wide Web became available to the public in 1993, the FrEdMail Foundation became the Global SchoolNet Foundation and launched its first website, GlobalSchoolhouse.org. The following year the National Science Foundation also awarded Global SchoolNet a grant to introduce a desktop video-conferencing program called CU- SeeMe.North County Times, \\"Connected Classrooms, Nov. 12, 2006 CU-SeeMe was used for many educational video-conferences and in 1995 by World News Now for the first television broadcast live on the Internet, which featured an interview by World News Now anchor Kevin Newman and Andr√©s.

It contains more than 3,000 annotated listings, making it the oldest and largest online clearinghouse for teacher-conducted international e-learning projects. The Projects Registry is searchable by date, student age, location, curriculum, technology, and collaboration type. Educators worldwide can register to collaborate with partners on project-based learning a wide range of activities. Educators submit ideas for collaborative learning projects to the Projects Registry, which sends out a \\"Call for Collaboration\\" announcement. The number of classes or groups participating in any project varies. In one example of how classrooms collaborate on projects called Thinking Like Santa, elementary students write letters to Santa that are answered by older students at other schools.\\"San Diego Union Tribune, \\"Santa Gets Out Stationery,\\" Dec. 19, 2007 The Thinking Like Santa writing project dates back to 1981 and predates Free Educational Mail (FrEdMail), the predecessor to Global SchoolNet. International CyberFair Global SchoolNet received funding from Cisco Systems, MCI and Network Solutions in 1996 for an educational project for students to create content about their local community. International Schools CyberFair is an award-winning authentic learning program used by schools and youth organizations around the world.EBSco Host Connection, \\"MCI and Cisco Systems sponsor International CyberFair for Schools on the Internet\\" The project is based on the concept of the World's Fair and asks students to create virtual exhibits that highlight their local community's history, leaders, environment, culture or attractions. The underlying theme of CyberFair is to \\"Share and Unite.\\" Youth conduct original research and publish their findings on the Web. Recognition is given to the best projects in each of eight categories. This White House-endorsed program encourages youth to become community ambassadors by working collaboratively and using technology to share what they have learned. Students participate in a unique peer review process to evaluate other projects by using an online evaluation rubric. International CyberFair was endorsed by Vice President Al Gore in 1996, and subsequently by other notable business and political leaders, including Internet architect Vint Cerf.Al Gore's endorsement of CyberFair on YouTube, 1996 More than 15,000 CyberFair projects have been produced by schools representing 109 countries. Affiliate CyberFair programs exist in several countries and include the Taiwan CyberFair and the Philippines CyberFair, which was started by Janette Toral, an internet marketing consultant expert, trainer, blogger, policy lobbyist and entrepreneur. Doors to Diplomacy Challenge In 2002 the U.S. Department of State approached Global SchoolNet to redesign the International CyberFair with a global perspective. According to the State Department's announcement for the 2012 contest, the goal of Doors to Diplomacy is to recognize student-created Global SchoolNet projects from around the world that best teach about the importance of international affairs and diplomacy. The competition is open to youth ages 12‚Äì19 in middle or high school. Projects must focus on one of eight subcategories: leadership traits; peace and democracy; business, trade, and economics; science and technology; safety and security; history of foreign relations; health and environmental awareness; and arts and culture. More than 1,500 projects are archived in the Doors to Diplomacy library and serve as educational resources. Online Expeditions Global SchoolNet partners with explorers who want to share the educational value of their travels with youth. Previous online expeditions have included Dan Buettner's bicycle journey through the Mayan ruins, Wave Vidmar's solo and unsupported trek to the North Pole,Wave Vidmar's North Pole Solo ExpeditionOnline Expeditions: North Pole Solo Expedition Sandra Hill Pitman's climb up Mt. Everest and Roger William's \\"Where on the Globe is Roger?\\" peace journey across six continents.Where on the Globe is Roger Global SchoolNet provides the curriculum and students participate by following field reports and interacting with the explorers along their route. US-Russia Social Expertise Exchange (SEE) Global SchoolNet serves an organizer for the US-Russia Social Expertise Exchange (SEE) Education and Youth working group.Partnership to encourage U.S.-Russian student interaction The US-Russia Social Expertise Exchange promotes collaboration between Russian and US non- governmental organizations, leading to meaningful improvement in the lives of the citizens of both countries. SEE is an expansion of the US-Russia Civil Society Partnership Program (CSPP), which was launched in May 2011. CSPP had grown out of two US-Russia Civil Society Summits held in 2009 and 2010 after Russian and US civil society experts recognized the need for greater collaboration between citizens of both countries. In 2013, the program's name was changed from CSPP to SEE to reflect the expansion of its network of participants and their activities. SEE consists of 11 working groups offering Russian and US NGOs a platform for collaboration across a broad array of thematic topics. In August 2013 the San Diego International Children‚Äôs Film Festival featured the premiere of short documentary about youth promoting community service and volunteerism in San Diego and in Russia. The film \\"CyberFair: Connecting Youth Through Volunteerism,\\" highlights the inspirational efforts of youth who volunteer at local organizations such as the Rancho Coastal Humane Society, the Oceanside Bread of Life, and the La Vida del Mar Senior Home. The eight-minute film can be viewed on YouTube.CyberFair: Connecting Youth Through Volunteerism In August 2014 the SEE Education and Youth group published a report,\\"School and the Community: Collaboration in the Context of New Educational Standards: Experiences of Russia and the United States,\\" written by Russian and American education leaders, revealing successful models for collaboration among schools, nonprofit organizations, and businesses in the context of the new educational standards in Russia and the United States. The publication is addressed to school administrators, education thought leaders, community organizations, and community-oriented businesses. School and the Community: Collaboration in the Context of New Educational Standards: Experiences of Russia and the United States Global Forest Link Launched in 2015, Global Forest Link is an award-winning S.T.E.A.M. (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Math) education program that engages high school and middle school students in the collaborative analysis of local forest health and helps them explore the impact of environmental change factors. Students share results online via photographs and digital stories with peers in other cities and countries, giving them a local and global perspective. The program has connected more than 1,500 students from the United States, Russia, Taiwan, Ecuador, and Nigeria with Global Forest Watch, a 20-year-old worldwide network that uses satellite imagery and other scientific methods to monitor tree-covered areas of the world. OUR PRIDE Education and Film Competition OUR PRIDE Education and Film Competition is a juried short film competition for young filmmakers to create original, relevant, and accurate stories to document LGBTQ people, places, and events that expand understanding and awareness of LGBTQ contributions to society. There are two divisions: Middle and High School Youth (ages 12‚Äì18) and College Students. Filmmakers receive cash awards and their films are screened at the Children's International Film Festival at Comic-Con. The competition was introduced to support the FAIR Education Act, which requires that California K-12 schools provide Fair, Accurate, Inclusive and Respectful representations of people with disabilities and people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender in history and social studies curriculum. \\"Paper Bag Heart,\\" the 2017 winning film produced by Sage Creek High School students, depicts a small 1974 march where participants wore bags over their heads to conceal their identities and can be viewed on YouTube.

Crew of Mk II sat back-to-back in an enclosed cockpit Design and intended use = Models and specifications = Two models of the Chariot were produced: *The first was the Chariot Mark I, produced from 1942, which was 6.8 m (22 feet 4 inches) long, 0.9 m (2 feet 11 inches) wide, 1.2 m (3 feet 11 inches) high, speed and weighed: 1.6 tonnes. It had a maximum diving depth of 27 m. Its motor had three settings: slow, medium and full. Its top speed was about 3.5 knots. The motor was powered by battery which provided endurance of about seven or eight hours at 2.9 knots, depending on current etc. Its control handle was shaped like \\\\infty. The detachable warhead contained 600lbs of Torpex. 34 Mk.I Chariots were made. *The second was the Chariot Mark II, produced from early 1944, which was 30 ft 6 in (9.3 m) long, 2 ft 6 in (0.8 m) diameter, 3 ft 3 in (1 m) maximum height, weight 5200 pounds (2359 kg), max speed 4.5 knots, range 5‚Äì6 hours at full speed, had two riders, who sat back to back. The Mk.II warhead contained 1200lbs of explosives, twice the weight of the warhead on the Mk. I. 30 Mk.II Chariots were made.Hobson, Robert W. Chariots of War Ulric Publishing, Church Stretton, Shropshire, England, 2004, . Pages 61-62 The Mk.II is easily visually distinguishable from the Mk.I in that the crew would sit fully enclosed within the hull save for their heads which would protrude. Both types were made by Stothert & Pitt, crane makers at Bath, Somerset. = Delivery to objective = A Chariot's limited range meant that it had to be transported relatively close to its objective before its crew could ride it to the target under its own power. The warhead, which was detonated by timer, would be detached and left at the enemy ship. The crew would then attempt to ride the Chariot to a rendezvous with a friendly submarinewarfarehistorynetwork.co, Manned Submarines: Italy‚Äôs Daredevil Torpedo Riders, August 26, 2015Human torpedo or be forced to abandon the Chariot and escape by other means. The first attempt to use Chariots operationally was Operation Title. Two Chariots were transported to occupied Norway in October 1942 aboard a fishing vessel, the Arthur, with the objective of attacking the German Battleship Tirpitz in Trondheim Fjord. In order to avoid detection by the Germans, the Chariots were towed submerged under the vessel for part of the way but both worked loose in bad weather and were lost. Later deployment of the Chariot was made by carrying the machines to their point of departure by submarine. In early attempts, tubes were fitted to the deck of a submarine (such as HMS Trooper in the photograph on this page) to contain the Chariots. The tubes were 24 feet 2 inches long and had an exterior height of 5 feet 4 inches. The Chariots sat on wheeled bogeys inside, strapped down until needed. Ten tubes were built in all, three fitted to HMS Trooper, two to HMS P311 and HMS Thunderbolt and one each to HMS L23 and HMS Saracen. Later in the war, due to problems encountered with this method, Chariots were instead secured to the deck of the submarine using chocks. Operational successes Arguably, British operations with Chariots were not as successful as the Italians' operations had been. Nevertheless, interspersed among a number of technical equipment failures and bad luck, there were some notable successes, which are set out below. = Operation Principle: Attack on ships in Palermo harbour = On 3 January 1943 a number of Chariots launched from the submarines HMS Thunderbolt and HMS Trooper attacked and sank the Italian Capitani Romani-class cruiser the Ulpio Traiano in Palermo harbour, and severely damaged the Italian troop ship Viminale. = Operation Husky: Beach reconnaissance = Chariots were not only used for attacks on enemy vessels. In May and June 1943 reconnaissance of potential landing beaches for the allied invasion of Sicily, Operation Husky, was carried out partly by Chariots deployed from the submarines HMS Unseen and HMS Unrivalled. = Operation QWZ: Sinking of the Bolzano = On 2 June 1944 a joint British and Italian (i.e. post-armistice) operation was mounted in order to try to prevent the German military from using the Italian cruisers Bolzano and Gorizia at La Spezia. Of two Chariots launched, one began to leak from its float tank, could not be controlled and was abandoned. The other reached the Bolzano and, with the assistance of Italian frogmen, sank the Bolzano. = Ceylon Secret Operation 51: Phuket Harbour = In 28‚Äì29 October 1944 \\"the only completely successful British Chariot operation\\" occurred when two crews on Mk II Chariots, commanded by Lieutenant Tony Eldridge RNVR, were launched from the submarine HMS Trenchant (commanded by Lt.Cmdr. Arthur \\"Baldy\\" Hezlet, RN) and sank two ships in the harbour of Japanese-occupied Phuket, Thailand.As described by Lieutenant Eldridge in his account of the attack.

Cherian. The film focuses on the atrocities committed against Dalits, women and the environment. It features S. P. Sreekumar, David Briggs and Saritha Sunil in the lead roles while Padmapriya, Prakash Bare and Thampy Antony play supporting roles. Kerala-based environmentalist Kallen Pokkudan appears in another important role in the film which also cast 150 Adivasis. The film was completely shot from Wayanad in Kerala and the cinematography was done by M J Radhakrishnan. The story deals with discrimination against landless Dalits and the politics of suppression of their struggle against the upper castes and other powerful elements locally. Plot The film unfolds in fictional space, in a Dalit settlement called Meppara. It explores the life of a group of displaced Dalits in the Western Ghats of India and probes the new identity politics based on Ambedkarism, gaining momentum among the Dalits in the region, in the milieu of an ongoing land struggle. A band of displaced untouchables in Western Ghats of India embrace Buddhism in order to escape from caste oppression. The on-screen happenings are from the perspective of a youth Sankaran, a Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) dropout, whose insecurity and reticence are in stark contrast to the deep-rooted faith and conviction of his father Kandal Kariyan. Shankaran (S. P. Sreekumar), a young Dalit man, befriends a white gay American lepidopterist Jack (David Briggs), for whom he helps catch butterflies, including the rare and beautiful Papilio buddha, and it turns out the two men are romantically involved. While to the displeasure of Shankaran's elderly father, homosexuality is of little consequence among this Dalit community. Shankaran's father is a communist who feels let down by the failure to achieve equal rights. Meanwhile, Manju, a strong-minded woman who has a job as a rickshaw driver, struggles to avoid prejudice in a male- dominated career. When Manjusree hits a lecherous union leader, and Shankaran is arrested for illegally catching butterflies, the events spark off two acts of violence which politicise and radicalise the community, some of whom are queer, who decide to shun the peaceful tactics proscribed by Mahatma Gandhi in favour of rebellion. The film brings into focus, an example of the epic land struggles, which was fought in various regions of the state and across India, and the oppression of indigenous people by the powerful political and social establishments. It also maps environmental degradation and abuse of pristine mountain habitats by outside forces. Cast *S. P. Sreekumar as Shankaran *David Briggs as Jack *Saritha as Manjusree *Kallen Pokkudan as Kandal Kariyan *Thampi Antony as Ramdasji *Padmapriya as Collector *Prakash Bare as SP Production The film marks the debut of Jayan K. Cherian as a feature filmmaker. A student of Iranian filmmaker Abbas Kiarostami, he had previously done several experimental films and short fictions including Shape of the Shapeless, Love in the Time of Foreclosure, Hidden Things, Soul of Solomon and Capturing the Signs of God. Papilio Buddha is inspired by several events that happened in various Dalit communities in Kerala, including their struggle for land in places such as Chengara, Meppadi, and Muthanga, and its effect on the Dalit population. The director travelled all over Kerala and tried to integrate real life experiences of Dalits, after talking to them.\\"The Butterfly effect\\" The film was shot from Muthanga in Wayanad district, Kerala. Principal photography for the film was completed in 19 days. Release =Censorship= The film was denied censor certification by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). The CBFC stated that the screening rights were denied as the film had visuals and dialogues denigrating iconic leaders including Mahatma Gandhi (In a scene from the film, a group of irate Dalits burn an effigy of Mahatma Gandhi as they oppose attempts by a mainstream political party to take up their cause by going on a fast.), E. M. S. Namboodiripad and Ayyankali apart from visuals of extreme violence and extreme torture of women by police. Jayan K. Cherian says that the ban on the public screening of the film is essentially fascistic in nature.\\"Ban on Papilio Buddha is fascism\\" Cherian says, \\"The Board has listed a number of reasons for denying the certification based on its archaic set of guidelines designed to give overwhelming dominance for the state. Most of the objections are about denigrating Gandhi, Ayyankali, Buddha et al. The perceived denigration seems to be coming from the realistic treatment of the climax scene - dalits' agitation and their confrontation with the police who use force to evict them.\\" The Censor Board had also taken exception to the language used in the film. Usage of extremely filthy language and expletives by numerous characters throughout the film, calling caste names such as 'Pulaya', 'Pulakalli', etc. in a derogatory manner, dialogues denigrating communal sections of the society etc. is what the board noted. \\"The typical and realistic Malayalam used by the filmmaker for the characters in this film may be different from the usual commercial film language but calling it filthy is very subjective. The atrocities the Dalit activists Sankaran and Manju go through in this film are reflections of social injustices happening in our society without exaggeration,\\" explained Jayan.\\"Makers of 'Papilio Buddha' move censor tribunal\\"\\"Papilio Buddha director terms CBFC a draconian institution \\" In January 2013, the board decided to give certification to the film after the makers agreed to mute a controversial speech by Ambedkar in the movie. In the speech, Ambedkar implies that Gandhi was cheating Dalits by denying them an electoral constituency of their own during the Yervada jail fast in 1932. Prakash Bare says, \\"The Censor Board had cited nearly 30 instances. Finally, we agreed to mute the offending speech and also blurring in certain scenes. We agreed as it won't change the structure of the film.\\"\\"Papilio Buddha gets censor certification\\" =IFFK screening= The film was denied a screening at the 17th International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK) which created much controversy. The film was not included in the nine Malayalam films selected for screening in the festival in two different categories. Jayan K. Cherian kicked off the controversy by stating that he was shocked by the decision of the jury headed by director Sibi Malayil. \\"Private screening, especially at the film festivals, needed no censor certificates. The jury had almost taken a decision in the film's favour, but it was averted at the last moment for political reasons,\\" he said.\\"This time, Papilio Buddha out of IFFK\\" =Private screening= A preview of the film was held in Thiruvananthapuram in September 2012. The screening brought a number of Dalit Human Rights Movement (DHRM) activists to the theatre hall. \\"The film has not shown even one-hundredth of the torture borne by us. And now they won‚Äôt even allow our film to be screened,\\" says Thathu, a Dalit who saw the film. About the denigrating remarks about Mahatma Gandhi, the director said, \\"Gandhi has a saintly image created through our educational system and the media. When we brought out a counter-narrative to the official one, there is no space for us. Then how can it be a democracy?\\"\\"Screening the reality\\" =International premiere= Initially banned in India and subsequently certified for theatrical distribution, Papilio Buddha had a world premiere on 19 March 2013 at the 27th London Lesbian & Gay Film Festival organised by the British Film Institute.

He is one of the few outstanding trainers from Asia, and has a reputation especially for his focus mitts training. Early career Tanaka was born in Yamoto, Miyagi (current Yamoto, Higashimatsushima, Miyagi), Japan. At age fourteen when he was in the third grade of high school in 1986, he learned boxing from a former boxer from Chuo University who lived near his family home. He joined Sendai Gym (current Shin-Nihon Sendai Boxing Gym) in the first year of Miyagi Prefectural Fisheries High School. Having finished his five-year amateur career with a record of 18‚Äì5, Tanaka won his professional debut in April 1991, and compiled a 2‚Äì3‚Äì1 record in the featherweight and lightweight divisions by February 1994. Tanaka had adored Sadahiro Gonohe, the president of Hachinohe Teiken Boxing Gym, who is known as a theorist. After his retirement as a boxer, Tanaka started training with Gonohe at his gym to become a boxing trainer. Gonohe taught him how to train with focus mitts there. The gym had a Mexican trainer, and Latinos visited there. At first he had been studying Spanish on his own. Then, a Mexican Spanish teacher, an acquaintance at the gym, came to give him lessons for free. Tanaka also actively participated in the Spanish-speaking people's parties and masses, where he got acquainted with an Argentine family. He lived together with them like a homestay for over a year. Mexico, United States and Argentina By February 1995, Tanaka had mastered Spanish language. He went to Mexico for practice with about 7,100 dollars (in the amount of time) earned by part-time job. He began working in Mexico, but his final destination was Argentina. Tanaka loves Argentina, and boxing in that country. Whenever Tanaka has time to spare, he headed from Mexico to Argentina. When Tanaka was twenty-two years old, then twenty-one-year-old Marco Antonio Barrera came to the gym where he was training, and asked for his focus mitts workout. Barrera was to fight for the world title for the first time in March 1995. After training for the day, Tanaka agreed to become his co-trainer with Rudy P√©rez (1955‚Äì2013) in response to his request. Barrera won that first world title shot. Successively, Tanaka guided him to a victory in the fight against Naseem Hamed in April 2001. During Barrera's rest period, Tanaka observed the teaching methods of a variety of trainers. He learned at gatherings and conferences in Mexico, the United States and Argentina. He also received their guidance to learn the techniques, and coached boxers there. When he started living in Mexico, he heard boxers trained by the International Boxing Hall of Famer Argentine Am√≠lcar Brusa (1922‚Äì2011) saying that they could have lived a happy boxer life since Brusa was in their corners. When Brusa had coached the Golden Boy-promoted boxers in Los Angeles and Big Bear City, California, Tanaka studied under him. Tanaka recognized Brusa as the best master and called him Maestro. He received his guidance every time he met Brusa. Japan In December 2002, Akihiko Honda who has been looking for excellent trainers who can bring out the boxers' ability all over the world, requested him to become a trainer of his Teiken Boxing Gym. Tanaka started to coach in Japan at times other than Barrera's training, and signed a deal with Teiken Boxing Gym in May 2003. (the twenty-first article from the top) While instructing Jorge Linares intensively, (the fifth article from the top) he made some other boxers spar with Barrera, (the fourth article from the bottom) or made them participate in his training camps. In Linares' first world title shot in Las Vegas, Nevada in July 2007, Tanaka served as the chief second among Rudy P√©rez, Rudy Hern√°ndez and Kenny Adams. Just before the gong sounded, Tanaka tapped on his back saying that \\"Thanks for making me a second of the world champion. Let's go\\". Tanaka later told that he changed the plan during the fight and Linares neatly ran it since he was a superior boxer. Tanaka has so far trained the world champions such as Erik Morales, Lorenzo Parra, Edwin Valero, Jorge Linares, Rom√°n Gonz√°lez, Takahiro A≈ç et al. In March 2011, Tanaka's hometown Higashimatsushima was devastated by the T≈çhoku earthquake. His two-story family home's first floor was submerged by the tsunami. Although his family was safe, his nearby relatives were swallowed by the tsunami. However, since A≈ç's first defense was scheduled in early April, Tanaka remained in Tokyo saying nothing about it, and continued training. Tanaka had been chosen for the twenty-second Eddie Townsend Award in 2011, but declined it for personal reasons. Every morning, He has been running and training his abdominal muscles. While he worked as an employee of Teiken Boxing Gym, he also hoped to train boxers in various countries and improve his skill as a boxing trainer. Tanaka visited Brusa in Santa Fe, Argentina in January 2010. He daily went to the boxing gym with Brusa to coach boxers there. After they finished all boxers' workout, Brusa make Tanaka wear gloves to train him. Then, they went to the sports gym run by Brusa's daughter, and talked about the history of boxing or Brusa's own in his room within that gym. He has continued to be a trainer in order to become an Am√≠lcar Brusa. Tanaka wanted to receive the long-term guidance from Brusa, but could not have that time. When he heard that Rudy P√©rez had suffered from a severe disease, he canceled the contract with Teiken Boxing Gym and left Japan for Mexico. He wanted to come back in the original intention not to be puffed up in the comfortable situation.

Known for his outspoken political views, his opinion pieces are among the most widely read in English in Sri Lankahttp://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article- details&page;=article-details&code;_title=71249. His poetry collections and translations of Sinhala texts have also been widely read and acclaimed, and have been frequently shortlisted for the prestigious Gratiaen Award. Early life and education Seneviratne was born in Colombo to Gamini Seneviratne, a civil servant who would retire as the chairman of the Coconut Development Authority, and Indrani Seneviratne, who taught English literature and Greek and Roman civilization in various schools, her longest tenure being at Royal College, Colombohttp://www.island.lk/2007/11/04/features8.html. Both of them were English honours graduates from the University of Peradeniya. Malinda is the second in the familyhttp://malindawords.blogspot.com/2012/10/for-mekela- thirunavakarasu-wherever-she.html. His elder brother is Arjuna and younger sister Ruvani, an acclaimed novelist in the United Stateshttp://www.sundaytimes.lk/090920/Plus/plus_10.html. They were all born to a culture of connoisseurship and appreciation of the arts. Malinda's later forays into literature were therefore initiated by his parents, especially his father, who had got him to write a poem when he was 12 years old about a tune played on the pianohttp://www.rivira.lk/online/2017/09/02/124878. He attended Royal College, Colombohttp://www.island.lk/2002/03/10/featur16.html. He dabbled in several extra curricular activities, with chess and scouting being his main interestshttp://malindawords.blogspot.com/2014/01/recollection-of- battle-of-kings.html. Although initially a student in the Mathematics stream, he eventually won all major awards for English literature. He captained the school chess team in 1983 and under his leadership Royal won the National Championship in 1983http://www.rivira.lk/online/2017/09/02/124878. That year he sat for his A Levels, where he offered Mathematics and obtained results that were probably adequate to secure placement in one of the Science Faculties in the university system. However, he had already opted to sit for his A Levels in the Arts Stream the following year, where again he secured good enough results to enter University. He entered Peradeniya in 1985 and read for a bachelor's degree in sociologyhttps://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/malinda-seneviratnes- trysts-with-the-political/. Owing to his exceptional academic performance in his first year, Seneviratne was selected to an exchange program at Carleton College, Minnesota for a Trimester. During the infamous UNP-JVP bheeshanaya of the eighties, when universities were shut down in Sri Lanka, he decided to apply for scholarships to study in the US. He got a scholarship to Harvard University in December 1988. After completing his bachelor's degree, he returned to Sri Lanka in 1991. After several short-term jobs, including a teaching post in the ELTU, Medical Faculty, Peradeniya University in 1992, he was hired as an Editor at the Agrarian Research and Training Institute in March 1993 before leaving it the following year. He then resumed his higher studies, when upon a friend's advice he applied and was selected to the University of California's School of Urban and Regional Planning in 1994. The following year he moved to Cornell University, to read for a PhD in Development Sociology. However he never completed his PhD. He completed the coursework requirement, but his thesis (titled ‚ÄúJourneying with Honour: In Search of the Vague and Indeterminate‚Äù) had not met with the favor of his committee, which held that he could obtain a terminal masters with minor revisions, but if he wanted to pursue doctoral studies major revisions would be necessary. He decided to return to Sri Lankahttps://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/malinda-seneviratnes-trysts- with-the-political/. Political career =Early forays into politics= Malinda's early initiation into politics and Marxism was through his father, who had been a Trotskyite as an undergraduate, and the newspaper of the Revolutionary Communist League at the University of Peradeniya, Kamkaru Mawatha (‚ÄúThe Path of Labour‚Äù). Nanda Wickramasinghe, a batch-mate of his father who was attached to the League and who regularly visited him, enthralled young Malinda. When he entered Peradeniya in the eighties, however, he found himself disagreeing with the UNP and the JVP, as well as the then emaciated and divided SLFPhttps://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/malinda- seneviratnes-trysts-with-the-political/. Towards 1987, one year before the UNP-JVP bheeshanaya commenced, Malinda began supporting Vijaya Kumaratunga and his newly formed United Socialist Alliance (USA)http://malindawords.blogspot.com/2013/02/remembering-vijaya-25-years- later.html, and though he would later disengage from Vijaya's political beliefs, he felt at the time that he was the only person who could reckon with both sides of the political divide. After his assassination in 1988, Malinda would support Ossie Abeyagoonasekera, who would later leave the US and support the UNP. An even more significant political association with the then newly formed Ratavesi Peramuna, the precursor to the Sinhala Nationalist Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU)http://www.vikalpa.org/?p=21551, would follow his return from Harvard, having falling under the influence of two ideologues he'd known through University: Patali Champika Ranawaka and Athuraliye Rathana Thera. In 1992, an exhibition displaying LTTE, IPKF, and JVP human rights abuses in Matara was attacked by thugs connected to the UNP, which compelled a meeting in Wadduwahttp://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article- details&page;=article-details&code;_title=159191 to discuss what the party members could do next. The meeting was disturbed by the police who, on a tipoff, arrested 15 members including Rathana Thera, Champika, and Malinda and held them for three weekshttp://archives.dailynews.lk/2009/12/17/fea02.asp. Tortured at the orders of a drunken OIC, they took their case to the Supreme Court. The case, Channa Pieris and Others v. Attorney General and Others, would later be archived by the University of Minnesota‚Äôs Human Rights Libraryhttp://hrlibrary.umn.edu/research/srilanka/caselaw/Speech/Channa_Peiris_v_Attorney_General.htm. Justice A. R. B. Amerasinghe, in his judgment, argued that the Ratavesi Peramuna ‚Äúwas not an organisation whose members or adherents were engaged in purposes prejudicial to national security or the maintenance of public order‚Äù and was therefore entitled to freedom of association, the deprivation of which by the police compelled the Court to order the State to pay 5,000 rupees per applicant as compensation. In the meantime, the Ratavesi Peramuna morphed into the Janatha Mithurohttps://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/malinda- seneviratnes-trysts-with-the-political/. =Later political career= After completing his higher education, though only partially, at Cornell University, Malinda continued his association with Ranawaka and Rathana following their formation of the Sihala Urumaya (SU)http://nation.lk/online/2015/08/15/reflections-on-the-sihala-urumaya-that- was.html, the next avatar of the Janatha Mithuro. Malinda supported them and ended up eventually as the party candidate in Jaffnahttp://www.island.lk/2000/09/19/featur01.html. The SU received more votes than the JVP and the Nava Sama Samaja Peramuna and Malinda received just seven preferential voteshttps://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/malinda- seneviratnes-trysts-with-the-political/. He joined The Sunday Island immediately after the election and thereafter was not associated with any political party. However, he was associated with the National Movement Against Terrorism (NMAT)https://thuppahi.wordpress.com/2011/05/22/anuruddha- lokuhapuarachchi-a-story-of-a-girl-a-photograph-and-a-photographer/, which he joined in 2006 on the condition that NMAT would operate independently of the SU. NMAT was a formation launched by those earlier associated with the Janatha Mithuro and it was in effect an agitation front for the SU. His association with NMAT ended about a year later when the propaganda work had helped realise the intended outcome: a national effort to rid the country of the terrorist menace. =Beliefs and advocacy= Malinda's political beliefs have been a mix of Marxismhttp://www.island.lk/2010/06/13/features10.html, nationalismhttp://www.island.lk/2001/08/15/midwee05.html, and liberalismhttp://malindawords.blogspot.com/2016/01/i-say-no-to-sinha-le-and- to-sinhale.html, though he has on separate occasions rejected these ideologies. A firm believer in citizenship unhindered by racial or religious prejudices, he nevertheless remains a staunch opponent of Tamil separatismhttp://www.island.lk/2001/11/01/featur02.html, which has earned him the ire of those who advocate federalism and devolution. His articles to various publications during the war years (from 2000 to 2009) and even afterwards have uncompromisingly taken issue with Eelamist propaganda, particularly the traditional homelands thesis of the LTTE. His nationalist outlook underlines his belief in good governance and democracy. Having written on the dangers inherent in the 18th Amendmenthttp://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article- details&page;=article-details&code;_title=5931, which the government of former Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksa enacted in order to do away with presidential term limitshttp://www.economist.com/node/16992141, he has also frequently discussed the need for independent commissions, institutionalised on paper via the 17th Amendmenthttp://www.island.lk/2003/08/03/featur07.html. He has on several occasions expressed his views on federalism and devolution at various forums, and even submitted certain proposals and recommendations to the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission in 2011, where he noted with respect to separatist propaganda that ‚ÄúA pandering to political realities based on constructed mythologies can tide a country over in the short term but necessarily generate further rupture down the line‚Äù and added that ‚ÄúIn the absence of a robust case for devolution, minority grievances must necessarily defer to the notion of citizenship.‚Äùhttp://malindawords.blogspot.com/2011/07/following-is-complete- of-evidence-given.html Writing career =Early stints: From ‚ÄúThe Island‚Äù to ‚ÄúThe Nation‚Äù= In October 2000, after his return from Cornell University and prior to his engagement with the Sihala Urumaya, Malinda was hired as an ‚Äúunderstudy‚Äù to the then Editor of the Sunday Island, Manik de Silvahttp://www.thesundayleader.lk/2014/06/01/malinda-the-poet/. After a tussle with some disagreeable journalists attached to its Sinhala paper, the Divaina (to which he contributed as well), he left the Island in 2004 and did part-time work as a Copywriter at Phoenix Advertising via an invitation from its Chairman, Irvin Weerackody. In 2006 he was hired as the Deputy Features Editor and Editorial Writer at The Nation upon an invitation by the founder CEO of Rivira Media Corporation (which owned the paper), Krishantha Coorayhttp://www.ft.lk/article/536272/Krishantha-Cooray-assumes-duties-as- Chairman-of-Hilton-Colombo-owning-company. After running into some disagreements there, Malinda was hired as an assistant consultant director of the Secretariat for Coordinating the Peace Process for three months in 2007 and as the consultant director of the Special Media Unit at the Government Information Department from November 2007 to November 2008. From then on, he worked as a freelance writer, submitting a weekly average of 10 or 11 articles to six different publications (including the Daily Mirror and the Daily News), as well as a copywriter at Phoenix, until October 2011, when upon another invitation by Rivira Media Corporation he assumed the role of chief editor at The Nation.http://malindawords.blogspot.com/2014/05/the-nation-above-all.html Through these years Malinda shaped The Nation to a more nuanced format, with sections devoted to poetry, arts columns exploring both English and non- English cultural spheres, and political columns articulating divergent ideologiesnation.lk/online/. It was during his editorship that the paper gave coverage to the infamous milk powder scandal involving Fonterrahttp://www.nation.lk/epaper/sunday/2013/03/24/files/assets/common/downloads/publication.pdf. Not surprisingly, therefore, his editorship at The Nation became his best few years by his own confessionhttp://www.rivira.lk/online/2017/09/02/124878, until 2015 when, thanks to a tussle with the management over their acceptance of a previously sent, and by default invalid, letter of resignation, he vacated his post citing constructive terminationhttps://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/malinda-seneviratnes- trysts-with-the-political/. By then the paper had been shut downhttp://asianmirror.lk/media-quality-watch/item/12383-the-nation-closed- staff-asked-to-take-leave-till-nov-02, to be reshaped and launched as a tabloid later on. =Later stints as poet, translator, and critic= Malinda's interest in literature, sustained by his parents, his school, and later his university, was fermented by his discovery of Pablo Neruda and his Residence on Earth in a bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on the day of Neruda's death (which incidentally happens to be Malinda's birth date, September 23), in the 1990shttp://www.island.lk/2003/09/27/satmag03.html. He was profoundly influenced by Neruda, Garc√≠a M√°rquez, and Eduardo Galeano, as well as his childhood encounters with Western literature, musichttp://archives.dailynews.lk/2011/06/23/fea02.asp, and elocutionhttp://www.island.lk/2003/05/25/featur15.html. His first poetry collection, Epistles: 1984‚Äì1996, was published in 1999. He submitted his poetry, in manuscript form, for the Gratiaen Award on six occasions between 2007 and 2013. Five of these collections were shortlisted: Threads in 2007, The Underside of Silence in 2008, ‚ÄúSome texts are made of leaves‚Äù in 2011, ‚ÄúOpen Words are for Love Letting‚Äù in 2012, and ‚ÄúEdges‚Äù in 2013, while ‚ÄúStray Kites on Stringless Days‚Äù didn't make it to the shortlist in 2010https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/on-winning-the-gratiaen/. He won the Gratiaen Award for \\"Edges\\"http://www.sundaytimes.lk/140525/news/malinda-wins-gratiaen-for- edges-100427.html. Two years earlier, in 2011, he had won the H. A. I. Goonetilaka Award (also with the Gratiaen Trust) for his translation of Simon Navagattegama‚Äôs acclaimed Sinhala novel Sansaranyaye Dadayakkarahttp://www.gratiaen.com/winner_2011_h_a_goonetileke_prize.php, which he first read at Cornell University and translated, in part, for a class exercise on Marx, Nietzsche, and Freudhttp://www.island.lk/index.php?page_cat=article-details&page;=article- details&code;_title=164659. Since his employment at the Sunday Island, Malinda has written on a wide range of topics, from the theatre to the cinema to dance. He has written extensively on artists, including directorshttp://www.island.lk/2002/01/20/featur05.html, paintershttp://www.island.lk/2004/01/12/featur02.html, sculptorshttp://www.island.lk/2002/04/27/satmag02.html, musicianshttp://www.island.lk/2004/01/18/featur07.html, and writershttp://www.island.lk/2001/03/25/featur15.html. His criticism of the local English sphere, over what he considers to be its culture of self- congratulation and self-importance, has been one of his enduring motifshttp://archives.dailynews.lk/2010/06/17/fea02.asp. Personal life Malinda's first marriage in 1994 ended a year later. In 1998 he married Samadanie Kiriwadeniya, who is currently the chairperson of SANASA Development Bankhttp://www.sdb.lk/bord-of-directors-2/. They have two daughters, Mithsandi and Dayadi, who attend school at Ladies College, Colombohttp://www.rivira.lk/online/2017/09/02/124878.

Two years later he became a school principal in Buenos Aires and integrated the following year at the National College of Buenos Aires. He served in several institutions at once, creating a chair of pedagogy in school subprefects and helpers and lecturing and writing about education in various publications. In 1887 he was named director of the School of Buenos Aires, and in 1889 he was sent by the National Council on Education to the International Exhibition in Paris. He used the trip to become familiar with the educational techniques used in Europe, which he detailed in several reports and then applied to the creation in 1890 of the National Institute of Primary and Secondary. In 1893 he founded the magazine The New School Teaching; that vehicle would reform plans such as introducing physical education as part of the curriculum that year. In 1897 he was elected to serve on the commission for renewal of curricula of schools in Buenos Aires, and in 1898 he was appointed inspector of schools under national administration. In 1900, he became the inspector general. In 1902, Pizzurno presented the report to the Ministry of Education, detailing all study plans and methods applied in the country to date and proposing a comprehensive reform. He worked with the Ministry for the next 30 years, while continuing his work as inspector and writing and teaching. It is commonly believed that the headquarters of the Ministry of Education is named after Argentine Pizzurno palace in his honor, but the building is called Sarmiento Palace.

He had a strong impact in the Pedagogical Congress of 1882 where he maintained the position that public education had to be Catholic having a strong argument with Leandro Alem. He opposed Public Education Law #1420 of 1884, that established schooling for children being free, secular, and mandatory. He also opposed and represented the position of the Catholic thinkers against the Law of Civil matrimony of 1888, maintaining that the only type of marriage allowed should be the one performed and recognized by the Catholic Church. He was noted as a good orator. Goyena taught Roman law at the Universidad de Buenos Aires and also worked as a journalist, writing among others for Revista Argentina and La Uni√≥n, which he also edited with Estrada and Trist√°n Ach√°val Rodr√≠guez, where he defended his opposition to the liberal reforms of the government of the time, whose principal exponent was President Julio A.

He was abducted, tortured and murdered for his opposition to the military dictatorship in Argentina (1976-1983). Sergio Karakachoff Biography Karakachoff was born in La Plata, in the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. He attended the Rafael Hernandez National School where he founded the students union and whose library now carries his name. He went on to study at the National University of La Plata (UNLP) where he organized a student group adhering to the principles of university reform that was a precursor of the \\"Purple Strip\\" organisation. In 1963 and 1964, he was Secretary of the Legislative Council of the Municipality of La Plata. In 1965, he became a lawyer dedicated to labor law. After the installation of the military dictatorship called the Argentine Revolution, Karakachoff clearly broke with conservative ideas that held the ideas of Ricardo Balb√≠n (so-called balbinismo) within radicalism, creating the MAP (Movement of Popular Affirmation), related to the socialist group MAP (Argentine Popular Action Movement) which was simultaneously founded by Guillermo Est√©vez Boero. The group would be the basis of the daily paper and political organ \\"En Lucha\\", (Infight) to which Federico Storani was also associated where he wrote opinion pieces that profoundly influenced the generation of '70 highlighting the dependent structure of Argentina and the need for new strategies and policies to drive change through non-violent and democratic means. Karakachoff had been a member of the Uni√≥n Civica Radical since he was young and in 1968 was a member of the National Coordinating Board and the Movement for Renewal and Change in 1972/1973, led by Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n. In 1972, at the UCR National Convention he was one of the drafters of the Electoral Platform of UCR 1972, of advanced socio-democratic inspiration together with German Lopez, Roque Carranza, Bernardo Grinspun and others. In 1973 he ran for National Deputy. In 1975, he proposed the need to fundamentally reform the UCR to transform it into a political party deeply rooted in the working class. In 1975, he joined the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights (APDH) where he became involved presenting hundreds of writs of habeas corpus on behalf of the detained and disappeared, that ran into thousands, from the actions of the 1976 military coup. On September 10, 1976 Sergio Karakachoff was kidnapped by a paramilitary group along with his friend and partner, Domingo Teruggi. Their tortured bodies appeared on September 11, on the roadside in an area called Magdalena on the outskirts of the city of La Plata. Days earlier he had denounced the violence of the military junta in about violence. Memorial The library of the Rafael Hern√°ndez National College in the city of La Plata bears his name.

He is also known for being the only victim of Don Ladislao's War.  Biography  G√≥mez Rojas was born into a modest family and raised by his mother, having been abandoned by both his father and stepfather at an early age. He was born on Calle Agustinas, close to the centre of Santiago de Chile, and the small family later relocated to Calle San Diego. He studied at Manuel Barros Borgo√±o Secondary School. He Took great interest in poetry from a young age, and wrote the greater part of his works between 1912 and 1915. During his early life, G√≥mez Rojas was linked to Protestant Christian sects that opposed the Catholic church's doctrinal and authoritarian hold over Chilean society. However, he soon became interested in ‚Äúintellectual anarchism‚Äù and his writing began to show the influences of Nietzsche and D'Annunzio. This sometimes conflicting progression in the work of a poet who has been described as ‚Äúconsistent and almighty‚Äù is revealed in √ìpera Omnia, which remained unpublished until some years ago. Eventually, during the late 1910s, he became influenced by the aesthetic and artistic avant-garde and became inclined towards writing elegies as an attempt to transcend modernist themes. He participated in various artistic and intellectual groups of 1910s Chile, namely: Los Caimanes, Los Diez, and Los Inmortales, the latter made up of the popular playwright Antonio Acevedo Hern√°ndez, and his closest friends: Manuel Rojas and Jos√© Santos Gonz√°lez Vera, whom he encouraged to write from an early age. Time would reveal Manuel Rojas and Gonz√°lez Vera as some of the best Chilean prose writers of the 20th century, both receiving national literature prizes. Following his untimely death, both wrote about the works and personality of their departed friend. { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"float:right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right:1em; font-size: 85%; background:#FFEFDB; color:black; width:35em; max-width:30%;\\" cellspacing=\\"5\\"  style=\\"text-align: center;\\" Cry for Mercy (excerpt) In this prison where they've taken me, where an unjust law keeps us prisoner: I have imagined tombs where judges and magistrates rotted and now are nothing but dust on this earth (...) they believed themselves the hand of God over Earth, his divine wrath, his fire, his burning whip, today they lie forgotten, in terrible slumber dust, silence, shadow, Oblivion! Oblivion! Oblivion! Jos√© Domingo G√≥mez Rojas, (during his imprisonment) } The only one of his works to have been published during his lifetime was Rebeld√≠as l√≠ricas (1913), in the midst of the social upheaval that was demanding change in Chile's oligarchic society. In 1916, he adopted the pseudonym Daniel V√°squez, which would, however, only last until the following year, when his identity was revealed in the Los Diez magazine by Pedro Prado. The ‚ÄúSelva L√≠rica‚Äù group also featured six of his texts in an anthology published in the same year. They describe him as: As a student at the University of Chile's Pedagogical Institute and School of Law, G√≥mez Rojas participated in the University of Chile Student Federation, but maintained a more militant commitment to the Asamblea de la Juventud Radical (Radical Youth Assembly), a political organisation that served as a point of convergence for many young Chilean revolutionaries of the day. At the same time, he also maintained links with the socialist Chilean Workers' Federation (FOCH) and the Chilean arm of the anarchist IWW.  Imprisonment and Death  Square as seen from the West In July 1920, after the National Workers' Food Assembly (AOAN) called for nationwide action, tensions in the country reached boiling point. Known as Las Marchas de Hambre (The Hunger Marches) these actions intended to demonstrate popular support for changes to legislation proposed by the AOAN and its commissions after over two months' deliberation. So great was the support on the streets, that then President of Chile, Juan Luis Sanfuentes, was obliged to receive delegates of the AOAN, who presented the proposals to him with the expression ‚ÄúHe aqu√≠ la voluntad del pueblo‚Äù (This is the will of the people), and a warning of civil disobedience across the country were these not approved within 15 days. Sanfuentes made a courteous show of accepting the proposals, but the next day named Ladislao Err√°zuriz as Minister of the Interior, who, in a conspiracy later referred to satirically as Don Ladislao's War, would mobilise troops to the border and spread the rumour of an imminent war with Peru and Bolivia. This pretext allowed Sanfuentes to declare martial law. The cities were then taken over by the military, ‚Äúsubversive‚Äù students and workers were put on trial, their leaders tried, beaten, extradited and imprisoned (among them Luis Emilio Recabarren) and, on the 21st of July, the headquarters of the University of Chile Student Federation was attacked and destroyed by soldiers and members of the aristocratic Conservative Youth. Jos√© Domingo G√≥mez Rojas was sent to prison by judge Jos√© Astorquiza L√≠bano, where he was subjected to constant torture and harassment. Under these circumstances, his mental health began to deteriorate, and he was later held in solitary confinement, where his body also began to suffer the effects of abuse and imprisonment. After first being detained in the penitentiary, he was later transferred to La Casa de Orates, the country's first and most notorious mental institution, where, after some time, he was driven to insanity by an undiagnosed bout of meningitis. He died on 29 September 1920, and his funeral was attended by over 50,000 people, a poignant demonstration of the huge political, economic and social crisis to which the country had been subjected by the dominant oligarchy, and of the nationwide support for the demands made by the Marchas del Hambre, a process which transformed Jos√© Domingo G√≥mez Rojas into a symbol. His poem Cry for Mercy, written during his incarceration, was read aloud and circulated during his funeral and became a symbol for anarchist and pacifist groups opposing the country's ruling oligarchy.

Biography He left formal education after the fourth year of primary school, but soon began to develop an interest in mechanics, enjoying discovering for himself the speed ratios produced by connecting oranges of different diameters and rotating them by means of jets of water. These toys lead him to consider new challenges and discover of physical principles in practical ways. In his Valle Nuevo workshop in the village of Mari√±o de Bailadores, he empirically and intuitively learned enough about electricity and mechanics to allow him to create about 50 inventions, some of which were commissions, such as a strawberry-peeling machine and a sieve for categorising garlic, and numerous improvements to various different machines, despite having lost his right hand to a saw in an accident in 1977. He developed water turbines used to generate electricity and to move a carpenter's mechanical instruments such as a lathe or plane. His home was the first house in the area to have electric light, which was generated by a turbine of his own design before the national electric company CADAFE reached his village. For that reason, his hydraulic electricity generator plans were widely used in the villages and houses of the Andes. In 1933, when electricity was installed in Bailadores, Zambrano had already built three electric sugar mills. In 1950 he installed a hydraulic turbine in Canagu√°, which provided that community with electric light until 1.978. He also provided generators to other villages in M√©rida, such as Mucuchach√≠, San Jos√© de Acequias, R√≠o Negro and San Antonio de Estanques, among others. From 1975 Zambrano became known throughout the country due to the efforts of Fruto Vivas and Ra√∫l Esteves Laprea, who created the Luis Zambrano Foundation in 1977 in order to spread the creativity and utility of this inventor's work. The Foundation aimed to stimulate local technology development, founding a school and workshop in Bailadores with everything that Zambrano needed to create and to teach young people in the zone, and creating the Luis Zambrano prize for technological inventiveness, awarded annually by the Ministry for People's Power in Science and Technology (MPPCT), previously known as the National Council for Scientific and Technological Research (CONICIT) In 1983 he was named patron of the 8th Graduating Class of Industrial Engineers of the National Experimental University of T√°chira. In November 1984, the University of Los Andes awarded him the title of Doctor Honoris Causa \\"for his useful creative work\\", the first time that this award had been given to a country man. He was declared an illustrious son of Bailadores, and a street in this M√©ridan village is now named after him.  Inventions  Some of Zambrano's many inventions include: * Independent discovery of the relationship between the circumference and diameter of a circle, i.e. the value of pi. * A 600 amp generator used to solder 3/8 rods. * A large lathe with 13 different thread sizes. * A strawberry peeler. * A foundry with its own furnace. * 20 electricity-generating turbines used in villages, homes and estates to mill sugar cane and thresh coffee and other grains. * 5 coffee driers. * A machine used to dry sewage for fertilizer. * A dual effect turbine with 4 outputs with zero axial effect. * 3 forklift ropeways with turbines and a carrying-capacity of half a ton over half a mile. * A garlic sorting, cleaning and sifting machine, with a capacity of 1,400 kg per hour, which earned him public recognition from the City Council of Bailadores. * A bicycle-powered grinder for grains and bones. * A vertical drill adapted from a car engine. Zambrano taught himself the basic principles and construction of hydraulic turbines and double-effect turbines, the transformation of motors from gasoline to gas- powered, the propulsion of aquatic vehicles, jet propulsion and the workings of combustion engines. From 1950 he dedicated himself to the research and development of his most important invention, a rotating motor or reaction turbine which he named the \\"Turboz√°m\\", also known as a \\"criole motor\\". While a conventional motor is constructed from thousands of parts, the Turboz√°m only has around 20. It uses a single sparkplug and a single four-cycle chamber, and has no connecting rods, pistons, camshafts, valves, carburetor or crankshaft. It consists of rotating parts on a drive shaft that, on rotating, produces compression and expansion aided by the inertia of a flywheel, based on a pair of blades or \\"bailadores\\" that act as pistons, named in honor of his village. These blades replace the rotating cam of conventional motors and are driven by a planetary gear system which forms a combustion chamber between the two blades. The feasibility of this engine has been proven by engineers at the University of Los Andes interested in the subject, but has not been implemented, due to lack of support for blade construction. It could rotate at 5000 rpm. He could not finish developing it for lack of support for the construction of the blades.  Quotations  * Don't wait to understand in order to start to do something, start doing something in order to understand. * Don't let night fall at midday. (Don't stop working in the middle of a job.) * Impossibility doesn't exist, we decide what is impossible. * Mad people have opened the way for the wise. Patron of the 8th Graduating Class of Industrial Engineers at UNET  These young people visited Zambrano at his home and workshop in Bailadores to ask him to accept the role of patron. Later, they brought him to San Crist√≥bal to attend the graduation ceremonies on 26 and 27 August 1983. This is the only known case in which Zambrano agreed to act as a patron. In 1983, a group of students from the Industrial Engineering course at the National Experimental University of T√°chira named Don Luis Zambrano as their graduation patron jointly with one of their professors, Ing. Ind. Juan Jim√©nez. In 2008, to celebrate its Professional Silver Jubilee, members of this graduation class reaffirmed their pride in having Don Luis Zambrano engaging as their patron and promising to disseminate his life and work.

Early life and private career Born in Montreal, Dompierre has worked in the printing sector in 1979.

Councillor Dompierre was first elected to the Montreal city council in 1998 as a Vision Montreal candidate in the east-end division of Maisonneuve. VM won a landslide majority in this election under Pierre Bourque's leadership; after the election, Bourque appointed Dompierre as an associate member of the Montreal executive committee (i.e., the municipal cabinet) with responsibility for economic development.Aaron Derfel, \\"Mayor taps Fortier as chairman: Executive committee is experienced,\\" Montreal Gazette, 13 November 1998, A3; \\"MemberWorks Inaugurates It's New Call Centre - An Investment of $6.7 million creating more than 150 new jobs,\\" Canada NewsWire, 7 June 2000, p. 1.

The cross, 10 September 2010, visible in the background. In front, the barricade wall decorated by the \\"defenders\\" movement. The cross in front of the Presidential Palace in Poland (also known as the Smolensk Cross, ) is a wooden cross which was erected as a memorial to the 96 casualties of the 2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash. It was first moved to a chapel in the Presidential Palace on 16 September 2010 and, on 10 November 2010, was again moved, this time to St. Anne's Church, Warsaw, where it currently resides. The cross was controversial, provoking debate in Polish society and media about the issues of separation of church and state, politics, religion and patriotism. History The cross was erected spontaneously by a group of Polish Scouts on 15 April 2010, five days after the plane accident. Among those killed in the crash was Polish President Lech Kaczy≈Ñski of the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party. Soon after the presidential election, in July 2010, the new Polish president, Bronis≈Çaw Komorowski, from the more centrist Civic Platform (PO) party, requested that the cross be moved to nearby St. Anne's Church. The move was supported by the Scouts who erected the cross in the first place and the archbishop of Warsaw, but criticized by certain groups, as the issue gained notoriety in the Polish media. The cross was to be moved on 3 August but this caused increasingly vocal protests from the PiS supporters, known as the \\"defenders of the cross\\" (pol. obro≈Ñcy krzy≈ºa). Most of the defenders believed that the Smolensk air crash was the result of a conspiracy, in which the new Polish government was involved. The defender movement guarded the cross around the clock. The protesters clashed with the police and the cross was not moved on that day. The situation became a contentious issue in Polish politics, as the defenders gained the support of the PiS party. The defenders of the cross clashed with the young supporters of a secularist counter movement, which maintained that in a secular state a cross has no place in a public space and that it should be removed from its prominent position in front of the Presidential Palace. As the defenders, many of them armed with crucifixes, prayed and sang hymns around the cross, their opponents chanted \\"Go to church\\" and declared the defenders to be \\"Catholic fanatics\\". One of the opponents carried a cross made of beer cans. The two groups were separated by the police who set up metal barriers to prevent clashes. Many were shocked by the rise of the counter movement, as Poland's younger generation had not been considered politically active. On 16 September 2010, the cross was moved to a chapel in the Presidential Palace, this time without a prior announcement, as the government did not want to give the defenders movement an opportunity to prepare for their action. On 10 November 2010, it was moved to St. Anne's Church, Warsaw, where it currently resides. Debate The cross provoked a major debate in Polish society and the media about the correct way to honor the victims of the April air crash, the positioning of a cross in a public place, relations between the Polish State and the Catholic Church, and the actions taken by the Polish government. The cross was seen as a symbol of this debate. Polish media devoted significant attention to the event. In August, all of the major Polish news networks had teams monitoring the situation 24 hours a day. An analysis by the National Broadcasting Council revealed that Polish stations devoted a significant amount of time to coverage of the related events. In regard to news coverage on regular channels, the lead was taken by TVP1 (57 min.), followed by TVP2 (42 min.), TVN (39 min.) and Polsat (35 min.), and for the dedicated Polish news channels, TVN24 (366 min.) was ahead of TVP Info (95 min.). For non-news coverage (discussions, analysis, etc.), the lead was taken by TVN24 (279 min.), followed by TVP Info (249 min.), TVP2 (33 min.). The Catholic Church in Poland was split on the issue; support by many church officials for the removal of the cross has led to their estrangement from the defenders movement.

It is endemic to a small area of the coastal mountains of south-eastern Brazil where its natural habitat is moist forest. It grows on trees as an epiphyte. It is in the same genus as the popular houseplant known as Christmas cactus or Thanksgiving cactus. Description Schlumbergera orssichiana resembles other species of the genus Schlumbergera in that it has leafless green stems which act as photosynthetic organs. The stems (cladodes) are composed of strongly flattened segments, which have \\"teeth\\" of varying shapes along their edges, where there are generally two to three, and at the ends. Individual segments are large, long by wide. Special structures characteristic of cacti, called \\"areoles\\", occur at the end of the segments. The areoles are where the flower buds appear. The large flowers, which open widely, are held at a slight angle to the vertical, with the higher side somewhat different from the lower side (slightly zygomorphic). They usually appear pinkish in overall colour, as the individual tepals shade from white at the centre to red at the tips. Each flower is about long by across. The inner petals are fused at the base to form a short \\"floral tube\\", about long, at the base of which nectar is present. The species can be in flower up to three times a year (August, November and March in cultivation in the Northern Hemisphere). The many stamens are arranged in two series, which is a distinctive characteristic of the genus. The inner stamens are fused at the base to form a short tubular structure. The outer stamens arise from along the floral tube. Each is about long, with white filaments and yellow anthers and pollen. The style is dark red and has a stigma with 6‚Äì8 lobes; the style plus stigma is roughly the same length as the stamens. If the flower is fertilized, a fleshy fruit forms which is greenish yellow to cream with five or six ribs. The dark brown seeds are about 1 mm in diameter. Taxonomy The species was discovered in the wild by Countess Orssich (hence the specific epithet orssichiana) and cultivated in her garden in Brazil, from where specimens were sent to Europe. It was given a scientific name in 1978 by Wilhelm A. Barthlott and A.J.S. McMillan. S. orssichiana has been hybridized in cultivation with S. truncata to create the hybrid S. √ó reginae or S. Reginae Group. Distribution and habitat S. orssichiana occurs only in the coastal mountains of south-east Brazil, in the states of S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, in the southernmost part of the tropics. Sites where it has been found include Morro dos Tr√™s Picos in the Serra do Mar and the Serra da Bocaina. Plants are found at altitudes of around Because of their altitude and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, the coastal mountains have high humidity ‚Äì warm moist air is forced upwards into higher, colder locations where it condenses. S. orssichiana grows on trees (epiphytic). Cultivation S. Reginae Group 'Bristol Queen' S. orssichiana is mainly grown in the form of its hybrids with other species of the genus, particularly the artificial hybrid S. orssichiana √ó S. truncata, which has been called S. √ó reginae McMillan or S. Reginae Group. The hybrid S. orssichiana √ó S. russelliana has also been made in cultivation; it has been given the name S. √ó eprica S√ºpplie.

In the episode, the boys accidentally uncover the true origins of Thanksgiving after watching a History Channel documentary alleging that aliens were present at the original harvest feast in 1621. It parodies the television series Ancient Aliens, the 2011 film Thor and for-profit colleges. The episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker and is rated TV-MA L in the United States. Plot After a lecture from 1/16th Cherokee Indian David \\"Running Horse\\" Sawitski, the boys are assigned to write a report on the history of Thanksgiving. They view a TV show on the History Channel that suggests the first Thanksgiving in 1621 was influenced by the presence of extraterrestrials. Despite Kyle's outrage at the program's arguments, he is outvoted, and the boys use the program as a source for their report. After turning in their reports, agents from the History Channel demand the boys tell them where they got their information on aliens, which matches History's own information. When the boys explain they derived their knowledge from that program, the head agent sees this \\"coincidence\\" as validation of History's theories, and shows the boys' testimonials on a subsequent program, crediting Stan as a \\"History Expert\\", and Kyle as a \\"Professor of Thanksgiving‚ÄîDeVry Institute\\", despite the fact that Kyle is shown arguing against the idea. This incurs the wrath of Sawitski, who, angered at the proliferation of falsehoods about Native American history, shows up at Kyle's house and holds him, Stan and Kenny at gunpoint. Captain Standish of Plymouth, a planet in Canis Major whose inhabitants resemble colonial era American Pilgrims, falls to Earth. On Plymouth, the Pilgrim leader rallies his people, saying that their enemies, the Indians, have raided their stuffing mines, which leads to a stuffing shortage on Earth that causes Cartman to panic. Standish shows up at Kyle's house, kills Sawitski, and asks Kyle for help returning to his planet. After Natalie Portman drives them to a wooded area, Standish shows Kyle a map of five planets: Earth, Plymouth, Indi, Colthenheim and Green Lantern World, which are connected by wormholes that, on the map, resemble the hand-traced drawings of turkeys made by schoolchildren. Standish explains that his people and their enemies were indeed responsible for the first Thanksgiving, and warns Kyle that because the 300-year treaty between Plymouth and Indi has ended, the Indians will plunder the Plymouth stuffing mines. Agents from the History Channel appear, and when they tell Standish that they failed to open the wormhole to Plymouth by drawing the turkey symbol at Plymouth Rock, Standish informs them that they need Natalie Portman, who is the Keeper of the Portal. After being wined and dined by Kyle, Portman \\"opens her wormhole\\", sending Standish back to Plymouth, where he vanquishes the Indians. Back on Earth, Standish's campaign against the Indians is related in another History TV special, which also adds the new theory that the first Thanksgiving was haunted, much to Kyle's outrage. Production and cultural references In the creator commentary for the episode, Trey Parker and Matt Stone said that this was the first idea they came up with for the season and intended to save it for the last episode. However as they struggled to come up with other ideas and planned to make the Thanksgiving special two- parts before abandoning the idea. Reception The episode received mixed to positive reviews. Ryan McGhee of The A.V. Club graded the episode a \\"B\\", stating: \\"Tonight's South Park spent absolutely no time dwelling on the events of last week, favoring instead an attack on The History Channel, apophenia, and Natalie Portman. When people think back on this season, this won't be an episode that will immediately spring to mind by any stretch. But as far as silly episodes written and drawn by people who have seen a lot of Thor recently, this wasn't bad.\\" Ramsey Isler of IGN gave the episode a 7.5 out of 10, stating: \\"The story wasted no time getting into its parody of the so- called 'history' channel. The aim is placed squarely on Ancient Aliens specifically, and the direction is nicely done. The tone of the parody shifts as the episode turns into an odd sort of spoof/homage of the Thor movie. We've got the Native Americans as the Ice Giants and the Pilgrims as the Asgardians, and Natalie Portman tacked on for seemingly no real purpose. Overall it's still an entertaining watch, but if it had more focus it could have been something really special.\\" Johnny Firecloud of CraveOnline gave the episode a 5 out of 10, opining that it was not funny, likening the episode to \\"an acid trip laced with way too much strychnine\\". Firecloud sympathized with those who feel that the series is \\"an overloaded mess\\", and thought this episode a rationale for possible series cancellation. Erik Kain of Forbes praised the episode's jabs at for-profit colleges DeVry and the University of Phoenix.

Recent studies have shown that a significant proportion of some genomes (including mouse and human genomes) synthesize RNA that apparently do not code for proteins. The function of most of these non-coding RNA still has to be ascertained. Various genomic methods are being developed to map the functional association of these novel RNA to distinct regions of the genome to gain a better understanding of their function. ChiRP-Seq is one of these new methods which uses the massively parallel sequencing capability of 2nd generation sequencers to catalog the binding sites of these novel RNA molecules on a genome. Overview of method Tens of oligonucleotide probes are designed to be complementary to the RNA of interest. These oligos are labeled with biotin. Cells are cross-linked by UV or formalin and nuclei are isolated from these treated cells. The isolated nuclei were lysed and the released chromatin was fragmented by sonication to produce approximately 100-500 bp sized fragments. These chromatin fragments were hybridized to the biotinylated probe set. Complexes containing biotin-probe + RNA of interest + DNA fragment are captured by magnetic beads labeled with streptavidin. Overview of a next generation sequencing method to characterize RNA binding sites to chromatin. Chromatin isolation by RNA purification. DNA is isolated from an aliquot of the bound complex by treatment with RNAse (or proteinase followed by RNAse) to digest associated protein and RNA. RNA may also be isolated from an additional aliquot of the bound complex to detect other RNA molecules associated with the RNA of interest. The purified DNA is then used to prepare a sequencing library and the library is sequenced on a next generation DNA sequencing system. The sequencing reads are then mapped to the genome. A pile-up of reads at specific locations on the genome indicates that the RNA of interest had bound to that region of the genome. This helps delineate specific genomic regions that interact with RNA. For example, genomic targets of enhancer RNA which act at a distance from their site of synthesis can be easily evaluated by ChiRP-Seq.

He is a painter and illustrator, who regularly exhibits his work at Sartorial Contemporary Art and other galleries. As \\"the Vessel\\", he is songwriter and singer of the cult art-rock band, David Devant and his Spirit Wife. Side projects have included Carfax, a collaboration with Jyoti Mishra, Glam Chops, a glam rock band formed with Eddie Argos of Art Brut, This Happy Band and Mikey Georgeson and the Civilised Scene. Georgeson has also performed and recorded on his own, as Mr Solo. Peter Kimpton, writing in The Guardian praised Georgeson's \\"impish genius for melody\\". Ashley Hames, in the Huffington Post, described Georgeson as 'an original British songwriter of lasting quality. He remains a presence somehow transcendent and other-worldly, bringing us songs that seem to have always existed, holding up the mirror to connect us to something we can truly love.' Art After a childhood in Bexhill-on-Sea and Horsham, Mikey Georgeson attended Worthing College of Art (1985‚Äì86) and Chelsea School of Art (1986‚Äì1989), where he studied illustration when it was a figurative painting course. In 1989, he moved to Brighton, for a postgraduate illustration degree at Brighton University (1989‚Äì91)., Artist's biography from the website of the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool. As an illustrator, he published a series of quirky screenprinted booklets, which he sold in Brighton gallery shops. A Shady Tale (1993) contained a series of unlikely shadowgraphy images. The Hat He Mistook for His Wife (1993), reversing the title of Oliver Sacks' famous book, showed a fedora hat in various marital situations ‚Äì covered with confetti, posing for a honeymoon photograph beside the Eiffel Tower, on a caravanning holiday, and being weighed on bathroom scales. Georgeson lectures in art at the University of East London, and is a practising painter. He has exhibited his work in the following group exhibitions: 'Wapobaloobop', Transition Gallery London 2008, 'Legends of Circumstance' Whitecross Gallery London 2009, Bargate Gallery Southampton 2010 and the Liverpool Biennial 2010. In London, he has had three solo shows: 'My Magic Life' Sartorial Art 2008, 'Father, Son & Holy Smoke', Bear Gallery 2009, and 'Tragicosmic' at Sartorial Art in 2010 Georgeson describes his paintings, which use thickly applied bright oil colours, as \\"a distillation of a desire to capture what I consider to be episodic globules in the glistening, sticky fluid called paint.\\" With My Magic Life, his 2008 exhibition inspired by magic and David Devant, he brought the different strands of his work together. Georgeson explained in the exhibition catalogue: In June 2012, Georgeson exhibited a new solo show, 'Trope' at the Royal Standard in Liverpool. According to the gallery website, Georgeson identifies the 'Trope' as 'the crack that opens between the audience (life) and the artist (art). Eleven paintings in the show focus on Georgeson's ongoing love of Liverpool Football Club as a trope through which he can explore 'sending an emissary from his adult rational self to mix with the transcendental awe of his childhood'. He taps into memories of his boyhood bedroom in which his father had created a large scale recreation of the Kop, pasted together with faces cut from the Observer Magazine.' In 2014, Georgeson began a doctorate in fine art, which he was awarded by the University of East London in 2019. In June 2015, he exhibited his first year paintings in the 'East London Artists' show at the UEL. At the opening, he staged a live performance with the accordionist, Martin White, singing the song \\"Is David Bowie Happy?\\". Georgeson explained, 'The show explores the idea that David Bowie saved his disciples from anomie (Is there life on Mars?) but potentially at the cost of the individuation of his psyche. In the face of the vacuum of meaning created by post-history culture, rather than resorting to appropriate irony, meaning becomes the mystery of creation itself.' The Deadends The Deadends is a 'made up culture', which Georgeson has investigated in a series of exhibitions, printed matter, and a film, The Deadends ‚Äì in Search of Truth. This was shown at the ICA in May 2016, as part of Film is Dead - 100 Years of Dada. On the Deadends website, Georgeson asks, 'Who or what were the Deadends or deadEnds depending on whom you‚Äôre speaking to? What exactly is the meaning behind the signature shapes and forms analysts have chosen to name them after?....Unfortunately the deadends left behind no written evidence or documentation of their culture or thought process leaving scholars to project or speculate as to the exact structure of their intended passage through their geographic specificity.' On 23 February 2017, Georgeson held a celebration of the Deadends in the Studio One Gallery in Wandsworth. Alongside artefacts (abstract paintings and sculptures), the event featured 'speculative enactment as well as...the first ever discoveries of... artifacts.'  The Sensorium  Georgeson is co-curator (with Dean Todd) of the annual Sensorium art show in east London. This event exhibits alongside the Affect and Social Media conferences organised by the digital media critical theorist Tony D Sampson. Georgeson's work also features prominently (alongside other Sensorium contributors) in the book Affect and Social Media: Emotion, Mediation, Anxiety and Contagion. Music In Brighton, in May 1992, Georgeson formed his first band, David Devant & His Spirit Wife, with Foz Foster, ex-guitarist of the Monochrome Set, Jem Egerton, a classically trained musician, who played bass, and drummer Graham Carlow. Georgeson took the name for his band from a second- hand copy of My Magic Life, the autobiography of the great English stage magician, David Devant. A Devant show was conceived as an act of invocation, in which the spirit of the late magician would speak through Georgeson, and the songs would summon down the Spirit Wife. In concert, Georgeson performed as \\"the Vessel\\", wearing a black pompadour wig and a pencil moustache. The elaborate stage show created a false impression that the band was a novelty act. But, as a songwriter, Georgeson was easily the equal of any of his Britpop contemporaries. In 1997 the band released their first album, Work, Lovelife, Miscellaneous. Its tour was accompanied by a Channel 4 film crew from The Other Side series. The documentary, shown in 1999, marked a farewell to the first incarnation of David Devant as, in the final sequence, filmed in 1999, Georgeson symbolically set fire to his wig. In 2001, while Devant were not performing, Georgeson began to work with Jyoti Mishra of White Town, whom he met at a Devant concert. As Carfax, they released two albums, Momento from a Digital Age and Minky Pauve. According to Georgeson, the band took its name from 'the centre of Horsham where the last public hanging took place'. In 2005, Georgeson began to perform as a solo act. Using the stage name Mr Solo, he accompanied his new songs with backing tapes while playing ukulele, keyboards or acoustic guitar. As Mr Solo, he has released two albums, All Will Be Revealed (2006) and Wonders Never Cease (2009). Mr Solo has performed at live art events, as a member of The School of English Dada and Daniel Lehan's This Happy Band, a group of roving musicians, inspired by medieval troubadours. As part of Margate's 'Dead Season Live Art' festival of 2010, This Happy Band paraded 'around the seaside town, commemorating its past, and the themes of Winter Dormancy, and Glorious Resurrection'. In 2011, in honour of the Royal wedding, he performed with the English School of Dada, at Cabaret Voltaire, the home of Dada, in Zurich. In London, he has appeared at three other live art events: 'Mr Solo' Whitechapel Gallery (2009), 'Return of the Repressed' Portman Gallery (2009) and 'Artist As Scapegoat' Norn Projects (2010). In 2008, Georgeson collaborated with Eddie Argos to create Glam Chops, inspired by the stomping rhythms of The Glitter Band and the image of Sweet. The critic Simon Price described the new band: \\"Think Evel Knievel jumpsuits, Red Indian head-dresses and star-shaped warpaint, think lyrics about Bowie vs. Gary rivalry, think parping saxes and stomping stack-heeled beats.\\" The band released a Glam cover of Bruce Springsteen's \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\", with a video showing Georgeson and Argos singing the song while driving down the M4. The version was a showcase for their different singing styles, with Argos speak-singing the verses, and Georgeson providing a soaring operatic refrain. There was also a Christmas single, \\"Countdown to Christmas\\", released as a free download. In 2012, Georgeson began to make music with Rob Jones (The Voluntary Butler Scheme), Simon Love, Simon Breed, Arec Koundarjian, Nathan Thomas, Iain McCallum and Ben Handysides. The new band, called The Civilised Scene, released a single \\"Moth in the Flame\\"/\\"Bringing Rocks Back from the Moon\\" (Corporate Records). In 2013, the band recorded for a new label, Popianosz, releasing a single, \\"Candy Floss\\". Georgeson has said, 'With the Civilised Scene there's a similar thought process as with the paintings.' Debut album Blood and Brambles was released in 2014 to positive reviews. In 2015, Georgeson brought out a retrospective compilation album, The Best of the Vessel, including music recorded throughout his career. Ashley Hames, writing in the Huffington Post, described the album as a 'blinding triumph....it seems that only now are critics reassessing the undeniable pop sensibilities of David Devant & His Spirit Wife. And hearing the songs on this album, it's an absolute wonder that it has taken so long. 'This is For Real' and 'Pimlico' are hidden classics that, back in the day, would have sat comfortably on top of the charts. With hooks that could snare a whale and lyrics packed with pathos, they'd still be perfect additions today. I could repeat that for most of the songs here. This album is that good. There are particular gems: 'Life on a Crescent' is a heartbreakingly delicate and perfectly formed reflection on suburban life. 'Going To London' and 'My Heroine' are quite simply two of the purest pop songs I've ever heard. Best of all though is 'Half of It'. Again, it's a great tune, but significantly it's a new release, and a wonderful sign that even though this album is a retrospective, it shows us that perhaps only now are we really seeing the very best of Mikey Georgeson.'

The site of the battle is near that of the earlier Battle of Arbedo, both in the territory of the current-day municipality of Arbedo-Castione in the Swiss canton of Ticino. History The cause of both battles was the contest for control of the nearby fort of Bellinzona, which at the time happened to be at the point of overlap of the spheres of influence of the Old Swiss Confederacy and the Duchy of Milan. Control of Bellinzona was the strategic key to controlling the Gotthard Pass and the valleys of Ticino and Misox. Uri had won Bellinzona in 1419, but lost it again as a result of the battle of Arbedo of 1422. Uri launched a renewed campaign to regain the valleys in the southern Alps in 1439, and in 1441 forced Milan to yield the Leventina (which had already come under Swiss control in 1430). The unstable situation in the Duchy of Milan with the death of Filippo Maria Visconti in 1447 and the formation of the short-lived Golden Ambrosian Republic encouraged Uri to push forward as far as Bellinzona once again. Milan charged Condottiere Giovanni della Noce with leading the campaign against the Swiss and re-establish Milanese control over the Sottoceneri. Della Noce defeated the force of Uri near Castione, in a battle which lasted for most of the day. The village was burned down, and Uri was forced to retreat to the Misox. Milan secured control over Bellinzona and the Riviera. A formal peace treaty was enacted in 1450, and in 1466, Milan agreed to grant the Leventina to Uri permanently. The defeat at Castione halted Swiss expansion south of the Alps for several decades, until the Confederate campaign of 1478, and the Swiss victory in the Battle of Giornico in 1487. In Swiss historiography, the account of the battle of Castione was corrupted, because historian Theodor von Liebenau (1840-1914) confused it with the battle of Castiglione Olona (1450), which led to the dissolution of the Ambrosian Republic. Proper identification of the battle was left to historians of the 20th century (Chiesi 1979). References * *G.

History and words  In his fourth year in Leipzig, Bach wrote the cantata for the 21st Sunday after Trinity. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians, \\"take unto you the whole armour of God\\" (), and from the Gospel of John, the healing of the nobleman's son (). The cantata opens with the first stanza of the chorale \\"\\" (1674) by Samuel Rodigast, but it is not a chorale cantata in the strict sense of Bach's second cantata cycle, cantatas on the stanzas of one chorale. He had then treated the same chorale completely in (1724), and would do it later once more in (1732). The text of the chorale concentrates on trust in God, whereas the two cantatas previously composed for the occasion, , and , both started from doubt and distress. The poet Christoph Birkmann refers to general ideas from the gospel. He stresses that a prayer for salvation will be granted, in movement 4 according to , \\"knock, and it shall be opened unto you\\", and he continues in movement 5, paraphrasing Jacob in , \\"I will not let you go, except you bless me\\". This final movement is not a chorale, although its text begins like one, Christian Keymann's \\"\\" (1658). Bach first performed the cantata on 10 November 1726. It is regarded as part of his third cantata cycle.  Scoring and structure  The cantata in five movements is intimately scored for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor and bass), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two oboes, taille (tenor oboe), two violins, viola, and basso continuo. # Chorus: # Recitative (tenor): # Aria (soprano): # Recitative (alto): # Aria (bass):  Music  The cantata is scored like chamber music, especially compared to the chorale cantatas on the same chorale with a melody by Severus Gastorius. In the opening chorus, the mostly homophonic setting of the voices, with the oboes playing colla parte, is complemented by strings dominated by the first violin as an obbligato instrument rather than an independent orchestral concerto. The final line is in free polyphony, extended even during the long last note of the tune. All voices have extended melismas on the word \\"\\" (govern), stressing that God is \\"ultimately in control\\". Strings and voices alternate in the bar form's two Stollen, but are united for the Abgesang. Both recitatives are secco. The first aria is accompanied by an obbligato oboe. The first two measures of its theme are derived from the chorale tune. The ritornello is repeated after a first vocal section, \\"cease weeping and remain patient\\", and a second time, concluding a different vocal section, which renders \\"God's resoluteness\\" in a stream of triplets in the voice. The second aria is the final movement, dominated by the violins in unison in a similar structure as the first, two vocal sections framed by repeats of a ritornello. Bach hints at the regular closing chorale by beginning the vocal part with an embellished version of the first line of the hymn \\"\\" on a melody by Andreas Hammerschmidt on the same words as the cantata text.

Development Founded on 27 April 1914 the Ostdeutsche Albatroswerke G.m.b.H. at Schneidem√ºhl by Otto Wiener and Dr. Walter Huth, the OAW maintained close ties with Albatros, remaining an independent company until October 1917. The majority of OAWs work involved licence manufacture of products from the parent Albatros company. Given the company designation L4, one of the few homegrown designs was the Albatros G.I a four-engined heavy bomber inspired by the Sikorsky Ilya Muromets. The G.I was of typical construction for 1915, with wooden structure, wire-braced and covered with fabric and four engines mounted in nacelles on the lower wing upper surface. First flown on 31 January 1916 by Alexander Hipleh, flight trials revealed not only poor flying qualities, but also poor performance, which resulted in further development being abandoned. The later G.II and G.III were not directly related to the G.I, being twin-engined, a lot lighter and having completely different wing designs.

Described in 2006 from Ypresian stage (Early Eocene) deposits, all three of the described species and one unplaced fossil are from British Columbia, Canada, while the second unplaced fossil is from Washington State, USA. These ants were large, with the largest specimens collected reaching . The behaviour of these ants would have been similar to extant Myrmeciinae ants, such as solitary foraging, nesting either in the soil or trees, and leaving no pheromone trail to food sources. Due to the poor preservation of these ants, their phylogenetic position among Myrmeciinae is unclear, and no type species has been designated. These ants are classified as incertae sedis in Myrmeciinae, but some writers have classified it as incertae sedis within the insect order Hymenoptera. This reclassification, however, has not been accepted; instead, Myrmeciites remains in Myrmeciinae. History and classification Fossils of Myrmeciites were first studied and described by Bruce Archibald, Stefan Cover and Corrie Moreau of the Museum of Comparative Zoology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. They published their 2006 description of the form genus (which is a collection of species formally described but cannot be identified to genus level) in an Annals of the Entomological Society of America journal article. The genus name is a combination of the ant subfamily name \\"Myrmeciinae\\" and the Latin suffix \\"ites\\", meaning \\"having the nature of\\", which is commonly used in the naming of fossil taxa. Its phylogenetic position within Myrmeciinae is unclear, due to the incomplete and poor preservation of the collected specimens. The paper that described the form genus included the description of three species, including Myrmeciites herculeanus, Myrmeciites(?) goliath, and Myrmeciites(?) tabanifluviensis. Archibald and colleagues classified Myrmeciites as incertae sedis (Latin for \\"of uncertain placement\\") within the ant subfamily Myrmeciinae, as the specimens are too poorly preserved to be assigned to any tribe. However, in a 2008 paper, Cesare Baroni Urbani of the University of Basel, Switzerland, classified Myrmeciites as incertae sedis within the insect order Hymenoptera (which comprises the sawflies, wasps, bees and ants) because the critical characters used to identify Myrmeciinae ants, or even the family Formicidae cannot be carried out on Myrmeciites. Despite these comments, a 2012 report by Russian palaeoentomologist Gennady M. Dlussky does not make any comment in regard to Baroni Urbani's views; instead, he accepts the classification of Archibald and colleagues. Description Archibald, Cover, and Moreau erected the form genus as an encompassing category for all fossil ants which, while belonging to the subfamily Myrmeciinae, lack details needed for placement in other described genera. This may be due to preservation quality or positioning of the individual ant resulting in obscured details. As Myrmeciites is a form genus it does not have a designated type species per the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. =M. herculeanus= M. herculeanus was described from a single side of a compression fossil found at the Middle Ypresian McAbee Fossil Beds, Kamloops Group, near Cache Creek, British Columbia. The incomplete specimen numbered UCCIPR L-18 F-974, is currently preserved in the paleontology collections housed at the Thompson Rivers University, Kamloops, British Columbia. Archibald, Cover, and Moreau coined the specific epithet \\"herculeanus\\" from the Latin name \\"Hercules\\" in reference to the notably sturdy and large morphology of the type specimen, and after the divine hero Heracles in Greek mythology, who was the son of Zeus and Alcmene. The species is discernible from the other species of Myrmeciinae by its notably larger size, the worker caste ant is estimated at over in life. Its size is comparable to ants in the genus Ypresiomyrma. The shape of the petiole, a narrow waist that is located between the mesosoma and gaster is distinct from other species and is similar in structure to the genus Prionomyrmex though the shape and size of the mandibles are distinct. Overall, M. herculeanus was assigned to Myrmeciinae due to its mandible length, despite them being poorly preserved, and due to the appearance of its petiole and propodeum. The legs are long in comparison to its body length, and the gaster is robust. It is unknown if the species had a sting, due to the preservation of the specimen. The size of the single known worker is larger than any of the studied queens; as Myrmeciinae queens are slightly larger than the other castes in a species, this indicates M. herculeanus is most likely a distinct species. Due to the incomplete nature of the type specimen, the species was placed in Myrmeciites. =M.(?) goliath= The second species described from the McAbee Fossil Beds is M.(?) goliath and as with M. herculeanus, it is known from one specimen, though both the part and counterpart are known for M.(?) goliath. The holotype is housed in the Thompson Rivers University, Kamloops, collections as UCCIPR L-18 F-999 and UCCIPRL-18 F-1000 for each side respectively. The species name \\"goliath\\" was chosen by Archibald, Cover and Moreau in reference to the mythological Goliath, due to the notable size of the ant. The holotype specimen is a partial worker or queen which is incomplete, with a notable portion of the gaster missing. The species can be separated from other ants by the large size, the holotype approaching . The only other Eocene ants in this size range are members of the genus Titanomyrma, that were formerly placed in Formicium. M.(?) goliath is distinguishable from Titanomyrma by the shape and structure of the antennae and length of the legs, which are notably shorter in Titanomyrma. The head is very round and flattened, compound eyes are present and the mandibles are small, less than half the length of the head. The head is also small in proportion to the mesosoma. The legs are large and long, and a poorly preserved petiole is known. Most of the specimen is preserved in fine detail, but some characters are so poorly preserved that the exact placement of M.(?) goliath within Myrmeciinae cannot be confirmed. Only future fossils that are better preserved can clarify the position of M.(?) goliath. =M.(?) tabanifluviensis= Unlike the other described Myrmeciites species, M.(?) tabanifluviensis is the only species not from the McAbee Fossil Beds. The holotype, currently deposited in the Courtenay and District Museum paleontology collections as 2003.2.10 CDM 034 was recovered from shale of an unnamed formation outcropping near the town of Horsefly, British Columbia. The specimen is incomplete with both the head and portions of the mesosoma and gaster missing. The adult had an estimated length in life of over . The right portions of the legs are well preserved while the left legs are missing with two metatibia spurs, one of which is long and the other is short and narrow. Due to the incomplete nature of the specimen and position of the preserved portions, the gender is not identifiable, though the presence of wings indicates it to be a reproductive adult. The small size of the specimen, with a fore-wing length of approximately , separates this species from other members of the British Columbia Myrmeciinae. The type locality for the species, near the Horsefly River, was the basis for Archibald, Cover and Moreau choosing the specific epithet tabanifluviensis, combined with the horsefly genus name Tabanus, the Latin word fluvius meaning \\"river\\" and the sufix -ensis meaning \\"origin\\" or \\"place\\". The justification of placing this ant in Myrmeciites is due to incomplete preservation. =Unplaced specimens= Two additional specimens were placed within the form genus but not into a specific species. The Courtenay and District Museum specimen 2003.2.9 CDM 03 a&b; is a long partial male recovered from the Falkland site, near Falkland, British Columbia. The generally robust nature of the specimen excludes it from the genus Avitomyrmex, but the details needed for placement between the genera Ypresiomyrma and Macabeemyrma are not present. The Stonerose Interpretive Center specimen \\"SR 05-03-01\\" is a possible queen or worker which would have been an estimated long in life. Due to the lateral preservation of the specimen, most characters for placing the specimen into one of the defined species are obscured or absent. The specimen was recovered from outcrops of the Klondike Mountain Formation north west of Republic, Washington. Ecology Archibald and colleagues suggested that the behavioural habits for Myrmeciites ants, like that of other extinct Myrmeciinae taxa, may have been similar to its extant relatives. Workers would forage onto trees or vegetation to capture arthropod prey or to feed on nectar, soiling either in the ground or in the trees, making them an arboreal nesting insect. Like other Myrmeciine ants, Myrmeciites most likely did not lay pheromone trails or recruit nestmates to food sources; these ants may have been solitary foragers, relying on their eyes to hunt for prey and for navigational purposes. The nuptial flight of M. (?) tabanifluviensis probably occurred during the late spring or summer, as in extant relatives.

Run by the American government until 2006, Berlin's Amerika Haus is one of many Amerika H√§user located across Germany. On September 25, 2006, the Amerika Haus Berlin was officially handed back to the city of Berlin and its doors were closed to the general public until 2014. The Development of the Amerika Haus Berlin The destruction of libraries, bookstores, and other collections of literary material both before and during the Second World War led to the emergence, post-1945, of a need for diverse reading material within Germany. At this time the American armed forces within German cities established \\"American Reading Rooms\\" for local German citizens. What began as a collection of books and other material from American soldiers returning home grew into a number of extensive library collections. The US government began to support these initiatives in the late 1940s. The locations became officially known as \\"Amerika H√§user\\" and started receiving financial support through the US military and the newly created US Information Agency (USIA). The libraries grew into much larger establishments that included auditoriums, classrooms, and other exhibition spaces for film screenings, concerts, book readings, and panel discussions. German citizens, both young and old, were able to visit the institutions freely to learn more about American culture and politics and explore opportunities for academic, and other exchange programs with the US. The original goal of the \\"Amerika H√§user\\" were not to serve as platforms for propaganda, but to provide access to American culture, in particular through literature, and help to combat anti-American sentiment that had been encouraged by certain political elements since the early 1930s. During the Cold War the \\"Amerika H√§user\\" gained an increasingly important symbolic role, representing American freedom and democracy abroad. In addition to the cultural and political dialogue that took place within the buildings during this time they became locations for protests against American foreign policy (during the Vietnam War, for example) and for displays of solidarity (following September 11). The Amerika H√§user across Germany are illustrations of the special relationship between Germany and the United States and the importance of cultural diplomacy in international affairs. The Amerika Haus in Berlin The Amerika Haus Berlin has its origins in a passport office in the Berlin district of Sch√∂neberg that was established immediately after the end of the War. According to several accounts, one day in late 1945 a group of American military personnel returning home visited the office to donate some books, which were then displayed in the waiting room. Given that much reading material, particularly from American authors, had been destroyed either by the National Socialist regime or during the war itself, the books quickly became popular with German visitors. Military and civilian personnel responded to this demand by bringing further books to the office. The collection of reading material had developed to such an extent that, when the passport office closed, it was decided two employees would remain behind to run a small library. The library was officially opened on February 26, 1946, with a collection of around 2,000 books. Over the next four years the library developed in both size and scope and in the summer of 1947 displayed photos of American cities and landscapes, and information about American schools and colleges. In November of that year the first lecture took place at the Amerika Haus with a Professor Wells presenting to the public on the American elections. This was followed, one month later, by an exhibition of books written for young people by authors from across the world. Other developments that took place during this time included the playing of jazz music, which has previously been a taboo genre, in the library. During this time the library became officially known as the U.S. Information Center, and then the Amerika Haus. The first director of the Amerika Haus was Christopher Legge, who had started working there in November 1946. The Amerika Haus before the construction of the Berlin Wall The newly named Amerika Haus was given a significant boost in 1948 by the \\"US Information and Educational Exchange Act\\", popularly known as the Smith-Mundt Act. Signed into Law by President Harry Truman on January 27, the act demonstrated a commitment the dissemination of information about America's politics and culture abroad. The activities of the Amerika Haus Berlin intensified further as a result. On June 3, 1949, the institution moved into a new and more prominent location in Sch√∂neberg, near to Nollendorfplatz. In addition to the main library, the new building contained a library for children's books, an art studio, a periodicals division, a theatre room, and space for teaching workshops. The theatre room offered up to five screenings of news and short films each day. Other events that were held at the new location included English language classes, a jazz club, academic lectures, music concerts, and discussion groups. A further important development that took place at this time was the establishment of additional, external reading rooms which were opened across the city as offshoots of the Amerika Haus. To increase the availability of literature the institution also organized \\"bookmobiles\\" that brought books to the more remote parts of the city, including refugee camps. During these years the Amerika Haus Berlin was particularly popular with the citizens of East Berlin, which was under Soviet occupation and, from 1949 onwards, a socialist state represented by the Communist Party of Germany. During the blockade of West Berlin by the Soviet Union (June 1948 ‚Äì May 1949) the institution and its reading rooms became increasingly valuable as a source of Western newspapers and magazines, and the film screenings attracted up to 10,000 visitors from the East every month. The building's role as a distribution centre for literature associated with capitalism gave it an increasing importance that remained over the coming decades and led to frequent political discussions on the symbolism of the institution, which was financed exclusively by the American government. The growing popularity of the Amerika Haus during these years is demonstrated by visitor numbers. In 1946, the year it began as a library on Kleiststra√üe, the institution attracted around 6,000 visitors. This number grew to 68,000 in 1947, 207,000 in 1948, and 609,000 in 1949. By 1954 the institution was attracting almost 2 million annual visitors, with up to 2,000 book loans taking place each day. In 1957 the institution moved from its location close to Nollendorfplatz to a new purpose-built location on Hardenburgstra√üe, its current site near the Zoo station and the Kurf√ºrstendamm. The new structure was completed with two stories, and had a modernistic look. there was a small yard around its front and space on either side, which made it stand out in the heavily built up commercial area surrounding it. On the front side of the structure were huge block letters, spelling out Amerika Haus, in sky blue. The official opening ceremony met with great acclaim, especially since the new building was better equipped to serve the various functions required of the institution. The library contained around 50,000 English and German books, 150 periodicals, a photo archive with 12,000 photos depicting aspects of American life, and a music section with a sheet music archive and listening stations for record collections. The lecture program consisted of around 50 to 75 lectures per year. In addition to prestigious scientists, many other famous personalities visited the building, including politicians Ernst Lemme and Willy Brandt, journalists Thilo Koch and Peter von Zahn, composers Darius Milhaud and Alexander Tcherepnin, the actor Sidney Poitier, and the writer Thornton Wilder. The television evenings and feature film screenings were also further developed in the new building. More film screenings, workshops, theatre and dance performances, and music concerts were planned for the visitors from the East. In the vestibule and the upper floor there was space set aside for art and information exhibitions. Works from Lyonel Feininger (1962), Frank Lloyd Wright (1964), Robert Rauschenberg (1965), and a group of Native American artists (1964 and 1966) were displayed in addition to the exhibitions on the history and tradition of the US Army (1964) and the lunar photos taken by one of the space probes (1965). The Amerika Haus Berlin following the construction of the Berlin Wall Following the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 the Amerika Haus Berlin became the most prominent symbol of America in Berlin. Due to the changing political situation, however, limitations were placed on the scope of its activities. From August 13, 1961, the day on which construction of the Berlin Wall began, East Berliners could no longer travel freely to West Berlin and were required to return the books they had borrowed by post. The reading rooms that had emerged across the city, which had previously been full of East Berliners, now stood almost empty and were eventually completely abandoned. On November 5, 1961, the Amerika Haus Berlin reacted to the construction of the Berlin Wall with the opening of a permanent exhibit on the Wall and the changing political conditions. This exhibition remained in place until 1974 and informed Berliners and other visitors to Berlin about the construction, progression, and implications of the border. Many prominent guests to the city made stops to this exhibition, including actor James Stewart (July 2, 1962), author John Steinbeck (December 13, 1963), and politicians Robert F. Kennedy (Spring 1962), Heinrich L√ºbke (February 3, 1963), and Richard Nixon (July 23, 1963). The emergence of student activism during the 1960s led to the Amerika Haus becoming a prominent site for protests against American foreign policy. As the most obvious representation of America in Berlin, the building was the natural target for protestors. The most controversial topic during this time was America's involvement in the Vietnam War. A number of citizens claimed that the material available in the building did not accurately reflect the situation in Vietnam and that the institution was simply a centre for American propaganda. Late one night in October 1965 a group of individuals broke into the Amerika Haus Berlin and distributed pro-communist literature in the library. Pro-communist protestors also interrupted a podium discussion in the Amerika Haus entitled \\"Focal Point Vietnam\\", although this did not prevent the institution from holding further events on Vietnam, such as a lecture entitled \\"Development Aid for Vietnam\\" that took place in February 1966. Such displays of protest became more violent as the 1960s progressed. In February 1966 a group of around 500-1000 students gathered in front of the building for a protest against the Vietnam War. Although sanctioned by the police, they were forced to step in when students began throwing eggs at the building and the American flag. Whilst relatively tame when compared with later actions, this incident provoked a strong pro-American reaction from certain parts of the city. The newspaper Die Welt described the incident as \\"embarrassing\\", and the head of Free University of Berlin offered his support. The Student Council at Technical University of Berlin also sympathized with the United States and called for the creation of a scholarship that would be granted to a member of the American Peace Corps. In reaction to this outpouring of support in favor of the institution, the police launched a search for the people responsible for throwing the eggs. Two days after the demonstration the CDU, the Young Union, and the Circle of Christian-Democratic Students organized a counter- demonstration that took place in front of the Amerika Haus. Some hecklers were removed during the course of this half-hour gathering and were forcibly taken to the nearby train station Zoologischer Garten, where they were told they could get a ticket and go to the East if they were so strongly against American politics. A few weeks later the Amerika Haus Berlin celebrated its 20th anniversary with a special ceremony, during which the incidents of the previous weeks were further discussed. The support the Berliners gave in response to the egg throwing incident clearly showed that the majority of Berliners thought positively of the institution. Even Mayor Willy Brandt, a staunch supporter of freedom of speech, spoke out against the actions of the students and offered his support. Despite this outpouring of support, further demonstrations against American policy towards Vietnam took place. On December 20, 1967, the newly elected Mayor Klaus Sch√ºtz spoke out against the demonstrations during a lecture at the Free University. Some students who were present at the speech were angered by Mr. Sch√ºtz's words and his pro-Vietnam stance. Many of them left the event, walked to the Greek military mission and then on to the Amerika Haus where they broke windows by throwing stones and snowballs. The police were called in to stop the demonstration and save the building from further destruction. The fragmentation of the student movement in the late 1960s led to a new phase in protests against the Amerika Haus that included further demonstrations carried out by militant and anarchist groups. On December 12, 1969, a guard in the front room of the library found a suspicious package and decided to dispose of it by throwing it out of the window. The package was later found at the nearby Zoologischer Garten station, where it was found to contain a delayed-action bomb that had malfunctioned. The news of the invasion of Cambodia by American troops in May 1970 led to further attacks on the building. A group of about 20 people drove to the building on May 5 and smashed windows with stones, even throwing Molotov cocktails in the building. Although the guards were not allowed to use their weapons against the protestors, they were able to put out the fire. The most violent conflict happened a few days later in reaction to the continuing war in Cambodia and the Kent State Shootings in Ohio that had left four students dead. Around 8000 protestors and 5000 policemen occupied the space in front of the building, which had been reinforced with barbed wire and other barriers due to heightened security concerns. Some of the more militant protestors tried to charge through the barriers with bottles, stones, and other weapons. The police held back the protestors with water hoses. During the incident a civil servant took out his gun and fired three shots, injuring an innocent bystander and a colleague. In total, 44 people were arrested and 231 policemen and an unknown number of demonstrators were injured. After the turbulent and controversial events of the 1960s the role and activity of the Amerika Haus changed over the subsequent two decades. The fading of the hippie movement during the 1970s and the withdrawal of American troops from Vietnam from 1973-1975 ensured that no further large-scale protests took place. The building shifted its focus to the portrayal and reflection of American popular culture, as symbolized by the Hollywood film industry and pop music, which was increasingly popular worldwide. The Amerika Haus following the fall of the Berlin Wall The Amerika Haus was an operation of the USIA for most of its history. Up until the fall of the Berlin Wall The Amerika Haus in Berlin was to a certain degree under the umbrella of the U.S. Mission in Berlin. Amerika Haus began reporting through the newly created American Embassy Office Berlin (a satellite of the Embassy in Bonn), and its Principal Officer when this new entity came into being in the early 1990s. In 1999 the USIA was merged into the State Department and as a result the Amerika Haus became an arm of the Public Diplomacy cadre of the U.S. State Department and put more firmly under the authority of the Principal Officer in Berlin. Later, in 1998, when the Embassy Office became the full-fledged Embassy newly relocated to Berlin, the Amerika Haus was more directly under the authority of the Ambassador, now resident in Berlin. Following the peaceful revolution and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 many commentators questioned the role the institution could play in a united Germany and a post-Cold War Europe. The geo-political shift that took place in 1989, however, generated a high demand for further information on US politics and culture. The Amerika Haus became a meeting place for politicians, economists, scientists, and businessmen from across Europe. Another factor in the eventual demise of the Amerika Haus were the stricter security standards of the U.S Department's Diplomatic Security Service, as opposed to the standards of the former parent agency USIA. The location, layout and design of the Amerika Haus did not lend itself to these new standards. The identity of the Amerika Haus as a symbol of the United States for Berliners was reaffirmed following the terrorist attacks that took place on September 11, 2001. Although they viewed events from a distance, many Berliners felt compelled to display their sympathy for the American citizens. In a public outpouring of emotion, thousands of citizens laid flowers in front of the building in a show of solidarity, a stark contrast to the events of the 1960s. On September 25, 2006, almost 60 years after the institution had been established, the Amerika Haus Berlin was closed and the building returned to the city of Berlin by the US Ambassador William R. Timkin Jr. Following this closure, a number of organizations and individuals in civil society campaigned to revive the building. In September 2008, the doors of the Amerika Haus were reopened for an event series \\"How will America Vote?\\" and in January 2009 \\"Black History Month in Berlin 2009\\". In 2014 the charitable foundation C/O Berlin relocated from the Postfuhramt in Mitte to the Amerika Haus and hosts photography exhibitions there. In 2015, C/O Berlin was awarded the Berlin BDA Prize (Bund Deutscher Architekten) for its sensitive refurbishment and revitalization of the building.http://www.co-berlin.org/en/co-berlin- foundation References Category:Amerika H√§user Category:Non-profit organisations based in Berlin Category:Germany‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:Cold War history of Germany ","title":"Amerika Haus Berlin"},{"id":"33664183","text":"Morten Schuldt-Jensen is a Danish classical conductor.

A weak system for much of its duration, Keila developed in the western Arabian Sea in late October 2011, amid an area of marginally favorable conditions. On November 2, it briefly organized enough to be classified as a cyclonic storm, which has maximum sustained winds of at least 65 km/h (40 mph). Given the name Keila by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the storm quickly moved ashore southern Oman near Salalah, and weakened while meandering over the country. The remnants soon after moved offshore, dissipating on November 4\\\\. The storm brought heavy rainfall to Oman, reaching just over in the mountains near Salalah. Moisture from the storm spread across most of the country, causing flash flooding near the capital Muscat. Floods from the storm killed 14 people, injured over 200, washed away hundreds of cars, and damaged many buildings. Two hospitals were damaged, forcing 60 patients to be evacuated elsewhere by helicopter. Overall damage was estimated at US$80 million (2011 USD). Offshore, Keila capsized a boat originating from India, killing five of the crew and leaving another nine missing; six sailors were rescued by the Omani Coast Guard. Meteorological history The Intertropical Convergence Zone produced an area of convection in the southeastern Arabian Sea toward the end of October 2011. The overall system moved west-northwestward, developing a distinct low pressure area on October 27. By that time, the thunderstorm activity was still disorganized and associated with a weak circulation. Environmental conditions were unfavorable initially, consisting of strong wind shear and dry air. An anticyclone over the system caused the shear to decrease by October 28, amid warm water temperatures of , both more favorable conditions. By that time the circulation became well-defined, although still elongated, and the convection was still scattered. On October 29, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) designated the system as Depression ARB 02 about 885 km (550 mi) east of the Yemeni island of Socotra. Convection continued to organize and deepen as the nascent depression continued west- northwestward, steered by a ridge to the north. However, dry air from the Arabian Peninsula and cooler waters proved deleterious to the system, and the circulation became more disorganized on October 30. Despite the marginally favorable conditions, the overall structure improved on November 1, with pronounced outflow developing along the western periphery. A nearby buoy reported a barometric pressure of , which confirmed the increasing organization. At 03:00 UTC on November 1, the IMD upgraded the depression to a deep depression, and 24 hours later to Cyclonic Storm Keila. By that time, the agency estimated peak 3 minute sustained winds of 65 km/h (40 mph) while the storm was just 150 km (95 mi) southeast of Oman. The American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also designated the system as Tropical Cyclone 03A at 03:00 UTC on November 2. With cool waters and an unfavorable phase of the Madden‚ÄìJulian oscillation, Keila failed to intensify significantly as it approached the southeastern Arabian Peninsula. An irregular central dense overcast developed over the circulation, consisting of shallow convection. A passing trough weakened the ridge to the north, steering Keila toward the north. After weakening to a deep depression again, Keila made landfall near Salalah, Oman around 18:00 UTC on November 2. Around that time, the JTWC discontinued advisories, once the storm was weakening rapidly over land. With a ridge to the north and east, Keila followed the track of the anticyclone aloft, which brought it back offshore Oman on November 3\\\\. Such looping near the coast was considered rare by the IMD. According to the agency, the system continued eastward and dissipated on November 4. However, the JTWC tracked the system further in a post-season analysis, estimating that Keila intensified once offshore and attained peak winds of 100 km/h (65 mph) on November 3\\\\. The agency assessed that the storm turned to the southwest and weakened, only to turn back to the northwest and dissipate over extreme eastern Yemen on November 5. Preparations and impact Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission estimate of precipitation from Keila over Oman There was confusion in the country over Keila's intensity; the IMD classified it as a cyclonic storm, while officials in Oman designated it as a deep depression, based on available observations. Officials warned residents of the potential for heavy rainfall. The Pakistani government also warned fishermen not to venture to the open seas, due to the uncertain effects of the storm. While Keila was offshore and still in its developmental stages, it brought winds of 41 km/h (25 mph) to Salalah International Airport, and at the time of landfall, the station reported slightly stronger winds of 43 km/h (26 mph). However, the storm's most severe effects were related to the heavy rainfall it produced over Oman, which peaked at just over in the mountains near Salalah. In southern Oman, Keila dropped of rainfall at Salalah, the equivalent of a year's worth of precipitation. Moisture from the storm coalesced over the Al Hajar Mountains in northern Oman, producing severe thunderstorms that led to flash flooding. Across southern Oman where the storm crossed, there were no deaths; all of the deaths occurred due to the flash floods in northern Oman, where 14 people lost their lives. Three people were killed due to electrocutions, another two were crushed to death by large objects, and nine drowned. Overall damage was estimated at US$80 million, and over 200 people were injured nationwide. The rains caused wadis - typically dry riverbeds - to accumulate with floodwaters, washing away hundreds of cars and disrupting traffic. Police officers helped rescue victims who were stranded in flooded wadis. Some drivers rode out the floods on the roofs of their cars. The deluge also damaged crops and farm buildings elsewhere in the country. Damage was heaviest near the capital city Muscat, where houses and businesses were damaged by the floods, and there were many traffic accidents. A school bus was swept away in Wadi Kabir, although the students were soon after rescued by local authorities. Several buildings collapsed in Sur due to the rains. In the valley near Al-Rustaq, floodwaters swept away cars, dead animals, and property, with water levels reaching high in some places. The floods damaged two hospitals in northern Oman; police helicopters transferred 60 patients after the facilities were closed for maintenance, and other patients were moved to other local hospitals. Just days after Keila dissipated, another deep depression threatened Oman and brought additional rainfall. Sailing from the Indian state of Gujarat to Dubai, a ship with the call sign MSV Shiv Sagar MNV 2169 encountered Keila offshore southern Oman. The storm's high winds caused the boat to capsize, killing five of the sailors, and leaving nine others missing. Six of the crew were rescued by the Omani Coast Guard.

Ridley was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm medium pace. He was born at Felsted, Essex. Ridley served during World War I, during which he was promoted from 2nd Lieutenant to Lieutenant on 28 May 1918. He later resigned his commission from the 2nd Dragoon Guards on 1 April 1920, retaining the rank of Lieutenant. Later in November of that year, he joined the Essex Yeomanry, which was part of the Territorial Force. In cricket, Ridley made his first-class debut for Essex against the Combined Services in 1922. He made five further first-class appearances for Essex, the last of which came against Somerset in the 1926 County Championship. In his six first- class appearances, he scored 113 runs at an average of 10.27, with a high score of 66 not out54. This score, which was his only first-class half century, came against Gloucestershire in 1924. In September 1930 he was awarded the Efficiency Decoration for over twelve years service in the Essex Yeomanry (his service had earlier been placed back to 28 May 1918). By 1938 he held the rank of Captain and had been awarded the Territorial Decoration, it was in this year that he resigned his commission.

Discovery Cuspicephalus is known from the holotype MJML K1918, a partial skull which is missing the mandible and dentition, preserved on a single slab. It was collected in December 2009 by Steve Etches from Kimmeridge Bay on the Isle of Purbeck coast of Dorset. This locality is referred to the Autissiodorensis ammonite biozone of the lower part of the Kimmeridge Clay Formation, dating to the early Kimmeridgian stage of the Late Jurassic, about 155.7-153 million years ago. =Naming and etymology= Cuspicephalus was named by David M. Martill and Steve Etches in 2013 and the type species is Cuspicephalus scarfi. The generic name is derived from cuspis, Latin for \\"point\\", after its pointed rostrum, and a Latinised Greek Œ∫ŒµœÜŒ±ŒªŒÆ, kephal√®, for \\"head\\". The specific name honors artist and cartoonist Gerald Scarfe for his vicious caricatures which mostly have very pointy noses. Description Skull and restoration The skull is lightly built and has a length of 326 millimetres. It is very elongated, being just 55 millimetres high at the back, and has an triangular profile. Almost half of its length is accounted for by a large skull opening, the fenestra nasoantorbitalis, a confluence of the original fenestra antorbitalis with the bony nostrils. In front of this opening a low and elongated snout is present. The rostral index sensu Naish & Martill of this snout, in this case its length divided by its maximum height, is 5.4, the highest value known for any pterosaur. In the snout about eleven or twelve teeth are present; the total for the upper jaw is estimated at twenty-five to thirty. The teeth are largest in front and gradually decline in size towards the back. They have a broad base with an oval cross-section. Perhaps they are pointing outwards to a degree but the deformation of the fossil by compression makes this uncertain. On top of the skull, behind the snout proper, above the fenestra a longitudinal low bony crest is present. It consists of fibrous bone, vertically directed, which might have formed the base for a much higher crest of soft tissue. The crest starts above the twelfth tooth position; its limit at the back is unknown because of damage but it is considered unlikely that it extended as far as the eyes, the roof of the skull not showing any trace of it. The crest is highest in the (preserved) middle. Phylogeny The describers did not perform a cladistic analysis to determine the exact place of Cuspicephalus in pterosaur phylogeny. Using the comparative method, they noticed a resemblance to Germanodactylus. Until recently pterosaurs with a head shape like that of Cuspicephalus would as a matter of course been assigned to the Pterodactyloidea. Today it is known however that more basal groups had comparable heads, so the describers placed Cuspicephalus as a member of the more general Monofenestrata. A more thorough analysis published in 2015 found that Cuspicephalus was likely a primitive monofenestratan pterosaur, and, specifically, a member of the group Wukongopteridae.

The lake is Spread over an area of approximately in the middle of a forest area, also known as Sanjay Lake Park. Sanjay Lake was developed in the 1970s by DDA and opened in 1982. The lake attracts some migratory birds and has many indigenous trees. A well-laid-out fitness track is very popular with walking-enthusiasts. Geography Ducks in Sanjay Lake Park, Delhi, India The lake bound by Sanjay lake park, is surrounded by the residential colonies of Kalyanpuri and Trilokpuri on the eastern side and Mayur Vihar on the Western side. Sanjay Jheel is a huge rainwater fed lake. At times, the water supply was augmented by the back flowing Yamuna. During floods, it also received water through Hindon River channel. Different types of birds can be seen here till February end every year. According to Local birders, the lake hosts 90 varieties of birds. Shovellers, Pintails, common pochard, tufted pochard, common teal, Indian spot-billed duck, yellow headed wagtail and pied wagtail are some of the birds that commonly visit the lake. The migratory birds mostly come to the eastern part of the lake, as the water is deeper and the area is free from human disturbances. History Long before the trans yamuna (now known as East Delhi) area, thus called because it lay across the Yamuna River from the main city of New Delhi, was colonised by the government, this was natural low-lying area, land depression where rainwater collected, which was also fed by excess run-off from a cut in the Hindon River. The area had a number of villages like Patparganj in the floodplains of Yamuna and vast agricultural lands. Eventually, in 1970 this was developed by Delhi Development Authority into a long winding lake. Initially the lake spread over 89 acres and together with the surrounding park it covered an area of 178 acres. However it was greatly shrunk after DDA started developing the area for its housing colonies, as colonies like Mayur Vihar, Indraprastha Extension (I.P. Extn.), and Patparganj DDA colonies started coming up in the 1980s and its catchment area was largely built over. Similarly, when National Highway 24 (NH 24) was built to connect the national capital to Capital of Uttar Pradesh state, Lucknow, which cut through the lake, and the Nizamuddin bridge was built over the Yamuna and its northern portion was lost and lake was reduced to present . In the following decades, as land pressure increased in East Delhi, the lake further shrunk due to unauthorised construction, encroachment and sewage from near by slums. In 2009, the DDA handed over the park area and the lake to the Delhi Tourism Department. Overview Entry gate to Sanjay Lake Park Sanjay Lake is the tourist location of Delhi. This is a lake along with a long park. Sanjay Lake has a total forested area of 170 acres, and it is one of the longest park of East Delhi locations. Sanjay Lake is an artificial lake which is dependent on sewer and rainwater. Playground in sanjay lake There is also a Sanjay Jheel, within the Sanjay Van (Sanjay Forest) part of the South Delhi ridge, adjacent to Mehrauli and Vasant Kunj, Delhi. Adventure Park The Adventure Park was inaugurated on 16 December 2015 by then Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi Manish Sisodia. The park has been set up by Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation (DTTDC) in association with Delhi Development Authority (DDA) under PPP mode. The Adventure Park is claimed to have been developed on a Wild West theme making extensive use of natural materials such as wood and jute rope and consisting of hut like structures. Spread across 6.3 acres, it has nine lawns-Great Plain, Battle Ground, Home Dome, The Den, Grazing Field, Bad Lands, Cattle Ranch, Cowboy Creek and a man-made beach. Apart from that, Delhi Development Authority (DDA) has also suggested twin corporate towers, a park, old-age homes and studio apartments for its ambitious ‚ÄòLake City project‚Äô at Sanjay Lake.

Rayz was born in the town of Narayiv, in eastern Galicia, then Austro-Hungary. He died in 1943, in Woodstock, New York. Biography In 1898, at the age of 13, Rayz immigrated to New York and adopted the Americanized name Isaac Reiss. Within a few years his work was published widely in the New York Yiddish press, under a variety of pseudonyms, including Rinnalde Rinaldine, Dilensee Mirkarosh, Der Royzenkavalir, Doctor Hotzikl, and, finally, Moishe Nadir. The name \\"Nadir\\" is a Yiddish expression meaning \\"here you are\\" or \\"that's for you,\\" but can also mean \\"take this and choke on it.\\" As a teenager, he wrote for Der Groyser Kundes (The Big Prankster) and later co-edited Der Yiddisher Gazlon (The Yiddish Bandit) with Jacob Adler. He wrote for an assortment of Communist Yiddish publications including the Frayhayt (Freedom) newspaper and its successor Morgn Frayhayt (Morning Freedom) and the magazines Der Signal (The Signal) and Der Hammer (The Hammer). When his sharp-tongued theater reviews caused him to be banned from theatrical productions, he resorted to attending plays in disguise. His own plays were performed by Maurice Schwartz‚Äôs Yiddish Art Theater, Zuni Maude and Yosl Cutler's Modicut puppet theater, Artef (Arbeter Teater Faraband, Workers Theater Alliance) and the Federal Theater Project. Among his better known poems are the erotic Vilde Royzen (Wild Roses, 1915) and his 1932 Rivington Strit (Rivington Street). After a long association with the Freiheit and the Morgen Freiheit, Rayz began to distance himself from the Communist cause with the onset of the show trials in the Soviet Union and publicly broke with the Morgn Frayhayt in the wake of the Molotiv-Ribbentrop Pact. He set out his reasons in ‚ÄúDi, vos blayben mit der Morgn Frayhayt‚Äù (‚ÄúThose who stay with the Morgn Frayhayt‚Äù) in response to Morgn Frayhayt editor Moissaye Olgin‚Äôs ‚ÄúDi vos gayen avek‚Äù (‚ÄúThose who leave‚Äù).

The dolmen sits at the southern end of a large cairn, of approximately 30x10 metres, the north end of which also contains a cist.

Early life and family  David Larible comes from six generations of circus artists, and his family has ties with many other European circus families. His great-grandfather was Pierre Larible, an acrobat and dancer; his grandfather was also a clown. Larible's father, Eugenio Larible (1931-2017), was a trapeze artist and juggler who taught at a circus school in Verona. Larible's mother, Lucina Casartelli (1931-2003), was a child circus artist, as was Lucina's father. David Larible has three sisters: Eliana Paul, married to Bernhard Paul; Cinzia Larible-Gerard; and the trapeze artist Vivien, married to No√® Espa√±a. Born in 1957 in Verona, Italy, Larible grew up performing in various circuses. His father Eugenio appeared as a juggler and performed together with his uncle Renzo on the trapeze.  Career  Larible with Circus Roncalli (Vienna, 2009) As a child, David Larible was taught acrobatics and juggling by his father Eugenio. In 1968, he began an apprenticeship with the Conservatory of Music in Verona. His first official appearance in the ring was in 1973 at the Circus Medrano. There, he performed with his family in a roller-skating number. In the 1970s, followed by engagements in Switzerland, he joined the French circus Circus Nock in Bouglione. In the early 1980s, Larible's parents were involved in Circus Krone; he begged the then-director of Circus Frieda Sembach-Krone to let him step in as a clown. He exploited this opportunity and built the relatively small number still further. Other engagements followed. After a three-year guest appearance at the Italian Circus Togni, Larible returned to Munich to rejoin the Circus Krone, where he remained until 1989. During this period, he was a producer of ZDF's television series Circus - Animals, Clowns and Acrobats. He performed as part of the Circus of the Stars. In the 1980s, he began to incorporate involvement by the audience into his act. Today this remains one of his trademarks. In 1989, Larible left Germany and started performing in England and Mexico. In 1991, he joined the biggest and most famous circus in the United States - Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. From 1993 to 2005, he was under contract and quickly became the main attraction. His time in the United States was characterized by hard work and achievement. Larible says, \\"I would not miss a day, even if I was sick, I went on.\\" During those years, he developed other trademarks, inventing new numbers and perfecting his performance. He went on to appear in Barnum's Kaleidoscape, a new concept for the United States circus. David and his sister Vivien appeared in Disney's sing-along songs \\"Lets Go to the Circus\\". David also appeared on Sesame Street with his daughter Shirley in a film segment about what it's like to be in the circus. Larible had a brief appearance in the film Ocean's Eleven in 2001. In 2005, Larible returned to Europe. Since 2006 he has been involved with the German Circus Roncalli. In 2014, he performed with the Swiss Circus Knie. In 2018 he resumed international tours with his performance in prestigious theatres such as the Gran Teatro Nacional in Lima and the Colsubsidio in Bogota. He was Special guest in the program \\"Moscow - Monte Carlo\\" in the Nikulin Circus (the oldest in Moscow) as well as main attraction at the Circus Ciniselli in St. Petersburg in two different productions In the same year take part in the International Clown Festival where he receives the Grand Prix for Lifetime Achievement. In 2019 he directs and interprets the show \\"Gran Circo de Europa\\" in Peru and was invited by the greatest Russian Theatre Actor Sergey Bezrukov to participate at the Theatre Festival \\"Grandkidsfest\\" with the show \\"The Clown Of Clowns\\", for a great success.  Techniques and influences  Larible with Circus Roncalli (Vienna, 2009) David Larible is known for his classic auguste clown technique. Larible has a wide repertoire as a dancer, singer, musician and juggler. He is inspired by classical music, opera and ballet. One of his specialities is direct interaction with the audience and involvement by spectators. His influences include Charlie Chaplin, Charlie Rivel and Grock. In his gestures and facial expressions, he reminds the audience of Chaplin, but he has developed his own style and presence in the ring. He often uses music composed by Chaplin in his performances.

During the transitional period, Meles Zenawi served as the president of the TGE while Tamrat Layne was prime minister.Young, John (1996). \\"The Tigray and Eritrean Peoples Liberation Fronts: A History of Tensions and Pragmatism.\\" Journal of Modern African Studies. 34 (1): 114. Among other major shifts in the country's political institutions, it was under the authority of the TGE that the realignment of provincial boundaries on the basis of ethnolinguistic identity occurred. The TGE was in power until 1995, when it transitioned into the reconstituted Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia that remains today.  Background  In May 1991, the PDRE (1987-1991) was overthrown by forces consisting of the TPLF and the TPLF-controlled EPRDF with the promise that a recognition of human rights, democracy, the liberalization of the economic sector, and political rehabilitation were soon to follow. The PDRE, the country's newest civilian regime, was actually dominated by leaders of the preceding Derg (1974-1987) a military junta led by Mengistu Haile Mariam that seized power by overthrowing the long-ruling Emperor Haile Selassie I in 1974. The Derg (meaning \\"committee\\" or \\"council\\") and its leaders were known for dramatically restructuring the country's political and economic institutions, often through the use of suppression and fear, while transforming the central government's role in domestic affairs. Programs such as the extensive villagization schemes carried out in various parts of the country further served as a testament to the regime's commitment to radical reform measures. Once in power, the leaders of the PDRE continued pursuing their aims as former Derg leaders, such as by resuming forced resettlement programs that were deemed nonviable by many and were ultimately met with a considerable amount of international criticism. Scholars have noted that the fall of the PDRE was largely made possible by the loss of both financial and military support from the dwindling Soviet Union, which had previously backed the Derg following their seizure of power in 1974. The EPRDF capitalized on the mismanaged PDRE's weakening state and general unpopularity when rebel forces officially seized power from the PRDE in May 1991. Soon after the EPRDF secured the nation's capital, a \\"National Conference on Peace and Reconciliation\\" was called in Addis Ababa. Held in July 1991, the conference was intended to outline a transitional framework for the period following the newest regime change. Some notable ethnicity-based political movements that were present include the Oromo Liberation Front, the Afar Liberation Front, and the Western Somali Liberation Front. Any political organizations that wanted to attend was required to be centered around ethnic identity; thus, several organizations were quickly created for that purpose, resulting in the rapid development of urban elite-led ethnicity-based movements.Vaughan, Sarah 1994. The Addis Ababa Transitional Conference of July 1991: its origin, history and significance. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Centre for African Studies. Any person or political organization that had been associated with Mengistu Haile Mariam's Workers' Party of Ethiopia was also not permitted to attend.  Transitional charter  The 1991 conference ultimately resulted in the adoption of the \\"Transitional Period Charter of Ethiopia\\" and the official establishment of a transitional government. Much to the relief of the international community, the conference attendees agreed on major transformations of the country's political and economic systems that would usher in liberal institutions that were purportedly intended to guarantee fair representation, encourage plurality, and demand transparency at the executive level.Vaughan, Sarah 1994. The Addis Ababa Transitional Conference of July 1991: its origin, history and significance. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Centre for African Studies. This and other key initiatives of the TGE were outlined in the Transitional Period Charter of Ethiopia, which was divided into five parts: = Part I: democratic Rights = Explicitly drawing from the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article One of the Charter declares that every individual is entitled to the following: > \\"a. The freedom of conscience, expression, association, and peaceable > assembly; b. The right to engage in unrestricted political activity and to > organize political parties, provided the exercise of such right does not > infringe upon the rights of others.\\" Article Two concerns the rights of \\"nations, nationalities, and peoples\\" in Ethiopia, referring to the various ethnolinguistic groups in the country. Not only does the Charter protect nationalities' right to exercise their autonomy, but it also allows them to secede (\\"self-determination of independence\\") if they so wish. = Part II: Principles guiding foreign policy = This section briefly affirms the TGE's authority to \\"abide by all mutual agreements that respect the sovereignty of Ethiopia and are not contrary to the interests of the People.\\" In addition, it grants subnational governments the right to form their own relationships with foreign organizations if it is for the purpose of humanitarian or relief efforts. = Part III: Structure and Composition of the Transitional Government = This section outlines the structure of the Transitional Government, starting with the establishment of a Council of Representatives, which \\"shall be composed of representatives of national liberation movements, other political organizations and prominent individuals, to make-up a total of no more than 87 members.\\" The Council of Representatives was also responsible for supporting the work of the unelected Council of Ministers, which primarily consisted of members selected by the heads of state (president, prime minister, etc.). = Part IV: Transitional programme = Part IV provides a general outline of the remaining actions to be taken during the transitional period. It assigns the Council of Representatives with the responsibility to oversee the creation of a draft constitution that would eventually be presented to the Constituent Assembly before being formally adopted. Article twelve briefly mandates that elections for a National Assembly, must be held within the following two years; the Transitional Government was expected to hand over power to the parties who make up a majority of the Assembly. The second section of Part IV expresses the Transitional Government's commitment to relief efforts supporting those whose lives had been severely impacted by armed conflict, violence on behalf of the previous regime, and to \\"the rehabilitation of those forceably [sic] uprooted by the previous regime's policy of villagisation and resettlement.\\" Article Seventeen makes an additional reference to the state of inter-ethnic relations in the country\\" > \\"[The Transitional Government] shall make special efforts to dispel ethnic > mistrust and eradicate the ethnic hatred that have been fostered by the > previous regimes.\\" = Part V: Legality of the charter = Part V proclaims the Charter's authority as \\"the supreme law of the land for the duration of the transitional period,\\" effective 22 July 1991.  Leadership  The Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) was a coalition of various ethnically- based political movement created by the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), a guerrilla movement formed in the contemporary Tigray region of northern Ethiopia in 1975. The TPLF was at the core of the EPRDF, although other political movements in the coalition included the Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement (which later became the Amhara National Democratic Movement, representing those from what is now known as the Amhara region of the country) and the Oromo People's Democratic Organisation (OPDO), representing those from the Oromia region of Ethiopia. 1992 marked the first elections of the transitional period, which were held to select representatives for 14 new regional assemblies. The main political movements competing for power were the EPRDF, the All Amhara People's Organisation, and the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF). During the campaign cycle, various opposition movements (including the OLF) publicly withdrew from the races, complaining that the threats and intimidation tactics allegedly used by the EPRDF would make it impossible for the elections to be free and fair. Meles Zenawi in 2012 The potential for the EPRDF to assume total power in the Transitional Government was suspected by many from the beginning. At the 1991 National Conference on Peace and Reconciliation, one foreign onlooker commented that \\"[although the 1991 conference may not have resulted in a one party government[,] its convention reflects to a large degree a one party dynamic.\\" The terms of the resulting charter were likewise mainly drawn from the key ideals of the EPRDF (particularly those of the TPLF).Leencho Lata 1999. The Ethiopian State at the Crossroads. Lawrenceville: The Red Sea Press In addition, the president of the TGE was Meles Zenawi, chairman of the TPLF; his colleague, fellow EPRDF leader Tamrat Layne, became the prime minister. Thirty-two of the eighty-seven seats in the Council of Representatives were filled by EPRDF members as well. The TGE also took steps to cleanse the government of any traces of the previous regime, such as removing and replacing the occupants of almost all senior government posts, reorganizing all state agencies and institutions, and disbanding the Derg's large military force.  Ethnic federalism  One of the most dramatic political changes overseen by the Transitional Government was the realignment of provincial boundaries on the basis of ethnolinguistic identity. This marked the beginning of Ethiopia's first federal administrative structure, made up of the 9 regional states (singular: ·ä≠·àç·àç kilil; plural: kililoch) that the country is identified by today. Article Two of the Transitional Period Charter of Ethiopia formally proclaims the rights of ethnic groups within the country, which are officially referred to as nations or nationalities: > \\"The right of nations, nationalities and peoples to self-determination is > affirmed. to this end, each nation, nationality and people is guaranteed the > right to: a./ Preserve its identity and have it respected, promote its > culture and history and use and develop its language; b./ Administer its own > affairs within its own defined territory and effectively participate in the > central government on the basis of freedom, and fair and proper > representation; c./ Exercise its right to self determination of > independence, when the concerned, nation/nationality and people is convinced > that the above rights are denied, abridged or abrogated.\\" As such, one of the TGE's main aims was to establish a devolution of political power down to ethnic divisions, arguing that it was an essential move if the country wanted to lessen conflicts across ethnic lines, ensure a fairer distribution of resources across the country, and increase efficiency within the public sector. By 1994, the ethnically-based regions of Afar, Tigray, Somali, Amhara, Benishangul-Gumuz, Oromia, Harari, Gambela, and the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region (SNNPR), a diverse region inhabited by at least 40 different ethnic groups, were formally established. Addis Ababa, defined as a federal district, and later Dire Dawa were declared to be ethnically diverse chartered cities. Contemporary political boundaries of Ethiopia It is commonly suggested by scholars that the EPRDF's decision to establish a federal administrative structure along ethnic lines was a move towards reinforcing its political dominance.Vaughan, Sarah 1994. The Addis Ababa Transitional Conference of July 1991: its origin, history and significance. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Centre for African Studies.Hassen, Mohammed. 1999. 'Ethiopia: Missed opportunities for peaceful democratic process' in Kidane Mengisteab and Daddieh, Cyril (ed.) State building and democratization in Africa. Westport: Praeger. By dividing the country and facilitating the creation of accompanying ethnically-based parties under the government's control, the TPLF (which represented less than 10% of the country's population) could intensify its hold on power. Dissatisfied opposition parties argued that this form of federalization was not appropriate for the country. For instance, the All Amhara People's Organisation (AAPO) and the Ethiopian Democratic Union Party expressed in 2000 that they preferred a strong unitary state with representation of the country's nationalities at the core. Other groups, such as the Oromo National Congress (ONC) and the Ethiopia Democratic Party (EDP), were not opposed to the idea of establishing a federal system, arguing that it set the foundation for regional autonomy, but believed that it was a mistake for it to conducted along ethnic lines.  Human rights abuses  Throughout the transitional period, the Transitional Government of Ethiopia has been criticized by various human rights organizations for abuses ranging from extrajudicial executions to unlawful detentions. At the establishment of the TGE in 1991, when the EPRDF first took power, human rights organizations such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International expressed optimism about the future of the state of human rights in Ethiopia. During the previous regime under Mengistu, human rights groups could not exist; following May 1991, however, human rights watchdogs such as the Ethiopian Human Rights Council, the Ethiopian Congress for Democrats, and the human rights committee of the Committee of Eleven were established. However, hopes were quickly dashed following a pattern of rights violations aimed at political dissidents across the country. For instance, at least ten demonstrators in Addis Ababa were killed while protesting the EPRDF in their early days of power. In addition, an estimated 5,000-100,000+ members (including jailed former soldiers) of the previous PDRE were swiftly imprisoned under the TGE. While some were later released, many others were held without being officially charged or having a trial. Members of Mengistu's Workers' Party of Ethiopia were also not permitted to travel abroad or go back to work if they were previously detained by the EPRDF for the duration of the year, but generally found themselves able to do so in 1992. From May 1991 to the end of the year, the EPRDF is suspected to have committed dozens of summary executions despite the government's lack of information surrounding state-sanctioned executions. The 1992 elections for 14 new regional assemblies were widely criticized by international observers who asserted that instances of fraud and the arrests of opposition leaders rendered the elections' results, which overwhelmingly favored the EPRDF, meaningless. For instance, in many cases, candidates representing the All-Amhara People's Organization were prevented from registering themselves in various constituencies. Similarly, candidates representing the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) were threatened, harassed, and detained by the EPRDF. Despite a law that lifted nearly all of the censorship restrictions enacted by the PDRE, much of the media was still controlled by the government and many journalists were still reluctant to risk challenging the TGE or raising awareness of the regime's abuses. Later, the TGE created a Special Prosecutor's Office to begin investigating government personnel associated with the previous regime or Mengistu's Worker's Party of Ethiopia, deciding to formally suspend habeas corpus from August 1992 to the end of the year. By the end of the year, however, none of the detainees had been charged with any crimes. Nearly 20,000 suspected armed OLF members, some of which were believed to be unarmed civilians (including children) were forcibly held in military camps in three different regions for the purpose of disarming and \\"re-educat[ing]\\" them, although very few had been released by the end of 1992. Throughout this time, the country's judiciary had failed to adequately adjudicate cases or to hold the TGE and its forces accountable for rights abuses. This was largely due to disruptions such as the looming threat of a possible suspension of all judges who were associated with the former Workers' Party of Ethiopia, the abrupt resignation of the Minister of Justice, a lack of an operating police force. These types of abuses persisted throughout the remainder of the transitional period. Freedom of the press was limited; in the first half of 1994, at least twenty journalists were fined or jailed as a result of publishing content that challenged the government, a situation exacerbated by the fact that the contemporary press laws were vague and improperly implemented. Human rights organizations including the Ethiopian Human Rights Council were denied formal registration from the government but continued to process complaints and report abuses; the government accused the Council of being a politically-motivated group with a hidden agenda that favored opposition groups and reported false information. Individuals suspected to have been previously associated with the OLF were treated particularly harshly once they were detained in secret detention centers across the country. In areas ranging from the Hararghe region in eastern Ethiopia to the Wollega region in the west, detainees reported experiencing beatings, food deprivation, death threats, and rape as a result of being suspected to be sympathetic with the OLF's cause. Government forces also continued to employ lethal force during confrontations with demonstrators until the end of the TGE's hold on power, with numerous civilians killed by police at demonstrations and student protests.

Querino's pioneering ethnographic works focused on the contributions of Africans to Brazilian history and culture. Assessing his contributions, the historian E. Bradford Burns says, \\"Querino was the first black to write Brazilian history, a task to which he brought a much-needed perspective.\\"  Early life  Querino was born in Santo Amaro, Bahia in 1851. In 1855, both of his parents died during the cholera epidemic. Left an orphan at the age of four, he was sent to Salvador to be raised by a guardian, Manuel Correia Garcia, a journalist and professor at the Normal School, who would later found the Instituto Hist√≥rico da Bahia in 1856. At age seventeen, Querino moved to Pernambuco and later Piau√≠. There he was recruited to the Brazilian army. Querino served as a clerk at his battalion's Rio de Janeiro headquarters during the Paraguayan War. After the end of the Paraguayan War in March 1870, Querino returned to Salvador, Bahia. He dedicated himself to drawing and painting, which he studied at Salvador's Liceu de Artes e Of√≠cios as well as at the Academia de Belas Artes. Querino graduated in geometric design and taught at the Liceu and at the Col√©gio de √ìrf√£os de S√£o Joaquim. He produced two textbooks on geometric design. Manuel Querino was active in politics as an abolitionist, publishing articles favoring admission and joining the Bahian Abolition Society. He later founded the Partido Oper√°rio (Workers' Party) and the Liga Oper√°ria Baiana (Bahian Workers' League). Querino was a founder and charter member of the Bahian Geographical and Historical Institute (Instituto Geogr√°fico e Hist√≥rico da Bahia) in 1894. According to Burns, his membership and research brought some consideration of Afro-Brazilian perspectives and sources to this elite institution. Querino completed oral history interviews to gather information from black Bahians. He also used his contacts with Salvador's white elite to advocate for practitioners of Afro-Brazilian religions like Candombl√©. Quernio engaged in intellectual debates against the racist and elitist science of his time, spearheaded by pathologist Raimundo Nina Rodrigues.

He studied at Colegio Federal del Zulia until the age of fifteen, when he was sent by his parents to Marseille, France, to continue his education. The years he lived in France made him a keen supporter of the ideals of freedom of the French Republic.Tarre Murzi, Alfredo, Biograf√≠a de Maracaibo (Maracaibo biography), Ed. Bodini S.A., Barcelona, Spain, 1983. When he returned to Venezuela he started to work as a teacher of languages and professional drawing, but the autocratic government of president Antonio Guzm√°n Blanco motivated him to do something for freedom. This fact led him to start his career as a journalist, inspired by the ideas he had acquired in France.Olivares, Anton√≥genes, Siluetas ilustres del Zulia (Sillhouettes illustrious of Zulia), Government of Zulia State press, Maracaibo, Venezuela, 1963, Volume II.

Arctic Prince won two races including the 1951 Epsom Derby and was retired after breaking down at Ascot in July of the same year. Background Arctic Prince was a brown horse bred in Ireland by his owner Joseph McGrath. He was one of the first crop of foals sired by Prince Chevalier who won the Prix du Jockey Club in 1946 before going on to a successful stud career. Apart from Arctic Prince, his most notable offspring was Charlotteville who won the Prix du Jockey Club and the Grand Prix de Paris and sired the 1966 Derby winner Charlottown. Arctic Prince's dam, Arctic Sun, was a successful racemare who won the Anglesey Stakes in 1943. Arctic Prince was sent into training with Willie Stephenson at Royston, Hertfordshire. Racing career =1950: two-year-old season= Arctic Prince first appeared on the racecourse in a maiden race at Redcar in which he recorded a six length victory. He was then moved up in class for the Gimcrack Stakes at York in which he finished unplaced behind Cortil. =1951: three- year-old season= As a three-year-old, Arctic Prince was sent directly to the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse without a trial race. He ran on strongly in the closing stages of the one mile Classic to finish seventh of the twenty- seven runners behind Ki Ming. A month later, Arctic Prince started at odds of 28/1 in a field of thirty-three for the Epsom Derby, which, with a total prize of ¬£22,625 was the most valuable race ever run in England. He was ridden by Chuck Spares, a jockey who was best known for his successes in National Hunt racing and was having his first ride in the Derby. The crowd was estimated at up to 1,000,000 and included the Queen, and Princess Elizabeth, the King being too ill to attend. Ki Ming who started favourite, disputed the lead with Mystery IX until the horses turned into the straight. Arctic Prince, who was always prominent, overtook Mystery IX to take the lead early in the straight and pulled clear of the field to win easily by six lengths from Sybil's Nephew. Spares explained that \\"I took the lead and then it was all over.\\" Stephenson commented that Arctic Prince \\"was definitely unlucky to lose the 2000 Guineas and I thought that he would win today as I know that he stays.\\" In July Arctic Prince was sent to Ascot for the inaugural running of the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. The colt finished unplaced behind Supreme Court, sustaining an injury which ended his racing career. Assessment Timeform awarded Arctic Prince a rating of 135, the highest for a three-year-old in 1951. A rating of 130 is considered the mark of an above average European Group One winner. In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Arctic Prince an ‚Äúaverage‚Äù Derby winner and the one hundred and ninth best British racehorse of the 20th Century . Stud career Arctic Prince stood as a stallion in Britain for four years before being sold for a reported $900,000 and exported to America in 1956. The best of his European progeny was the Eclipse Stakes winner Arctic Explorer. He was also the damsire of the 1964 Derby winner Santa Claus.

It was the third McDonald's restaurant and opened on August 18, 1953. It was also the second restaurant franchised by Richard and Maurice McDonald, prior to the involvement of Ray Kroc in the company. The restaurant is now the oldest in the chain still in existence and is one of Downey's main tourist attractions. Along with its sign, it was deemed eligible for addition to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, although it was not added because the owner objected. History The McDonald brothers opened their first restaurant adjacent to the Monrovia Airport in 1937. It was a tiny octagonal building informally called The Airdrome. That octagonal building was later moved to 1398 North E Street in San Bernardino, California in 1940. It was originally a barbecue drive-in, but the brothers discovered that most of their profits came from hamburgers. In 1948, they closed their restaurant for three months, reopening it in December as a walk-up hamburger stand that sold hamburgers, potato chips, and orange juice; the following year, french fries and Coca-Cola were added to the menu. This simplified menu, and food preparation using assembly line principles, allowed them to sell hamburgers for 15 cents, or about half as much as at a sit-down restaurant. The restaurant was very successful, and the brothers started to franchise the concept in 1953. The first franchisee was Occidental Petroleum executive Neil Fox, who opened a restaurant at 4050 North Central Avenue in Phoenix, Arizona in May, for a flat fee of $1,000 (). His restaurant was the second to employ the McDonald brothers' Golden Arches standardized design, created by Southern California architect Stanley Clark Meston and his assistant Charles Fish. Fox's use of the \\"McDonald's\\" name evidently came as a surprise to the brothers, but all subsequent franchises (except for the third location in North Hollywood, CA, which operated as Peak's), used the \\"McDonald's\\" brand. (Although there was also a \\"Peak's\\" that had been franchised by McDonald Brothers on Foothill Blvd. in Pasadena, Golden Arches and all, at the foot of Hastings Ranch). Fox's brothers-in-law and business partners, Roger Williams and Bud Landon, were the franchisees for the fourth McDonald's, and used their expertise in siting gasoline stations in choosing the Downey location. Like the McDonald brothers' other franchisees, they were required to use Meston's design. The purchase of the chain from the McDonald brothers by Ray Kroc did not affect the Downey restaurant, as it was franchised under an agreement with the McDonald brothers, not with Kroc's company McDonald's Systems, Inc., which later became McDonald's Corporation. As a result, the restaurant was not subject to the modernization requirements that McDonald's Corporation placed on its franchisees. Its menu came to differ from that of other McDonald's restaurants, and lacked items such as the Big Mac that were developed in the corporation. In part due to these differences, as well as a corporate McDonald's opening in the mid 1970s less than a half mile away, the restaurant came to suffer poor sales, and was finally acquired by McDonald's Corporation in 1990, when it was the only remaining McDonald's that was independent of the chain. With low sales, damage from the 1994 Northridge earthquake, and the lack of a drive-up window and indoor seating, the restaurant was closed, and McDonald's planned to demolish it and incorporate some of its features in a modern \\"retro\\" restaurant nearby. However, it was listed on the National Trust for Historic Preservation's 1994 list of the 11 Most Endangered Historic Places. With both the public and preservationists demanding the restaurant be saved, McDonald's spent two years restoring the restaurant and reopened it. Customers today can visit the restored restaurant and an adjoining gift shop and museum. Other early McDonald's restaurants The site of the first McDonald's restaurant, San Bernardino, California. Only part of the sign remains from the original structure. Very few early McDonald's restaurants remain, largely because McDonald's Corporation required its franchisees to update their buildings. The original hexagonal McDonald's hamburger stand in San Bernardino was demolished in 1953 to be replaced by a building in the now familiar Golden Arches style; in an oversight, the McDonald brothers failed to retain rights to the McDonald's name when they sold the chain to Kroc, and were forced to rename it \\"The Big M\\". It went out of business and was demolished in 1972, although part of the sign remains; an independent McDonald's museum was opened on the site in 1998. Other early buildings still standing include the seventh McDonald's, at 1057 East Mission Boulevard in Pomona, California, which is now a doughnut shop (currently the second-oldest existing McDonald's building). The 11th McDonald's at 1900 South Central Avenue in Los Angeles, (later a taco restaurant), was demolished in 2016. Kroc's 1955 McDonald's franchise in Des Plaines, Illinois, the ninth in the chain, was demolished in 1984, but a replica was built on the original foundation and is now described as the McDonald's No. 1 Store Museum. It was torn down, with the sign removed in January 2018. A single-arch McDonald's sign at 2801 S. Olive Street, Pine Bluff, Arkansas, dating from 1962, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. A restaurant built in 1962 at 2434 Almaden Road in San Jose, California, is the only other remaining early McDonald's still in operation in the state, although a modern restaurant is now attached to it. This location is listed as one of the city's historic resources. An early McDonald's stood at 9100 SE Powell Boulevard in Portland, Oregon, on Southeast 91st Avenue and Powell Boulevard. It was not attached to the adjacent McDonald's but was available for party rentals. It was demolished on February 22, 2018, to be replaced by a new McDonald's with self-service kiosks.Matthew Korfhage,\\"The Third Oldest McDonald's in America Will Be Demolished In Portland Next Month\\", Willamette Week, January 26, 2018. Retrieved 2018-01-27. The site of the original McDonald's on 1398 North E Street in San Bernardino was purchased in 1998 by Albert Okura, owner of the Juan Pollo chicken restaurant chain, for $135,000 in a foreclosure sale. Okura turned the property into the headquarters for his chain of restaurants and opened an unofficial McDonald's museum on the site, which, due to communications with McDonald's, Okura refers to as the \\"historic site of the original McDonald's\\". Okura said though he did not intend to open the museum, an erroneous news story that mentioned he was planning on opening a museum gave him the idea; former employees and customers sent the museum many of the items on display.

The subfamily currently has 8 recognized genera and 17 species. Densoviruses are known to infect members of insect orders Blattodea, Diptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Orthoptera, while some viruses infect and multiply in crustaceans such as shrimp or crayfish, or sea stars from phylum Echinodermata. Virology Densoviruses are small (18‚Äì26 nanometers in diameter) and non enveloped. Virions are icosahedral in shape with triangulation number (T) = 1. There are 60 copies of the coat protein in the virion. Each copy has a shape described as a \\"quadrilateral 'kite-shaped' wedge\\", and the appearance of the surface is rough with many small projections. Virions do not appear to contain lipids. Genomes are non- segmented, about 4‚Äì6 kilobases in length and usually contain two or three open reading frames. The 5' open reading frame encodes two nonstructural proteins (NS-1 and NS-2) and the 3' open reading frame encodes two or three capsid proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3). Both the 5' and 3' termini have hairpin loops. If a third open reading frame is present (depends on the genus) it encodes a second non structural protein. The genome is anmbisense, encoding proteins on both the positive sense and negative sense directions. Transcriptional regulation and post-transcriptional modification are used to produce different nonstructural proteins and structural proteins. Virions enter the host cell is achieved by attachment to host receptors, which may be mediated by clathrin- mediated endocytosis or clathrin-independent dynamin-dependent endocytosis. The NS-1 protein has a superfamily 3 DNA helicase and an HuH endonuclease motif. These motifs are common in small DNA viruses. The proteins that contain these motifs bind to the viral origins of replication and unwind and nick these origins, allowing access by the host's proteins to the viral genome for replication and transcription. The genome is replicated by a unique rolling hairpin mechanism. DNA-templated transcription, with some alternative splicing mechanism is the manner of transcription. Taxonomy Eight genera are currently recognized, containing a combined 17 species: *Aquambidensovirus *Blattambidensovirus *Hemiambidensovirus *Iteradensovirus *Miniambidensovirus *Pefuambidensovirus *Protoambidensovirus *Scindoambidensovirus Ambidensovirus was previously recognized as a genus, but in 2019 it was split into the six genera prefixed with Aqu-, Blatt-, Hemi-, Pefu-, Proto-, and Scindo-.

She was born in a barrio of Santiago, and lived in poverty throughout her life, working as a seamstress from an early age. At the time the War of the Pacific began she was only 13 years old, and had been orphaned and twice widowed. Her second husband was executed by the Bolivian military for killing a soldier. She tried to pass herself as a man and enlist as a soldier in the Chilean Army. This failed, but she was given a position as an unofficial cantini√®re and military nurse, marching alongside the infantrymen to sell food and drink, and caring for the wounded after battles. Despite being given a noncombatant role, she fought alongside the men of her unit in the battles of the Tarapac√° Campaign in late 1879, at Pisagua and San Francisco. Her valor in these battles and her care for wounded men drew the attention of Chilean commander-in-chief Manuel Baquedano, who provided her with official recognition and the rank of a sergeant. She continued to serve in the army for the duration of the war and was famously courageous at the Battle of Tacna in 1880. After the war, she returned to civilian life and died in obscurity, aged only 25. Now considered one of Chile's greatest heroes of the war, her service only became widely known after her death.  Early life  Morales was born on 1 April 1865 in La Chimba, a barrio on the Mapocho River in Santiago de Chile, the daughter of carpenter Ventura Morales and Marta Infante. Her father died when she was young, and she moved with her mother to Valparaiso. There she started to learn her mother's trade as a seamstress until her mother married her to an older man in 1877, at age 11. Her husband died during the first year of their marriage, and her mother died about the same time. Left without any family, Morales headed for Antofagasta, then a port town in Bolivia that was booming due to the nitrate mines in the area. She travelled there as a steerage passenger, with a ticket she bought by selling nearly all of her possessions. While working there, she met Santiago Pizarro, a Chilean in his 30s who made his living in a Bolivian military band, and married him in mid-1878, aged 13. He was tried and executed on 21 September of that year for killing a Bolivian soldier in a drunken brawl. She found his body dumped by the side of the railway tracks and took a gold ring from his finger, which she wore for the rest of her life. Pizarro's execution was widely protested by the mostly Chilean population of Antofagasta, which resented what was seen as an unjust Bolivian government.  Military service  On 14 February 1879, Chilean forces entered Antofagasta to the welcome of most of the local population, beginning the War of the Pacific against Bolivia and Peru. Many locals enlisted in the Chilean Army, and Morales enlisted as a soldier to avenge her husband by disguising herself as a man and slipping in unnoticed amid the frenzy of patriotism. Her deception did not last long, for Capt. Herm√≥genes C√°mus saw through her disguise immediately‚Äîbecause of her curved figure and \\"feminine beauty,\\" he said. Nonetheless, he allowed her to be an unauthorised army cantini√®re and nurse. These were the only positions available to women in the army at the time, and many women effectively served as both, which Morales did. As a cantini√®re, she sold food and drink to supplement soldiers' monotonous basic rations, staying with them at their camp and marching with them on operations, and since she was a nurse, she had to be present immediately after battles to care for the wounded. Morales was first sent to C√°mus's unit, the 3rd Regiment of the Line, which was at the front of Chile's campaigns during much of the war. Although she officially was not a soldier and was not supposed to participate in combat, this did not deter her from fighting alongside the men of her regiment. Indeed, she was noted for her great skill with a rifle. She fought at the amphibious landing and fierce ensuing assault on a Peruvian position of the Battle of Pisagua on 2 November 1879 and at the Battle of San Francisco on 19 November. She was looked up to by the men of her unit for her selfless nursing of the wounded after battles. She also put herself at risk several times to save captured Peruvian soldiers from being abused by her compatriots. Hearing of her deeds, the commander-in-chief of Chile's military, General Manuel Baquedano, summoned Morales to meet him and officially authorised her to wear the uniform of a cantini√®re (as she had done so without authorisation before) and gave her the rank and pay of a sergeant (sargento segundo, lit. \\"second sergeant\\"). She later moved to the 4th Division, in which she served during the Tacna and Arica Campaign. At the Battle of Tacna on 26 May 1880, she continued to provide water to the exhausted men at the front lines after she received a slight wound herself. She was one of the first soldiers to enter the city of Tacna that evening, and soldiers of the Carabineros de Yungay cavalry regiment recalled her riding into the town on a horse, raising her rifle as they passed by and crying \\"Viva Chile!\\". After the battle, she was stricken for some time with an illness she picked up from prisoners of war she had cared for, and she wrote a letter to a friend of hers in Antofagasta, assuming she was on her deathbed. Nonetheless, later writers said she was present at the Battle of Arica two weeks later and ordered the mass killing of captured Peruvians, an account also inscribed on a Peruvian memorial to the dead. During January 1881, she fought at the Battle of Chorillos and Battle of Miraflores and was among the Chileans who entered Lima after the city was captured. An engraving of Morales from Vicu√±a Mackenna's newspaper El Nuevo Ferrocarril (1881) While all her contemporaries in Chile recognised her heroism, and the common soldiers she served with looked up to her as the \\"nun of charity,\\" some men said Morales had gone too far for a woman by taking up a rifle. Benjam√≠n Vicu√±a Mackenna praised her for her dedication and bravery and for her hatred for those who killed her husband, but in 1881 gave her the free advice that she should not put herself at such risk and should \\"return quietly to her poor home and restart the life of a real woman in manual labor, in caring for her relatives, in work with the needle and thimble, and exchange, after several years of adventures and passions, the revolver for her honored and beloved sewing machine.\\" She did not follow this advice and remained in the army until the end of the war, fighting in the Battle of Huamachuco on 10 July 1883, the last battle of the war. Men like Mackenna were right to say she put herself at unusual risk for a woman at the time, for several other Chilean cantini√®res were killed after being captured by Peruvians during the war.  Later life and legacy  After the end of the war, Morales returned to her birthplace of Santiago. While few knew of her actions during the war, the men she served alongside remembered her well. When she appeared at the unveiling of the monument to the common Chilean roto at the Plaza Yungay, she received some of the most enthusiastic applause. After years of illness, she died in anonymity in the common room of a Santiago hospital on 25 August 1890, aged only 25. For her, widespread recognition came only after her death. On 25 August 1930, 40 years after her death, Col. Enrique Phillips wrote an article dedicated to her in El Mercurio that brought her into attention, in which he praised her in the highest terms, saying: \\"The Judiths of Chile were many in that glorious time, but none exceeded in valour Irene Morales, the paragon of Chilean women.\\" In the years after her death, a number of poems were written on her, including one by R√≥mulo Larra√±aga, and she was featured in many works of patriotic literature. A street near the Plaza Baquedano in Santiago is named in her honour, the Calle Irene Morales. During the turbulent years of the 1970s, she was among the historical Chilean women embraced as symbols by both conservative and left-wing women's political organisations. In modern times, she has been described as one of Chile's \\"greatest heroes\\" of the War of the Pacific. Her remains are kept in the Military Mausoleum at the Cementerio General de Santiago, which is maintained by the Chilean Army. Morales is often compared to Candelaria P√©rez, a Chilean cantini√®re of the earlier War of the Confederation who was also praised for her courage and who also came from La Chimba.

It resulted from an illicit love affair between Elokeshi, the wife of a government employee Nobin Chandra, and the Brahmin head priest (or mahant) of the Tarakeswar Shiva temple. Nobin subsequently decapitated his wife Elokeshi because of the love affair. A highly publicised trial followed, dubbed the Tarakeswar murder case of 1873, in which both the husband and the mahant were found guilty in varying degrees. Bengali society considered the mahants actions as punishable and criminal, while justifying Nobin's action of killing an unchaste wife. The resulting public outrage forced authorities to release Nobin after two years. The scandal became the subject of Kalighat paintings and several popular Bengali plays, which often portrayed Nobin as a devoted husband. The mahant was generally presented as a womaniser, who took advantage of young women. The murder victim Elokeshi was sometimes blamed as a seductress and the root cause of the affair. In other plays, she was absolved of all guilt and was portrayed to have been tricked and raped by the mahant. Summary The trial of the Tarakeswar scandal. Clockwise from left top: the court clerk, British judge, lawyer, the mahant in the witness box, Nabin with havildar (policeman). Elokeshi's corpse and the murder weapon in the centre. Elokeshi, the sixteen-year-old housewife of the Bengali government employee Nobin Chandra (Nobinchandra/Nabinchandra/Nobin Chandra) Banerjee, lived in the village of Tarakeswar with her parents, while Nobin was away for work in a military press in Calcutta. She approached Madhavchandra Giri, the \\"powerful\\" mahant of the popular and prosperous Tarakeswar temple, seeking fertility medication; however the mahant allegedly seduced and raped her. An affair began with the \\"connivance\\" of Elokeshi's parents. When Nobin returned to the village, he learned about the affair from village gossip. Nobin was publicly humiliated following the discovery of the affair. He confronted Elokeshi, who confessed and begged him for forgiveness. Not only did Nobin forgive her but he decided to run away with her from Tarakeswar. However, the mahant did not allow the couple to escape; his goons blocked their way. Overcome with anger and jealousy, Nobin slit his wife's throat with a fish knife, decapitating her, on 27 May 1873. Full of remorse, Nobin surrendered to the local police station and confessed his crime. The Tarakeswar murder case of 1873 (Queen vs Nobin Chandra Banerjee) first stood in the Hoogly Sessions Court at Serampore in south-west Bengal. The Indian jury acquitted Nobin, accepting his plea of insanity, but the British judge Field overruled the jury's decision and forwarded the matter to the Calcutta High Court. However, Judge Field accepted that there was an adulterous relationship between Elokeshi and the mahant, with whom she was seen \\"joking and flirting\\". Judge Markby, who presided over the case in the High Court, also accepted the evidence proving adultery. The High Court convicted both Nobin and the mahant. Nobin was sentenced to life imprisonment; the mahant got 3 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of ‚Çπ2000. Public reaction The newspaper Bengalee remarked: \\"People flock to the Sessions Court as they would flock to the Lewis Theatre to watch Othello being performed\\". The courtroom drama became a public spectacle. Authorities had to charge an entrance fee to control the crowds at the Hoogly Sessions Court. The right of admission was also restricted to those literate in English, citing that the mahant's British lawyer and the judge only spoke in English. The overruling of the Indian jury's decision by the Sessions Court judge was heavily debated. According to Swati Chattopadhyay (author of Representing Calcutta: Modernity, Nationalism and the Colonial Uncanny), the court proceedings were seen as an interference by the British in local matters. The court represented a conflict between village and city, the priest and bhadralok (Bengali gentleman class) and the colonial state and nationalist subjects. The court proceedings were disturbed several times by crowds demanding clemency for Nobin or stringency for the mahant. The mahant and his English lawyer were often attacked outside the court. The mahant's punishment was termed lenient by the Bengali public. Nobin was released in 1875, following several public petitions for pardon. Such pleas came from members of the Calcutta elite and district town notables, local royals and \\"acknowledged leaders of native society\\", as well as from the \\"lower middle class\\"‚Äîfrom whom a 10,000-signature mercy plea was received. The mahant turns an oil press in prison. The 1873 mahant‚ÄìElokeshi incident was not the first incident against a mahant of Tarakeswar. Mahant Shrimanta Giri was executed in 1824 for the murder of his mistress's lover. However, according to Sarkar (author of Hindu wife, Hindu nation), while the 1824 scandal hardly created any public outrage and faded quickly from public memory, the 1873 affair was embedded in public memory and created a huge sensation in contemporary Bengal. When a satyagraha was organised against the reigning mahant of Tarakeswar, Satish Giri, in 1974 for his sexual and financial misconduct, the 1873 affair was alluded to several times. A regional daily reported that the mahant's affair with Elokeshi was still discussed by the common people of Bengal, who did not know of other current affairs, even six months after the murder. Bengali newspapers followed the court trial on a day-to-day basis, often reporting it verbatim and capturing the responses of all parties involved: judges, jury, lawyers and the common man. The \\"culpability\\" of each of the characters of the scandal was debated, and British justice and Hindu norms were analysed, especially by British-owned newspapers. While Missionaries interpreted the public outcry against the mahant as the \\"disenchantment\\" of the Hindus, British-owned newspapers also pondered over the question of asserting more control on Hindu temples and organisations. In an era when Hindu reform movements were blossoming in Bengal, the scandal led the reformist as well as orthodox society to re-examine \\"the relationship between Hindu norms, leaders and women\\". Many products were specially manufactured to commemorate the event. Saris, fish knives, betel-leaf boxes and other memorabilia with Elokeshi's name printed or inscribed on them were made. A balm for headache was advertised as using the oil made by the mahant in the jail oil press. Such commemorative items were still in sale in as late as 1894. These items were unique in the sense that they were the only such commemorative items modelled on an event. In the arts At least 34 farces were published by the \\"popular press\\" on the events of the Tarakeswar affair‚Äîthe rape, the murder and the trial. At least four of these were reprinted several times. This is the largest number of 19th-century farces in Bengal created in response to a contemporary event. Farces and plays of the era were often inspired by the real courtroom drama. At least 19 plays were also based on the scandal, all of which became very popular and big money-makers; especially Mohanter Ei ki Kaj! became a huge hit on stage. Plays written as late as 1924 referred to the affair as if it was common public knowledge. Numerous Kalighat paintings and Battala woodwork prints‚Äîcreated in the decade after the scandal‚Äîdepicted the \\"immoral\\" affair, the gruesome murder and the resultant trial. According to Chattopadhyay (author of Representing Calcutta: modernity, nationalism, and the colonial uncanny), it was the popularity of the plays combined with \\"the rhetoric of sin and morality\\" that inspired Kalighat painters to present this \\"tragedy as a spectacle\\". Kalighat painters often chose to paint mythological themes and Bengali day-to-day life; the paintings on the Tarakeswar affair were a unique exception. Often painted as a series, the Kalighat paintings depict various scenes related to the affair: the mahant riding on an elephant howdah; The Meeting of Elokeshi and the mahant‚ÄîElokeshi goes to the temple with her sister and meets the mahant; The Seduction‚ÄîElokeshi offering paan (betel nut leaf), the mahant fans Elokeshi and/or the mahant offering her childbirth medicine in order to drug her before raping her; Elokeshi embracing Nobin and asking his forgiveness; the three stages of the murder such as The Fatal/First Blow (Nobin about to decapitate Elokeshi with a fish knife) and After the murder (Nobin with the decapitated body of Elokeshi). The Kalighat paintings also depict a courtroom scene of the trial of the mahant followed by the mahant in jail, enduring rigorous labour turning an oil press or working as a jail gardener, while jail guards or the superintendent watch over him. The plays and the paintings suggested the theme of loss of traditional Indian culture in the face of colonialism. Assessment and portrayal of the characters Most accounts agree that Nobin loved his wife dearly, evidenced by the fact that he was ready to accept his wife at first and run away with her, even after knowledge of the affair. In an era where the chastity of a wife was highly valued, Nobin's blind love and acceptance of a guilty wife were deemed inappropriate by a large section of society. Her murder was considered justifiable. Some songs criticise Nobin's stupidity of trying to save his adulterous wife and thereby risking his own life. Police reports, confirming Nobin's love, read that after the murder, Nobin rushed to the police saying: \\"Hang me quick. This world is wilderness to me. I am impatient to join my wife in the next [world/life]\\", a line reported verbatim in newspapers as well as used in plays and songs. Some public petitions argued that given a choice to leave Elokeshi in the arms of the mahant to live a life of dishonour‚Äîwhich was worse than death‚Äîand to kill her, like a true husband, Nobin chose the latter to end her misery. However, some plays portray that Nobin has a mistress in town so leaves his wife in the village. The mahant offers Elokeshi childbirth medicine, to drug her before raping her Most of the plays were named to suggest the main crime was not Elokeshi's murder by Nobin, but the immoral activities of the mahant. The mahant is portrayed as the root cause of Elokeshi's death, which was an \\"inevitable conclusion\\" of the mahant 's activities. Elokeshi, \\"the object of desire\\", had to be killed by Nobin to restore his honour. Titles of such plays reinforce the theme and focus on the mahant's crime. Examples include: Mohanter Chakrabhraman, Mohanter Ki Saja, Mohanter Karabash and Mohanter Ei Ki Dasha. The Kalighat paintings and Battala woodcuts often depict the mahant as a womaniser and the temple as \\"a haven for pimps\\". He was also described as \\"a vile seducer\\". The Tarakeswar shrine was a famed cure for barren women. The mahant was rumoured to seduce women like Elokeshi who came to him for childbirth medicine and appropriate them with the help of his goons. After being raped, the women could not return to their family and languished in the brothels of Tarakeswar. In most plays, the mahant is described as drugging Elokeshi‚Äîby offering fake childbirth medicine‚Äîand then raping her. In the play Mohanter Dafarafa, a rare exception to the general theme of immorality in plays where the mahant misuses Elokeshi, his love is portrayed to be genuine and her seduction by him a resultant after- effect. However, later he is repentant. The Bengalee, a reformist newspaper, presents a rare view of the true victim Elokeshi being forgotten in the debate of the trial and sympathy towards Nobin. In the First Meeting painting, Elokeshi is sometimes depicted as a courtesan, indicating that she is the one who seduces the mahant. She is often described as unchaste and to have developed the adulterous affair and even lived with him for some time despite the fact that he first rapes her. In one play, Elokeshi's character is debated by village wives and prostitutes. The wives vilify Elokeshi as an unchaste woman, question her devotion for Nobin and express the belief that a woman cannot be raped without her consent. The prostitutes empathise with Elokeshi, another victim of male lust and lament her fall from grace, which for them illustrates the brittle status of a wife. Some plays depict Elokeshi as having no choice but to surrender to the mahant's lust on her father's command. Such plays concentrate more on scenes where Elokeshi gives in to her father's orders than on the depiction of rape. One farce depicts a divine trial of not only Elokeshi and the mahant, but also of her parents, who are portrayed as being equally guilty. Elokeshi is condemned for seducing the mahant and tarnishing the name of the holy shrine of Tarakeswar. The mahant is punished for misusing the authority and money of the temple. One newspaper describes Elokeshi's father as \\"the still worse scoundrel (worse than the mahant) who bartered his daughter's virtue\\". In many plays, Elokeshi's father, who is now sexually incompetent, is driven by the greed of Elokeshi's young stepmother and he resorts to pleasing his wife by giving gifts like jewellery, for which he sells off his daughter to the mahant. Elokeshi's staying at her parents' home‚Äîand not with her husband‚Äîis also blamed for their excessive control over her.

Located in the Castle Park region of the park, it is the largest rock shelter in the area. It was discovered before 1921 by local ranchers, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Mantle. Mrs. Mantle is reported to have done some excavation of the site, followed up by the Penrose-Taylor expedition of 1933 from Colorado College and the Fountain Valley School, which designated the site \\"Cave One.\\" The site is a significant resource for the Fremont culture and is among the best resources in northwestern Colorado. Excavations in the 1930s and 1940s yielded significant material on the Fremont people and their relationship to the later Ancestral Puebloans. Investigation The cave was found to have dwelling sites and granaries, with pottery shards, baskets and hunting tools recovered. An extensive excavation was undertaken by the University of Colorado Museum in 1939 and 1940, led by Charles R. Scoggin, a student assistant at the museum, and Edison P. Lohr. The survey found the most significant artifacts in small holes that were probably meant to be temporary caches, including stone and bone projectile points, stone tools, bones, beads, robe seeds, fragments of clothing and footwear and other objects. The most significant discovery was a bag containing a feathered headdress, beads and other objects. Investigations were interrupted by World War II. Scoggin was killed in action at the Anzio beachhead, Italy in 1944. Limited work resumed in 1947 and 1948 under Robert Burgh, finding little additional material. No human remains were found by either party. The investigators concluded that the site was used primarily for storage. Little sign of long-term habitation was found, attributed to the cave's northern exposure and elevation of , which would have made it an uncomfortable dwelling. Artifacts are primary associated with the Fremont culture. Excavations suggested that there was an earlier period of use, based on the finding of charcoal at depth. Excavations have not been pursued in this layer. In all, 53 built or excavated features have been identified. Several prehistoric petroglyphs and some modern graffiti exist in the alcove. Findings of the two expeditions were published by Burgh (with posthumous authorship by Scoggin) in 1948 as The Archeology of Castle Park, Dinosaur National Monument. Description The alcove faces north. It is wider than it is deep, about wide and about deep, with an area of about . It is sited about south of the Yampa River, about higher than the river. Located in Permian and Pennsylvanian Weber sandstone, the alcove stands just below the rim of a bench in the valley walls.

It is near the Firth of Clyde in Inverclyde, in the former county of Renfrewshire. The three-storey ruin of the 15th century tower house is protected as a category B listed building. Location The castle is sited on a promontory of a raised beach jutting out at a height of above coastal flats, with a level top defended by steep slopes or cliffs to each side of the point. At one time, this was the location of a watch tower to fend off Viking raiders. Inverkip Castle later became an important medieval fortress. History Ardgowan Castle atop south-east facing cliff Inverkip Castle featured in what was later called the First War of Scottish Independence. In 1301, king Edward I of England sent two armies into Scotland, with the plan that they would meet up at Inverkip. The main force under his own command struck through the east of Scotland, while his son Edward, Prince of Wales, commanded a western army which captured Turnberry Castle and Bothwell Castle, but the armies then met at Linlithgow to overwinter. In 1302 Robert the Bruce, Earl of Carrick, submitted homage to Edward of England, and on 12 May 1303 Bruce provided forces to a muster at Roxburgh. While Edward invaded the east of Scotland, in July he ordered a contingent including Bruce and Aymer de Valence to press up through Clydesdale, and meet a large seaborne force led by Bruce's father-in-law the Earl of Ulster which attacked Rothesay Castle then besieged Inverkip Castle. By early September the joint force had taken both fortresses. Bruce is said to have taken part in the fight to seize Inverkip Castle, and then had the task of getting the siege engines north for the English assault on Stirling Castle: on 16 April 1304 Edward wrote to thank Bruce, referring in particular to the problem of finding \\"a waggon fit to carry the frame\\" of \\"the great engine of Inverkip\\". In 1306, Inverkip was held for Edward by the Lothian Scot Sir Adam Gordon. Around mid March the castle was besieged by supporters of King Robert the Bruce, led by Robert Boyd of Cunningham. On 24 July 1306, after Bruce's defeat at the Battle of Methven, Edward gave orders that Sir Thomas Randolph was to be held prisoner in Inverkip castle, supervised by Gordon, with no option of bail: by September of 1307 he had apparently been freed. When Bruce's ally Sir James Douglas defeated Sir Philip Mowbray in 1307, Sir Philip left his forces and escaped to Inverkip Castle, as described in John Barbour's The Brus: Sync throu the Largis, him allane Till Ennerkip the way he tane, Rigcht to the castell that wes then Stuffyt all with Ingless men, That him resaiffyt in daynte.G Blair (1907) Greenock Street Names: Their History and Romance The English men later escaped from the castle by sea. =The Ardgowan Estate= Ardgowan House. In 1403, King Robert III granted the lands of Ardgowan to his natural son, Sir John Stewart. Ardgowan castle, now a ruin, is a tower house built within the site of the earlier castle, and is dated to the late 15th century. It is sited on the south edge of the promontory, perched on a cliff. In 1667 Archibald Stewart was created a baronet. The 3rd baronet married, in 1730, Helen Houston, heiress of the Shaws of Greenock. Their son Sir John Shaw Stewart, 4th Baronet, commissioned a design for Ardgowan House from the architect Hugh Cairncross. Construction began in 1797, and was completed around 1801, after which the old castle was abandoned. Its ruin was consolidated and repaired in 1936.
