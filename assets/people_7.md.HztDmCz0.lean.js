TRIAC was born a year later; its main objective was to create an official body of translators and interpreters to help regulate the profession in Catalonia. Both associations operated separately for ten years. In 2006, however, the law on practicing professions requiring academic degrees and professional bodies was introduced, which removed the option to create an official body of translators and interpreters.

Built in 1857, it is one of state's best examples of Italianate villa architecture executed in brick. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. It presently houses offices. Description and history The Day-Taylor House is located in Hartford's Sheldon-Charter Oak neighborhood, on the west side of Wethersfield Avenue directly opposite the Armsmear estate house of Samuel Colt. It is a 2-1/2 story masonry structure, built out of red brick in a roughly L-shaped plan. It has a hip roof, and a three-story tower rising at the crook of the ell. Both the main roof and tower roof have extended eaves with evenly spaced heavy brackets. Windows on the first two levels are generally set in pairs in rectangular openings with bracketed hoods, although some are set in round-arch openings. Some windows have original cast iron balconies. There are small windows of different shapes in the attic story, including a round-arch window set at the center of the main front-facing facade. A single-story veranda, supported by Corinthian columns, is arrayed around the base of the tower. The interior of the building retains little original styling. The house was built in 1857 by Hirim Bushnell, the builder of the Connecticut State Capitol and the Memorial Arch in Bushnell Park. It was built for Albert F. Day, a prominent local merchant whose father was Lieutenant Governor of Connecticut. Although its architect is not known, the house bears some resemblance to works of New Haven architect Henry Austin, a champion of the Italianate villa form.

The 8888 Citizens' Complaint Center is managed by the Office of the Executive Secretary which coordinates with the concerned government agency for the prompt resolution of public grievances and to provide feedback on the action taken on citizens' concerns within 72 hours. A show entitled, Digong 8888 Hotline, was thereafter launched by the People's Television Network in July 2019 to address queries or grievances from the public directed to government agencies, bureaus and offices that are sourced from field interviews, social media, and actual case studies from the hotline and the Presidential Complaint Center.

Introduced in 2012, the CCB served as the national government's helpdesk providing a public feedback mechanism linking the public and certain frontline government agencies. The CCB was established by the Civil Service Commission and the Information and Communications Technology Office‚ÄìNational Computer Center of the Department of Science and Technology to support the implementation of Republic Act 9485 or the Anti-Red Tape Act of 2007. From its inception in 2012 to June 2016, the Civil Service Commission facilitated a total of 175,481 transactions ranging from calls, e-mails and SMS messages through the Contact Center ng Bayan. 8888 hotline was launched on August 1, 2016 along with the new emergency hotline 9-1-1. On October 14, 2016, President Rodrigo Duterte signed Executive Order No. 6 which institutionalized the hotline and established the 8888 Citizens' Complaint Center. The order placed the contact center under the supervision of the Office of the Cabinet Secretary and also directed the office to provide other communication channels for public complaints, such as SMS, e-mail, website and social networking sites. The order also provides for administrative sanctions to be imposed on government officials who fail to respond timely to the complaints received through the hotline. As of January 2017, the 8888 Citizens' Complaint Center receives more than 1,000 complaints from the public per day. According to Civil Service Commission Chairperson Alicia de la Rosa‚ÄìBala, the government agencies the complaint center received the most complaints about since its inception in August 2016 were the Social Security System regarding release of pensions and benefits, the Land Transportation Office regarding the issuance of plates and licenses, the Home Development Mutual Fund or PAGIBIG regarding loan grants, the Bureau of Internal Revenue regarding processing of papers, and the Land Registration Authority regarding the issuance of land titles.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=433733 on 2017-05-19 Description The length of the shell attains 7.8 mm, its diameter 3.1 mm. The shell has an oval-fusiform shape. It contains 8 whorls, of which 2 smooth whorls in the protoconch, the rest are slightly convex. This species can at once be recognized by the deep-brown suture, the band encircling the middle of the body whorl, which is continuous and not interrupted by the straight longitudinal ribs, and the paler band towards the base. The spiral lirations are almost equidistant, and slightly nodulous on traversing the costae. And the fine striations between them are from two to four in number. The uppermost denticle within the outer lip (that is, the one which borders the little sinus) is somewhat larger than the other 10 denticles. The columella is straight and is furnished with numerous small tubercles and transverse lirations, somewhat irregularly situated, the former, however, being near the exterior margin of the thin callosity which spreads out on the columella, and the latter further within the small and narrow aperture.Smith, Edgar A. \\"A List of Marine Shells, chiefly from the Solomon Islands, with Descriptions of several new Species.\\" Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society 12.64 (1876): 535-562 Distribution This marine species occurs off the Solomon Islands.

Retrieved June 29th, 2019. Key results of her research include the following: * The productivity of the average worker is at least 50% higher under piece rates than under relative incentives, as workers partially internalize the negative social externality of their effort under relative incentives - though only when they can monitor and be monitored -, but don't do so under piece rates (with Imran Rasul and Iwan Barankay).Bandiera, O., Barankay, I., Rasul, I. (2005). Social Preferences and the Response to Incentives: Evidence from Personnel Data. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 120(3), pp. 917-962. Moreover, the introduction of managerial performance pay is found to result in an increase in both the mean and dispersion of worker productivity, mainly due to managers targeting their efforts toward high ability workers and selecting out the least able workers.Bandiera, O., Barankay, I., Rasul, I. (2007). Incentives for Managers and Inequality among Workers: Evidence from a Firm-Level Experiment. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 122(2), pp. 729-773. By contrast, when managers are paid piece rates, they tend to concentrate on workers with whom they are socially connected irrespective of their ability; overall, even though social connections increase the performance of connected workers, favouritism towards well-connected workers is found to be detrimental to the firm's overall performance.Bandiera, O., Barankay, I., Rasul, I. (2009). Social Connections and Incentives in the Workplace: Evidence from Personnel Data. Econometrica, 77(4), pp. 1047-1094. Moreover, workers who have at least one friend who is more able than themselves are willing to increase their effort and hence productivity by 10% (and vice versa if the worker is more able than their friends), which suggests that firms can exploit social incentives as an alternative to monetary incentives to motivate workers.Bandiera, O., Barankay, I., Rasul, I. (2010). Social Incentives in the Workplace. Review of Economic Studies, 77(2), pp. 417-458. Finally, strengthening team incentives, either through rankings or tournaments, is found to make workers more likely to form teams with others of similar ability instead of with their friends, with rank incentives decreasing average productivity by 14% and tournament incentives increasing it by 24%.Bandiera, O., Barankay, I., Rasul, I. (2013). Team Incentives: Evidence from a Firm Level Experiment. Journal of the European Economic Association, 11(5), pp. 1079-1114. * The relationship between the decision of farmers in Mozambique to adopt a new crop and the adoption choices of their network of family and friends is inverse-U shaped, mitigated by the farmers' own information, and uncorrelated among individuals of different religions (with Imran Rasul).[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-0297.2006.01115.x Bandiera, O., Rasul, I.

Economic Journal, 116(514), pp. 869-902. * Financial liberalization in Chile, Ghana, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Turkey and Zimbabwe failed to increase saving and - especially concerning policies aimed at relaxing liquidity constraints - may have depressed savings (with Patrick Honohan, Fabio Schiantarelli and Gerard Caprio).Bandiera, O. et al. (2000). Does Financial Reform Raise or Reduce Saving? Review of Economics and Statistics, 82(2), pp. 239-263. * The Sicilian Mafia originated in landowners attempts to protect their land against predatory attacks at a time of widespread banditry, even as doing so deflected thieves on others' properties.Bandiera, O.

Journal of Law, Economics & Organization, 19(1), pp. 218-244. * Highly talented and risk- tolerant managers tend to match with firms that value these characteristics most; a wide array of empirical regularities can be accounted for by a simple model where incentives and matches are endogenously determined (with Luigi Guiso, Andrea prat, and Rafaella Sadun).Bandiera, O. et al. (2015). Matching Firms, Managers, and Incentives. Journal of Labor Economics, 33(3), pp. 623-681. * The effect size of university class sizes is only negative and significant for the smallest and largest ranges of class sizes (-0.108 at average class size), with top-scoring students most affected by changes in class size (with Valentino Larcinese and Imran Rasul).Bandiera, O., Larcinese, V., Rasul, I.

(2017). Labor Markets and Poverty in Village Economies. Quarterly Journal of Economics, 132(2), pp. 811-870. * Providing non-financial rewards to agents recruited by a public health organization to promote HIV prevention and sell condoms in Lusaka (Zambia) was more effective than either financial rewards or volunteering, with the effect of both rewards complementing agents' pro-social motivations and both rewards' effectiveness increasing in their relative value (with Nava Ashraf and Kelsey Jack).Ashraf, N., Bandiera, O., Jack, B.K.

In 1948, she joined the Sisters of Loretto and went on to teach in Texas and Missouri. In 1957, she graduated with a master's degree from the University of Notre Dame, and in 1959, was transferred to work at Webster College, becoming Vice President in 1960. In 1965, Wexler succeeded Sister Francetta Barberis as president of the college. She soon began major reforms, improving curricula, renovating and expanding the campus, and initiating volunteer service programs. In 1967, Grennan completed Webster College's transition to lay ownership, and she herself left her religious order. In 1969, she became President of Hunter College in Manhattan, part of the City University of New York. There, she dealt with student protests and expanded the college's healthcare curriculum and facilities. She left Hunter College in 1979, and in 1982, she became President of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, remaining until 1990, when she retired. She died in 2012 in Orlando, Florida.  Early life and education  Jean Marie Grennan was born on August 2, 1926, in Sterling, Illinois, United States. The youngest child of Edward and Florence (n√©e Dawson) Grennan, she had two sisters, Sue and Rita, and a brother, Jack, who died as a young adult. She grew up on a 250-acre farm where her parents raised cattle and grew corn and soybeans. Grennan's parents were devout Catholics who impressed on her the value of education. She attended St. Mary's Parochial School and Catholic Community High School in Sterling. She was the first girl in her high school to pursue a general science course rather than study home economics. After graduating, Grennan attended Webster College in Webster Groves, Missouri. She majored in mathematics and graduated cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in June 1948. Rather than applying for a fellowship to attend Radcliffe College as she had considered, she decided to become a nun, later explaining that she wanted \\"to make [my] life productive for as many people as possible.\\" In 1949, she formally entered the Sisters of Loretto, and in December 1950, made her first vows. She took Jacqueline as her religious name, in memory of her brother Jack, who died of a brain tumor at age 21. Her parents were ambivalent about her becoming a nun, but respected her decision. After her first vows, Grennan was sent off to teach in Texas and later Missouri. During the summers, she studied English at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. She graduated in 1957 with a Master of Arts in English. She has been awarded 14 honorary degrees, each from a different college or university.  Early career  After pronouncing her first vows in December 1950, Grennan was sent to teach at Loretto Academy in El Paso, Texas, where she taught mathematics and English for four years. In 1954, she was transferred to teach at Nerinx Hall High School in Missouri, where she taught mathematics, English, and religion. She remained there until 1959, while taking summer classes at the University of Notre Dame. In 1959, Grennan was brought in to Webster College to serve as assistant to President Sr. Francetta Barberis. In 1960, she became Vice President for Development, and in 1962, was made Executive Vice President.  President of Webster College  Grennan became President of Webster College in 1965 when President Barberis accepted a new position in Washington, D.C. As president, she worked to address declining enrollment and to improve academic quality. Recognizing that many Roman Catholic women's colleges were experiencing a downturn in enrollment, she decided to transition Webster to coeducation. Enrollment soon grew significantly. Academics were revamped with innovative curricula including \\"new math,\\" \\"new social studies,\\" and \\"new physics,\\" and improved teacher training with a new Master of Arts in Teaching degree. In addition, Grennan removed the theology course requirements from the curriculum in 1965. In addition to changes in curriculum and enrollment, Grennan commenced an ambitious campaign to improve Webster College's physical plant. She reached out to wealthy institutions, like the National Science Foundation and the Ford Foundation, and individuals like Conrad Hilton for donations. The existing campus was renovated, and new facilities were constructed. In addition, she expanded the primary and secondary education that already existed at the College by initiating a Head Start program, expanding the on-campus elementary school, and establishing the Webster Institute of Mathematics, Science, and Arts, a secondary-level laboratory school. Grennan began a social justice campaign in which students were sent to the poorest St. Louis neighborhoods to volunteer. This initiative attracted the attention of the Kennedy administration, and in 1963, she was appointed to the President's Advisory Panel on Research and Development in Education. In 1965, Johnson administration officials offered her a job as director of an anti-poverty program in St. Louis, which she declined. Though she turned down the position, it was around this time that Grennan realized she did not wish to \\"live as a responsible and productive human being for the rest of [my] life under the vow\\" of obedience as a nun. In 1965, she was appointed to the Steering Committee of Head Start, and was named a member of the Education Task Force for the Peace Corps. In 1967, she was named to the President's Task Force on Urban Educational Opportunities. = Transition to lay ownership = In addition to the many internal changes at Webster College, Grennan had, since 1965, also sought the Vatican's approval to turn the college's ownership from the Sisters of Loretto to a lay board of trustees. In addition to financial concerns and the Sisters' hope to resolve tensions with the Archbishop of St. Louis, Joseph Ritter, Grennan and the Sisters gave three reasons for requesting the change in a 1967 Webster College press release: > It is becoming more and more difficult for a religious order to finance a > college adequately from internal resources... The administration of an > expanding college where lay faculty members constitute seventy-five percent > of the faculty is becoming far too complex to be adequately directed by a > Board of Directors made up exclusively of members of a religious order, > charged with many and diverse responsibilities... We currently lack adequate > and qualified sister-personnel to continue to fill all the administrative > and faculty posts in the college which were formerly filled by sisters. The Vatican did not immediately grant the request, and Grennan engaged in open discourse with Church authorities through public statements, earning her and Webster College a place in national headlines. She said at the time, \\"The very nature of higher education is opposed to juridical control by the Church,\\" but maintained that \\"the Christian grace is translated into every secular institution today. The Holy See finally granted the request in May 1967, and Sister Mary Luke Tobin, the Superior General of the Sisters of Loretto, announced on November 17, 1967 that the transferral of Webster College to independent ownership had been legally concluded. Simultaneously with Webster College's transition, Grennan requested a dispensation from her religious vows. Her given reason was that she had \\"continued to experience a personal conflict between her administrative submission to external juridical control by the Church.\\" She further explained, \\"I have given someone else the authority to limit or veto my decisions.\\" The same year, the Holy See granted her dispensation, though she noted \\"I never ceased being a member of the family.\\" In the 1980s, she became a member of the Loretto Community, the lay branch of the Sisters of Loretto. Because this was the first time a Roman Catholic college or university had ever been removed from Church ownership, and with the additional element of Grennan leaving the Sisters, both she and the college were the subject of much media attention as well as controversy, with one president of a Catholic college describing the move as \\"extremist.\\" Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen, the Catholic televangelist, replied to a reporter asking for his reaction, \\"No comment. I am more interested in Nathan Hales than in Benedict Arnolds.\\" The Brooklyn Tablet, a conservative Catholic newspaper, ran the story under the headline, \\"Webster College Leaves the Church,\\" and a secular news magazine used the title, \\"Another Nun Defects.\\" The media attention surrounding the Webster College controversy propelled Grennan to national prominence. Amidst the reforms of Second Vatican Council, which concluded in 1965, Grennan was a leading proponent of progressive change in the Church. She advocated a greater role for women in the Church, and publicly opposed the Church's ban on contraception. In 1967, she was named a Woman of Accomplishment by Harper's Bazaar. Her story was featured in newspapers such as The New York Times, the Chicago Daily News, The Kansas City Star, The Boston Globe, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, and the Dallas Times Herald, and magazines like The New York Times Magazine, Time, Saturday Review, Life, the Ladies' Home Journal, Look, and Change: The Magazine of Higher Learning. She also made television appearances, joining David Susskind on his show Open End and going on as a guest on The Dick Cavett Show. After leaving the Sisters of Loretto in 1967, Grennan remained President of Webster College until June 1969, when she married Paul J. Wexler.  President of Hunter College  Soon after her marriage, Grennan Wexler moved to New York City, taking the job of Vice President and Director of International University Studies with the Academy for Educational Development. In December 1969, the Board of Higher Education of the City of New York named Grennan to succeed Fritz Joachim Weyl (acting president) as President of Hunter College in Manhattan. She assumed the presidency on January 15, 1970. She was the first female president of the college. Wexler's assumption of the presidency coincided with a turbulent atmosphere at Hunter College. Between May and March 1970, campus unrest grew as students protested over the Vietnam War, racial policies, rising tuition and fees, a new open enrollment policy, and general discontent with the college's administration. That spring, protests repeatedly shut down the campus. Student protesters would block entrances to buildings and occupy elevators and specific floors of buildings. At first, she allowed the protests to continue without bringing in law enforcement. When protests became such an issue that they obstructed the college's operation and after being trapped in her office several times, Wexler called the New York City Police Department to help regain control of the campus. After one instance in which students barricated her in her office and accused her of colluding with \\"pigs,\\" she told The New York Times that her experience being condemned by conservatives when she was at Webster College prepared her for the turmoil at Hunter College. She attested, \\"Zealotry is the enemy. The far right called you every name, from daughter to Beelzebub on, and you learned to take it.\\" After bringing in the police, Wexler cancelled classes and on several occasions, closed down the entire school to restore order. Through negotiations with students and faculty, she was able to restore the college to its normal routine. In response to protests in many City University of New York colleges, the Board of Higher Education ordered the implementation of a new Open Enrollment Policy effective September 1970. This policy increased university- wide enrollment, changed the racial diversity of the student body, and altered the undergraduate curriculum to include courses on African-American studies, Puerto Rican studies, and women's studies. Despite facing opposition from members of the student body, Wexler avidly supported the changes and was instrumental in the policy's implementation. After the rocky beginning to her presidency, Wexler was able to focus on academic improvements, especially focusing on the college's healthcare curriculum. She expanded healthcare training, obtained funding to create a gerontology program in the School of Social Work, and started a women's studies program. In June 1974 she accomplished the incorporation of the Bellevue Hospital School of Nursing into Hunter College's Division of the Schools of Health Professions.[1] In 1978, Wexler became the first woman elected to the board of directors of United Technologies Corporation. She left the presidency of Hunter College in 1979.  Later career  In 1980, Wexler became the first women named a Life Trustee of the University of Pennsylvania. On October 14, 1982, Wexler became President of the National Conference of Christians and Jews. The first female president of the organization, she \\"spoke frequently on interfaith issues in hopes of encouraging mutual respect among religions.\\" She served as president of the NCCJ until 1990, when she retired and moved to Orlando, Florida, with her husband. There, she tutored mathematics in the Orange County Public Schools for several years.  Death and legacy  Wexler died, unexpectedly, in her sleep at her home in Orlando, Florida, on January 19, 2012, aged 85. A funeral Mass was celebrated on January 21 at St. Mary Catholic Church in Sterling, Illinois, and she was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Sterling. Elizabeth Stroble, who was at the time President of Webster University, described upon her death Wexler's \\"charismatic\\" and \\"visionary\\" leadership, saying, \\"The seeds of change that [Jacqueline] planted have transformed Webster into a vastly different institution. The university has grown to become the only Tier One, private, nonprofit university with more than 100 campuses across the United States, Europe and Asia.\\" Wexler's legacy remains through a memorial fund established to the Edward W. Grennan Family Scholarship at Newman Central Catholic High School in Sterling, Illinois.  Personal life  Grennan Wexler married Paul J. Wexler, the president of Orpheum Productions, on June 11, 1969, and adopted his two children, Wendy and Wayne. She remained a devout Catholic throughout her life.

The Nusrat Jahan mosque is the first mosque to be built in Denmark in 1967. This mosque was financed solely by the female members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in Denmark. The capacity of the mosque is 120 people. The mosque is named after Nusrat Jahan Begum, the second wife of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, The Promised Messiah and Mahdi. History The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community and its efforts began in early 1950s. At that time, an Ahmadi Muslim Missionary, Kamal Yousuf was appointed by the Ahmadiyya movement to begin in Denmark. He first toured Denmark in 1956. In 1967, the Community published the first translation of the Quran in Danish. The main translator was Abdus Salam Madsen himself, whose publication was the sole translation available to the Danish public for over four decades. Until the late 1980s, Madsen was seen as the leading public figure of Islam in Denmark. In 1966, roughly five days prior to construction, the Hvidovre Municipality revoked its initial permission to construct the mosque. On the other hand, the third caliph of the Community, Mirza Nasir Ahmad was due to arrive in the region, to lay its foundation. The mosque‚Äôs architect, John Zachariassen, reported the situation to the then Prime Minister of Denmark, Jens Otto Krag. Krag gave a notice to ignore the municipal decision and to continue with the construction work. The foundation stone was finally laid on May 6, 1966 and the mosque, the construction of which gained widespread media attention, was inaugurated a year later by the caliph on July 21, 1967. The opening ceremony was attended by representatives of the Danish government.

It is one of two Hessian nature parks in the Taunus and the second largest nature park in Hesse.  Location  The Taunus Nature Park stretches across the counties of Hochtaunuskreis, Lahn-Dill-Kreis, Limburg-Weilburg, Main- Taunus-Kreis, Wetteraukreis and Gie√üen. Its boundaries are identical with these counties except that, in the west, it is bounded by the A3 motorway, in the north roughly by the Lahn valley (but extends between Runkel and Weilburg over the Lahn into the Westerwald) and in the east by the A5 motorway. In the south it ends where the Main-Taunus Foreland between Frankfurt am Main and Wiesbaden begins. The park borders in the west on the Rhine-Taunus Nature Park. The nature park covers the eastern half of the natural region of the High Taunus. This is where the main ridge of the Taunus runs with the highest peak in the range, the Gro√üer Feldberg (881.5 m). Also part of the park and north of this ridge is the much larger Eastern Hintertaunus. Another part of the park is the Anterior Taunus, a narrow strip south of the ridge that descends to the Rhine-Main Plain. The original name of the park, \\"High Taunus\\", was thus not really accurate.  Fauna  The High Taunus is sparsely settled and densely covered by coniferous forest. In the Eastern Hintertaunus, deciduous woods dominate. Characteristic of the Taunus with its rolling to high mountain relief are extensive scattered orchards, which occur mainly in the Anterior Taunus and on the eastern slopes facing the Wetterau.

Hart Norris a New York investor who, in 1873, purchased over 3000 acres in the area. Norris had intended to name the town ‚ÄúElm City‚Äù but, as the elms died, he was convinced by others to name it after himself. By the early 1880s Norris consisted of a hardware store, creamery, blacksmith shop, hotel, livery stable, drug, merchandise and furniture stores, a real estate office and several homes. A school was located near the south edge of the city. The Logan Valley post office, established in 1874, had its post office name changed to Norris October 3, 1881. The Norris post office was closed 27-OCT-1887 and moved to Coleridge, NE.Perkey, Elton A. 2003. Perkey's Nebraska Place-Names. 4th Ed. Nebraska State Historical Society. Lincoln, NE. Neither Logan Valley nor Norris survived. Mr. Norris and the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha Railway failed to reach agreement for a right of way through his town in 1883. Thus, the railroad was built two miles west of Norris, and lots began selling in what would become the town of Coleridge, approximately 3 miles west and 1 mile north of Norris. By early 1885 many of Norris's businesses had moved to Coleridge. A Cedar County Plat Map (2) showed Norris still having 16 lots at its original location in 1899. The Norris School (District 30), organized March 16, 1880, was dissolved and merged with Coleridge District 41 in 1959. The Norris Cemetery is located one mile east and ¬æ mile north of the former city of Norris.

Patok-Fushe Kuqe-Ishem Nature Reserve Created during the Holocene period, this area was characterized by a geo- morphologic dynamism. Its development spanned four phases, which correspond to the formation of four lagoons, separated by littoral cordons. The fourth lagoon is the current one. A fifth lagoon (the current outer lagoon) is in an active formation process, also influenced by a rapid development of the littoral cordon in the western part. The whole area is flat and characterized by an intensive tectonic process and numerous underground water bodies. During the second half of the twentieth century, human activities played an important role in the changes of this ecosystem through activities such as drainage, dam construction and deforestation. The area's physical and geographical characteristics are the main basis for its development potential. It has a relatively mild winter and fresh summer. The sun shines for an average of 2,479 hours per year. The average annual temperature is 15.5 ¬∞C, and average annual rainfall is .  Biodiversity  Flora in Patoku Lagoon The physical characteristics and habitat diversity of the lagoon are closely related to the biodiversity of the wetland complex. The most common marine plants are the underwater meadows of fucus virsoides and posidonia oceanica. The vegetation is mainly characterized by microalgae, driven by nitrogen and phosphorus availability. One indicator of this condition is the large amount of diatoms. The macrophages of the lagoon belong to chlorophyta and pheophyta. The grasslands of phanerogams cover about 40% of the lagoon. They are mainly zostera noltei, but in the shallow waters ruppia spiralis is found. This phytocoenosis has an important role in the lagoon. Patoku Lagoon part of the protected areas near Shengjin and Lezhe The hygroscopic and hydrophilic vegetation covers a considerable area of the lagoon's peripheral parts. They are dominated by the three main associations of Phragmites, Typha and Scirpus. Halophilous vegetation is most common in the northern and southern parts. This vegetation belongs to several associations, of which the most important are those with Arthrocnemum and Juncus. The vegetation of the dunes is mainly found in the western part, with diverse species. The shores of the lagoon are dominated by Tamarix, Konopica Vitex and Rubus berries. Along the coastline of the lagoon The invertebrate fauna of the lagoon and its catchment basin‚Äîincluding surrounding freshwater bodies, canals, marshes, estuaries and shores‚Äîare characterized by a variety of groups and species, from molluscs to mammals to crabs and insects. Many fish species are of economic interest. Amphibians and reptiles are found more in forests, swamps and canyons around the lagoon. Many Caretta water turtles live on the shore near the lagoon and the green turtle Chelonia mydas is also present.

He was the son of Hindu water deity Varuna and his wife Parnasa. Kalinga is mentioned to have joined the Kaurava camp in the epic war. The story of Srutayudha in the Mahabharata says that his mother had wished for a boon from Varuna for his son so that he could not be slayed by anyone in battle. Varuna had presented a magical mace to Srutayudha by using which he would stay undefeated in battle. Varuna had also warned about the adverse effects of the magical Mace if it was used against an unarmed opponent. According to the warning, the Mace would strike back Srutyudha himself if he used it against any unarmed person. Srutyudha stood in the front of the Akshauhini of soldiers in the Kaurava side along with Sakuni, Salya, Jayadratha, two princes of Avanti named Vinda and Anuvinda, and the Kekaya brothers, and Sudakshina the ruler of the Kamvojas, Jayatsena, Vrihadvala, Kritavarman . The Mahabharata describes these selected warriors as the tigers in men  The Mace Used in the Battle by Srutayudha  As per the narration in the epic of Mahbharata, Srutayudha challenged Arjuna in the battlefield while he marched on his chariot into the lines of the Kamboja army division and targeted Kritavarman. Srutayudha stuck Arjuna and Krishna with multiple arrows and injured them in the height of the battle. Arjuna fired back arrows at him and then cut off Srutayudha's bow and then his quiver and then struck him on the chest. Arjuna then killed Srutayudha's steeds and charioteer incapacitating his movement on the chariot in the battle. Srutayudha filled with wrath rushed at Arjuna with his magical mace and hurled the mace at Krishna who was an unarmed participant in the battle as the charioteer of Arjuna. As per the conditions described by Varuna earlier while gifting the Mace to him, it didn't harm the unarmed Krishna but boomeranged back on Srutyudha killing him.

Although the text states that it is referring to Goths per se, several features mark the Germanic words as Vandalic, and it is likely that the text simply uses the term 'Gothic' loosely: correspondingly, Procopius refers to the Goths, Vandals, Visigoths, and Gepids as \\"Gothic nations\\" and opines that they \\"are all of the Arian faith, and have one language called Gothic\\".Procopius of Caesarea, THE VANDALIC WAR I,2-8Greule, Albrecht and Matthias Springer.

Paul Kane, an important early Canadian artist, purchased the property in 1853 and built a cottage on the site. On May 29, 1855, a fire broke out in Kane's stables, and spread to neighbouring structures. He and his heirs later expanded the cottage, and clad it in brick. His family owned the property until 1903, after which it served a variety of purposes. It was acquired by a church for the deaf, who constructed a larger structure in front of the house. When a developer demolished the church in the 1970s, it exposed the heritage house, triggering a grass-roots effort to save the house from demolition. The house was bought by the city in 1978 and subsequently designated a heritage structure under the Ontario Heritage Act. In 1984, the Toronto Star published an article about the building, illustrated by photos showing it boarded up, quoting neighbours calling for it to be demolished. In 1985, an architect incorporated the house into a new housing cooperative being built on Isabella Street, the street just north of Wellesley. The design only integrated the sound portions of the house, the rear of the original house being damaged by fire. The city created a small parkette, at 56 Wellesley Street East in what was once Kane's front yard.

It is named after the Altos de Pica region. This segment is long and extends between the volcanoes Isluga in the north and Irruputuncu in the south. Volcanoes in the gap are old, Miocene to Pliocene in age and are heavily eroded. Examples include , Cerro Cariquima and Cerro Tatjachura. At the latitude of the Pica gap, an underwater rise known as the Iquique rise is subducted in the Peru-Chile Trench. It is unclear if the subduction of this rise is the cause for the lack of recent volcanism in the Pica gap. Geologically, the Pica gap lies between two crustal domains which are defined by their divergent lead isotope ratios, the northerly Arequipa-Antofalla block of Proterozoic age and the southern Chilenia terrane of Paleozoic age. Other phenomena which coincide with the Pica gap are the absence of tectonic horsts west of the Andes, an area where a zone of high electrical conductivity in the deep crust beneath the forearc does not extend to the actual volcanic arc (and thus may reflect the absence of molten magma), a symmetry plane of the Andes, the Salar de Uyuni basin behind the arc and the location of the actual bend in the Andes that is usually placed at the Arica Bend. These phenomena may be unrelated to the Pica gap, however. The Cerro Porquesa lava dome and ignimbrite are the only volcanic centres with late Pleistocene activity in the area. Some evidence of recent volcanic activity exists at the Pliocene volcano Sillajuhay, where geothermal activity and deformation of the ground were observed.

The novel takes place in Turin in the 1960s and it is written in form of a diary, similarly to La suora giovane, one of the most famous works of the author‚Äôs. Literary critic Lorenzo Mondo saw in this novel a representation of madness similar to the one described by Louis Stevenson in The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mister Hyde. Plot Tino is an orphan living in a boarding house. A few days before turning seventeen he goes back to his hometown, Turin, to prepare for his graduation exam, and he is hosted by Aunt Galla and Uncle Serafino Calandra in their big house situated at the foot of a hill. Uncle Serafino‚Äôs twin brother, called ‚ÄúThe Professor‚Äù, also lives in the house. He used to work in Africa, before becoming crazy and being locked in the attic of his brother‚Äôs house, where he spends his time recording insects and details of his room with a camera. No one has ever seen him, except for Uncle Serafino, who takes care of him, feeds him, washes him and pays a prostitute, Iris, to entertain him. When Serafino goes out he takes the key of the attic with him, so nobody can disturb the Professor, but Aunt Galla and the maid Annetta, peek at the mysterious twin through the door lock. After a while, Tino finds out that Uncle Serafino had been fired a very long time ago and lied to Aunt Galla pretending to go to work every morning since then, and also that he had spent gambling all of the money saved for Tino‚Äôs studies. Tino spends a night with the uncle in a gambling house and meets the Duke, an old friend of the uncle‚Äôs and a croupier of the house. The next day the Duke takes Serafino home, because he had been sick the night before. Aunt Galla takes the keys of the attic to feed the Professor and gets in with Tino and Annetta. There they find out that Iris had been kidnapped by Uncle Serafino and that the Professor has never existed: each time Serafino pretended to go to work, he locked himself in the attic and faked being his twin brother.

After finishing unplaced on her only start as a two-year-old in 1993 she emerged as a top-class middle-distance filly in the following year, winning the Cheshire Oaks, Ribblesdale Stakes and Irish Oaks. She finished unplaced in her last two races and was retired from racing at the end of the season with a record of three wins in six starts. She was not successful as a broodmare, producing ony a few minor winners. Background Bolas was a brown mare with a small white star bred in England by her owner Khalid Abdullah's Juddmonte Farms. During her racing career she was trained at Lambourn in Berkshire by Barry Hills and was ridden in all of her races by Pat Eddery. Her sire, Unfuwain was a high-class middle-distance runner who won four Group races before siring the winners of more than five hundred winners at stud. He was particularly successful with fillies: his daughters included Lahan, Petrushka, Eswarah, Lailani and Zahrat Dubai. Bolas's dam Three Stars showed some ability as a racehorse, winning two minor races from four starts as a three-year-old in 1985. Three Stars was a great-granddaughter of the influential broodmare Felucca, whose other descendants included Cut Above, Sharp Edge, Longboat, Bireme, Indigenous and Fenomeno. Racing career =1993: two-year-old season= Bolas made her debut when she was one of twenty-eight juvenile colts and fillies to contest the Westley Maiden Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on 30 September. She started at odds of 9/1 and finished eighteenth behind the colt Darnay after fading in the second half of the race. =1994: three-year-old season= On her first appearance as a three-year-old Bolas contested the Listed Cheshire Oaks (a trial race for The Oaks) over one mile three and a half furlongsat Chester Racecourse on 4 May. She was made the 5/1 third choice behind the May Hill Stakes winner Hawajiss and State Crystal in an eight-runner field. Bolas took the lead before half way and kept on well when challenged in the straight to win by one and three quarter lengths from State Crystal with seven lengths back to Hawajiss in third. The filly had never been entered in the Eprom Oaks but at Royal Ascot in June she was stepped up in class for the Group 2 Ribblesdale Stakes. In a nine-runner field she was made the 3/1 favourite ahead of Spot Prize (second in the Musidora Stakes), Munnaya (Lingfield Oaks Trial) and Gothic Dream. Bolas took the lead a after a furlong and was never seriously challenged, winning by five lengths and three quarters of a length from Gothic Dream and Pearl Kite. On 9 July Bolas was sent to Ireland and moved up to Group 1 class for the Irish Oaks on soft ground at the Curragh Racecourse. She was made the 5/2 favourite ahead of the Epsom Oaks runner-up Wind In Her Hair who was trained by Barry Hills' son John and ridden by another of his sons Richard. Hawajiss and Gothic Dream where again in opposition, while the other six runners included Bulaxie (Fred Darling Stakes, Lupe Stakes) as well as the French challengers Her Ladyship (second in the Prix de Diane) and Bonash (Prix de Malleret). In another front-running performance, Bolas took the lead from the start and was never headed, keeping on well in the straight to come home two lengths clear of Hawajiss with Gothic Dream in third. After three consecutive victories against her own generation Bolas was matched against older fillies and mares in the Yorkshire Oaks on 17 August and started 6/5 favourite in a seven-runner field. She attempted to make all the running but was overtaken three furlongs from the finish and was eased down by Eddery to finish fifth, more than ten lengths behind the five- year-old winner Only Royale. After a break of two and a half months Bolas ended her racing career with a trip to the United States to contest the Breeders' Cup Turf at Churchill Downs on 5 November. She started at odds of 9.5/1 but after racing in second place she dropped away in the last half mile and finished tailed-off behind Tikkanen. Breeding record After her retirement from racing Bolas became a broodmare for Juddmonte. In November 2005 she was put up for auction at Tattersalls and was bought for 13,000 guineas by Seamus Kennedy. She produced fifteen foals and four minor winners between 1996 and 2013: *Twice, a bay colt (later gelded), foaled in 1996, sired by Rainbow Quest.

Freixas has released a sampler, six albums, and a series of covers of international singer- songwriters as a contribution to the revitalization of the Protest song in the Catalan-speaking countries. Biography Freixas started performing as a member of a Sant Sadurn√≠ d'Anoia based band called Pangea. They did mainly rock-song covers. His first solo performance took place in January 2004 in Igualada. In April 2004, he performed alone for the second time and used the live recordings for the sampler. Freixas' first album appeared a year later, in 2005: Set voltes rebel (Bullanga Records) (Seven Times a Rebel). In 2005, together with members of the fairly well-known band called Inadaptats, Freixas created and performed a show to pay homage to the Valencian singer-songwriter Ovidi Montllor. In 2006, Freixas uploaded a set of covers of international singer-songwriters including Silvio Rodr√≠guez, V√≠ctor Jara, Ovidi Montllor, Raimon, and Bob Marley, under the name of Les veus dels pobles lliures (The Voices of the Free Peoples). The next two albums have a slightly more modern sound and include some pop-rock songs with a touch of electronic music: El cam√≠ cap a nosaltres (The Path Towards Us) (RGB Suports, 2007), and La m√† dels qui t'esperen (The Hand of those who await you) (Temps Record, 2009). The fourth album, Tocats pel foc (Touched by the fire) (Temps Record) appeared in 2012. It features a more live-like sound, with a significant presence of Acoustic guitars. Freixas described it as a homage to Manuel de Pedrolo. In November 2013, Freixas published his first book: Paraules per a Gaeta (Words for Gaeta), thanks to the Publishing Cooperative Tigre de Paper. Protesta, the fifth album appeared in May 2014: under two formats: a CD with unedited material and also a DVD of the concert marking a decade of performances. The concert had taken place just after the death of Freixas' father. Freixas has so far performed over 1500 times. In 2015, he was awarded the Catalan Album of the Year Prize by the Radio Station R√†dio 4, as well as gaining popular recognition; he has won several Enderrock Awards including for Best DVD/Documentary. The sixth of Freixas' albums, Proposta, was launched in 2017 when Freixas became a father. In 2019 Freixas is presenting his seventh album: Festa Major. Cesk Freixas has also contributed to several albums either cooperative or by other artists, such as Projecte Mut's 10 anys i bons, #paualpalau by Pau Alabajos, or En les nostres mans, by Andreu Valor. Political and cultural activities Cesk Freixas is a member of two political organizations within the Catalan National Left: Candidatura d'Unitat Popular and Coordinadora Obrera Sindical. Cesk Freixas has also expressed his support to Palestinian activists, the Catalan culture and language, and tackling poverty among others. His political engagement might explain why his concerts have attracted political criticism and allegedly boycott by Spanish Nationalists and Conservatives. In 2009, the Spanish Conservative Party and a Spanish Nationalist Party unsuccessfully tried to have his concert in Figueres cancelled. Since 2005, he has worked in the production and organization of the Trobada de Cantautors dels Pa√Øsos Catalans, a Gathering or Meeting of Singer- songwriters from all over the Catalan-speaking Countries. Artists such as Quico Pi de la Serra, Jaume Arnella, Miquel Gil, Albert Fibla, Feliu Ventura, and Pau Alabajos have taken part. In the elections to the Catalan Parliament Freixas has held symbolic responsibilities under the candidacy of CUP in 2012 and 2015. He has also contested or given active support to CUP in Local elections. Since June 2016, Freixas has also appeared regularly in Catalunya R√†dio and is very active online.

Built in 1899, it is a good local example of Beaux Arts architecture, and its construction exemplified the transition of Pratt Street from a residential to commercial area. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 11, 1982. Description and history The Dillon Building is located roughly midway between Trumbull and Main Streets on the south side of Pratt Street. It is a five-story masonry building, built with brick load-bearing walls, limestone trim, and a wooden frame. It shares party walls with a taller building on the right, and a shorter one on the left. Its front facade is four bays wide, with a single store front flanked by recessed entrances on either side, one providing entry to the store, and the other to the upstairs. The second floor windows are articulated by cast iron pilasters finished to resemble stone, and an entablature and band of dentil stonework separate it from the upper floors. The upper floors are articulate by full-height pilasters, which rise to elaborate brackets at the cornice. Windows on the third and fourth floors are rectangular, while the top floor windows are set in segmental arch openings. Prior to construction of this building, the lot on which it stands was occupied by one half of a two-story brick residential duplex, probably built in the 1840s. Commercial growth in the city during the second half of the 19th century placed development pressure on residential streets like Pratt Street that abutted Main Street. Charles Dillon, a Main Street merchant and milliner, purchased the west side of the duplex in 1898. When the building was completed the following year, it and the neighboring half-duplex epitomized the transition of the street from a residential to commercial area. The probable architect of the building was Isaac A. Allen Jr., who had previously done work for Dillon, and worked in a practice that had previously designed buildings with a similar upper floor plan.

University of Washington In 1972, a group of students on the campus of the University of Washington started a theatre group called the Theatrical Ensemble of Asians. It was founded by a teacher named Stanley Asis in the school‚Äôs Ethnic Cultural Center, with its original members including students of Asian and Hispanic descent.Lee, Esther. A History of Asian American Theatre. Cambridge University Press, 2006. Even in its humble beginnings, the theatre gave students an opportunity to explore their heritage and perform plays written by other Asian Americans; those who were not Asian American had an opportunity to be involved in a diverse group and celebrate other‚Äôs culture.

On 3 June 1967, the penultimate game of the first half of the season was played between Maslahat Naqil Al-Rukab and Al-Firqa Al-Thalitha, and the latter side were set to then play the last remaining match from the first half of the season against Aliyat Al-Shorta later that week. But after the outbreak of the Six-Day War on 5 June, the league was postponed for over a month. In late July, the Iraq Central Football Association (IFA) announced that all remaining matches for the season were cancelled. However, the IFA later came to a new decision and decided to complete the first half of the season by holding its last game between Aliyat Al-Shorta and Al-Firqa Al- Thalitha on the evening of 21 August at Al-Shaab Stadium. As Aliyat Al-Shorta led the standings after each team had played each other once, they were named as the league's winners. This was Aliyat Al-Shorta's first league title and the second title in the history of Al-Shorta. Shidrak Yousif was named best player while Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya's Hisham Atta and Maslahat Naqil Al-Rukab's Adel Ibrahim were joint-top scorers with five goals each.

Bejan is an American political theorist and author. She is Associate Professor of Political Theory in the Department of Politics and International Relations at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of Oriel College. She received her PhD with distinction from Yale University in 2013 and was the recipient of the American Political Science Association's 2015 Leo Strauss Award for the best doctoral dissertation in political philosophy. She holds degrees from the University of Chicago and University of Cambridge. Her 2017 book Mere Civility: Disagreement and the Limits of Toleration examines contemporary handling of civility, disagreement and freedom of speech in the light of arguments by the 17th-century thinkers Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and Roger Williams, founder of Providence Plantation, Rhode Island. She argues in Mere Civility that Roger Williams' approach of open disagreement with, and even expression of contempt for, opponents is a stronger basis for a liberal and inclusive society than the approaches of Hobbes or Locke, on the grounds that both Hobbes and Locke see a role for suppression and exclusion in building a tolerant society. Bejan gave the Balzan-Skinner lecture at the University of Cambridge on 22 April 2016, entitled Acknowledging Equality, in which she questioned modern conceptions of equality through examining 'ideas of equality as a political principle, a religious commitment, and a social practice in seventeenth-century England.' In the aftermath of Donald J. Trump's election as 45th President of the United States, Bejan argued against the use of calls for civility by both Trump's supporters and opponents as a way to silence those who disagree with them.

For information on the early stages of Utopia Station see the e-flux project site: http://projects.e-flux.com/utopia/index.html . The first Utopia Station exhibition took place as part of the Venice Biennale in 2003, and later traveled to the Haus der Kunst in Munich, with additions and modifications, in 2004. =The Pragmatism in the History of Art= In Pragmatism, the first of Nesbit's Pre-Occupations series of essay compilations, Nesbit outlines the questions modern art historians address to make sense of the changes in art and life during the early 20th century. Through a pragmatic study of the societal changes of this time period, Nesbit attempts to understand the break towards abstraction, best characterized by artists Pablo Picasso and George Braque with the rise of Cubism, in which Nesbit interprets the Cubist line as an \\"embrace of the language of industry.\\" She asserts that it was the introduction of rationalized methods of drawing into the French school curriculum by arts administrators Eug√®ne Guillaume and Antonin Proust in 1881 that led to the break between representational and abstract art. She explores these inquiries by studying the writings of art historians Meyer Schapiro, Henri Focillon, George Kubler, Robert Herbert, T. J. Clark, and Linda Nochlin, the philosophies of Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze, and the films of Chris Marker and Jean-Luc Godard. Artists discussed include Vincent van Gogh, Isamu Noguchi, Lawrence Weiner, and Gordon Matta- Clark, among others. =Midnight: The Tempest Essays: Pre-Occupations 2= In Midnight, the second of Nesbit's \\"Pre-Occupations\\" series of essay compilations, Nesbit returns the question of pragmatism to the everyday critical practice of the art historian, illustrated with case studies on Eug√®ne Atget, Marcel Duchamp, Jean-Luc Godard, Cindy Sherman, Louise Lawler, Rachel Whiteread, Gabriel Orozco, Rirkrit Tiravanija, Lawrence Weiner, Nancy Spero, Rem Koolhaas, Martha Rosler, Gerhard Richter, Mathew Barney, and Richard Serra, among others, in a continuity of investigation. The essays were originally published between 1986 and the early 2000s, and reflect Nesbit's interest in \\"the genealogy of ideas\\". In an interview with Hyperallergic, Nesbit describes her approach to thinking as being based in the \\"set of theoretical developments that took place in art history in Europe and the United States in the 1970s and 1980s.\\" Put simply, Nesbit believes that art historians can and should make use of philosophical questions as starting points in the quest to better understand the time and the place of the work of art.

The Naha Stone is a large volcanic rock located in Hilo, Hawaii. The stone was used in the cultural traditions of Native Hawaiians, and many legends surround it.  Origin  The Naha Stone originated from Mount Waialeale on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. It was found on the banks of the Wailua river before being moved via a double canoe to Hilo, where it became a symbol of the Naha Clan. The stone was used to prove the legitimacy of the bloodline of any claiming to be of the Naha Clan. When a boy was born, he was placed on top of the slab of rock. If he remained silent, he was considered to be one of the members of the Naha. If he cried out, he would be cast out. The Naha Stone was considered sacred, and only members of the Naha Clan were permitted to move it. A legend existed that if one were to overturn the stone, that man would be granted the power to unify all of Hawaii. King Kamehameha, the eventual conqueror of the Hawaiian Islands, was said to have been influenced by this legend. Some sources state that he was able to move the stone at the age of 14, after a series of failed attempts.Desha, Frazier. pp. 188 Informative sign detailing the moving of the Naha Stone.

Active during the Golden Age of Piracy, he is best known for sailing alongside Thomas Tew to join Henry Every in the Indian Ocean, hunting the Moghul treasure fleet.  History  In 1694 a number of Rhode Island pirate vessels prepared to take to sea, ostensibly for privateering. Among them were Tew (preparing for his second voyage), Joseph Faro, William Mays, Richard Want, and Thomas Wake in his 100-ton, 10-gun, 70-man barque Susanna (sometimes Susannah or Susana), which had been fitted out in Boston. Wake had already accepted King James's general amnesty for pirates and had been granted a privateering commission from the governor. Wake may have set sail from Rhode Island alongside pirate trader Tempest Rogers, who would later be accused of trading in William Kidd's looted East India goods. After a time at sea Wake, Tew, and the other three captains met with Henry Every's ship Fancy and awaited the treasure fleet. Most of the fleet slipped past in the night but two were straggling (including the massive and heavily laden Gunsway) and the pirates gave chase. Except for Faro's Portsmouth Adventure, the smaller ships couldn't keep pace with Every's 46-gun Man-Of-War and were unable to join the fight. As a consequence Wake and his crew received no shares of the enormous treasure haul. Wake and the Susanna visited Adam Baldridge's pirate trading post on Madagascar in 1695 (Baldridge called him \\"Thomas Weak\\"). They careened the ship there and did some trading, but most of the crew took sick, and in April 1696 Wake, the ship's master, and many of the crew died of illness. William Kidd had been granted a commission in 1695 to hunt a number of named pirates, Thomas Wake among them; Kidd instead turned to piracy himself, but Wake died before they met. The remaining crew took the Susanna to Saint Augustine and joined with Captain Hore (John Hoar) on the pirate ship John and Rebecca. The Susanna's ill luck followed them: when Hoar and his crew called at Baldridge's settlement in 1697 to consider retiring, the Malagasay natives began an uprising, and a number of pirates with their captains - including Hoar and many of his crew (some formerly Wake's) - were killed.

The building was constructed in the 18th and 19th centuries, but was completely rebuilt in 2013, raising its height from two stories to four. History Vasily Vladimirovich Grushetsky (1743 - 1813) bought the land in 1774 and built much of the house over the next few years. He was an officer of the Semenov Life Guards regiment and fought in the Russian-Turkish war of 1768 -1774. He was an in-law and subordinate of Prince Vasily Dolgorukov famous for his conquest of the Crimea. Grushetsky fought in the assault of Perekop and the battle of Alushta. The house later belonged to his daughter P. V. Muraveva-Apostol, who sold the house in 1816 to Prince Nikolai Sergeyevich Volkonsky. Volkonsky was the maternal grandfather of Leo Tolstoy, and is believed to be the prototype of Prince Bolkonsky in War and Peace. The novel refers to \\"an old, gloomy house on Vozdvizhenka\\", where some of the scenes of the novel occur. From the 1830s the mansion belonged to the Rumin family, who were nobility from Ryazan. Tolstoy visited the Ryumins and met P. S. Scherbatovaya in the house. She was the prototype of Kitty Scherbatskaya in his 1878 novel Anna Karenina. In the early twentieth century the mansion was owned by Shamsi Asadulaev, an oilman from Baku, Azerbaijan. In Soviet times, the building was occupied by several organizations, including the People's Commissariat for Naval Affairs, the editorial offices of \\"Peasant Newspaper\\" and \\"History of the Civil War\\" and others. Later, the house belonged to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is now privately owned. The modern look of the house was formed in the reconstructions at the turn of 20th century and in the 2010s. The north facade facing Vozdvizhenka Street was rebuilt in 1897 by architect K. Terek, and the facade facing Holy Cross Lane and the dome on the corner of the house were added by P. Zarutsky in 1907. Before 2009, the house was identified by a plaque as an object of cultural heritage. In 2013, despite numerous objections by politicians and cultural figures, the building was reconstructed, increasing the height from 2 to 4 stories, and rebuilding the dome. Current ownership The building, according to Reuters, is owned by the Centre for the Development of Inter-personal Communications (CDIC), which is controlled by Lyudmila Putina, the former wife of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The CDIC's offices are in the building, but it is mainly occupied by commercial tenants, including VTB Bank, Sberbank, Severstroygroup - a construction company, a sushi restaurant and a Burger King. Total rent from the building is about $3-$4 million. Tenants pay their rent to a company known as Meridian, which is in turn owned by a company known as Intererservis, which is wholly owned by Lyudmila Alexandrovna Shkrebnyova, which is Putina's maiden name. Putina's sister, Olga Alexandrovna Tsomayeva, was previously General Director of Intererservis. Artur Ocheretny, Putina's current husband, chairs the CDIC's management board.

Biography There is conflicting evidence as to Fischer's early years. MuseumArt, while giving the date of birth as 1859, elsewhere suggests that it might have been 1847, and cites the Saratov Governorate Imperial archives, according to which he owned a photography salon in Saratov in as early as 1863-1868, the official permission having been granted (\\"...to Karl Fischer, the citizen of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach\\") personally by the Governor Grigory Aksakov (the son of writer Sergey Aksakov). In 1877 he founded a photographic salon in Orenburg, and in mid-1880s moved to Moscow to buy there in 1887 a house which would later become the famous Fischer Atelier. Fischer's vast artistic legacy includes series of portraits of Russian actors (among them Maria Ermolova, Ivan Moskvin, Vsevolod Meyerkhold), writers (Leo Tolstoy, Leonid Andreyev, Anton Chekhov) artists (Ilya Repin, Vasily Surikov, Mikhail Vrubel) and composers (Pyotr Tchaikovsky, Sergey Rakhmaninov). An official Imperial Theatres photographer in 1892-1915, he documented several major productions at the Alexandrinka, Maly Theatre and Moscow Art Theatre. In 1894 he became a co-founder of the Russian Photographic Society and served as its Chairman in 1898‚Äî1907. The famous Fischer Atelier at the Kuznetsky Bridge (1895-1915) in Moscow specialized also in architectural and historical photography which featured regularly in the magazines like Niva and Vsemirnaya Illustratsiya. Fischer, who was closely associated with the Tretyakov Gallery, was the first in Russia to publish illustarted catalogues of paintings, among his best-known being The 25th Anniversary of the Peredvizhniki Group, 1872‚Äî1897 and the Tretyakov Gallery Catalogue (both 1899). After the death of Leo Tolstoy in 1910 Fischer, responding to the request of the writer's widow, published several albums which collected practically every single photograph of Tolstoy made in his lifetime, and featured also portraits of his family members and many of his friends.Carl Fischer at the Museum Art site In 1915, at the height of the jingoistic anti-German campaign in Russia, Fischer (then still a citizen of Prussia) was stripped of his Imperial honours. The Fischer Atelier was destroyed by the mob as a result of anti-German pogrom and never re-opened. That year he applied for Russian citizenship and apparently received it, but when exactly, remains uncertain. Fischer continued to work as a photographer in the Soviet Russia after 1917. It is known that in 1923 he handed all his photographs of Alexander Ostrovsky to Anna Golubkina, for her to use them in her work on the monument which years later would be placed by the Maly Theatre.

In 1983 Ord's parents were forced to claim bankruptcy and due to a poor business dealing by his father. Ord focused on self-development through Martial Arts. He graduated from Annapolis Sr. High School in 1987 and attended Anne Arundel County Community College and received an associate degree in 1990. Ord attended the University of South Carolina in 1990 to 1993 and obtained an MBA from Templeton University in 1999. Ord studied martial arts from the age of 4 and by 15 had obtained a black belt in Jujitsu and Karate. He continued to study all martial arts and was eventually honored into the International Martial Art Hall of Fame in 2000. It was Ord's Martial Art dedication that molded his career into Law Enforcement and Security. Currently, Ord is considered one of the world's top defensive tactics instructors and he has developed training programs for the US Army and The US State Department.  Career  In 1995 Ord was promoted as Deputy Director of the United States Police Defensive Tactics Association and developed training courses for Law Enforcement organizations around the world. During this time frame, Ord also graduated from the South West Florida Criminal Justice Academy in 2000 and was a Deputy Sheriff for a Florida Sheriffs Department. Ord moved to Culpeper, Virginia and became a Deputy Sheriff with the Culpeper County Sheriffs Department. In 2003 Ord founded the Virginia Security company Falken Industries with under $600.00 . He was divorced, living his parents basement and was committed to restarting his life. By 2017 Ord had made over 10 million dollars with his company. Ord provided private law enforcement officers under the Virginia Statute affording Private Security Law Enforcement Power and the tile ‚ÄúPolice‚Äù. His authority and experience of private police, Police training and Sheriffs office training have been called to examine the VA code on the special powers of the Special Conservator of the Peace, or SCOP.

No. 08-7094.Decided: December 4, 2009 Attorney The amicus curiae lawyers, Alan Gura of Gura & Possessky and Art Spitzer of the ACLU National Capital Area, say the D.C. Circuit has adopted too narrow a standard to prove standing, effectively limiting access to the courts. Attorney Gura had become famous for another firearms case decided in the US Supreme court. District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008), is a landmark case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held in a 5‚Äì4 decision that the Second Amendment protects an individual's right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. Ord's original case was dismissed and upon appeal the U.S. District court found that Ord had sufficient cause to pursue his case.\\"this circuit has offered a wary allegiance to the imminence standard, first articulated in Navegar, Inc. v. United States, 103 F.3d 994, 998 (D.C.Cir.1997). Today's opinion labors to extend that line of cases, barring preenforcement claims for declaratory relief unless the plaintiff can show a threat of imminent prosecution, and thus denying access to Article III courts to District of Columbia litigants seeking vindication of civil rights claims-access they would have under applicable Supreme Court precedent. Whether Ord's allegations meet Navegar's stringent standard is a close question, but this controversy demonstrates why litigants should not be required to jump through such hoops to get past the courthouse door. Consequently, while I agree Ord has standing to bring his claim for damages under 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 198\\" His case was supported by the ACLU and The Second Amendment Foundation.

Ord later lost this contract due to an employee who subversively stole the contract and was sued by Ord. In December 2015, Ord was called as a subject matter expert of Police and Defensive tactics for the Washington Post. The article and its contents later won a Pulitzer prize.

Her biological mother was a young single Saulteaux/M√©tis/Cree woman whose parents and grandparents, as well as Hubbard's Cree/Nakota father, were placed into the Canadian Indian residential school system. With limited support from family and social services, Hubbard's mother gave her to a social worker whom she trusted, putting her up for adoption through the Saskatchewan Adopt Indian Metis (AIM) pilot project, part of the Sixties Scoop. Raised on a farm near Avonlea, Saskatchewan, Hubbard's adoptive parents were supportive of her search; it was her adoptive mother who first asked Hubbard, at the age of 14, if she wanted to find her biological family. Their search yielded nothing for almost two years until they hired a Cree lawyer who located Hubbard's birth mother in just two weeks; a woman who turned out to be a friend of her biological father. She met her birth mother three days after her sixteenth birthday, followed by her father, three weeks later. She would go on to reunite with all ten of her siblings, the last, a sister, at the age of twenty-two.

Published in 1942, it was her first book. It is an unconventional work, tracing the journey of a highly politicized young Catholic college graduate through various stages of emotional development, in unusually frank and revealing detail. The story blends many themes that had clearly marked the author‚Äôs own life, such as patriarchy, feminism, rebellion and betrayal, as reflected in her later autobiography. The six episodes do not follow directly in sequence, and some had already appeared as magazine fiction. Critics noted that some of the characters are easily recognizable portraits from the contemporary New York literary scene. Background =Autobiographical elements= The Company She Keeps‚Äô protagonist, Margaret Sargent, closely resembles McCarthy‚Äôs account of herself in her later autobiography Memories of a Catholic Girlhood. Many of the circumstances of Margaret‚Äôs, or Meg‚Äôs, life mirror McCarthy‚Äôs own young adulthood: A college graduate living in New York City; a young first marriage that ends in divorce; works reading manuscripts for a publisher and writes for a liberal magazine.Hardy, Willene Schaefer. Mary McCarthy. New York: Frederick Ungar, 1981. Print. Because McCarthy travelled in high prestigious literary circles, many of the characters are thinly veiled accounts of well-known intellectuals, such as Edmund Wilson and Philip Rahv. However, The Company She Keeps is by no means a purely autobiographical work; McCarthy confesses to reimagining or simply inventing episodes, and doesn‚Äôt always remember which parts of her stories are true and which are fictionalized. McCarthy has stated in interviews that the episode in ‚ÄúThe Man in the Brooks Brothers Shirt‚Äù really did happen, though she changed names and cities to retain a degree of anonymity. = Prior publication = Several of the episodes in The Company She Keeps were originally published in other sources. ‚ÄúCruel and Barbarous Treatment,‚Äù written in 1938 and published in The Southern Review in the spring of 1939, was one of her first works of fiction.Gelderman, Carol. Mary McCarthy: A Life. London: Sidgwick & Jackson, 1989. Print. McCarthy wrote the other five stories that eventually became The Company She Keeps over the course of the next three and a half years. ‚ÄúThe Man in the Brooks Brothers Shirt‚Äù was published in Partisan Review in the summer of 1941, ‚ÄúThe Genial Host‚Äù was published in The Southern Review in the fall of 1941, and ‚ÄúGhostly Father, I Confess‚Äù was published by Harper‚Äôs Bazaar in April 1942. The other two episodes, ‚ÄúRogue‚Äôs Gallery‚Äù and ‚ÄúPortrait of the Intellectual as a Yale Man,‚Äù did not appear in any publications prior to the release, in the spring of 1942, of The Company She Keeps. Form The Company She Keeps consists of six episodes featuring the same heroine, Meg Sargent. However, the stories do not easily cohere into a whole. The narrative voice switches between the second- and third-person, and the heroine‚Äôs name isn't even mentioned until the second episode, and then only obliquely.Crowley, John W. ‚ÄúMary McCarthy‚Äôs The Company She Keeps.‚Äù Explicator, vol. 51, no. 2, pp. 111-115, MLA International Bibliography, doi:http://doi.org/10.1080/00144940.1993.9937991. McCarthy wrote each story as a stand-alone piece; however, the heroine and the underlying themes remained across the different settings and styles. McCarthy said that she began to think of these six stories as one unified story. McCarthy put the stories together to form one collection and was adamant about calling it a novel, but her own formal experimentation intentionally obscures the continuity between episodes. Content * Cruel and Barbarous Treatment. A young, unnamed woman is married, contemplating divorce, and having an affair. She casts her life as a drama between herself and her two lovers ‚Äì the Husband and the Young Man. She doesn't dislike this play, but finds it riddled with clich√©s and without depth. After a while, her affair loses some of its excitement and the protagonist decides that it is no longer enough to be a Woman With A Secret, so she goes through the necessary stages of revealing the affair and leaving her husband. She decides she won't marry the Young Man and begins to fear a life of spinsterhood until she fully begins to embrace the glamor of being a Young Divorcee. Her husband lets her go, and eventually she tires of the Young Man‚Äôs tireless devotion. The story ends with no marriage and no affair, but the heroine refuses to fall into self-pity. She moves forward with her life alone. * Rogue's Gallery. Our heroine, who we now know is Margaret, or Meg, Sargent, works at a strange gallery run by a man named Mr. Sheer whose only profitable items are miniature portraits of dogs set into crystal cufflinks. Mr. Sheer loves Old World luxury items, and keeps his shop filled to the brim with new acquisitions. However, Meg soon finds out that the business is founded on nothing and that all of his items for sale are actually loaned to him on consignment. He lives his life from one flawed deal to another until he eventually vanishes with no forwarding address. Meg runs into him years later; he has achieved success working in someone else‚Äôs gallery. However, he is deeply unhappy and views Meg as his only true friend. * The Man in the Brooks Brothers Shirt. Meg is on a train heading to San Francisco to tell her family about her new fianc√©e ‚Äì who is, of course, not the Young Man of the first story ‚Äì when she meets an older man who is clearly interested in her. Deciding to play the role of the femme fatale, Meg enters his club car and gets drunk with him. Believing she has the upper hand as the object of desire and interest, she is mortified the next morning when she wakes to remember having humiliating sex with him. Meg‚Äôs bohemian lifestyle, represented by her underpants held together with a safety pin, all of a sudden seems pathetic and dirty instead of alluring. Meg leaves him in San Francisco. On her return trip, the man meets her in Cleveland, showering her with expensive gifts ‚Äì but Meg can tell his interest in her is fading. Eventually, he leaves and never again contacts her. * The Genial Host. Meg goes to a party hosted by a dull man named Pflaumen. Pflaumen is a careful director; his apartment is filled with art intended only for guests to look at, and his parties are equally carefully constructed collections of fascinating people. Pflaumen uses his guests as interesting mouthpieces for his social gatherings; in return, he lets them meet interesting influential people and only asks that they allow him to be a part of their lives. This tends to backfire on him, however, as Pflaumen‚Äôs own dullness means that his guests often form connections without him. He tries to insert himself into Meg‚Äôs life by questioning her about her drinking. Meg dislikes him intensely, especially the way he reduces his guests to a single talking point or view, but is seduced by his lifestyle and his connections. * Portrait of the Intellectual as a Yale Man. This episode moves away from Meg and is told from the perspective of Jim Barnett, a self- satisfied, Yale-educated Socialist. When he meets Meg, he finds her exciting but troubling; however, two months later he begins an affair with her. It fizzles out quickly and the two clash over Meg‚Äôs Trotskyism and intensity. When Meg gets fired over her views, Jim quietly resigns in protest and intends to write an important Marxist book; however, the story ends with him going to work for a popular conservative magazine that pays well. * Ghostly Father, I Confess.In the final story, Meg visits her analyst, Dr. James. All of her fragmented selves are present in this meeting, and Meg, ever the author, wants to impress him. Meg‚Äôs tyrannical husband has forced her to attend these sessions; Meg wants to divorce him but is unable to do so. Meg and Dr. James search her child for answers to her unhappiness; they discuss the death of her mother, her father‚Äôs shipment of her to live with her grim Aunt Clara, her mother‚Äôs Catholicism and her father‚Äôs Protestantism, and Meg‚Äôs eventual escape from her Aunt. Dr. James believes that her husband serves as a stand-in for both her tyrannical Aunt Clara and her indifferent father. Meg leaves the office and remembers a dream she had about kissing a Nazi. The story ends with a prayer: ‚ÄúIf the flesh must be blind, let the spirit see. Preserve me in disunity.‚ÄùMcCarthy, Mary. The Company She Keeps. New York: Harcourt, 1942. Print. Literary characteristics While The Company She Keeps is not one of McCarthy‚Äôs better-known works, scholarship falls into three main groups. =Reality vs. fiction= Scholars are fascinated by the autobiographical aspects of The Company She Keeps, and view the novel as a developmental stepping-stone on McCarthy‚Äôs journey towards discovering her identity as a writer. Nowhere does it say that the stories contained in the novel are meant to be chronological, but by assembling the pieces and publishing them as a unit, we are able to follow a thread from the first story to the last. Because McCarthy endows Meg with an author-like literary consciousness, painting her as a director or artist.Hewitt, Rosalie. ‚ÄúA ‚ÄòHome Address for the Self‚Äô: Mary McCarthy‚Äôs Autobiographical Journey.‚Äù The Journal of Narrative Technique, vol. 12, no. 2, 1982, pp. 95-104. https://www.jstor.org/stable/30225042. Thus, readers can approach Meg‚Äôs fragmentation and search for an integrated self as a reflection of McCarthy‚Äôs own journey. =Catholicism= McCarthy‚Äôs most famous work, the autobiography Memories of a Catholic Girlhood, brought to the public‚Äôs attention the role of Catholicism in her upbringing. Because of this, some scholars‚Äô interest lies in analyzing McCarthy‚Äôs other works through the lens of Catholicism. Despite McCarthy‚Äôs avowed Atheism, her early experience with Catholicism shaped her writing and the way she was and continues to be perceived by her Catholic readership. Asceticism and a need for confession and self-understanding permeate her writing.Campbell, Debra. ‚Äú‚ÄòOne of Ours?‚Äô: Catholic Readings of Mary McCarthy, 1942-1964.‚ÄùU.S. Catholic Historian, vol. 20, no. 1, 2002, pp. 99-115, https://www.jstor.org/stable/27671153. In The Company She Keeps, this is evident in the final episode, as well as in the tendency to write thinly veiled accounts of her personal affairs. McCarthy was an important 20th century model of a female, Catholic, coming-of-age story. Other scholars note that this Catholic influence is specifically an Irish- Catholic influence, and that McCarthy approaches her work with an Irish- American literary sensibility. McCarthy broke out of the anti-intellectual, sexist Irish-Catholicism, but still struggled with the Church‚Äôs sexist and restrictive definition of women and Irish fatalism. She tends to romanticize suffering and penance.Donohue, Stacy Lee. ‚ÄúReluctant Radical: The Irish- Catholic Element.‚Äù Twenty-Four Ways of Looking at Mary McCarthy: The Writer and Her Work, Ed. Eve Stwertka and Margo Viscusi. Westport: Greenwood, 1996, pp. 87-97. Print. McCarthy and many of her heroines, like Meg, are trapped between the intellectual and bohemian life of New York in the 1930s and 1940s and the restrictive, traditional values and stereotypes of femininity found in the Catholic Church. =Feminist theory= Some scholars approach The Company She Keeps as an artifact, and examine it in the context of the feminist movements occurring during the book‚Äôs publishing. The novel falls between the first wave of liberal feminism and second wave feminism, and therefore contains elements of each movement ‚Äì concern with diminished options for women in the workforce and sexual liberation from the first wave, and psychological implications of sexist stereotypes and the repressive character of psychiatry as an institution from the second wave.Farland, Maria. ‚ÄúLiterary Feminisms.‚Äù The Cambridge History of the American Novel. Ed. Leonard Cassuto. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011, pp. 925-940. Print. Feminist literature of the time sought to synthesize Marx and Freud and rework their sexist doctrines for contemporary feminism. McCarthy‚Äôs heady intellectualism doesn't shy away from engaging in critique of these two giant figures. Her writing signals the beginning of a pushback against the Old Left by a younger generation of intellectuals, in part by taking a strong stance against Freudian psychiatry by aligning it with patriarchal subordination of female independence for fear that it would lead to madness. Other theorists analyze The Company She Keeps through more contemporary feminist frameworks, such as Judith Butler‚Äôs performativity. Butler‚Äôs theory argues that everyone performs identity types in a gendered world.Marsh, Kelly A. ‚Äú‚ÄòAll My Habits of Mind‚Äô: Performance and Identity in the Novels of Mary McCarthy.‚Äù Studies in the Novel, vol. 34, no. 3, 2002, pp. 303-3019. https://www.jstor.org/stable/29533517. Meg both depends on and fears typification. One of her defining characteristics is her ability to sort people into types, yet she is terrified of being ‚Äútyped‚Äù by others. Simultaneously, Meg‚Äôs search for an integrated self throughout the collection of stories is a search for a neat type to fit into. By forcing her protagonist to search for yet never find a convenient type for herself, McCarthy uses Meg as a model of resistance against typification. Reception The original New York Times review described The Company She Keeps as ‚Äústrange and provocative‚Äù and ‚Äúa most unusual novel‚Ä¶ probably destined to create a minor furor.‚Äù The critic praises McCarthy for her original and exciting depiction of her heroine and the world in which she moves, but criticizes her for her viciousness, especially in her semi-transparent, often unflattering portrayals of actual literary figures. She closes by saying that the novel is as full of contradictions as its main character ‚Äì that on one hand, it is clever and witty; on the other, it lacks maturity.Wharton, Edith H. Review of The Company She Keeps, by Mary McCarthy. New York Times, 24 May 1942. Other contemporaries and publications had similar mixed views. Partisan Review originally published ‚ÄúThe Man in the Brooks Brothers Shirt,‚Äù but found the sex scene so controversial and immature that they refused to publish ‚ÄúThe Genial Host.‚Äù McCarthy‚Äôs husband Edmund Wilson, himself a prominent writer and critic, found the book ingenious, as did Vladimir Nabokov; however, most book reviewers were not as enthusiastic. Many cited McCarthy‚Äôs immaturity and sharpness, calling the book unlikeable and gossipy. Despite the mixed reception, The Company She Keeps sold 10,000 copies.

Hemley In the academic year 1991‚Äì1992 he was a visiting scientist at the Johns Hopkins University and in 1996 and again in 1999 at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure de Lyon. Hemley's research deals with the properties of matter under high pressure with applications in geophysics, geochemistry and planetology, as well as applications in solid-state physics, chemistry, and pressure effects on biomolecules and biological systems; the applications in physics include hydrogen under pressure in the megabar range, generation of novel superconductors, magnetic structures, glasses and superhard materials under high pressure; the applications in chemistry include new compounds under high pressure. Helmley's research has been experimental (e.g. high-pressure studies with spectroscopic methods and generating high pressures with laser-heated diamond anvil cell) and theoretical; he used theory to develop high-pressure experimental methods in conjunction with microscopic laser-optical and X-ray diffraction analysis in situ from synchrotron radiation sources. Hemley worked in the late 1980s with Ho-Kwang Mao, who became famous for his 1976 work with Peter M. Bell on extension of the laboratory pressure range up to pressures over 1 megabar. Hemley, Mao, and Bell investigated not only minerals under pressures corresponding to those in the Earth's interior but also gases and liquids under pressures believed to exist in the interiors of gas giants such as Jupiter and Saturn. In particular, they investigated the behavior of hydrogen at pressures in the megabar range.Mao, Bell, Hemley Ultrahigh pressures: Optical observations and Raman measurements of hydrogen and deuterium to 1.47 Mbar, Physical Review Letters, vol. 55, 1985, pp. 99-102, followed by numerous related studies, summarized in Mao, Hemley Ultrahigh pressure transformations in solid hydrogen, Reviews of Modern Physics, vol. 66, 1994, pp. 671‚Äì692 Hemley has published over 490 articles as an author or co-authorRussell Hemley elected Honoris Causa Professor of the Russian Academy of Scieces  Carnegie Institution for Science, 9 July 2008 and has been awarded several patents.Russell Hemley Appointed Director of Carnegie's Geophysical Laboratory, carnegiescience.edu, 5 February 2007 Hemley received in 2005 the Balzan Prize jointly with Ho-Kwang MaoRussell J.

Practicing artists are mainly concerned with the preservation of time-honored skills in creating works of figurative and representational forms of fine art as a means to express human emotions and experiences. Subjects are based on the aesthetics of balancing external reality with the intuitive, internal conscience driven by emotion, philosophical thought, or the spirit. The term is used broadly to encompass all styles and practices of representational art, such as Classicism, Impressionism, Realism, and Plein Air (En plein air) painting. Technical skills are founded in the teachings of the Renaissance, Academic Art, and American Impressionism.  Organizations  Organized groups of practicing artists and institutions dedicated to furthering classical techniques include the Grand Central Atelier, Art Renewal Center, California Art Club, Florence Academy of Art, the Imperial Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg, Russia, Laguna College of Art and Design, Los Angeles Academy of Figurative Art, New York Academy of Art, and Portrait Society of America.

History In 1929, the state government merged the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Markets, and consolidated the Dairy and Food Commissioner, the State Treasury Agent, the State Supervisor of Inspectors of Illuminating Oils, and the State Humane Agent to form the Department of Agriculture and Markets. The department was overseen by three commissioners who were all appointed by the governor. In 1939, the department was renamed the Department of Agriculture. The department was then overseen by a seven member Board of Agriculture, who were all appointed by the governor and confirmed by the state Senate. All seven members were required to have an agricultural background. This board appointed the department's Secretary. In 1979, the department was renamed the Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection. The law was changed so that one of the seven members on the board must be a consumer representative. In 1995, the state legislature allowed the governor to appoint the department Secretary, and expanded the board to eight members, including two consumer representatives.

Using this system, authorities can send messages to users of mobile phones in specific areas by using specific cell towers to alert phones within their reach https://www.government.nl/documents/leaflets/2017/06/23/nl-alert- factsheet. NL-Alert is one of the first implementations of the EU-Alert or Reverse 1-1-2 legislation as defined by the binding European Electronic Communications Code (EECC) using the Cell Broadcast technology for the delivery of public warning messages to the general public.  Usage of the Service  The system was introduced nationally on 8 November 2012https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2012/11/08/nationwide-launch-of- emergency-alert-system-nl-alert Retrieved 8 November 2012 , and was first used in a large fire in Tolbert on 14 December 2012. The second use was in another fire in Meppel in 2013. NL-Alert has been used more than 200 times until December 2017 for public warning purposes (e.g. large forest & industrial fires, severe weather conditions and gas leakages).  Background  NL-Alert is an addition to the existing emergency population warning system, which works using a large amount of sirens on masts throughout the country. A key difference between these systems is that users of NL-Alert are not only warned, but also immediately informed about the situation. NL-Alert messages include the location of an incident and advice on bringing oneself to safety. NL-Alert messages have a distinct alarm sound - which stops when the message is seen by the user. Receiving NL-Alert is free. A user does not have to register to receive alerts, but may need to configure a device to receive cell broadcasts. Increasingly, mobile phones are pre-configured by their manufacturers to receive cell broadcasts, including NL-Alert, via 2G, 3G and 4G systems. NL-Alert Cell Broadcast configuration menu on Android 7.1  Adoption Rate  NL-Alert has been used in the Netherlands for several years, and every six months a test message is sent which is broadcast throughout the Netherlands. The reach of the Control Cell Broadcast message has increased over the years resulting that in June 2020 more than 13.6 million (90%) citizens of 12 years and older received directly the test warning Cell Broadcast message on their mobile phone. There is great willingness to pass on an NL-Alert message to others, from the 10% of people who did not receive the message (e.g. because they do not have a mobile phone), 4% heard it through other people and reaching with this single Cell Broadcast message in total 14.2 million people - 94% of the Dutch population of 12 years and older. *7 December 2015 - 7.1 million people of 12 years and older (49%) (full nationwide LTE coverage)https://crisis.nl/nl-alert/nieuws/7-1-miljoen-mensen- ontvangen-nl-alert-controlebericht/ *6 June 2016 - 8.3 million people of 12 years and older (57%) *5 December 2016 - 8.8 million people of 12 years and older (60%)https://crisis.nl/nl-alert/nieuws/8-8-miljoen-mensen-ontvangen-nl- alert-controlebericht/ *3 July 2017 - 9.2 million people of 12 years and older (63%)https://crisis.nl/nl-alert/nieuws/meer-dan-9-miljoen-mensen-ontvangen-nl- alert-controlebericht/ *4 December 2017 - 10.8 million people of 12 years and older (74%)https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2017/12/04/nationwide-nl- alert-verification-message-on-monday-4-december *4 June 2018 - 11.3 million people of 12 years and older (76%)https://crisis.nl/nl- alert/nieuws/10-miljoen-mensen-ontvangen-nl-alert-controlebericht/ *3 December 2018 - 12.43 million people of 12 years and older (83%)https://crisis.nl/nl- alert/nieuws/driekwart-van-de-nederlanders-ontving-nl-alert-controlebericht- op-mobiel/ *3 June 2019 - 13.18 million people of 12 years and older (88%)https://www.security.nl/posting/613417/Ruim+11%2C7+miljoen+mensen+ontvingen+NL- Alert+controlebericht *2 December 2019 - 13.7 million people of 12 years and older (90.7%)https://www.tellerreport.com/tech/2019-12-17---test-report-nl- alert-on-smartphone-received-by-12-9-million-people-.ryeT3Ge8Cr.html https://www.rijnmondveilig.nl/algemeen/nl-alert-op-2-december-ontvangen- door-129-miljoen-mensen/ *8 June 2020 - 14.2 million people of 12 years and older (94% of the population)https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2020/06/22/ruim-90-van- de-nederlanders-ontving-nl-alert-controlebericht-op-mobiel  Multi Channel Approach  NL-Alert is using Cell Broadcast as the primary channel to issue warnings and alerts. As no channel will suit every situation or every person, multiple channels are used by NL-Alert to make sure as many people as possible receive the information they need. This includes since December 2018 digital information screens at stops of bus, tram and metro (public transport). Additional dissemination channels are expected to be added in the coming period.

He is one of the original painters in the style, abstract illusionism, of the 1970s and has since evolved his style using computerized technologies to create Digital art.  Life and work  Doyle established himself as a painter during the movement toward new abstraction in San Francisco in the mid-seventies. Stylistically his work evolved from photo-realist renderings of aircraft which exaggerated differences in focus of background and foreground\\".Harcourts Contemporary Gallery press release By 1975 his imagery shifted to arrangements of flat, geometric forms and tubular squiggles in a trompe l'oeil manner that created the illusion of a multi-layered, three dimensional space. By the late 1970s Doyle, along with James Havard, Jack Reilly, George D. Green, and others, had attained national prominence working this style now referred to as Abstract Illusionism. Doyle and others were included in 'Reality of Illusion' a large touring exhibition of primarily American illusionist artists organized by the University of Southern California and The Denver Art Museum.Reality of Illusion, Donald J Brewer, University Art Galleries of The University of Southern California 1979 According to an interview by Mark Levy in the January/February, 1982 issue of Art Voices,Mark Levy. \\"Joe Doyle\\", Art Voices. January/February, 1982, p. 33 Doyle began his artistic career in the Air Force, where Doyle says he was relieved of difficult assignments and encouraged to paint by a sergeant who appreciated his realistic landscape paintings. When he began painting abstractly, however, the sergeant relegated him to K.P. duty. Following the Air Force Doyle enrolled at San Francisco State College receiving his M.A. in 1971. From 1971 to 1975 he was a photo- realist transferring images from photographs using airbrush techniques on canvas, occasionally adding political satire into the subject matter, as in \\"Ice House (1971). Doyle is currently an instructor and co-chair of the Digital Arts Department at Berkeley City College. In 2010 then Berkeley Mayor Tom Bates and the Berkeley City Council recognized Doyle and the Berkeley City College‚Äôs Digital Arts Club (DAC) for \\"its talent, creativity, and its many years of artistic contributions to Bay Area galleries and exhibits.\\".

Despite its name, the C&C; 27 Mk V was a new design, unrelated to the original C&C; 27\\\\. The design was originally marketed by the manufacturer as the \\"new C&C; 27\\", but is now usually referred to as the Mark V to differentiate it from the earlier C&C; 27 Mark I, II, III and IV designs. The C&C; 26 Wave is a sailboat derived from the C&C; 27 Mk V, but with a wing keel and shorter mast. Production The C&C; 27 Mk V was built by C&C; Yachts in Canada at Niagara-On-The-Lake and in the United States at the C&C; plant in Rhode Island, but it is now out of production. The boats were built at Niagara-On-The-Lake with serial number prefix ZCC and numbered from 001 to 169. The Rhode Island built boats have the serial number prefix CCY and number from 500 to 610.

The previous C&C; 27 series cost as much to built as the larger C&C; boats, but commanded a lower retail price. The C&C; 27 Mk V is a small recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fibreglass. It has a masthead sloop rig and a fixed keel, available in standard fin and shoal draft. The design features a raked stem, a reverse transom and a transom-hung rudder controlled by a tiller. The fin keel version displaces and carries of lead ballast. The shoal draft keel version displaces and carries of ballast.

The Conservatives achieved their best result since the unitary council was created in 1995, winning twenty seats and replacing the Liberal Democrats as the official opposition on the council. Plaid Cymru also secured their highest popular vote, despite standing in fewer seats than in 2012, but only won three seats. The Liberal Democrats in Cardiff suffered their worst election result in terms of total seats won (eleven) since 1995, whilst the local Green Party failed to win its first seat on the council, suffering a fall in support when compared to the 2012 election. The only independent candidate to be elected was Fenella Bowden in the Heath ward, who will become Cardiff Council's longest serving independent councillor during the council term. The only member of the original council elected in 1995 who had served continuously since then was Russell Goodway, former leader of the Council, who was again returned for the Ely ward.

For example, Kydd and Walter define terrorism as \\"the use of violence against civilians by non-state actors to attain political goals.\\" The US Department of State defines terrorism as \\"premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents.\\" On the other hand, the FBI's Code of Federal Regulations defines terrorism as \\"The unlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives. The lack of a universal definition of terrorism has led to controversies, making it sometimes difficult to label a certain attack as a terrorist incident. For example, Tarik Kafala, head of BBC Arabic insists journalists must stop using the term \\"terrorist\\", because it is a \\"value- laden\\" term. Furthermore, there have been controversies, such as Obama's refusal to use the phrase, \\"Islamic terrorism\\", with political implications. Vagueness of definition There are several problems with the definition of terrorism. =No universally accepted definition= There is no universally accepted definition of terrorism. In his paper \\"Defining Terrorism: Is One Man's Terrorist Another Man's Freedom Fighter?\\", Boaz Ganor points out the urgency of an internationally accepted definition of terrorism due to the ambiguousness of the term. Even within the country of the United States, the US Department of State and the FBI have different definitions of terrorism, which can lead one institute to classify an event as terrorist while another does not. =Vague wording= Another issue with the definition of terrorism is its vague wording. Navin Bapat, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and expert on terrorist campaigns, points out the subjective nature of words used in definitions of terrorism, such as \\"non-combatant\\" and \\"political purposes\\". The subjectivity of such words allows for dispute over whether a group is or is not terrorist, as questions such as the degree to which the attack was pre-meditated, the degree to which a subnational group was involved with the premeditation of the attack, or the definition of a \\"non-combatant\\" and what ideologies are considered \\"political\\" may arise. =Examples= Steve Biko was a South African anti-apartheid activist who believed that some violence against whites was inevitable while apartheid remained in place. He was a leading figure of the South African Students' Organization, and participated in founding the Black People's Convention. According to many definitions of terrorism, including the US Department of State and Kydd & Walter as well as the Terrorism Act of South Africa at the time, Steve Biko's activities qualified as terrorism. Steve Biko was arrested under the South African Terrorism Act, and died while in custody. Today, Steve Biko is appraised as a hero. Manning Marable and Peniel Joseph also referred to him as \\"one of South Africa's greatest fighters - and martyrs - for freedom.\\" In a public vote in 2004, Steve Biko was elected 13th of SABC3's Great South Africans. This example illustrates that some \\"terrorists\\" may become \\"heroes\\" when alternate perspectives are acknowledged. Similarly, the Edelweiss Pirates were a group of youth that stood up against the Nazi regime, sometimes using violence. Some of the members were arrested and executed for conspiring to plant a bomb at the Gestapo headquarters. According to the definition of terrorism as outlined by the US Department of State, this group can be categorized as terrorist, as they are a subnational group that planned politically-motivated violence against noncombatant targets. In 2005, however, the German authorities gave official recognition to the Edelweiss Pirates as resistance heroes after 60 years of denouncing them as a criminal organization. That German authorities may recognize as heroes a group that not only was once considered a criminal group but can also presently qualify as a terrorist group, clearly demonstrates the vagueness of the various definitions of terrorism currently used by different institutions around the world. A more recent and more controversial example is the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting. Though it has been established that the shooter, Omar Mateen, pledged allegiance to ISIS, there is no evidence that ISIS provided operational support. If this incident is to be labeled \\"terrorist\\" according to the definition of terrorism as defined by the US Department of State, Mateen must be acting as an agent of ISIS. However, ISIS's lack of direct involvement in the premeditation and execution of the attack provides complications. Islam and terrorism Much controversy exists over the association of Islam with terrorism. Since the September 11 attacks, any act of violence has been prone to being labeled as \\"terrorist\\" if the perpetrator is Muslim, regardless of the intentions and organization details of the attack, rendering the definitions of terrorism void. For example, the 2017 Westminster attack has been described as a terrorist attack by various media agencies. However, as with the Orlando nightclub shooting, no evidence linking the Khalid Massood, the attacker, to terrorist organizations has been found. Similarly, the Charlie Hebdo shooting sparked controversy when Tarik Kafala, head of BBC Arabic, claimed that the attack must not be labeled as one of terrorist nature by the media because the term terrorist is value-laden. At the same time, Muslims have been subject to particular scrutiny. In their paper, \\"‚ÄòI‚Äôm a Muslim, but I'm not a Terrorist‚Äô: Victimization, Risky Identities and the Performance of Safety\\", Mythen, Walklate & Khan highlight the risk, identity, and experience of victimization that British Muslims encounter due to the current discourse on terrorism, which is biased towards Muslims. Kosic and Nordio point out how the discourse on terrorism has created a tension between self and the \\"Other\\" in Europe, creating difficulties in communities' acceptance of immigrants. Such isolation of the Muslim community has led to scandalous incidents, particularly in airports and aircraft. For example, in August, 2016, three siblings were removed from an EasyJet flight from Stansted to Naples after being falsely accused of reading ISIS materials. Muslim communities have also experienced hate crimes, such as when an arsonist set fire at the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce. Political implications Governments can use the label and definitions of terrorism to convince the public that measures are being taken to protect them. For example, terrorism can be addressed as either a military problem or a criminal problem. President George W. Bush categorized terrorists as militants by declaring a war on terrorism, while President Barack Obama used counter-terrorist measures rather than military measures. Governments can also use the label to isolate groups. Isolated groups may be oppressed, discriminated against, and delegitimized. The isolation of groups by labeling them as terrorist has led to a division between the in-group and out-group, causing mistrust and caution towards immigration. This phenomenon is leading to the rise of extreme-right leaning candidates in Europe, particularly. For example, President Donald J. Trump has called for a temporary travel ban from countries next to war zones or with inadequate identification measures from entering the United States, citing terrorism as justification. Reports from the Southern Poverty Law Center claim that President Trump‚Äôs campaign contributed to the tripling of hate groups against Muslims from 34 in 2015 to 101 in 2016 The FBI found that hate crimes against Muslims increased by 67% in 2015; the increase was due to more municipalities recording such incidents and not an actual increase in events. The SPLC documented over 300 bias-related incidents targeting immigrants or Muslims in the first 10 days after Trump‚Äôs election; this was also due to more municipalities recording such incidents and not an actual increase in the occurrence. Another example is Israel's political actions. Israel labels Palestinian political violence against them as terrorist, which allows Israel to reject negotiation. On the other hand, when Israel executed Operation Wooden Leg on Tunisia, leaving 47 dead and 65 wounded, the US's initial statement claimed that it was a \\"legitimate response to terrorism\\". However, Benjamin Netanyahu distinguished terrorism as \\"a deliberate targeting of civilians\\", \\"deliberate and systematic murder and maiming designed to inspire fear\\". Similarly, according to Noam Chomsky, Israel carried out a large number of air and artillery attacks killing civilians during the 2006 Lebanon War, some of which may have deliberately targeted civilians. The war left 1,191 Lebanese civilians and 44 Israeli civilians dead.

He has most-recently shared new music videos for his singles \\"Mean It\\", and \\"To Live And Die in New England\\" which will be featured on his debut LP, Don't Panic later this month. Life and career  =Early life - 2015 = Ryan was born to and raised by working-class parents in the Boston suburb of Pembroke, MA. Not having any family members to introduce him to music, Ryan found an old keyboard that he played every day. He soon became self-taught, having also learned how to play piano, drums, guitar, and bass. By learning to play the guitar and piano, and experimenting with his laptop and BitTorrent, Ryan found his musical influences - which include Kanye West, Coldplay, Blink-182, Bon Iver and Frank Ocean - and honed his sound. Ryan found his voice when he left his industrial warehouse job in Pembroke and headed west. Working odd jobs, couch surfing, and eventually living in his car, he would record the vocals and instrumentals on his laptop in parking lots, campgrounds, and anywhere that he could. \\"I so wasn't there, like, consciously. I think my subconscious was just... wanted so bad to just be a professional musician, so that's the only thing I could resort to. It was the only thing I had at the time. I didn't have money, I didn't have a place to stay, I didn't have work. So music was the only thing that I had,\\" said Ryan. =2016 - Present= Ryan headed back east in the fall of 2016 to piece together the recordings from his time out west for his debut LP, Don‚Äôt Panic, set to release June 23, 2017. He returned home to what was once a harder household, to one he says is now \\"fully recovered\\" and a source of inspiration for him. Don't Panic is inspired by the struggles Ryan faced growing up, as well as past experiences. According to Ryan, his career is a testament to where he came from and, through his music, he hopes to tell the stories of his friends, family, and everyone he grew up with. On Don't Panic, Ryan says: \\"This whole album that's coming out is kind of based on a surprise, actually. I had signed a deal, and I thought I was finally on the track to where I wanted to be as a musician. Then I ended up moving out to California, and one bad thing turned into another and I actually ended up living in my car for a year. I would say my album comes half from that and half from coming back home and realizing how much I missed it and how much of a part of me it was.\\" In May 2017, Ryan released the single and music video for \\"Mean It\\" which was featured on Spotify's 'New Music Friday' playlist and exposed to the playlist's 2 million followers.

It was founded in the Tremont Street Methodist Episcopal Church, in Boston, Massachusetts, March 1869. The society was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1884. Dr. Clara Swain Mary Clarke Nind Sigourney Trask Nancie Monelle Mansell Anna Fisher Beiler Its receipts during the first year were , and in the year 1903,, with a total from the beginning of . Six branches were organized the first year. By 1903, there were eleven, the first being the New England, and the eleventh being the Columbia River Branch. The first number of the society's first periodical, The Heathen Woman's Friend, appeared in June, 1869, with Harriet Merrick Warren as its editor for 24 years. Other publications were established later on. History The Woman's Foreign Missionary Society was organized in the Tremont Street Methodist Episcopal Church, Boston, in March 1869 by eight women who responded to a call sent to thirty churches. The eight founders were, Mrs. Lewis Flanders; Mrs. Thomas Kingsbury; Mrs. William B. Merrill; Lois Lee Parker; Mrs. Thomas A. Rich; Mrs. H.J. Stoddard; and Mrs. P.T. Taylor. A window in the Tremont Street Church commemorates the event and preserves their names. The first public meeting of the society was held in the Bromfield Street Methodist Episcopal Church, May 26, 1869. The discussion was quickly followed by decisive action. At a business meeting held by the women at the close of the public occasion, it was voted to raise money to send as a missionary to India, Isabella Thoburn, sister of Bishop James Mills Thoburn. An appeal for a medical woman soon followed. As a result of prompt and efficient measures to procure funds, the services of Isabella Thoburn and of Clara Swain, M.D., were secured. These two women sailed from New York City for India, via England, on November 3, 1869, reaching their destination early in January, 1870. They were cordially received, and soon entered upon a their work, Thoburn organizing schools and superintending the work of Bible readers, and Swain's medical ability gaining for her admission to many places that were closed to others. This society sent to India, China, Korea, and Japan the first woman medical missionary ever received in those countries. By 1903, its 34th year, it had 265 missionaries carrying on its work in India, China, Japan, Korea, Africa, Bulgaria, Italy, South America, Mexico, and the Philippines, by means of women's colleges, high schools, seminaries, hospitals, dispensaries, day schools, and \\"settlement work\\".

During the interwar period he helped co-found, on instruction from the Reichsluftfahrtministerium, the Signals intelligence organization called the Forschungsamt (Abbr. FA); along with Hermann G√∂ring and Gottfried Schapper. He was responsible for the organization between 1933 and 1935. Career Hans Schimpf who was the son of the entrepreneur Ernst Schimpf, and entered the German Navy at a young age. He had reached the rank of Korvettenkapit√§n by 1933. In 1933, Schimpf came to the notice of Hermann G√∂ring who was looking for new trained personnel for his new agency, the Forschungsamt. Schimpf had been acting as a liaison officer between the Reichsmarine Signals intelligence service, B-Dienst and the German Army signals intercept service, the Abwehr cipher bureau. At that time, Schimpf was a personal friend of G√∂ring and a Nazi. During his time at the Reichswehr cipher bureau, Schimpf was somewhat of a dark horse, who had organized within it a Nazi Party cell, in secret. He undertook several trips abroad to link the Abwehr cipher bureau with Italian Armed Forces, e.g. Servizio Informazioni Militare and also set up a small illicit German intercept station on an private estate near Barcelona in Spain. The intercept station was configured to intercept shipping traffic in the Mediterranean, for the Reichsmarine. It also monitored French radio stations in North Africa and southwestern France. Schimpf has made a large number of contacts, and leading personalities with fascist organizations in Italy and Spain, which attracted G√∂ring. Schimpf was entrusted to start the new agency. He selected 8 people, along with Gottfried Schapper, who had the original idea for the FA agency to be the new key people in the unit. All were Nazi Party members. Schimpf started the new FA agency, in March 1933. By 30 June 1934, during the Night of the Long Knives, Schimpf had been promoted to ministerial rank (), which ensured for himself a position of great power. In early 1933, Reinhard Heydrich, the head of the Reich Main Security Office, who was competing with Goering's research office, tried to persuade Schimpf to work for him and Heinrich Himmler and the SS, without the knowledge of G√∂ring, which he refused. Instead, Heydrich is supposed to have tried to extort abuse because of his numerous foreign affairs.Heinz H√∂hne : The Time of Illusions , 1994, p. 97. Death In mid-April 1935, Schimpf, who could always be reached by telephone, had gone away for an indefinite period. Rumours began to circulate, due to the conflicting information that was coming from the agency, then it was confirmed: Schimpf was dead. Several versions of his death were reported, including a car accident, that happened in Silesia, then in Berlin, then in K√ºnigsberg. Later people were informed he committed suicide, with a dozen locations mentioned as the place of death, with one story that he killed himself with a lady friend. Deviated reports suggest that he was killed by a Czech agent. The American historian Jonathan Petropoulos, who in his book 'Royals and the Reich: The Princes of Hesse in Nazi Germany', also discussed Schimpf's successor, Prince Christoph of Hesse, who was a SS member, and was appointed new director of the FA the day after Schimpfs' body was discovered, argues that the most likely scenario is an assassination of Schimpf as office chief () on behalf of Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich, seeing the FA as an unwelcome competitor to the security service of the SS, which was under their control. Wilhelm F. Flicke, a German World War II veteran cipher officer who was commissioned by General Erich Fellgiebel to write a history of German cryptography and cryptanalysis during the war, wrote in his book War secrets in the ether the following: :for his eavesdropping on the Reichswehr, Schimpf had recruited and organized an agent network within the organization for his work. In March 1935, one of these agents had extracted an exceedingly important document from a safe in the Reichswehr in order to turn it over to the FA for Mimeographing and inspection. The documents were needed by the Reichswehr, a few days before Easter and they couldn't be located. An investigation was initiated, with the results reported to Werner von Blomberg, who was in opposition to Hermann G√∂ring and Schimpf, made a case before Hitler, who ended up disavowing Schimpf. On the 10 April 1935, when G√∂ring was getting married, Schimpf was found in Gr√ºnewald with a bullet hole in his head. There can be no doubt that Schimpf did not commit suicide but was assassinated by the Gestapo. Schimpf was a generally happy individual who was extremely fond of life, but became dangerous to both G√∂ring and Himmler, and had to be killed. Schimpf was cremated in a crematory in Wilmersdorf in an elaborate ceremony carried out by G√∂ring. A large wreath was delivered with the inscription: To my Faithful Collaborator Hans Schimpf, In Gratitude Hermann G√∂ring This was followed by an address by State Secretary Erhard Milch and a salute of honour.

The film also played an important role in Esquenazi's own decision to come out at the age of 33 while making the film. Esquenazi first heard about the story from friend and mentor Debbie Nathan. The filmmaker was struck by Elizabeth Ramirez's trial transcripts and a home VHS tape of the family, and decided to meet the women.http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/04/deborah- esquenazi-on-her-doc-southwest-of-salem.html After visiting the accused in prison and developing a strong connection to the story, Esquenazi set out to make the film and ultimately a difference in their lives. The original idea was to turn it into a radio piece, however it was not picked up by anyone. The story was then going to become a short film for Texas Monthly but faced challenges in funding. Then, after releasing footage of one of the victims recanting her testimony in 2012, tape of her reaction was sent to the local press and the story took off. The film went on to win several awards including Outstanding Documentary at the 28th GLAAD Media Awards as well as a 2017 Peabody Award. Consistent with Esquenazi's goal as a filmmaker, Southwest of Salem tackles issues of misogyny, prejudice, homophobia, and the harsh reality of LGBTQAI lives in everyday, societal, and political contexts. As a filmmaker, Esquenazi aims to use media to reveal societal inequities, rally support for important causes, and create probing, powerful cinema.https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5639137ae4b06ea3a17a19df/t/588b7e49d1758e14ec3e9bb4/1485536853720/SOUTHWEST+OF+SALEM+PRESS+KIT+2017+correct.pdf References Category:American documentary filmmakers Category:American investigative journalists Category:American radio producers Category:Writers from Austin, Texas Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:American women non-fiction writers Category:Women documentary filmmakers ","title":"Deborah S.

Biography Sader received all his higher education credentials from the University of S√£o Paulo. He did his bachelor's degree in philosophy, his master's degree in political philosophy and his doctoral degree in political science. He also worked at the University of S√£o Paulo as a professor of philosophy and later of political science. He also worked as a professor of political science at University of Campinas in Brazil and as a researcher at the Center for Socioeconomic Studies at the University of Chile. After his retirement from the University of S√£o Paulo, he joined the State University of Rio de Janeiro as director of the Public Policies Laboratory (LPP). He currently teaches Sociology at the State University of Rio de Janeiro and serves as the executive secretary of the Latin American Council of Social Sciences Known to be a Marxist thinker, Sader has worked with national and foreign publications. He was a member of the editorial board of the New Left Review, a 160-page journal published every two months from London that examines world politics; the global economy, state powers and protest movements; contemporary social theory, history and philosophy; cinema, literature, heterodox art and aesthetics. NLR is also published in Spanish. Sader's contributions to the NLR include The Worker's Party in Brazil (1987); Beyond Civil Society (2002); Taking Lula's Measure (2005); and The Weakest Link? Neoliberalism in Latin America (2008). Between 1997 and 1999, Sader chaired the Latin American Sociological Association (LASA), the largest professional association in the world for individuals and institutions engaged in the study of Latin America. Sader was also one of the World Social Forum organizers (WSF). First held in Brazil, the WSF is an annual meeting of civil society organizations.https://fsm2016.org/en/sinformer/a-propos-du-forum-social- mondial/ One of the main goals behind organizing the WSF is an effort to develop an alternative future through the championing of counter-hegemonic globalization . Nonetheless, Sader grew more critical of the WSF for their exclusion of political parties. He believed that in confining themselves to the social sphere, the WSF is \\"unable to create the instruments needed to fight political hegemony.\\" In 2005 Sader published an article on the website of the news agency Carta Maior in response to a statement made by Senator Jorge Bornhausen. Representing the PFL, Liberal Front Party (renamed to Democrats), the senator was asked if he was unhappy with the political crisis of corruption facing Brazil then. He responded that he was happy because \\"we would be free from this race for the next 30 years,\\" in reference to politicians from the Worker's Party, President Lula's party.http://brazzil.com/8369-brazil-court-maintains-one-year-sentence- against-professor-for-defamation/ Sader's article accuses Santa Catarina state's Senator Jorge Bornhausen of being elitist, bourgeois, fascist and racist. Reacting against the article, Bornhausen filed a criminal defamation lawsuit against the professor, based on the defamation provisions of the 1967 Press Law. In October 2006 Sader was sentenced to one year of prison and to dismissal from his position as a professor with the University of Rio de Janeiro. Following those events intellectuals headed by Ant√¥nio C√¢ndido circulated a petition in support of Sader and condemning the sentence . According to the manifesto, the judicial decision goes against freedom of expression, inhibiting and criminalizing \\"critical thinking\\", and \\"university autonomy .\\" Due to compulsory legal provisions, the prison sentence was converted to community service for 8 hours a week for the same period.http://brazzil.com/8369-brazil-court-maintains-one-year-sentence- against-professor-for-defamation/ In 2011, Sader was nominated for the presidency of the Casa de Rui Barbosa Foundation. The foundation is a federal public institution, linked to the ministry of culture, founded to promote intellectual work and to preserve national memory.http://www.casaruibarbosa.gov.br/interna.php?ID_S=1 After his nomination, Sader was critical of Ana Buarque de Hollanda, the minister of culture with Folha de S. Paulo newspaper, because of her silence in reaction to the budget cuts imposed on the ministry of culture. Some believe that Sader's criticisms played a part in the abortion of his nomination.http://oglobo.globo.com/politica/ministra-da-cultura-ana-de- hollanda-se-irrita-com-declaracoes-de-emir-sader-2816959 Sader's experience is mainly in the area of political science, with emphasis on state and government.

Its plot follows a husband-and- wife team of doctors who attempt to open a rehabilitation center in a mansion built over a gateway to hell. Location The movie was filmed at Montezuma Castle. Plot Psychiatrist C.J. Arnold buys an abandoned mansion, once owned by a Civil War general named Emilio Vargas, which was built over hot sulfur pits. There, he plans to set up a drug rehab center. C.J. recruits a group of volunteers to help clean up and renovate the large house. Almost immediately, C.J.'s wife, Dr. Caroline Arnold, senses a presence that starts to manifest as a ghostly apparition. Soon thereafter, more strange and eerie things start to happen which start to agitate the volunteers, along with the resident dog. Later on, C.J. discovers a trap door in the basement, which he opens up and unknowingly unleashes a menacing spirit. Suddenly, all of the doors and windows become locked, trapping everyone inside the mansion. They soon discover that the trap door in the basement is actually a gateway into hell. While Felicia is sleeping, she is suddenly attacked by an invisible force that beats her and tears her clothing off. Her screams are heard by the others, who come to console her. The group attempt to find a way out of the house, and decide to scale the wall from a turret on the house. Peter attempts to descend using a rope, but is overtaken by an invisible force. C.J. attempts to pull him back to safety, but the rope becomes inexplicably hot, before Pete's body spontaneously combusts, and falls to the ground. Further attempts to escape are fruitless, including the men attempting to saw the door open with a skillsaw, as the blade inexplicably wears down rapidly, inflicting no damage on the wood. While doing so, Raymond inadvertently saws through his own hand. Mary flees upstairs to retrieve bandages. She is attacked by the dog in the hallway, who lunges at her, knocking both over the staircase railing, causing them both to fall to their deaths. C.J. begins storing all of the deceased's bodies in an enclosed porch, but shortly after finds that Mary's body has vanished. Meanwhile, Caroline witnesses the apparition of a man motioning for her to pick up an iron cross in the parlor. When she does, the apparition vanishes. She subsequently finds C.J., Raymond, and Felicia standing over Mary's corpse in a trancelike state; when she appears with the cross, however, it drives the three into a fit, and they return to consciousness, unaware of what just occurred. A short time later, Laurie, Felicia, and Raymond attempt to melt the iron bars covering the windows with electrical cables. During the attempt, Laurie is dragged away upstairs by an unseen entity. Raymond chases after her, but is thrown down the staircase by the force. In a panic, Raymond and Felicia resume their endeavor, but Felicia is killed when Mary's corpse reanimates, startling her and causing her to fall back against the iron bars, electrocuting her to death. The electricity causes the bars in one of the windows to melt, and Raymond leaps through the window. As he runs away from the house, however, the ground beneath him turns to quicksand, and he sinks into the mud, drowning. Meanwhile, Caroline becomes possessed by Vargas, whose apparition she has repeatedly seen; Vargas, using Caroline's body as a conduit, tells C.J. he has released \\"the evil\\" in the house by unlocking the pit. Together, they descend into the basement to close the pit, but are overcome by a powerful force that knocks Caroline into the pit. C.J. descends into the pit to get her, and the two find a series of tunnels. There, C.J. enters a white cavern, where he is confronted by the Devil, who threatens and belittles him. Caroline appears with the cross, stabbing it into the Devil's chest, and together she and C.J. flee, escaping the pit and sealing it closed. When they do, the windows and doors of the house miraculously unlock. They flee outside, while Vargas' spirit watches from a window.  Cast  Release The Evil was released theatrically in the spring of 1978, with screenings beginning on March 8 in San Francisco. Critical response Variety reviewed the film favorably, writing that the film has a \\"psychological insight [that] is rare in suspensers, and is a credit to both Crenna, who delivers a strong performance, and director Gus Trikonis. Fulcrum of pic‚Äôs success or failure comes in final scenes, when Crenna and Pettet confront the devil himself, played with sinister angelicism by Victor Buono.\\" Linda Gross of the Los Angeles Times deemed the film \\"a scary and atmospheric thriller\\" with \\"excruciating suspense,\\" also praising the performances and music. Bob Keaton of the Fort Lauderdale News noted the plot as \\"familiar,\\" but conceded that \\"for those who enjoy the genre, The Evil is just their cup of horror.\\" Patrick Taggart of the Austin American-Statesman was less laudatory of the film, characterizing it as \\"yet another horror movie set in an old mansion... The actors seem absolutely bored to death, as you likely will be after 20 minutes' worth of viewing... Gus Trikonis directed with a flair that elevated tedium to the level of religion.\\" Daniel Ruth of The Tampa Tribune was also critical of the film, writing that \\"the film is about as original as a room at the Holiday Inn... It is a film that stretches the limits of tastelessness with gratuitous displays of blood-letting for the sake of pursuing obtuse theological questions of right versus wrong, good versus evil.\\" See also * List of ghost films Notes  References  External links  Category:1978 films Category:1978 horror films Category:American films Category:American supernatural horror films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in country houses Category:Films shot in New Mexico Category:American ghost films Category:American haunted house films Category:New World Pictures films Category:The Devil in fiction Category:1970s exploitation films Category:1970s supernatural films Category:American exploitation films ","title":"The Evil (1978 film)"},{"id":"54088179","title":"Celestine Ukwu"},{"id":"54088183","text":"Anne Imhof (born 1978 in Giessen, Germany) is a German visual artist, choreographer, and performance artist who lives and works between Frankfurt and Paris.

Formed in 2015, they have been referred to as the first all-female punk band in Belarus and compared to the riot grrrl movement. Their lyrical themes are mostly concerned with \\"how a post-Soviet society favours an ordinary person, and how people in positions of power oppress those who choose to live differently\\". Due to their country's authoritarian government, restriction of personal and political freedoms, as well as its patriarchal social norms, Messed Up have oftentimes had to organise concerts practically illegally and thus have arguably found greater success playing abroad in the neighbouring countries of Poland and Lithuania, where they have frequently performed at numerous points throughout the band's history. Igor Bantser, frontman of Grodno-based street punk group Mister X, has helped the band grow and aided its members with translation as well as promotion; Messed Up and Mister X have also performed together at various concerts in several countries across Eastern Europe. For a time, Messed Up founding member Katya also played as the drummer for Mister X. All members of the band are activists in their personal lives and are strictly opposed to sexism, homophobia, racism, fascism, and ageism. Inspired by left- wing and anarchist themes, all the founding members were in their late teens when the band was formed and identify as feminists. Messed Up have played alongside Moscow Death Brigade in Germany, at the Wroc≈Çaw Tattoo Konwent 2017, as well as performing at the fourth edition of the 161 Fest in Warszawa, Poland. They released their first demo available for free download in October 2016. Their first full-length album, released on vinyl and CD in November 2019 via Audiolith Records, was met with positive reviews and followed by a promotional tour throughout Germany with their own workshops about the feminist scene in Belarus. The band has been featured in a number of international media, from interviews in old-school punk zines to articles in online multilingual projects. In early to mid August of 2020, when the 2020 Belarusian protests escalated following the announcement of falsified election results, two members of the band (first Timofei and then Maryia) were imprisoned by police forces of the authoritarian government for taking part in demonstrations against the regime. However, eventually they were both released after some time in arrest. Band members The band started out as an all- female group, but in late 2018 their drummer Katya left the band and moved out of Grodno to pursue her career. While looking for a new female drummer, Artur Lemantovich from The Goonzz! and Mister X stepped in to help as a temporary drummer for Messed Up.

Research  With Madabhushi as director, the team at Case Western Reserve University‚Äôs Center for Computational Imaging and Personalized Diagnostics (CCIPD) is developing image analysis, statistical pattern recognition, machine learning and artificial intelligence tools to computationally interrogate biomedical image data, including MRI, CAT scans and digital pathology tissue images. The tools can be used to predict disease progression and provide a score to clinicians on the aggressiveness of a patient‚Äôs disease, such as breast cancer and prostate cancer, which can in turn help physicians decide on appropriate treatment options. The impetus for the CCIPD‚Äôs systems-based approach to disease understanding is to diverge from a traditional approach of focusing on a limited number of molecular components to a broader understanding of how numerous interrelated health variables ‚Äì proteomics, metabolites, genomics ‚Äì result in the emergence of definable phenotypes. Work done under Madabhushi‚Äôs guidance has yielded results, including the discovery of computationally-derived image biomarkers that pave the way for disease prognosis and therapeutic response, thereby allowing physicians to predict which treatment and management strategies might be most appropriate. In addition, research on image biomarkers is being applied by the CCIPD group to the field of ‚Äúradiogenomics‚Äù or predicting the mutational status or molecular subtype of a tumor based solely off computational features derived from a routine imaging scan. Dr. Madabhushi‚Äôs team also has pioneered the Ibris (image based risk score), which computes the probability of disease aggressiveness using features mined from medical images for a variety of cancers. Madabhushi‚Äôs research has received grant funding from the National Cancer Institute (NIH), National Science Foundation, the Department of Defense, private foundations and industry.

It emerges as a timely storage solution to bridge the ever-increasing performance gap between the processing speed of the compute nodes and the Input/output (I/O) bandwidth of the storage systems. Burst buffer is built from arrays of high-performance storage devices, such as NVRAM and SSD. It typically offers from one to two orders of magnitude higher I/O bandwidth than the back-end storage systems. Use cases The emergence of burst buffer fosters a wide variety of burst buffer based solutions that accelerate the scientific data movement on supercomputers. For example, scientific applications' life cycles typically alternate between computation phases and I/O phases. Namely, after each round of computation (i.e., computation phase), all the computing processes concurrently write their intermediate data to the back-end storage systems (i.e., I/O phase), followed by another round of computation and data movement operations. With the deployment of burst buffer, processes can quickly write their data to burst buffer after one round of computation instead of writing to the slow hard disk based storage systems, and immediately proceed to the next round of computation without waiting for the data to be moved to the back-end storage systems; the data are then asynchronously flushed from burst buffer to the storage systems at the same time with the next round of computation. In this way, the long I/O time spent in moving data to the storage systems is hidden behind the computation time. In addition, buffering data in burst buffer also gives applications plenty of opportunities to reshape the data traffic to the back-end storage systems for efficient bandwidth utilization of the storage systems. In another common use case, scientific applications can stage their intermediate data in and out of burst buffer without interacting with the slower storage systems. Bypassing the storage systems allows applications to realize most of the performance benefit from burst buffer. Representative burst buffer architectures There are two representative burst buffer architectures in the high-performance computing environment: node-local burst buffer and remote shared burst buffer. In the node-local burst buffer architecture, burst buffer storage is located on the individual compute node, so the aggregate burst buffer bandwidth grows linearly with the compute node count. This scalability benefit has been well- documented in recent literature. It also comes with the demand for a scalable metadata management strategy to maintain a global namespace for data distributed across all the burst buffers. In the remote shared burst buffer architecture, burst buffer storage resides on a fewer number of I/O nodes positioned between the compute nodes and the back-end storage systems. Data movement between the compute nodes and burst buffer needs to go through the network. Placing burst buffer on the I/O nodes facilitates the independent development, deployment and maintenance of the burst buffer service. Hence, several well-known commercialized software products have been developed to manage this type of burst buffer, such as DataWarp and Infinite Memory Engine. As the upcoming supercomputers are going to be deployed with multiple heterogeneous burst buffer layers, such as NVRAM on the compute nodes, and SSDs on the dedicated I/O nodes, there is a growing interest in designing and implementing a unified software solution that transparently moves data across multiple storage layers. Supercomputers deployed with burst buffer Due to its importance, burst buffer has been widely deployed on the leadership-scale supercomputers. For example, node-local burst buffer has been installed on DASH supercomputer at the San Diego Supercomputer Center, Tsubame supercomputers at Tokyo Institute of Technology, Theta and Aurora supercomputers at the Argonne National Laboratory, Summit supercomputer at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and Sierra supercomputer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, etc. Remote shared burst buffer has been adopted by Tianhe-2 supercomputer at the National Supercomputer Center in Guangzhou, Trinity supercomputer at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, Cori supercomputer at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and ARCHER2 supercomputer at Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre.

It was the first fatal accident involving a Tupolev Tu-124.  Aircraft  The aircraft involved in the accident was a Tupolev Tu-124V with two Soloviev D-20P engines, registered SSSR-45028 to the Soviet Union's state airline, Aeroflot. At the time of the accident the aircraft had accumulated 1,612 flight hours and 1,151 pressurization cycles in service.  Crew  Thirty passengers and nine crew members were on board the flight. The crew consisted of the following: * Captain Ivan Kostin * Captain trainee Victor Sjulin * Check captain Pavel Saveliev * Co-pilot Victor Kiryakov * Radio operator Evgeny Ivanov * Flight engineer Alexander Danilov * Navigator Leonid Gostev Stewardesses Zoya Chicherina and Tamara Kolesnikova worked in the cabin. Flight and accident The aircraft was de-iced before takeoff. In the cockpit, the check captain observing the trainee's performance sat on the right; the trainee sat on the left. The captain and first officer remained in the cabin and did not assist the trainee and check captain during takeoff. Flight 513 took off from the runway at a bearing of 100¬∞. At an altitude of 40‚Äì50 meters the angle of attack increased to the point of causing a stall. The Tu-124 never recovered from the stall and crashed into a field of snow. Originally the crew and sixteen passengers died in the crash, but five passengers later died in hospital from their injuries.  Cause  The investigation concluded that the accident was most likely caused by: * Failure of the altitude indicators to display the correct outputs as result of a design flaw in the Tu-124; * Water ingress from de-icing causing the attitude indicator to malfunction. One member of the investigation board disagreed with the conclusions reached, insisting that the accident was caused by pilot error.

Plot Second year high school student and archery enthusiast Hibiki Shimada has never felt romantic love all her life. This comes despite befriending Megumi Chigusa and Kosuke Kawai, two lovestruck teenagers who shamelessly flaunt their feelings for the school's mathematics and visual arts teachers, Masato Sekiya and Sachiko Nakajima, respectively. One day, Hibiki wrongly sends Chigusa's love letter for Sekiya to Kosaku Ito, the school's history teacher. Volunteering to take it back, she ends up becoming attracted to him. Days after their meeting, Hibiki is further fascinated by Ito's kindness, as he is well-known among the school as a stern and cold person. Ito takes Hibiki to a hospital when he spots her limping with a wounded leg, helps her finish an assignment after hours, and frequently gives her a ride home. Meanwhile, Chigusa quietly drops her romantic pursuit when she finds out that Sekiya is in love with Nakajima. However, Hibiki and Kosuke learn shortly after that Nakajima is in love with Ito when they overhear her confession to Ito, who rejects her. Eventually, Hibiki professes her love to Ito before the finals. She makes a deal with him: if she manages to score over 90 in the history test, he will allow her to love him. Along the way, Hibiki is discouraged from reaching her goal by Nakajima and Ito himself. She regains her spirit after a pep talk with Yusuke Fujioka, an archery student from a neighboring school. Her efforts bear fruit when the test results are out. During the cultural festival, she approaches Ito in a wedding dress and pledges that she will love him forever. Unexpectedly, Ito kisses her. The next day, words of the kiss spread among the school. Hibiki is suspended, while Ito is called for disciplinary action. When the two meet later, Ito decides to end their relationship. Dejectedly walking home, Hibiki is comforted by Fujioka, who confesses his feelings for her. The result of the disciplinary meeting is announced the next day: Ito will leave his post. As she is still suspended, Hibiki does not learn about it until Chigusa hurriedly goes to her home and pleads her to meet with him one last time. Kosuke, angry at Ito's halfheartedness, gives him a tongue lashing about abandoning Hibiki, asking him whether the words he said at the disciplinary meeting ‚Äî that he sincerely loves Hibiki ‚Äî were lies. Each encouraged, Hibiki and Ito race for a final meeting, where Ito promises to wait until Hibiki's graduation for them to begin a relationship. Around one and a half year later, Hibiki graduates. Chigusa has found love in an underclassman, while Kosuke is still attempting to woo Nakajima, this time as an adult. As she is walking home, Hibiki is greeted by Ito. They hold hands and Hibiki comments on the size and warmth of his hands. They share a final kiss and this is how the film ends.

It is often much higher than what current real materials can achieve. The lowered fracture stress is due to defects, such as interior or surface cracks. One of the goals for the study of mechanical properties of materials is to design and fabricate materials exhibiting strength close to the theoretical limit.  Definition  When a solid is in tension, its atomic bonds stretch, elastically. Once a critical strain is reached, all the atomic bonds on the fracture plane ruptures and the material mechanically fails. The stress at which the solid fractures is the theoretical strength, often denoted as \\\\sigma_{th}. After fracture, the stretched atomic bonds return to its initial state, except that two surfaces has formed. The theoretical strength is often approximated as: :\\\\sigma_{th} \\\\cong \\\\frac{E}{10} where *\\\\sigma_{th} is the maximum theoretical stress the solid can withstand. * E is the Young's Modulus of the solid.  Derivation  The stress-displacement, or \\\\sigma vs x, relationship during fracture can be approximated by a sine curve, \\\\sigma = \\\\sigma_{th} sin(2\\\\pi x/\\\\lambda), up to \\\\lambda/4. The initial slope of the \\\\sigma vs x curve can be related to Young's modulus through the following relationship: :\\\\left (\\\\frac{d\\\\sigma}{dx} \\\\right )_{x=0} = \\\\left (\\\\frac{d\\\\sigma}{d\\\\epsilon} \\\\right )_{x=0} \\\\left (\\\\frac{d\\\\epsilon}{dx} \\\\right )_{x=0} = E\\\\left (\\\\frac{d\\\\epsilon}{dx} \\\\right )_{x=0} where *\\\\sigma is the stress applied. * E is the Young's Modulus of the solid. * \\\\epsilon is the strain experienced by the solid. * x is the displacement. The strain \\\\epsilon can be related to the displacement x by \\\\epsilon = x/a_0, and a_0 is the equilibrium inter-atomic spacing. The strain derivative is therefore given by \\\\left (\\\\frac{d\\\\epsilon}{dx} \\\\right)_{x=0} = 1/a_0 The relationship of initial slope of the \\\\sigma vs x curve with Young's modulus thus becomes :\\\\left (\\\\frac{d\\\\sigma}{dx} \\\\right )_{x=0} = E/a_0 The sinusoidal relationship of stress and displacement gives a derivative: :\\\\left (\\\\frac{d\\\\sigma}{dx} \\\\right ) = \\\\left (\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\lambda} \\\\right ) \\\\sigma_{th} cos\\\\left (\\\\frac{2\\\\pi x}{\\\\lambda} \\\\right ) = \\\\left (\\\\frac{2\\\\pi \\\\sigma}{\\\\lambda} \\\\right )_{x\\\\rightarrow0} By setting the two d\\\\sigma/dx together, the theoretical strength becomes: :\\\\sigma_{th} = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda E}{2\\\\pi a_0} \\\\cong \\\\frac{E}{2\\\\pi} \\\\cong \\\\frac{E}{10} The theoretical strength can also be approximated using the fracture work per unit area, which result in slightly different numbers. However, the above derivation and final approximation is a commonly used metric for evaluating the advantages of a material's mechanical properties.

Publication history * The first edition of DLB, designed by Chuck McGrew, was published by Mind Ventures in 1994 as a 158-page book. The book included rules and two sample adventures. * A second edition was published in 1995 as a 208-page softcover book. The horror theme was given a more light-hearted tone. * A 96-page supplement which included additional source material and an adventure called Giant Psychic Insects from Outer Space was also published in 1995. Gameplay =First edition= Don't Look Back is set in a world full of conspiracies and unexplained phenomena. Players take on the roles of agents working for a secret government agency investigating supernatural and paranormal events. Players begin by creating a character with six abilities and about ten skills. Each of a character's abilities and skills has a rating from +5 to -5, with 0 representing an average ability or skill. Skill checks are done by rolling at least three six-sided dice, with a roll of 11‚Äì18 always a success, and a roll of 10 or less always a failure. The total number of dice the player throws is calculated as 3 plus the absolute value of the sum of bonuses or penalties from the most relevant ability, most relevant skill, and the difficulty of the task. If the Base Total of those three factors is above zero, the player totals the three highest dice. If the Base Total is negative, then the player uses the result of the lowest three dice. For example, two characters want to scale a wall that has a difficulty of -2: * The first character has a -1 Fitness ability and +5 Climbing skill. These combined with the wall's difficulty of -2 gives a Base Total of +2. The absolute value of 2 is added to 3 resulting in a total number of dice to be thrown of 5. Because the Base Total of ability + skill + difficulty was above zero, the player would use the result of the three highest dice to determine success or failure. * The second character has a +1 Fitness ability and +0 Climbing skill. These combined with the wall's difficulty of -2 gives a Base Total of -1. The absolute value of 1 is added to 3 resulting in a total number of dice to be thrown of 4. Because the Base Total of ability + skill + difficulty was below zero, the player would use the result of the three lowest dice. The same single roll system is used in combat. An attacker determines how many dice to throw; if successful, the number of points of damage is calculated as the dice total minus 10, the sum then multiplied by the weapon's damage modifier and any resistance modifier of the defender. =Second edition= In the second edition, a more light-hearted approach is taken to the horror theme. Characters are now ordinary citizens who are pulled into investigating unusual events by circumstances. Characters have seven abilities, with ratings from +4 to -4. Depending on the character's background, the character also receives a number of acquired abilities. The player can spend a fixed number of points on either improving abilities or acquiring additional abilities. The player can also spend points on buying Advantages such as Ambidexterity; and receive a refund of points for buying Disadvantages such as Gullible. There is no limit to the number of Advantages and Disadvantages that can be purchased, as long as the total expenditure of points is zero. The skill check resolution system is identical to the first edition except that the final result of the dice roll is checked against a Quality Table to resolve the attempt, which can be anything from Horrible Failure to Incredible Success. The gamemaster then adjudicates what happens as a result. The combat system uses the same single dice roll system to determine success or failure; resultant damage is calculated by multiplying the action's Quality Rating with the relevant Defense Scale factor. The result is rounded down, resulting in the amount of damage applied. Reception In the August 1995 edition of Dragon (Issue 220), Lester Smith thought the character generation system of the first edition was \\"quick and simple\\", action checks \\"easy to adjudicate\\", and \\"the adventures were truly spooky.\\" But Smith thought the artwork was \\"sophomoric.\\" He concluded on a positive note by giving the game an above average rating of 5 out of 6, saying, \\"Overall, this is an applaudable first product by a new company.\\" Paul Pettengale reviewed the 2nd edition of Don't Look Back: Terror is Never Far Behind for Arcane magazine, rating it an 8 out of 10 overall. Pettengale comments that \\"I think Don't Look Back is a superb RPG. The subject matter offers flexibility in terms of gaming style (ranging from dark and brooding through vaguely sinister to downright farcical), and the implementation of the system is a breeze.\\" In the June 1996 edition of Dragon (Issue 230), Rick Swan thought the second edition was \\"not only pretty good, but pretty easy. And pretty funny.\\" Swan liked the fast-paced skill resolution system, but found the math-oriented combat system incompatible with the general tenor of the game. \\"Though it generates acceptable results, a less math-heavy system would‚Äôve been a better fit with a game this goofy.\\" Swan didn't think there was enough new material for owners of the first edition to buy the second edition, but gave it a rating of 4 out of 6 and recommended it for new players, saying, \\"Don‚Äôt Look Back may not be a groundbreaker, but it‚Äôs fast-paced, clever, and loaded with goodies.\\" In a 1996 reader poll conducted by Arcane to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time, Don't Look Back was ranked 42nd. Editor Paul Pettengale commented: \\"This was, until the release of Conspiracy X earlier this year, the best of the modern day horror/conspiracy systems. The actual mechanics are a tad clunky, but the world background and the way that the authors set the scene means that no ref can fail but to come up with dozens of classic campaign adventures.\\" References Category:Horror role-playing games Category:Role-playing games introduced in 1994 ","title":"Don't Look Back (role-playing game)"},{"id":"54089012","text":"Biting Fly is a 2017 South Korean crime drama film directed by Ahn Cheol-ho.

It is endemic to New Zealand. Discovery and taxonomy Graphania averilla was first described by George Hudson in 1921 under the name Melanchra averill. The moth was discovered by Averil Lysaght in December 1920 on Mount Egmont. Alfred Philpott also described this species in 1924 under the name Melanchra furtiva from specimens collected around Mount Arthur as well as in the mountainous areas near Lake Wakatipu. In 1988 John S. Dugdale placed this species within the genus Graphania and recognised Melanchra furtiva as a new synonym. Description Graphania averilla is a medium sized moth. The forewings of this species are pinkish brown coloured, tinged with grey and have dark markings with a notable streak running lengthwise from the forewing base. There is also a distinctive v-shaped dark mark on the posterior corner of the wing. The hind wings of this species are greyish brown in colour. Distribution Graphania averilla inhabits mountainous country and has been collected on Mount Egmont, Mount Arthur, around Ben Lomond, Elfin Bay, Lake Luna and Lake MacKenzie in Otago, and at the Cass Basin in the Waimakariri River catchment. The adult moths can be found on the wing in November and December, and have also been recorded in January and February. Host plants The larvae of Graphania averilla have been found to feed on the Plantago genus of plants.

The total number of homeless people in the United States fluctuates and constantly changes hence a comprehensive figure encompassing the entire nation is not issued since counts from independent shelter providers and statistics managed by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development vary greatly. Federal HUD counts hover annually at around 500,000 people. Point-in-time counts are also vague measures of homeless populations and are not a precise and definitive indicator for the total number of cases, which may differ in both directions up or down . The most recent figure for the year 2019 that was given was at 567,715 individuals across the country that have experienced homelessness at a point in time during this period.https://endhomelessness.org/homelessness-in-america/homelessness- statistics/faqs/ Homeless people may use shelters, or may sleep in cars, tents, on couches, or in other public places. Separate counts of sheltered people and unsheltered people are critical in understanding the homeless population. Each state has different laws, social services and medical policies, and other conditions which influence the number of homeless persons, and what services are available to homeless people in each state. The state by state counts of people listed below are derived from under-reported federal HUD statistics. Alaska Mental illness in Alaska is a current epidemic that the state struggles to maintain. The United States Inter agency Council on Homelessness (2018) stated that as of January 2018, Alaska had an estimated 2,016 citizens experiencing homelessness on any given day while around 3,784 public school students experienced homelessness over the course of the year as well. Within that niche group, an average of 25-28% of these homeless are either moderately or severely affected by mental illness, according to Torrey (2018) with the Mental Illness Policy Organization on studies done in 2015. Currently, At the state's flagship Alaska Psychiatric Institute, almost half the rooms are empty, a problem that has persisted for several years (Anchorage Daily News. 2018). Not only to assess the situation of each individual physically and mentally, but to also consider the social disparity that they may also have issues with. Financially, having money problems is a stressful situation to any ‚Äònormal‚Äô individual, but to have financial troubles as someone with mental illnesses could be nearly life-threatening. Trying to find capable staff to handle the needs of the homeless mentally ill, when they are sent in for processing in the Alaska Jail system to keep them off of the streets, is hard to come by due to budgetary issues and finding the workforce for this field. Alabama Although throughout the United States panhandling is discouraged, passive panhandling falls under First Amendment rights to free speech. In Alabama the prohibition of aggressive panhandling and regulation of passive panhandling is controlled by individual cities, with many panhandlers being charged with loitering offences. Loitering for the purposes of begging and prostitution in Alabama is a criminal offense. An issue for Alabamians is the proportion of panhandlers defined as vagrants, who contrary to their implications, are not homeless but accept the generosity of the community under this false pretense. As the cities decide ordinances for the control of panhandling, there is a variety of methods used across the state depending on the issues in each city. Many cities such as Mobile, Alabama have introduced a set of ordinances to prohibit panhandling in the \\"Downtown Visitors Domain\\" area, as well regulations for panhandlers in the rest of the city including disallowing; panhandling at night, physical contact while panhandling, panhandling in groups, and approaching those in queues or traffic. These ordinances are an improvement on the previously vague prohibition of \\"begging\\". For those soliciting donations for charitable organizations, a permit must be obtained for the fundraising operation to be exempt from panhandling ordinances. Panhandling in the Downtown Visitors Domain may result in fines and jail sentences for those involved. Another effort to limit panhandling in Mobile is an initiative using donation meters through which people can donate money to approved charities in attempts to resolve the necessity of panhandling by providing disadvantaged citizens with resources. This method attempts to lessen the recurring arrest and release of the publicly intoxicated, who are often homeless or vagrant and participate in panhandling. An important concern for those in Alabama's capital city, Montgomery, is those who travel from other cities to panhandle, with a police report from November 2016 showing that most panhandlers in the area had travelled to the city for the purposes of begging. In the city of Daphne, panhandling is prohibited within 25 feet of public roadways and violators are subject to fines, while the cities of Gardendale and Vestavia Hills prevent all forms of panhandling on private and public property. The city of Tuscaloosa prohibits all aggressive panhandling, as well as passive panhandling near banks and ATMs, towards people in parked or stopped vehicles and at public transport facilities. Alabama's most populous city, Birmingham has considered limitations on panhandling that disallow solicitation near banks and ATMs, with fines for infractions such as aggressive or intimidating behaviour. Another concern for Birmingham is litter left behind in popular panhandling sites, especially for business owners in the downtown area. In Birmingham, specifically asking for money is considered illegal panhandling. The City Action Partnership (CAP) of Birmingham encourages civilians to report and discourage panhandlers throughout the city, especially under unlawful circumstances including panhandling using children, aggression, false information and panhandling while loitering as prohibited by City Ordinances. Within the city of Opelika it is considered a misdemeanour to present false or misleading information while panhandling, and there are requirements for panhandlers to possess a panhandling permit. Threatening behaviours towards those solicited to are also considered misdemeanours and include; being too close, blocking the path of those approached, or panhandling in groups of two or more persons. Those previously charged with these offences in Opelika are not eligible for a panhandling permit within set time limits. The city of Flagstaff took the policy a step further by implementing a practice of arresting, jailing and prosecuting individuals who are beg for money or food. In February 2013, Marlene Baldwin, a woman in her late 70s was arrested and jailed for asking a plain clothed officer for $1.25. Between June 2012 and May 2013 135 individuals were arrested under the law. However, after criticism and a lawsuit from The American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona the policy was deemed unconstitutional as it breached free speech rights granted by both federal and state constitutions. In his judgement, Judge Neil V. Wake declared the A.R.S 13-2905(a)(3) was void and prohibited any practices the city of Flagstaff has implemented that \\" interferes with, targets, cites, arrests, or prosecutes any person on the basis of their act(s) of peaceful begging in public areas.\\" Despite this, the state of Arizona continued to pursue other ways to criminalize panhandling. Their response to Judge Wake's judgment was to criminalize \\"aggressive panhandling. The bill that passed into law in 2015 prohibits individuals from asking for money within 15-feet of an ATM or bank without prior permission from the property owner. Furthermore, it prohibits \\"following the person being solicited in a manner that is intended or likely to cause a reasonable person to fear imminent bodily harm,\\" or \\"obstructing the safe or free passage of the person being solicited.\\" Moreover, the city of Chandler has proposed a new bill that prevents panhandling along city streets justifying the law by citing safety concerns. The proposed laws would make it a civil traffic offence for an individual to be at a median strip for any purposes other than crossing the road. Under the proposed law, the first violation would be treated as a civil traffic offence; however, a second violation within 24 months would be treated as a Class 1 misdemeanor citation in which an individual could be fined a maximum of $2500 and face up to six months in jail. The State of Arizona continues to seek measures that would both limit panhandling but also satisfy the judgement made by Judge Neil V. Wake and the First Amendment. Arkansas In 2015, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development released a report detailing the decline of homelessness in Arkansas, but that the level of homeless veterans had increased. They found that 2,560 people were homeless in Arkansas in January 2015, and that 207 were veterans, an 83% increase in veteran homelessness since January 2009. Arkansas is one of only five states to have seen homelessness among veterans to increase by more than 100 people in that time. Of those five states, Arkansas had the largest number of homeless veterans. This is compared to nationwide, where homelessness among veterans has decreased by 35% since 2009.Arkansas News Little Rock, November 22, 2015. Retrieved on December 20, 2016. As of 2015, it was estimated that 1,334 of the homeless in Arkansas are youths. In Arkansas, the most common causes of homelessness are income issues and personal relationships. The median time spent homeless is 12 months, however 30% have been homeless for over two years.Fitzpatrick, Kevin M., Collier, Stephanie & O'Connor, Gail University of Arkansas, 2015.

The American Civil Liberties Union filed the case on behalf of Michael Rodgers, a disabled veteran, and Glynn Dilbeck, a homeless man who was arrested for holding up a sign asking for money to cover his daughter's medical expenses. ACLU were successful in their challenge, meaning that law enforcement officers will be prohibited from arresting or issuing citations to people for begging or panhandling.Meyers, Shawna Little Rock, November 22, 2016. Retrieved December 21, 2016. The loitering law has had a history of being abused by police officers in the state of Arkansas. For example, two homeless men reported separate incidents of having been kicked out of Little Rock Bus Station by police officers. Despite showing valid tickets that showed that their bus would arrive within 30 minutes, they were told they could not wait on the premises because they were loitering. In another incident, police officers told homeless people to leave a free public event or be subject to arrest for loitering in a park, although vendors at the event had encouraged the homeless to attend and take free samples of their merchandise. In 2005, police assembled an undercover taskforce to crack down on panhandling in the downtown Little Rock area, arresting 41 people. 72% of the homeless report ever being arrested. California (by major counties) California Governor Gavin Newsom speaks about homelessness and federal support in 2019. A tent city at Oakland California (E. 12th Street) set up by local homeless people. Homeless man in Fresno, California. California in 2017 had an oversized share of the nation's homeless: 22%, for a state whose residents make up only 12% of the country's total population. The California State Auditor found in their April 2018 report Homelessness in California, that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development noted that \\"California had about 134,000 homeless individuals, which represented about 24 percent of the total homeless population in the nation‚Äù The California State Auditor is an independent government agency responsible for analyzing California economic activities and then issuing reports. The Sacramento Bee notes that large cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco both attribute their increases in homeless to the housing shortage. In 2017, homeless persons in California numbered 135,000 (a 15% increase from 2015). Homelessness has been an ongoing issue in the United States since the Industrial Revolution and is a major concern for contemporary U.S society. The state of California has one of the highest concentrations of homelessness in the United States. As agricultural migrations have occurred and with urbanization spreading, empirical research and data analysis will be pivotal in understanding the major causes of homelessness. In order to determine solutions to mitigate and minimize homelessness, sociologist, non- governmental agencies (NGO's), and federal and state government agencies will need to work collectively to collaborate on curbing homelessness, not only in the state of California but throughout the entire United States. Current research has proven that people entering homelessness after the age of fifty, become homeless for environmental purposes rather than mental illness and substance abuse. As the baby boomer generation retires and housing costs and financial crisis become more rampant and prevalent, understanding the difference between environmental causes versus traditional causes such as mental illness and drug addiction will be necessary. According to Individuals who first became homeless before age 50 had a higher prevalence of recent mental health and substance use problems and more difficulty performing instrumental activities of daily living (p. 1)‚Äù. Thus, education and compassion training will be extremely important, especially for Gen X and Gen Y, in order to understand reasonings behind homelessness and creating solutions. In addition, housing programs and civic engagement will be extremely important and necessary as well.Brown, R. T., Goodman, L., Guzman, D., Tieu, L., Ponath, C., & Kushel, M. B. (2016). Pathways to Homelessness among Older Homeless Adults: Results from the HOPE HOME Study. PLoS ONE, 11(5), 1‚Äì17. The United States Interagency Council on Homelessness estimated that there were over 129 thousand homeless people on any given day in California in 2018. This is less than 1% of the total population, but far more than any other state in the union. Factors that contribute to homelessness are mental health, addiction, tragic life occurrences, as well as poverty, job loss and affordable housing. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition (2018), there is no state that has an adequate supply of affordable housing. California has been identified as having only 22 homes for every 100 (nlihc.org) of the lowest income renters, putting the housing shortage in California at over 1 million homes. While programs to help the homeless do exist at the city, county, state and federal levels, programs alone do not end homelessness; providing permanent affordable housing is required. Former state Assemblyman Mike Gatto proposed in a 2018 opinion piece that a new form of detention be created as a method to force drug addicted and mentally ill homeless persons (which make up two-thirds of California's homeless population) off the streets and into treatment, as well as to lengthen the jail terms for misdemeanors. As the number of homelessness people increased, the problem emerged as a major issue during the governor's race in 2018. Shortage in affordable housing contributes to the increasing numbers of homelessness as well as assisted and support programs to help this population maintain a course of action towards improvement. CALmatters, 2018, addresses three stages of homelessness as: ‚ÄúChronic, Transitional, and Episodic.‚Äù It was reported in The Atlantic in March 2019 that outbreaks of \\"Medieval diseases\\" such as tuberculosis and typhus are spreading in homeless shelters throughout California. These outbreaks have been described as a \\"public-health crisis\\" and a \\"disaster\\" by public health officials who are concerned they might spread into the general population. The extent of the homelessness in California has been linked to increased visibility of individuals without any form of shelter in the 1980s. Some scholars have attributed to the rise of the crack epidemic in the 1980s while others attribute this to a lack of affordable housing becoming more prevalent in the 1980s as well. =Los Angeles= Tents of the homeless on the sidewalk in Skid Row, Los Angeles, 2018 In June 2019, Los Angeles County officials reported over 58,000 homeless in the county. In its January 2013 census, the county counted 39,463 people sleeping on the street or in homeless shelters. When including persons sleeping on private property with permission to stay no more than 90 days, the total estimated number of homeless in Los Angeles County was 57,737 in 2013. The number of people in the latter category, called \\"precariously housed\\" or \\"at risk of homelessness\\", was estimated by means of a telephone survey. The number of homeless in Los Angeles County, including the precariously housed and at risk of homelessness, was 51,340 in 2011, of which 23,539 were in the City of Los Angeles, and 4,316 were in the 50 block area east of downtown Los Angeles known as Skid Row. It is estimated that 190,207 people are homeless in Los Angeles County at least one night during the year. The 2013 census notes that 31.4% of the homeless in Los Angeles County are substance abusers, 30.2% are mentally ill, and 18.2% have a physical disability. The census also notes that 68.2% of the homeless are male, 38% are African American, 37% are Caucasian, 28% are Hispanic, and 57.6% are between 25 and 54 years old. By 2015, there were an estimated 44 thousand homeless living in Los Angeles. Homelessness jumped to a record level of more than 55,000 people living in shelters and on the streets in May 2017. On a given night, about 12,934 homeless people stay in a shelter. The Board of Supervisors of Los Angeles County wrote to the State Legislature asking that the California \\"pass a resolution urging the Governor to declare a state of emergency with respect to homelessness\\" in June 2016. California governor Gavin Newsom fulfilled this request. Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas in an opinion piece said that homelessness has reached emergency levels in Los Angeles County, with over 900 people dying on the streets in 2018, and over a thousand projected to die in 2019. Exposure to the elements cuts the lifespan of those who survive on the streets by 20 years. He attributes the crisis to rising rents, lack of affordable housing, and stagnant wages. There are an estimated 4,021 homeless young-adults between the ages of 18 and 24 on any given night in Los Angeles County as of 2019, a 22% increase over 2018, per the Greater Los Angeles Youth Homeless Count (LA Youth Count). The count defines youth as people 24 years old and younger. Los Angeles spent $619 million on the 36,000 homeless in 2019, approximately $17,194 per homeless person, however homelessness numbers continue to grow. Peter Lynn, head of the Los Angeles Homeless Service Authority (LAHSA) who saw homelessness rise 33% during his five years in spite of $780 million in additional funding, resigned his job at the end of 2019.  City of Los Angeles  According to a 2019 Los Angeles Times poll, 95% of voters called homelessness a serious or very serious problem in the city, more than for any other issue. L.A. County officials reported that in 2019 there were over 39,000 homeless in the city. The Los Angeles Police Department has used citations and fines towards individuals living in public areas as part of the Safer Cities Initiative that began in September 2006. This Central Police division's initiative entailed assigning fifty full-time officers to clearing out \\"homeless encampments\\" to different parts of downtown. Once these areas were cleared, they would stay for seven days before moving on to another area. In 2015, the city was spending roughly $100 million a year on homelessness with approximately half of this funding going to policing the homeless population. Proposition HHH was approved by voters 77% to 23% in 2016. This was a $1.2 billion bond measure to build permanent supportive housing for homeless people and people at risk of becoming homeless.City Clerk for the City of Los Angeles: Measure HHH, October 29, 2016 Rising rent and relatively few laws protecting tenants from predatory landlords are significant drivers of surging homelessness in Los Angeles.  City of Santa Monica  Santa Monica experienced a homelessness decrease of 19% downtown with a 3% increase in overall homelessness for 2019. Positive results are credited to outreach and engagement strategies and to prioritizing homelessness, cited as a Top 10 Santa Monica Story of 2019 which reported on \\"In the Image\\", a statue of a homeless man installed in downtown Santa Monica. Rising homeless numbers are attributed to the Los Angeles housing crisis. Santa Monica has approximately 400 emergency shelter beds across 330 permanent supportive housing (PSH) units, and provides an access center for showering, mail, and medical. =Orange= The 2019 Orange County Point in Time count documented 6,860 homeless people. Per the count, 2,899 homeless had found some type of shelter, while 3,961 had no shelter. The Point in Time count is a federally required biennial census of the homeless to collect demographic data and other information which also determines how much federal funding Orange County will receive to address homelessness issues. A 2017 census in Orange County, California recorded 4,792 homeless individuals. 193 homeless individuals died in 2017, with drug overdoses and suicides among the population being the leading cause of death. =San Diego= A 2017 count showed 9,100 homeless people throughout San Diego County. Veterans make up a significant portion of this population, with 1,300 homeless veterans. A Hepatitis A outbreak in November 2017 resulted in a declaration of a health emergency, which affected the homeless population due to inadequate sanitation. In response to the health crisis, San Diego opened three emergency shelters which are expected to have an annual cost of $12.9 million to operate. The city approved a 500-bin storage center for homeless people to store their belongings. San Diego has a history of insufficient healthcare provided to the homeless population, with a majority of the homeless population in 1989 lacking any regular access to healthcare. San Diego's homeless population has fallen in recent years, but still remains the 4th largest in the United States with 8,576 homeless in 2019. The large count of homeless is juxtaposed by the existence of over 30,000 vacant housing units. San Diego has taken action to alleviate the homeless population living on the streets by encouraging housing within vehicles. In February 2019, San Diego repealed a long-standing law which made living within vehicles illegal. This comes two years after the construction of a parking lot designed to provide safe residence for the homeless who live in their cars, complete with restroom and shower facilities. The City of San Diego currently has 2,040 emergency and bridge shelters for the homeless, providing temporary housing options. The City of San Diego adopted a 'Housing First' program in 2018, which plans 79.7 million dollars in programs assisting the homeless. These programs include temporary housing development, permanent housing development, rent assistance, and incentives for landlords to rent to the homeless. = Sacramento= In August 2019, it was estimated that there are over 5,000 drug addict transients and vagrants in Sacramento. The same month, the city of Sacramento filed a lawsuit against seven transients accused of theft, drugs, assaults and having weapons. The lawsuit seeks to exclude them from the business corridor around Land Park and Curtis Park. =San Francisco= A homeless camp in San Francisco, 2017 The city of San Francisco, California has a significant and visible homeless problem. Approximately 61% of the homeless population were already living and working in San Francisco when they became homeless, indicating that a majority of people experiencing homelessness did not come to the city for its resources but rather are being priced out of their home. The city's homeless population has been estimated at 7,000‚Äì10,000 people, of which approximately 3,000‚Äì5,000 refuse shelter due to the conditions within the shelters including violence, racism, and homophobia and transphobia. Additionally, there are only 1,339 available shelter beds for the approximately 10,000 people sleeping outdoors. The city spends $200 million a year on homelessness related programs. On May 3, 2004, San Francisco officially began an attempt to scale back the scope of its homelessness problem by changing its strategy from cash payments to the \\"Care Not Cash\\" plan which has had no visible impact on reducing homelessness in the city. In 2010, a city ordinance was passed to disallow sitting and lying down on public sidewalks for most of the day. An October 2018 report by Leilani Farha, the UN's Special Rapporteur on the Right to Adequate Housing, said that \\"cruel and inhuman\\" conditions for homeless people in the Bay Area violate human rights, which include being denied \\"access to water, sanitation and health services, and other basic necessities.\\" Farha's fact finding mission found conditions in homeless encampments rivaling the most impoverished neighborhoods in Mumbai, Delhi and Mexico City. She urged the Bay Area to provide more affordable housing. Currently there is a proposition on the Nov 2018 elections ballot (Proposition C), if passed, it would apply tax to the gross receipts of San Francisco's largest companies. The revenue from the tax would add up to $300 million a year to the city's homeless budget (double what it is right now). It would also fund shelters, mental health services, addiction treatment, and prevention to keep people from becoming homeless. =Santa Barbara= The rising cost of rent and property prices has forced hundreds of middle-class people, including teachers, chefs and nurses, to live out of their cars in parking lots. In 2017 a count showed 1,489 homeless individuals. There were 44 deaths in 2016. = Ventura = A preliminary 2018 count released by the Ventura County Continuum of Care Alliance board indicated that the county's population of homeless men, women, and children was 1,299. It was also reported that there was an increase of 24% for the unsheltered population. Overall, in 2017, the City of Ventura experienced a double-digit increase in its homeless population from 2016 and 63 deaths. In recent years, Ventura residents have placed pressure on city leaders to do more about the growing homeless problem. Colorado Colorado Supreme Court Building To be homeless means that an individual or even a family is living in a place not meant for human habitation, in an emergency shelter, in transitional housing or are exiting an institution where they temporarily resided. Homelessness is a growing problem in the State of Colorado and is considered the most important social determinants of health (State of Colorado). Every individual deserves to live in good conditions and have their own home based on rights for housing. Some people do not realize that homelessness is very difficult for many individuals to escape with the continuous increase in costs for housing in Colorado along with mental health treatments and other factors. When people are forced to live without stable shelter they are then exposed to a number of risk factors that affect physical and mental health (State of Colorado). Although it is difficult to pin point any one cause of homelessness, there is a complicated combination of societal and individual causes. With the hard work of community organizations along with some helpful state initiatives, one would believe that homelessness can be escaped and even prevented. While he was Mayor of Denver, Colorado, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper made dealing with the issues that underlie homelessness a top priority on his agenda, speaking heavily on the issue during his first \\"State of the City\\" address in 2003. While Denver's homeless population is much lower than other major cities, the homeless residents have often suffered when without shelter during the cold winters. In 2006, officials said that this number had risen over the past few years. Some findings of the factors contributing to homelessness involve many issues. Among them was factual data about the number of residents that have moved to Colorado since 2011, totaling nearly 650 thousand.(United States Census Bureau, n.d) This influx of residents has caused a shortage in affordable housing and contributed to the price of homeownership and renting to increase yearly. The costs have become so expensive that a person has to make nearly four times the states minimum wage to afford a medium-priced rental. This model is unsustainable per the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, [USICH], (2014) which describes rent as being considered affordable if it is less than thirty percent of total monthly income. Another factor, is the perception that most people are homeless due to their own actions. While this may be true for a rare few, the majority are reluctant to seek services that could help better their situation due to fear of discrimination. Research conducted by,Johnston, Jetten, Dingle, Parsell and Walter (2016) shows that the homeless population are perceived as less than human and are not worthy of support or assistance, often they face contempt and prejudice amongst fellow homeless and the community. This is contributing to the perpetuation of chronic homelessness as people are too afraid to seek assistance and support. A third factor identified, is in how the cities are handling this demographic. There have been 350 \\"anti-homeless‚Äù ordinances enacted, which criminalize daily survival necessities of the homeless, but criminalizing these behaviors fails to mitigate the root causes, and maintains conditions that keep people homeless.(Ruan, 2018) While the cities have enacted these ordinances to combat hazards associated with the homeless such as fires, trash, crime and tent cities, it creates a revolving door of street to jail, jail to street. Research has also indicated a vast shortage in shelter capabilities and resources. The number of homeless people, which in 2018 was nearly eleven thousand, consisted of families, veterans and chronically homeless.(USICH, n.d) According to,Ruan (2018) Denver, the state's capitol, can shelter less than ten percent of its homeless population, and other cities advertise their lack of shelters and resources in an effort to deter people from going to those cities. This means that people are forced to seek shelter wherever available and is usually in violation of one of the city ordinances, like the no camping ban. During the winter months shelters are on a first-come, first- served basis, and people are often waiting for hours in the cold for the doors to open. This is especially challenging for those trying to work because if they are not in line at a certain time, they will likely not get shelter that evening. There are simply not enough shelters or resources to handle the entire homeless demographic, and too many limitations on getting into a shelter for the evening. This creates another burden on resources, accountable care organizations (ACO's) conducted research and found that housing needs had to be addressed before a person could effectively engage in medical treatment, and by addressing this issue first, medical cost were reduced by 53%.(Fraze, Lewis, Rodriguez and Fisher, 2016) Therefore, addressing housing needs can reduce medical treatment and further strain on resources. The research conducted has given great insight into the immense challenges the state and its homeless residents face. There are numerous factors contributing to homelessness, both individually and partially because of the cities themselves. The lack of shelters and strain on resources, contributes to the limited progress of addressing this issue. In order to make a significant impact, the state can adopt multiple new methods that were proven effective in other places to help curb the demographic much faster In April 2012, Denver enacted the Urban Camping Ban due to the occupy Denver protest and the number of homeless on the 16th Street Mall. The ordinance was developed because businesses and individuals in Denver complained to the Mayor's office and City Council that the number of people who were sleeping in front of their business doorways and this was disruptive and made it uncomfortable for individuals to enter their businesses. In addition, Occupy Denver had taken over public space near the capital building in Denver and it became a homeless compound consisting of tents and other structures. The pressure to clean up Denver by businesses and other individuals on the Councilman Albus Brooks sponsored the legislation. Mayor Michael Hancock and City Council passed the urban camping ban which prohibited individuals from sleeping in public places with a blanket over them or something between them and the ground. Those who enact these laws often state it is the tool needed to encourage those who are not accessing services to find ways to address the issues that caused them to be homeless. The Civil Liberties Union wrote a strong letter in opposition to the Denver ordinance. The number of homeless peoples increased from 2016 to 2017 by 1,121 Henry, M., Watt, R., Rosenthal, L., Shivji, A., & Associates A. (Dec. 2017).

C. (May 17, 2018). Final Fiscal Note. Right to rest act. Denver, Colorado, United States: Nonpartisan Services for Colorado's Legislature Many in the homeless population of Colorado have mental health issues that directly relate to their homelessness. There is a shortage in Denver of mental health services for homeless people. The most common mental health issues among the homeless include depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.Jervis, R. (August 28, 2014). Mental Disorders Keep Thousands of Homeless On Streets. , from https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/27/mental-health-homeless- series/14255283/ Therapy sessions, psychiatric hospitals, rehabilitation facilities, and prescription drugs are the most common mental health treatment options for the public. However, the homeless are unable to afford them. There are organizations who strive to help the homeless by providing food, shelter, and clothes, but there are currently not many organizations focused only on improving the mental health in the homeless community of Denver. Housing the homeless has been proven to help reduce homelessness, but that does not solve the mental health issue that a lot of homeless people possess. If organizations adopt a new program to house the homeless, get them counseling, and then help them get a job and food on the table, this will enhance their quality of life and their recovery process. Thee effects of mental health and the number of homeless people with mental health issues would be drastically diminished through programs of this nature. Organizations currently use government funding, grants from private companies, and donations. New and more dynamic services for the homeless affected by mental health could be paid for in the same way. Those that oppose more dynamic mental health services for the homeless often rely on their own opinions rather than on facts such as \\"the more help the homeless get, the more likely they are to get back on their feet and succeed\\".Webster, P. (December 9, 2017). Treatment and Recovery Are Not Optional in Solving Homelessness. from http://solutionsforchange.org/treatment-recovery-not-optional-solving- homelessness/ The homeless population over the last four years within the state of Colorado has remained fairly constant. However, this does not mean that this is not an issue that needs to be addressed. This is because while the overall population has remained stagnant the number of people who are choosing to be unsheltered is actually increasing steadily. Why the homeless population total has remained constant within the midst of such a drastic economic boom can be seen within the data taken during the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Point-in-Time (PIT) Count. According to HUD's PIT Count (2018)HUD 2018 Continuum of Care Homeless Assistance Programs Homeless Populations and Subpopulations. (2018). Retrieved from https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/reportmanagement/published/CoC_PopSub_State_CO_2018.pdf. there are 10,857 people who are currently homeless within the state of Colorado. This report also breaks down several aspects of the homeless population to include the biggest demographics that are currently homeless. The biggest portion of homeless people can be categorized as those with mental illnesses. These 2,171 people make up roughly 20 percent of the total population. According to Bharadwaj, Pai, and Suziedelyte (2017)Bharadwaj, P., Pai, M., & Suziedelyte, A. (2017). Mental Health Stigma. Economics Letters, 159, 57-60. doi: 10.1016/j.econlet.2017.06.028. people are less likely to report that they have a mental health issue when compared to other medical conditions that may be ailing them. This stigma and fear of reporting is leading to many people deciding not to try and fight there disease on their own rather than seeking help. Florida Because of its warm weather, Florida is a favorable destination for the homeless. In 2013, a Central Florida Commission on Homelessness study indicated that the region spends $31,000 a year per homeless person to cover \\"salaries of law-enforcement officers to arrest and transport homeless individuals ‚Äî largely for nonviolent offenses such as trespassing, public intoxication or sleeping in parks ‚Äî as well as the cost of jail stays, emergency-room visits and hospitalization for medical and psychiatric issues.\\" This did not include \\"money spent by nonprofit agencies to feed, clothe and sometimes shelter these individuals\\". In contrast, the report estimated the cost of permanent supportive housing at \\"$10,051 per person per year\\" and concluded that \\"[h]ousing even half of the region's chronically homeless population would save taxpayers $149 million during the next decade ‚Äî even allowing for 10 percent to end up back on the streets again.\\" This particular study followed 107 long-term-homeless residents living in Orange, Osceola, and Seminole Counties. There are similar studies showing large financial savings in Charlotte and Southeastern Colorado from focusing on simply housing the homeless. As of January 2017, there are an estimated 32,190 homeless individuals in Florida. Of this high number, 2,846 are family households, 2,019 are unaccompanied young adults (aged 18‚Äì24), 2,817 are veterans, and an estimated 5,615 are individuals experiencing chronic homelessness. Panhandling and Begging For 2016, the US Census Bureau reported that there were 3,116,886 people in poverty in Florida, or 15.7% of the state's population. 22.8% of them are children. Begging and panhandling are often a consequence of pervasive poverty due to the need to source money. When focusing on the laws against begging and panhandling it is important to begin with the fact that people become beggars and panhandlers for various reasons. They could be in that situation because of socio-economic issues, disability, loss of income due to natural disasters, discrimination due to being a minority group, lack of education, health issues and many more. Consequently, the approach to these social issues must be responsive to people's needs to help them escape poverty and the need to beg. The state of Florida deals with panhandling and begging in a variety of ways, like the rest of the United States. There are overlapping laws from the state, counties, and municipalities. State laws in Florida, according to Legal Beagle, relate primarily to the ban on impeding traffic and roads whereas city ordinances increasingly focus on banning specific areas of the city and certain behaviours. The National Veterans Homeless Support Initiative succinctly phrased current approaches to dealing with panhandling as \\"kick[ing] the can down the road\\", referring to the city of Melbourne in Florida's new punitive sweeping ban on panhandling, adding locations such as ATMs and bus stops to its list of locations individuals can be incriminated for. In 2016 the City of Sarasota's panhandling laws were broadened to be stricter and include all forms of solicitation. The local police department also updated its approach to be more punitive by requiring police to remove unattended items in the streets such as personal items. Those who do not have a home in many Florida cities are facing the dilemma of being outlawed for begging to make money and then criminalized again for being homeless and having nowhere to place their belongings, compounding systemic social issues within the communities.Cruel, Inhuman, and Degrading: Homelessness in the United States under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Submitted to the U.N. Human Rights Committee August 23, 2013. National Law Centre on Homelessness and Poverty. Published: Yale Law School In Lake Worth, Florida, ordinance No. 2014-3 effectively bans panhandling across the entire city. It allows authorities to penalize individuals with a 60-day period in jail or $500 fine which they are unlikely to be able to afford. This has broader systemic issues on the mass incarceration dilemma within the American prison industrial complex because this results increased numbers of those involved in these activities being arrested and ending up within the prison system. Indeed, an issue with begging and panhandling laws across Florida and more broadly is the \\"selective enforcement of public spaces\\" and this is becoming more prevalent with tougher rules across cities in Florida which give police new powers. In 2007, St. Petersburg, Florida passed half a dozen new ordinances aimed at homelessness and begging, including banning storage of belongings in public spaces and making it illegal to sleep in many public areas. Moreover, in 2006, Orlando, Florida passed ordinances that banned groups from feeding more than 25 people in public parks. In 2011, Huffington Post reported how the activist group Food Not Bombs had twelve members arrested for feeding panhandlers and beggars in Orlando, illustrating a new shift in ordinance punitive-ness aiming at not just those begging or panhandling but those willing to give. In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, it is forbidden to give food to homeless in parks also, illustrating the extent of anti-panhandling laws and their expansion in society. A report called 'Criminalising Crises', published by The National Law Centre on Homelessness and Poverty (NLCHP) highlights how the legal system criminalizes homelessness and does nothing to solve social problems. For example, in Alachua County, Florida, police can issue 'Notice to Appear' options for many offences, including panhandling, but this requires a permanent address. Many panhandlers do not have an address, and consequently the police must arrest the individual, placing them in jails instead of dealing with their homelessness. The NLCHP also published a report, \\"No Safe Place,\\" which highlights one of Florida's cities with the strongest criminalization policies: Clearwater, Florida. Clearwater has nearly half of its homeless population (42%) without access to emergency housing or affordable housing and, like other cities such as Orlando, heavily punishes sleeping or sitting in public and panhandling or begging.No Safe Place. The Criminalisation of Homelessness in U.S. Cities. A Report by the National Law Centre on Homelessness and Poverty. 2014 Creative Housing Solutions in Florida found that to reduce the cycle of homeless and beggars going through criminal justice system and health care system, it would be more sustainable if permanent housing was given to chronically homeless, saving Central Florida $21,000 per person in law enforcement costs.Gregory A Shinn, The cost of long term homelessness in central florida: The Current Crises and the economic Impact of providing sustainable housing solutions. 13 (2014) www.impacthomelessness.org Some anti-panhandling laws have been found to be unconstitutional. Tampa's 2013 ordinance, which completely banned panhandling in the downtown area, was ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge in 2016. The city of Sarasota also revised its panhandling and solicitation laws in response to this decision. Miami-Dade County Sex Offender Homelessness A special problem exists in Miami-Dade County, in which restrictive local legislation makes it almost impossible for sex offenders to find legal housing. About 300 are homeless as of 2018 (see Julia Tuttle Causeway sex offender colony). West Palm Beach \\"Baby Shark\\" controversy In July 2019, officials in West Palm Beach, Florida, were criticised for playing a continuous loop of the children's songs Baby Shark and Raining Tacos throughout the night outside city-owned Waterfront Lake Pavilion rental banquet facility as a way of deterring rough sleepers.  Georgia  The rise of neoliberal governance has dramatically changed the way that people who are homeless in heavily populated cities are dealt with and treated around the United States. Neoliberal governance is the promotion of human advancement through economic growth. The most accepted idea of achieving this is by pushing towards a free market economy which thrives off of not having much government or state participation. In the 1970s and 1980s, Atlanta, Georgia was one of these cities where businesses were very active in their efforts to decrease homelessness in the spirit of this idea. The Central Atlanta Progress (CAP) was one of the most notable voices in Atlanta promoting these sort of initiatives. For example, their first major initiative was to criminalize homelessness. They saw the homeless population as a threat to public safety. However, their efforts were met with conflicted responses from police and Georgian citizens due to the large size and demographic makeup of the homeless population in Atlanta. Majority of this group's makeup were black males. On top of that, Atlanta's first black mayor, Maynard Jackson, had been recently elected into office. Having successfully elected a black male into office, the topic of race and politics was prominent in the minds of many Georgian citizens. The idea to criminalize homelessness looked bad in the eyes of these citizens and created a lot of skepticism about the CAP's true purpose. Participation was not met in the way the CAP had hoped for. Since the 1970s and 1980s attempts to combat homelessness have continued not just from businesses but from the government level as well. In 1996 to prepare for hosting the Olympic games, Fulton County provided the homeless people in the area with the opportunity to leave the town as long as they could provide proof of either a family or a job waiting for them at their choice of destination. Fulton County would then give them a one way bus ticket provided that the recipient signed a document agreeing not to return to Atlanta. While it is unclear how many people took this offer to leave the city for free, it is estimated that thousands of the homeless population in Atlanta did take this one-way ticket. For the ones that did not leave, around 9,000 homeless persons were arrested for activities such as trespassing, disorderly conduct, panhandling, and urban camping. Urban camping is the use of public or city owned space to sleep or to protect one's personal belongings. For example, the use of a tent underneath a bridge in order to serve as a living space is prohibited. Action towards panhandling has also been seen from the government. Many downtown cities around the United States have tried to combat panhandlers by prohibiting panhandling at certain locations as well as restricting the time periods that it is allowed. In Georgia, Atlanta was proactive with this idea by banning panhandling in what is known as the \\"tourist triangle\\" in August 2005. Another ban prohibited panhandling within 15 feet of common public places such as ATM's and train stations. Violations are punished with either a fine or imprisonment. In 2012 the city of Atlanta created an anti- panhandling law which criminalizes aggressive panhandling. Aggressive panhandling is defined as any form of gestures or intense intervention for the sake of retrieving monetary substance. This includes blocking the path of a bystander, following a bystander, using harsh language directed at a bystander, or any other indications that could be perceived as a threat by the person it is directed at. Violations are punished based on the number of offenses with the third offense being the highest. The third offense and all future offenses beyond that will result in a minimum of 90 days in jail. A second offense will result in 30 days of jail time while the first offense results in up to 30 days of community service. The policies that Atlanta has put in place were very similar to the ones that Athens, Georgia currently has. Failing to adhere to the law could result in jail time or community service. Athens-Clarke County also added the possibility for a fine to be paid instead of serving prison time or participating in community service. Hawaii In Honolulu, where the homeless interfere with the tourist trade, aggressive measures have been taken to remove the homeless from popular tourist spots such as Waikiki and Chinatown. Measures include criminalizing sitting or lying on sidewalks and transportation of homeless to the mainland. Section 14-75 of the Hawaii County Code gives that soliciting for money in an aggressive manner is illegal. Section 14-74 defines 'aggressive' as to include causing fear, following, touching, blocking or using threatening gestures in the process of panhandling. This carries a $25 fine and may include a term of imprisonment. While many laws targeting homeless populations are not new, there has been a shift in their focus. Prohibitions, including loitering and sleeping outdoors, have expanded to include strict panhandling restraints. These do not necessarily include complete bans, but can cover when, where and how panhandling can be legally conducted. Maria Foscarinis, executive director of the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty, gives that this is a result of gentrification coupled with Hawaii's dependence on tourism. In 2013 alone, tourism in Hawaii generated $14.5 billion, which averaged $39 million per day. This major sector is therefore a vital consideration in panhandling legislation. Hawaiian locals and business operators such as Dave Moskowitz agree with these restraints, arguing that panhandling is bad for tourism. Police, on the other hand, give that panhandling is not a prominent issue, nor is it prioritized. Legally, ethically and practically, it is difficult for police to enforce strict panhandling laws at all times, thus police discretion plays a vital role in determining who is cited and how many citations are given. For the panhandling population who are cited, there is a general feeling of indifference, perhaps even disregard. Ralph McCarroll, for example, says that he has 30 citations and that law enforcement knows that he is never going to pay them. A number of studies indicate that the average panhandler is an unmarried, unemployed male in his 30s to 40s, often with drug/alcohol problems, a lack of social support and laborer's skills. These factors are likely to affect the poor perception of these laws in the panhandling population. Social justice advocates and non-governmental organizations will argue that this approach is therefore counter-intuitive. They argue that panhandling laws violate free speech, criminalize homelessness and remove an essential part of destitute people's lives. Doran Porter, executive director of the Affordable Housing and Homeless Alliance, argues that these laws merely deal with the symptoms of homelessness rather than fixing the problem. The role of the court is essential in clarifying whether the laws are constitutionally valid. In 2015, the American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii foundation (ACLUH) paired with Davis Levin Livingston Law Firm to represent Justin Guy in suit against the Hawaii County. Guy's lawyers argued that prohibiting their client from holding up a sign that read 'Homeless Please Help' offended his First Amendment right to freedom of speech. Matthew Winter, a lawyer on the case, made reference to political candidates (who are lawfully able to hold signs), to contrast against the inability of the poor to hold up signs asking for help. The court ruled in Guy's favour, which led to an award of $80,000 compensation and repeal of subsections 14‚Äì74, 14‚Äì75, 15‚Äì9, 15‚Äì20, 15‚Äì21, 15-35 and 15-37 of the Hawaii County Code. In a statement, Guy emphasized the need for the State of Hawaii to treat the homeless with the same dignity as the general population. This court ruling is a positive step in that direction. The future of panhandling laws in Hawaii is reliant on legislators and their perception of panhandling's impact on tourism. By utilizing aggressive political language, such as 'the war on homelessness' and 'emergency state,' Hawaiian politics will continue to criminalize the behaviours of destitute populations. On the other hand, with pressure from state/federal departments and non-governmental organizations, restrictions on panhandling laws may be possible. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, for example, has stated that it would not provide homeless assistance funds to states that criminalize homelessness. Given that Hawaii has one of the USA's largest growing homeless populations (between 2007 and 2016, Hawaii saw a 30.5% increase in homelessness), it is in a poor position to reject federal funding and assistance from non-governmental organizations. Due to these factors, recent court disapproval, repeals and police discretion, it is likely that over time strict panhandling laws in Hawaii will lessen in severity. Illinois Over the years, the city of Chicago, Illinois has gained a reputation as the city with the most homeless people, rivaling Los Angeles and New York City, although no statistical data have backed this up. The reputation stems primarily from the subjective number of beggars found on the streets rather than any sort of objective statistical census data. Indeed, from statistical data, Chicago has far less homeless per capita than peers New York, and Los Angeles, or other major cities such as Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Boston, among others, with only 5,922 homeless recorded in a one night count taken in 2007.\\"Homeless in Chicago: 2007 Numbers and Demographics: Point-In-Time Analysis\\", The Chicago Alliance, 2007. A 2019 study by the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless found that among Chicago's homeless population for 2017, 18,000 had college degrees and 13,000 were employed. Indiana In Indianapolis, Indiana, as many as 2,200 people are homeless on any given night, and as many as 15,000 individuals over the course of a year. Indianapolis is notable among cities of similar size for having only faith-based shelters, such as the century-old Wheeler Mission. In 2001, Mayor Bart Peterson endorsed a 10-year plan, called the Blueprint to End Homelessness, and made it one of his administration's top priorities. The plan's main goals are for more affordable housing units, employment opportunities, and support services. The Blueprint notwithstanding, Indianapolis has criminalized aspects of homelessness, such as making panhandling a misdemeanor; and the City-County Council has twice (in April 2002, and August 2005) denied the zoning necessary to open a new shelter for homeless women. Iowa Homelessness in Iowa is a significant issue. In 2015, 12,918 Iowans were homeless and 'served by emergency shelters, transitional housing, rapid rehousing or street outreach projects'. Another 8,174 Iowans were at risk of being homeless and lived in supportive housing or were involved in street outreach projects. The actual number of homeless Iowans is likely to be substantially greater, as these figures only account for those who sought help. Homelessness is particularly problematic in Iowa City, as there is only one shelter in the city to cater for its large homeless population. Further, those who have been abusing substances are prohibited from using this shelter, thus excluding a large proportion of homeless people. Panhandling has become an increasingly significant problem in Iowa. There is much controversy surrounding how best to deal with this widespread issue. Debate has focused on the best way to balance compassion, free speech and public safety. Iowan cities have struggled with finding the balance between avoiding criminalising poverty, while at the same time not encouraging begging, particularly that which is aggressive. There has also been widespread concern about the legitimacy of panhandlers and the significant amount of money that some are making. Cedar Rapids panhandler, Dawn, admitted that she has come across many illegitimate panhandlers. These include people who already have access to housing and financial assistance, and even some who pretend to be disabled or to be a veteran. A famous incident in Muscatine, Iowa, photos of which went viral, provides a prime example of the tensions that exist around the legitimacy of panhandlers. In December 2015, two young boys were panhandling, holding signs which read 'broke and hungry please'. Pothoff, who worked nearby, offered the boys a job. The boys stated that they were 'not from around here', smirked and walked away. Pothoff then decided to join the boys on the side of the road, holding up his own sign, which read 'Offered these guys a job, they said no, don't give them money'. Following the Supreme Court case, United States v Kokinda, 497 U.S. 720, 725 (1990), the right to beg for money is protected speech under the First Amendment. Therefore, panhandling cannot be entirely prohibited. However, as per Ward v Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989), US cities may enact 'reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions' which are narrowly drafted to 'serve a significant governmental interest' and also allow for this speech to occur in an alternative setting. This has led to a trend amongst many Iowan cities of enacting ordinances which control and restrict panhandling. In Bettendorf, aggressive panhandling, panhandling on a travelled portion of a roadway and soliciting on a bus, bus stop, within 15 feet of an automated teller machine or on Interstate 74 exit ramps between certain hours of the day are all prohibited. Additionally, a panhandling licence is required and this can be revoked for 6 months if any of these regulations are breached, in addition to a fine or incarceration. Bettendorf grants panhandling licences for free, however licences must be renewed every 6 months and candidates must undergo a police check. Similarly, in Davenport, aggressive panhandling, soliciting within 20 feet of an automated teller machine or bank entrance, or on a roadway or median of a roadway are prohibited. Police Chief Paul Sirorski admitted that the ordinance can be difficult to enforce and that the number of complaints concerning panhandlers in Davenport is increasing. In light of community concerns, Davenport is set to review the ordinance. Iowa City has similar ordinances and has also installed special purple parking meters which are used to fund homeless organizations. The aim is to encourage people to give money to homeless programs through parking fees, rather than directly to beggars. However, some argue that it is better to donate money to panhandlers than to organizations as you can be sure that the money is going directly to the person without any loss through administrative costs. As Cedar Rapids currently has no ordinance controlling panhandling, there has been an increase in the number of panhandlers. Cedar Rapids has also seen an increase in the number of complaints concerning panhandlers. This has led to consideration of the introduction of an ordinance that would prohibit panhandling in certain areas. The ordinance also includes plans for police to be able to give resource cards to panhandlers. These cards provide a list of resources which provide housing, food and financial assistance. Councils claim that these ordinances are necessary to ensure public safety and prevent traffic accidents. Other rationales behind these laws include 'to improve the image of the city to tourists, businesses and other potential investors' and to reflect the growing \\"compassion fatigue\\" of the city's middle and upper class after increasingly being exposed to widespread homelessness. However, Saelinger (2006) argues that these laws '\\"criminalize\\" the very condition of being homeless'. Saelinger (2006) also claims that through the implementation of these laws, governments have focused on making homelessness invisible, rather than working to eradicate it. The aesthetics of cities has also influenced the enactment of these ordinances, with businesses complaining that panhandlers bother their customers and make them feel uncomfortable, in addition to ruining the image of the city. Kansas In comparison with the US, Kansas continued to have an increasing level of homelessness until 2015. Between 2007 and 2015, homelessness across the US fell by 13 percent, while in Kansas it rose by more than 23 percent. Single individuals predominantly fell victim to homelessness rather than families, generating this increase in homelessness. This is in discord with Sedgwick County's reputation as one of the most successful counties in the US for providing shelter to homeless family members and individuals. Chronic homelessness was seen to be more prevalent and increasing as was the proportion of veterans subjected to sleeping on the streets. However, Kansas currently holds approximately 0.5% of the total homelessness in the US, listing itself in the bottom third of all of the US states. =Begging and associated crimes= There is much concern within Kansas regarding the legitimacy of begging and panhandling. For example, within Wichita alone, there are many reports of persons posing as homeless to make a quick income and fuel their addiction habits such as alcohol, drugs, and sex. This has been seen to increase recently with the development of boutiques and shops that are drawing growing numbers of customers and tourists to the area. Residents have further complained that many whom are homeless are frequently choosing to bypass available services in order to maintain their lifestyle. This increase in 'untruthful' begging has resulted in further chronic homelessness, as those who are most genuinely in need are being sidelined by 'quick-fix intruders'. The consequences of begging and panhandling across Kansas is not uniform, it differs from county to county, with some counties choosing to acknowledge it as a crime and others rejecting its presence. Under Kansas' Wyandotte County code of ordinances, panhandling is deemed an unlawful act when it occurs in an aggressive manner. The consequences of panhandling present as an unclassified misdemeanour, which under Wyandotte County law signifies that unless the penalty is otherwise stated, it will receive the same penalty as a Class C misdemeanour i.e., punishable by up to one month in jail and a fine of up to $500. This is less severe in comparison to Wichita County whereby the act of begging is deemed as a crime of loitering and is penalized with a fine of up to $1,000, one year imprisonment, or both. Counties such as Topeka County and Sedgwick however differ, with Sedgwick County making no mention of such acts constituting crimes within its ordinance, Topeka follows suit. Such a scenario in Topeka occurred due to a 9‚Äì0 vote to defer action of panhandling, where a penalty of 179 days in jail and/or a fine up to $499 might have been applied if caught violating this ordinance. This ordinance was only suspended indefinitely, however if it is reviewed and passed, it may result in the banning of solicitation on private property unless prior permission has been granted from the property owner (begging would not be affected and would remain legal). Topeka currently does hold laws against soliciting on public property, which have not been found to target the homeless, rather targeting many backpackers instead. According to Topeka law, it is illegal to solicit funds, rides, or contributions along roadways, meaning that persons whom present cardboard signs asking for lifts throughout the city can be liable to penalties. Such a law has stemmed from the high prevalence of scams in the area (men saying they have mechanical issues with their cars and women citing domestic abuse and the need for funds to stay at a hotel) which has forced a public awareness and therefore campaigns in the area. Kansas has a variety of services available to those who encounter panhandlers with organizations such as Downtown Wichita in association with the Wichita police, creating information on methods to stop panhandling. This has been developed in the mode of a myriad of pamphlets regarding available services for the homeless which can be printed off and distributed by businesses when they encounter persons panhandling or begging. Such services often report back to the Homeless Outreach Team in an attempt to reduce the prevalence of homelessness in the long-term. Persons encountering panhandlers and beggars in Kansas, if unable to politely refuse, are encouraged to contact 911. Kentucky Many city and counties within the United States have enacted ordinances to limit or ban panhandling. However, the legality of such laws has recently come under scrutiny, being challenged as a violation of individuals first amendment rights. The first amendment states that \\"Congress shall make no law ... prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech.\\" It is therefore argued that stopping someone from asking for help from their fellow citizens is impeding on their right to free speech. Panhandling laws differ throughout the state of Kentucky. In the city of Louisville, for example, it is an offence to panhandle in certain locations including: within 20 meters of a bus stop or ATM, in a crosswalk/ street, or anywhere that may be impeding others. The ordinance places a strong emphasis on aggressive panhandling which had become a prominent issue within Louisville. These municipal laws are one of the many that have recently come under scrutiny, being challenged as unconstitutional under first amendment rights. In October 2016, a judge of the Jefferson Court District ruled against the laws, deeming them to be unconstitutional. This decision is currently being reviewed by the Kentucky Supreme Court. In contrast, the city of Ashland, Kentucky has not come under scrutiny as their ordinance is less comprehensive and therefore less likely to impede individuals rights. However, recently the ordinance was amended to further crack down on the act of panhandling, adding an amendment to stop panhandlers from walking out into traffic, in an attempt to keep both beggars and the public safe. Panhandling laws are often controversial as they are generally welcomed by the public, who can feel harassed. However, it is also argued that they are disadvantaging the homeless and those in need. As an attorney of the UCLA states, panhandling laws are \\"misdirected\\" and their purpose is to try and hide the problem of homelessness. There are 4,538 reported homeless in the state of Kentucky (0.10% of the population), which is consistent with rates of homelessness in many of Kentucky's neighbouring states including Tennessee and Ohio. This number of homeless in Kentucky has declined since 2014. The Kentucky Interagency Council on Homelessness is working towards an end to homelessness, their mission; to end homelessness across the state of Kentucky, with clear outlined goals and strategies on how this is going to be achieved. One of their main goals is to assist local municipalities to end homelessness within the state. The director for Homeless Prevention and Intervention in Kentucky, Charlie Lanter, says that in regards to panhandling, \\"if they're successful, then they have no incentive to go to a shelter or to go somewhere for food, or whatever their particular needs are ...\\" which limits the organizations ability to assist the individual off the streets. In particular, the city of Owensber has had support from its homeless shelters in protecting panhandler's rights on the streets, for example, Harry Pedigo, the director of St. Benedicts Homeless Shelter in Kentucky wants local panhandlers to know that the homeless organizations are there to help and not judge their situation. Louisiana Begging, panhandling and homelessness have been prevalent issues for the state of Louisiana for some time, and correlate closely with its poverty rates. Particularly since the disastrous Hurricane Katrina, which hit many Southern American states in 2005, poverty has maintained at a high level The hurricane led to 1577 deaths in Louisiana alone, with $13 billion invested in flood insurance aid Hurricane Katrina did not just have devastating physical and environmental impacts on Louisiana, but also socio- economical ones. Much of Louisiana, and New Orleans in particular, is made up of African-African, elderly and veteran populations, many of whom were plunged into further poverty once their houses were damaged by floods As a result, begging and panhandling in Louisiana is not just a matter of economics, but also of gender, race and age. Louisiana remains the third most impoverished state in the United States, with nearly 1 in 5 people living in poverty. Begging and panhandling is now illegal in the state of Louisiana. Bill HB115 was passed first through the Louisiana Legislative House in 2014, and then approved by the Senate later in 2015. Through the criminalization of begging, offenders can now be given fines of approximately $200, or alternatively sentenced to up to 6 months in jail. Although the bill specifically targets homeless populations in Louisiana, it also applies to prostitution, hitchhikers and the general solicitation of money. Supporters of the Bill hope that the criminalization of begging will lead to fewer homeless and poor people on the streets Louisiana State Representative Austin Badone, the creator of the begging and panhandling bill, suggests that many of these people are not actually in need, and described the process of begging as a \\"racket.\\" Those opposed to the criminalization of begging and panhandling maintain that the law is unconstitutional, as they view begging under the category of Freedom of Speech. As a result, HB 115 has sparked social and political debate since its administration, as many argue that begging is protected under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. Initially, this was said to only apply to non-aggressive forms of panhandling or begging, which do not include any use of force or threats. However, the criminalization of all begging in Louisiana has called into question whether or not the bill breaches the First Amendment right. Because of these claims, Louisiana has taken steps to showcase that the First Amendment is being protected. The city of Slidell, Louisiana voted in July 2016 to implement permits for beggars and homeless people. This would legally allow begging and panhandling in certain outlined areas. If their application is approved, this permit would be valid for one year, and would be required to be displayed during panhandling and begging The permit can also be denied if the applicant has previously been charged with misdemeanours such as harassment or other begging-related offences. Enforcement is set to begin by local Slidell authorities in November 2016. Maryland It is estimated that each year over 50,000 people experience homelessness in Maryland. Although Maryland is one of the nation's wealthiest states, over 50% of impoverished Marylanders live in \\"deep poverty\\", meaning that their annual income is less than half of the federally defined poverty level. Homelessness in Maryland increased by 7 percent between 2014 and 2015 according to statistics released by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. =Begging and associated crimes in Maryland= Panhandling in Maryland is widely protected under the First Amendment, provided that the act does not include conduct which 'harasses, menaces, intimidates, impedes traffic or otherwise causes harm'. The president of the nonpartisan First Amendment Center has stated that any legislation prohibiting the act of begging violates the constitution by \\"limiting a citizen's right to ask for help\\". In 1994, Baltimore City enacted a zero-tolerance arrest policy to counter rising violent crime rates, prompting a push to reclaim public spaces by targeting beggars and homeless persons. This resulted in the case of Patton v. Baltimore City (1994), where zero-tolerance arrest policies to reclaim public spaces were ruled to be unconstitutional, due to violation of the homeless' First Amendment right to freedom of association. Traffic hazards due to roadside solicitation have been identified as a cause of concern throughout Maryland, generating various attempts by legal officials to regulate panhandling in high traffic areas. As a result, solicitation or panhandling is banned on or beside state roads under state law. A statewide ban on panhandling and vending at all highway intersections was proposed in 2001, but was later revised to apply only to Charles County. In 2006, the Anne Arundel County Council enacted a ban on panhandling by children under 18 years old. In April 2007, the Maryland General Assembly passed a bill banning panhandling beside and on Anne Arundel County roadways, as well as prohibiting the display of political signs or advertising messages on any public roadways. The American Civil Liberties Union have consistently opposed solicitation bans, due to concerns that legislation may hinder the fundraising efforts of legitimate organizations. A bill has since passed the House of Delegates in 2016, allowing the act of panhandling by firefighters and non-profit groups, pending their successful completion of traffic safety courses. In late 2011, legislation was proposed in Montgomery County which would require panhandlers to seek permits in order to engage in roadside solicitation, but this proposition was heavily scrutinized due to concerns that panhandling permits could constitute a breach of the First Amendment. In September 2013, Montgomery County leaders announced a plan to instead purge panhandling from busy streets by encouraging citizens to donate money to not-for-profit shelters and food banks, rather than directly donating to panhandling persons. In 2012, Allegany County imposed narrow restrictions on panhandling, allowing only one day permit per person per year for roadside solicitations. Other areas of Maryland with similar permit provisions include Cecil, Frederick and Baltimore counties. In 2012, certain panhandling ordinances within Frederick County revived First Amendment debates after undercover police officers donated money to begging persons and subsequently arrested them on panhandling charges. Frederick County police allegedly responded by indicating that their initiative in panhandling arrests was in response to reported 'quality of life' issues. In early 2013, legislation to ban the act of panhandling in commercial districts within Baltimore was put forward, but was met with backlash by a mass of protesters chanting \\"homes not handcuffs\\". A revised bill was proposed in November, stipulating that panhandling would be prohibited only within 10 feet of outdoor dining areas. In response, the president of Health Care for the Homeless in Baltimore County stated that the city already had stringent anti- begging laws and that the proposed legislation would merely make it easier to arrest impoverished citizens, which would in turn create further obstacles to their future self-sufficiency. In addition to aggressive panhandling, Takoma Park Municipal Code within Montgomery County currently prohibits panhandling in \\"darkness\\" (defined as the hours between sunset and sunrise) as well as the solicitation of persons in motor vehicles and in specific locations including bus stops, outdoor cafes and taxi stands. Massachusetts In 1969, the Pine Street Inn was founded by Paul Sullivan on Pine Street in Boston's Chinatown district and began caring for homeless destitute alcoholics.\\"Pine Street Inn History\\", Pine Street Inn website In 1974, Kip Tiernan founded Rosie's Place in Boston, the first drop-in and emergency shelter for women in the United States, in response to the increasing numbers of needy women throughout the country. In 1980, the Pine Street Inn had to move to larger facilities on Harrison Avenue in Boston and in 1984, Saint Francis House had to move its operation from the St. Anthony Shrine on Arch Street to an entire ten-floor building on Boylston Street.Saint Francis House: History ‚Äì website In 1985, the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program was founded to assist the growing numbers of homeless living on the streets and in shelters in Boston and who were suffering from lack of effective medical services.\\"History: Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program\\" , bhchp.orgO'Connell, James, M.D., Stories from the Shadows, August 2015, In August 2007, in Boston, Massachusetts, the city took action to keep loiterers, including the homeless, off the Boston Common overnight, after a series of violent crimes and drug arrests.St. Martin, Greg, \\"Night watch: Police removing overnight loiterers on Common\\", Boston Metro newspaper, Wednesday, August 29, 2007. In December 2007, Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston, announced that the one night homeless count had revealed that the actual number of homeless living in the streets was down.Loh, Christopher, \\"City experts predict drop in homeless numbers\\", Boston Now newspaper, December 20, 2007. In October 2008, Connie Paige of The Boston Globe reported that the number of homeless in Massachusetts had reached an all-time high, mostly due to mortgage foreclosures and the national economic crisis.Paige, Connie, Homelessness hits record high: Advocates expect numbers to grow amid economic downturn and ask for state aid, The Boston Globe, October 6, 2008 In October 2009, as part of the city's Leading the Way initiative, Mayor Thomas Menino of Boston dedicated and opened the Weintraub Day Center which is the first city-operated day center for chronically homeless persons. It is a multi-service center, providing shelter, counseling, health care, housing assistance, and other support services. It is a facility located in the Woods Mullen Shelter. It is also meant to reduce the strain on the city's hospital emergency rooms by providing services and identifying health problems before they escalate into emergencies. It was funded by $3 million in grants from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), the Massachusetts Medical Society and Alliance Charitable Foundation, and the United States Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).Mayor's Office, City of Boston, \\"Mayor Menino Dedicates New Day Center for the Homeless\\", Press Release, October 14, 2009. In 2010, there was a continued crackdown on panhandling, especially the aggressive type, in downtown Boston. Summonses were being handed out, with scheduled court appearances. The results were mixed and in one upscale neighborhood, Beacon Hill, the resolve of the Beacon Hill Civic Association, which has received only one complaint about panhandlers, was to try to solve the bigger problem not by criminal actions.Sennott, Adam, \\"Panhandling on Beacon Hill: The Lowdown on a Reported Crackdown\\" , Spare Change News, Boston, June 4, 2010 Due to economic constraints in 2010, Governor Deval Patrick had to cut the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 2011 budget so dental care for the majority of adults, including most homeless people, covered by MassHealth (Medicaid) would no longer be provided except for cleaning and extractions, with no fillings, dentures, or restorative care.Cunningham, Liam, \\"Cuts Extract Mass Health Dental Benefits From Budget\\" , Spare Change News, July 16, 2010 issue.Commonwealth of Massachusetts, \\"Healthcare: Governor's FY2011 Budget\\". \\"The MassHealth adult dental benefit is restructured to cover preventative and emergency services only, excluding restorative dental services.\\" This does not affect dental care for children.

In September 2010, it was reported that the Housing First Initiative had significantly reduced the chronic homeless single person population in Boston, Massachusetts, although homeless families were still increasing in number. Some shelters were reducing the number of beds due to lowered numbers of homeless, and some emergency shelter facilities were closing, especially the emergency Boston Night Center.Brady-Myerov, Monica, \\"Homelessness On The Decline In Boston\\", WBUR Radio, Boston, September 29, 2010 There is sometimes corruption and theft by the employees of a shelter as evidenced by a 2011 investigative report by FOX 25 TV in Boston wherein a number of Boston public shelter employees were found stealing large amounts of food over a period of time from the shelter's kitchen for their private use and catering.Beaudet, Mike, \\"FOX Undercover: Employees implicated in thefts from local homeless\\" , FOX 25 TV, Boston, Tuesday, February 22, 2011Smith, Stephen, \\"Shelter kitchen theft prevalent, report says\\", The Boston Globe, February 23, 2011 In October 2017, Boston Mayor Martin J.

Michigan Michigan has a high number of homeless individuals on its streets, reaching 97,642 in 2014. In the VI-SPADT (Vulnerability Index and Service Prioritization Decision Assistance tool) initiated by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) alongside the Michigan State Housing Development Authority (MSHDA) it was found that 2,462 individuals had 4,564 interactions with the police between June 2014 and April 2015. The VI-SPADT also found that minority populations are overrepresented with 52% of the homeless population being a part of a minority group as well as people with disabilities of long duration such as chronic health conditions, mental health/cognitive conditions and substance abuse (65%). The criminalization of panhandling in Michigan has been the subject to much debate in public opinion and in the courts: In 2011 and 2013, Grand Rapids was the centre for this debate. In 2011, the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan (ACLU) filed a federal lawsuit challenging a law that makes begging a crime as a violation of free speech. Prior to this, the ACLU discovered that police officers had been arresting, prosecuting and jailing individual people for requesting financial assistance on the streets. Between 2008 and 2011, there were approximately 400 arrests made by Grand Rapids under an old law that criminalizes the act of begging - 211 of these cases resulted in jail time. The ACLU focused on the cases of two men. James Speet was arrested for holding a sign reading \\"Need a Job. God Bless\\" and Ernest Sims, a veteran, was arrested for asking for spare change for a bus fare. The debate was seated in the fact that other individuals and organizations were allowed to raise funds on the streets without being charged for a crime, yet these man were jailed for the same principle. The results of these cases were positive for the ACLU side - Judge Robert Jonker ruled in 2012 that the law is unconstitutional and in 2013 the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that begging is protected speech under the First Amendment. On the opposition side of this case and wider debate was the State Attorney General Bill Schuette who appealed the ruling that the state law violated the First Amendment. Schuette contended that the city and the state safety is at risk and there were concerns around pedestrian and vehicle traffic, protection of businesses and tourism, as well as fraud. The state and argued that it had an interest in preventing Fraud - Schuette contended that not all who beg are legitimately homeless or use the funds they raise to meet basic needs, the money goes to alcohol and other substances. The court agreed with Schuette that preventing fraud and duress are in the interest of the state, but directly prohibiting begging does not align with the prevention of fraud as they are not necessarily intertwined. This debate resurfaced again in 2016 with the two sides again being prevention of unwanted behaviours and preservation of constitutional rights. In Battle Creek, officials passed a pair of proposals that are aimed at limiting panhandling and loitering throughout the city. City commissioners were split in the vote along with the general public. Under the new ordinances the following situations could lead to legal apprehension by the police - remaining idly within 25 feet of an intersection without a license; soliciting money from anyone near building entrances, restrooms, ATMS or in line; panhandling between sunset and sunrise on public property without an official license or permit; approaching another person in a way that would cause a reasonable person to feel terrorized, intimidated or harassed; forcing oneself upon another i.e. continuing to ask for money after being turned down. Any violations can be considered civil infractions and can result in fines. The bill, aimed at targeting 'aggressive' panhandling was passed in September 2016. There are a range of implications that come along with the criminalization of begging behaviours. Jessica Vail is the program manager of the Grand Rapids Area Collation to End Homelessness and contends that it is more cost efficient for people to not be homeless and it also keeps our criminal justice system from getting overloaded. Don Mitchell conducted research in 1998 on the criminalization of behaviours associated with homelessness and begging and highlighted the negative effect this has on the cycle of homelessness and crime. Criminalizing behaviours that are necessary for the survival of homeless people such as begging, sleeping and sitting in public, loitering in parks and on streets and urinating and defecating in public leads them to be subjects of the criminal justice system. ACLU legislative liaison Shelli Weisberg consolidates this notion of a cyclical disadvantage in 2016 - fining people who cannot afford to pay a fine for something they cannot avoid doing and then putting them in a system where they cannot afford to defend themselves or challenge these offences questions how just the criminalization of such acts is. Minnesota In Minnesota, the prevalence of panhandling, solicitation and begging in relation to homelessness have been deemed to be distinctive to each city. For example, in Stevens County, administrators of social service programs unanimously agreed that rural poverty is distinguishable by location and panhandlers have a low presence in Stevens County, while a high frequency in the city of Minneapolis situated in Hennepin County. In 2013, a statewide study conducted by the Wilder Foundation on Homelessness indicated the presence of 10,214 homeless in Minnesota. The one-day count was conducted by 1,200 volunteers around 400 locations known to attract homeless such as transitional housing, shelters, drop in sites, hot meal programs and church basements. An increase of six percent in homeless were observed since the last study in 2009, while 55% of the homeless population were females and over 46% were under the age of 21. In a study conducted by St Stephen's Street Outreach staff, 55 panhandlers were surveyed in downtown Minneapolis to determine why people beg and how local police treat panhandlers. Individual responses neither collectively favoured negative or positive responses for the interaction between police and panhandlers. Examples of responses include that the police 'give you trouble', tell them to 'get the hell out of here' and 'give you a ticket', while other individuals believed that police were 'usually understanding', 'gentle' and 'very friendly and helpful'. In 2004, Minneapolis' anti-begging law was overturned due to its breach of the First Amendment, the right to free speech. As a result of this response, the city council of Minneapolis collectively agreed to implement a modified version of the anti begging law. Although panhandlers are protected by the First Amendment, those who aggressively solicit and/or in prohibited locations are in the act of violating the Minneapolis City Ordinance 385.60. This regulation is violated when an individual offers a service of low value for a donation or verbally requests for an object or money in locations such as the entry way of a government building, near a parked vehicle, near public transport, in or near a restroom, on a crosswalk, entertainment venues, petrol station, convenience store or near a financial establishment. The individual must also use either physical contact, threaten criminal activity upon property, block entrances, stalk, use abusive language, suggest body mutilation if not given money, beg in groups of more than one person, beg under the influence of drugs or alcohol and solicit in the night hours after sunset and before sunrise in those areas. The purpose of the Minneapolis city ordinance 385.60 is to protect the public for being hounded by panhandlers at certain locations. However, law in the state of Minnesota does not prohibit passive panhandling, such as holding a sign without verbal interaction and focuses on aggressive panhandling as a breach of the law. Other cities in Minnesota such as Rochester, Brooklyn Center and St Paul have similar versions of the ordinance and have all avoided judicial scrutiny on the grounds of protecting individual privacy against assault based behaviour. Efforts by the population of Minnesota to redirect the money given to panhandlers to organizations that aim to end homelessness have been implemented in the city of Minneapolis. An example of this is 'Give Real Change', a campaign that began in 2009 with the aim to end homelessness for 300 to 500 people in areas within Minneapolis by the end of 2025. Billboards implemented by the campaign that display 'Say NO To Panhandling and YES To Giving,' urge community members to stop giving money to beggars and alternatively donate it to an organization that allocates money to shelters to end homelessness. The executive director of St Stephens Human Services, Gail Dorfman is a supporter of the initiative and believes that it can act as a long-term solution for homelessness. Mississippi It is estimated that there are at least 1,738 homeless people in the US state of Mississippi, according to the 2016 Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congress prepared by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. This number is likely to be much greater as this survey only provides a snapshot of homelessness rates at the time of data collection in January 2016. Although homeless people in Mississippi comprise less than 1% of the total US homeless population and there has been a 37% reduction in the number of homeless people in Mississippi from 2010 figures, the state has a comparably high rate of unsheltered homeless people (50%) which is only surpassed by US states such as California, Oregon, Hawaii and Nevada. Moreover, the state also has the second highest rate of unsheltered homeless veterans in the country (60%) and the fourth highest rate of unsheltered homelessness for people with a disability (84%). =Anti-panhandling laws= High rates of homeless people living without suitable accommodation and in public areas creates greater awareness of their presence both by the local community and policing agencies and has resulted in the introduction of laws directed against acts associated with homelessness, otherwise known as vagrancy including begging or panhandling. While in most US states such legislation is primarily enacted and included in city ordinances rather than state law, in Mississippi, the 2015 Mississippi Code provides for a specific definition of vagrancy that allows for \\"able- bodied persons who go begging for a livelihood\\" to be punished as vagrants as they are seen to be committing crimes against public peace and security. In addition, Title 99, Chapter 29 of the Code mandates law enforcement officers to arrest known vagrants with those deemed 'vagrant' subjected to fines for a first offence and up to six months imprisonment and the payment of court costs for subsequent offences. These definitions and penalties for homelessness have remained largely unchanged historically in the state of Mississippi which has tended to define vagrants to include those living in idleness or without employment and having no means of support, prostitutes, gamblers as well as beggars. Those who fall under these population groups continue to be defined as vagrants under the 2015 Mississippi Code. Controversially, such wide and discriminatory definitions have been tied to Mississippi's poor race relations with African Americans with vagrancy legislation in the latter half of the 19th century linked to \\"keeping black people in their rightful place\\" on the slave plantations. As a consequence, Mississippi's 'Black Code' on vagrancy applied in a racially discriminatory manner to African Americans such as ex- slaves and 'idle blacks' as well as white Americans who associated themselves with African Americans. While Mississippi was the first US state to enact such discriminatory and punitive legislation against African Americans, it was certainly not the last, with states including South Carolina, Alabama and Louisiana following Mississippi's lead with similar 'Black Code' legislation in 1865 that targeted homeless ex-slaves. In Jackson, Mississippi's largest city, begging or panhandling is specifically prohibited under the definition of \\"commercial solicitation\\". Begging is banned within 15 feet of public toilets, automatic teller machines (ATMs), parking lots, outdoor eating areas, pay telephones, bus stops, subway stations and entirely within the central business district. In addition, begging is also banned after sunset and before sunrise and it is unlawful to \\"aggressive solicit\\" by blocking the path of another person, following another person, using abusive language or making a statement or gesture that would cause fear by a reasonable person. Penalties for a first offence include a warning, citation or seven days community service, subject to law enforcement and prosecutor discretion. For subsequent offences, penalties may include up to 30 days community service, a $1,000 fine or up to 30 days imprisonment. However, passive solicitation is not unlawful. This means that simply holding a sign asking for money is not illegal and in fact, is protected by the Jackson city ordinance that prohibits panhandling. Similar legislation that prohibits begging is also in place in Mississippi's second largest city, Gulfport. In July 2012, Jackson City Councilman Quentin Whitwell proposed tripling existing fines and implementing longer jail sentences for panhandling in response to heightened community concern about aggressive panhandlers and an escalating panhandling \\"epidemic\\". However, this proposal was later rejected by the Jackson City Council amidst concerns from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Mississippi that prohibiting panhandling under city ordinances may violate First Amendment rights under the US Constitution that protect freedom of speech. On the streets of Jackson, for people experiencing homelessness such as Raymond Quarles, city ordinances such as those originally proposed to prohibit begging increase their susceptibility to counter-productive law enforcement attention and policing activity. For instance, Raymond was arrested at least 10 times in as little as one month in Jackson shortly after experiencing homelessness from the combined effects of relationship breakdown, financial stress and a deterioration in physical health. What Raymond and the ACLU call for are additional support services to assist homeless community members find employment, housing and other support services rather than a \\"revolving door of crime\\" and entry into the criminal justice system that is perpetuated through simplistic bans on panhandling and other associated acts of vagrancy. While the US Supreme Court has not decisively decided on this issue and there is considerable debate as to whether begging constitutes conduct or speech, Fraser (2010) suggests that begging is likely to constitute speech and therefore blanket bans on begging in public areas enacted by local governments as in the case of Mississippi cities such as Jackson and Gulfport are likely to be unconstitutional and in breach of the First Amendment. Nebraska Over 10,000 people are considered to be living without permanent accommodation in Nebraska, with a little over half of those situated in Omaha and a quarter in the state's capitol of Lincoln. According to The University of Nebraska-Lincoln's Centre on Children, Families and Law a little over half of Nebraska's homeless population is situated in Omaha and a quarter in Lincoln with the balance in spread over the rest of the state. Approximately 10 percent of those homeless in Nebraska are considered 'chronically homeless' and have either been homeless for an entire year or homeless four times in a three-year period. Such statistics have prompted the Nebraskan Government to implement a newly revised 10-year plan for dealing with homelessness which a vision of '[supporting] a statewide Continuum of Care that coordinates services provided to all people and that promotes safe, decent, affordable, and appropriate housing resulting in healthy and viable Nebraskan communities'. Charles Coley, executive director of the Metro Area Coalition of Care of the Homeless and member of the Nebraska Commission on Housing and Homelessness said that '[the commission] chose to strategically to align [their] goals with the goals of the federal strategic plan to prevent homelessness'. Coley further stated that the 'four goals are end chronic homelessness, secondarily end veteran homelessness, thirdly end child/family and youth homeless and then finally set a path to reducing overall homelessness'. Of those currently living without permanent accommodation in Nebraska, a portion of those are Veterans and those fleeing domestic violence. The First Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits 'the making of any law respecting an establishment of religion, ensuring that there is no prohibition on the free exercise of religion and abridging the freedom of speech'. In the United States, Panhandling is typically protected by the First Amendment as one has the right to free speech with many states and cities respecting citizen's right to free speech and allowing panhandling. In the Nebraskan city of Omaha, panhandling is currently illegal. Previously, the Omaha Panhandling Ordinance stipulated that 'anyone who wants to solicit money - other than a religious organization or a charity - must obtain written permission from the police chief' with religious organizations and charities protected under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. As of December 2015, Omaha's current panhandling ordinance states that aggressive panhandling, such as approaching someone several times to ask for money or touching them without consent, is punishable by imprisonment or fine. The new Omaha ordinance also outlaws other particular forms of panhandling including asking for money within 15 feet of an ATM or other location where money is dispensed, following someone to ask them for money, panhandling on private property such as going to someone's front door and asking for money, and panhandling in street traffic. The American Civil Liberties Union has raised numerous concerns over Omaha's previous and current panhandling ordinance as it was a violation of the First Amendment and entered negotiations with the City Attorney's Office about their unconstitutional ordinances. The City Council however did not back down from their stance on panhandling, stating that they originally wanted to implement a blanket ban on the practice as it is a safety hazard and must place the safety of their citizens first. As a response to Omaha's panhandling ordinance, the Open Door Mission has begun to pass out 'compassion cards' for people to give panhandlers instead of money. The cards resemble a business card which guides the individuals to the Open Door Mission and the services they provide including shelter, food, transportation, clothes and toiletries, and are able to pick people up from the corner of 14th and Douglas Streets. New Jersey Begging laws in the state of New Jersey are determined by the ordinances set by each local government. Depending on where an individual is begging the rules and punishments can vary greatly. For example, in Middle Township, it is prohibited to aggressively beg within 100 feet of an ATM, with a first offence punishable by up to a $250 fine, 30 days jail and 5 days community service. Whereas, in New Brunswick, all begging within 25 feet of any bank or ATM is considered aggressive begging, which allows police to issue a cease and desist notice. Failure to comply with the notice may incur a $50 fine for each day of being in violation. In 2013, the local governments of Middle Township and Atlantic City reached national headlines for passing ordinances that require individuals to register for a free yearly permit before being allowed to beg for money in public. Local officials and lawmakers of Middle Township adopted the ordinance in response to complaints from the public in relation to the forceful and persistent tactics used by some panhandlers. However, these begging permits did not last with Middle Township passing amendments that remove the need for permits, and Atlantic City also repealing the permit requirement in April 2016. The constitutionality of anti-begging laws are contested. Bill Dressel of the New Jersey Coalition to End Homelessness explains that \\"it's a complicated area of the law ‚Äì it's in flux\\". Recent judicial decisions in the US Supreme Court have challenged local ordinances that prohibit or regulate panhandling in a way that is too vague. Since the decision of Reed v Town of Gilbert the courts have largely struck down panhandling bans on the grounds that they inappropriately limit the content of the speech of individuals that are panhandling. Supporters of anti-begging laws argue that these ordinances do not curtail free speech as they only seek to regulate the manner of begging rather than what is being said. In 2015, John Fleming, a wheelchair-confined homeless man was arrested in New Brunswick and charged with 'disorderly conduct' for sitting on the sidewalk with a sign that read \\"BROKE ‚Äì PLEASE HELP ‚Äì GOD BLESS YOU ‚Äì THANK YOU\\". The New Jersey chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU‚ÄìNJ) successfully challenged the local ordinance on the grounds it violated a person's First Amendment right to free expression. Deputy legal director of ACLU‚ÄìNJ, Jeanne LoCicero, explained that panhandling, from a constitutional standpoint, is no different to a Girl Scout troop soliciting cookie sales or collecting signatures on a petition. Thus, merely targeting panhandling is problematic as it seeks to prohibit the content of the speech and not the manner of speech. The City of New Brunswick agreed to settle the case by repealing the two ordinances ‚Äì one that required a permit for begging and another banning unauthorised begging ‚Äì as there were \\"legitimate concerns regarding the constitutionality of the Ordinances\\". In Paterson, alleged panhandlers arrested by police are given the chance, after being fingerprinted, to engage with social service programs that address their particular needs. Paterson's Police Director, Jerry Speziale, says that the initiative is a \\"new way to address those in need and enhance the quality of life for all\\". However, community views on panhandling is vexed, with some Paterson council members calling upon the police to crack down on those whom have dropped out of rehabilitation programs and resumed begging. Paterson Councilman, Alex Mendez, raised that it is an issue of weak enforcement and repeated targeting of panhandlers would eliminate the problem. An ongoing police crackdown on panhandling was launched in Newark, in July 2016, seeking to deter panhandling in busy areas of the city. Newark Police Director, Anthony Ambrose, said the days of leniency were over, \\"a panhandler definitely isn't a welcoming sight ... [t]hese operations will continue until the panhandlers get the message\\". Civil rights activists question the legality of the crackdown, citing the successful case of John Fleming and ACLU-NJ in challenging unconstitutional prohibitions on begging. New Mexico Homelessness is a serious issue throughout the state of New Mexico. Through a demographic examination it becomes evident that New Mexico has a high proportion of ethnographies that are currently and historically socioeconomically disadvantaged.Norris, Tina; Vines, Paula L.; Hoeffel, Elizabeth M. (February 2012). \\"The American Indian and Alaska Native Population: 2010\\" (PDF). Census 2010 Brief. United States Census Bureau. Retrieved May 1, 2012. Native Americans as a proportion of the US population represent the second highest amongst all States with only Alaska having a higher ratio, while it also has a large Hispanic population. Homelessness is a direct cause from an individual not being able to provide themselves with the most basic of necessities to maintain a healthy life hence having a higher proportion of individuals in poverty places a greater risk of an individual becoming homeless. A study into cost of homelessness on the state government of New Mexico concluded that, on a per nightly basis, emergency shelter costs $30; supportive housing $33, state penitentiary $77, Santa Fe County Detention Centre $82, St Vincent Hospital $550 and UNM Hospital $71. Homelessness by and large is caused by or as a result of health care complications. One need only consider ailments such as addiction, psychological disorders, HIV/AIDS and an array of other ailments that require consistent long-term care that cannot be well managed in an unsafe, unpredictable environment that confronts most homeless. Inability to adequately manage these medical problems places a further economic burden on the state as the frequency and duration of hospital visits may increase. This phenomenon is evidenced by the fact that on average homeless spent four days longer than comparable non-homeless, costing the State approximately $2,414 per hospitalization. Homelessness causes both serious mental and physical anguish as evidenced by the fact that a homeless person's psychiatric hospitalization rate is 100 times more than their non-homeless compatriot. Due to New Mexico's strong laws against loitering, sleeping in cars and begging (traits a lot of homeless people are forced to do) they are disproportionately over-represented in the prison system. Police officials can accuse any person they believe may have attempted to disrupt the peace, regardless of whether or not the offense presents danger to the community. Panhandling is an umbrella term that represents begging, sponging and spanging. In the state of New Mexico there are strict regulations on panhandling. Moreover, homeless people are prohibited to beg after dark and if they do they are often sent to jail. In an attempt to remove homeless people from the streets, it is common for the police to dispose of their property. The above conditions cause the mere act of being homeless to become a self-perpetuating cycle of crime. New York In 1979, a New York City lawyer, Robert Hayes, brought a class action suit before the courts, Callahan v. Carey, against the City and State, arguing for a person's state constitutional \\"right to shelter\\". It was settled as a consent decree in August 1981. The City and State agreed to provide board and shelter to all homeless men who met the need standard for welfare or who were homeless by certain other standards. By 1983 this right was extended to homeless women. On March 18, 2013, the New York City Department of Homeless Services reported that the sheltered homeless population consisted of: * 27,844 adults * 20,627 children * 48,471 total individuals According to the Coalition for the Homeless, the homeless population of New York rose to an all-time high in 2011. A reported 113,552 people slept in the city's emergency shelters last year, including over 40,000 children; marking an 8 percent increase from the previous year and a 37 percent increase from 2002. There was also a rise in the number of families relying on shelters, approximately 29,000. That is an increase of 80% from 2002. About half of the people who slept in shelter in 2010 returned for housing in 2011. According to the NYC Department of Homeless Services, 64 percent of those applying for emergency shelter in 2010 were denied. Several were denied because they were said to have family who could house them when in actuality this might not have been the case. Applicants may have faced overcrowding, unsafe conditions, or may have had relatives unwilling to house them. According to Mary Brosnaham, spokeswoman for Coalition for the Homeless, the administration of Mayor Michael Bloomberg employs a deliberate policy of \\"active deterrence\\". Part of the problem lies with long-term joblessness that characterizes the United States' economic crisis. According to the Center for an Urban Future about a third of the adult workers in New York City are low-wage earners, making under $11.54 an hour. Affordable rent rates considered to be no more than a third of the renter's wages. A family in New York City must earn at least $54,000 to find an affordable home. The median household income for renters in the Bronx and Brooklyn is barely $30,000 and $35,000 respectively. According to the Community Service Society, \\"Two-thirds of poor New Yorkers and over one-third of near poor households‚Äîup to twice the poverty level‚Äîspend at least half of their incomes on rent ... and place millions of low-income New Yorkers at risk of housing hardships and displacement.\\" The New York City Housing Authority is experiencing record demand for subsidized housing assistance. However, just 13,000 of the 29,000 families who applied were admitted into the public housing system or received federal housing vouchers known as [Section 8] in 2010. Due to budget cuts there have been no new applicants accepted to receive Section 8. In March 2010, there were protests about the Governor's proposed cut of $65 million in annual funding to the homeless adult services system.\\"Council, Public Advocate, Department of Homeless Services, and Coalition for the Homeless unite to oppose State's $65 million cut to the Adult Shelter System\\" , News Brief, NYC Department of Homeless Services, March 23, 2010 The Bloomberg administration announced an immediate halt to the Advantage program, threatening to cast 15,000 families back into the shelters or onto the streets. A court has delayed the cut until May 2011 because there was doubt over the legality of cancelling the city's commitment. However, the Advantage program itself was consciously advanced by the Bloomberg administration as an alternative to providing long-term affordable housing opportunities for the poor and working class. The result, as the Coalition for the Homeless report points out, is that \\"Thousands of formerly-homeless children and families have been forced back into homelessness, In addition, Mayor Bloomberg proposed $37 million in cuts to the city's budget for homeless services this year. In 2004, New York's Department of Homeless Services created HomeBase, a network of neighborhood-based services, to help tenants in housing crisis to remain in their communities and avoid entering shelter. Tenants can visit HomeBase locations within their neighborhoods to receive services to prevent eviction, assistance obtaining public benefits, emergency rental assistance and more. Brooklyn nonprofit CAMBA, Inc operates several HomeBase locations as well as an outfitted \\"You Can Van,\\" which uses data on pending evictions to travel throughout the borough and offer help. =Crimes relating to begging in New York= The administration of laws and regulations relating to begging in the state of New York is largely performed by each of the 62 cities of the state. Many of the state of New York's largest cities have introduced laws in the last decade prohibiting 'aggressive begging' in some form. New York City Administrative Code ¬ß10-136, City of Buffalo Code ¬ß317, City of Rochester Code ¬ß44-4, and Albany Code ¬ß255-59 prohibit forms of 'aggressive begging' which can include, but is not limited to, conduct that is likely to cause a fear of bodily harm, physical contact, approaching or blocking motor vehicles, and being within a certain distance of banks and ATMs. Syracuse City General Ordinances ¬ß16-9 and ¬ß16-11 prohibit lewd solicitation and loitering. The City of Yonkers does not currently have any similar law. New York City also has bans on all begging within the subway system and in airports. This situation of banning specific aggressive elements of panhandling arose because of several challenges to previous begging laws on the grounds of constitutionality. In 1990, the ban on begging in New York City's subway was challenged in Young v. New York City Transit Authority, and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals found that the ban in this case did not infringe on First Amendment rights to free speech. However, this precedent did not last long as it was seemingly overturned in 1993, in Loper v. New York City Police Department. The Loper case was a challenge to the statewide law in the New York Penal Code ¬ß240.35(1) which made it an offence to loiter in a public place for the purpose of begging. New York City Police Department rarely issued fines under this law, but used it to 'move on' beggars. In Loper, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals found begging in this case to be a First Amendment right. And clarified that the ban on the subway system in the Young case was a reasonable limit as, even though it was publicly owned, panhandling in the confined space of the subway system can disrupt and startle passengers and potentially cause harm. Whereas, the blanket ban in all public spaces in the Loper case would leave beggars nowhere else for begging, which was considered an 'expressive activity' and thus protected by the First Amendment. A similar judgement was made in International Society for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Lee in regard to New York City's airports, which found it reasonable to ban such activities in airports. This has led to the distinction between public places and public places that are not public forums. The airports and subways of New York, while being public places, are not public forums as the free exchange of ideas has never been considered its principal purpose, unlike the streets of New York. The Loper judgement is narrow in that it only forbade a blanket ban of begging, in fact it suggested city councils introduce more targeted begging laws, such as those for aggressive begging, and spoke favourably of the laws in Seattle Washington. After the Loper case which found ¬ß240.35(1) of the state's Penal Code to be unconstitutional, the New York City Police Department stopped enforcing that section of the code. However, the law still technically remained in force in the rest of New York state until it was repealed in 2010. This caused some people in New York state to be charged under that section of the law after Loper, but before it was repealed. Civil liberties groups have campaigned against the more targeted aggressive begging laws, however, they have been found to comply with the First Amendment. In 2006, the City of Rochester's current aggressive begging laws withstood a legal challenge in People v. Barton. And in 2010, New York City's current aggressive begging laws also withstood challenge in People v. Stroman. Oregon Rhode Island In June 2012, Governor Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island signed a bill into law that gives homeless people in that state some clearer rights than before.Sennott, Adam, \\"Rhode Island Homeless Bill of Rights: Is Massachusetts Next?\\" , Spare Change News, June 29, 2012 issue Tennessee The act of 'aggressive panhandling' has only recently become criminalized in Tennessee; becoming official in 2015. In recent years, there has been an apparent push for the need to implement anti-panhandling laws across America. It is believed that this is a result of adverse effects of the Great Recession, particularly foreclosure. Under the Tennessee Code (¬ß 39-17-313), the act of 'aggressive panhandling' is classified as a criminal offence punishable by a fine and/or jail. Per the Code, 'aggressive panhandling' is committed if an individual, while requesting money or donations: * intentionally touches a person without their consent * obstructs a person or their vehicle * follows a person after they refuse to give a donation * acts in manner that would cause a 'reasonable person' to feel threatened should they refuse to provide a donation. The severity of the punishment greatly depends on whether an individual has previously violated the Code. A first offence (classified as a Class C misdemeanour) could result in a maximum fine of $50 and/or up to 30 days in jail. A second offence (classified as a Class B misdemeanour) could increase this penalty to a maximum fine of $500 and/or up to 6 months in jail. While the Tennessee Code is written in very broad and general terms, several city ordinances, most of which were enacted before the Tennessee Code, provide specific restraints on the actions of panhandlers. =Memphis= In October 2016, the Memphis City Council voted to extend the ban on panhandling to between 5pm and 10am and to also extend the areas that panhandling is prohibited. Councillor Philip Spinosa Jr. declared that this extension entirely relates to public safety. He stated that the new ordinance was designed to encompass morning and evening rush hours and to make popular begging areas, such as intersections, construction zones, ramps and bridges safer for all involved. In addition to the fines, the police are empowered with the option to charge the panhandler with a misdemeanor crime of obstructing the highway. The president of Homeless Organizing for Power and Equality expressed disappointment of this decision. Memphis Police Director Mike Rallings agreed that while panhandling is a public safety issue, he still believes that the imposition of fines is highly ineffective as most panhandlers, most of whom are homeless, are unable to pay the fine. In response to the strict anti-panhandling laws in place in Memphis, a local not- for-profit organization, Hospitality Hub in partnership with the Memphis City Council has launched a 'Work Local' program. This program aims to reduce poverty in Memphis by offering temporary clean-up work. Texas Half of the homeless population of the U.S. reside in one of five states (in 2020), with Texas having the fourth largest population at 25,000 and California having the largest at 151,000. Begging has been criminalized in a number of regions in the state of Texas. According to the U.S. United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, Texas has seen a decrease of 2.4% in total homelessness since 2015 However, there is still over 25,000 (in 2020) individuals who lack housing and are considered homeless. Of this large population, 7,163 are people in families with children, 1,309 are unaccompanied youths and 1,768 are veterans. Even worse, over 3000 of the homeless population are chronically homeless individuals. In February 2016, the Dallas Police Department implemented an attack on Panhandling in the central area of the city, as announced by Deputy Chief Gary Tittle Because there is controversy around the issue of criminalising panhandling, the target of the police operation was defined as \\"that aggressive panhandler, the one approaching an individual demanding money, asking for money, impeding their walkway on the sidewalks, getting out into the street, on the curbs, moving out into the highway from the shoulder of the highway\\" The crackdown on panhandling and homeless in Texas partially stems from the costs associated, as the cost of healthcare is estimated to be at least $23, 223 per homeless person per year, according to the University of Texas. Furthermore, taxpayers are further paying for the costs of the homeless through the expenses involved with the criminal justice system. These costs are heightened as individuals who are homeless are more often than not convicted for misdemeanours and non-violent offences such as sleeping in public places, loitering, panhandling and trespassing. Unfortunately, it is difficult to gain an understanding of the magnitude of the issue because jails and prisons do not gather data relating to the housing situations of inmates, in this case, homelessness In a positive light, the rate of homelessness across the U.S. decreased overall by .6 per 10,000 from 2014 to 2015. In addition, the majority of states in the U.S. experienced decreases of homelessness in every major subpopulation mentioned, including families, veterans, unaccompanied youths and individuals who experience chronic homelessness. The same issue is also occurring in Worcester, Massachusetts, where the City Manager Michael O'Brien claims he would \\"rather be criticized for putting these types of measures in place to protect public safety than be criticized for tragedy when someobody that's fallen on hard times is collecting pennies and quarters at our intersection and is now in the ICU and may not walk again because they were pinned underneath the car.\\" This statement brings to light another aspect of the panhandling debate; the safety of the individuals themselves. Though a number of States in the U.S., including Texas, have implemented panhandling bans, these have not occurred without their legitimacy being challenged regarding the Constitution. However, San Francisco had effective legislation for prosecution of people found panhandling but this legislation was later found unconstitutional by a federal court in the case of Blair v. Shanahan (1991). It was found that it was a violation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The federal Constitution protects the right to panhandle under free speech clauses, as seen in San Francisco but not Texas due to the laws implemented early 2016 The Houston, Texas area has a civility ordinance affecting the Downtown Central Business District, Midtown Houston, and the Montrose/Neartown area where panhandling and loitering is illegal - this also includes public feeding of the homeless. Elevated highways around the Downtown Houston CBD area (U.S. 59/Interstate 69 adjacent to the George R. Brown Convention Center, Pierce Elevated, and a section of U.S. 59 east of Spur 527 have perimeter fencing where the homeless once congregated. With the laws being challenged yet still in action in many areas, it leaves the place for panhandling in society unknown. Utah In the state of Utah begging or panhandling is not a crime. The first amendment right protects people to ask for money, help or employment on the streets ‚Äì this includes panhandling or begging. Following a lawsuit in 2010 three homeless persons were fined for begging and they took the matter to court and won. The court found that fining people for asking for money violated their right to free speech, thus infringing upon the first amendment. In 2010 Salt Lake City agreed not to enforce the state panhandling restriction and therefore law enforcement were not allowed to ticket homeless people panhandling alongside motorways or begging on the street. However, the first amendment right only protects the panhandler if they are on sidewalks or on the side of the roadways ‚Äì if you get caught panhandling in the road ways, it's a misdemeanour charge that can cost up to $100 or more depending on how many times you get caught. This is because it's a safety issue and people are often hit at traffic lights when they turn green. Homelessness and panhandling in Utah was a major issue in 2005, and the city implemented a 10-year plan hoping to eradicate homelessness by 2015. Though they have not completely stopped homelessness, the state has been extremely successful at reducing homelessness by 91%. In 2005 there were over 1,932 chronically homeless persons in Utah and in 2015 this figure has dropped to a staggering 178 people. However, unlike many other states across the U.S., the state government did not implement hardline laws to breakdown its homelessness problem through fining, prosecuting or 'moving on'; but implemented a simple solution to the complex problem which was the 'housing first' program. The primary focus was to put homeless people into housing first, and then help them deal with the underlying issues that made them became homeless from addictions, mental health and health care. The last step is then to help them find employment. Studies have shown investing in homes for the homeless actually saves money in the long run. It cost approximately $19,208 a year for the state to take care of its homeless people. This is through hospital visits, time in custody, shelter time and ambulance callouts. In comparison, it only cost approximately $7,800 a year for the state to provide a house and holistic case management. Critics say this solution may intensify laziness, however residents need to pay rent which is 30% of their income or $50 a month, whatever amount is greater. A reason behind the Utah success in eliminating homelessness can be attributed to an array of factors. Comparatively to other states such as California, Utah is quite small with a total population of 2,995,919 residents. It is also one of the least densely populated states in the U.S. Furthermore, Utah has the 14th highest median average income and remarkably has the least income inequality of any U.S. state. Comparatively, homelessness in San Francisco is a major current issue. This is because it's the second most densely populated city in USA with large income inequality due to high rent and cost of living therefore making it a lot more difficult to implement the 'housing first' model of Utah. Overall, Utah has been quite progressive in its response to panhandling and begging, firstly by not considering it a crime and secondly by implementing the successful housing first program. Virginia The laws and regulations around panhandling in Virginia vary greatly between cities and counties within the state. Some prohibit panhandling in specific areas (such as shopping centres and intersections), other counties have proposed the possibility of permits, and others are still very unclear on their position both in legislation and enforcement. Generally, exclusions for panhandling may include on public streets, if impeding traffic, within 50 feet of a retailer, or on sidewalks of a certain size. Furthermore, activities such as playing loud music and preventing the movement of others are also prohibited. Some laws are said to be in place to reduce public harassment caused by people asking for money. The city of Manassas, Virginia goes into more detail about its definitions around panhandling regulations. Specifically, it prohibits an aggressive manner which is explained as the persistent requesting of money after the person being solicited has made a negative response that induces some sort of fear or intimidation. It further prohibits intentionally blocking or interfering with the passage of another person, and abusive language or gestures. The city of Manassas also lists a number of intersections that prohibits panhandling within 150 feet. Other cities in Virginia vary in their regulations, for example, the City of Colonial Heights takes a preventative approach, although it does not state specifically how it would work to provide the prevention of street begging, whether through law enforcement or social assistance policies. The Lee County, Virginia, in Jonesville, has a much stronger approach in their legislation aiming to 'restrain and punish' begging. Tazewell County, Virginia and the City of Buena Vista, Virginia both merely state that begging is prohibited without expanding much further. In some counties in Virginia, there was discussion proposals to introduce permits for panhandlers. Permits proposed would be required for people verbally asking for donations, as well as actions and behaviours requesting donations within a public space. The idea has been quite contentious. Some media reports reflect calls for increased enforcement of laws against panhandlers, and others report that the ban on panhandling in public spaces is against the civil liberties of individuals, and unconstitutional as it infringes on the First Amendment. In regards to the permit proposal, community opinion was split, with some calling strongly for the implementation of a $25 permit that would need to be carried by panhandlers. The proposal is yet to be approved, with many opposing the idea, questioning where people would be able to get the money and documents required to purchase the permit, who would be allowed to attain a permit and who would be excluded, and how these permits would restrict the accessibility, and monitor the livelihoods of, panhandlers. A lot of the calls for increasing panhandling restrictions are reporting that it is for the safety of people engaging in panhandling, and for motorists in regards to begging on motorways. However, the Arlington Police Department in Virginia reportedly discouraged citizens from giving to panhandlers in the area, in that \\"there's no telling what the cash will be used for\\". While many are discouraging giving to panhandlers on motorways due to the context of 'risk', they also appear to portray an underlining negative bias and view of illegitimacy toward people who engage in panhandling. As police in some counties cannot directly arrest someone for begging, the Arlington Police Department note that they do arrest panhandlers for other offences for jaywalking and other traffic related offences. This was mirrored in a media article in Chesterfield, VA, where it was reported in 2011 that 14 panhandlers were arrested for steeping on to the street under traffic offenses. The laws and regulations in Virginia are incredibly varied, making it difficult for panhandlers to know their rights and legitimacy in the area, particularly if one does not have access to the resources in order to find this information. Even within the legislation, the definitions and language tends to be of a broad and very subjective nature. There is also conflicting motivations for further restricting panhandling in the area, with discourses around both the safety as well as the legitimacy of panhandling taking place, particularly in the local media.

Washington City Paper, October 29, 2013. Homeless advocates Mitch Snyder and Eric Sheptock come from D.C. Washington state The many cities within Washington each have differing laws when it comes to begging and other associated crimes. While begging is protected under the First Amendment, certain cities have attempted to find ambiguity's in this right to freedom of speech, while others use more discretion when it comes to panhandling. The city of Tacoma has passed laws which have quashed any form of panhandling in public forums. Panhandling is banned anywhere which is within 15 feet of ATMs, bus stops, pay phones, parked cars, gas stations, outdoor stations, cafes and carwashes within the city. More specifically, it is illegal on buses, freeway ramps and on intersections. Moreover, in the hours between sunset and sunrise, it is prohibited entirely. Those who are found to be in breach of this ordinance could be penalized with 90 days in jail or be fined $1000. While the city of Arlington's laws are not as strict, with panhandling being banned anywhere within 300 feet of these certain areas, violators too can be met with the same harsh forms of punishment. A more controversial law was passed in October 2015, when the city of Everett amended previous code which categorised 'aggressive panhandling' as just a misdemeanour. This new law prevents begging 'in a manner that hinders or obstructs the free passage of any person in a public place' or begging that 'intentionally causes or attempts to cause another person to reasonably fear imminent bodily harm or the commission of a criminal act upon their person, or upon property in their immediate possession.' The passing of the law has been met with mass condemnation, with many critics saying it criminalizes homelessness, while the ACLU called it 'unconstitutional, ineffective and unnecessarily costly and punitive.' Further opposition to criminalising begging was demonstrated recently when the city of Lakewood's anti-panhandling ordinance was deemed unconstitutional in the case The City of Lakewood v Robert W. Willis. Laws were considered 'overbroad' by the courts as they restrict panhandling in several locations without seeing if there is actually obstruction of traffic. This case has also led to a discussion surrounding whether to charge an individual with obstructing traffic or with begging. =City of Seattle= The city of Seattle's stance on panhandling is not as hardline as many other cities in Washington. For example, in 2010 an amendment was sponsored which would enable stronger panhandling laws that included a regulation against 'intimidating words and gestures' and obstructing someone's walking path. Moreover, a $50 fine was proposed to be the punishment for anyone found to be 'aggressively panhandling.' While the bill was initially passed, Mayor Mike McGinn vetoed the bill. Yet despite this opposition to a call for certain regulations on panhandling, Mayor Ed Murray believed that it is imperative that existing laws are enforced. These current laws were enacted in 1987 and they are effectively an ordinance against aggressive panhandling. While this does represent similarities with Everett's laws, the laws in Seattle have been seen as largely discretionary and 'feel good legislation' which have been viewed ambiguously. There are about 8,000 homeless individuals in Seattle on an average day. The \\"One Night Count\\" in 2015 found 10,047 individuals homeless in the 3rd week in January, in King County. 3,772 individuals were without shelter in King County. 2,804 were without shelter in Seattle.

Also, included in this list is the Montezuma Castle National Monument and the Montezuma Well which are close to Camp Verde and which are also listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Brief history During the Pre-Columbian era, the area was occupied by Sinagua people who built their dwellings in the cliffs of the Verde Valley Mountains between the years of 1100 and 1425 AD. In 1583, Captain Antonio de Espejo and the Spanish conquistadors took possession of the Verde Valley.Overview of the town of Camp Verde In the 1860s settlers began to migrate into the Verde Valley to work in the mining industry. The United States Army established a minor post overlooking the farms which the settlers established in West Clear Water. A post called Camp Lincoln, which later was renamed Camp Verde, was established . In 1871, General George Crook established a military supply trail which connected Forts Whipple, Verde and Apache. There is marker to this effect located by the administration building in Camp Verde. In 1878, the camp became known as Fort Verde and remained occupied by the military until 1891.Camp Verde History In 1956, members of the community established a museum in the abandoned administration building of the fort. They restored some of the historic fort buildings and requested the establishment of a Historic State Park. The Arizona State Parks governmental agency protects and preserves said parks.Arizona State Parks The site was officially designated a Historic State Park in 1970. In 1971, the Camp Verde Historical Society was founded. It is located at 435 South Main Street. The main objective of the society is to restore, preserve, reconstruct, and administer buildings and sites of historical significance in the Camp Verde area. The society also houses archival materials going back to the 1860s and maintains a research library.Camp Verde Historical Society The town of Camp Verde was formally incorporated in 1986. Camp Verde however does not have the authority to deny a demolition permit. Therefore, the owner of a property, listed either in the National Register of Historic Places or considered historical by the Camp Verde Historical Society, may demolish the historical property in question if he or she so desires.

Etymology  Epopeus name means 'all- seer', from epopao, 'to look out', 'observe', in turn from epi, 'over' and ops, 'eye'. A suitable for one who is to be a king and oversee his people.  Family  Epopeus was the son of Poseidon either by Canace, daughter of AeolusPseudo-Apollodorus. Bibliotheca, 1.7.4, or by the Pleiad AlcyoneGaius Julius Hyginus Praef. Fab. p. 11, ed. Staveren. Yet, in some accounts, his father was Aloeus, son of Helius. Epopeus married Antiope by whom he had children: Oenope and Marathon.  Mythology  Epopeus was the most memorable king at Sicyon and features in Euripides' Antiope. He founded a sanctuary of Athena on the Sicyonian acropolis where he performed victory rites, celebrating his defeat of Theban intruders. Athena caused olive oil to flow before the shrine. At Titane in Sicyonia, Pausanias saw an altar, in front of it a tumulus raised to the hero Epopeus, and, near to the barrow-tomb, the \\"Gods of Aversion\\"‚Äîthe apotropai‚Äî\\"before whom are performed the ceremonies which the Hellenes observe for the averting of evils\\".Pausanias, 2.11.1. In the etiological myth that accounted for the origin of rituals propitiating the daimon of Epopeus, it was told that Zeus impregnated the daughter of Nycteus, Antiope, who fled in shame to Epopeus, king of Sicyon, abandoning her children, Amphion and Zethus. They were exposed on Mount Cithaeron, but, in a familiar mytheme, were found and brought up by a shepherd. Unable to retrieve his daughter Nycteus made war with Epopeus, but was wounded by the latter and carried back to Thebes. Before Nycteus died, he sent his brother Lycus to take Antiope. this time Epopeus was killed in battle by Lycus, or he died of a neglected wound that he received when his army defeated Nycteus. Lycus then gave his niece as a slave to his own wife, Dirce.Hyginus. Fabulae, 157Pseudo- Apollodorus. Bibliotheca, 3.5.5Pausanias.

It was approved for medical use in the United States and in the European Union in 2019, and was developed by the biotech company AbbVie. Common side effects include upper respiratory tract infections (common cold, sinus infections), nausea, cough, and fever. Upadacitinib works by blocking the action of enzymes called Janus kinases. These enzymes are involved in setting up processes that lead to inflammation, and blocking their effect brings inflammation in the joints under control. Medical uses Upadacitinib is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adults who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Upadacitinib may be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate. Contraindications The drug is contraindicated in people with active tuberculosis and other severe infections, severe liver impairment (Child‚ÄìPugh score C), and during pregnancy. The use of upadacitinib in combination with other Janus kinase inhibitors, biologic DMARDs, or with potent immunosuppressants such as azathioprine and ciclosporin is not recommended. Interactions Substances that strongly inhibit the liver enzyme CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole or clarithromycin, increase upadacitinib concentrations in the body. In a study, ketoconazole increased its AUC by 75%. Conversely, substances that strongly induce CYP3A4 lower upadacitinib concentrations. For example, rifampicin reduced the AUC by 60% in a study. Upadacitinib seems to be a weak inducer of CYP3A4, as it lowers concentrations of other substrates of this enzyme (such as the midazolam AUC by 26%). It has no effect on substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 or CYP2D6. Side effects Common side effects are upper respiratory tract infections such as common cold and sinus infections (13.5% of patients in studies), nausea (3.5%), cough (2.2%), fever, and increased liver enzymes. Serious side effects include infections, including life-threatening ones, such as pneumonia, cellulitis, tuberculosis, as well as shingles and other herpes infections. Pharmacology =Mechanism of action= The Janus kinases (JAKs) are a family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases whose function is to transduce cytokine-mediated signals via the JAK-STAT pathway. There are four JAK subtypes, each of which has overlapping receptor responsibilities. Inhibitors of this enzyme family (jakinibs) have shown efficacy in treating certain inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. However, the first generation of these drugs, tofacitinib and ruxolitinib, lacked subtype selectivity, affecting JAK1/JAK3 and JAK1/JAK2 respectively. This has led to dose-limiting side effects in this otherwise promising class of drugs. Upadacitinib is a second generation Janus kinase inhibitor that is selective for the JAK1 subtype of this enzyme over the JAK2 (74-fold), JAK3 (58-fold) and tyrosine kinase 2 subtypes. =Pharmacokinetics= After oral intake, upadacitinib reaches highest concentrations in the blood plasma after two to four hours. A fatty meal has no clinically relevant effect on its resorption. Steady-state conditions are reached after four days; accumulation is minimal. There is no significant first pass effect. When in the bloodstream, 52% of the substance are bound to plasma proteins. It is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4, and possibly to a minor extent by CYP2D6. The most important pathway consists of oxidation to a carboxylic acid and subsequent glucuronidation, yielding a metabolite called M4. However, 79% of the drug are circulating in form of upadacitinib itself, and only 13% as M4. Other metabolites are only present in small fractions. None are pharmacologically active. The drug is excreted mainly as the original substance, of which 38% are found in the feces and 24% in the urine. The mean terminal half-life is 9 to 14 hours. Clinical trials =Phase I studies= A phase I study revealed that upadacitinib followed a bi-exponential disposition with a terminal half-life of 6‚Äì16 hours. There was no significant accumulation over the dose range of 3‚Äì36 mg per day. No interaction was found in rheumatoid arthritis patients taking methotrexate. The most common adverse event was headache but its incidence was similar to that when taking placebo (15.6% for upadacitinib vs. 16.7% for placebo). An investigation into absorption and metabolism found that dosing after a high-fat meal had no effect on upadacitinib total drug exposure over time (area under the curve or AUC). Inhibition of CYP3A by ketoconazole increased total AUC, indicating the importance of this metabolic route. =Phase II studies= Two phase IIb studies were initiated to study the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and one phase II study was initiated in patients with Crohn's disease. BALANCE I In the first study, 276 rheumatoid arthritis patients were recruited who had previously experienced inadequate response to anti‚Äìtumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy and were currently on a stable dose of methotrexate. Patients were randomized to receive 3, 6, 12, or 18 mg twice daily or placebo. The primary endpoint was a 20% improvement in symptoms according to the American College of Rheumatology improvement criteria (ACR20). At the completion of the study it was found that response rates were significantly higher in those receiving upadacitinib versus in those receiving placebo alone (36‚Äì42% and 22‚Äì 26%, respectively). Adverse events included headache, nausea, and infection but no infections were serious. BALANCE II In the second phase IIb study, 300 rheumatoid arthritis patients were recruited who have had an inadequate response to methotrexate. Patients were randomized to receive 3, 6, 12, or 18 mg twice daily or placebo. The primary endpoint was a 20% improvement in symptoms according to the American College of Rheumatology improvement criteria (ACR20). At the completion of the study it was found that response rates were significantly higher in those receiving upadacitinib versus in those receiving placebo alone. (62%, 68%, 80%, 64%, and 76% for the 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 mg doses, respectively) than with placebo (46%). Improvement in symptoms was rapid, with significant changes in disease scores by week 2. Adverse events were mild with infection being the most serious. One case of community- acquired pneumonia occurred at 12 mg. CELEST In this 16-week study, 220 patients were recruited with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease. Participants must have also experienced an inadequate response to or intolerance to Immunotherapy or TNF inhibitors. Patients were randomized to therapy with upadacitinib at 3, 6, 12, 24 mg twice daily or 24 mg once daily for 16 weeks or placebo, followed by blinded extension therapy for 36 weeks. The co-primary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved clinical remission (soft stool frequency or daily abdominal pain score) at week 16 and endoscopic remission at week 12 or 16. Secondary endpoints included significant clinical response (‚â•30% reduction in symptoms) at week 16 and endoscopic response (‚â•25% decrease in symptoms) at week 12 or 16. At 16 weeks 22% of patients taking the 24 mg twice daily dose achieved endoscopic remission with upadacitinib compared to 0% of patients taking placebo. 27% of patients taking the 6 mg twice daily dose achieved clinical remission compared to 11% of patients taking placebo. Adverse events did not appear to be dose- related. A single case of non-melanoma skin cancer was reported in the 24 mg twice daily group. =Phase III studies= Abbvie has planned a total of six phase III trials that will evaluate over 4,000 patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis.Phase 3 upadacitinib trials Two Phase III trials are planned studying participants with psoriatic arthritis and one in participants with ulcerative colitis. SELECT-COMPARE In SELECT-COMPARE 1629 patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis and inadequate response to methotrexate were randomized (2:2:1) to once-daily upadacitinib 15mg, placebo, or adalimumab 40mg, on stable background methotrexate. Primary endpoints were ACR20 and DAS28CRP<2.6 versus placebo at week 12; inhibition of radiographic progression was evaluated at week 26. The study was designed and powered to test for non-inferiority and superiority of upadacitinib versus adalimumab clinically and functionally. At week 12, both primary endpoints were met for upadacitinib versus placebo (p‚â§0.001). ACR20 was achieved by 71% versus 36%, and DAS28CRP<2.6 by 29% versus 6%. Upadacitinib was superior to adalimumab for ACR50, DAS28CRP‚â§3.2, ŒîPain and ŒîHAQDI. At week 26, more patients on upadacitinib vs placebo or adalimumab achieved low disease activity or remission (p‚â§0.001). Radiographic progression was less and observed in fewer patients receiving upadacitinib versus placebo (p‚â§0.001). Up to week 26, adverse events (AEs) including serious infections were comparable for upadacitinib and adalimumab. The proportions of patients with serious AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation were highest for adalimumab; the proportion with herpes zoster and CPK elevations was highest for upadacitinib. Three malignancies, five MACE, and four deaths were reported, none on upadacitinib. Six venous thromboembolic events were reported [placebo, one; upadacitinib, two; adalimumab, three]. Upadacitinib was superior to placebo and adalimumab for improving signs, symptoms and physical function in RA patients on background methotrexate, and significantly inhibited radiographic progression versus placebo, while the overall safety profile was generally similar to adalimumab, except for higher rates of herpes zoster and CPK elevations on upadacitinib. History Upadacitinib was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2019. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved upadacitinib based on evidence from five clinical trials (Trial 1/NCT02706873, Trial 2/NCT02706951, Trial 3/NCT02675426, Trial 4/NCT02629159, Trial 5/NCT02706847) of 3,141 participants with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The trials were conducted in Australia, New Zealand, Israel, South Africa, Asia, North/Central/South America, and Europe. Five trials established the benefits and side effects of upadacitinib. Trials enrolled participants with moderate to severe active RA in whom disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDS) did not work well or could not be tolerated. All participants had at least six tender and six swollen joints, and increased levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). hsCRP is a substance produced by the body to protect itself from illness. Trials lasted up to 5 years. Trial 1 enrolled participants who had never been treated with MTX. Participants were randomly assigned to receive one of two doses of upadacitinib or MTX daily for 24 weeks. Neither the subject nor the healthcare providers knew which medication was being given until after this 24-week treatment period. Trial 2 enrolled participants in whom MTX did not work well. Participants were randomly assigned to receive one of two doses of upadacitinib daily by mouth or continue their usual dose of MTX for 14 weeks. At week 14, participants who were assigned to MTX received upadacitinib by mouth daily. Neither the subject nor the healthcare providers knew which medication was being given. Trial 3 enrolled participants in whom DMARDS did not work well. Participants were randomly assigned to receive one of two doses of upadacitinib or placebo daily by mouth in addition to DMARDS for 12 weeks. At week 12, participants who received placebo were re-assigned to upadacitinib daily. Neither the subject nor the healthcare providers knew which medication was being given. Trial 4 enrolled participants in whom MTX did not work well. Participants were randomly assigned to receive upadacitinib or placebo daily by mouth in addition to MTX for 14 weeks. Participants receiving placebo who did not have adequate improvement of signs and/or symptoms could be switched to upadacitinib after week 14. At week 26, all participants receiving placebo were switched to upadacitinib once daily by mouth. Neither the subject nor the healthcare providers knew which medication was being given. Trial 5 enrolled participants in whom DMARDS did not work well or could not be tolerated. Participants were randomly assigned to receive one of two doses of upadacitinib or placebo treatment daily added to DMARDs for 12 weeks. At week 12, participants who received placebo were re-assigned to upadacitinib daily. The benefit of upadacitinib was measured by comparing the proportion of participants treated with upadacitinib who achieved an American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20) response at week 12 or week 14 to the proportion of participants treated with MTX or placebo who achieved an ACR20 response. ACR20 is a 20% improvement in signs and symptoms of RA. Upadacitinib was approved for medical use in the European Union in December 2019.

He was suffect consul in 151 with Publius Julius Nauto as his colleague.Werner Eck, \\"Die Fasti consulares der Regungszeit des Antoninus Pius, eine Bestandsaufnahme seit G√©za Alf√∂ldys Konsulat und Senatorenstand\\" in Studia epigraphica in memoriam G√©za Alf√∂ldy, hg. W. Eck, B. Feher, and P. Kov√°cs (Bonn, 2013), p. 76 Justus is known primarily through surviving inscriptions, although he could be identical with the Curtius Justus mentioned as a scriptor rei rusticae by Gargilius Martialis (2.1.4,7).Anthony R. Birley, The Fasti of Roman Britain, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981), p. 253  Life  Based on his membership in the Pollia tribe, Justus' origin is thought to be in north Italy. His cursus honorum is known from an inscription set up at Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa in modern Romania. His career began in his teens as one of the quattuorviri viarum curandarum, or overseers of the maintenance of the public roads of Rome. This was one of the four boards that comprised the vigintiviri; membership in the vigintiviri was a preliminary and required first step toward a gaining entry into the Roman Senate. Next Justus was elected quaestor, which he served this at Rome, and upon completion of this traditional Republican magistracy he would be enrolled in the Senate. After this Hadrian adlected him inter tribunicos. Justus completed this portion of his Senatorial career as peregrine praetor. Justus served what Anthony Birley considered \\"a rather lengthy series of appointments between the praetorship and consulship\\". First were a series of appointments in Rome: sevir equitum Romanorum, praefectus frumenti dandi, and curator of several Italians roads -- the via Clodia, Annia, Cassia and Ciminia. This was followed with a commission as legatus or commander of Legio XX Valeria Victrix during the reign of Antoninus Pius, which at the time was stationed in Roman Britain. and proconsul later that reign of a public province, most likely Sicily,The inscription is known only in a 16th-century manuscript, which reads \\"Colliae\\" at this point. Alf√∂ldy restores this as \\"Sicilia\\", instead of Achaea. (Konsulat und Senatorenstand unter den Antoninen, (Bonn: Habelt Verlag, 1977), , pp. 156, 262) then governor of Dacia.Birley, The Fasti, p. 252 In a footnote, Birley cites Werner Eck as observing that none of the ten known praefectura frumenti dandi of the period AD 70-138 continued to a consular office.Birley, The Fasti, p. 252 n. 5 Dates for the last three offices can be inferred. Working backwards, since he was governor of Dacia prior to being suffect consul, and his tenure probably lasted three years, we can surmise he was governor c. 147-c. 150; this was preceded by a year as proconsul; his time with Legio XX Valeria Victrix, Birley concludes, \\"may thus have coincided with the campaigns of Quintus Lollius Urbicus, but, at all events, may be assigned to the early or mid-140s.\\" Working forwards, since his adlection was an act of Hadrian, his praetorship was, at the latest, not very long after 138 the year of Hadrian's death; G√©za Alf√∂ldy dates this magistracy around the year 135.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 343 An inscription found in Milan also attests that Justus was a member of the sodales Augustales, a prominent Roman priesthood. Justus is known to have held one consular post, governor of Moesia Superior; his tenure is attested by an incomplete military diploma that can be dated to either 158 or 159.Alf√∂ldy, Konsulat und Senatorenstand, p. 234  Family  Although the name of his wife is not known, her existence can be inferred from the presence of Gaius Curtius Pollia Rufinus, tribunus laticlavius of Legio XIII Gemina, which was stationed in Dacia during Justus' governorship.

It was held to determine the winner of the 2017 season of the Indian Premier League, an annual Twenty20 tournament in India. Mumbai, playing in their fourth IPL final, defeated Pune by 1 run to win their third title. Mumbai's Krunal Pandya was awarded man of the match award for his innings of 47. The final was sold out, with a final attendance of 59,567.  Road to the final  = League stage = Mumbai and Pune were ranked first and second respectively on the league table. Mumbai had a successful first half of the season, winning six out of six matches after their opening game defeat to Pune. They managed four wins in the second half of the league stage, and finished on top of the league table with 20 points. Mumbai's success in the first half of the season was built around contributions from various batsmen, Nitish Rana and Jos Buttler in particular, as well as Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah and Krunal Pandya among the bowlers. However, in the first week of May, Mumbai replaced Buttler, who was to leave for national duty after the league stage, with Lendl Simmons to open the innings, while Rana had a loss of form that led to him being benched, and Pandya was sidelined for over ten days with an injury. Pune began the season with three defeats in their first four games, with their inexperienced bowling lineup and multimillion-dollar signing Ben Stokes struggling. After this, Pune formed a settled bowling attack led by Jaydev Unadkat, Shardul Thakur, Stokes and Imran Tahir, and went on to win eight of their remaining ten matches. Stokes turned out to be a match-winner with both bat and ball, winning three man of the match awards, while Rahul Tripathi and captain Steve Smith produced consistent performances with the bat. The team was also buoyed by 17-year-old Washington Sundar's economical bowling and Manoj Tiwary's lower-order cameos, but had Stokes and Tahir departing for their respective countries on national duty at the end of the league stage.  League stage series  Pune won both league stage meetings against Mumbai. In the first meeting at Pune, Mumbai posted 184/8 in 20 overs after being put into bat, largely thanks to Hardik Pandya's 35 not out off 15 balls coming in at number eight. Pune then chased down the total in the final over, having lost only three wickets, with captain Smith top-scoring with an unbeaten 84 and Ajinkya Rahane scoring a 34-ball 60. In the second encounter between the two teams, Mumbai opted to field first, having prior to the match won all five games in the season in which they batted second. Pune put up 160/6 on the board, Tripathi top-scoring with 45. Mumbai, in reply, could manage only 157/8 in 20 overs, falling short by 3 runs despite captain Rohit Sharma's 58 off 39 balls. This ended Mumbai's six-match winning streak; Stokes won man of the match for his bowling figures of 2/21 in 4 overs. = Playoff stage = The playoff stage was played according to the Page playoff system and provided Mumbai and Pune, being the top- and second-ranked teams, with two ways of qualifying for the Final. They first faced each other in Qualifier 1, where the winners would qualify for the Final. The losers of Qualifier 1 would play against the winners of the Eliminator in Qualifier 2; the winners of this match would also qualify for the Final. The Qualifier 1 was played at the Wankhede Stadium, home ground of Mumbai, where the home team won the toss and elected to bowl first at a venue favorable to teams batting second. Pune were reduced to 9 for 2 after the first two overs, with their top two batsmen of the season Tripathi and Smith dismissed for 0 and 1 respectively. Rahane and Tiwary then put up an 80-run partnership for the third wicket, scoring at close to 8 runs per over. After the fall of Rahane for 56 in the 13th over, Tiwary and MS Dhoni initially struggled to score freely on the \\"slow\\" and \\"two-paced\\" pitch and the score read 121/3 after 18 overs. The last two overs, however, yielded 41 runs which included 26 runs off the penultimate over by McClenaghan. Dhoni remained unbeaten on 40 from 26 balls with five sixes, whereas Tiwary was dismissed run out off the last ball of the innings for 58. Pune's total of 162 was thought to be \\"below par\\". In reply, the Mumbai runchase started on a positive note with Parthiv Patel batting aggressively in the powerplay. The run out of Simmons in the fifth over was followed by off- spinner Sundar taking three wickets (captain Sharma, Ambati Rayudu and Kieron Pollard) in two overs. Mumbai continued losing wickets at regular intervals and could only manage to score 142/9 in their 20 overs, falling short by 20 runs. Pune thus advanced to the Final for the first time and completed a hat- trick of wins over Mumbai in the season; Sundar won man of the match for his bowling efforts (3/16 in 4 overs). In Qualifier 2 at Bangalore, Mumbai took on the Kolkata Knight Riders who had knocked out defending champions Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Eliminator. Sharma won the toss again and elected to field keeping in mind the possibility of rain which had affected the Eliminator. The bowlers backed the captain's decision by taking early wickets to reduce Kolkata to 31/5 after 7 overs. Ishank Jaggi and Suryakumar Yadav offered some resistance for Kolkata who were eventually bowled out for 107 in the 19th over. For Mumbai, leg-spinner Karn Sharma took 4 for 16 while Bumrah took 3 for 7. In their runchase Mumbai were in a precarious position of 34/3, before Krunal Pandya came to the crease and guided them to victory with an unbeaten 30-ball 45. Mumbai qualified for the Final with this win, setting up the season's fourth encounter with cross-expressway rivals Pune.  Final  = Background = The final was played at the neutral venue of Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium, Hyderabad, the home of the previous season champions. This was Mumbai Indians' fourth appearance in an IPL final, having won twice and lost once in the finals before. The Rising Pune Supergiant, in their second and final year in the IPL, were playing in their first final. Pune led the overall head-to-head record 4‚Äì1, and had beaten Mumbai in all three previous meetings in the season. Pune were without Ben Stokes, the leader of the Most Valuable Player of the season, and Mumbai without Jos Buttler for the final. Both players were recalled by the England and Wales Cricket Board at the conclusion of the league stage to join a training camp in Spain ahead of the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy. Pune also missed the services of their premier spinner Imran Tahir who had returned to South Africa for England tour and Champions Trophy preparation. Mumbai's leading wicket-taker of the season Mitchell McClenaghan, who had missed Qualifier 2 with an injury, was ruled out of the final as well. = Report = Mumbai captain Rohit Sharma won the toss and elected to bat first on what he believed to be a \\"good pitch\\" which \\"plays a little slower in the second innings\\"; Pune captain Steve Smith said he would also have batted first. Both teams were unchanged from their respective previous matches. Mumbai made a poor start to their innings, losing both openers to Jaydev Unadkat in the third over of the innings. As the run rate slowed down, Sharma looked to counter-attack and struck four boundaries off Lockie Ferguson in the last over of powerplay. Ferguson came back to remove Ambati Rayudu in his next over, while Adam Zampa got the wickets of Sharma and Kieron Pollard in the 11th over. The form continued as they made it to 81 for 7 after 15 overs. The last recognised batsman Krunal Pandya then scored rapidly, making 47 runs from 38 deliveries, with tail-end support from Australian Mitchell Johnson who scored 13. Mumbai's innings concluded at 129 for 8 in 20 overs. Pune started positively in their runchase, despite losing Rahul Tripathi early in the innings. After being dropped on 14, Ajinkya Rahane made 44 from 38 deliveries, putting up a 54-run partnership with Smith which ended with Rahane's dismissal in the 12th over. Economical bowling from Mumbai bowlers restricted Pune to 83 for 2 after 15 overs, leaving them 47 to get from the last 5 overs. Pune struck 14 runs in the 16th over to tilt the match in their favour, before Jasprit Bumrah dismissed MS Dhoni in the next over in which he conceded only 3 runs. Pune reached 119 for 3 at the end of 19 overs with a six from Smith off the penultimate ball of the penultimate over, and the equation read 11 runs to get in the final over to be bowled by Johnson. Manoj Tiwary struck a four off the first ball, before he and Smith were dismissed caught in the deep in the next two deliveries. A drop catch off the penultimate ball allowed Pune to get two runs and come within four runs of the target with one ball to go. On the final ball of the innings, Dan Christian ran two and Washington Sundar was run out attempting a third run, resulting in a thrilling one-run victory for Mumbai Indians.  Scorecard  = Summary = It was Mumbai's third IPL title, making them the first team to have won the IPL title more than twice. Mumbai's total of 129 was also the lowest winning total in the first innings of an IPL final. Krunal Pandya was awarded man of the match for his 38-ball 47. Pune all-rounder Stokes won the Most Valuable Player award for the season. Mumbai won a prize money of 15 crore for becoming the champions, while runners-up Pune were awarded 10 crore.

When he next played for Austria in 1992 it was in another World Group qualifier, against Canada in Vancouver. He teamed up with Alex Antonitsch to beat Grant Connell and Glenn Michibata in the doubles, over five sets, which gave Austria a 2‚Äì1 lead. Antonitsch then won in the reverse singles to secure Austria's place in the World Group for 1993. On the ATP Tour, Mandl made it to as high as 186 in the world, twice reaching the second round at the Austrian Open Kitzb√ºhel and once in Munich. In doubles he was a quarter-finalist at Kitzbuhel in 1996 with Georg Blumauer. His only Grand Slam main draw appearance was in doubles, partnering Macedonian player Aleksandar Kitinov at the 1996 Wimbledon Championships. They had to battle through the qualifying rounds, securing a spot in the main draw with a five set win, before they were beaten in the first round by Richey Reneberg and Jim Grabb. After a four year absence he was selected for the Davis Cup again in 1997, for a tie against Zimbabwe. He played his fourth and final tie in Israel the following year and finished with a 2/4 overall record in Davis Cup matches. Mandl now runs a tennis academy in Salzburg. He is a former coach of Anke Huber and Barbara Schett.

Early life and education Prezent was born in 1902 in the town of Toropets in a Jewish family. His father owned a shop in Zapadnaya Dvina. Prezent went to high school in Dukhovshschina, and after completing it in 1919, he returned to Zapadnaya Dvina to teach in a local railway school. He became a communist activist while still in high school. Parallel with being a teacher in Zapadnaya Dvina, he helped found a local branch of Komsomol, and was finally accepted as a party member in 1921. Later that year he moved to Pskov to assume a gubernatorial- level party function. Following a party decision, he enrolled at Leningrad State University (LGU) in 1922. He temporarily left university in 1923 to take part in the late stages of the Civil War as a political instructor. He soon resumed his studies, and graduated from Faculty of Social Sciences of LGU in 1926. As a recognition for his work on biology, he was awarded a doctorate in biological sciences in 1936. Career After graduating, Prezent worked on achieving transition from social sciences to biology by acquainting himself to some of the lead Soviet biologists of the time, including geneticist Nikolai Vavilov. Prezent even briefly worked for Vavilov at the Institute of Plant Industry. However, the two would later become major adversaries, once Prezent joined Lysenko and denounced genetics. After leaving Vavilov, Prezent started teaching at Herzen Pedagogical Institute, where he quickly rose through the academic ranks and became a docent within a couple of years. At the same time, he was active in the Scientific Society of Marxists (NOM, initialism for Nauchno obshchestvo marksistov). There he co-headed the group focused on biology. In 1930, NOM was merged into the Communist Academy, and in that or following year Prezent assumed a position of the head of biology sector of the natural science section of the Leningrad branch of Communist Academy. In 1931, he started teaching dialectics of nature and evolutionary studies at LGU, parallel with his activities in the Communist Academy. In this early part of his career, Prezent was mostly focused on ecology. However, from 1932 on, many of the academic Marxist societies were shut down, after the proponents of \\"cultural revolution\\" fell out of favor with the regime. In 1934, Prezent had to leave university, and he moved to Odessa, where he worked with Trofim Lysenko at All-Union Institute of Selection and Genetics until 1938. The alliance with Lysenko proved extremely useful for both men, as Lysenko got a politically-savvy mentor in Prezent, while Prezent managed to return to political grace by associating himself with Lysenko and changing his views on biology and genetics in the process. From 1935 to 1941, Prezent was a deputy editor-in-chief of journal Yarovizaciya (Russian: –Ø—Ä–æ–≤–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏—è, meaning Vernalization). In 1939, he became Lysenko's consultant for philosophical issues at Lenin All-Union Academy of Agricultural Science (VASKhNIL) in Moscow, where he became a full member in 1948. From 1943 until 1951, Prezent held a chair of Darwinism and History of Biology at LGU, while for the final three years of that period (1948-1951) simultaneously being the dean of the Faculty of Biology of Moscow State University (MGU). In 1951, Prezent was made to leave both university positions due to concerns about his capacity to teach biology. He returned to VASKhNIL, where he stayed until the beginning of 1969, when he was dismissed due to his association with Lysenkoism. Attacks on ecology During the early 1930s, Prezent established himself as a critic of the leading Soviet ecologists of the time, and especially of the sub-field of biocenology as such. His attack on biocenologists had three directions: attack on the botanically-oriented ecologists, attack on then-most prominent Soviet educator in the field Boris Yevgenyevich Raikov, and finally attack on zoology-focused ecologists. Prezent's attack on plant ecologists occurred in February 1931. As a representative of Leningrad branch of Communist Academy, he had a role in the organization of the First All-Union Conference of Geobotanists and Floristics Experts. The conference was sponsored by the Botanical Institute, but Prezent nonetheless managed to overtake \\"methodological leadership\\" and put forward his agenda against biocenological botanists. Boris Raikov was Prezent's former colleague from Herzen Institute, and as of 1930 he was already under attacks from the organization of young naturalists. Prezent objected to Raikov's conservationist views. He considered conservationism a \\"wrecking theory\\", holding that it opposed the Stalinist views on progress, understood here as a triumph of working men and their technology. Proponents of conservationism, such as Raikov, were therefore considered by Prezent to be \\"agents of the world bourgeoisie\\". In 1932, one of the Prezent's anti-Raikov speeches, titled Class Struggle on the Natural Science Front was published in 20,000 copies, which marked the demise of conservationism in ecological education. Raikov and his associates were arrested or exiled. Raikov himself spent the World War II teaching in Arkhangelsk. The attack on zoologists started early, during the Fourth All- Union Congress of Zoologists, Anatomists, and Histologists in Kiev in May 1930, where Prezent first made his criticism of biocenology public in an exchange with the prominent zoologist Vladimir Vladimirovich Stanchinskiy. Similarly to the tactics he employed in fighting the botanists, Prezent waited until the December 1931 All-Union Faunistics Conference, and navigated its organization into silencing and attacking conservationsim. Prezent's cooperation with Lysenko Prezent first met Lysenko at the Congress of Geneticists and Breeders in 1929, but it was not until 1934 that they started closely cooperating in Lysenko's lab in Odessa. By that time, Lysenko was already following Michurin's version of Lamarckism, but he was not yet associating his work in the field of genetics with any political positions. However, after 1934, Prezent began introducing Lysenko to Marxist theory and party politics, which led to increasingly political tone of Lysenko's pronouncements, as well as to both Lysenko and Prezent denouncing Mendelian genetics. Prezent's influence on Lysenko was not limited to the philosophical and political aspects of the latter's work. Despite Prezent's lack of formal education in biology, he was one of Lysenko's main sources of information on Darwinism. Lysenko eventually produced a pseudo-scientific synthesis of Michurin's evolutionary biology, Prezent's philosophy of science, and Stalinist political theory that came to be known as Lysenkoism. Lysenko's teachings were based on his concept of \\"natural cooperation\\", as opposed to Darwin's idea of natural selection that he rejected. According to Lysenko, not only that the acquired characteristics of organisms were inheritable, but it was even possible for organisms of one species to transform into another species by acquiring appropriate characteristics over the course of their lives. The proponents of Lysenkoism advocated for the use of these \\"findings\\" in agriculture in order to increase yields, and alleviate the consequences of the Soviet famine of 1932-33. While many of Lysenko's views on agriculture, as well as his prominence, predated his cooperation with Prezent, it was only after 1934 that his debate with the mainstream geneticists became politicized. In that period, and with the full support of Stalin, many of the Soviet geneticists were purged or at least fired. In 1935 and 1936 Lysenko and Prezent brought the debates over genetics to the center of party politics. In those two years, the so-called \\"Academy Sessions\\" took place. It was a series of scientific debates chaired by Stalin himself, where Lysenko and Prezent counterposed their views to those of mainstream geneticists. The entire time, Prezent was extremely active in presenting Lysenko's works publicly as acts of genius. The full triumph came during a conference in 1948, when Lysenko announced genetics to be a bourgeois pseudoscience, and that the Central Committee supported such stance. After this, any serious engagement with non- Lysenkoist genetics became impossible in the Soviet union until 1964, especially at Lysenko-headed VASKhNIL, and Prezent-headed MGU Department of Darwinism. Death Isaak Prezent died of cancer on January 6, 1969 in Moscow. It was only several days after being dismissed from VASKhNIL. Awards In 1943, Prezent was awarded Order of the Red Banner of Labour.

During the Great Purge, Stepanov's colleague division commissar Peter Maximovich Feldman (standing to his left in the group photo behind Alexander Yegorov) was executed on August 22, 1938. On November 28, 1938, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union made the decision to dismiss Stepanov from the military, which was carried out the next day. He was arrested on December 9, 1938. He initially pleaded guilty to the charges he was accused of, but then withdrew his plea. He was convicted on May 31, 1939 and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment. He survived the Great Patriotic War, but did not participate in it. He died shortly after the end of the Soviet‚ÄìJapanese War of 1945 in a prison camp in Arkhangelsk Oblast.

Early life and World War I  Stepanov was born in August 1893 in the village of Novaya, Suzhdalsky Uyezd, Vladimir Governorate to a peasant family. He graduated from a two-year school in 1906 and worked as a knife sharpener before being drafted into the Imperial Russian Army in 1915 during World War I. Stepanov became an unter- ofitser upon graduation from a training command in the latter year. He fought as part of the 5th and 12th Armies of the Western Front. After the February Revolution Stepanov became chairman of the regimental committee of the 143rd Dorogobuzh Infantry Regiment, and in November became deputy secretary of the divisional committee. He was demobilized as a feldfebel in February 1918, subsequently working as secretary of a volost executive committee and as an organizer of the committee of the poor of the Zimin factory in Moscow Governorate.

Arrest and imprisonment  Stepanov was arrested on 9 December 1938, and sentenced to twenty years of imprisonment in the gulag on 31 May 1939, charged with participating in a military conspiracy. According to an account by historian Michael Parrish, on 30 March 1939, Stepanov wrote a letter to Kliment Voroshilov in which he told him that between 40 and 45 percent of chemical officers serving in military districts and 60 to 65 percent of those with corps and divisions had been arrested in the Great Purge. Voroshilov forwarded the letter to the Special Department, and Stepanov was arrested. While in the gulag, Stepanov repeatedly wrote requests to various institutions requesting review of his case, but was turned down each time. Both of his sons, Boris and Vladimir, fought in combat during World War II, and during the war Stepanov himself requested to be sent to the front, even as a private, but was again denied.

History William Henry Clark was born in Newry, Ireland, and arrived in SA in June 1839 aboard Sir Charles Forbes from Liverpool; the following year he married fellow-passenger Sarah Ann Blakely. He founded the Halifax Street brewery around 1844, and by May 1848 was described as an \\"enterprising brewer\\" when he founded a copper mine on land he owned near Strathalbyn. :Further examples of \\"enterprise\\" were his subdivision of land at North Adelaide and at Gilles Plains, his property on Hindley Street, and the office building he erected on King William Street between Currie and Waymouth streets, later owned by the Bank of Adelaide. :In 1854 he formed a partnership \\"W. H. Clark & Co.\\" with Spence, Parr and Logue, to purchase the Crawford brothers' Hindmarsh Brewery assets in an attempt to reduce competition and increase their client base. The brewery was unpopular with nearby residents due to the stench of the waste liquid discharged into the Gilles Street gutters. He built a mill and malthouse on the same side of Halifax Street, with just the Rob Roy Tavern between them. This was a time of economic recession: Clark sold the Halifax Street brewery to Henry Noltenius in February 1858, and continued to work as manager. In July Noltenius took on W. K. Simms as partner, then sold him his share of the business. Both Clark and Noltenius were in debt to the bank. Clark's house at Walkerville on the banks of the Torrens was advertised for sale in May 1858. Clark and Simms had around this time commenced on a second brewery, at the west end of Hindley Street, which would become the West End Brewery. Clark left South Australia for Melbourne around January 1860, a few months before his insolvency hearing and out of reach of his creditors, leaving W. K. Simms and G. P. Gardner to run the business. Clark died sometime between 1862 and 1873, but not mentioned in the newspapers of either colony. His death is not registered in South Australia. Nor has his date of birth been established, but it could be assumed he would have been between 20 and 30 years of age when he emigrated and married. ;Postscript Clark's Halifax Street brewery, after sixteen years laying idle, was revived by W. J. Disher in 1875 as the Imperial brewery, and by 1909 was the site of the Enterprise Boot Factory. The West End Brewery proved profitable and Simms and Chapman became wealthy men. They joined with Edwin Smith, who in 1876 built a large brewery complete with malting facilities at Kent Town, William Rounsevell and Alfred Simms, as the South Australian Brewing, Malting & Wine & Spirit Co. Ltd., enlarging the brewing facilities at West End, and centering the malting work at Kent Town. The company began a campaign of purchasing hotels freehold or leasehold, and by the end of the 1880s had a stranglehold on the Adelaide market. In 1893 they sold off their wine and spirit business, and the name was changed to South Australian Brewing Company, Limited.

A leading member of the Communist Party of Australia (CPA), Stevens reconciled feminism with her experience of class politics. Stevens was active and at the vanguard of the women's liberation movement in Sydney, \\"agitating, educating, and organizing, helping set up the services women needed, and then later mentoring other women and chronicling women's history through her written work\\".  Early life  Stevens was born Joyce Barnes on 6 January 1928 at Cullen Bullen, New South Wales near Lithgow, New South Wales, Australia. Her first home was a tin shed. Her mother had been a nurse, her father was a railway fettler, who moved from job to job. At age six, living near Casino, NSW Stevens recalled that they lived on the rabbits and foxes he trapped. During childhood she developed a strong sense of social justice, influenced by her mother Lucie Barnes. In 1942 the family moved to Sydney, where Stevens briefly attended North Sydney Girls High School. Her first job was as an articled clerk at a law firm. She was in the Land Army for a year. She later worked at the NSW Teachers Federation where she was influenced by communist women. Her active participation began when she joined the Eureka Youth League in 1942 and its parent body, the Communist Party of Australia in 1945. She became an organiser with the Eureka Youth League in 1948. Impressed by a 1955 CPA study group to China, Stevens returned home and led the CPA's Inner West activities ‚Äì social policy, education, health, and especially housing.  Work and activism  From the mid-1960s Stevens worked full-time for the CPA and became the CPA's National Women's Organiser. She worked as a journalist on the CPA newspaper Tribune: The People's Paper. Stevens was also secretary and general office administrator for Current Book Distributors 1963‚Äì1972. Stevens campaigned for improved living standards; supporting industrial activity; the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and environmental causes; opposing Nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific, Uranium mining in Australia, and the Vietnam War. After reading Simone de Beauvoir, she added feminism to her causes. In 1971 Stevens helped produce the first and subsequent issues of Mejane: A Women's Liberation Newspaper, published by the Mejane Collective; and Scarlet Woman, the first socialist-feminist magazine, published by the Sydney Scarlet Woman Collective in 1975. Stevens helped re- establish the annual International Women's Day March and in 1975 wrote Because We're Women for International Women's Year, which has since been translated into many languages. She played a significant role in establishing Women's Liberation House in Alberta Street, Sydney from where a contraception and abortion referral service was run. This led over time to a change in the law. Stevens helped organize dozens of successful conferences, commissions and seminars. These identified issues including domestic violence and the need for women's refuges. Elsie, the first women's refuge in Australia, was established by Stevens and a group of women in Glebe, Sydney in 1974. She also played a significant role in establishing Women's Liberation House in Alberta Street, Sydney, established the first two women's health centres in Sydney‚ÄìLeichhardt Women's Community Health Centre (LWCHC) in 1974 and Liverpool Women's Health Centre in 1975, and was instrumental in setting up the Control Abortion Referral Service. The Australian Council of Trade Unions adopted an amended version of her Working Women's Charter. Stevens helped found the Women's Employment Action Centre (WEAC) which campaigned for better wages and working conditions for women; especially for underprivileged women, and attempted to establish a comparable worth case between pay rates of traditional female and male occupations. She worked on its register of women in non-traditional jobs. Stevens became part of the CPA working to reconstruct its \\"socialist vision\\" by drawing on feminist, environmental, Aboriginal and multi-cultural inputs and aspirations. She supported the dissolution of the CPA in 1991. believing new forms of organization were required for the renewal of left politics.  Personal life  While working as an organizer with the Eureka Youth League in the late 1940s, she met her future husband, Jim Stevens. They married in 1949. Stevens separated from Jim in 1970, and began a 40-year lesbian relationship with Margo Moore. Stevens died on 6 May 2014.  Honours  In 1996, she was made a Member of the Order of Australia in the Australia Day Honours for her \\"service to social justice for women as an activist and writer\\". In 1988 she was recognised by the Sydney Public Tenants' Council for her commitment to public housing and as advocate for public housing tenants. In 2002 she was awarded the Women's Electoral Lobby's Edna Ryan Award for Mentoring.  Publications  = Author = * Stevens, J.

It has a rosette of fleshy leaves at the base of the plant and a single dark green and white flower. It grows in alpine and sub-alpine colonies. Description Pterostylis monticola is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a rosette of three to seven dark green, fleshy leaves surrounding the base of the flowering stem. Each leaf is egg-shaped to elliptic, 40‚Äì90 mm long and 15‚Äì25 mm wide. A single dark green and white flower 40‚Äì50 mm long and 17‚Äì22 mm wide is borne on a spike 200‚Äì400 mm high. The dorsal sepal and petals are fused, forming a hood or \\"galea\\" over the column. The dorsal sepal is the same length as the petals and curves forward with a pointed tip. There is a wide gap between the galea and the lateral sepals. The lateral sepals are erect and have thread-like tips 15‚Äì20 mm long and a bulging V-shaped sinus between them. The labellum is 16‚Äì20 mm long, about 4 mm wide, brown and curved and protrudes above the sinus. Flowering occurs from November to March. Taxonomy and naming Pterostylis monticola was first formally described in 1994 by David Jones and the description was published in Muelleria from a specimen collected in the Brindabella Range. The specific epithet (monticola) is said to derived from the Latin mons, meaning \\"mountain\\" and cola, meaning \\"dweller\\", referring to the montane habitat of this orchid. Cola can not be found in classical Latin as a single word, but is seen as part of compounds, such as Apenninicola, \\"a dweller among the Apennines\\" and terricola, \\"a dweller upon earth\\".Lewis, C.T. & Short, C. (1879). A Latin dictionary founded on Andrews' edition of Freund's Latin dictionary. Oxford: Clarendon Press.

The long stretch along the Bhagirathi has many swamps. The area between the Bhagirathi and the Jalangi, which flows through the middle of the subdivision, is known as Kalantar, a low-lying tract of black clay soil. A big part of the subdivision forms the Krishnanagar-Santipur Plain, which occupies the central part of the district. The Jalangi, after flowing through the middle of the subdivision, turns right and joins the Bhagirathi. On the south-east, the Churni separates the Krishnanagar-Santipur Plain from the Ranaghat-Chakdaha Plain. The east forms the boundary with Bangladesh.The subdivision is moderately urbanized. 20.795% of the population lives in urban areas and 79.205% lives in rural areas.

The statue was designed and crafted by Helen Boehm and E. M. Boehm Studios. History =Nixon and China= The swans were originally commissioned by Nixon in 1969 to join his oval office collection of works by the late Edward Marshall Boehm. Helen Boehm, Edward's widow and operator of his business posthumously, was the organizer of this collection for Nixon. One day, after presenting a selection of 18 porcelain birds for Nixon's choosing (intended as gifts to heads of state for his upcoming NATO tour), he expressed fatigue toward doves and hawks. Helen suggested finding a new bird to be an updated symbol of peace, one with less political baggage than say the dove, to which Nixon said \\"That's a fine idea.\\" Helen subsequently wrote to ornithologists around the world, seeking suggestions for what that new peace bird ought to be. Among the responses, and her own research, both gathered over several months, the mute swan was most mentioned, frequently having been cited for its tranquility, even over the traditional dove. Helen decades later would express that the mute swan captures \\"serenity and purity, [and is] a bird that had been associated with peace throughout history and in mythology. [...] The mute swan's range is worldwide; it came to the shores of America during the nineteenth century. Perhaps its most important characteristic is that it speaks with a soft voice.\\" Boehm and a team of 14 porcelain artists and craftsmen then worked for two years to produce the sculpture, using 10 tons of plaster to create the master molds. The sculpture featured a male and female mute swan, three infant swans, a natural setting of rocks and grass. Formed from roughly 60,000 sculpted lines, it weighed roughly 250 lbs, and stood over 42 inches high on a 3-foot base. The softness and detail in the feathers of the swans make it \\"hard to believe [they] are made of porcelain\\". Upon Boehm notifying the White House of the completion of the statue in 1971, she was asked to make one additional change: because Nixon had decided to present the swans to Mao Zedong as a gift during the U.S President's upcoming visit to China, that a plaque and presidential seal should be added to the statue. This request was fulfilled. During Nixon's visit the following year, he presented the swans to Premier Zhou Enlai in a gift-giving ceremony, and introduced the sculpture's artist (presumably Helen Boehm). =Original Copies= A total of two other copies were made before the molds were destroyed in 1974. The first copy was made for the White House Historical Society, finished in 1975. This copy was later loaned to a six-week exhibit in Russia, opened May 16, 1987 and organized by Helen Boehm, Raisa Gorbacheva, Vassili Zakharon (Russian Minister of Culture), and sponsored by Armand Hammer (longtime friend of Helen). During transit back to the U.S. and upon inspection, the statue was found permanently damaged, with one of the necks severed, and the feathers broken into hundreds of pieces. Helen described the situation as \\"The Peace Birds are in pieces. They're completely busted. I've been crying for two days.\\" The statue was one of half of 48 damaged in transit. The statue was packed by Boehm employees, shipped via Lufthansa and Finnair, arrived at JFK Airport, and was insured for an unknown amount. \\"One cannot place a value on them. They are priceless because they are not replaceable,\\" Helen remarked further. The second copy was later auctioned in 1976 for a wildlife benefit, selling for $150,000. The donor subsequently gifted the statue to the Vatican. At the time, this was the highest price paid for a porcelain sculpture.  Present Day  Today, the original statue of swans reside at the State Gifts exhibit in the National Museum of China, viewable behind glass box to museum visitors. The only other extant copy remains in the Vatican City.

He also said that the casualties included 103 army soldiers and unspecified numbers of civilians. The LNA launched air strikes on militant sites near the area in retaliation.  Accusation of war crimes  Human Rights Watch accused the 13th brigade, officially falling under the authority of Government of National Accord, and Benghazi Defense Brigades militia of summary executions of both civilians and soldiers. 75 bodies that were received by local hospitals showed sign of execution by shot in the head, including two 15 year old boys. Attackers were shouting slogans of You apostates, you enemies of God as they were executing captured soldiers according to one survivor who has been interviewed by HRW. Arab League decried the events as a \\"barbaric massacre\\". Egyptian ministry of foreign affairs declared the event as a terrorist attack. Envoys from China, France, Russia, United Kingdom and United States of America issued a joint statement in which they described summary executions of both military personnel and civilians.  Response  GNA Minister of Defense Al-Mahdi Al-Barghathi has been suspended by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj following allegations of his involvement in attack. Barghathi denied involvement, stating that ministry never ordered attack. On 20th May, after gathering of tribal elders in city of Sebha, southern tribes gave Misrata 13th battalion (former 3rd Force) 72 hours to vacate their main base at Sabha Air Base, threatening to destroy Misrata forces inside otherwise. Tribal elders declared all agreements with Misrata forces void and held them fully responsible for massacre at Brak al-Shati. Libyan National Army in following days heavily bombarded Benghazi Defense Brigades bases in Jufra District and at Al Jufra Air Base where both 13th Misrata battalion and Benghazi Defense Brigades are based as part of their new \\"Martyrs of Brak al-Shati operation\\".

According to the governmental philosophy that Korea's future depends on talent development and no student should quit studying due to financial reasons, they help students grow into talents that serve the nation and society as members of Korea. Through the management of Korea's national scholarship programs, student loan programs, and talent development programs, KOSAF offers customized student aid services and student loan program is one of their major tasks.:ko:ÌïúÍµ≠Ïû•ÌïôÏû¨Îã® Main Loan Programs =Income Contingent Loan= For undergraduate students of all grades from low-income households in the 1st through 7th income bracket levels; also, for students (irrespective of income level) from households with three or more children‚Äîbeginning with the third child. Strong academic performance is part of the eligibility criteria. Loans are not subject to credit approval. Loan applicants must be enrolled for undergraduate study in a postsecondary institution in Korea. Students do not qualify for this loan program if they are in a graduate school, a continuing education program through an academic credit bank system, or a school outside of Korea.

Loan payments may not exceed the student's financial need; there is no other upper limit on the amount borrowed (loan program permits full coverage of tuition and expenses). In the case of applying loan towards both tuition/school fees and in-study living expenses, the lower limit is KRW 600,000 (at least KRW 100,000 for tuition/school fees plus at least KRW 500,000 for living expenses). Under the income contingent repayment system, a borrower does not have to pay the loan principal amount or interest until he or she has income above a certain minimum threshold level for repayment. Once the borrower's annual income is greater than the repayment minimum threshold level, the borrower is under obligation to begin repayment. =Direct Loan (DL)= Reduced-interest loans that come from and are guaranteed by the government. Qualifying borrowers, on certain conditions, may be eligible for interest relief offered by the government. For undergraduate and graduate students of any grade level*, from households of any income level. Loan applicants must be enrolled for undergraduate study in a postsecondary institution in Korea.

The repayment system offers a borrower grace period of 10 years or less during which payments only need to be made towards the interest on the loan. This maximum period of time is determined by the borrower's year in school and the remaining number of years within the standard period of the borrower's program. After the grace period, the borrower is given up to 10 years in which to repay the loan principal amount and interest.

Loan must be used for necessary non-tuition, living expenses during the academic year that may include room and board, books and supplies, and transportation costs. The student may determine the amount to borrow in increments of KRW 100,000‚Äîfrom KRW 500,000 to KRW 1 million per semester (or up to KRW 2 million per school year). May receive loan on its own or in combination with a student loan (for school tuition and fees). =KOSAF Loan Conversion Program= For undergraduate and graduate students whose academic and income levels qualify them for the Income Contingent Loan (ICL). Students receiving the Direct Loan (DL) who qualify for the ICL may be eligible to shift from the DL to the ICL. The transition only applies from the school semester during which the loan approval is made. For all previous semesters during which the borrower received the DL, the terms and conditions of the DL fully apply (e.g. the interest accrued on the loan principal each month while the borrower was receiving the DL must be repaid). Current situation About 750,000 students borrowed about 2.7 trillion KRW in 2011. KOSAF seeks lower interest rates by issuing direct loans. Since KOSAF issue government-guaranteed bonds, students can borrow directly from the foundation, which reduces their burden on tuition payment. Only three out of 10 college graduates who applied for the Deun Deun Student Loan manage to earn enough money to pay back the government according to the Korean Student Aid Foundation (KOSAF).

Reception  The Allmusic review noted \\"This is an odd record. ... The pianist/composer Lennie Tristano, with whom Marsh had a long relationship, evidently decided the only valuable moments from the sessions were these solos, so he simply excised everything else and presented them as self-contained pieces. For the general listener, this, of course, creates some problems. No themes are heard (though many of the pieces are standards), so the basis for the improvisation can often only be guessed at, and, obviously, any sense of wholeness is by the boards. On the other hand, Marsh's tenor playing is supple, silvery, and generally luscious ... So while the normal jazz listening experience is necessarily lacking, those who want a chance to hear Marsh in isolation (including, presumably, students of the saxophone) might find this release to be a valuable document\\".

The castle stands in the center of town and houses the current Archivo General de Simancas.  History  The site of the castle was at one time a Moorish fortress. In the 15th century the House of Enr√≠quez constructed a new fortification on top of the existing ruins, restored the Moorish walls, and added a chapel. The new castle was seized by the Spanish Crown during the reign of the Catholic Monarchs and turned into a prison. In 1540 the Archivo General de Simancas was established in the castle, the first official archive of Castile. Felipe II transformed the castle into General Archive of the Kingdom, which housed one of the most important archives in Europe with 35 million documents. The castle was put under the protection of the Spanish government in 1949. In 1952 renovations were enacted to reduce risk to the archives.GONZ√ÅLEZ AMEZ√öA, Agust√≠n, \\"The General Archive of Simancas and the history of Spain\\" , in National Education Magazine n¬∫ 54 , 1945, pp. 11-30Francisco Rodr√≠guez Mar√≠n, ed.

Fortification and structure  The castle's foundation, walls, battlements, gates, and bridges all date back to the late 15th century, mostly attributed from 1467 to 1480. The end of the Reconquista in 1492 ended the immediate need for a large defensive fortification, and as such the castle's various reconstructions moulded it into an administrative building. Later additions to the castle incorporate aspects of the Herrerian style of architecture. The current archive housed within the castle has been protected with fireproofing measures, and the 15th-century chapel built by the Enr√≠quez has been restored.

Before his superannuation from regular service, he held various positions at TIFR such as that of an associate professor (1991) and professor grades from G to J (1995‚Äì2008). In between, he had a one-year sabbatical at the University of Paris as a visiting scientist during 1984‚Äì85) and a month-long stint at Isaac Newton Institute in May 2006 as a Rothschild Professor. Post-retirement, he continues his association with TIFR as a distinguished professor of the institution. He also serves as a distinguished visiting faculty at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune. Dhar is married to Manju and the couple has two children. The family lives in TIFR Housing Colony along Homi Bhabha Road in Mumbai.  Legacy  Wiener or Brownian motion process (a continuous-time stochastic process) on the surface of a sphere Focusing his studies on statistical physics and stochastic processes, Dhar has worked on the statistical mechanics and kinetics of random lattices and his work is reported to have widened our understanding of the disciplines. He is credited with the introduction of spectral dimension concept in the studies of fractals and contributed to developing a methodology for determining their critical phenomena using real-space renormalization group techniques which was the first time the mathematical apparatus was used for calculations on nontrivial critical exponents on fractals. He worked with Ramakrishna Ramaswamy to solve the Abelian sandpile model of self-organized criticality and developed a new model which came to be known as Dhar-Ramaswamy model. Working on directed-site animals-enumeration problem using Bethe ansatz method, he proposed the evolution operator which has since been subjected to studies by other researchers as Dhar directed-site animals-enumeration problem. He also demonstrated the predominance of slow flipping of isolated unfrustrated clusters in auto-correlation functions and proposed models of metastable glassy states in stochastic evolution. His studies have been documented by way of a number of articles and the online article repository of Indian Academy of Sciences has listed 113 of them. Dhar is an associate editor of Journal of Statistical Physics, a Springer publication since 2005 where he sat in the editorial board on two previous terms (1993‚Äì96 and 1999‚Äì2002). He is an editorial board member of the Indian Journal of Pure and Applied Physics (IJPAP) of the National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR), a former editorial adviser to Physica A, an Elsevier science journal, and has been associated with journals such as Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment, Physical Review E and Pramana as an editorial board member. He was a member of the Commission on Statistical Physics of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics from 1992 to 1995 and is a member of the program committee of the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences. He has also delivered invited speeches and the special lecture on The Curious Relationship Between Physics and Mathematics at the University of Mumbai on 19 October 2016 was one among them.  Awards and honors  During his doctoral days at Caltech, Dhar held two institutional fellowships; E. P. Anthony fellowship (1972‚Äì73) and R. P. Feynman fellowship (1974‚Äì76). He received the Young Scientist Medal of the Indian National Science Academy in 1983. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, one of the highest Indian science awards in 1991. Two year's later, International Centre for Theoretical Physics selected him for the 1993 J. Robert Schrieffer Prize. INSA honored him again in 2001 with the Satyendranath Bose Medal and he received the TWAS Prize of The World Academy of Sciences in 2002. He is also a recipient of the distinguished alumni award of the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. Dhar was elected as a fellow by the Indian Academy of Sciences in 1990 where he is a sitting council member. He became an elected fellow of the Indian National Science Academy on 1995 and the National Academy of Sciences, India elected him as a fellow in 1999. He received the elected fellowship of the World Academy of Sciences in 2006 and was selected for the J. C. Bose National fellowship of the Science and Engineering Research Board in 2007, with the tenure running until 2017.

He then successively commanded (Jan 1806 ‚Äì Jan 1808, mostly in the Channel), (1808‚Äì1810) on the Irish station and then (1810‚Äì1812) In these ships he served in the West Indies, Bay of Biscay, Ireland, around Madeira and the Azores. On 19 March 1809 Druid captured the schooner Belle Hortense; on 25 June the French private ship of war Jenny and her cargo; on 13 November 1809 Basque, French national brig (later ). On Endymion in November 1810, he captured the French privateer Milan of St. Malo, with 14 guns and 80 men.

Life after the navy Sir William and Dame Catherine had 5 children, of whom only 3 daughters survived to adulthood ‚Äì Emma Horatia (probably named after Emma Hamilton and her daughter Horatia Nelson), Mary Anne and Ellen Catherine (who married Dr Horatio Girdlestone, grandson of Susannah Nelson). After retirement, Sir William resumed his passion for the classics, completely mastering Greek and finding amusement and pleasure in reading Greek and Roman writers, historians, satirists and poets. He also learnt German, Spanish and Italian. He died at the age of 53 on 16 Dec 1830 at Costessey, and is buried at St Edmund's, with his parents buried there later. Some time later, after the death of Catherine and later her twin sister Jemima (aka Susanna), a memorial window was created in the church of St Mary's at Burnham Westgate, honouring them all.

He was the founder of the Institute for the Deaf as well as two religious orders dedicated to the care of deaf-mute children. Provolo was a noted musician and singer and put these skills to tremendous use during his life while also resorting to his own form of miming and sign language to better interact and educate with deaf and mute children to whom he dedicated his work. His school's work suffered after his death since those who followed him did not possess his charisma nor his miming skills, though the work of his orders spread across the globe. His school is now mired in sexual abuse allegations which continue at present. Provolo's cause for sainthood commenced in 1960 under Pope John XXIII and he became titled as a Servant of God; confirmation of his heroic virtue allowed for Pope Francis to name him as Venerable on February 27, 2017. Life Antonio Provolo was born in Verona in 1801 to the poor landowners Stefano Provolo and Antonia Allegri. His father died in 1816. He studied under the Carmelites and soon began his studies at the Saint Sebastian school. He might have even wanted to have become a Carmelite friar had it not been for the Napoleonic suppression of religious orders. It was around this time that he first met Father Giovanni Frisoni who became his spiritual director and advised Provolo to begin his ecclesial studies. Provolo collaborated with Saint Giovanni Antonio Farina since both men were dedicated towards the field of education. Provolo was ordained to the priesthood on 18 December 1824 and celebrated his first Mass sometime that same month. He taught seminarians after his ordination (he taught grammar) in Verona but would enter active parish service as a pastor sometime in 1825. He opened a school for the deaf ‚Äì the Institute for the Deaf ‚Äì on 30 October 1830 and founded two religious orders in 1840 and 1842 (an all-female order) dedicated to his work of working alongside deaf-mute children. Saint Maddalena di Canossa aided him in setting up his school and he collaborated with her from 1825 to 1830. He was a gifted musician and singer and people described his voice as being \\"divine\\". His music teachers were disappointed that he did not choose singing as a career since his teachers believed he had remarkable potential for a remarkable career. As a novice, he directed a choir. Provolo studied under Father Sicard in Paris for nine months and began to teach deaf- mute children using French mime gestures and soon developed his own oral methods. Provolo died on 4 November 1842 in Verona due to a dangerous edema; his remains since 1930 have been in the church of Santa Maria del Pianto. His institute suffered after his death because his successors lacked his charisma and his unique linguistic and miming abilities, though his institute did spread to other parts of the world. His institute is at present mired in several sexual abuse allegations. Beatification process The cause for beatification commenced in 1960 under Pope John XXIII and Provolo became titled as a Servant of God; the informative process was launched in Verona to collect documentation and these were sent to the Congregation for Rites for further investigation. But the cause remained inactive until 6 June 1997 when the Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated this informative phase in Rome. The postulation submitted the Positio to the C.C.S. in 2000 with historians approving the cause not long after on 30 May 2000. Theologians approved the cause on 21 May 2010 as did the C.C.S. later on 2 February 2017. Provolo was named as Venerable on 27 February 2017 after Pope Francis confirmed that the late priest lived a life of heroic virtue. The process for a miracle opened in the diocese of its origin on 16 May 2007 and concluded sometime later prior to the C.C.S. validating this process on 30 January 2009. The current postulator for this cause is the Piarist priest Mateusz Pindelski.

Many of its buildings are either registered on Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship heritage list, or part of Bydgoszcz local history. On its centre stands a statue of Leon Barciszewski, ancient mayor of Bydgoszcz (1932-1939).  Location  The triangular square is located in the southern part of Bydgoszcz Old Town. It links the western tip of D≈Çuga street to Pozna≈Ñska street, a busy thoroughfare. Houses on the northern frontage have also a view onto Mill Island. The square on a 16th- century map History The area ties in the square outside the walls of the city, just beyond the Pozna≈Ñ Gate, located at today's western tip of D≈Çuga street. Such gate stood from 14th to first half of 19th century, built several times with various materials (brick, wood). Because of the bottle neck it was creating in D≈Çuga street, the Poznan Gate was demolished in 1828, and last rubbles evacuated in 1835. During the entire 18th century, one of the first city brick factory had been operating up in the area, run by Albert Bohon from Gda≈Ñsk. From 1838 onwards, the triangular square at the junction of D≈Çuga, Pozna≈Ñska, and Podg√≥rna streets was the venue for trading firewood and wool collected from the surrounding farms which ran sheep breedings at the initiative of the \\"Economic Society for Kujawy\\" . With import of overseas cotton, sheep breeding gradually declined, and wool trading disappeared: its traditions remained in the name of the square, officialized in 1854. When the tram network developed, the first line (1888-1896) ran through We≈Çniany Rynek along Pozna≈Ñska street to Church of the Holy Trinity on Swiƒôtej Trojcy street, then further to Grunwaldska street narrow-gauge train station. On the square, a horse station was standing, run by a boy with spare harnessed horses sheltered inside huts. Tram network was electrified in 1896, and the tram line through Wool Market was finally liquidated in 1970. On the corner with Podg√≥rna Street used to stand a hotel, initially named Hotel Moritz, where Prince Augustus of Prussia died on July 19, 1843, while performing an inspection visit. The hotel name was later changed to French Hotel and Hotel Pomeranian, before being liquidated in 1934. From 1960 to 2008, the square has been used as a city parking lot. An overhaul of the area with renovation of the pavement has been carried out in 2008, highlighting its architecture and the statue of pre-war president of Bydgoszcz, Leon Barciszewski. =Naming= Through history, the street bore the following names: * 1854‚Äì1920, Wollmarkt; * 1920‚Äì1939, We≈Çniany Rynek; * 1939‚Äì1945, Wollmarkt; * Since 1945, We≈Çniany Rynek. The name refers to the area where wool used to be traded from the surroundings in the middle of the 19th century.

Program Opieki nad Zabytkami miasta Bydgoszczy na lata 2013-2016 Eclecticism The tenement built in the first half of the 18th century was initially addressed at Wollmarkt 8. It had for first landlord August Arnholt, a wood merchant. Subsequent renovations in the 20th century changed its shape (addition of a second storey) and wiped away the facade decoration. Wilhelm Kopp's Tenement at No.2 1896‚Äì1897, by J√≥zef ≈öwiƒôcicki Neo-Baroque The building has been realized by famous Bydgoszcz architect of the 19th century J√≥zef ≈öwiƒôcicki, who designed more than 60 projects in the 1890s in the city. The commissioner of the tenement at then Wollmarkt 9 was Wilhelm Kopp, an entrepreneur and owner of a thriving dye house at nearby Swiƒôtej Trojcy street 4/6. One of his sons, Julius, lived in this building till World War II. Today, the ground floor houses a night club, Stara Babcia. Truthful to his art, J√≥zef ≈öwiƒôcicki reproduced here the Neo-Baroque features he was fond of, as in other famous realisations across downtown (e.g. Hotel \\"Pod Orlem\\", Plac Wolno≈õci 1, Theatre square 2). The facade is covered with architectural details and motifs: bossage, bay windows, balustrades, columns, pilasters, pediments bearing ornamented tympanums, coat of arms and finials on the roof.

Still leading his hatmaking as a rentier, he moved in the 1910s to Danziger stra√üe 147, now Gda≈Ñska Street 42. Today, the tenement houses a furniture shop, Bodzio. The architecture of this house, with simple elements and gable, reflects other contemporary buildings from the 1850s that one can find in downtown Bydgoszcz (Focha street 6, Gda≈Ñska 40).

In this house lived Augustyn and Roman Tr√§ger, who played an important role during the Second World War in obtaining intelligence on the German V-1 and V-2 missiles tested in Pennem√ºnde, on the island of Usedom (Pomerania). A plaque commemorating those heroes has been unveiled on the wall of the house in 2003. The edifice lost its beautiful eclectic features, in particular two large wrought iron balconies that used to overhang the main entrance, and a grand Neo-Baroque pediment with urns which crowned the facade.

At the turn of the 20th century, Wilhelm Wei√ü, a merchant, took over the ownership of the tenement, which he kept till the outbreak of the Second World War. Since the beginning of 2017, the ground floor hosts a virtual gaming salon, Cyber Machina. The tenement still retains nice architectural details.

After the end of World War II, communist authorities opposed any intent to celebrate the memory of the pre-war mayor, declining even the naming of a street despite long-term efforts. A committee for the construction of a monument to Leon Barciszewski was established on January 14, 1981, at the initiative of Solidarno≈õƒá Union. Its members were engineers Zbigniew Wo≈∫niak, Aleksander Kaszowski, Irena Horbulewicz and J√≥zef Podg√≥reczny, Henryk Kulpi≈Ñski, J√≥zef Werno, Anna Dro≈ºniakiewicz, Andrzej Kowalski, Gra≈ºyna Kasprzak, Marek Guczalski, Olaf Bitte. It was planned to set up the monument on Theatre square. In 1981, social contributions began to be collected. With the introduction of martial law in July 1981, the initiative was paused and only resumed in the second half of the 1980s. Eventually, total funds were gathered with the help of city residents, the Ministry of Culture and Art and the City Hall. Sculptor S≈Çawoj Ostrowski designed the statue, and bronze casting was performed for a symbolic remuneration by a team from the Gdynia Navy Shipyard under the supervision of engineer Bandrowski. The unveiling of the monument took place on November 11, 1989, Polish National Independence Day and concurrently the 50th anniversary of Leon Barciszewski's murder. It then stood on the square between the Brda river and Grodzka Street No.1: the ceremony was chaired by Bydgoszcz mayor, W≈Çadys≈Çaw Przybylski, and Leon Barciszewski's daughter, Danuta Barciszewska- Borkowska, after a solemn service at the cathedral led by Bishop Jan Wiktor Nowak. In 2007, Bydgoszcz municipality moved the monument to the newly renovated Wool Market square.

M. Chaitanya. It features Sharmiela Mandre and Chiranjeevi Sarja in the lead. Achyuth Kumar and Prakash Belawadi play the supporting roles.Screenplay was written by Sunanda and Carl Austin. The project marks the Bollywood production and distribution company Eros International's entry into Kannada cinema. The film is produced by Nakshatra Productions, United Kingdom for KS films.The original score and soundtrack for the film was composed by Gurukiran in London.

The movie is an official remake of the 2015 Tamil movie Maya. It is the second collaboration of executive producer Yogish Dwarakish -director Chaitanya- hero Chiranjeevi trio after Aatagara. The movie marked the entry of Eros International in Kannada film industry. This was also the last Kannada movie to be released before the implementation of GST.  Plot  The film runs on two seemingly separate plots simultaneously. In one, a single mother in Bengaluru is trying to make a living out of her floundering acting career. In the second, an artist is in London assigned to draw illustrations for a book about a ghost that haunts a locked out mental asylum. It is only towards the end that the two plots merge and the audience gets to understand the suspense and the missing blocks. The film thoroughly enjoyable. Cast * Sharmiela Mandre as Sharmila * Chiranjeevi Sarja as Arjun/Shiva * Achyuth Kumar as Madan * Prakash Belawadi as PK * Sneha Acharya as Swathi * Balaji Manohar Reception The movie received positive reviews from all quarters. The Times of India gave the movie 3.5 stars and praised its script saying \\"The biggest victory for Aake is the script, which lingers on in one's mind, in which you try to join the dots even much after the film's ended. Deccan Chronicle gave the movie 3 stars. Praising its technical brilliance , it said \\"Aake has an imaginary and suspense elements to builds the tension till her real face is revealed. It is the making and the technical work capturing the London's nearby creepy forest area in the dark which makes it an interesting watch\\". Filmetriks said it was better than its original Maya.http://filmetriks.com/movie-reviews/aake-movie-review-rating-3-5-stars- better-maya2015/2550/ The newsminute too spoke high of the movie ‚Äì \\"What works for Aake is that the fundamentals are all done right. So, the camera stays close-in and tightly focused, keeping an almost claustrophobic view on the film‚Äôs protagonists and antagonists. This helps ratchet the tension higher, as you‚Äôre constantly wondering what‚Äôs lingering just outside the frame.The film‚Äôs soundscape is also sharply focused for the most part, staying away from the kind of cacophonous excess that turns many horror films into unintentional comedies.\\". Soundtrack The film's score and soundtrack were composed by Gurukiran. The Background Score was much appreciated.

However, the elections can be held earlier under exceptional circumstances, such as the deposition, resignation or death of the President. It will be the thirteenth presidential election in Iran. Electoral system The President of Iran is the country's highest directly elected official, the chief of the executive branch, and the second most important position after the Supreme Leader. Duties are similar to heads of governments in other countries, except that the armed forces, Chief judiciary system, state television, and other key governmental organizations are under the control of the Supreme Leader of Iran. It is also an informal custom that cabinet ministers for sensitive departments like foreign relations and intelligence are coordinated with the Supreme Leader. Any Iranian citizen born in Iran, believing in God and the official religion of Iran (Islam), who has always been loyal to the Constitution and is above 21 years of age may register as a presidential candidate. An institution called the Election Monitoring Agency (EMA) and managed by the Guardian Council vets registered candidates and selects a handful to run in the election. The Guardian Council does not announce publicly the reason for rejections of particular candidates although those reasons are explained to each candidate. Women who register as candidates have invariably been excluded from standing for election by the Council. Possible candidates The incumbent president, Hassan Rouhani, is not eligible to run for office in the upcoming elections.

The 59-meter bell tower of the church with its spire is a distinctive feature of the skyline of the city. = Rose window = In line with the characteristic of Gothic architecture, a large rose window is present on the church facade above the main entrance. The beautiful glass-work designed by the artist Lennart Rafael Segerstr√•le (1892‚Äì1975) is titled \\"Praise to Creation\\" (in Swedish Sk√•pelsens lovs√•ng). In it the spiritual praise to God's creation is epitomized by the figure of David playing the harp surrounded by floral and vegetable motifs. A circular staircase accessible from the porch's right side leads to the upper loggia inside the church, from which it is possible to admire at a closer distance the intricate design of the glazed window. = The gallery's fresco = Upon entering the church, passing the vestibule (vapenrum), and looking up to the ceiling of the gallery, it is possible to admire the fresco painted by Carl August Henry Ericsson (1898‚Äì1933). The work symbolizes the tree of spiritual life whose branches extend all over the world. Around the central figure of the angel, twelve doves are seen flying spreading their wings, crowned by glorious (halos). They represent the twelve apostles with the divine message of salvation for the whole world. = Pipe organ = Located on the upper loggia overlooking the nave, the pipe organ has 15 stops. The instrument was manufactured in the city of Kangasala by the Kangasala Urkutehdas and designed by the Finnish organist Asko Rautioaho who designed the instrument in such a way that the stained glass window of the fa√ßade located behind the organ itself emerges from the profile of the musical instrument and is also visible from the inside of the church.

History Australian cuisine is derived from the tastes of immigrant settlers to Australia and the produce they have introduced to the continent, combined with the produce indigenous to Australia. The British colonial period established a strong base of interest in Anglo-Celtic style recipes and methods. After World War II, subsequent waves of multicultural immigration, with a majority drawn from Asia and the Mediterranean region, and the strong, sophisticated food cultures these ethnic communities have brought with them influenced the development of Australian cuisine. Arguably the first Modern Australian restaurant was Sydney's Bayswater Brasserie (est. 1982), which offered Mediterranean dishes with Asian and Middle Eastern influences and \\"showed Sydney [...] that food can be adventurous without being expensive\\". The term itself was first used in print in the 1993 edition of the Sydney Morning Herald Good Food Guide, which placed 34 restaurants under this heading, and was quickly adopted to describe the burgeoning food scene in Sydney in the 1990s. Leading exponents of the style include Tetsuya Wakuda , Neil Perry and Peter Gilmore. As of 2014, the term is considered somewhat dated, with many restaurants preferring to call their style \\"contemporary Australian cuisine\\" instead.
