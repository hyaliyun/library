Containing social themes, this type of art finds expression in a variety of forms. The most common languages used are English and Arabic. Like all other forms of art, graffiti can serve as a medium for instigating political or social change, or as a form of self-expression. Socio- political Sticker art Sticker art refers to the practice of posting images or phrases to convey a message.An example of Islamic sticker art in Mali A collaborative project called \\"INSIDE OUT: Artocracy in Tunisia\\" uses sticker art to promote the spirit of democracy in post-revolutionary Tunisia. Prior to the revolution, only presidential photography could be found in the public space. A group of six photographers, along with a French graffiti artist called JR, replaced these pictures with black and white photographs of anonymous Tunisian people. Their goal is to inspire the people of Tunisia to see themselves in a new light. One of the photographers states: \\"If people want to tear them down, or write something on them, that's part of the project, that's okay.\\" Subvertising Subvertising refers to the practice of making spoofs or parodies of political advertisements. Princess Hijab, an anonymous street artist from Paris, paints Muslim veils on advertisements in the subway. She refers to this as \\"hijabisation.\\" Since the enforcement of the \\"burqa ban,\\" in which women are prohibited from wearing the burqa in public places, her art has sparked feminist and fundamentalist questions. It is not known if Princess Hijab is a Muslim or even a woman. \\"The real identity behind Princess Hijab is of no importance,\\" she has been quoted. Inspired by Naomi Klein's No Logo, she drew her first veil in 2006 on the French rapper Diam's, who subsequently happened to convert to Islam and now wears a veil. Graffiti on the subways in Paris is considered vandalism. Consequently, Princess Hijab has become highly selective and only paints four to five advertisements a year. She chooses to combine veils with advertisements because they are both \\"dogmas that can be questioned.\\" Spray paint Mural in Cairo reads \\"I am Muslim and I love my Christian siblings.\\" Graffiti as a form of communication in Palestine began in 1987 during the first Intifada. This was a period in which there were no Palestinian TV or Radio stations in the Gaza Strip. Murals commemorated martyrs as well as called protestors to action. Israeli military would force Palestinians to wash off graffiti from their homes. The Dome of the Rock was common among murals in Palestine. In 2006, Hamas took over the graffiti scene. Hamas would encourage people to perform the first of the day‚Äôs five prayers through street art.Gr√∂ndahl, Mia. Gaza Graffiti: Messages of Love and Politics. Cairo: American University in Cairo, 2009. Print. Currently, The West Bank wall is covered in graffiti. Numerous messages can be found including marriage proposals, notes to friends, and jokes. Also common are messages of peace. One reads: \\"Mirror, mirror on the wall. When will this senseless object fall?\\" \\"Trying to imagine a clear view between Palestine and Israel,\\" is another. Messages such as these splatter across the wall, and some graffiti artists will paint your message for a fee. Notable graffiti artists Middle East See also: Graffiti in Iran. From Lebanon, Yazan Halwani has developed his form of graffiti based on Arabic calligraphy, figures and culture. His style mixes portraiture and Arabic calligraphy on large walls in Beirut. Halwani thinks that graffiti in the Arab world and Beirut should not evolve into a form of vandalism and therefore he says that his murals try to adapt to their environment and not against it.Alabaster, Olivia. \\"I like to write Beirut as it‚Äôs the city that gave us everything\\", The Daily Star, Beirut, 09 February 2013. Retrieved on 13 September 2014. From Tehran, a graffiti artist by the name \\"A1one (a.k.a. Tanha)\\" has been credited with starting the modern street art movement in Tehran and Middle East. He started his career as an artist in the late 1990s with indoor painting. Now he is an international artist, known for his innovative Arabic and Persian calligraphic street art painted in various countries. A wall spraypainted by \\"A1one\\" in Tehran In 2003, he moved outdoors by spraying a 30x40cm stencil on university walls to express to the \\"uncommon pressure\\" at the university which was \\"endured in silence.\\" However, the motivations behind his art are not protest. He states that his art is simply personal expression: \\"A drawing on the street is similar to a letter: It proves that there is a writer.\\" In the Arab World, three major areas of interest can be identified: Lebanon, the Palestinian Territories and the Arab states that were involved in the Arab Spring. In these areas, graffiti has been perceived, both by the public and the media, as a barometer of the society. Lebanon‚Äôs religious and ethnic diversity and its position at the crossroad of the Mediterranean basin and the Arab World have contributed to the appearance and development of an active youth culture and graffiti is part of it. Secondly, the Palestinian Territories are a space where graffiti is one of the most powerful forms of protest against what its inhabitants perceive as a contemporary form of colonization. Last but not least, the social importance of graffiti and its militant functions have recently been reflected by the international media, within the coverage of the uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Syria. The media coverage of the Arab Spring has drawn attention to a type of both artistic and political expression typical for the young people in the MENA region. Europe After growing up in Paris during the late 80s and early 90s, graffiti artist eL Seed found himself inspired by hip-hop culture. With parents from Temoula, Tunisia, he explored his North African origins by learning calligraphy. Before becoming an artist, he pursued degrees in marketing and business. After befriending a graffiti artist known as Hest1, he began to combine his love of graffiti and calligraphy. Today, he creates both personal exhibitions as well as murals for commission. Also combining calligraphy with graffiti, Niels Meulman (also known as SHOE) coined the phrase \\"calligraffiti.\\" Born in Amsterdam, SHOE has worked for ad agencies such as BBDO and the television channel MTV.

Types of machine Batch coding machines are categorized in the following two categories: * Contact coding type * Non contact coding type These coding machines are further sub categorized into the following types depending on their mode of operation: * Automatic Once set, works automatically with the operator only having to look after its working and settings. Feeding, printing, collecting operation are done automatically, however these features vary in the different makes of machines. * Semi- automatic The machine works on its own but the feeding and collecting has to be done by hand. * Hand operated or manual Feeding as well as the machine are operated manually. They are suitable for smal l production and are highly portable. * Online These machine works automatically online with other machines or they can be of continuous type with feeding from other machine, by hand or other feeding mechanisms, but are integrated or attached in line with other online machines. Contact coding type These machines print or mark on products by contacting the product surface. They mostly use some letters made up of metal or rubber and ink media like liquid ink or a ribbon or solid ink etc. to make an impression. The letters are made offset, so while printing they give mirror image and straight print is obtained. Non contact coding type These machine do not comes in contact in any way while printing or marking on products. Normally these machine uses beams/spray to mark. These beams may be emanating from laser, or the spray of ink, the most important factor is that the product or machine should be moving at constant speed. The moving product are sensed by a sensor & give a signal to the machine which responds immediately with the printing. These machine also work as online machines. A few machines in this category are Inkjet printer, Laser printer, industrial Inkjet coding machine, laser marking systems.

It was built by the Belmont Shire Council and opened in 1912. Services were suspended several times and the line formally closed in October 1926. History Portion of a 1915 map showing the Belmont Tramway The Tramways Act of 1882 gave local councils in Queensland powers to build railways which did not compete with the Queensland Railways. For legal reasons they were considered to be tramways. The construction was proposed in 1909 and the Belmont Shire Council requested an engineering report on the cost of a tramway. The Shire constructed a tramway long from a junction on the Cleveland railway line between Norman Park and Morningside. There were passenger shelters at Belmont Junction, Seven Hills, Mount Bruce, City View, Mayfield Road, Carina and stations with goods facilities at Springfield and the terminus at Belmont. The cost of construction was ¬£20,000.C.C. Singleton, The Belmont Shire Council's Railway, Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin No.258, April 1959 The line was originally operated by Queensland Railways until the Shire acquired its own steam tram (Baldwin b/n 35935 of 1911) and three carriages. The maximum speed was with a limit of over the bridges. It was expensive to operate and services were suspended in 1915, at which time the Shire's tram and carriages were sold. The line was reopened due to local agitation and was operated by Queensland Railways on behalf of the Shire until 16 April 1924, when services were again suspended due to the condition of the bridges. The locomotives permitted to work the line were the A12, A14, B13, B15 and PB15 class. The line reopened again in April 1925 but the Brisbane City Council, which had absorbed the Shire, was not interested in running the tramway at a loss and it finally closed in October 1926. 664 metres of the track bed along Old Cleveland Road became part of the Brisbane City Council electric tram route 06 (Valley ‚Äì Belmont) in 1948.

As a player, Berntsen is most notable for his time at Lillestr√∏m and V√•lerenga in Tippeligaen and the Austrian club Bregenz. After his retirement he has been head coach of L√∏renskog, Kongsvinger and Str√∏mmen.  Player career  He was born in Oslo, and started his career in Str√∏mmen before he moved to Lillestr√∏m where he played 65 matches in Tippeligaen from 1993 to 1996. He then moved to V√•lerenga where he played 45 league-matches between 1997 and 1999 and also won the Norwegian Football Cup in 1997. In 2000, Berntsen moved to the Austrian club SW Bregenz, where his former teammate from Lillestr√∏m, Jan Ove Pedersen also were playing. After playing three matches in six months for Bregenz, he was loaned out to Bryne where he played five matches in Tippeligaen before he retired after one season with B√¶rum in 2001 Norwegian Second Division. Managerial career In 2006, Berntsen was the head coach of the third-tier club L√∏renskog and John Carew's youth club was fighting promotion alongside Notodden. In the decisive match of 2006 Norwegian Second Division, Notodden won 5‚Äì3 against L√∏renskog at home, and was promoted to Adeccoligaen. Even though L√∏renskog was not promoted, Berntsen was head coach of a second-tier team in 2007 since Kongsvinger hired him as Vegard Skogheim's successor on 6 November 2006. Berntsen led Kongsvinger to a strong fourth place in 2007 Adeccoligaen, two points behind Bryne which played promotion play-off. With two points in the six first matches of the 2008-season, and Kongsvinger positioned at the bottom of the table, Berntsen was fired on 7 May 2008. On 3 August 2008 he was hired as head coach of his youth-club Str√∏mmen, and saved the club from relegation to Norwegian Third Division. Ahead of the 2009-season, Petter Myhre was named co- coach together with Berntsen. With Berntsen and Myhre as coaches, Str√∏mmen won their 2009 Norwegian Second Division group and was promoted to Adeccoligaen. In 2010 Str√∏mmen finished three points behind the play-off promotion. The next season, Myhre had resigned from the job at Str√∏mmen and was replaced by Andreas Holter which would be leading Str√∏mmen together with Berntsen. In the decisive match of the 2011-season, Str√∏mmen avoided relegation with a 6‚Äì1 win against Nybergsund. In July 2011, Nettavisen named Berntsen as one of the most talented football-coaches in Norway. Berntsen's contract ended after the 2011-season, and he was replaced by Erland Johnsen. In December 2011, Berntsen was linked to the vacant job as head coach of the Tippeliga-club Stab√¶k, but according to Norwegian TV 2 Berntsen recejeted Stab√¶k's offer. Ahead of the 2013 season he was named as director of sports in Sarpsborg 08 FF.https://www.sa.no/sport/thomas-berntsen-ny-sportssjef-i-08/s/1-101-6391886  References  Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Oslo Category:Norwegian footballers Category:Eliteserien players Category:Str√∏mmen IF players Category:Lillestr√∏m SK players Category:V√•lerenga Fotball players Category:SW Bregenz players Category:Bryne FK players Category:B√¶rum SK players Category:Norwegian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Austria Category:Norwegian expatriate sportspeople in Austria Category:Norwegian football managers Category:Kongsvinger IL Toppfotball managers Category:Str√∏mmen IF managers Category:Association football defenders Category:Sarpsborg 08 FF non-playing staff ","title":"Thomas Berntsen"},{"id":"33911992","text":"Eptazocine (Sedapain) is an opioid analgesic which was introduced in Japan by Morishita in 1987.

Pa. 1996) was decided on January 18, 1996 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.Michael A. Smyth v. The Pillsbury Company, 914 F. Supp. 97 (E.D. Pa. 1996) Michael A. Smyth was a regional operations manager at the Pillsbury Company. Smyth had a company email account that he was able to access from work and home. Pillsbury, on multiple occasions, told its employees that all email communications were private, confidential, and that there was no danger of the messages being intercepted and used as grounds for discipline or termination. In October 1994, while at home, Smyth received emails from his supervisor and, thinking that his replies would not be intercepted or used against him, made threatening comments. Pillsbury intercepted the emails and, despite the previous assurances made to the employees, terminated him. Smyth brought a wrongful discharge suit against Pillsbury, claiming that his right to privacy had been violated when his emails were intercepted. Ruling of the Court Judge Charles R. Weiner presided over the trial and authored the court's opinion. The decision was based on an examination of the common law exceptions to Pennsylvania's denial of a cause of action for the termination of an at-will employee. The court looked to the cases that stated a cause of action exists only where the termination of an at-will employee threatens or violates a clear mandate of public policy.Borse v. Piece Goods Shop, Inc., 963 F.2d 611, (3d Cir. 1992) Quoting an earlier Third Circuit decision, Judge Weiner defined a violation of a clear mandate of public policy as something that \\"strikes at the heart of a citizen's social right, duties and responsibilities.\\"Geary v. United States Steel Corp., 456 Pa. 171 (1974) Using this framework, the court evaluated Smyth's claim that his termination was based on a violation of his common law right to privacy and even went as far as to infer and analyze an argument based on estoppel. The court was not persuaded by the arguments and granted Pillsbury's motion to dismiss. Analysis Exceptions to Employer's Right to Terminate an At-Will Employee The Smyth decision reviewed the three exceptions to Pennsylvania's rule denying a wrongful discharge cause of action for at-will employees. An exception is only created when the termination of the employee threatens or violates a clear mandate of public policy. The three exceptions are: an employee may not be fired for serving jury duty,Reuther v. Fowler & Williams, Inc., 386 A.2d 119 (1978) employment may not be denied to a person with a prior conviction,Hunter v. Port Authority of Allegheny County, 419 A.2d 631 (1980) and an employee may not be terminated for reporting federal regulation violations to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.Field v. Philadelphia Electric Company, 565 A.2d 1170, 1180 (1989) The court stressed that public policy, without legislative guidance, must be determined on a case by case basis and is found in administrative rules, regulations, and judicial decisions. Smyth's Privacy Argument Smyth's assertion that his firing was a public policy violation was based on the court's decision in the Borse case. In Borse, the court found that, while an employer's firing of an employee for refusing to take a urinalysis test was not violating public policy under the Pennsylvania or United States' constitutions, it may have been a tortious invasion of privacy, a violation of Pennsylvania law. According to the Restatement (Second) of Torts ¬ß 652B, the tort of intrusion upon seclusion is: :One who intentionally intrudes, physically or otherwise, upon the solitude or seclusion of another or his private affairs or concerns, is subject to liability to the other for invasion of his privacy, if the intrusion would be highly offensive to a reasonable person.Restatement (Second) of Torts ¬ß 652B (1997) The Borse court added to the Restatement's standard, stating that a party would only be held liable when the \\"intrusion is substantial\\" and \\"highly offensive to the ordinary reasonable person.\\" The court set forth a simple balancing test in order to determine whether the invasion of privacy was substantial and highly offensive, weighing the employer's interest in keeping the workplace drug-free against the employee's privacy interest. Borse was remanded to allow the plaintiff to amend her complaint as there appeared to be a cause of action. In Smyth, the court found that even if an employer assures its employees that emails will not be intercepted, there is not a reasonable expectation of privacy in voluntary email communication through the company email system. The court distinguished this case from Borse on the facts that the Smyth's person and personal property were not searched and he was not required by Pillsbury to disclose any personal information. The court went on to hold that, even if there was an expectation of privacy in Smyth's emails, a reasonable person would not consider their interception a substantial and highly offensive invasion of privacy. Performing the balancing test that was set out in Borse, they found that Pillsbury's interest in preventing unprofessional or illegal activity on their email system outweighed any privacy interest that Smyth might have had in his messages. Smyth's Estoppel Argument In a footnote, the court addressed a claim that was not formally alleged in any of his pleadings. The court suggested that Smyth was alleging that there should be an exception to Pennsylvania's rule denying a wrongful discharge cause of action for at-will employees (based on estoppel) since Pillsbury had told Smyth and the other employees that their emails would not be intercepted and used as a basis for punishment and they had relied on those assurances to their detriment. This argument was dismissed, as the law in Pennsylvania is that an employer is not bound by estoppel when terminating employees, even when it can be shown that a promise was made and relied upon.Paul v. Lankenau Hospital, 569 A.2d 346 (1990) Implications The Smyth decision has been followed in many different jurisdictions. The basic principle set forth, that employees do not have a privacy interest in their company emails, is the majority rule. An employee may have a reasonable expectation of privacy in emails sent from a private account using an employee's computer. For example, The Supreme Court of New Jersey found that there is a privacy interest in an employee's email communications with their attorney, via a private account, that outweighs an employer's interest in preventing unprofessional or illegal activity.Stengart v.

Durgeshnandini is a story of the love triangle between Jagat Singh, a Mughal General, Tilottama, the daughter of a Bengali feudal lord and Ayesha, the daughter of a rebel Pathan leader against whom Jagat Singh was fighting. The story is set in the backdrop of Pathan-Mughal conflicts that took place in south-western region of modern-day Indian state of Paschimbanga (West Bengal) during the reign of Akbar. Durgeshnandini is the first Bengali novel written by Bankim Chandra as well as the first major Bengali novel in the history of Bengali literature. The story of the novel was borrowed from some local legends of Arambag region, Hooghly district, Paschimbanga, collected by Bankim Chandra‚Äôs great-uncle. Although the conservative critics mocked the lucidity of Bankim Chandra‚Äôs language, Durgeshnandini was highly praised by most of the contemporary scholars and newspapers.  Synopsis  The story is set in the backdrop of Pathan-Mughal conflicts that took place in south-western region of modern-day Indian state of Paschimbanga (West Bengal) during the reign of Akbar. Jagat Singh, a General of Mughal army and son of Raja Man Singh met Tilottama, daughter of Birendra Singha, a feudal lord of south-western Bengal in Mandaran (in modern-day Hooghly district, West Bengal) and they fell in love with each other. While they were preparing for a marriage ceremony, Katlu Khan, a rebel Pathan leader attacked Mandaran. Birendra Singha died in the battle and Jagat Singh was imprisoned along with Birendra‚Äôs widow Bimala and their daughter Tilottama. Katlu Khan‚Äôs daughter Ayesha saved Tilottama from her father‚Äôs lust, but Ayesha herself fell in love with Jagat Singh. Later, Bimala avenged her husband‚Äôs death by stabbing Katlu Khan. In the meantime, Man Singh signed a pact with the Pathans and they set Jagat Singh free. But Ayesha‚Äôs lover Osman challenged Jagat Singh in a duel which Jagat Singh won. Realising that Jagat Singh who was a Hindu prince would never marry a Muslim woman, Ayesha gave up hope for him, but she eventually helped Tilottama marry Jagat Singh.  Sources  Sukumar Sen commented, ‚ÄúBhudev Mukharji‚Äôs Anguriyabinimay supplied the nucleus of the plot [of Durgeshnandini] which was modelled somewhat after Scott‚Äôs Ivanhoe.‚Äù Although, Bankim Chandra‚Äôs younger brother Purna Chandra Chattopadhyay stated that their great-uncle told Bankim Chandra of a popular legend of Mandaran which he collected from Bishnupur- Arambag region. According to the legend, the Pathans attacked the fort of the local feudal lord and took him and his wife and daughter to Orissa as prisoners and when Jagat Singh was sent to rescue them, he was also imprisoned. Bankim Chandra heard the story when he was 19 years old and after a few years he wrote Durgeshnandini. Bankim Chandra himself dismissed any presumption of whether his novel was influenced by Ivanhoe, stating he never read Scott‚Äôs romance before writing Durgeshnandini. Asit Kumar Bandyopadhyay also wrote that apart from the love-triangle between Jagat Singh, Ayesha and Tilottama which closely resembles that of Ivanhoe, Rebecca and Rowena in Ivanhoe, there is not much similarity between the two novels. He thus concluded that Durgeshnandini is Bankim Chandra‚Äôs original work. Date and text 13 editions of the novel were published during the lifetime of Bankim Chandra, the last being in 1893. It was translated into English (1882), Hindustani (1876), Hindi (1882) and Kannada (1885). It was first adopted for stage in 1873. Reception Durgeshnandini received mixed response from contemporary critics. While the Sanskrit scholars of Bhatpara appreciated the novel, scholars of Calcutta did not. Dwarakanath Vidyabhushan, the editor of Somprakash mocked Bankim Chandra‚Äôs lucid language and unconventional style; although Sambad Prabhakar and some other contemporary newspapers highly praised the novel. Sukumar Sen wrote, ‚Äú‚Ä¶the tale was something that was wholly new and entirely delightful. The pseudo-historical background was a justification for a pure love romance intended for readers who knew only married love.‚Äù Film adaptations Bengali *1927: Durgesh Nandini, starring Durgadas Bannerjee, Kanu Bannerjee, Ahindra Choudhury, Indira Devi, Sita Devi, directed by Priyanath N.

Although he is best known for his large-scale oratorio, Slavery Documents, most of his works were composed for small chamber ensembles. Sur was born in Honolulu and moved with his family to Los Angeles after World War II. He studied at the University of California and Princeton before spending four years in Korea researching ancient Korean court music. After receiving his doctorate from Harvard in 1972, he settled in Boston, Massachusetts, where many of his works were premiered and where he taught at several local universities, including Harvard, MIT, and Tufts. Life and career Donald Sur was born in Honolulu in 1935 to parents of Korean descent. His paternal grandfather had emigrated to Hawaii in 1903 to work in the sugarcane plantations. His mother was a Korean picture bride.Seo (2001) p. 85 The first instrument he learned to play as a child was the ukulele; the second was the mandolin, which remained his favorite instrument throughout his life and figures in several of his scores. Sur's family moved to the mainland United States in 1951 and eventually settled in Los Angeles. He studied ethnomusicology for a year at UCLA as an undergraduate before transferring to Berkeley and studying with Andrew Imbrie, Seymour Shifrin, and Colin McPhee, who taught him Balinese composition techniques.Dyer (18 March 1990) Following post-graduate work at Princeton with Roger Sessions and Earl Kim, he spent four years in Korea (1964‚Äì68) doing research on Korean court music. On his return from Korea, he continued his post-graduate studies at Harvard University where he received a PhD in composition in 1972 with The Sleepwalker's Ballad, \\"an accompanied recitative for soprano and chamber ensemble\\".Harvard University Department of Music. PhD Recipients and Dissertations 1956‚Äìpresent . Retrieved 30 November 2011. After graduating from Harvard, he remained based in the Boston area for the rest of his life, combining his career as a composer with teaching at Harvard, MIT, Tufts, Wellesley and Boston University, and for a while running a small publishing company for composers of new music as well as organizing concerts of their works with John Harbison. March 1990 saw the world premiere at Symphony Hall, Boston of Sur's most famous work, Slavery Documents, an oratorio for 80 voices with a libretto by the composer. Sur's last works were Berceuse, a lullaby for violin and piano, which premiered at the Library of Congress in February 1999, and an a cappella setting of Shakespeare's Sonnet 97, which premiered at Boston's Jordan Hall in May 1999, three weeks before his death from cancer at the age of 64.New York Times (29 May 1999) In 2008, John Harbison, who described his friend as having \\"a unique ear for the incantatory power of percussion instruments\\",Harbison (2011) composed Cort√®ge for six percussionists: In memoriam Donald Sur as a tribute to him. Style and compositions Sur's musical style has been described as uniquely personal, \\"eclectic\\", and \\"unpredictable\\", and ranged from atonal and minimalist to neo- tonal.New York Times (29 May 1999); Dyer (25 May 1999); Dyer (18 March 1990) He sometimes used unconventional instruments in his scores such as banjos, bongo drums, Korean trumpets and even a skillet, conch shell, and bullwhip. His later music often incorporated musical references to a variety of styles and periods, including Baroque, Impressionist, popular dance tunes, and traditional Korean music.See Oteri (26 January 2010); Gehman (31 October 1986); and Carl (March 2010). The skillet, conch shell, and bullwhip are used in Red Dust. Two of Sur's works were on explicitly Korean themes: his 1991 Lacrimosa dies illa (Day of Tears) for chamber orchestra commemorating the March 1919 Korean uprising against Japanese rule; and his 1993 Kumdori Tansaeng (Birth of the Dream-Elf) for solo violin, chorus, and orchestra, commissioned by the Taejon International Exposition for Korean American violinist Sarah Chang. Sur also composed the score for Dai Sil Kim-Gibson's 1999 film Silence Broken, a documentary about the Korean \\"comfort women\\" of World War II. Slavery Documents Slavery Documents, an oratorio in two parts for 80-voice chorus, five soloists, and large orchestra (including an organ), is Sur's only large-scale work, and the one for which he is most remembered. A commission from the Cantata Singers and Ensemble, it premiered at Symphony Hall, Boston, on 23 March 1990, conducted by David Hoose. Sur wrote the libretto himself based on a variety of texts and documents relating to slavery, including passages from the Bible, Cotton Mather's The Negro Christianised, the 1831 confessions of Nat Turner, descriptions of slave punishments published by the American abolitionist Theodore Weld in American Slavery As It Is, pre-Civil War advertisements for runaway slaves, Negro spirituals, and Stephen Foster's sentimental ballad \\"Old Folks at Home\\". The eclectic score, which Sur worked on for three years, was completed in December 1998 and marked a departure from his earlier predominantly atonal style. For the premiere, the 40-member (all-white) chorus of the Cantata Singers was supplemented with 40 African American singers from the Boston area. The soloists were Jane Bryden, soprano; Bonita Hyman, mezzo-soprano; Rockland Osgood, tenor; Gary Burgess, tenor (as Nat Turner); and David Arnold, baritone. Sur received a standing ovation from the audience at the premiere, but the critical reception was mixed. Boston Globe critic Richard Dyer noted \\"some peculiar and unconvincing stresses in the setting of the text, some music that sounds merely bombastic, and some unidiomatic writing for the soloists in difficult registers,\\" but found the piece emotionally powerful and concluded that \\"the flaws are not important in the context of an overwhelming achievement.\\"Dyer (24 March 1990) John Rockwell, writing in The New York Times, was more critical, describing both the score and the libretto as artistically unconvincing. He echoed Dyer's comments about the setting of the music for the soloists but also found that Sur's \\"attempts to incorporate vernacular idioms and historical styles failed to resonate: they were just stuck onto the score, ornamentally, without development or conviction.\\"Rockwell (29 March 1990) As part of the country's annual Liberation Day celebrations, Slavery Documents received its Korean premiere in August 1990 at the Seoul Arts Center, performed by the Korean Broadcasting System orchestra conducted by David Hoose and a chorus of 100 Korean singers.Dyer (30 June 1990) Sur amassed far more texts for his libretto than he was able to use, and at the time of his death in 1999 was working on a sequel that would incorporate some of them. As a memorial to Sur, the Cantata Singers commissioned his friend T. J. Anderson to compose a companion oratorio, Slavery Documents 2. Its libretto was based on texts from Loren Schweininger's collection The Southern Debate Over Slavery but incorporated one of the original sentences from Sur's work. The oratorios by Sur and Anderson were performed together by the Cantata Singers on 17 March 2002 at Boston's Symphony Hall. Part I of Sur's Slavery Documents received another performance in 2010 by the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the combined glee clubs of Morehouse College and Spelman College in a concert (also broadcast on National Public Radio) for Atlanta's Martin Luther King Day celebrations.Titcomb (18 April 2002); Paulk (16 January 2010) Other principal compositions *Catena I, II, and III, for small ensemble (1961; Catena I revised 1970, Catena II revised 1962, Catena III revised 1976).

Life Hassek descended from a musical family. At the age of 14 he attended the Potansky music school in Vienna and thereafter studied composition at the Vienna Academy for Music under Joseph Marx, and Rudolf Kattnigg as well as piano under Eugenie Wild- Volek and Ludwig Czaczkes. From 1944 until 1954 Theo Hassek performed as pianist and interpreter of his own works. His pianistic repertoire ranged from Johann Sebastian Bach to the 20th century and comprised also technically demanding works such as Ravels \\"Gaspard de la Nuit\\", \\"Miroirs\\", Balakirews \\"Islamey\\" and Liszts h-moll-Sonata. 1950 he passed the exam for piano and 1952 got his matriculation exam for composition theory. After three years as head of the music school in Kittsee (1951 to 1953) he decided for an \\"ordinary\\" occupation and worked as agent for a publishing house, as warehouse keeper and for property management. Beside he composed several music works amongst others for the subsequent composer and clarinet of the Vienna Phlharmonic Orchestra Arnold Hartl. 1957 he married Ingeborg Smolik. After 1962 he turned back towards music an actively played as member of the three-man band \\"The Gamblers\\" together with his cousin Erhard Hassek beat and dancing music. After a number of engagements in shady bars they succeeded a breakthrough at the winter Olympic games at Innsbruck 1964 where they performend at the Sporthotel in Axamer Lizum. From now on the band was assigned at Intercont Hotels in Genf, Frankfurt, Hannover, D√ºsseldorf and Vienna. After the birth of his son Helmut (born 1967) the family moved back to Vienna in 1971. From 1971 Hassek turned also to traditional Vienna music \\"Wienerlied\\" and performed at Heurigen Christ 42 in Vienna Stammersdorf and at Bach-Hengl in Grinzing, where he was part of the band \\"Die Charmanten Wiener\\". Apart from a few performances at four-hand piano (together with his longtime partner Helmut Hofmann) he terminated his career of an active musician due to health reasons in 1983 but henceforth worked as an editor and arranger for vor Vienna based publishers (i. a. Weltmusik Hochmuth-Verlag, Hermann Schneider). In those days he arranged over 500 Werke (predominantly easy listening) for piano. He retired 1988 but kept composing. Theodor Hassek died from heart disease on 28 October 2009.http://regionaut.meinbezirk.at/tulln-an-der-donau/kultur/lass-dich-von- der-muse-kuessen-d26866.html Works Theodor Hassek composed over 100 works of various genres, from neoclassical piano and chamber music works, piano works of higher level, pop music, traditional Vienna music \\"Wienerlied\\" to spiritual music (mass). His legislating is characterized by the principlet that music should be pleasure for the listener. Problematic music won't be found among his works. Nevertheless, all works are distinguished by inventive ideas, diligent elaboration, exhilarant shortness and the absence of importunate redundancy. Although his compositions have an unmistakable typical piano sound they are predominantly committed to the form rather than the sound. Hence transcriptions of earlier works written for other instruments can be found in the chamber music as well as in compositions for two and four handed piano. In his last years he devoted the composing of spiritual choral works ‚Äì stimulated by Josef B√∂ck ‚Äì whose performance he missed. The originals of his notes, manual sketches and some recordings are in possession of the family and will be given to the \\"Musiksammlung der Wienbibliothek im Rathaus\\" in Vienna at a later moment.

Originally designed as a hobby kit, the Maximite was introduced in a three-part article in Silicon Chip magazine in autumn of 2011 by Australian designer Geoff Graham.Silicon Chip magazine, March, April, May 2011 The project consists of two main components ‚Äî a main circuit board and the MMBasic Interpreter, styled after GW-BASIC. Versions Maximite version 2.7 is still an open source project. Several hobbyists have produced their own custom versions, often using commercially available prototyping circuit boards. Clones Several Maximite clones were designed and released in the months following its introduction. Some, such as the Maximite SM1, and Geoff Graham's latest version,Silicon Chip magazine November 2011 the Mini-Maximite, are hardware- and software-compatible with the original design, but use a different form factor. Others, like the DuinoMite, from the Bulgarian company Olimex, have altered the hardware by adding Arduino headers. This makes it easier to use hardware designed for Arduino boards, but modified firmware is needed to use this functionality. Some of these changes have been incorporated in the official version as it gets updated. Australian Distributor Dontronics and United States programmer Ken Segler have been active in adapting the software to run on the different versions of the hardware. Geoff Graham has also released an altered version of MMBasic for the UBW32 development Board. Maximite clones made by US producer CircuitGizmos remain compatible with the original Maximite design and include a very small CGMMSTICK1 that can be used with solderless breadboards, and a Colour Maximite compatible CGCOLORMAX1. MMBasic MMBasic 3.x has support for user defined subroutines and modern Line-numberless structure. This MMBasic 3.x has been released in several versions including support for the Olimex Duinomite, UBW32 and CGMMStick variants. While the versions of MMBasic prior to 3.x were available as free and open-source software distributed under the GNU General Public License, for the 3.x versions the license was changed to a proprietary one, with the source code available free of charge for personal use. ICeemite On 11 May 2013, an IC-style version named DTX2-4105C (later given the name \\"ICeemite\\"), entirely designed for inclusion into embedded systems was announced by the Australian company Dimitech. This new revision of the original Maximite brings a real-time clock and a microSD card connector on board and fits into a PLCC-68 socket. As of the day of announcement it was the world's smallest full Maximite system. ICeemite offers custom built firmware with additional extras used in embedded systems such as multitasking and power management, but does not support colour graphics. Colour Maximite Color Maximite (CircuitGizmos CGCOLORMAX1) showing all of the graphics modes A new version of the Maximite was featured in the September 2012 Issue of Silicon Chip Magazine. New features in the Colour Maximite are. * 100pin Version PIC32 * Colour VGA with eight colours (black, red, green, blue, cyan, yellow, purple and white). * Synthesised stereo music and sound effects. * Battery backed real time clock (optional). * Arduino compatible connector with an additional 20 I/O lines that are independent of the original 20 I/Os. * 2 channel PWM analog output. * Special commands for animated games. * Version 4.0 of MMBasic which has extra commands to access and utilise the additional features. Several software and hardware projects have been utilizing the Maximite in the 12 months since it was first announced. These range from simple dataloggers to complex process controllers.

Allen Feldman stated that \\"the event is not what happens. The event is that which can be narrated\\". Because photography captures single discrete moments, and narrative, as described by Jerome Bruner is irreducibly temporal, it might seem photography cannot actually represent narrative structure. Susan Sontag made this objection in her book, On Photography: ‚ÄúThe ultimate wisdom of the photographed image is to say: ‚ÄòThere is the surface. Now think ‚Äî or, rather, feel, intuit ‚Äî what is beyond it.‚Äô Strictly speaking, there is never any understanding in a photograph, but only an invitation to fantasy and speculation... It is doubtful that a photograph can help us understand anything. A photograph of the Krupp [munitions] factory, as Brecht points out, tells us little about this institution. The ‚Äòreality‚Äô of the world is not in its images, but in its functions. Functioning takes place in time, and must be explained in time. Only that which narrates can make us understand.‚Äù The same objection could apply to painting, sculpture, mosaic, drawing ‚Äî any medium that presents a single image for appreciation and contemplation. However, it could be argued that photography and the traditional arts both tell stories and give accounts, with this difference: In painting, the artist puts meaning into the picture. In photography, the photographer invites us to get meaning out of the picture. The Narrative Photography Competition in Portland, Oregon describes the concept of narrative photography: \\"The power of narrative, or story telling is at the foundation of much of photography. Photographers are creating complex and descriptive moments in time. Contemporary photographers are crafting and documenting new forms of a visual short story.\\" Examples of narrative photography include the work of Gregory Crewdson, and Steve Giovinco, both graduates of the Yale School of Art Department of Photography.

The common perception of this ideal is a woman who possesses a slender, feminine physique with a small waist and little body fat. The size that the thin ideal woman should be is decreasing while the rate of female obesity is simultaneously increasing, making this iconic body difficult for women to maintain.Pinhas, Leora, Brenda B. Toner, Alisha Ali, Paul E. Garfinkel, and Noreen Stuckless. \\"The Effects of the Ideal of Female Beauty on Mood and Body Satisfaction.\\" International Journal of Eating Disorders (1998): 223-26. This creates a gap between the actual appearance of an average woman‚Äôs body and its expected appearance which, depending on the extent to which a woman internalizes the necessity of living up to this ideal for her well-being and peace of mind, may have serious psychological effects.  Internalization  The degree to which women are psychologically affected by the thin ideal depends to what extent the ideal is internalized. An article from a journal written by Ahern, et al. highlights these ideals. Women generally relate the ideally thin body to positive life outcomes such as happiness, confidence, and romantic success, and consequently a majority of women value the thin ideal to some extent. However, it is important to recognize the distinction between women who are aware of the advantage of thinness versus those who internalize the ideal and make it a personal belief system. Although the idea of the thin ideal seems omnipresent, not all women identify with the ideal in the same manner and not all are affected by it negatively. For example, after seeing an image of a thin woman in the media, some women may fantasize themselves as thinner and more attractive. To some, this exposure to the thin ideal may make thinness seem more attainable and act as a motivational factor in self-improvement.  Studies  Many studies have been performed regarding the effect of the thin ideal. Some of these indicate that after women are shown images of ultra-thin models, they experience psychological and behavioral features associated with eating disorders, such as increased anger, depressed mood, body dissatisfaction, and low self-esteem. The images had an immediate negative effect on the mood of the participating women. In a study conducted by Halliwar and Dittmar (2004), of 202 UK women, they found that those exposed to thin models created greater body-image anxiety in women who internalised the thin ideal compared to those who were exposed to average-sized models. Another study demonstrated that positive associations women made with underweight models frequently led to weight-focused anxiety and an elevated drive for thinness, both of which are principal symptoms of eating disorders. Several longitudinal studies have suggested that internalization of the thin ideal is a precursor to body image dissatisfaction and unnecessary dieting in women of a healthy weight.Juarascio, Adrienne S., Evan M. Forman, C. Alix Timko, James D. Herbert, Meghan Butryn, and Michael Lowe. \\"Implicit Internalization of the Thin Ideal as a Predictor of Increases in Weight, Body Dissatisfaction, and Disordered Eating.\\" Eating Behaviors 12.3 (2011): 207-13. As Evans stated in the Psychology of Women Quarterly, ‚ÄúWomen often feel dissatisfied with their appearance after comparing themselves to other females who epitomize the thin- ideal standard of beauty.‚Äù  Development  A study by Mia Sypeck of The American University‚Äôs Department of Psychology examined the covers of the four most popular fashion magazines over the last fifty years.Sypeck, Mia F., James J. Gray, and Anthony H. Ahrens. \\"No Longer Just a Pretty Face: Fashion Magazines' Depictions of Ideal Female Beauty from 1959 to 1999.\\" International Journal of Eating Disorders (2003): 342-47. Several trends were discovered. Firstly, the body size of fashion models decreased, indicating that the thin ideal has been shrinking in size. Secondly, there was a substantial rise in pictures that show the female body, which suggests that society has been placing more value on the way women's bodies appear.  Media  Many theorists believe that the ultra-thin images in the media play a significant part in the influence of body dissatisfaction, disordered eating, and internalization of the thin ideal. A correlational study by Stice et al. (2004) suggests that a larger number of media exposures may be linked to a greater risk of body dissatisfaction, internalization of the thin ideal, and development of eating disorders symptoms. However, few of the population in the study actually developed clinical eating disorders, and as the study was correlational, the said causes and effects may not be directly linked. For example, many women enjoy looking at fashion magazines for entertainment and do not experience immediate negative effects. Consequently, the theory that the media directly influences low self-esteem and body image dissatisfaction may be too simple.  Social influences  Contents of \\"thin-ideal media\\" include the portrayal of thinness as a desirable trait, and protagonists in media are thin, exceptionally beautiful, desirable, and successful. According to the sociocultural model of bulimia, eating disorders are a product of the increasing pressures for women in our society to achieve an ultra-slender body. There are two components to the social comparison theory: Downward social comparison, comparison to others perceived to be less fortunate than ourselves, and usually serves to enhance mood or self-worth; upward social comparison, comparison to others we perceive as socially better than ourselves, which usually leads to negative moods and self-evaluation. In order to attempt to measure women's media-ideal internalization and comparison, researchers developed the Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire. Women with a high degree of internalization are more likely to use thin-ideal media images as an upward comparison target and consequently feel that they do not meet the thin-ideal standard of attractiveness. Women in the media are presented as having different roles in society depending on context and demographics. Television, magazines, and newspapers along with advertisements have a powerful and influential role in society, and women in the media are often role models for young, impressionable girls. Mass media affect dominant societal values and can influence the population. \\"Of the many variables thought to promote eating pathology, sociocultural factors are considered paramount.\\" Media-portrayed idealized images of the female body shape are linked to body dissatisfaction among women. The effects of these images have also been linked to other problems among women including depression, obesity, and extreme dieting. \\"The sociocultural etiological model is based on the premise that societal factors send powerful messages to girls and young women that certain physical attributes are unacceptable.\\" Women are presented with thin-ideal images on a regular basis and are conditioned to compare themselves to these images; research shows that women with high body image self-discrepancy are more at risk of negative correlations from exposure to thin-ideal media. \\"Self-discrepancies are representations in the self- concept of ways in which one falls short of some important standard.\\" Women who possess a body image self-discrepancy associate failure to reach a thin- ideal with their self-concept. Research shows that only women who were dissatisfied with their physical appearance had concerns regarding social comparison to the thin ideal.  Impact on women  Correlational studies have linked exposure to media that contain ultra-thin ideals to increased body-dissatisfaction, thin-ideal internalization, self-discrepancies, and eating pathology in young women. Sociocultural theory maintains that current societal standards for beauty emphasize the desirability of thinness, and thinness at a level impossible for many women to achieve by healthy means. Photo manipulation that elongates legs and narrows hips of already skinny models have harmful effects on young women because they compare themselves to those images. Idealized images also suggest that real women do not measure up to such presentations of beauty, and they cannot reasonably obtain such physical expectations. The standard media-portrayed thin ideal woman is about 15% below the average female body weight, \\"This ideal stresses slimness, youth and androgyny, rather than the normative female body. The thin-ideal woman portrayed in the media is biogenetically difficult, if not impossible, for the majority of women\\" to achieve. Studies show the degree of thin-ideal internalization is correlated with the severity of eating disorder pathology. \\"Evidence also has shown that endorsement of the thin-ideal correlates with both bulimic symptoms and subsequent diagnosis of bulimia.\\" Stice and Shaw suggested in a study done in 1994 that thin-ideal media body images may produce negative mood states in women. Prolonged exposure to the thin-ideal can cause women to compare themselves to these images and lead to feelings of inadequacy. Stice and Shaw suggested that women who over-internalize the thin- ideal image tend to experience increased body dissatisfaction and a decrease in self-esteem. As women over-internalize they may set unrealistic goals for themselves regarding their body dimension. \\"Those who have over-internalized the thin-ideal stereotype are convinced that achieving a thin-ideal body is the only way to be popular, loveable, successful, and happy.\\" When it comes to the impact on women's self-esteem, exposure to thin models does not necessarily mean that there will be a negative impact. The way that the models are presented makes a difference. A study has shown that there is a positive impact on women's self-esteem when they are shown moderately thin, not extremely thin models. One study has shown that exposure to extremely thin and extremely heavy models both have a negative effect on the way that some women in the study might see their own bodies. As for models that are only moderately thin or moderately heavy there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a negative impact but a positive one on self-image. (Smeesters and Mandel 581).‚Äù If the media started to do this more when it comes to models an increase of self-esteem could happen.\\"Positive And Negative Media Image Effects On The Self.\\" Journal of Consumer Research 32.4 (2006): 576-582. Academic Search Complete. Web. 6 Mar. 2016.  Women in magazines  Women's magazines focus mainly on \\"domestic\\" aspects of life, including marriage, child-rearing, beauty, etc.(Gaye Tuchman. The Symbolic Annihilation of Women by the Mass Media) More than 75% of women‚Äôs magazines include at least one ad or article about how to change their physical appearance by diet, exercise, or cosmetic surgery. Twenty-five percent of the magazines contained messages regarding weight loss and dieting suggestions. Many women's magazines focus on how to lead a better life by improving physical appearance, while men's magazines provide information about hobbies, activities, and entertainment. When women are constantly exposed to ways to alter their appearance, they may over- internalize and feel pressure to look like the images they see. The analyses of images in women's magazines observed from 1901 to 1980 and from 1959 to 1999 show that the featured models have become thinner over time, making the thin ideal even more difficult to achieve.  Women on television  According to researchers, 94% of females on television are thinner than the average women (168.5lbs)https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_03/sr03_039.pdf in the United States. It is normal in society today for women to work and provide an income, but it is still common for women on television to be portrayed in traditional female roles. According to the study done by Donald M. Davis, \\"While many of society's institutions have moved forward with respect to women, television may be lagging behind, at least as evidenced by demographic variables.\\"  Modeling  The top modeling and fashion industries often embrace the ultra-thin appearance. A majority of elite models are approximately 20% underweight, exceeding the anorexia nervosa indicator of 15% underweight. Fashion models and modeling agencies are often blamed for the societal pressures that cause young women to develop eating disorders. Others argue that modeling agencies and fashion cannot be blamed for the disordered eating behavior of easily influenced adolescents. However, after several incidents in which models died from anorexia nervosa, such as the case of Ana Carolina Reston, several major fashion modeling events have adopted new policies to encourage healthy body weights.\\"The Skinny on Models.\\" Weekly Reader Corporation 2011: 7. For example, Madrid Fashion Week officials banned models with a body mass index lower than eighteen. Comparable guidelines have been adopted in similar fashion events in other countries, such as Brazil and Argentina.

History Prior to Montessori's arrival in India, such visionaries as Rabindranath Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi were aware of her pedagogical method. By 1929, Tagore had founded many \\"Tagore-Montessori\\" schools in India (including at Shantiniketan), and Indian interest in Montessori education was strongly represented at the International Congress in 1929. Maria Montessori's work in India formally began with her arrival there in 1939. Montessori education was established in India in the form of preschools and schools that are now affiliated with Association Montessori Internationale. Maria Montessori also was responsible for the creation of a teacher training centre in the neighbourhood of Adyar, Madras (present-day Chennai). Her work continued on in India through her designated representatives, Albert M. Joosten and S. R. Swamy, before spreading further. In 1939, leaders of The Theosophical Society (namely, George S. Arundale and Rukmini Devi Arundale ‚Äì husband and wife) extended an invitation to the 69-year-old Montessori. She accepted the invitation and reached India the same year. She made Adyar, Chennai her home and lived there along with her son, Mario M. Montessori. The famous Montessorians, Gool Minwala, Tehmina Wadia and Khurshed Taraporewala were students in the first training at Adyar. In 1940, when India entered World War II, Montessori and her son were interned as enemy aliens in India, but despite this Maria was allowed to conduct training courses. Sixteen courses were conducted during this time, creating a very strong base for the method here. She also had her own school in Kodaikanal for this duration. In 1947, she went back to Europe for a brief period. Montessori returned to India for a second time the same year to conduct a few more courses in Chennai, Pune, Ahmedabad and Karachi. The Montessoris then returned to Europe, leaving Albert Max Joosten as their representative in India. Maria Montessori died in 1952 in Holland at the age of 81.  Modern Day Montessori Education in India  Unlike many Montessori learning centers, schools in India do not always abide by the mixed age group procedure. This method allows older children to assist in guiding the younger children in their groups. Groups are based upon interest and experiences rather than the capability or skill of a student. Indian Montessori Training Courses (IMTC) To create an official structure for Joosten's work, an organisation was created by the name of Indian Montessori Training Courses (IMTC) in 1949. It was an organisation originally consisting mainly of Joosten and Swamy. This travelling institution moved from city to city until Swamy's retirement in 1990. Ex-students from previous trainings working in the locality were called upon to be assistants. After Swamy's retirement, IMTC ran under the Directorship of Meenakshi Shivaramakrishnan. IMTC is now based in Bangalore. By the next decade, new branches were created at Chennai under the name CMTC. Thereafter man more branches were created including in Gurgaon in 2016, IMTC Gurgaon. Indian Institute for Montessori Studies (IIMS) Indian Montessori Center invited Rajendra K. Gupta to conduct a primary Montessori training at Bangalore in 1996. This was the first such course to be conducted in India after Montessori left the country. However, IMC discontinued the course that same year. To preserve the method thereafter, Rajendra K. Gupta set up Indian Institute for Montessori Studies with himself as the Director, Radha Nagaraj as the co- Director, with the help of a few of his students. IIMS continues to be a rarity where the work is carried out by a committee rather than an individual, adding more faculty over the years.  Indian Montessori Foundation (IMF)  At present, there are four AMI Montessori centres in India: Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad and Mumbai. Other Primary Montessori training courses After the popularising of the Primary Montessori Training by IIMS, several schools offering this method at the primary level came up in Bangalore, Tumkur, Chennai and Trichy. This has encouraged other pre-primary based institutions to branch out into this area. Both IMTC and Navadisha Montessori Institute have offered primary Montessori training from time to time.  The City Montessori School  The City Montessori School (CMS) is located in Delhi, the capital of India. The curriculum is built upon four core concepts: universal values, excellence, global understanding, and service. In the late twentieth century the teachings were reflective of the current conflicts between Hindus and Buddhists in the region. The school hosted a social movement to promote unity between the members of these two religious groups. This movement reflects the school's objective of promoting international- mindedness upon its members. This can be seen through the service programs that are offered at the school. These allow students to take part in their local government. In an essay from 1996, Carolyn Cottom notes that the school's objective is to prepare its students for the complex issues of society that occur at the global level. Students are taken to visit the various places of worship in India. They are also taught about peace education; students learn that 'the Golden Rule' is a concept that is often taught across all world religions. Furthermore, the teachers role is not only to teach subjects to students but to act as mentors in the child's spiritual journey. The school works towards aligning the values taught through Montessori education with the ones taught to the child at home. To achieve this goal, the school offers incentives and recognition to parents to display involvement in their child's education. People behind the Montessori movement in India It has taken many years' work by many to make the Montessori method popular in India. The city of Bangalore, just by itself, has experienced an increase in the number of such schools from six in 1990 to more than a hundred currently. This growth of the movement was sustained by the following people and their students, who held it together with their personal efforts and charisma. Albert M. Joosten Albert M. Joosten Albert M. Joosten, a renowned Montessori trainer, was trained by Montessori in 1934. He worked in Montessori schools (pre-primary and elementary) in Berlin, Amsterdam, London and Laren (Netherlands) and assisted Maria and Mario Montessori and at International Montessori Training Courses and Conferences all over Europe. In 1949, he was appointed Director of the Indian Montessori Training Courses, India, Joosten co-founded the Good Shepherd Maria Montessori Training Center at Colombo (Sri Lanka) in 1957. In 1973, he was appointed, on behalf of the Association Montessori International, Director of the Montessori Training Center of Minnesota, U.S.A. He was the director of all these training centers until his death in 1980. Joosten conducted workshops and lectures in India, the USA, Canada and several European countries and was speaker at several International Montessori Conference in Europe and the USA. He translated and cooperated with the translation of several of Montessori's books in English, Dutch, German and Portuguese. He continued to be the Director of IMTC till his demise in 1980. S. R. Swamy S. R. Swamy took Montessori training with Montessori at Kodaikanal. He worked in various schools in India until 1951. He was first Assistant to Joosten and a trainer at the Indian Montessori Training Courses from 1951 to 1980. He became the Director of the training from 1980 to 1990. Meenakshi Shivaramakrishnan To read about her, please look below under the See also section Rajendra K. Gupta Gupta took his Montessori pre-primary training with Joosten in India in 1953 on the recommendation of the headmaster of the school in which he was working at Muzzafarnagar. After working for several years at his old school and at the AMI school of Gwalior, he moved to Delhi. When Joosten conducted his 6th ‚Äì 8th course in Delhi, Gupta acted as his assistant. His wife, Urmila Gupta also took her training at this period and joined him in his work for nearly a decade. When the Birth Centenary celebrations of Montessori was organised in New Delhi, he was in charge. A postage stamp was released on the occasion. V. V. Giri, President of India, presided over the function. Two years later, he left for US. Gupta stayed in touch with Joosten until his death in 1980, even visiting him during the latter's visit to Minnesota. Gupta took his elementary training with Margaret Stevenson in the USA in 1978. Later he completed his Master of Education degree from Century University, New Mexico, USA. He worked in AMI Montessori Houses of Children for about 20 years in India and the USA and in AMI elementary Montessori Schools for 25 years in the USA. Gupta was a Montessori trainer for both pre-primary and primary levels with the Southwest Montessori Training Center, Denton, Texas, USA for about ten years. He also gave orientation courses in Montessori Education at the College of St Scholastica, Duluth, Minnesota, and at the Chicago Community College, Illinois, USA. He was an Adjunct Professor with the University of Texas A & I, Kingsville, Texas, USA where he gave a pre-primary Montessori course to the Master of Education students. Mr. Gupta gave workshops in India as well as in the USA on various subjects during 45 years of his teaching career. He has written manuals for Montessori teachers in the areas of botany, zoology, and language, and published classroom materials on science, language, botany, zoology, and history. He has also published books written by Albert Joosten and other Montessorians. Currently he is the Director of the Indian Institute for Montessori Studies which is conducting Pre-primary cum Elementary course in Bangalore, India. Radha Nagaraj Radha Nagaraj was a product of the infant Montessori school at Hymamshu. She took her pre-primary Montessori training from Joosten and Swamy in 1967‚Äì68 at the behest of the then Director, Sundaramma. She also set up a new Montessori at Mahila Mandali and worked there under the guidance of Swamy for ten years. Joosten came to Bangalore in 1978. Radha Nagaraj acted as his assistant for two years. She continued to work in Mahila Mandali since then as a Director. She took up assistance at IMTC from 1997 under Swamy, and continued to work there till 2002. She also handled the training in Kannada till 2004. The post of the co- Director of the pre-primary-cum-primary course at IIMS became hers in 2000, which continues to be hers till now. Radhaji has presented papers at the seminars organized by the Indian Montessori Center at Bangalore and at the celebration of 50 years of Montessori held at Chennai in 1989. She has been consulting with organisations like the Shreyas Foundation school at Ahmedabad and the Balasevika shibira of Vishva Hindu Parishad since 1990. She contributes articles to various Montessori publications in India. Montessori Associations linked to Training Institutions As training institutions grew and set roots in one place, they grew societies to support their students in their work in the field. They also helped in the work of propagation, and brought together all those interested in the method, be they Montessorians, parents, school management or public. We list here some of the prominent ones. Indian Montessori Center (IMC) Government regulations in India state that no education institution can be run by an individual. To solve that issue, IMC, a registered society was created in 1990 with S.R Swamy as the first chairman. Later, Meenakshi Sivaramakrishna continued as the Directess while Dr. Ing. B V A Rao a retired Professor from IIT Madras, took over as the chairman of IMC, which had its office in Malleswaram, Bangalore. The Training Course IMTC was also attached to this office. Another center was also begun in South Bangalore. With all these new changes, AMI disaffiliated IMTC in 1999. IMTC came under the umbrella of IMC instead. Now, IMC has several chapters which operate in different states .Even in Kolkata there is IMC. IMC has its Northern India Chapter in Gurgaon. Both the IMC North India Chapter and IMTC Gurgaon are based out of \\"Our Montessori House\\"- a montessori house of children based in Gurgaon, following the principals as laid down by Dr Montessori. Indian Montessori Association (IMA) Indian Montessori Association was created to support the students of IIMS, since they set up the first set of primary Montessori schools in India after Montessori's time. Details of this association can be seen in the link provided.  Indian Montessori Foundation (IMF)  The Indian Montessori Foundation is a pan- Indian organisation established to promote Montessori education in India. Their aim is to: * Expand the awareness of Montessori philosophy in society * Nurture Montessori principles in schools * Promote research and development of all aspects of Montessori education * Support AMI Montessori training * Support and bring together the AMI Alumni IMF is an affiliate of the Association Montessori Internationale (AMI) which has its headquarters in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. In 1929, Montessori established the Association Montessori International (AMI) to carry forward her humanistic social vision. AMI today, is a leading world body carrying forward Montessori's work in the spirit in which it was conceived. Headquartered in Amsterdam in Montessori's final home, AMI directs training programmes all over the world. AMI is affiliated to the United Nations through UNESCO and strives to further the rights of the child in society. IMF carries out awareness programmes and arranges events to support the AMI Montessori training and local schools. Responses from other organisations, including the government Since the time of Montessori, many institutions have come to realise the value of her principles. Concepts like ‚Äòchild-centric‚Äô, ‚Äòactivity based‚Äô and ‚Äòdiscovery based‚Äô methods have come into vogue with many educational institutions, both NGO run and Governmental. However, there has been a notable spurt of growth and development in the Montessori sphere in India.

It was the \\"biggest bloodbath in Namibian criminal history\\". Massacre and subsequent arrests On 5 March 2005 brothers Sylvester and Gavin Beukes killed eight people at the Kareeboomvloer farm: the owners, an employee and his pregnant wife, two adult members of the employee's family, and two small children. All people present on the farm on the day of the crime were killed. The attackers first shot and killed the owners Justus and Elzab√© Erasmus and then executed all witnesses by first firing at them and then setting five of them alight with diesel fuel. Four of the victims were still alive when they were set on fire. The Beukes brothers then stole the farm pickup car, loaded it with rifles and goats from the farm, and hid the loot at Stoney Neidel's house in Rehoboth and on his farm Areb, situated west of Rehoboth. Gavin Beukes, Sylvester Beukes and Stoney Neidel were arrested a few days after the massacre. Sylvester Beukes admitted guilt on all counts of murder but 10 days after the murder claimed that the owners' son, Justus Christiaan \\"Shorty\\" Erasmus gave the order to kill his parents, handed a weapon and ammunition to Sylvester, and promised N$50,000 payment, as well as legal representation. Erasmus denied these accusations but was also arrested. He and Neidel were later released on bail, while the Beukes brothers remained in custody throughout the trial. Trial The proceedings were conducted in the High Court in Windhoek and lasted for over four years. The three defendants were each represented by Windhoek defense lawyers, Sylvester Beukes by Titus Lipumbu of Titus Lipumbu Legal Practitioners, Gavin Beukes by Titus Mbaeva of Mbaeva & Associates, and Boris Isaacks of Isaacks & Benz Inc represented Neidel. According to testimonies, Sylvester Beukes killed all eight people by himself whereas his brother Gavin was a bystander who was, in his own words, \\"at the wrong place at the wrong time\\". Sylvester Beukes claimed that he tied his brother Gavin to a pole so that he could only have heard, but not observed, the shooting. Forensic evidence showed, however, that Gavin Beukes was no further than away when the victims were shot. Prior to sentencing, Acting Prison Commissioner Raphael Hamunyela was called as witness to explain how life sentences are administered in Namibia. All life sentences in Namibia can be set aside after as little as ten years, and the nature and severity of the committed crimes are not factors weighed by the prison authorities in considerations of early release. Multiple life terms count as one. For the sentences in the Kareeboomvloer mass murder case the Deputy Prosecutor therefore specifically asked not to impose a sentence of life imprisonment but to set definite periods. Judge President Petrus Damaseb followed the prosecution's request and handed out some of the longest prison terms in Namibian history. The Beukes brothers were sentenced to a combined total of 670 years in jail. Several concurrent sentences led to an effective prison term of 105 years for Sylvester Beukes, and 84 years for Gavin Beukes. Damaseb remarked about the case: > \\"[Y]ou tortured your victims and committed crimes the likes of which I hope > I will not [again] have the misfortune to preside over during the remainder > of my judicial career. [...] You truly are an embodiment of evil.\\" The likely motive for the killings was revenge with respect to the farm owners, and doing away with witnesses. Justus Erasmus had previously fired Sylvester Beukes, and laid theft charges against him. Beukes emerged from the Kalkrand police station in December 2004, three months prior to the massacre, where he was in custody for the charges brought by Erasmus. The claim that Beukes was contracted by the farmer's son was dismissed by the judge as not proven beyond reasonable doubt. Sylvester Beukes' testimony contained a number of contradictions and unlikely claims, most prominently that Shorty Erasmus had offered to pay for his legal representation in the murder case‚Äîpaying for the defense of his parents' murderer would inevitably have implicated him. Shorty Erasmus was thus acquitted of having contracted the murders. Stoney Neidel was found guilty of theft and illegal possession of firearms and sentenced to an effective six years of imprisonment.

It forms together with the Cologne Opera and other houses the stages of the city Cologne. The listed building has 830 seats in the Grand House, 120 in the locksmith and 60 in the refreshment room. In addition, the listed 'Halle Kalk' has 200 seats, it was used until closing in the summer of 2015 because of the danger of collapse. Since the 2013/14 season (September 2013) Depot 1 and Depot 2 have been used as interim venues during the extensive renovation of the Schauspielhaus on the site of the former Carlswerk in Schanzenstra√üe in Cologne-M√ºlheim. Ernst Hardt was the intendant before he moved on to the Westdeutscher Rundfunk in 1927. History The history of the Cologne theater begins in the Middle Ages. The first house was built in 1782, which was later called \\"Kom√∂dienstra√üe\\". A successor building from 1829 was destroyed in 1869 in a fire. In 1872, a new house was built in the Glockengasse (an historic street). In May 1898, a new theatre building on Habsburgerring was built. Based on a design by architect Carl Moritz,Thorsten Leiendecker and Nadine Leiendecker a neo-baroque building with restaurant and garden terrace was built. The 1902 finished building had 1800 seats and eventually cost 3.9 million marks. Cologne theater then had two large stages, which initially operated as \\"United City Theater\\", from the season 1906/07 as Opera House and Schauspielhaus, but were temporarily held together. In the new theater operas in particular, in the \\"old\\" house in the Glockengasse theater and operetta were performed. Both houses were run by Julius Hofmann, the then director of the Schauspielhaus. 1920 to 1945 Acting director Gustav Hartung engaged well-known Berlin actors such as Heinrich George to the theatre in the 1920s, which made the house known nationwide. In 1929, Bertolt Brecht's Threepenny Opera was scheduled to be performed in the Schauspielhaus. However, the conservative Center Party tried to stop this. Konrad Adenauer, the mayor Cologne intervened and the play was performed. At the time of the Nazi rule , the National Socialist opera director Alexander Spring was the general manager of the K√∂lner B√ºhnen and head of the Schauspielhaus. During the war, the two houses in the Glockengasse and the Habsburger Ring were destroyed or severely damaged. The theatre was heavily destroyed in a bombing raid in August 1943.Werner Jung: Das neuzeitliche K√∂ln 1794‚Äì1914. Von der Franzosenzeit bis zum Ersten Weltkrieg. J.P. Bachem, K√∂ln 2004, , Seite 215. (in German) In August 1945, the theater was able to give performances in replacement venues such as the auditorium of the university as the first theater in the British occupation zone again. In addition, a hall in the Rautenstrauch-Joest Museum in Ubierring was expanded to \\"Kammerspielen\\" and used until 1994 accordingly. The 1902 theatre ruins were demolished in 1958. New building on the Offenbachplatz thumb The new building opened on 14 October 1956, it opened with a gala performance of Paul Hindemith's opera Mathis der Maler. In 1957, the stages moved from their makeshift venue in the auditorium to a newly built so-called multi-storey building on , where opera and operetta, ballet and drama were performed. In 1962, the new Schauspielhaus, designed by Wilhelm Riphahn, was completed and opened with Schiller's Die R√§uber in the staging of the later director Oscar Fritz Schuh with actor Klausj√ºrgen Wussow as Karl Moor. Federal President Heinrich L√ºbke also attended this performance. In 1968, Hansg√ºnther Heyme became the artistic director and dramaturge of the Schauspielhaus, which caused controversy with his unconventional implementations of plays. He also began a close collaboration with classical philologist Wolfgang Schadewaldt, whose translations of Greek dramas he brought to the stage in Cologne. Heyme was replaced in 1979 by J√ºrgen Flimm, and then in 1985 by Klaus Pierwo√ü. In 1989, Pierwo√ü was the first director, who brought the East German director Frank Castorf with a production of Hamlet to a West German theater. It was followed by the directors Torsten Fischer in 1990, G√ºnter Kr√§mer, Marc G√ºnther and since 2007, Karin Beier. On 11 January 2013, Beier left before her move to the Deutsches Schauspielhaus, with her last production of an antique drama, The Trojan Women by Euripides. It was based on the work of Jean-Paul Sartre. Current theatre As part of the opera renovation, the Schauspielhaus was again demolished and rebuilt between 2010 and 2013. Having withdrawn for reasons of cost of the new version so much that they hardly seemed to pay off, urged the citizens' initiative \\"Courage to culture. Contents in front of the facade \\"preserved the listed building and carried out a referendum, which was approved in April 2010 by the city council of Cologne. In June 2012, EXPO XXI was put into operation in the Agnesviertel on the Gladbacher Wall as an interim play stage during the renovation work. An information box, which was erected in October 2012, provided information about its building progress. Rita Thiele has been chief dramatist and deputy director of the intendant and Patrick Wasserbauer is the managing director. Stefan Bachmann was appointed as Director of the House on 1 September 2013. Other current theatre directors include, Angela Richter, Rafael Sanchez and Moritz Sostmann.

Scandinavian art refers to a subset of Nordic art and is art specific for the Scandinavian countries Denmark, Sweden and Norway. Norse art, the art of the Vikings, is a form of Nordic art from a particular period of time. History Prehistoric Viking age Viking Age art is a term for the art of Scandinavia and Viking settlements elsewhere, especially in the British Isles, during the Viking Age. It has many elements in common with Celtic art, Romanesque art and East-European (Eurasian). The Vikings were active in the Nordic countries between the late Early Middle Ages and the early portion of the High Middle Ages. There are three main artistic styles from that period: Jelling style, Ringerike style, and Urnes style. Jelling is named after a Danish royal grave in Jutland and usually involves heavy animal designs. The Ringerike style includes foliage ornaments and interlacing. The style is named after the district in Norway where examples of Ringerike exist in local sandstone. The Ringerike style can also be seen in English manuscripts, and there are also some carvings in ivory which are done in this style. The Urnes style is named after the detailed designs on the carved doors of Urnes Stave Church in the Sognefjord. The style has influenced English Christian art. The main symbol of the Viking Age is the Viking ship. Not only was it used as a war and trade vessel, it demonstrated true individual design and art. An example of this comes from a ship burial in Norway, near the sea at Oseberg. Over 70 feet long, it held the remains of two women and many precious objects that were probably removed by robbers early before discovery. The head is 5 inches high and dates back to 834. It is currently located at the Viking Ship Museum, Bygd√∏y. The head of the ship represents a roaring beast with surface ornamentation in the form of interwoven animals that twist and turn as they are gripping and snapping.Kleiner, Gardner's Art Through The Ages: The Western Perspective, Volume I, 288. During the 11th century many Scandinavians became Christian. However, their abstract art persisted. The decoration of the wooden portal of the stave church located in Urnes, Norway is abstractly made up of animal forms that tightly intertwine with flexible plant stalks following a spiral rhythm. This is one of the few remains left from this time which were later incorporated in the walls of a 12th-century church. During this time while the abstract and animal motifs were spreading in art, the northern Europe Christian missionaries were building monasteries and sponsoring art with Christian content which was very different from art created before. Post Renaissance =Danish= Danish art goes back thousands of years with significant artifacts from the 2nd millennium BC, such as the Trundholm sun chariot. Art from modern Denmark forms part of the art of the Nordic Bronze Age, and then Norse and Viking art. Danish medieval painting is almost entirely known from church frescoes such as those from the 16th-century artist known as the Elmelunde Master. =Finnish= Finland artists have made major contributions to handicrafts and Industrial design. Famous Finnish artists and sculptors include W√§in√∂ Aaltonen, Eliel Saarinen, Eero Saarinen and Alvar Aalto. =Icelandic= The artwork Mother Earth at the Vatnsfell Hydropower plant in Iceland (2005) Icelandic art has been built on northern European traditions of the nineteenth century, but developed in distinct directions in the twentieth century, influenced in particular by the unique Icelandic landscape as well as by Icelandic mythology and culture. =Norwegian= Norwegian art came into its own in the 19th century, especially with the early landscape painters. Until that time, the art scene in Norway had been dominated by imports from Germany and Holland and by the influence of Danish rule. Initially with landscape art, later with Impressionism and Realism. One of Norway's most well-known artists is Edvard Munch (1863‚Äì1944). =Swedish= Anders Zorn, Self-portrait (1882) Carl Larsson, Flowers on the windowsill (1894) Among famous Swedish artists are Johan Tobias Sergel (1740‚Äì1814), Carl Larsson (1853‚Äì1919), Anders Zorn (1860‚Äì1920), Carl Eldh (1873‚Äì1954) and Carl Milles (1875‚Äì1955).

It houses mostly performances of operas, but also plays, run by the municipal Wuppertaler B√ºhnen. The house is also the venue for dance performances by the company created by Pina Bausch. The house was built in 1905 on a design by Carl Moritz as the (\\"Barmen Municipal Theatre\\"). It was rebuilt after being severely damaged during World War II, and again restored over the period 2006-2009.

History  The original building was the (\\"Barmen Municipal Theatre\\"), an all-purpose theatre for opera and plays built in 1905 before Barmen was merged into Wuppertal. It was designed by the architect Carl Moritz in a style drawing on neo-Baroque and Jugendstil. It was completed in 1907. The theatre was severely damaged during a World War II air raid on the night of 30 May 1943, which destroyed the hall completely and also damaged the stage area. It was rebuilt from 1954 to 1956, but with restricted Jugendstil elements which the leader of the project termed \\"schwerverdauliche Formensprache\\" (a language of forms hard to digest). The house reopened on 14 October 1956, one of the first war-damaged theatres in Germany to resume operations, with a gala performance of Paul Hindemith's .

Miles was a New Zealand entrant into the Australian Royal Military College, Duntroon, from which he graduated in 1914. He served as an artillery officer in the First World War and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his actions during the Spring Offensive. He remained in the military after the war, holding artillery commands for the next several years. When the Second World War broke out, Miles was the Quartermaster General of the New Zealand Military Forces. In 1940, he was seconded to the 2nd New Zealand Division as its commander of artillery. He saw action during the Battle of Greece and later during Operation Crusader in North Africa. Captured during fighting near Tobruk in late 1941, he was held in a prisoner of war camp in Italy but escaped in April 1943 with five other officers, including fellow New Zealander James Hargest. By October, Miles had made his way to Spain where, overcome with depression, he committed suicide. Early life Reginald Miles was born in Springston, near Christchurch, on 10 December 1892 to William and Mary Miles, who were farmers. Educated at Rangiora High School, he was commissioned in the school cadets in 1910. He was one of the limited number of officer cadets from New Zealand who, in 1911, enrolled in the Royal Military College in Duntroon, Australia, as part of the college's first intake following its establishment. First World War A highly rated student, Miles was in the final year of his cadetship at Duntroon when the First World War broke out. He immediately volunteered for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) and was posted to the Canterbury Infantry Battalion. He took ill before the NZEF left New Zealand for the Middle East and was discharged. On recovery, he re-enlisted in the NZEF and this time was posted to a howitzer battery in the New Zealand Field Artillery. He embarked for Egypt in December 1914 with a draft of reinforcements for the NZEF. He held the rank of captain during the Gallipoli Campaign and was badly wounded in July 1915. After he recovered, he returned to the front shortly before the evacuation from Gallipoli in December 1915. He was briefly the adjutant of 1st Field Artillery Brigade but later transferred to 15th Battery. He served on the Western Front with this unit and participated in the Battle of the Somme. As a result of his gallantry in action he was awarded the Military Cross in December 1916. In May 1917 he was promoted to major and appointed commander of a howitzer battery. In July 1918, Miles was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), having originally been recommended for the Victoria Cross, for his actions during the German Spring Offensive. His battery had come under threat from an advance by the enemy. He rounded up nearby infantry to reinforce his position, which had nearly exhausted its ammunition, and manned a fire trench. He then undertook a reconnaissance ahead of his position but was wounded by sniper fire. The citation for the DSO read: After recuperating from his wounds, Miles returned to active service in July as brigade major of the Field Artillery of the New Zealand Division. He was mentioned in despatches in November 1918. Interwar period After his return to New Zealand, Miles served as commander of Wellington Harbour's defences. In 1924 he was posted to England to attend Staff College, Camberley, after which he undertook specialist artillery courses. He returned to New Zealand in 1926 and, after serving at Army Headquarters in Wellington, was posted to Auckland to command artillery units. While in Auckland, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. In 1937, he was promoted to colonel and appointed commander of the Northern Military District. The following year he was sent to England to attend the Imperial Defence College. He was then attached to the War Office for three months before returning to New Zealand in 1939. In September 1939, he was appointed Quartermaster General of the New Zealand Military Forces. Second World War Brigadier Reginald Miles (left front, with arm band), Harold Barrowclough (centre) and Graham Parkinson (2nd right) await a medal ceremony, Maadi, Egypt. Major General Bernard Freyberg is at the extreme left. In January 1940, Miles was promoted to brigadier and seconded to the newly raised 2nd New Zealand Division as its commander, Royal Artillery. His command consisted of three field regiments, one for each brigade of the division, as well as an anti-tank regiment. In March 1940, he was dispatched to Egypt, where the first elements of the division had arrived, but was then sent to England, where he would spend the rest of the year. Here he commanded a portion of the division that had been diverted there while in transit. An initial attempt to join the main part of the division in the Middle East in October 1940 was foiled when the ship he was travelling on was bombed and forced to return to England. Greece Miles served throughout the Greece campaign and played a key role in the organisation of the withdrawal of the division as it retreated ahead of the advancing Germans. His artillery allowed the New Zealand infantry to defend against attacks in daylight and then withdraw at night. The artillery was particularly vital in covering the undefended high ground on the flanks of 6th Infantry Brigade as it manned a holding position at Thermopylae. Miles was mentioned in despatches for his work during this period. and was also awarded the Greek Cross of Valour. He briefly took command of all New Zealand forces on Crete, to where the bulk of the division had been evacuated from Greece, but after a few days went on to Egypt and missed the subsequent Battle of Crete. Some of his artillery units had also left Crete, albeit without much of their equipment, prior to the fighting. North Africa After convalescing, Miles re-joined the 2nd New Zealand Division in North Africa, where it was reforming after the losses incurred in Greece and on Crete. He then participated in Operation Crusader. During this campaign, aimed at lifting the besieged port of Tobruk, the 2nd New Zealand Division was involved in heavy fighting around Sidi Rezegh, where Miles deployed artillery in support of the 6th Infantry Brigade. Having established a corridor to Tobruk, the commander of the division, Major General Bernard Freyberg, was becoming concerned that they would be unable to hold it open. On 30 November, he entrusted Miles with getting permission from Lieutenant General Alfred Godwin-Austen, the corps commander, to withdraw into or alongside Tobruk. Tentative permission was granted but only if Sidi Rezegh could not be held. However, the same day the 6th Brigade was overrun by elements of the 15th Panzer Division. Miles advised Freyberg, still unaware of the fate of 6th Brigade due to poor communications, of Godwin-Austen's instructions on his return to the 2nd New Zealand Division's headquarters early on 1 December. Later that day, the 6th Field Regiment was overrun by German forces advancing to Belhamed. Miles, concerned about his artillery given the uncertainty surrounding the status of the 6th Brigade, was present on an inspection of the battle zone and he moved about, rifle in hand, encouraging his men, and directing them to fire their guns over open sights. Eventually, he was wounded and taken prisoner. This action was the most costly day of the war for the divisional artillery, with 275 casualties, including 96 prisoners of war, Miles among them. Prisoner of War Together with Brigadier James Hargest, the commander of the New Zealand 5th Infantry Brigade and captured around the same time, Miles arrived in the Italian prisoner-of- war camp Vincigliata PG 12 in 1942. The camp was a medieval castle near Florence, where he found himself amongst other captured high-ranking personnel such as Lieutenant General Sir Philip Neame, General Sir Richard O'Connor and Air Marshal Owen Tudor Boyd. Miles settled into camp routine and became a gardener, and was actively involved in escape attempts. Together with Hargest, he escaped through a tunnel that he helped to build and made his way to Switzerland in April 1943. Neame received a coded letter announcing their success a fortnight later. Miles was one of only three men (Hargest was one of the others) known to British Military Intelligence to have escaped from an Italian prisoner-of-war camp and make their way to another country prior to the armistice with Italy. In Switzerland, Miles and Hargest split up and travelled independently. As Hargest wrote in his book Farewell Campo 12, \\"I was over in Lucerne when Miles rang up to say he was off, and to suggest I should follow him later\\". Having travelled as far as the Spanish frontier on 20 October 1943, exhausted and depressed, Miles shot himself. He was buried with military honours, and escorted to his final resting place in the Figueras Municipal Cemetery by members of the British Consulate and a party of Spanish officers. Shortly before his death, his appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire was confirmed. Miles was posthumously awarded a bar to his DSO for his efforts in escaping from Italy. The citation for the bar, published in the New Zealand Gazette on 21 September 1944, read: Legacy Miles was survived by his four daughters from his marriage to Aim√©e Zita Donnelly, whom he had married in Egypt in 1916, and his second wife, Rosalind Georgette Bisset-Smith, whom he had wed in 1940 following the death of his first wife a few years previously. His second marriage did not result in any children. His only son was a lieutenant in the Fleet Air Arm; he also served in the Second World War and was killed travelling aboard HMS Glorious when the ship was attacked and sunk by the German battleships and off Norway on 8 June 1940. Medals Miles' medals were held by the family, who had managed to collect them after some had been lost. On 13 August 2009, they were donated to the National Army Museum at Waiouru, New Zealand, in a presentation ceremony attended by the New Zealand Chief of Army, Major General Rhys Jones.

Since 2015, producer Nico Hofmann has been the director. History The festival was established during the Third Reich in 1937. Between 1937 and 1939 the repertoire was based exclusively on Christian Friedrich Hebbel's 1861 three-part drama Die Nibelungen. The festival was revived in 1956 was without lasting success.

Sculptures Portuguese sculptures can be best analysed by studying the many tombs of the 12th and 13th Centuries that are found throughout Portugal. In the late 1700s, the colony of Brazil was the main influence in Portuguese sculpture. This can be seen by the increase in Baroque wooden sculptures during this time. Joaquim Machado de Castro, a famous Portuguese artist who lived around this time, is responsible for a lot of these works.Portugal-Live.net Painting The Last Supper, Gr√£o Vasco The Classical and Romantic styles of painting, brought to Portugal from Italy and France, had an influence on Portuguese artist Machado de Castro in the late 18th century and Ant√≥nio Soares dos Reis in the 19th century. A school for amateur painters, led by Nuno Gon√ßalves, was popular in the 15th century. As a result, Flemish artists added to the native style by decorating palaces and convents using their own techniques. The result gave Portugal a rich heritage of religious art. The Romantic Period in the 19th century sparked a rebirth of national art. This was followed by an era of naturalist realism, which in turn was followed by experimentation the 20th century. Contemporary artists Many Portuguese contemporary artists have made their mark on the world stage. Maria Helena Vieira de Silva was a famous Portuguese abstract painter and Carlos Botelho was known for his street scenes of Lisbon. Paula Rego is known for her \\"storytelling\\" in painting. She became famous for her works \\"Dog Woman\\" (1990's), and \\"Abortion\\", a reaction to the referendum in Portugal which made abortion a crime (late 1990s). Her art has been shown in museums such as Tate Modern in London and Casa das Hist√≥rias Paula Rego, in Cascais (dedicated solely to her art). Azulejos The Portuguese glazed tiles (azulejos) are one of Portugal's best decorative arts. Many 16th and 17th century buildings are lined with tiles, and the rooms and halls of palaces and mansions have tilted panels following a colour motif. Some prime examples of this style of art are the P√°tio da Carranca (courtyard of Carranca) of the Pa√ßo de Sintra (Palace of Sintra), the S√£o Roque church in Lisbon and the Quinta da Bacalhoa at Vila Fresca de Azeit√£o near Set√∫bal.

It has taken place in a replica of the Globe Theater on the grounds of the Neuss racecourse since 1991.  Globe Neuss  Globe Theater Neuss In 1988, a replica of the original London Globe Theater was built for the Landesgartenschau (horticultural show of the state NRW) in Rheda-Wiedenbr√ºck. Reinhard Schiele, a theater-maker who, at the time, worked with the Schlosstheater Overhagen, had the initial idea and supervised the entire project. Schiele wanted it to be as true as possible to the original, so he planned a mobile travelling theatre built entirely out of wood. This dream had to be abandoned due to fire prevention regulations. The result was a dodecagonal theatre building made of a wood-and-steel construction that was no longer mobile. After the horticultural show ended, the theatre was not used for two years. The city of Neuss and the ‚Ä≥Neusser Gemeinn√ºtzige Bauverein AG‚Ä≥ then acquired the building and rebuilt it on the grounds of the Neusser Galopprennbahn (racecourse) in 1991. The multi-storey building, whose small windows are closed with black and white shutters, can accommodate about 500 spectators sitting on several levels. Not one seat is further than 10 meters apart from the stage. In the historical Globe Theatre there was virtually no seating at all but this would be unthinkable for today's audiences.  Festival  The festival has been held annually since 1991. In 2016 it lasted for about a month during June and July joining theatres around the world in celebration of the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death. It is supervised by the cultural minister of the city of Neuss, as artistic director and production manager. The event is sponsored by a group called Friends of the Globe. The festival features an annually changing program of up to 30 performances attracting approximately 15,000 visitors. A space utilization of 90 percent is achieved.\\"'What else can you see in London and New Delhi?'

Sommerblut prides itself as an inclusive festival, in respect to its venues and cultural offerings. With a mix of own productions and guest performances, national and international artists, celebrities and young talents, Sommerblut has established itself in Colognes cultural landscape. Through its innovative and often experimental character as well as its diverse range of genres, Sommerblut has made a name for itself domestically and abroad.  Topics  Sommerblut doesn't shy away from socio-political issues and has a decisively emancipatory approach. Sommerblut also aspires to be a very inclusive festival, defining inclusion in the broadest possible way: physical and cognitive features, ways of life, cultural values, traditions, religious persuasions ‚Äì everything that defines the identity of a human being and the political discourse in society. Sommerblut raises awareness about the plight of minorities and other discriminated groups, like women, LGBT, chronically sick and handicapped people, refugees, people of color and those whose religious or ideological beliefs differ from the majority. ‚ÄûSommerblut draws the edge to the center of society and brings the center to the edge‚Äú, thats how the organizers describe their mission statement on their partly bilingual website. In 2019 Sommerblut stood under the topic of ‚ÄûFaith‚Äú, with own productions like \\"City of Faith\\" by Stefan Herrmann and Ensemble, \\"YOUTOPIA\\" and \\"Kraft und Beistand\\" ‚Äì a project with and for people with chronic illnesses. The reinterpretation of Shakespeares \\"Der Kaufmann von Venedig\\", the all-woman performance \\"Believe it - or not\\" and the first \\"Cologne Festival of Religions\\" also offered different takes on faith. In the preceding years Sommerblut chose the topics of \\"Body\\" (2018), \\"Intoxication\\" (2017) and \\"Love\\" (2016).

The Transeuropa organization was founded in 1993 to promote and maintain free and student theater at the European level. The festival is organized in cooperation with the University of Hildesheim and the Institute for Media and theater, and brings together young performers from the avant-garde theater scene of three or four European countries. The goal is to promote cultural and artistic cooperation through mutual understanding between people of different nationalities, ideologies and ways of life, and to detect new aesthetic and discursive developments in the independent theater scene. Transeuropa has become one of the largest of such festivals in Europe. History In the 1990s, after the opening of borders in Europe, Transeuropa explored links between East and West through the young theater scene in the partner countries.

History In 1981, Norbert Radermacher, created a programme for children's theater at the theatre education centre TPZ Lingen. Two years later, the TPZ organized a small local event called Kinder spielen und tanzen f√ºr Kinder (Children play and dance for children). Several years later, Radermacher ‚Äì by then the director of the TPZ ‚Äì developed the idea of creating an international theater festival for children, similar to the World Theatre Festival for adults.

French and Indian war When he was only 15 years old he joined Rogers' Rangers. Hackett saw more brutal combat before the age of 21 than many career soldiers saw in a lifetime.Thomas F. Kehr, \\"Requiem for James Hackett,\\" Naval History Vol. 25, No. 6 (December 2011): 59. In a small corps where promotion came hard, he earned the silver lace of a sergeant in John Stark's Company while still a teenager. He fought at the head of the British army as it pushed its way up Lake Champlain toward Canada. In 1758 he was one of two survivors of an 11-man patrol ambushed by an enemy war party numbering more than 50. A year later on August 27, 1759, Hackett himself was taken prisoner in the battle near St. John and remained a prisoner at Montreal until being released in a prisoner exchange on Nov 15, 1759. He continued to serve his company until Nov. 1, 1760, when it was disbanded. Living in Exeter, NH Hackett lived and owned property in Exeter, New Hampshire from 1760 to 1802. He spent a lot of his professional career working at Langdon‚Äôs Shipyard in Kittery ME / Portsmouth NH. Later in life he moved to Brookfield, New Hampshire and sold the Exeter property in 1802. Service in the Revolutionary War At the beginning of the American Revolution James Hackett participated in the raid at Fort William & Mary in New Castle, New Hampshire in December of 1774. Then as a Captain, he led a company of 108 men to Cambridge, Massachusetts, in April 1775 following the attacks on Lexington and Concord. On July 4, 1776, he was appointed Colonel in Wingate‚Äôs Regiment. He turned down command of a New Hampshire regiment in 1776 to ‚Äúfit out‚Äù armed vessels built in New Hampshire. In 1778, he volunteered for duty under General Sullivan in Rhode Island in a company raised by Colonel John Langdon in Portsmouth and was made lieutenant. He served as Colonel in the battle Saratoga with Langdon‚Äôs New Hampshire Independent Company. For his indispensable services, Hackett was given command of a battalion of artillery of three companies in Portsmouth. He had the honor of receiving General Washington with a ‚Äúgrand salute‚Äù at the occasion of his Excellency‚Äôs reception at Portsmouth on October 31, 1789.

The station is located on the Swiss Federal Railway's Z√ºrich to Olten main line and is also the terminus of the metre gauge Bremgarten‚ÄìDietikon railway (BD). The station is served by Z√ºrich S-Bahn lines S11, S12, S19, and S42; by some long distance trains on the main line; and by S-Bahn line S17 on the BD.  History  The first station on the site was built by the Swiss Northern Railway in 1847, as part of their pioneering line from Z√ºrich to Baden, and hence was one of the first railway stations in Switzerland. The original station building was constructed on the northern side of the railway line and still exists, albeit now used as a rail enthusiasts' club. The original station was replaced in the 1860s by a new building on the southern, city centre, side of the line. This in turn was replaced in the 1970s by the current large station building on the same side of the line.  Operation  The station has five through platforms on the main line, and two terminal platforms on the Bremgarten‚ÄìDietikon railway. Whilst the Bremgarten‚ÄìDietikon terminal platforms are alongside their main line equivalents, trains approach them via street running track through the centre of Dietikon and across the station frontage. Also in the station frontage is a large covered bus station, used by local and regional bus services. For most of the day, line S11 provides 2 train per hour (tph) to Z√ºrich and Wetzikon and 1 tph to Lenzburg and Aarau. Line S12 provides 2 tph to Z√ºrich and Winterthur and 2 tph to Baden and Brugg. Line S17 provides 2 tph to Wohlen, with an additional 2 tph as far as Bremgarten on weekdays only. Line S19 provides 2 tph to Z√ºrich and Effretikon, with some peak hour trains extended in the opposite direction to Koblenz. Additionally there is a single InterRegio train per hour between Zurich Airport and Basel SBB that calls at Dietikon in both directions.

A common technique is blow molding. Like any object made by extrusion, it is possible to produce multilayer plastic bottles. This is called coextrusion. The combination of different materials or colours can be used to produce flacons with different properties, such as: impermeability to light, oxygen, recycled inner layer.

Development  The developer, Haseko Corporation, bought the community's of land \\"in 1988 and sold its first homes a decade later.\\" The last of the Ocean Pointe community's 2,500 homes were completed in 2008, with development then progressing to Hoakalei. A golf course, designed by Ernie Els, opened at the adjacent Hoakalei Resort in 2009. A marina was under construction since 1997, and its plans were scaled back in November 2011 to a recreational lagoon. 1,800 homeowners filed a class-action lawsuit against Haseko in July 2013, claiming the developer's change in plans regarding the marina affected their property values. In September 2015, a jury ruled that Haseko must pay the plaintiffs millions of dollars in damages, including $1,300 per household (tripled to nearly $4,000 because of its being a consumer protection case); Haseko questioned authorization of the punitive damages award and said it planned to appeal the judgment. A month later, a circuit judge set aside the award, saying the applicable law didn't allow punitive damages, and citing a lack of evidence that homeowners had sustained damages. In January 2018, another circuit judge ruled that Haseko had to pay homeowners $20 million based on evidence that \\"the switch from the marina to the lagoon was an economic decision by Haseko to save money\\", and concurring that Haseko misled homebuyers. As before, Haseko plans to appeal the ruling. Safeway developed the Laulani Village Shopping Center on of land at the northeastern tip of the CDP. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on November 3, 2011. City Mill, a chain of Oahu hardware stores, co-anchors the shopping center. Petco also joined the development's opening on November 16, 2012, with Walgreens and Ross opening in the second quarter of 2013. Safeway's development affiliate, Property Development Centers, sold the shopping center in January 2014 for nearly $100 million to Terramar Retail Centers of San Diego. Construction of a replacement Ewa Beach Fire Station began in Ocean Pointe in late 2010 after a groundbreaking in October 2008; the project was built on of donated land at the northeast corner of Keoneula Boulevard and Kaileolea Drive and opened with a dedication ceremony on January 29, 2013.  Education  The Hawaii Department of Education operates the public schools; those within the CDP include Ewa Makai Middle School (2011), Keoneula Elementary School (2007), and Ewa Beach Elementary School (1959). Most of Ocean Pointe's neighborhoods are zoned to attend the newer elementary school. A local private school is the Seagull School at Ocean Pointe.

The regiment was raised in September 1914, and by December as part of the 1st Light Horse Brigade had moved overseas. The regiment only fought against the forces of the Ottoman Empire, in Egypt, at Gallipoli, on the Sinai Peninsula, and in Palestine and Jordan. After the armistice the regiment eventually returned to Australia in March 1919. For its role in the war the regiment was awarded nineteen battle honours. During the inter-war years, the regiment was re-raised as a part-time unit based in the state of South Australia. It was later converted to a reconnaissance squadron during the Second World War but was disbanded in early 1943 without having been deployed overseas. In the post war period, the regiment was re-raised as an amalgamated unit, designated the 3rd/9th Light Horse (South Australian Mounted Rifles), which is currently part of the Australian Army Reserve. Formation On 17 August 1914, the 3rd Light Horse Regiment was raised in Adelaide, South Australia and in Hobart, Tasmania. It had an establishment of twenty-five officers and 497 other ranks serving in three squadrons, each of six troops.Gullett 1941, p. 54. Each troop was divided into eight sections, of four men each. In action one man of each section, was nominated as a horse holder reducing the regiment's rifle strength by a quarter.Horner and Williams, Chapter: Setting up the Light Horse Once formed the regiment was assigned to the 1st Light Horse Brigade serving alongside the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Regiments. All Australian Light Horse regiments used cavalry unit designations, but were mounted infantry armed with rifles, not swords or lances,Gullett 1941, p. 29. and mounted exclusively on the Australian Waler horse.Gullett 1941, p. 38. Operational history 3rd Light Horse Regiment in front of Bethlehem Gallipoli In October 1914, the regiment left Australia, bound for the Middle East. After arriving in Egypt in December, they took part in the North African campaign defending the Suez Canal. They remained there until May 1915, when they left for the Gallipoli campaign with the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC). The regiment left their horses in Egypt, and arrived at the Gallipoli peninsula on 12 May 1915. Here regiment fought in the Landing at Anzac Cove, and the Battle of Sari Bair, but spent most of the campaign in a defensive posture. The regiment left Gallipoli for Egypt in December 1915, by which time they had earned four battle honours. Sinai and Palestine Campaign Two snipers from the 3rd Light Horse Regiment After its return to Egypt, the regiment ‚Äì along with the rest of the 1st Light Horse Brigade ‚Äì became part of the ANZAC Mounted Division, and was given responsibility for the defence of the Suez Canal from raiding Senussi Arabs. On 4 August 1916, they fought in the Battle of Romani, before being withdrawn to rest and refit. The regiment rejoined the brigade in November and took part in the battles of Maghaba and Rafa in December 1916 and January 1917. This was followed by defeat in the Second Battle of Gaza in April 1917, and then the successful Battle of Beersheba and the Third Battle of Gaza in October and November. The regiment followed up the retreating Ottoman forces and fought in the Battle of Mughar Ridge, the Battle of Nebi Samwill, the Battle of Jerusalam, the Battle of Jaffa, the capture of Jericho, the attack on Amman, the attack on Es Salt and finally, in September and October 1918, the Battles and Megiddo and Nablus. The Ottoman Empire signed the Armistice of Mudros on 30 October 1918, bring the war to an end. No longer required, the regiment sailed for Australia in March 1919 and subsequently disbanded. Their campaigns in the First World War cost them 158 men killed and 653 men wounded. Perpetuation In 1921, the decision was made to perpetuate the honours and traditions of the AIF by reorganising the units of the Citizens Force to replicate the numerical designations of their related AIF units.Grey 2008, p. 125. As a result, the 3rd Light Horse was re-raised as a part-time unit based in the 4th Military District,Finlayson 2012, p. 190. which encompassed the state of South Australia and part of New South Wales. Adopting the designation of the \\"South Australian Mounted Rifles\\", it assumed the lineage of several previously existing militia units, including the 22nd Light Horse (South Australian Mounted Rifles) that had been formed in 1912. This unit traced its lineage back to the 16th Australian Light Horse Regiment (South Australian Mounted Rifles), which had been formed in 1903 as part of the amalgamation of Australia's colonial forces into the Australian Army after Federation.Festberg 1972, p. 40. At the outbreak of the Second World War, the 3rd Light Horse was assigned to the 4th Cavalry Brigade, which was part of the 1st Cavalry Division. In December 1941, the regiment was re-organised as a reconnaissance company, adopting the designation of the 3rd Reconnaissance Company (South Australian Mounted Rifles). For a brief period in 1942, it assumed the designation of the 3rd Motor Regiment, although this was changed in May 1942 to the 3rd Reconnaissance Squadron.Festberg 1972, p. 41. In early 1943, as the Australian Army undertook a partial demobilisation, the unit was deemed surplus to requirements and was disbanded without having seen operational service during the war. In the post war period, the regiment was re-raised in 1948 equipped with armoured cars.Finlayson 2012, p. 313. It was initially designated the 3rd Reconnaissance Regiment (South Australian Mounted Rifles), but the following year it was amalgamated with the 9th Light Horse and re- designated the 3rd/9th Light Horse (South Australian Mounted Rifles).Festberg 1972, p. 15. The 3rd/9th remains part of the Australian Army Reserve and is currently part of the 2nd Division.

During the course of his training, he is being taught cycle patrolling in the streets when the head constable giving training comes out with certain startling revelations. This head constable gives an honest confession about his largely corrupt activities in the detection branch of Kotwali Police Station and how one incident changed his life, and which made him give up corruption and take to honesty. Overwhelmed in emotions, this IPS officer and his wife resolve not to earn bribes in the police as that would be an unforgivable sin - A Carnage by Angels!

It comprises a late 19th-century mansion-like homestead and surrounding grounds west of the village of Somers. Coolart is the remnant of one of the oldest grazing properties on the Mornington Peninsula. The homestead is set in a garden with adjacent wetlands and coastal woodlands with walking tracks. It is managed by Parks Victoria and the homestead is open to the public. The homestead features an exhibition of historic photographs, and hosts changing art exhibitions. Coolart is a popular venue for picnics, nature walks and birdwatching. Description 300x300px Coolart is bordered by Merricks Creek on the south, Somers School Camp on the east, Balnarring Beach road on the west and privately owned farmland on the north. It contains the Coolart Homestead, a substantial two-storey brick house, with a third-storey tower and several outbuildings. As well as a well-maintained garden there are several wetlands with a bird hide and a wetland observatory with educational facilities. There are also areas of woodland and farmland. The wetlands are home to a breeding colony of over 1000 Australian white ibises, while koalas, swamp wallabies, and echidnas inhabit the woodlands. History Coolart was originally part of the traditional lands of the Bunurong people, with the word \\"coolart\\" deriving from \\"colourt\\" or \\"kulluk\\", the Bunurong name for nearby Sandy Point. With European settlement of the area Coolart was taken up as a pastoral lease in 1839 by the Meyrick brothers. Subsequently, the property went through various farming phases, including cropping and raising sheep and cattle.Australian white ibises (Threskiornis molucca) on their nests at the Coolart breeding colony Interior of the Coolart Homestead The Coolart estate was purchased as a farming property in 1895 by Frederick Sheppard Grimwade, a Melbourne businessman and parliamentarian, with the homestead built immediately thereafter as his family's country retreat. The property passed through various hands during the early 20th century before it was acquired by Tom Luxton in 1937. Luxton persuaded the state government to declare the property a wildlife sanctuary and began a program of habitat development that included the construction of an artificial lake and other wetlands for waterbirds. When Luxton died in 1968 Coolart was purchased by the Victorian State Government for conservation and education purposes. Parks Victoria took over the management of the property in 1996, advised by the Coolart Wetlands and Homestead Trust. Coolart's land and buildings are listed on the Victorian Heritage Register.

Life Peter Brock was born in 1920 on Guernsey, Channel Islands. Although he came from a military family, he rejected this tradition. While studying at Exeter College, Oxford, he came under the influence of pacifist ideas, particularly those of Bart de Ligt.Harvey Dyck and Andrew Rossos. \\"Peter Brock (1920-2006)\\", Canadian Slavonic Papers, Vol. 49, No. 1/2 (March‚ÄìJune 2007), pp. 1-4 During the Second World War, he declared as a conscientious objector and was briefly imprisoned. He spent the rest of the war on alternative service, including working in a hospital. After the war, Brock worked with a Quaker relief mission to Germany and Poland, sparking his interest in Eastern Europe. After the mission ended, Brock took graduate study at Jagiellonian University, receiving a doctorate in history in 1950. Brock later emigrated to Canada and settled there, working at the University of Toronto from 1966. Brock's work on the study of peoples in Eastern Europe included detailed studies of the history and culture of the culture of the Poles, Czechs, and Ukrainians. Brock often learned the languages of the culture he was studying in order to read source material in these languages.John D. Stanley, \\"Peter Brock: An Appreciation,\\" Canadian Slavonic Papers 31 (June 1989): 105-106. Brock's studies on pacifism included a trilogy of books, Pacifism in the United States: From the Colonial Era to the First World War (1968), Pioneers of the Peaceable Kingdom (1970), and Twentieth-Century Pacifism (1970). The last book, appearing as the Vietnam War protests had revived public interest in pacifism, was \\"a critical and popular success\\".R.S. White, Pacifism and English Literature: Minstrels of Peace. Palgrave Macmillan, (p.76) By 1973, historian Robert Scharf said that \\"Professor Brock has become a recognised authority on pacifism in our Western civilization\\",Robert Scharf, \\"Pacifism in Europe to 1914 by Peter Brock (Book Review)\\", Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Vol. 407, (May, 1973), p. 210. while political scientist Martin Ceadel stated \\"[n]o ideology owes more to one academic than pacifism owes to Peter Brock. That the scope and richness of this historical tradition can now be recognized is largely the result of Brock's sympathetic and dedicated scholarship, which was begun when pacifism was an unfashionable subject.\\"Martin Ceadel, \\"Ten Distinctions for Peace Historians,\\" in The Pacifist Impulse in Historical Perspective, ed. by Harvey L.

The site originally was a necropolis, and in later constructions was a hospital for the poor and pilgrims, prison, student residence, stables, barracks and presbytery, eventually becoming a museum in 1891. It is housed in the former Saint-Raymond university college dating from the sixteenth century that borders Basilica of Saint-Sernin. The building has been renovated and reconstructed several times. It preserves and exhibits archaeological collections from protohistory to the early Middle Ages, mainly from the Celtic, Roman and early Christian periods, much from the Toulouse region. History of the building Originally a Christian necropolis dating from the 4th century was located here and stretched on either side of the Roman road close to the Basilica of Saint-Sernin. Between 1075-1080, on the site of the present building was a hospital for the poor and for pilgrims travelling the Way of St. James on the French Way from Arles via Toulouse, founded by Raymond Gayrard and financed by the Count of Toulouse. By the 13th century, at the time the University of Toulouse was created the house had been acquired by the inquisitor Bernard de Caux, who used it as a prison for heretics.1944 L'Auta - Coll√®ge Saint-Raymond - L'Auta January 1944 at Gallica p.10 In 1249 the inquisitor offered the house to the abbot of Saint-Sernin in gratitude for his services to the defence of the faith, specifying that the College of Saint-Raymond should be reserved for poor students, as recorded in a 1250 act. The college continued in that purpose until the French Revolution. After a great fire, at the end of the 13th century, Martin de Saint-Andr√©, bishop of Carcassonne, rebuilt on the same site. The current building, dating to 1523, was the work of the mason Louis Privat, who would later build the H√¥tel de Bernuy for a rich woad merchant, Jean de Bernuy. It was financed in part by Martin de Saint-Andr√© (fr), prior of the college and his father, Pierre de Saint-Andr√© (fr). The city of Toulouse bought the building in 1836 to use for a variety of functions, such as stables and barracks. In 1852-1853, during the redevelopment of the Place Saint-Sernin, it was the only building to escape demolition, due to the intervention of Alexandre Du M√®ge, Prosper M√©rim√©e and Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc. Between 1868-1871, it was restored by Eugene Viollet-le-Duc, who removed the remains of the demolished chapel and built a fourth corner turret, added two interior walls and numerous crenellated chimneys that accented the medieval appearance of the structure. Viollet-le-Duc also built a neo-gothic house in the old courtyard of the college, that became a garden. The building then served as a presbytery to the Saint-Sernin Basilica until 1890. It is one of the rare surviving examples of Toulouse university architecture from the late Middle Ages.

Presbyt√®re de St Sernin.jpg1880sÀê the presbytery of the Saint-Sernin Basilica became Saint-Raymond Museum in 1892 History of the museum By a municipal decree of 14 April 1891, the building became a \\"museum of ancient and exotic decorative arts\\" and was inaugurated on 24 April 1892 by Toulouse mayor Camille Ournac in the presence of Jean Jaur√®s, city councilor. It was dedicated for \\"small antiquities\\", small items (ethnographic objects, art objects, furniture, coins and medals and archaeological objects) from all periods. It thus served to unburden the Mus√©e des Augustins, that was still under renovation, of objects it was impossible to display there. The building was adapted to its new functions by the architect Arthur Romestin, when stairs, partitions and cupboards were altered to create larger exhibition spaces. Several additional windows were created to provide better light. The museum was thoroughly reorganized by a new curator, √âmile Cartailhac, who took over in 1912. In 1935 Henri Ramet (fr) named it the Cluny museum in Toulouse. The Society of Friends of the Saint-Raymond Museum and ancient art was founded in 1939. The museum was again rebuilt in 1946-1950 by Robert Mesuret, listed as a Monument historique on 11 August 1975 and its upper parts were restored in 1981-1982 to return them to their condition before the intervention of Viollet-le-Duc. In 1949, under the direction of Robert Mesuret, it became the archeological museum of Toulouse, receiving the collections of Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages of the city of Toulouse. Due to its age, between 1978 and 1982, a new rehabilitation project of the entire museum was launched under the direction of Yves Boiret, then chief architect of French Historic Monuments. The work began in 1981-82 with the refurbishment of the roof, that regained the appearance it had before the restoration by Viollet-Le-Duc and allowed the development of a second level below the roof. In the following years, among a lot of controversy, Boiret rehabilitates the nearby basilica of Saint Sernin. In 1980, the City of Toulouse acquired a neighboring building at 11 rue des Trois-Renards to relocate its offices, technical services and library, to provide and additional 2,500 m2 of exhibition space for the public. Between 1992 and 1994, a building was constructed in the Bourrassol district of Toulouse to house the reserve collections. A new redevelopment study was carried out under the direction of Bernard Voinchet, the chief architect of Historic Monuments in 1992, and in 1994 a complete reorganization was arranged by Dominique Baudis, Mayor of Toulouse. Between 1994 and 1996, archaeological excavations were undertaken to uncover the necropolis of Saint-Sernin, near the tomb of the martyred saint Saturnin, and his burials dating to the 4th century. A lime kiln dating from the 5th or 6th century was also discovered, and with about a hundred sepulchres and severals inscriptions viewable today. After more than four years renovation the museum reopened to the public on Saturday, 8 May 1999 having been restored to its original 1523 appearance, while a part of the ancient early Christian necropolis, dating from the fourth and fifth centuries, has been excavated.

The sculptures, discovered in the ancient Roman villa of Chiragan during the excavations conducted between 1826 and 1830 by Alexandre Du M√®ge, who became curator in 1832, were incorporated in the Museum of Antiquities arranged in the galleries of the cloister of the museum. The public can discover a remarkable ensemble along the Gallery of the Emperors and the Gallery of La Venus that can only be compared to the Louvre. Fenouillet Founded in 1831, the Archaeological Society of the Midi of France (fr) contributed to the enrichment of collections allowing the acquisition of major pieces for the collection, such as the torques of Fenouillet and portraits of B√©ziers, in addition to receiving other offerings or donations. In 1893 the museum gave up an important collection to the city for an annuity. Collectors have benefited from the enrichment of the museum with the donations of Antoine Bibent of objects from Pompeii, in 1831, the Count of Clarac donated Greek and Etruscan vases in 1843, Edward Barry gave small bronzes, and in 1862 the state deposited part of the Campana collection. Many other acquisitions were made in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The curator, Jules Fourcade acquired many pieces of ironwork from Toulouse and under the direction of Robert Mesuret, from 1961, after several movements of the collections, the museum mainly specialises in archeology and has become the Museum of Antiques of Toulouse. Excavations carried out by the Regional Service of Archeology (SRA) contributed greatly to the increase of the collections during the years 1980-1990. From prehistory to eleventh century For the protohistory, the museum has bracelets, fibulae and axes from the Bronze Age, and bracelets and leg rings in gold from Fenouillet and Lasgraisses for the Iron Age and more precisely from the time of the Volques Tectosages (fr). The rest of the Iron Age collections come from the Cluzel, Estarac and Vieille-Toulouse sites.

The museum has a very important Roman collection, with ornate oil lamps, sigillated vases from Montans and La Graufesenque, keys and figures of bonzes, mosaics from the end of the Roman Empire from Sigognac, Gran√©jouls, Saint-Rustice and Saint-Pierre-des-Cuisines, many epigraphs with a set of votive altars. The very rich collection of Roman busts were discovered partly in the ruins of the Roman villa at Chiragan in Martres-Tolosane, and partly in B√©ziers in 1844, which makes the museum's collection the second largest after the Louvre. The busts includes many emperors and their families but also, as yet unidentified, magistrates, soldiers, men, women and children. The discoveries of the villa Chiragan also cover reliefs of the Labours of Hercules, statues and busts of the Greco-Roman deities.

It based its Windows compatibility on the Wine API. The company later abandoned this approach in favor of attempting to make Linux applications easy to download, install and use. To this end a program named \\"CNR\\" was developed: based on Debian's Advanced Packaging Tool, it provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface and a slightly modified package system for an annual fee. The first public release of Lindows was version 1.0, released in late 2001. In 2002, Microsoft sued Lindows, Inc. claiming the name Lindows constituted an infringement of their Windows trademark. Microsoft's claims were rejected by the court, which asserted that Microsoft had used the term windows to describe graphical user interfaces before the Windows product was ever released, and that the windowing technique had already been implemented by Xerox and Apple Computer many years before. Microsoft sought a retrial and after this was postponed in February 2004, offered to settle the case. As part of the licensing settlement, Microsoft paid an estimated $20 million, and Lindows, Inc. transferred the Lindows trademark to Microsoft and changed its name to Linspire, Inc. On 15 June 2005, Michael Robertson stepped down as CEO of Linspire, Inc. He continues as chairman and was replaced as CEO by Kevin Carmony. Carmony resigned from Linspire on July 31, 2007. Linspire became a member of the Interop Vendor Alliance which was founded in 2006. On February 8, 2007, Linspire, Inc. and Canonical Ltd, the lead sponsor and developer of the Ubuntu operating system, announced plans for a new technology partnership, with Linspire aiming to \\"begin basing ... [their] desktop Linux offerings on Ubuntu.\\" On 13 June 2007, Linspire and Microsoft announced an interoperability collaboration agreement with a focus on document format compatibility, instant messaging, digital media, web search, and patent covenants for Linspire customers. This agreement has been criticised, most notably by the Groklaw website for being disingenuously short-lived and limited, and against the spirit of the GNU General Public License. Kevin Carmony, in one of the regular \\"Linspire Letters,\\" asserted that the agreement would \\"bring even more choices to desktop Linux users [and] ... offer a \\"better\\" Linux experience.\\" Linspire bases its product code names on fish found near its headquarters: Linspire/LindowsOS 4.5 was code named Coho; Linspire Five-0 (5.0 and 5.1) and Freespire 1.0, Marlin; and Freespire 2.0 and Linspire 6.0, Skipjack. CNR Linspire's CNR (originally Click'N'Run) was a software distribution service based on Debian's APT. It was designed to serve as a GUI-based, user- accessible means of downloading and installing various applications, both free and proprietary. The service allowed users to install available applications using a single click. CNR also included a set of Click and Buy (CNB) software, which included many commercial applications to members at a discounted rate. CNR had over 38,000 different software packages, ranging from simple applications to major commercial works such as Win4Lin and StarOffice. CNR was originally subscription-based with two tiers: basic service cost $20 annually, and gold, featuring discounts on some commercial applications, $50. In 2006, Linspire announced that the basic service was to be made available for free. Linspire planned to port CNR to the Ubuntu distribution. The company announced on April 24, 2006 that CNR would be released under an open source license. The release of the free CNR client was planned to coincide with the release of Freespire 2.0 and Linspire 6.0. On January 23, 2007, Linspire announced that it intended to provide CNR for other Linux distributions, both APT- and RPM- based, including Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE and Ubuntu. This support was expected to appear in mid-2007. On February 8, 2007, Linspire, Inc. announced a partnership with Canonical Ltd., publisher of the Ubuntu Linux distribution. This deal would see Linspire and Freespire migrate from the unpredictable Debian release process to the semiannual Ubuntu release cycle. It was intended that the main Ubuntu distribution would become the first recipient of the opening of the Click'N'Run service to Linux distributions besides Linspire. Freespire Freespire RC1 In August 2005, Andrew Betts released Freespire, a Live CD based on Linspire.Freespire's website Some users mistook this for a product from Linspire, Inc. Linspire, Inc. offered users a \\"free Linspire\\" (purchase price discounted to $0) by using the coupon code \\"Freespire\\" until September 9, 2005. On April 24, 2006, Linspire announced its own project named \\"Freespire\\". This followed the model of community-oriented releases by Red Hat and Novell in the form of Fedora and openSUSE. Freespire was a community- driven and -supported project tied to the commercial Linspire distribution, and included previously proprietary elements from Linspire, such as the CNR Client, while other elements, which Linspire, Inc. licenses but does not own, like the Windows Media Audio compatibility libraries, remain closed-source. Consequently, there are two versions of Freespire, one with the closed source libraries, and one, called Freespire OSS Edition, that includes only open- source components. Freespire 1.0 was released on August 7, 2006, three weeks ahead of schedule. It is now known that Freespire will change its code base from Ubuntu to Debian on any future releases. On July 10, 2007 Linspire released Linspire 6.0, based on Freespire 2.0. The final release of Freespire was 2.0.8, released on 30 November 2007. This was based on Ubuntu 7.04 which was supported for 18 months and reached end-of-life on 19 October 2008. Freespire therefore receives no security updates from upstream at present. The distribution is now considered \\"Discontinued\\" by DistroWatch. Contributions Linspire, Inc. sponsored open source projects including the Pidgin and Kopete instant messaging clients, the Mozilla Firefox web browser, the ReiserFS file system, the Nvu WYSIWYG website editor, and the KDE-Apps.org and KDE-Look.org websites.KDE-Apps.org and KDE-Look.org In the past, Linspire has hosted several Linux and open source events, such as the annual Desktop Linux Summit, DebConf and the KDE Developers Conference. Criticism Linspire has drawn some criticism from the linux free software community. This has included criticism for including proprietary software, with GNU founder Richard Stallman commenting: \\"No other GNU/Linux distribution has backslided so far away from freedom. Switching from MS Windows to Linspire does not bring you to freedom, it just gets you a different master.\\" In addition, following the initial Freespire announcement Pamela Jones of the Groklaw website published an article entitled \\"Freespire: A Linux Distro For When You Couldn't Care Less About Freedom;\\" that was highly critical of Linspire, Inc., and the Freespire project, for including closed-source components and advertising them as a favourable point--an action she classed as ignoring free and open-source software (FOSS) community values in a \\"community-driven\\" distribution, asserting that \\"Free Software isn't about proprietary drivers\\" and that \\"proprietary codecs, drivers and applications are not Open Source or open in any way.\\" In response, Linspire, Inc. CEO Kevin Carmony stated via a journalist on the Linspire website that in ten years of holding out, the FOSS community has made relatively few gains, that many users are already using proprietary software and, although some would hold out, most would prefer to have something that works rather than nothing. He also asserted that the company believed in open source software, but also in the freedom of individuals to choose whatever software they want.

Parts one and two of it were first published in the 1874 Nos. 7,8 and 10 of The Russian Messenger as part of a trilogy which also included Old Years in Plodomasovo (1869) and The Cathedral Clergy (1872). History The publication of the novel has led to Leskov's severing all ties with The Russian Messenger. The main issue was the magazine's editor-in-chief Mikhail Katkov's disagreement with the author's position as regards Russian dvoryanstvo. At the time of the publication Katkov (while praising the novel's artistic qualities)N. Leskov's letter to A. Suvorin, 11 February 1888. told the members of the magazine's stuff: \\"We've made a mistake, this is not our man, has nothing to do with us, [his departure is] not something to be pitied.\\"N. Leskov's letter to M. Protopopov, 23 December 1891. Outraged by editorial cuts, Leskov decided against starting upon the third part of the novel, leaving it unfinished. Leskov himself rated A Decayed Family higher than The Cathedral Clergy and The Sealed Angel, referring to it as his \\"most mature work\\".N. Leskov's letter to A. Suvorin, 2 March 1889. The publication in the magazine of parts 1 and 2 received high praise from Ivan Aksakov and Nikolay Pirogov. In 1875 A Decayed Family came out as a separate edition. \\"Here its second part is presented in my own version, not that of Katkov,\\" Leskov wrote in a letter to Ivan Aksakov on March 23, 1875. As The Complete Leskov started to be published by Alexey Suvorin's publishing house, A Decayed Family was included into the Volume 6, which also featured Leskov's most radical anti-clerical essays and stories. On July 16, 1889, Leskov received the news that the whole issue of Volume 6 had been arrested by the police, which led to his first major heart attack.

Life He was born at Dorchester in Dorset. He graduated B.A. from Brasenose College, Oxford, on 16 February 1595, and was elected Fellow of All Souls in 1599, proceeding M.A. on 5 April 1600, B.D. on 23 April 1607, and D.D. 26 June 1609. George Abbot, then bishop of London, presented him to the rectory of St Clement Eastcheap, on 29 December 1610, and to that of St Michael Crooked Lane, on 1 October 1611. He resigned St Clement before 9 December 1611, and St Michael before 17 June 1614. Mocket held the rectories of Newington, Oxfordshire, and of West Tarring, Sussex, from 1614, and of Monks Risborough, Buckinghamshire, from 1615 till his death. He was for some time domestic chaplain to Abbot, and one of the king's commissioners concerning ecclesiastical affairs. From March 1610 to June 1614 he was employed in licensing books for entry at Stationers' Hall. On 12 April 1614 he was elected Warden of All Souls' College, Oxford. Mocket died on 6 July 1618, and was buried in the chapel of All Souls'. A marble tablet with a Latin inscription was fixed to the south wall of the inner chapel (moved to the north wall of the outer chapel in 1664). Works Mocket is known for two works: for each of them there is some remaining mystery for scholars. God and the King The authorship of a tract, upholding the obligation of the oath of allegiance, and entitled God and the King (in Latin Deus et rex), has been ascribed to Mocket; Glenn Burgess comments in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography on the lack of firm evidence that he was the author. It remained an authoritative theological summary into the next century. The work was ‚ÄòImprinted by his Majesties special privilege and command,‚Äô in London in 1615, in both Latin and English; London, 1616, in Latin only; Edinburgh, 1617, in one or both languages; London, 1663; Edinburgh, 1725; London, 1727 (published by Nathaniel Booth). The book was commanded to be taught in all schools and universities, and by all ministers of the church, and to be purchased by all householders in England and Scotland. This command was enjoined by the privy council of Scotland in June 1616, and by the general assembly at Aberdeen in August 1616, and the work sold widely. It is a dialogue on political duties, intended for the young.J. P. Sommerville, Politics and Ideology in England 1603‚Äì1640 (1986), p. 12. The content is a mixture of history (an account of Catholic intrigues against James and Elizabeth I), and religious generalities, to justify the requirement of an oath of allegiance. It implies an account of the divine right of kings, but in religious rather than legal terms.Glenn Burgess, The Politics of the Ancient Constitution: An Introduction to English Political Thought, 1603‚Äì1642 (1993), p. 136. Theodidactus, who leads the dialogue, justifies the penal laws.W. B. Patterson, King James VI and I and the Reunion of Christendom (2000), p. 188; Google Books. A parody appeared by John Floyd, Latin original (1619) Deus et rex, and in English (1620) as God and the King. Or a dialogue wherein is treated of allegiance due to our most gracious Lord, King Iames, within his dominions. Doctrina et Politia In 1616, in London, Mocket published a volume in Latin, containing some works not previously translated from English. It comprised: # John Jewel's ‚ÄòApology,‚Äô # The Church Catechism, # Alexander Nowell's Catechism, # The Thirty-Nine Articles, # The Liturgy of the Church of England, and # The Book of Ordination of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons. To these he added a work of his own entitled Doctrina et Politia Ecclesi√¶ Anglican√¶, which was a general view of ecclesiastical jurisdiction in the English church, mainly prepared for the information of foreigners. The book offended the king, and by public edict was condemned and burnt in 1617. Thomas Fuller in his Church History considered that Mocket suffered on account of his patron Abbot, becoming unpopular with other bishops. Peter Heylyn in his Cyprianus Anglicus, while criticising Mocket's ignorance and Calvinism, was of opinion that the real offence was the omission of the first clause in the Latin text of the twentieth of the Thirty-Nine Articles, which runs: ‚ÄòThe Church hath power to decree rites or ceremonies, and authority in controversies of faith.‚Äô It was also said that Mocket's extracts from the homilies were made so as to support the views of Abbot, and that as a translator he had acted as a commentator; while James Montagu, bishop of Winchester, resented the order in which the bishoprics were enumerated. The 1616 edition of the Doctrina et Politia Ecclesi√¶ Anglican√¶ was reprinted in 1617. Mocket's work, without the rest of the volume, was republished in London in 1683, under the title, ‚ÄòTractatus de Politia Ecclesi√¶ Anglican√¶,‚Äô and with it was printed Richard Zouch's ‚ÄòDescriptio Juris et Judicii Ecclesiastici.‚Äô A third edition appeared in London in 1705. Modern scholars do not accept the explanations of Fuller and Heylyn at face value. Screech considered that the reasons given do not add up to enough to explain burning rather than revision.Michael Andrew Screech (editor), Doctrina et politia Ecclesiae Anglicanae: an Anglican summa: facsimile with variants of the text of 1617 (1995), p. xi; Google Books. Clegg puts the incident in the context of the divisive church politics of the Netherlands‚Äî‚Äìthe Calvinist-Arminian debate ahead of the Synod of Dort of 1618‚Äì9‚Äîand the tensions among bishops at court (agreeing in part with the direction of the comments in Fuller and Heylyn). On the assumption that Doctrina et Politia was directed at overseas Protestants, the rendering of Article 20 had the misfortune to contradict the King's policy for handling the Dutch Remonstrants, by weakening the case for a conciliar solution to the theological issues under dispute. Late in 1617 Sir Dudley Carleton reported to Thomas Lake the circulation of a Dutch book Weeg-schaal by Jacob Taurinus, contrasting King James's actions at the Hampton Court Conference to his advocacy of a council in the Netherlands. Clegg points out that the historical record of the burning is very slender; and argues that the likely reason is embarrassment to the king of this tactical kind.Cyndia Susan Clegg, Press Censorship in Jacobean England (2001), pp. 103‚Äì113; Google Books.

Overview A tidal bundle sequence can be seen as a variation in bed thickness with a periodicity of 14 days (diurnal) or 28 days (semidiurnal). During the neap tide, when the tidal current strength is weakest, smaller quantities of finer grains are deposited. As the tidal variation grows larger, towards the spring tide, larger quantities of coarser material will be deposited which results in an increasing bed thickness. Bed thickness will be greatest at the spring tide and then decreases as the tidal variation grows smaller, towards the neap tide again and the thinnest beds. Significance The presence of tidal bundles depends on the presence of spring and neap tides, which can only occur in three-body gravitational systems (the Earth, the Sun and the Moon). Therefore, the earliest time from which tidal bundles can be identified gives a conclusive lower bound on the age of the Moon.

Once the term of copyright protection has ended, the copyrighted work enters the public domain, and can be freely reproduced and incorporated into new works. In the United States, works published before are all in the public domain under the provisions of the Copyright Act of 1909 and previous law. This act provided for an initial term of 28 years. This term could be extended for an additional 28 years by registering copyright renewal with the United States Copyright Office. Works published before 1964 in the US are all in the public domain, excepting only those for which a renewal was registered with the US Copyright Office. Relatively few works from this era have had their copyrights renewed. A US Copyright Office study in 1961 found that fewer than 15% of registered copyrights had been renewed. While the copyrights for most movies were renewed, one important example of a film that entered the public domain because of non-renewal is It's a Wonderful Life, which was originally copyrighted in 1946 and entered the public domain in 1975 (however, the film as a whole is still subject to the copyright of its source material, which was properly renewed). No online access. The US Copyright Act of 1976 modified these provisions so that the second, renewed term was 47 years. This extension applied to works that had been copyrighted between 1950 and 1977 and were thus in their first 28-year term of copyright protection, as well as to new works copyrighted after 1977. The maximum term of copyright protection became 75 years instead of the 56 years of the 1909 law, and applied to works whose copyrights were renewed in 1978 or later. Copyright renewal has largely lost its significance for works copyrighted in the US in 1964 or after due to the Copyright Renewal Act of 1992. This law removed the requirement that a second term of copyright protection is contingent on a renewal registration. The effect was that any work copyrighted in the US in 1964 or after had a copyright term of 75 years, whether or not a formal copyright renewal was filed. There are some legal reasons for filing such renewal registrations. A further amendment to US copyright law in 1998 extended the total term of protection to 95 years, which now applies to all works copyrighted in 1964 or after. Determining whether a US copyright was renewed Copyright renewal is significant for works with US copyright notices from ‚Äì1963. All copyright registrations and renewal registrations are published by the Copyright Office in its Catalog of Copyright Entries. For works with copyright notices from 1950 onward, the catalog can be searched online for renewals using a website maintained by the Copyright Office; the corresponding renewals are from 1978‚Äì1991.

Short had an outstanding 2017‚Äì18 Big Bash League season, in which he scored 572 runs and was named the player of the tournament award. Personal life Short was born in Katherine, Northern Territory, but moved to Darwin at about the age of four. He is of Indigenous Australian descent through his maternal grandmother, whose ancestors are the Mitakoodi people of the Cloncurry River region in Queensland. Short's parents ran an indoor sports centre in Darwin and he grew up playing indoor cricket before progressing through the Darwin grade cricket leagues. At the age of 16 he commuted between Darwin and Adelaide to play in the South Australian Grade Cricket League. He later moved to Perth to have more opportunity to play at higher levels.https://www.playersvoice.com.au/darcy-short-story-of-mitakoodi-man Domestic career He made his List A cricket debut in November 2011 against New South Wales in the 2011‚Äì12 Ryobi One-Day Cup. He only scored 3 runs, but took two wickets with his left-arm unorthodox spin bowling, including one from the second delivery he bowled. In February 2010 Short made his debut for Western Australia in the Futures League after performing well for the Northern Territory in the Imparja Cup in 2009. He was also selected in an Indigenous Australian cricket team that toured England in June and July 2009. In March 2011 Short was named the Lord's Taverners Indigenous Cricketer of the Year award winner.

In June 2018, he along with Aaron Finch registered the highest ever opening partnership of 223 runs in a T20I match against Zimbabwe which was ended in the final over with Short managing to score only 46 runs off 42 balls while Finch went on to score a world record individual score of 172 off 76 balls. The partnership of 223 between Finch and Short is also the highest partnership for any wicket in a T20I and also marked the first ever instance of a 200+ runstand in a T20I match for any wicket. The partnership was also the second highest ever partnership for any wicket in any form of T20, just behind 229 runs set by Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers. Australia finally won the match by 100 runs, which is their biggest winning margin in T20Is. On 16 July 2020, Short was named in a 26-man preliminary squad of players to begin training ahead of a possible tour to England following the COVID-19 pandemic.

His printshop produced over 9,000 posters between 1872 and 1935, predominantly for artists, magicians and circus and vaudeville performers. First learning lithography at his father's shop in Hamburg, he received formal training in Berlin and returned to operate independently in 1872. First concentrating on labels for businesses, he turned to poster printing to cater to the many artists and performers which operated nearby to the location of his business. Friedl√§nder expanded his business to cover manuscript printing and established two magazines. The first was Der Kurier (\\"The Courier\\") which ran from 1890 to 1901, and then Der Anker (\\"The Anchor\\") which ran from 1902 to 1928. After his death, Friedl√§nder's sons, Otto Max and Ludwig took over operations. The business suffered greatly when World War I broke out because the entertainment industry, the printshop's lifeblood, came to a virtual standstill. Business picked up in the 1920s but in 1928 the Great Depression intervened. After the Nazi regime came into power in 1933, the business, run by a Jewish family but a \\"Devisenbringer,\\"‚Äîa company that brought in foreign currency‚Äîwas allowed to continue for a few more years but was finally shut down.  Life and work  1890 Friedl√§nder poster for a Carl Hagenbeck show 1895/1896 Friedl√§nder Poster: L√∂we auf Elefant (\\"Lion on elephant\\") 1905/1906 Friedl√§nder Poster: Dompteuse Miss Charles (\\"Lion Tamer Miss Charles\\"). The woman depicted is Ida Krone, the wife of circus director Friedl√§nder was the third and last son of Raphael Israel Friedl√§nder and Betty Friedl√§nder n√©e Wagner. Prior to moving to Hamburg, Friedl√§nder's father worked as a merchant. After the move however, Raphael joined a guild of professional lithographers and opened a small lithography shop. Friedl√§nder first received informal training at his father's shop and in the summer of 1865, went to Berlin for more formal instruction. By 1868, Friedl√§nder was apprenticed to top German lithographers. In 1872 Friedl√§nder returned to Hamburg and began working as an independent printmaker. On 1 April 1875 he married one Sarah Berling, also from Hamburg, under Jewish rites.Stephan Oettermann, Jan. J. Seinga: Adolph Friedl√§nder Lithos. Gerolzhofen 2002, S. 9 After his father died, Friedl√§nder inherited his old lithographic press and set up shop in the St. Pauli quarter of Hamburg. He initially concentrated on label printing for kolonialwaren and delikatesswaren (types of gourmet grocers). Friedl√§nder's shop was located nearby to the , an area of numerous beer halls, vaudeville theaters, music halls and other exhibition spaces. Deciding these presented a better business opportunity, he abandoned label printing and focused instead on selling posters to these businesses utilizing the complex four-color lithographic process he had learned in France. Friedl√§nder breakthrough moment came when he received large orders of posters advertising Carl Hagenbeck's animal shows in 1883 and 1884. To accommodate his growing business needs, in 1884 Friedl√§nder purchased a photolithographic press capable of making 600 prints per hour. In the following years he expanded his business and its machinery to include manuscript publishing capability. The addition necessitated a move to a larger space which transpired in 1887.Ruth Malhotra: Manege frei. Artisten- und Zirkusplakate von Adolph Friedl√§nder. Dortmund 1979, S. 7 In 1890, Friedl√§nder published the first issue of Der Kurier (\\"The Courier\\"), a magazine founded by his publishing house, which concerned matters of interest for showmen, traders, circus workers, vaudeville and stage performers, and related professions. In 1891 Der Kurier was run full-time by Adolf Fischl. In 1901 it was edited by Max Cohn but ceased publication that same year. The following year Friedl√§nder established, Der Anker (\\"The Anchor\\"). Billed as an international trade magazine for showmen and artists, it operated from 1902 to 1928. From the mid-1890s Friedl√§nder also printed postcards, a new medium that was in particularly high use by circus workers and artists. His main business was, however, poster printing. Starting in the early 1890s, Friedl√§nder printed approximately 100 different posters designs annually. By the turn of the century the number had doubled. Friedl√§nder died on 7 July 1904. According to his obituary appearing in the 9 July 1904 issue (No. 159) of the Hamburg Generalanzeiger (The Hamburg General Gazette), his death came about \\"nach langem schweren Leiden\\"Oettermann/Seffinga (2002), S. 15 (\\"after very severe suffering\\").  Friedl√§nder's press, 1904 to 1935  After his death, Friedl√§nder's sons, Ludwig Friedl√§nder (1877‚Äì1953) and Max Otto Friedl√§nder (1880‚Äì1953) took over his company's operations. When World War I broke out in 1914, the entertainment industry came to a virtual standstill, which had a concomitant effect on the need for the company's posters. Print volume rose in the 1920s, but then fell off sharply to a level of about 100 poster designs per year as a result of the Great Depression. In addition to working at the family business, Otto Max also managed the Flora Theater until 1934, at which time he traveled with the Sarrasani circus to South America. Finding little possibility of an existence there, he returned to Germany in 1935, only to be quickly sent to a concentration camp. Ludwig transitioned the company to use of modern offset printing, working with chief draftsman Wilhelm Eigener (1904‚Äì1982) who specialized in wildlife illustration. The traditional printer's mark of the company was a heart-shaped leaf with serrated edges, sometimes called a \\"Judenkirsche\\" (\\"Jews cherry\\"). Despite the Jewish origin of the company, as a \\"Devisenbringer\\"‚Äîa company that brought in foreign currency‚Äîthe print shop was tolerated for a time after the Nazi regime came into power in 1933. Friedl√§nder's press employed specialist artists for different types of posters, including Christian Bettels, considered one of the best animal draftsmen of his time. The company produced over 9,000 posters over its lifetime, catering almost exclusively to artists, magicians and circus and vaudeville performers. In 1935, the last poster designed by the Friedl√§nder company appeared with the production number 9,078.Oettermann/Seffinga (2002), S. 29‚Äì34  Reception  Friedl√§nder posters can be found in antiquarian shops, in private collections and in museums such as the Munich Stadtmuseum.G√ºnter Metken: Kunstreiter und Salonl√∂wen. In: Die Zeit, Nr. 5/1978 Since the late 1970s, his posters have drawn increasing attention, being featured in exhibitions and published works. Approximately 200 posters were published in 1979 by Ruth Malhotra. In 2002, Stephan Oettermann and Jan J. Seffinga created an index of Friedl√§nder posters containing detailed descriptions of the works and an extensive bibliography; in 2004 a fourth revised edition was issued. A Dutch private collection is available online.Plakate von Friedl√§nder aus der Sammlung Jaap Best Circusmuseum.nl Friedl√§nder's posters have been often reprinted and are available from many sources. Despite their recognizable provenance, not all Friedl√§nder poster designs displayed his printer's mark, nor the direct authorship note sometimes included: \\"Lith Adolph Friedl√§nder Hamburg\\". Accordingly, it is believed that there are still original designs in existence that are yet to be found.Siehe Katalog.

Plot Sang-hyun and Dong-hyun were born as conjoined twins with two heads sharing one body. Dong-hyun has the full control of their shared body, except his brother's head which is attached to the back of his. The two can never look at each other directly, as their heads always face the opposite direction. Dong- hyun looks \\"normal\\" as long as he wears his hoodie, which fully covers his brother's face. The two have lived nearly 30 years in a remote house with their father, who tells them not to go outside the property. However, things change when their father brings Seung-ah, a bubbly, good-hearted young artist, to the house to help Dong-hyun publish a children's book ‚Äï one of his lifelong dreams. Despite having the same body, the brothers share little else. While Sang-hyun is patient and generous, Dong-hyun is always questioning something and extremely selfish. Dong-hyun gradually builds a grudge against Sang-hyun, blaming him for his unhappiness and isolated life. Sang-hyun, who lets his brother do whatever he wants, does not recognize his own wants and needs until he gets to know Seung-ah. And things worsen as Dong-hyun, who wants to appear as a \\"normal writer\\" for his upcoming book, desperately tries hiding what he thinks as his ultimate flaw ‚Äï his own brother. Throughout the film, peaches appear frequently. Before the twins were born, their parents enjoyed a date near a peach tree. Near the same tree is where the young twins saw their mother for the last time, since she gradually lost her sanity and health after giving birth to them. The tree and its fruits are witness to Sang-hyun and Dong-hyun's history; it sees the twins' beginning, their loss, and their isolated dreams and experiences.

Loomis was a local homesteader and photographer who documented the 1915 eruptions of Lassen Peak, and was instrumental in the 1916 establishment of the national park. In 1929 Loomis donated the museum and of surrounding lands to the National Park Service, which since then has used the structure as an interpretational facility. Loomis had desired that the headquarters of the new park be established at Manzanita Lake, but an alternate site was chosen by the Park Service. Loomis and his wife Estella started building their own museum to exhibit photographs taken by Loomis and others, as well as geological exhibits and artifacts of local Native Americans. The building was dedicated on July 4, 1927 as the Mae Loomis Memorial Museum, named after their only child, Luisa Mae Loomis, who had died in 1920.  Description  The Loomis Museum is a one-story rectangular building built of local volcanic rock in cut-face random ashlar coursing. The main body of the museum is about by , with small extensions to either side at the rear, making the building T-shaped in plan. The building is characterized by its prominent crenelated stepped parapets. Contrasting with the rustic character of the stonework, the main entrance features formal sidelights and a fanlight. A small bracketed shed roof shelters the entrance, and the side elevations have similar shed projections down their length., all roofed with green tile. The interior is primarily composed of a single large room. About to the northeast of the museum stands a seismograph building of similar design, measuring about by . The station was built by the Loomises in 1926. It features three large windows that allow visitors to view the seismographic equipment within. Described in 1952 as \\"ugly quasi-Spanish\\", the Loomis Museum was briefly considered for demolition and replacement during the Mission 66 program.

Rebranding to Wamba  In July 2012, Mamba changed its name to Wamba in order to keep expanding into new markets with a unified name. In many countries the domain ‚Äúmamba‚Äù was already taken by Storck, a producer of chewy sweets, so ‚ÄúMamba‚Äù had to create a new brand for the international market. In Russia, Mamba and Wamba operate alongside one another. After the rebranding, the old site works ‚Äúlike a partner‚Äù of Wamba system. Before July 2012, Mamba was operating internationally as an independent project called Mamboo. Now Mamboo.com is part of Wamba system as well.  Background  The site was established in 2002, originally available only in Russia. In 2004 the number of active users reached 1 million with daily sign-ups at over 7,000. By 2005, the site was reporting an estimated 4-5 million users, with the FINAM Investment Company purchasing a controlling interest in the company, as its service was rolled out to Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Germany, the USA and Israel etc. In 2006, site strategy changed, with a new approach of consolidating its position in the market by process of partner acquisition and audience growth. According to the results in 2006‚Äôs half yearly report the income was 80 million roubles. In January 2006 a number of daily sign-ups had reached 38,000.

He served briefly with his regiment in the North African Campaign and extensively in Northern Europe as part of the D Day landings. His book, Troop Leader: A Tank Commander's Story is a rare example of the experiences of front line tank warfare in the Second World War written not from an analytical point of view, but as a diary of the events which happened. He was one of the first British soldiers to be able to wander unhindered in the ruins of Berlin's government area in the immediate post cease fire period of 1945. On 5 March 1945 Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery presented him with the Military Cross, for his bravery during the battle for the hamlet of Doornhoek, near Berlicum in the Netherlands, in October 1944. Under heavy German machine-gun, mortar and shell fire, and in a minefield, he retrieved his burning tank and crew before overrunning the enemy's position to allow infantrymen to push through. Early life Lionel Gale \\"Bill\\" Bellamy was born on 1 December 1923 in Northampton, the only son of Captain Ronald Vincent Bellamy and Olive Helen Gale of Shaldon, Devonshire. His father, Ronald, was a salesman who served in France during the First World War and later became a POW in the North African campaign during the Second World War. His mother, Olive, was a dress designer. He attended Hawthorn Community Primary School in Kettering, then Blackfriars (Dominican) boarding school in nearby Laxton at the age of 11. During his time there he converted to Catholicism. He always believed his faith had given him strength to endure combat.  Military career  Bellamy received his call-up when he turned 18, which disrupted his plans to go to a university. He signed up in December 1941 to the Royal Armoured Corps (RAC) after being assured by the recruiting sergeant that he could serve with his father in the 1st Armoured Division, and was sent to training at the 58th Training Regiment (RAC) at Bovington Camp in Dorset.  Nickname  It was at this time Bellamy received his nickname. The other men in his billet were introducing themselves and he became embarrassed, thinking that he might suffer some ragging if it was known he was called Lionel so he gave his name as Bill and for the rest of his life he was (quite happily) known as Bill Bellamy.  Commissioning  During training and after returning from a period of sick leave for diesel poisoning he was promoted to lance corporal and selected as a potential officer. After passing the commissions board he was sent to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst as an officer cadet in August 1942. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 20 March 1943. In the company of a friend he applied successfully to Brigadier John Van der Byl DSO for selection as a cornet in the 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars. He eventually made his way to Kasra-nil Barracks, Cairo where he joined the regiment under the command of Colonel Cuthie Goulburn. The hussars then sailed to England to begin training for D Day and were embarked for France with the 7th Armoured Division.  D Day to Berlin  A Cromwell Tank Initially he was placed in charge of an echelon which meant he had to shepherd his group of supply vehicles to various locations to replenish stock used by the regiment. During the Battle of Villers-Bocage his jeep ran into retreating German infantry and was hit by sub-machine gun fire. He was wounded in the head but after receiving seven stitches stayed at his post. A Squadron required re-organisation after Villers-Bocage and Bellamy was drafted in as troop leader of 3rd Troop where he took over as commander of his own Cromwell Tank, one of three in the troop. On his first day in command of 3rd Troop he chanced upon two British armoured cars from the 61st Reconnaissance Regiment. As they approached him they were hit by fire from a well concealed enemy gun Dismounting his own vehicle Bill Bellamy approached the two destroyed armoured cars and rescued several members of the crews whom he found alive in the wrecked and gore streaked interiors. This was the first of many experiences as a tank commander in the van of the battle he was required to face an increasingly desperate, retreating German army at its fiercest and most savage in what can only be described as \\"heavy combat\\" situations. Through France, Belgium, the Netherlands and into the German heartland following the line of advance of the Eighth Army which the tank and cavalry regiments were spearheading.  Military cross  On 22 October 1944 Bellamy's troop was part of a screen for infantry advancing near Doornhoek in the south of the Netherlands when it came under small arms, mortar and artillery fire. He engaged the enemy posts, eventually taking out three, and assisted the infantry in getting forward. Machine gun bullets struck his tank and caused molten lead to splatter in his face, and his tank entered a minefield and nearly ran over a mine. A jerry can of petrol spilt and set his bedding on fire, but he managed to get his burning tank and crew to safety. His beret was later found to have two bullet holes in it. For his gallantry, he was awarded the Military Cross, which was personally presented to him by Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery in a ceremony on 5 March 1945.  Into Germany  Chaffee tank Bellamy was given a leave to return to England upon the untimely death of his mother who was killed by a V-2 rocket in London. Whilst there he was hospitalised for a bout of recurring jaundice which had dogged him since his time in Egypt. His own opinion was that this was timely as he had been advised by fellow officers that he had become \\"bomb happy\\" and was intentionally placing himself in the most dangerous of situations without concern for his safety or that of his tank crew. On his return to the regiment, by now close to Harburg following the relief of Fallingbostel POW Camp he was advised he was to take over as second in command of the Reconnaissance Troop under the command of Tim Pierson. He was allocated a Chaffee tank which formed part of the main equipment of the Reconnaissance Troop and immediately began operations in this new role. Following operations in observation of the Elbe and the relief of a POW camp containing around 100 Belgians the regiment entered Hamburg after the surrender of that city. The condition of the city and its people made him feel very uncomfortable and his feelings towards the German populace mellowed from that of hate to that of pity. After VE Day he was able to work alongside the Catholic relief agency CCRA based at Greven near M√ºnster, helping displaced persons.  Berlin  On 4 July 1945 the regiment loaded its tanks onto transporters and set off for Berlin to take part in the victory parade. The regiment was based at the Olympic Stadium in the newly designated British Sector. At the first opportunity and before orders were issued prohibiting such activities he and some fellow officers were able to borrow a jeep and explore the administrative heart of the capital. They visited the burnt out shell of the Reichstag first and then went on to the Reich Chancellery which was looted and severely damaged in the fighting but largely intact. In Adolf Hitler's study only his desk remained. They tried to gain access to the gardens at the rear but the Russians had placed a guard on it and forbade them exploring it. They were however, able to grab some souvenirs from the detritus in the building in the form of several small etchings and cards which contained Christmas greetings from the F√ºhrer. Having interfaced with the Russians and watched a number of incidents at close quarters including the deaths of two civilians Bellamy formed the opinion that \\"it seemed abundantly clear to us that the Russians had been given carte blanche to carry out any excess in Berlin as a means of punishing and totally subduing the population.\\" On Saturday 21 July 1945 the regiment took its place behind the vehicles of the Royal Horse Artillery as second most senior army regiment on parade. The parade commenced 20 minutes late at 10:50. Promoted to captain in August 1945 Bellamy went on extended leave from what he describes as quite a leisurely life in Berlin which ended before his return as the regiment was moved to Itzehoe in Schleswig-Holstein.  Post war  Bill Bellamy was appointed adjutant of the 8th Hussars and in 1950 was organising the regiment for overseas deployment to Korea when he again became ill with another bout of recurring jaundice. Officially deemed \\"Fit for home service only\\" he was transferred to the Northamptonshire Yeomanry as adjutant, finally retiring from the army in 1955.  Civilian life and family  In 1955 Bellamy joined the board of the shoe components firm Phipps and Son and, after a merger, a board member of Chamberlain Phipps. He rose to become managing director, retiring in 1983. He then became a parish councillor at Great Brington, Northamptonshire, and took a close interest, as a Knight of the Holy Sepulchre, in the Christian Arabs of Palestine. He was for a number of years chairman of the Rugby-based Mayday Trust, which provides housing and support for vulnerable adults. He was also an active supporter of the Cynthia Spencer Hospice in Northampton, named after the current Earl of Spencer's grandmother, and raised ¬£30,000 for the hospice by trekking across Cuba in 2005, at the age of 81. Bellamy married Ann Burbury in 1950. They had four sons and one daughter: Simon, James, Andrew, Giles and Sarah. Ann died in 2001 and Bill got remarried to Felicity Sidders in 2007. His son Andrew followed in his footsteps and was commissioned in the Queen's Royal Irish Hussars, rose to the rank of brigadier, and became colonel of the regiment in November 2009 in the wake of Major General Arthur Denaro CBE DL. Bill Bellamy was also the \\"adopted\\" grandfather to two Palestinian students after financing a trip to England as part of their studies. His wartime diary and photographs remained in his attic for forty years until he rediscovered them and decided to write up his wartime experiences for his children. A publisher persuaded him to publish them, as Troop Leader, A Tank Commander's Story in 2005. He died of cancer at Barnstaple, Devon on 18 March 2009.

These objects are often displayed in association with a stylised tree, before floral decorations, guardian figures, the king and / or his attendants and open doorways or portals. The cone was apparently held up in the right hand, the bucket held hanging downwards in the left hand of the figure, which is almost always that of a winged genie or an animal-headed demon or monster (though not necessarily with the same negative connotations) - only very occasionally might these attributes be borne by a fully human figure. As to the identity of the twin objects, the \\"cone\\" is generally recognised as a Turkish pine cone (Pinus brutia), although other common identifications suggest the male inflorescence of the date palm (Phoenix dactylifera), or as a clay model imitating the form of one or the other. The bucket was presumably either of metal or basketry and is thought to have held either water or pollen or both. Although explanatory texts regarding these objects are exceedingly rare, it does seem likely that they were together employed in rituals of purification, as revealed by their Akkadian (Aka Assyrian, Babylonian) names: 'banddud√ª' (\\"bucket\\") and 'mullilu' (\\"purifier\\"). In this case the fir cone would be dipped in the bucket of water before being shaken in order to ritually purify a person or object. Alternatively the close association of the objects with depictions of stylised trees has led to the suggestion that it depicts fertilisation. In this case the pollen from the male flower of the date palm would be being shaken onto the tree.

The main mission of S.O.D. is to build the designers' own interpretation and implementation of systems thinking. S.O.D. aims at enabling systems thinking to fully benefit from design thinking and practice, and design thinking and practice to fully benefit from systems thinking. S.O.D. addresses design for human activity systems, and can be applied to any kind of design problem ranging from product design and interaction design, through architecture to decision making processes and policy design.  Background  Design is getting more and more complex for a number of reasons, for example due to globalization, need for sustainability, and the introduction of new technology and increased use of automation. Many of the challenges designers meet today can be considered wicked problems.Rittel, Horst, and Melvin Webber, 1973. \\"Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning.\\" Policy Sciences 4: 155-169. The characteristics of a wicked problem include among others that there are no definitive formulation of the problem and that the solutions are never true-or-false, but rather better or worse. A traditional problem solving approach is not sufficient in addressing for such design problems. S.O.D. is an approach that addresses the challenges the designer faces when working with complex systems and wicked problems, providing tools and techniques which makes it easier for the designer to grasp the complexity of the problem at hand. With a systems- oriented approach towards design, the designer acknowledges that the starting point for the design process is constantly moving, and that \\"every implemented solution is consequential. It leaves \\"traces\\" that cannot be undone.\\" (see Rittel and Webber's 5th property of wicked problems). Designers are well suited to work with complexity and wicked problems for a number of reasons: * They are trained and experienced in creative thinking and idea generation; * They know how to synthesize solutions from complex and fuzzy material; * Designers have an ability to visualize, which is an enormous advantage for understanding and communicating complexity. S.O.D. emphasizes these abilities as central and seeks to further train the designer in systems thinking and systems practice as a skill and an art.  Origins  Systems-oriented design builds on systems theory and systems thinking in order to develop practices for addressing complexity in design. Particularly influential is soft systems methodology (SSM), acknowledging conflicting worldviews and people's purposeful actions,Peter Checkland and John Polter, 2006. Learning For Action: A Short Definitive Account of Soft Systems Methodology, and its use Practitioners, Teachers and Students. Wiley. and a systems view on creativity. However, S.O.D. is inspired by critical systems thinking and approaches systems theories in an eclectic way transforming the thoughts of the different theories to fit the design process. The design disciplines build on their own traditions and have a certain way of working with problems, often referred to as design thinkingThe definition of design thinking is not completely agreed upon and the term is used somewhat differently by different people. There is currently considerable academic and business interest in developing further understanding of what design thinking is.Rowe, G. Peter (1987). Design Thinking. Cambridge: The MIT Press. .Tim Brown, 2009. Change by Design: How Design Thinking Transforms Organizations and Inspires Innovation. HarperBusiness. Nigel Cross, 2011. Design Thinking: Understanding How Designers Think and Work. Berg Publishers or the design way.Harold G. Nelson and Erik Stolterman, 2002. The Design Way: Intentional Change in an Unpredictable World : Foundations and Fundamentals of Design Competence. Educational Technology Pubns Design thinking is a creative process based around the \\"building up\\" of ideas. This style of thinking is one of the advantages of the designer and is the reason why simply employing one of the existing systems approach into design, like for example systems engineering, is not found sufficient by the advocates of S.O.D. Compared with other systems approaches, S.O.D. is less concerned with hierarchies and borders of systems, modelling and feedback loops, and more focused on the whole fields of relations and patterns of interactions. S.O.D. seeks richness rather than simplification of the complex systems.  Systems thinking in the design process  Important in the systems-oriented design process is to carry out activities in order to grasp the complexity of the system designed for, and to accommodate for a creative process taking place. In order to gain the necessary understanding of the complex system, a comprehensive data capture and analysis phase is needed. Visualizations play a vital role in the design process, both as a means to analyze and understand the information gathered, and in order to communicate. The obtained insight into the complex system is used to come up with solutions for the design problem. Methods and techniques from other disciplines are used in order to understand the complexity of the system, including for example ethnographic studies, risk analysis, and scenario thinking. Methods and concepts unique to S.O.D. include for example the Rich Design Space,Birger Sevaldson, 2008. Rich Design Research Space. Form Akademisk. http://www.formakademisk.org/index.php/formakademisk/article/view/17 GIGA- mapping,Birger Sevaldson, 2011. GIGA-Mapping: Visualisation for complexity and systems thinking in design. Paper presented at NORDES 2011, 30 May 2011. http://ocs.sfu.ca/nordes/index.php/nordes/2011/paper/view/409 and Incubation Techniques. The Rich Design Space includes the physical space of the design studio with sketches, ideas, mood boards, plans etc. and the virtual digital design space of the design software, media like video and sound recording, traditional design techniques and even the social space created in the project. By paying attention to the richness of the design space, the design space can become a very efficient tool to maintain an overview of the complexity of the project all the way. GIGA-mapping is the central tool for registering, analyzing and managing complexity in S.O.D.. It is used for systematizing and interrelating the information and knowledge obtained. Incubation is one of the 4 proposed stages of creativity: preparation, incubation, illumination, and verification.Hadamard, J. (1945). The Psychology of Invention in the Mathematical Field. Princeton University Press Incubation Techniques are techniques used by the designer in order to acquire the background knowledge needed for an incubation process to take place. S.O.D. has proved valuable for designers to quickly acquire knowledge of a new domains, and to reveal unexpected parts of a system where a new design can be beneficial.  Further development and applications  The concept of systems- oriented design was initially proposed by professor Birger Sevaldson at the Oslo School of Architecture and Design (AHO) in the context of the OCEAN design research network. The S.O.D. approach is currently under development through teaching and research projects, as well as through the work of design practitioners. AHO provides Master courses in Systems Oriented Design each term as part of their Industrial Design program. In these courses, design students are trained in using the tools and techniques of S.O.D. in projects with outside partners. Research projects in systems-oriented design are carried out at the Centre for Design ResearchResearch related to the topic Systems carried out at AHO Centre for Design Research: http://www.designresearch.no/themes/systems at AHO in order to develop the concept, methods and tools further. In 2016 the project Systemic Approach to Architectural Performance was announced as an institutional cooperation between the Faculty of Art and Architecture at the Technical University of Liberec and the Oslo School of Architecture and Design. Its mission is to link the methodology of systems-oriented design with performance-oriented architecture on the case study Marie Davidova's project Wood as a Primary Medium to Architectural Performance. The Oslo-based design consultancy Halogen (www.halogen.no) has used SOD extensively with a varied range of customers. They have suggested a typology of Gigamaps and contributed with other methodological developments. Gigamapping and other SOD methods are used by a growing range of businesses and educational institutions.

The first station was opened in 1866 and the current station building was completed in 1883. It is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 3 station. It is a stop for Intercity-Express and Intercity services and is a public transport node for northern Hesse. Since 2006, Cantus Verkehrsgesellschaft has operated regional services on the Fulda‚ÄìBad Hersfeld‚ÄìKassel route. Station buildings vestibule, 1 + 2 class waiting room, ladies room and buffet are now a waiting room. In the former telegraph and station master's room there is now a DB Service Store At the opening of the line between Bebra and Bad Hersfeld on 22 January 1866, a station building was built, only as a temporary measure, known as the Bude (shack). This building was later extended and still exists made of wood shingles south of the current station building. Its temporary nature was obviously a result of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. The subsequent annexation of Hesse-Kassel by Prussia meant that the temporary station served for 17 years. Romanesque Revival half column with capital The current station building was opened in 1883 and was designed by the architect Paul Rowald, who worked at this time in the civil engineering office of the railway division () of Frankfurt. The building is a two-storey sandstone building in the Romanesque Revival style. The floors are separated by a cornice, which runs around the entire building. The sandstone for the station came from a quarry near Jossa. The station building has a rectangular central block, with a risalit at the centre of the facade on the station forecourt. This has a gable which is accented by a cornice. The station clock is installed in the gable. The risalit contains the main entrance at ground level, in the form of a circular arch, the distinguishing characteristic of Romanesque buildings. This form appears in all the ground floor windows and in the windows in the gables. On both sides of this central block are two symmetrical wings, which slightly protrude from the central block both at the front and at the rear. These have the same architectural style as the central block and have high gables. Geodetic height benchmarks from 1883 Rowald took the Romanesque style elements from the architecture of existing medieval buildings in the old town of Hersfeld, for example from the ruins of the Romanesque abbey, without copying their individual elements (Gelnhausen station, which was also designed by Rowald, has a similar design). Rowald drew heavily on the Romanesque style in the shape of the window on the ground floor, the window frames with their half-columns and capitals and the arched windows in the gables. The tops of the gable with adorned with finials; these are borrowed from Gothic architecture. On the south side there is a one-story building that was built in 1908 that matched the style of the main building. This building was rebuilt in 1957 as a pavilion with a hipped roof. The station restaurant was located in this building until 2005. The exterior of the station has been preserved largely unchanged, but the interior of the building has been rebuilt several times and the floor plan has been changed. This occurred most recently between 2005 and 2008. During this time, the station and the pedestrian underpass were upgraded and redesigned. In 2008, the Federation of German Architects (Bund Deutscher Architekten) gave the participating developers, the town of Bad Hersfeld, the Nordhessischer Verkehrsverbund (North Hessian Transport Association), Deutsche Bahn and the architects involved the Simon-Louis-du-Ry- Plakette architectural prize.

History In January 1984, Sweden introduced a 0.5% tax on the purchase or sale of an equity security. Hence, a round trip (purchase and sale) transaction resulted in a 1% tax. The tax applied to all equity security trades in Sweden using local brokerage services as well as to stock options. In July 1986, the rate was doubled, and in January 1989, a considerably lower tax of 0.002% on fixed-income securities was introduced for a security with a maturity of 90 days or less. On a bond with a maturity of five years or more, the tax was 0.003%. 15 months later, on 15 April 1990, the tax on fixed-income securities was abolished. In January 1991 the rates on the remaining taxes were cut by half and by the end of the year, they were also abolished completely. Once the taxes were eliminated, trading volumes returned and grew substantially in the 1990s.Financial Transaction Taxes: The International Experience and the Lessons for Canada. http://dsp-psd.tpsgc.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/BP/bp419-e.htm Market reaction On the day that the tax was announced, share prices fell by 2.2%. But there was leakage of information prior to the announcement, which might explain the 5.35% price decline in the 30 days prior to the announcement. When the tax was doubled, prices again fell by another 1%. These declines were in line with the capitalized value of future tax payments resulting from expected trades. It was further felt that the taxes on fixed-income securities only served to increase the cost of government borrowing, providing another argument against the tax. Even though the tax on fixed-income securities was much lower than that on equities, the impact on market trading was much more dramatic. During the first week of the tax, the volume of bond trading fell by 85%, even though the tax rate on five-year bonds was only 0.003%. The volume of futures trading fell by 98% and the options trading market disappeared. 60% of the trading volume of the eleven most actively traded Swedish share classes moved to the UK after the announcement in 1986 that the tax rate would double. 30% of all Swedish equity trading moved offshore. By 1990, more than 50% of all Swedish trading had moved to London. Foreign investors reacted to the tax by moving their trading offshore while domestic investors reacted by reducing the number of their equity trades. According to Anders Borg who served as finance minister in the Swedish government from 2006 to 2014, \\"between 90%-99% of traders in bonds, equities and derivatives moved out of Stockholm to London.\\" Revenues As a result, revenues from these taxes were disappointing. For example, revenues from the tax on fixed-income securities were initially expected to amount to 1,500 million Swedish kronor per year. They did not amount to more than 80 million Swedish kronor in any year and the average was closer to 50 million.Campbell, John Y. and Froot, Kenneth A. \\"International Experiences with Securities Transaction Taxes (December 1993),\\" NBER Working Paper No. W4587. https://ssrn.com/abstract=338864 In addition, as taxable trading volumes fell, so did revenues from capital gains taxes, entirely offsetting revenues from the equity transactions tax that had grown to 4,000 million Swedish kronor by 1988.Umlauf, Steven R. (1993). \\"Transaction Taxes and the Behavior of the Swedish Stock Market,\\" Journal of Financial Economics, 33, p. 227-240 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jfinec/v33y1993i2p227-240.html See also * ATTAC (Association for the Taxation of Financial Transactions for the Aid of Citizens) * Financial markets * Financial transaction tax * Foreign exchange market * Money market * Speculation * Tobin tax * Transfer tax * Volatility (finance) * Volatility risk References External links * European Commission Working Paper on FTT Category:Taxation in Sweden Sweden ","title":"Swedish financial transaction tax"},{"id":"33914310","text":"Epimachus Jacobus Johannes Baptista (Eppo) Cremers (15 June 1823 in Groningen - 27 October 1896 in Z√ºrich) was a Dutch politician.

The film stars Rajesh Khanna in the lead role, supported by Neetu Singh, Vinod Mehra, Simple Kapadia, Pradeep Kumar, Om Shivpuri, Dina Pathak, Master Raju Shrestha, Yunuz Parvez, Pinchoo Kapoor and others. Upon release, the film became critically acclaimed. This film was co- produced by Rajesh Khanna with Yusuf Hassan. Plot Rajesh Khanna plays a man drawn unwillingly into a nest of enemy spies and intrigue with the future of his country riding on his shoulders. Chhaya (Neetu) and Amit Narayan (Rajesh) are in love and Chhaya wants to get married. Amit doesn't see why they have to get married and wants to keep things as they are. Wedding dates are set and then moved, to her great frustration. This is really their only point of discord. Amit lives alone, and is also very fond of Chhaya's family: father (Om Shivpuri), mother (Dina Pathak), little brother Raju (Master Raju Shrestha) and sister Maya (Rozeena). It is Diwali, and as children burst crackers and set off potentially limb-severing fireworks, Amit's upstairs neighbor Raman (Vinod Mehra) has been watching a group of men in a tent just outside the building's courtyard. They also appear to be keeping tabs on him, and have his manservant in their pay. Now, Raman tosses furniture about the room and loads a pistol and then takes a body out of a trunk, lays it out on the floor, sprinkles it with whiskey and as another set of firecrackers explode outside, he shoots the poor dead guy's face off. When Amit returns home, Raman is waiting for him and forces his way in. He explains to Amit that he is a spy for India and that he is being watched by enemy agents (he shows the tent and its inhabitants to Amit through the window). He has set up his own suicide (using a morgue body) to throw the enemies off his trail and needs to stay with Amit for a few days in hiding. The unnamed enemy is plotting to destroy India's valuable relationship with an African country called Mazaland by assassinating its Chief Minister when he arrives 19 November at the Delhi International Airport. Raman wants to wait until his enemies hear of his \\"suicide\\" and depart before he sets off for Delhi to stop the assassination himself. He shaves his beard and dons thick black glasses to disguise himself and Amit reluctantly agrees to let him stay for a few days. The enemy agents are not put off by the sensational news of Raman's suicide and stay put themselves. The next day, Raman pries the back off his watch; hidden behind the watch face is a teeny-tiny red notebook. He opens it up and begins writing. Amit is meanwhile visiting Chhaya and her family again to talk about wedding details. Amit indulges in room talk with Chaya's family. Chhaya's family is a close and warm family. But when Aman returns home, he gets a shock. Raman has been murdered and Amit's living room turned upside down, and the men in the tent outside have disappeared. Amit wonders what to do next. He has a fantasy about being arrested for murder after calling in the cops. Then he wanders around his room and then makes a cup of tea. In the sugar jar is the not-as-teeny-tiny-as-it-used-to-be red notebook, hidden by Raman. Raman has written down some clues about the gang (known to him only as Z, P, R and M) and their plan to kill the Chief Minister of Mazaland. He begs Amit to stop them himself: to take the notebook with him to Delhi and hand it over to the police there. Although it was pitch-dark outside moments ago, Amit looks out the window and the sun is shining brightly as the dudhwala approaches on his bicycle. Amit takes off his own clothes very skillfully underneath a towel, and gives the milkman money for his dhoti-kurta‚Äîwhich he somewhat unwillingly gives up. And so Amit's endless journey of swapping outfits and changing clothes begins. The poor milkman finds the grim scene in Amit's living room and calls the police. The police naturally assume that Amit is the culprit and put out an all-points bulletin for his arrest. The rest of the story is full of suspense. Will he make it to Delhi in time? Will he find the enemy's camp and manage to stop the assassination? Can India possibly survive the severing of ties with Mazaland if he doesn't? Who is the real brains behind this plot, anyway? And will he ever set a wedding date with Chhaya? Quotes Before the release of the film, director Basu Chatterjee said to Screen India: \\"If the artiste lives up to that image, I'm satisfied. In Chakravyuh, Kaka has interpreted his role beautifully. I will say this much. If the film flops, I am responsible for it. Khanna has performed very well. He gives me what performance I want very easily within an hour, whereas other actors generally would take around 8 hours to give the same kind of performance as I want.

History United States Naval Construction Battalion SEVEN (NCB 7) was commissioned on 17 June 1942 at the Naval Construction Training Center, Camp Allen, Norfolk, Virginia, under the command of Commander Julius L. Piland, Civil Engineer Corps, U.S. Naval Reserve. 1940s through 1970s During World War II, NCB 7 saw deployments to Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides; Iroquois Point, Hawaii; Marianas Islands; and Okinawa, Japan. NCB 7 was decommissioned for the first time on 30 October 1945 in Okinawa. On 22 August 1951, MCB 7 was commissioned for a second time at the U.S. Naval Yards and Docks Supply Depot in Davisville, Rhode Island, under the command of Lieutenant Commander Robert F. Smart, Civil Engineer Corps, U.S. Naval Reserve. From October 1957 to August 1959, MCB 7 set a record by remaining deployed to three isolated islands in the West Indies, completing the largest construction project ever undertaken by a peace time Atlantic Construction Battalion. This project consisted of two complete Coast Guard LORAN Stations. In 1961 the battalion was ordered to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba in support of the base's ground defense force. In addition to the defense mission, MCB 7, together with her sister battalion MCB 4, constructed more than 20 miles of perimeter roads and other base facilities in record time. NMCB Seven was selected \\"Best of Type\\" in the Atlantic Fleet and awarded the Battle Efficiency \\"E\\" for fiscal year 1963. In 1966, MCB 7 was deployed to the Republic of South Vietnam, until her decommissioning at the Construction Battalion Center, Davisville, Rhode Island, in August 1970. 1980s through 2010s NMCB 7 was commissioned for a third time on 1 August 1985 aboard Naval Construction Battalion Center Gulfport, Mississippi under the command of CDR C. David Binning, Civil Engineer Corps, U. S. Navy. The commissioning marked the first time in over 17 years that a new construction battalion had been brought on line. In December 1985, following the completion of a rigorous homeport training program, NMCB Seven made preparations for their first deployment as a newly recommissioned Battalion. The main body deployed to Naval Station Rota Spain with details sent to Bermuda, Greece, Crete, Scotland, Italy, and Germany. On 8 August 1990, the Battalion was ordered to mobilize for redeployment to the Middle East in direct support of Operation Desert Shield. All details except for the Civic Action Team were rolled back to Okinawa within 72-hours. On 10 September, the Air Detachment departed Kadena Air Force Base, Okinawa for the Middle East to begin setting up Camp Sierra India Bravo, followed by the Advance Party on 29 September, and the Main body on 10 October. From 1991 through 2002 NMCB Seven completed ten deployments to Rota, Spain; Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, Okinawa, Japan In 2003, NMCB Seven deployed to Southwest Asia in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Battalion supported Marine units by constructing roads and maintaining camps throughout Kuwait and Iraq. NMCB Seven supported combat operations by maintaining main and alternate supply routes and jointly constructing the longest ever NCF Mabey-Johnson span bridge at Az Zubidayah. For its extraordinary heroism and outstanding performance of duty in action against enemy forces from March ‚Äì April 2003 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, NMCB Seven was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation. In 2005 NMCB Seven provided the initial response to Hurricane Katrina and was the first unit to provide disaster recovery support. In the aftermath of Katrina, NMCB Seven was tasked with many key projects assisting the Mississippi Gulf Coast recovery from the massive devastation. The Battalion assisted the Coast Guard, Gulfport Sheriff's Department, and Fish and Wildlife Commission gaining access to water assets in order to conduct search and rescue operations. The scope soon expanded to include demolition of old buildings, clearing railroad tracks around the Port of Gulfport, and building temporary shelters for fuel tanks. In all, NMCB Seven removed 250 damaged trees, 3000 tons of steel and scrap metal, and 600 tons of other debris. NMCB Seven was selected as the Atlantic Fleet Naval Construction Force Battle Efficiency \\"E\\" winner. In February 2006 NMCB Seven deployed to Kuwait, CENTCOM AOR, and other locations in direct support of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT). The battalion was spread over 4 continents and 13 countries in 25 locations. In June 2007, NMCB Seven deployed to Okinawa, Japan operating the main body from Camp Shields. The majority of NMCB Seven's Seabees were located in the U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM) area of operations, from San Clemente Island on the California coast to Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. An additional 50 Seabees from NMCB Seven were detached to the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) in Afghanistan. On 1 October 2008, NMCB Seven deployed to Al Taqaddum, Iraq and various other locations, including some smaller detachments in Afghanistan. From there, they began the turnover process once again with NMCB Three. In December 2008, NMCB Seven received orders to redeploy to Camp Bastion in Helmand Province, Afghanistan to construction the new base code named Tombstone 1 which eventually became Camp Leatherneck, the headquarters of the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade. NMCB Seven also pushed out multiple detachments in preparation for joint Spring offenses including Camp Dwyer. In January 2010, NMCB Seven Air Detachment was dispatched to Port-au-Prince, Haiti to assist with disaster relief amidst the devastation 7.0 earthquake that struck the country. A month later, the battalion deployed to various locations throughout Europe, Africa, and South America as part of its regularly scheduled 2010 deployment to provide contingency construction, humanitarian and civic assistance and exercise related construction projects. By the end of deployment, the battalion had successfully completed construction and contingency projects in 33 separate locations in Africa, Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, Central and South America, with more than 120 Seabees continually assigned to Combined Joint Task Force Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) at Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti, as an enduring Detachment, with smaller Detachments completing projects in Kenya, Comoros, Ethiopia, and the Djiboutian countryside.http://www.public.navy.mil/necc/1ncd/Pages/NMCB7/history.aspx Decommissioning On 5 September 2012, Naval Mobile Construction Battalion SEVEN was decommissioned at the Naval Construction Battalion Center Gulfport, Mississippi.

By the late 1850s, the collection was deteriorating, with many works in poor condition, and the Marchese started selling works to pay of his debts. His son Marchese Alfonso Costabili Contain eventually sold the remainder of the collection in 1885.

It measures 2.6 mm. The whorls of the protoconch are small, almost completely obliquely immersed, only part of the last rounded volution is visible above the first of the later whorls. The 5¬Ω whorls of the teleoconch are somewhat inflated, well rounded and moderately shouldered. They are marked by strong. equally developed. spiral keels which are separated by subequal, deep, rounded sulci. The latter are somewhat broader than the keels and crossed by many, very slender raised axial threads. Three keels are present upon the first and second, on the third a fourth keel appears partly at the suture, but the greater part of it is covered up by the summit of the succeeding volution. The penultimate whorl has four keels, the posterior one of which marks the summit and is a little wider than the rest and somewhat flattened. The periphery of the body whorl is marked by a sulcus. The base of the shell is well rounded and attenuated. It is ornamented like the spaces between the sutures, having six spiral keels. These keels, as well as the sulci, gradually diminish in breadth from the periphery to the umbilical region. The aperture is oval. The outer lip is thin, showing the external sculpture within. The columella is rather heavy, somewhat curved, backed up by the attenuated base and provided with a strong oblique fold at its insertion. The parietal wall is covered by a thin callus.

Movies Japan - Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger vs. Abaranger Plot Responding to a local disturbance, the Dekarangers apprehend Abared, Abare Blue and Abare Yellow, who were in the middle of chasing a raven. After interrogating the three Abarangers, the Dekarangers are ordered to bring them to the Deka Room, where they are all briefed on the shape-shifting Ginjifuan Kazak. The Abarangers explain that they were contacted by a curry shop owner friend of theirs who is being targeted by Kazak; hence their short battle with Kazak, who changed into a raven and fled while the Abarangers were arrested. Despite Doggie Kruger's suggestion to investigate the curry shop, both Super Sentai groups get into a heated argument over their methods of justice. However, when Yukito discovers a weak spot on Doggie's back and uses his chiropractic skills to fix it, Doggie suggests for Ban to team up with Ryoga. Meanwhile, at a meeting with Kazak, Agent Abrella breaks open a red orb to unleash Trinoid #0 Saunaginnan, who had been sealed away by Mikela as he was deemed too powerful. Saunaginnan demonstrates his power by reviving the previously deleted Reversian Succubus and Speckionian Genio. However, Saunaginnan quickly wears out his energy, as he is missing two gingko nut batteries that power his abilities. Kazak takes the two revived Alienizers to retrieve the gingko nuts, giving each of them a piece of the shattered orb. Ban and Ryoga arrive at Dino House, which has grown to become the country's largest curry shop. There, they meet the Trinoid Yatsudenwani, who has replaced Mr. Sugishita as the president of the restaurant chain. He explains to the duo that he had kept the orb that contained Saunaginnan when it was stolen, but he reveals that he has the two gingko nuts. Kazak suddenly appears and attacks Yatsudenwani before Deka Red and Aba Red interfere. However, during the fight, the clock strikes 11:00 and Aba Red suddenly leaves the fight to make a phone call to his niece Mai, who is currently taking up acting classes in Hollywood. This causes Kazak to defeat the two warriors and leave with the gingko nuts, announcing his plans to resurrect all of the deleted Alienizers and Dezumozorlya. Meanwhile, Succubus and Genio wreak havoc in two different places in town. Deka Blue, Deka Green and Deka Break assume they can easily defeat Genio by hitting his chest, but to no effect. Abare Blue pinpoints a weakness in his third vertebra, enabling the four warriors to once again delete him. Jasmine, Umeko and Ranru prepare to battle Succubus, but the Alienizer spits out a gel that clogs up their transformation devices. After distracting Succubus with some cosplaying tactics, Ranru finds a formula to dissolve the gel, enabling all three to transform and defeat Succubus. Both Genio and Succubus are reduced to the orb chunks that were in their possession. Deka Red and Aba Red once again face Kazak, but they both end up fighting each other over Aba Red's phone call. While Kazak's platoon of Anaroids massage him, Aba Red explains to Deka Red that he made a promise to call Mai before her audition. This gives Kazak the opportunity to throw both red warriors off the building. However, some last-minute teamwork brings them both back in the fight, which is suddenly interrupted by Asuka playing his harmonica. Enraged by the presence of evil on Another Earth, Abare Black attacks Kazak, who is then forced to retreat into the orb chunk he carries. Meanwhile, at a cave, Saunaginnan becomes fully charged, causing the orb chunks to glow into a trail while Earth becomes engulfed in a thick fog. The Dekarangers and Abarangers follow the trail, but are confronted by Kazak and Saunaginnan, with the revived Ben-G, Milibar and Bon-Goblin and an army of Anaroids. Kazak sends the heroes in confusion by shape-shifting into Numa-O and Hurricane Red. The fog gets thicker as the door to hell opens in the sky, but as everyone anticipates the arrival of Dezumozorlya, Mikoto Nakadai and TopGaler come out instead. After Doggie enters the fight, both Dekarangers and Abarangers shuffle members to defeat the revived Alienizers. The heroes then use the D-Bazooka and Superior Dino Bomber to delete Kazak and Saunaginnan. Kazak, however, dodges the blast and boards his Heavy Industrial Machine PalletteView while Saunaginnan is resurrected into a giant. Super Dekaranger Robo and Killer AbarenOh destroy the two giants with a combined Gatling Punch and Gatling Drill Spin attack. As a side-effect of defeating Saunaginnan, Mikoto must return to the afterlife, but not before telling Asuka to give his regards to his daughter. Back at Deka Base, the Dekarangers and Abarangers celebrate their victory with a party hosted by Yatsudenwani, who irritates the Dekarangers with his singing. It is later on revealed that Doggie was one of Dino House's regular customers. Meanwhile, the girls and Emiri enjoy a bubble bath before Yatsudenwani barges in. They chase him around the Deka Room before everyone stops to have a group photo taken.

In the effect of a three-day-long struggle for the control of the city of Grodno (modern Hrodna, Belarus), the town was captured by Russian forces, despite repeated counter-attacks by Polish infantry, tanks and armoured trains.  Opposing forces  The Polish forces during the battle included an improvised group of battle-ready forces and second-echelon troops, with the most valuable unit being a single battalion of the 1st Tank Regiment (two companies, 43 FT-17 tanks in total). Infantry forces consisted of roughly 3000 men at arms. While officially they were all part of the 9th Infantry Division, hardly any were front-line troops. Instead, the Polish defences were manned by sentry guards, mobilised railway workers, students of a local NCO school and remnants of various units defeated near Wilno a couple of days before. Regular units included elements of 13th Uhlans Regiment. Although the town had been fortified by Russians in the 19th century, the forts were in disrepair and did not provide much advantage to the defenders. J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski later noted in his memoirs, that \\"Grodno, called a fortress to praise military ears, is called a fortress only in our and Soviet books, where a place could be called a place d'armes even if it has no railroad, fortifications have no barbed wire, a hurricane-like barrage could come from a couple of broken guns and a fortress could have but a couple of blown-up forts\\". The Russian forces assaulting the city were composed of Hayk Bzhishkyan's 3rd Cavalry Corps. Initially on July 19 only the 15th Cavalry Division took part in the assault. However, in later stages of the battle the entire 10th Cavalry Division joined the struggle, as well as 1st, 2nd and 3rd Kuban Cavalry Brigades and numerous infantry detachments travelling on horse- drawn carts. In the later part of the battle the Russian side was reinforced with additional forces, including the 12th Rifle Division.  Prelude  Following the failure of the Kiev Offensive, the Polish armies retreated westwards from central Belarus and Ukraine. Although the Bolshevik forces failed to surround or destroy the bulk of the Polish Army, most Polish units were in dire need of fresh reinforcements. However, following the successful retreat from the line of Berezina, the Polish commanders believed the situation in the northern sector of the front was under control. Grodno was crucial to both sides as a crossing of the Neman River and a major rail hub along the Saint Petersburg‚ÄìWarsaw Railway. Furthermore, after the loss of Wilno (modern Vilnius) on July 14, the town was to be the axis of a new defence line, running from Lida along the Neman. In the area of Grodno two Polish divisions broke contact with the enemy and successfully withdrew to a 50 kilometre line of dilapidated fortifications surrounding the city. Additional forces were on their way from Wilno. While the forts had been destroyed in 1915 during World War I, the surrounding fortifications could still be of some use to the defenders. However, General Mokrzecki charged with organising the defence of the area did not issue any orders to the newly arrived 9th Infantry Division and did not prepare the defence of the city. His mistakes could not be corrected by his superior, General Gustaw Zygad≈Çowicz, the commanding officer of the Polish First Army as he was stranded in an isolated village following his staff car's malfunction and lost contact with his troops for two days. Furthermore, on July 18 the Polish Cipher Bureau intercepted a Russian report claiming that the 3rd Cavalry Corps driving towards Grodno was exhausted and that its horses were in need of rest. The report was sent to Polish units in the area, and made them believe an assault on the city was highly unlikely.  July 19  Despite the earlier intelligence reports, the Russians attacked already in the early hours of the following day. The Russian attack broke through the Polish infantry after 8 hours of heavy fighting. Gen. Mokrzecki, having committed all his infantry reserves to the fight, ordered the 2nd tank platoon under 2nd Lt. Bohdan Je≈ºewski to counter-attack towards the village of Grandzicze, directly to the north of the town. The tanks drove through the city's streets and pushed the Russian cavalry out. After that the Polish tanks assumed defensive positions in a cemetery located right outside city limits. Later that day a second wave of Russian forces arrived, having routed two reserve squadrons of Polish cavalry operating to the east of Grodno. However, when the Russian 10th Cavalry Division charged towards the rail road circling the town from the east, they were fired upon by tanks of the 1st company, still loaded on flatcars and operating as an improvised armoured train. The Russian force was forced to retreat after suffering heavy losses. Despite this initial success, the village of Stanis≈Çaw√≥w (at the north-eastern outskirts of the city) had to be abandoned soon afterwards, as the Russian 2nd and 3rd Cavalry Brigades gained entry to the city further west, near the suburb of Dziewiat√≥wka. General Mokrzecki panicked, and ordered all Polish troops withdrawn from the eastern part of the town back to the city centre, to the vicinity of the train station and the bridges across Neman River. The approaching Russians however were not able to capture the bridges as both were blown up by Polish engineers around 19:30 hours, by then already under enemy fire. The loss of the train station and the bridges forced trains with additional Polish reinforcements from Podlasie to be diverted elsewhere, which further complicated the situation of the defenders. Downtown Grodno on a 1920 postcard After the successful retreat to the south-western bank of the river, only the 3rd tank platoon of 2nd company and some isolated Polish infantry forces were left in the city. The company successfully sortied towards the village of Grandzicze north of Grodno, but returned to the cemetery it had been defending since noon. As the platoon did not have communication with other units, it was not informed of the general retreat across the river. In the evening Russian artillery came into range and started shelling the Polish position from the distance. Most of the town was already in Russian hands and around 18:00 the Cossacks of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade assaulted the isolated Polish position from the back, through the narrow streets of down-town Grodno. Realising he had been cut off from friendly forces, 2nd Lt. Je≈ºewski ordered his forces to abandon the cemetery and break through towards the road bridge across the Neman. Despite heavy enemy fire, the tank platoon was still operational and did not lose any tanks, though only one was still in fighting condition. Two were down due to mechanical failures and had to be towed by other machines, two additional tanks were damaged, but with no loss of life. The tank unit was accompanied by 9 members of tank crews separated from other units and 25 soldiers of a sentry battalion who got separated from their commanding officer. The column started moving slowly towards friendly positions, with Russians trying to assault it from the sides in the narrow streets of the city centre. To help with the break-through, the 1st platoon, 1st company under Lt. Glowacki was ordered to cross the bridge once again and head towards the city centre. It did not find the isolated Polish unit and retreated back across the river. Envoys were also dispatched on foot to look for the lost detachment and eventually found the 3rd tank platoon. After two hours of constant fighting, the unit reached the last intact bridge across the Neman, at that time already set on fire. Only two tanks managed to cross the burning bridge, the rest had to be abandoned.  July 20  Despite losing the bridges, the Russian forces crossed the river overnight in several locations to the north of Grodno. To reinforce the defence of the south-western bank of Neman the XVIII Infantry Brigade (part of 9th Infantry Division) under Col. Aleksander Narbutt- ≈Åuczy≈Ñski was sent to the battlefield. It was to attack north, along the western bank of the river, and eliminate the Russian bridgeheads. By the time the Polish assault started, the Russians already were well-entrenched. Although initially the Polish brigade managed to push the Russian forces back to the line of 19th century Russian forts west of the city, the attack ultimately failed. The day's fighting resulted in a stalemate. The following day the Polish tanks withdrew further south-west and took part in a skirmish around the village of Wielka Olszanka, some from the town, again using part of the tanks as an improvised armoured train. The assault on Russian positions manning the Hill 177 and an old Russian fort No. 5 was successful and the Russians retreated towards the river, chased by Polish tanks and infantry. This temporary success did not however force the Russians out of the close side of the river and in the following days Hayk Bzhishkyan's 3rd Cavalry Corps crossed the river further north and restarted its march south-westwards, along the Grodno-Sok√≥≈Çka railway. The Polish force fought numerous delaying battles, but in the end had to retreat to Sok√≥≈Çka. The 2nd company was then withdrawn from the front and sent to ≈Å√≥d≈∫ for repairs. The 1st company remained on the front and shared the fate of the XVIII Brigade, that eventually retreated towards Warsaw and took part in the fighting along the Narew during the Battle of Warsaw in mid-August. In his memoir, Hayk Bzhishkyan recalled that the fights for Grodno cost him \\"500 killed and wounded, 400 horses and seven days of priceless time\\". Polish losses remain unknown.  Outcome  The battle ended in a defeat for the Polish forces. The line of defence running along the Neman and Szczara had to be abandoned and the Polish forces attempted to withdraw and defend Narew and Bug River lines.Davies, N., 1972, White Eagle, Red Star, London: Macdonald & Co, The defence proved equally unsuccessful and it was not until mid-August when the Poles could stop the Russian Army in the Battle of Warsaw. Several post-war authors called the Polish defence of Grodno on July 19 \\"mediocre at best\\", and argued that the officers suffered from a \\"psychosis of disaster and retreat\\". Indeed on 23 July 1920, Gen. Gustaw Zygad≈Çowicz, commander of the 1st Army was relieved of command and replaced with Gen. Jan Romer.

He was the son of George Louis, Prince of Nassau-Dillenburg (1618‚Äì1656) and his wife, Anna Augusta (17 December 1612 ‚Äì 9 June 1673), a daughter of Duke Henry Julius of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel.  Life  He studied at Herborn Academy, which could enjoy an upswing during his rule, and in France. After completing his studies, he served in the Dutch army, where he reached the rank of commander. When his grandfather, Louis Henry, Prince of Nassau-Dillenburg, died in 1662, he inherited the county, because his father had already died. When his uncle Adolph died without a male heir in 1676, he inherited Nassau-Schaumburg as well. His reign is regarded as competent but unspectacular. He tried unsuccessfully to claim the inheritance of his father-in-law, George III of Brieg. After his death, he was succeeded by his oldest son William II, and after William II died without a son, by his younger son Christian.

Also involves honking when there are other cars in front of the car in front of you, or at a red light. It is sometimes used to bully other drivers into increasing their speed, especially when they are already at or over the speed limit, but in this instance it is also accompanied by tailgating. This is normally used by aggressive, high strung drivers. ;Tailgating :Involves driving dangerously close to the vehicle ahead (often in an attempt to encourage them to increase their speed). This action can distract the operator of the forward vehicle and reduces the stopping time of the rear vehicle in case of sudden speed changes. This is generally used by aggressive drivers. Additionally, this may affect the driver of the forward car emotionally, sometimes to the point the offended driver may consider soaring to illegal speeds in an attempt to escape, which in turn creates an additional aggressive driver. ;Double parking :Double-parked vehicles can disrupt traffic flow, causing other motorists to navigate their way around them. ;Driving in busy areas with high beams on :At night this action can blind oncoming traffic, making it more difficult for vehicles to safely follow the road. When following another vehicle, glare from this action can reduce the effectiveness of the forward vehicle's mirrors ‚Äî reducing situational awareness and increasing the likelihood of an accident. ;Refusing to yield right-of-way to other vehicles :Merging vehicles must accelerate or brake unsafely or can be forced off the road at the end of a merging lane due to this action. ;Driving with loud, distracting music :Reduces the driver's ability to hear and react to noises around the vehicle (including emergency- vehicle sirens). ;Driving a vehicle with snow and ice covering it :Can endanger others if the snow-covered vehicle reaches highway speeds and chunks of ice/snow fly off behind the vehicle. Snow and ice can also slide down from the roof to block visibility from the rear window in the car, reducing the driver's situational awareness. ;Changing lanes and turning without use of signals :Increases the likelihood of an accident by surprising other drivers with a lane change or turn unexpectedly. ;Cutting off other motorists :Refers to a vehicle that enters a lane without proper caution, leaving a small amount of distance between other surrounding vehicles. This can be caused by unawareness of surroundings, impatience, and/or aggressiveness. ;Driving below the speed of traffic in center or passing lanes''' :Causes a disruption in traffic flow as other vehicles must either slow to match the offending vehicle's speed, and may be forced to pass on the wrong side. ;Slowly passing another vehicle/Using cruise control to pass a vehicle rather than accelerating :Causes a disruption for other vehicles in the passing lane for the duration of the time the passing car occupies it.Driving Etiquette Refresher  Car Pool with Bill ;Distracted driving (includes talking/texting on the phone, smoking, drinking, and eating) :Reduces driver awareness of the road and the likelihood of collision increase has been linked to drunk driving.Drivers on Cell Phones Are as Bad as Drunks - University of Utah News Release: June 29th, 2006 Pet peeves Although in some cases they pose no actual threat or danger, some actions are seen as unpleasant or pet peeves and thus classified as bad driving etiquette.

Originally a sub contract manufacturing facility, in 1982 Pailton developed their own range of universal joints and sliding shafts for steering systems. Continued expansion in the steering product market followed with the introduction in 1995 of the Pailton Mitre box or Bevel box, a device to allow 90 degree changes in direction of the steering input shaft with low backlash and no universal joint phasing allowing the steering box to be positioned in a place more favourable to the steering gear for actuation, while still placing the steering column in the best position for the driver. As Pailton were growing their product range so was the market reach, due to the opening in 1999 of Pailton Inc. in Valparaiso, Indiana, USA. In 2001 Pailton acquired SLT the steering division of Sachsenring AG resulting a manufacturing facility in Germany concentrating on ball joint manufacture. In 2009 Pailton installed a new waste water system to handle the waste water from the machining processes. Previously the water had to be collected and disposed of off site every 6 weeks, but with the installation of the new waste water handling system, developed by the specialist Aqua-Save Technologies, this is now reduced to once every two years. In July 2010 Pailton were part of a group of companies supporting an all-British bid for the replacement of Snatch Landrovers for the British forces. As a result Pailton concentrated on military and defence vehicle applications, winning business with companies such as Force Protection Inc and Oshkosh Corporation.

Life Dorothy Frances Jebb was born 3 August 1881 in Ellesmere, Shropshire, the youngest of three sisters born to Arthur Trevor Jebb (1839-1894) and Eglantyne Louisa Jebb. Her mother's brother was the Cambridge classicist Richard Claverhouse Jebb, and Dorothy was educated at Newnham College, Cambridge.Dorothy Frances Jebb (I23268) In 1904 she married Charles Roden Buxton, at that time a Liberal politician, and the pair were active in the Liberal Party. In 1915 she joined the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. In 1917 she and her husband left the Liberal Party for the Labour Party, and joined the Society of Friends. During the First World War she compiled 'Notes from the Foreign Press' for the Cambridge Magazine. Her writing inspired the Fight the Famine Council, founded in 1918 as an effort to alleviate starvation of civilians in Germany and Austria-Hungary during the Allied blockade of Germany in World War I, which led to the Save the Children Fund, which she and her sister Eglantyne Jebb founded in 1919. In 1935, increasingly concerned at Nazi treatment of Christians in Germany, she visited Germany to see for herself.'Church and Politics: Dorothy Buxton and the German Church Struggle', in History, religion, and identity in modern Britain, Continuum International Publishing Group, 1893, pp.183-194 She secured an interview with Hermann G√∂ring to raise the issue of treatment of civilians.Clare Mulley, The Woman who Saved the Children , Oxford: Oneworld, 2009, p. xix-xx. On her return she informed George Bell, Bishop of Chicester, that German Christians whom she had met \\"seemed oppressed and bound with the apparent necessity of extreme caution\\".R. C. D. Jasper, George Bell, Bishop of Chicester, p. 205. Cited in Robbins, p. 184 Though her husband campaigned for appeasement of Germany, Dorothy Buxton became convinced that war was necessary against the Nazis. During World War II she campaigned for refugees from Nazi Germany, as well as for the welfare of German prisoners of war. She died 8 April 1963 in Peaslake, near Guildford, aged 81.

History  Founded in 1924 by Hermann Loeb in Frankfurt, Germany, originally for the publication of old master prints ‚Äì the company is named after Johann Gottlieb Prestel, the famous eighteenth- century German engraver. Paul Capellmann, a lawyer from Aachen, commandeered the company at the behest of the Nazis in 1940 and moved the offices to Munich while Loeb fled to Switzerland. After his death in 1947, Capellmann‚Äôs widow, Georgett, and Gustav Stresow took over the publishing house and expanded the programme from books on drawings and prints to include painting, architecture and photography. Gustav Stresow remained a company director until his death on 8 July 2010. J√ºrgen Tesch took over as Managing Director in 1977 and expanded the company further, especially in the area of exhibition catalogues, becoming one of the leading publishing partners in the world for museums. A further important step came when Tesch started an English-language publishing programme and set up distribution throughout the world. Today, the company has over 1,000 books in print, with more than three-quarters in English. At the start of 2005, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung took over full ownership of Prestel Verlag after having already owned a portion of the company for many years. In 2006, in order to concentrate on its key business interests, the FAZ divested all interests in book publishing and there was a management buy-out. In 2005, the FAZ sold publishers DVA, Manesse Verlag, and K√∂sel to Random House and in August 2006 it sold Prestel in equal parts to Martin Dort, Johannes Heyne and the Managing Director at the time - J√ºrgen Krieger. Dort and Heyne were at this point already owners of their own publishing companies, Christian Verlag and Frederking und Thaler. Thus, a little publishing group came into being but not for long. Random House bought Prestel in June 2008. Christian Verlag und Frederking & Thaler were sold at the same time to publishing house GeraNova Bruckmann.

He served as the fifth president of Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois from 1935 to 1962.  Early life  Conrad Bergendoff was born in Shickley, Nebraska, to Carl August and Emma Mathilda Fahlberg Bergendoff. He spent his youth in Middletown, Connecticut. He graduated from Augustana College, Rock Island, Illinois in 1915 and earned his M.A. at the University of Pennsylvania in 1916. He returned to Rock Island to complete the B. Div. degree at the [Augustana Theological Seminary. Bergendoff was ordained into the ministry of the Augustana Lutheran Synod on June 12, 1921 in Chicago.\\"The Augustana Ministerium\\" (1980). Augustana Historical Society. He pursued advanced study at Sweden's Uppsala University, serving as personal secretary to Swedish Archbishop Nathan S√∂derblom during the Stockholm Conference on Life and Work in 1925. He earned his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1928.  Career  Bergendoff became dean of the Augustana Theological Seminary in 1931, and was elected to succeed Gustav Andreen as president of Augustana College in 1935. He saw the college through the difficult years of the Great Depression, through its separation from Augustana Theological Seminary in 1948, and into a long period of substantial growth and increasing prestige. Among his most notable achievements was the ecumenical spirit he engendered in American Lutherans from the late 1930s going forward. Instrumental in gathering together the myriad branches of the European immigrant Lutheran bodies, Bergendoff used his considerable influence and power within the Augustana Synod to help unite those Swedish-background churches into the United Lutheran Church in America (1962-1987), a precursor of the current Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Bergendoff also devoted considerable attention to the ecumenical movement between major Protestant denominations, and on a more local and regional level he made many inroads towards official cooperation with leaders of conservative and reformed movements in American Judaism.

The fine arts building at Augustana College, constructed during his presidency, was named the Bergendoff Hall of Fine Arts. The Lutheran noted Bergendoff as \\"one of the most influential people in 20th-century American Lutheranism\\".  Personal life  As a young pastor in Chicago he met and married Gertrude Elizabeth Carlson of Rockford, Illinois, the daughter of Swedish immigrants. Their children were Conrad born in 1924, Beatrice born in 1928, and Elizabeth born in 1937. Bergendoff and his wife were the grandparents to nine grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.

Description The elongate-oval shell is subdiaphanous. It measures 2.1 mm. The whorls of the protoconch are small, almost completely immersed in the first post-nuclear whorl, only the rounded two-thirds of the last volution are visible, and those indicate that the axis of the nuclear turns must be at a right angle to the axis of the later whorls. The five whorls of the teleoconch are moderately well rounded, the last one somewhat inflated, shouldered. They are marked by strong, broadly rounded, subequal and subequally spaced spiral keels. These are separated by deep, rounded sulci, which are about as wide as the keels. The sulci are crossed by extremely fine and very closely spaced axial raised threads which pass up on the sides of the spiral keels, but do not cross their summits. The second and third whorls have three keels between the sutures. On the third whorl the posterior keel at the summit of the whorl, which is a little wider than the other two, shows a spiral striation on its middle. This grows gradually stronger as the shell advances, until on the penultimate whorl it has divided this keel into two, the posterior one of which is a little less developed than the anterior one, which resembles the other between the sutures. The summit of the last whorl falls considerably below the periphery, showing five spiral keels between the sutures on the penultimate whorl. The periphery of the body whorl is sulcate. The sulcus is like the rest and is similarly sculptured. The base of the shell is well rounded, somewhat attenuated anteriorly, sculptured like the spaces between the sutures, having seven spiral keels. These keels diminish somewhat in size from the periphery to the umbilical area. The aperture is subovate. The posterior angle is acute. The outer lip thin, wavy, showing the external sculpture within. The columella is decidedly curved, reinforced anteriorly by the attenuated base. It is provided with a very strong,acute, oblique fold near its insertion. The parietal wall is covered by a thin callus.Dall & Bartsch, Notes on Japanese, Indo-Pacific and American Pyramidellidae; Proceedings of the U.S. National Museum, vol XXX n¬∞ 1452; 1906 Oscilla circinata Distribution This marine species is found off Japan.

It provided diagnostic analysis of smartphones to the wireless industry via the installation of software on the user's phone, typically in a manner that cannot be removed without rooting the phone. The company says that its software is deployed in over 150 million devices worldwide.Carrier IQ Named as an Innovative Business Analytics Company Under $100M to Watch , Mountain View, CA, October 27, 2011Carrier IQ apologizes, drops threat to security researcher, by Stephen Shankland, 2011/11/25, CNET News.com Products IQ Agent is software, typically pre-installed on mobile devices by handset manufacturers or network operators, designed to gather, store and forward diagnostic measurements on their behalf. Data available can include metrics on the device itself (e.g., firmware, battery levels, application performance, web performance) and performance data on voice and data connectivity between the device and radio towers. The mobile device manufacturers or network operators determine which of these metrics are actually collected, according to a set of criteria known as a \\"profile.\\" The IQ Agent software runs in the background, and the user is not usually aware of its presence unless the implementation includes an on-off switch. IQ Agent periodically uploads data to a Carrier IQ Mobile Service Intelligence Platform (MSIP) system, which then feeds into the network operator's network performance monitoring and diagnostic tools. Whenever a mobile device uploads data, the IQ Agent can also download a new profile to change the selection of metrics gathered. IQ Agent was first shipped in 2006 on embedded feature phones and has since been implemented on numerous devices and operating systems, including smartphones (Android, RIM, iPhone), USB modems and tablets. MSIP (Mobile Service Intelligence Platform) refers to the backend Carrier IQ software that receives mobile device diagnostic data directly from mobile devices containing the IQ Agent software. The platform aggregates data from many devices and produces KPIs (key performance indicators) that network operators and mobile device manufacturers can use to assess the quality of services they provide and to troubleshoot mobile device and network problems. Analytics Domains are MSIP components that enable the system to calculate specific KPIs. Carrier IQ's first analytics domains were on CDMA signaling, later implementing UMTS (third-generation mobile cellular technology for GSM networks), LTE (a standard marketed as 4G LTE) and device-specific domains for device stability, battery and application performance. IQ Insight is a suite of applications that gathers, analyzes and presents KPIs generated by MSIP through a web-based GUI (graphical user interface). The application delivers data through a geospatial or tabular view of issues (such as dropped calls or no-service conditions) and allows cross-domain analysis of KPIs. IQ Care is a dashboard tool for network operator and mobile device customer care agents. When a mobile device user calls for support or troubleshooting, IQ Care provides the customer care agent with a dashboard showing the consumer's device configurations (e.g., mobile device serial number, firmware version), usage history (e.g., number of applications installed, battery life) and other user experience metrics (e.g., device and application crash data, radio technology analytics). History The company was founded by Konstantin Othmer and is a spin-off from his Core Mobility company. Through its MSIP its software \\"aggregates, analyzes, and delivers data to wireless carriers and device manufacturers.

Detecting Carrier IQ normally doesn't require the device to be rooted. The removal process is more advanced and requires the user to root the device, or unlock the device's boot loader (applies only on Nexus devices) in order to remove it. Rooting the device may void its warranty, since system files are modified. Updates On December 12, 2011, Carrier IQ released a document to explain their software and its uses. The document is titled \\"Understanding Carrier IQ Technology\\". There are credits given to Dan Rosenberg and Trevor Eckhart. The nineteen page document provides a technical breakdown of how the software on a mobile phone works with \\"profiles\\" provided by the carrier to give the carriers performance data of their networks and devices running on them. The document appears as if it will be updated on a regular basis as more questions are answered over time. On December 1, 2011, Carrier IQ issued a \\"clarification\\" to its November 23 statements: \\"While a few individuals have identified that there is a great deal of information available to the Carrier IQ software inside the handset, our software does not record, store or transmit the contents of SMS messages, email, photographs, audio or video. For example, we understand whether an SMS was sent accurately, but do not record or transmit the content of the SMS. We know which applications are draining your battery, but do not capture the screen... As a condition of its contracts with operators, Carrier IQ operates exclusively within that framework and under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction. The data we gather is transmitted over an encrypted channel and secured within our customers‚Äô networks or in our audited and customer-approved facilities... Carrier IQ acts as an agent for the operators. Each implementation is different and the diagnostic information actually gathered is determined by our customers ‚Äì the mobile operators. Carrier IQ does not gather any other data from devices. Carrier IQ is the consumer advocate to the mobile operator, explaining what works and what does not work. Three of the main complaints we hear from mobile device users are (1) dropped calls, (2) poor customer service, and (3) having to constantly recharge the device. Our software allows operators to figure out why problems are occurring, why calls are dropped, and how to extend the life of the battery. When a user calls to complain about a problem, our software helps operators‚Äô customer service to more quickly identify the specific issue with the phone.\\" There has been debate whether Carrier IQ software actually sends the collected data in real time or if it is stored on the phone and only gets read out later. The company clearly states on its web page that its software is able to provide real-time data: \\"Carrier IQ‚Äôs Mobile Service Intelligence solution eliminates guesswork by automatically providing accurate, real-time data direct from the source ‚Äì your customers' handsets.\\". In February 2012, TelecomTV, in association with Carrier IQ, filmed a panel discussion/debate titled, 'The Data Dilemma' and addressing the question: Do operators collect user data for the benefit of their customer or for their own commercial and financial betterment? Participants in the videotaped panel discussion were Mike Short, Vice President, Telef√≥nica Europe; Dean Bubley, Founder, Disruptive Analysis; Charlotte Patric, Principal Analyst, Gartner; and Martyn Warwick, Moderator, TelecomTV.

Analytics and Carrier IQ  left Generally speaking, analytics companies collect, synthesize, and present aggregated user information to their customers to help them reduce maintenance costs, increase revenue, and improve the performance of a particular product. Mobile analytics provide to their customers telemetry. The telemetry is important because it contains solutions related to mobile web and telephone services. For instance, if a particular application on a mobile device crashes, the logs can be sent showing specific details of the issue. It is also possible that telemetry related to mobile handset user webpage views and click behavior is also included Problems with Carrier IQ's clarification While the contents of SMS messages are kept private, as the clarification states, the simple reporting of the success or failure of an SMS transmission provides valuable information about customer habits that would not normally be available outside of the cellular network itself. Because the information is transmitted over the web on a regular basis, an internet service provider will be able see entries in the named.log file that resides on its name server at times when any user with an affected phone is connected to the internet by WiFi. This method of connecting is extremely common, as many users seek to keep their cellular data charges as low as possible by also utilizing their home or corporate wireless networks. A likely privacy violation is targeted marketing by the home or company's internet service provider. Examples of possible targeted marketing include offering competing phone plans, android apps that facilitate additional sales, such as television guides, and even hardware sales, like faster or integrated WiFi routers. In short, because of the way Carrier IQ works, even if the company acts with the best of intentions, the software betrays users by leaking information outside of the control of either Carrier IQ or the affected user's phone company. Distribution On December 1, 2011, AT&T;, Sprint, and T-Mobile confirmed it was on their phones. Sprint said, \\"We collect enough information to understand the customer experience with devices on our network and how to address any connection problems, but we do not and cannot look at the contents of messages, photos, videos, etc., using this tool... The information collected is not sold and we don't provide a direct feed of this data to anyone outside of Sprint.\\" Verizon was the only one of the four biggest U.S. firms to say it was not installed on their phones. Apple, HTC, and Samsung said the software was installed on their phones. Apple said it had quit supporting the application in iOS 5. It said, \\"With any diagnostic data sent to Apple, customers must actively opt-in to share this information... We never recorded keystrokes, messages or any other personal information for diagnostic data and have no plans to ever do so.\\" It said it would scrub the software from phones in some future release. HTC (whose Android phone was the subject of Eckhart's video) said, it was required on its devices by a \\"number of U.S. carriers.\\" It added \\"It is important to note that HTC is not a customer or partner of Carrier IQ and does not receive data from the application, the company, or carriers that partner with Carrier IQ.\\" Nokia and Research in Motion (now BlackBerry Ltd) have said Carrier IQ categorically was not authorized for their phones. According to the company's website the software is also installed on NEC mobile devices,NEC and Carrier IQ Announce Global Partner , February 17, 2009, Carrier IQ. and the company has a partnership with Vodafone Portugal.News Release: Vodafone Portugal Pioneers Innovative Mobile Broadband Experience Management Architecture Using Carrier IQ Technology , July 31, 2009, Carrier IQ. Although the phone manufacturers and carriers by and large say the software is strictly used to monitor its phone systems and not to be used by third parties, a press release on October 19, 2011 touted a partnership with Nielsen Company. The press release said, \\"Together, they will deliver critical insights into the consumer experience of mobile phone and tablet users worldwide, which adhere to Nielsen‚Äôs measurement science and privacy standards. This alliance will leverage Carrier IQ's technology platform to gather actionable intelligence on the performance of mobile devices and networks.\\"Nielsen and Carrier IQ Form Global Alliance to Measure Mobile Service Quality , October 19, 2011, Carrier IQ. Government response On December 1, 2011, Senator Al Franken, chairman of the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law sent a letter to Lenhart asking for answers to 11 questions and asking whether the company was in violation of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, including the federal wiretap statute (18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2511 et seq.), the pen register statute (18 USC ¬ß 3121 et seq.), and the Stored Communications Act (18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2701 et seq.) and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1030). A request to the FBI under the Freedom of Information Act for \\"any manuals, documents or other written guidance used to access or analyze data gathered by programs developed or deployed by Carrier IQ\\" was denied, citing pending law enforcement proceeding. This has led to speculation that the FBI is using data obtained through Carrier IQ for investigations.

Depending on the fluid in question and the context being referred to, it may also vary significantly in dimensions perpendicular to elevation as well, and these variations have relevance in the context of pressure gradient force and its effects. However, the vertical variation is especially significant, as it results from the pull of gravity on the fluid; namely, for the same given fluid, a decrease in elevation within it corresponds to a taller column of fluid weighing down on that point. Basic formula A relatively simple version of the vertical fluid pressure variation is simply that the pressure difference between two elevations is the product of elevation change, gravity, and density. The equation is as follows: : \\\\frac{dP}{dh} = - \\\\rho g , and where : is pressure, : is density, : is acceleration of gravity, and : is height. The delta symbol indicates a change in a given variable. Since is negative, an increase in height will correspond to a decrease in pressure, which fits with the previously mentioned reasoning about the weight of a column of fluid. When density and gravity are approximately constant (that is, for relatively small changes in height), simply multiplying height difference, gravity, and density will yield a good approximation of pressure difference. Where different fluids are layered on top of one another, the total pressure difference would be obtained by adding the two pressure differences; the first being from point 1 to the boundary, the second being from the boundary to point 2; which would just involve substituting the and values for each fluid and taking the sum of the results. If the density of the fluid varies with height, mathematical integration would be required. Whether or not density and gravity can be reasonably approximated as constant depends on the level of accuracy needed, but also on the length scale of height difference, as gravity and density also decrease with higher elevation. For density in particular, the fluid in question is also relevant; seawater, for example, is considered an incompressible fluid; its density can vary with height, but much less significantly than that of air. Thus water's density can be more reasonably approximated as constant than that of air, and given the same height difference, the pressure differences in water are approximately equal at any height. Hydrostatic paradox Diagram illustrating the hydrostatic paradox The barometric formula depends only on the height of the fluid chamber, and not on its width or length. Given a large enough height, any pressure may be attained. This feature of hydrostatics has been called the hydrostatic paradox. As expressed by W. H. Besant, :Any quantity of liquid, however small, may be made to support any weight, however large. The Dutch scientist Simon Stevin was the first to explain the paradox mathematically. In 1916 Richard Glazebrook mentioned the hydrostatic paradox as he described an arrangement he attributed to Pascal: a heavy weight rests on a board with area resting on a fluid bladder connected to a vertical tube with cross-sectional area Œ±. Pouring water of weight down the tube will eventually raise the heavy weight. Balance of forces leads to the equation :W = \\\\frac {w A}{\\\\alpha} . Glazebrook says, \\"By making the area of the board considerable and that of the tube small, a large weight can be supported by a small weight of water. This fact is sometimes described as the hydrostatic paradox.\\" Demonstrations of the hydrostatic paradox are used in teaching the phenomenon. In the context of Earth's atmosphere If one is to analyze the vertical pressure variation of the atmosphere of Earth, the length scale is very significant (troposphere alone being several kilometres tall; thermosphere being several hundred kilometres) and the involved fluid (air) is compressible. Gravity can still be reasonably approximated as constant, because length scales on the order of kilometres are still small in comparison to Earth's radius, which is on average about 6371 km, and gravity is a function of distance from Earth's core. Density, on the other hand, varies more significantly with height. It follows from the ideal gas law that :\\\\rho = \\\\frac{m P}{k T}, where : is average mass per air molecule, : is pressure at a given point, : is the Boltzmann constant, : is the temperature in kelvins. Put more simply, air density depends on air pressure. Given that air pressure also depends on air density, it would be easy to get the impression that this was circular definition, but it is simply interdependency of different variables. This then yields a more accurate formula, of the form :P_h = P_0 e^{-\\\\frac{mgh}{kT}}, where : is the pressure at height , : is the pressure at reference point 0 (typically referring to sea level), : is the mass per air molecule, : is gravity, : is height from reference point 0, : is the Boltzmann constant, : is the temperature in kelvins. Therefore, instead of pressure being a linear function of height as one might expect from the more simple formula given in the \\"basic formula\\" section, it is more accurately represented as an exponential function of height. Note that in this simplification, the temperature is treated as constant, even though temperature also varies with height. However, the temperature variation within the lower layers of the atmosphere (troposphere, stratosphere) is only in the dozens of degrees, as opposed to their thermodynamic temperature, which is in the hundreds, so the temperature variation is reasonably small and is thus ignored. For smaller height differences, including those from top to bottom of even the tallest of buildings, (like the CN tower) or for mountains of comparable size, the temperature variation will easily be within the single-digits. (See also lapse rate.) An alternative derivation, shown by the Portland State Aerospace Society, is used to give height as a function of pressure instead. This may seem counter-intuitive, as pressure results from height rather than vice versa, but such a formula can be useful in finding height based on pressure difference when one knows the latter and not the former. Different formulas are presented for different kinds of approximations; for comparison with the previous formula, the first referenced from the article will be the one applying the same constant-temperature approximation; in which case: :z = -\\\\frac{RT}{g} \\\\ln \\\\frac{P}{P_0} where (with values used in the article) : is the elevation, : is the specific gas constant = : is the absolute temperature in kelvins = at sea level, : is the acceleration due to gravity = , : is the pressure at a given point at elevation , and : is pressure at the reference point = at sea level. A more general formula derived in the same article accounts for a linear change in temperature as a function of height (lapse rate), and reduces to above when the temperature is constant: :z = \\\\frac{T_0}{L}\\\\left(\\\\left(\\\\frac{P}{P_0}\\\\right)^{-\\\\frac{LR}{g}} - 1\\\\right) where : is the atmospheric lapse rate (change in temperature divided by distance) = , and : is the temperature at the same reference point for which and the other quantities are the same as those above. This is the recommended formula to use.

The bridge is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building and Scheduled Monument. History The history of a bridge at Skerton is somewhat amusingly related in Cross Fleury's 1891 publication Time-Honoured Lancaster, which notes that, with the looming arrival of the Jacobites in first Rising of 1715, the people attempted to forestall a rapid occupation of the town by damaging the only link to the northern bank of the Lune (the Old Loyne Bridge), knocking the battlements off the sides of the existing bridge to its northern end. The Governors of the town had, in fact, planned to blow up the bridge but, upon being informed that the river was shallow enough to ford easily at numerous points, opted not to cause needless damage and settled for strategic demolition instead. The invading force was undeterred by this apparent effort to jeopardise their safe crossing over the water and, ironically, this partial demolition was to be the cause of numerous accidents for many years after, as travellers would occasionally lose control of their wagons and veer off the unprotected side of the bridge, the Jacobites having managed to cross without incident, in the first place. Towards the end of 18th century the Old Loyne Bridge had thereby become inadequate for its purpose. A petition was made for an Act of Parliament to allow for the building of a new bridge at a more convenient site; this was passed in June 1782. A competition was held for the design of the new bridge, which was won by Thomas Harrison, his first major commission. The first stone was laid in June 1783, and the bridge was completed in September 1787; it cost ¬£14,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). In 1839 repair and repointing of the bridge was supervised by the local architect Edmund Sharpe. An additional arch was added to the south end of the bridge in about 1849 to allow for the passage of the \\"Little\\" North Western Railway (since closed) beneath it. It continues to be used as a road bridge, and when it was examined in 1995 it was considered to be strong enough to carry vehicles weighing up to 40 tons‚Äîten times the weight of the heaviest vehicles in 1783. Architecture The bridge is constructed in sandstone ashlar. It consists of five semi-elliptical arches with piers that are articulated by aedicules formed by attached Tuscan columns supporting pediments; it has a balustraded parapet. The semi-elliptical arches allow it to have a flat road deck. Each of the five original arches spans , and the deck between the parapets is wide. There are stormwater channels in the spandrels between the arches and at the abutments. Context Skerton Bridge was the first large public bridge in England to have a flat rather than a bowed roadway. There had been earlier bridges elsewhere with this feature, for example Coldstream Bridge (1763) in Scotland, designed by John Smeaton, and a bridge at Neuilly-sur-Seine, Paris (1768‚Äì74; demolished in 1939) by Jean- Rodolphe Perronet. Harrison's design influenced John Rennie in his designs of Kelso Bridge (1803), Waterloo Bridge (1809‚Äì17), and London Bridge (1824‚Äì31).

Specifically it is used to prevent blood clots following hip or knee replacement and in those with a history of prior clots. It is used as an alternative to warfarin and does not require monitoring by blood tests. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include bleeding and nausea. Other side effects may include bleeding around the spine and allergic reactions. Use is not recommended during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Use appears to be relatively safe in those with mild kidney problems. Compared to warfarin it has fewer interactions with other medications. It is a direct factor Xa inhibitor. Apixaban was approved for medical use in the European Union in May 2011, and in the United States in December 2012. Text was copied from this source which is ¬© European Medicines Agency. Reproduction is authorized provided the source is acknowledged. In 2017, it was the 93rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States with more than eight million prescriptions. In December 2019, generic versions were approved in the United States. Medical uses Apixaban is indicated for the following: * To lower the risk of stroke and embolism in people with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. * Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prevention. DVTs may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) in knee or hip replacement surgery patients. * Treatment of both DVT and PE. * To reduce the risk of recurring DVT and PE after initial therapy. In the EU, apixaban is indicated for the prevention of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) in adults who have undergone elective hip or knee replacement surgery, the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in adults with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) with one or more risk factors, for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in adults, and for the prevention of recurrent DVT and PE in adults. Atrial fibrillation Apixaban is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and at least one of the following risk factors: prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, age 75 years or older, diabetes mellitus, or symptomatic heart failure. Apixaban and other anticoagulants (dabigatran, edoxaban and rivaroxaban) appear equally effective as warfarin in preventing non- hemorrhagic stroke in people with atrial fibrillation and are associated with lower risk of intracranial bleeding. While apixaban may be used in people with severely decreased kidney function and those on hemodialysis it has not been studied in these groups. Full dose apixaban (5 mg [bid]) can be used, unless at least two of the following characteristics apply: patient age is 80 years or older, body weight is 60 kg or less, and serum creatinine is 1.5 mg/dL or higher, in which case dose reduction to 2.5 mg bid is indicated.However, the prescription information acknowledges that \\"clinical efficacy and safety studies with Eliquis did not enroll patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on dialysis\\". Side effects Bleeding Apixaban can increase the risk of bleeding which may be serious and potentially fatal. Concurrent use with other medications that affect blood clotting can further increase this risk. This includes medications such as other anticoagulants, heparin, aspirin, antiplatelet medications, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Andexanet alfa is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved antidote for apixaban in people with uncontrolled and life- threatening bleeding events. Spinal puncture Following spinal anesthesia or puncture people who are being treated with anti-thrombotic agents are at higher risk for developing a hematoma, which can cause long-term or permanent paralysis. The risk of this may be increased by using epidural or intrathecal catheters after a surgical operation or from the concurrent use of medicinal agents that affect hemostasis. Mechanism of action Apixaban is a highly selective, orally bioavailable, and reversible direct inhibitor of free and clot-bound factor Xa. Factor Xa catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, the final enzyme in the coagulation cascade that is responsible for fibrin clot formation. Apixaban has no direct effect on platelet aggregation, but by inhibiting factor Xa, it indirectly decreases clot formation induced by thrombin.  History  Apixaban was approved for medical use in the European Union in May 2011. A new drug application (NDA) for the approval of apixaban was submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) and Pfizer jointly after conclusion of the ARISTOTLE clinical trial in 2011. Apixaban was approved for the prevention of stroke in people with atrial fibrillation on December 28, 2012. On March 13, 2014, it was approved for the additional indication of preventing deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in people who have recently undergone knee or hip replacement. On August 21, 2014, the FDA approved apixaban for the additional indication of the treatment of recurring deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. During its development the drug was known as BMS-562247-01. By late 2019, sales of the product by BMS accounted for thirty-percent of their quarterly revenue. In December 2019, the US FDA approved a generic version produced jointly by Mylan and Micro Labs.

Containing over 40 years of daily entries from 1862-1908, the diaries of Joseph Mathia Svoboda detail his life as a steamship worker on the Tigris river, his everyday affairs in the Baghdadi community, and perspectives on current events in Ottoman Iraq and the world at large.https://depts.washington.edu/svobodad/joseph.html The collection also contains a travel journal kept by Joseph's son, Alexander Richard Svoboda, while journeying overland from Baghdad to Paris as a teenager in 1897. Although only small portions of the diaries have been published thus far, the University of Washington has begun a project designed to publish the diaries in both electronic and print format, making them freely available to the public in partnership with Newbook Digital Texts in the Humanities.Newbook Digital Texts The Diaries Background The Svoboda family‚Äôs presence in Baghdad began with the immigration of Antone Svoboda (1796-1878), a Viennese crystal merchant, to the Ottoman Empire in the early 19th century. Settling in Baghdad, Antone established a business importing crystal from Bohemia and Istanbul and developed close relations with the European community and the city's local upper class. Antone married Euphemie Joseph Muradijan, a member of the local Chaldean Christian community, in 1825. Antone and Euphemie had eleven children, four of them male and seven female. The Svobodas became an established family in Baghdad, intermixing with and marrying members of the local Christian, resident European and Muslim communities for generations.The Svoboda Project History at Newbook Digital Texts The Joseph Mathia Svoboda Diaries Entry from Joseph Mathia Svoboda Diaries, noting the death of Baghdad notable Kerop Agha Kouyoumdjianhttp://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/iraqdiaries/id/2523/rec/45 Among Antone‚Äôs sons was Joseph Mathia Svoboda (1840-1908). In 1862, Joseph began working as a clerk with the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, traveling by steamship along the Tigris River between Baghdad and Basra. During this time, he began recording a daily diary that he would keep until his death in 1908. The diaries primarily concern his everyday affairs, including meticulous notes on shipments and weather conditions, as well as his personal interactions with his family and the local Christian community in Baghdad. Joseph‚Äôs diaries provide a unique vantage point for the interplay of the diverse cultures, governments, and forces of nature competing for influence in Ottoman Iraq. Roughly bookended by the start of the Tanzimat era and the Young Turk Revolution, Joseph's life in Baghdad at once reflects the rapid changes taking place in the period of the late Ottoman Empire and the immutable character of the ancient land between rivers. In her original article on the diaries, Margaret Makiya writes that Joseph's life \\"covers almost exactly the period of 'Victorian Baghdad' if we may use such a term, and the diaries reveal as much about himself and the generation to which he belonged as they do about the great empire and society through which he moved.\\".The Joseph Mathia Svoboda Diaries at Newbook Digital Texts The Alexander Richard Svoboda Travel Journal In 1897, at the age of nineteen, Joseph's son Alexander journeyed across the Middle East and Europe, keeping a journal as he went. Traveling from his frontier province of Baghdad to the modern metropolis of Paris, Alexander records his impressions of a rapidly modernizing landscape as he encounters it for the first time, provides a fresh commentary on the great changes of his day and the particularity of Baghdad's place in that world. Written in Arabic, the journal was translated by Nowf Allawi and published in collaboration with Newbook Digital Texts in 2013. In his introduction to the Newbook publication, Professor Walter G.

In the 1970s, Margaret Makiya became interested in the diaries as \\"a social document of a particular fragment of Iraqi society in the second half of the nineteenth century,\\" and obtained a grant from the Gulbenkian Foundation to study and transcribe their contents. Makiya transcribed 31 of the 61 diaries, and her work continues to serve as essential source material for the Svoboda Project. In 1985, Professor Henry Svoboda, the last member of the Svoboda family remaining in Iraq, employed researcher and architect Nowf Allawi to assist in writing a family history using material from Joseph Svoboda's diaries. In 2005 the two began work on a translation of Alexander Svoboda's travel journal, but Professor Svoboda's death in October 2005 and the continuing turmoil of the Iraq War cast doubt on the project's future. Allawi sought the assistance of University of Washington Professor Walter Andrews and the Ottoman Texts Archive Project - a collaboration which began the Svoboda Diaries Project and the development of Newbook Digital Texts in the Humanities. Alexander's travel journal was eventually published by Newbook in 2013, and the Svoboda Project continues the work of transcribing the Joseph Mathia diaries and preparing them for digital release.http://www.dailyuw.com/news/article_47ba13ca-24a4-11e7-b038-077596397ae7.html  References   External links  * Newbook Digital Texts Project * The Svoboda Diaries - Project Page * Researchworks Archive ** The Svoboda Diaries Scanned images of all original diaries in the collection. ** From Baghdad to Paris: 1897; Journal of a Journey to Europe by Land via Damascus and Beirut Category:Diaries Category:Baghdad Vilayet ","title":"Svoboda Diaries"},{"id":"33914998","text":"Chauncy School is a secondary school located in Ware, Hertfordshire in the East of England. It is the only mixed secondary school in Ware. The school pride themselves on accepting students of any ability, and has had increasingly improved results for 13 years running. In Jan 2013, OFSTED described Chauncy School as 'an inspiring and exciting place to be.' In 2017, OFSTED rated Chauncy School as outstanding. Admissions The school accept students from any ability and background. Sixth Form requires A*-C grades, but negotiations are permitted. The admissions limit for Year 7 in September 2011 was 160. Leavers 65% of year 11s in 2011 stayed in Chauncy for 6th form and 27% went on to further education. 53% of year 13s in 2011 went to University in the UK and 30% went to college.  History  Chauncy School was formed in 1982 upon the merger of two local comprehensive schools, The Trinity School (first known as Ware C of E Secondary Modern School) opened in 1961) and Fanshawe School. Dwindling class sizes had resulted in a need for the authorities to reassess Ware's schools and despite a long campaign to retain both schools, the decision was made to close the Trinity site and use the Fanshawe site. The decision was made to change the name to Chauncy as a way of unifying the town and erasing local rivalries from the two former schools. As of the beginning of the school year for 1982-83, the Fanshawe School site opened as Chauncy School. Until 1985, the old Trinity School site was kept open for pupils in the 5th and 6th forms, and then they too joined the Park Road site. In 2015 the school filed two planning applications with East Herts District Council. These included the sale of land for housing to fund the development of a new sports facility. The new sports facility was officially opened on Friday 24 February 2017. To provide additional teaching space, 8 new classrooms were included as part of the project.

One of the earliest and most prominent examples is the fractional quantum Hall effect, where the constituent particles are electrons but the quasiparticles carry fractions of the electron charge. Fractionalization can be understood as deconfinement of quasiparticles that together are viewed as comprising the elementary constituents. In the case of spin‚Äìcharge separation, for example, the electron can be viewed as a bound state of a 'spinon' and a 'chargon', which under certain conditions can become free to move separately.  History  Quantized Hall conductance was discovered in 1980, related to the electron charge. Laughlin proposed a fluid of fractional charges in 1983, to explain the fractional quantum Hall effect seen in 1982, for which he shared the 1998 Physics Nobel Prize. In 1997, experiments directly observed an electric current of one-third charge. The one-fifth charge was seen in 1999 and various odd fractions have since been detected. Disordered magnetic materials were later shown to form interesting spin phases. Spin fractionalization was seen in spin ices in 2009 and spin liquids in 2012. Fractional charges continue to be an active topic in condensed matter physics. Studies of these quantum phases impact understanding of superconductivity, and insulators with surface transport for topological quantum computers.  Physics  Many-body effects in complicated condensed materials lead to emergent properties that can be described as quasiparticles existing in the substance. Electron behavior in solids can be considered as quasi-particle magnons, excitons, holes, and charges with different effective mass. Spinons, chargons, and anyons cannot be considered elementary particle combinations. Different quantum statistics have been seen; Anyons wavefunctions gain a continuous phase in exchange: P(\\\\Psi_1\\\\rangle\\\\Psi_2\\\\rangle) = e^{i \\\\theta}\\\\Psi_2\\\\rangle\\\\Psi_1\\\\rangle It has been realized many insulators have a conducting surface of 2D quantum electron gas states.  Systems  Solitons in 1D, such as polyacetylene, lead to half charges. Spin-charge separation into spinons and holons was detected in electrons in 1D SrCuO2. Quantum wires with fractional phase behavior have been studied. Spin liquids with fractional spin excitations occur in frustrated magnetic crystals, like ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2 (herbertsmithite), and in Œ±-RuCl3. Spin ice in Dy2Ti2O7 and Ho2Ti2O has fractionalized spin freedom, leading to deconfined magnetic monopoles. They should be contrasted with quasiparticles such as magnons and Cooper pairs, which have quantum numbers that are combinations of the constituents. The most celebrated may be quantum Hall systems, occurring at high magnetic fields in 2D electron gas materials such as GaAs heterostructures. Electrons combined with magnetic flux vortices carry current. Graphene exhibits charge fractionalization. Attempts have been made to extend fractional behavior to 3D systems. Surface states in topological insulators of various compounds (e.g. tellurium alloys, antimony), and pure metal (bismuth) crystals have been explored for fractionalization signatures.

Tanner and Weems recorded the song for two record companies within five years. Neither recording was successful originally. The song became a hit for both record companies after a Charlotte, North Carolina, disk jockey played it at random in 1947. Tanner was originally hired by Weems as a vocalist; the bandleader discovered Tanner's whistling ability while the band was traveling to an engagement. Like Bing Crosby, he was able to whistle from his throat due to the muscles in his larynx. He subsequently became a featured performer as a whistler, earning the nicknames \\"Whistler‚Äôs Mother‚Äôs Boy\\", \\"The Whistling Troubador,\\" and \\"the nation‚Äôs best-known whistler\\". He began appearing in films as part of the Ted Weems Orchestra in 1936; his first film role was in The Hatfields and McCoys, and he later appeared in the movie Swing, Sister, Swing (1938) and the musical film short, Swing Frolic (1942). Weems considered Tanner's whistling important enough to his orchestra that in 1939 he insured Tanner's throat for $10,000. Besides musical whistling, he also imitated birds for Disney. After a failed attempt at running a restaurant in his native Nashville in the early 1950s, he toured with the Elmo Tanner Quartet until 1958, when he found work as a disc jockey in Florida. After working as an auto dealer in the 1960s, in the early 1970s he resumed musical activity, singing with a St. Petersburg, Florida-based quartet. Early life Tanner was born on August 8, 1904 in Nashville, Tennessee, the son of Felix Elmo Tanner and Willie Mae (n√©e) Moore. He grew up in Detroit, and moved to Memphis with his family by 1926. As a young boy, Tanner studied the violin and was successful with it until eye trouble made it difficult for him to read notes. His musical training helped Tanner to develop the ability to scan music or lyrics quickly and then either sing or whistle what he had just read. On his walk home from work, Tanner passed a cemetery each night and started whistling as he passed by. Not everyone appreciated Tanner's whistling in the evening; he was once jailed in Albuquerque, New Mexico for whistling after 10pm. A graduate of the University of Tennessee, Tanner raced automobiles and worked as a mechanic in Memphis. While performing the duties of his employment he liked to whistle and sing. One day in 1927, he had a repair job for a customer who happened to work at WMC radio. After hearing Tanner singing while working on his car, the announcer suggested Tanner audition for the radio station. His consequent on-air appearance brought a call from Paramount Records, which had offices in Chicago. Career By the late 1920s, Elmo Tanner had moved to the Chicago area and had established himself as a professional musician. Although Elmo Tanner never gained a large reputation as a singer, he was occasionally featured as such with Weems. It was as a vocalist that he made his initial recordings. He recorded a few dozen sides as a soloist for Paramount and Vocalion in 1927 through 1929.Abrams, Steven and Settlemier, Tyrone. \\"The Online Discographical Project ‚Äì Vocalion 15500 - 15999 (1926 - 1939) numerical listing\\". Retrieved April 11, 2011Abrams, Steven and Settlemier, Tyrone. \\"The Online Discographical Project ‚Äì Paramount Race Series; 12500 - 13000 (1927 - 1930)\\". Retrieved April 11, 2011 The Paramount discs appeared in the Race record series, and the Vocalion sides were likewise marketed to African Americans. His versatility was noted by Vocalion, who utilized him to provide vocals for jazz outfits such as Jimmie Noone and for more sedate recordings with the Victor Young orchestra and with organist Eddie House. Not having signed an exclusive contract with any recording company, he was able to appear on the prestigious Victor label with Nathaniel Shilkret. In 1928 he formed a duet with Fred Rose as \\"The Tune Peddlers\\" and appeared on radio stations WLS, KYW, and WBBM. While working at KYW with Rose, Tanner received an offer from Ted Weems. Weems offered a higher salary than Tanner was making at the radio station, but Tanner was hesitant because the job with Weems involved substantial travel. The KYW station manager offered to match the $50 per week salary. A few days later, Weems made a higher offer which was met by the station manager's offer to match it. This continued until only Fred Rose came to work. When he arrived, Rose told the station manager that Weems now offered Tanner $100 a week and he had accepted it. Ted Weems Orchestra and ‚ÄúHeartaches‚Äù Tanner joined the Ted Weems band as a singer in 1929 and became a prominent feature of the group. Tanner's whistling talent was unveiled by accident. In high spirits on their way to their next performance, the band members were singing, yelling and whistling on the bus. When Tanner joined in, Weems was impressed enough to add a whistling segment to one of the band's sets. Tanner whistled the Show Boat song, \\"Make Believe\\"; the audience asked for an encore. Tanner's whistling became so popular that Perry Como, another featured performer in the band, said ‚ÄúThe whistler was the whole band.‚Äù On occasion, Tanner's lips would pucker up, interfering with his whistling. Although generally noted for his graciousness as a bandleader, Weems would have fun at Tanner's expense, running him through the most difficult songs in his repertoire when he noticed Tanner was struggling. Tanner became known as \\"Whistler‚Äôs Mother‚Äôs Boy\\", \\"The Whistling Troubador,\\" and \\"the nation‚Äôs best-known whistler\\". Tanner was noted for the ease with which he hit high notes and performed trills. He had the ability to whistle while triple-tonguing, and like Bing Crosby, he was able to whistle from his throat due to the muscles in his larynx. His range was from low G to high B. Professional whistler Joel Brandon has named Tanner as a \\"top pick\\". Ted Weems considered Tanner's whistling so important to his band, he insured the musician's throat with Lloyd's of London for $10,000 in 1939. The policy provided payment for any medical expenses related to Tanner's possible inability to whistle and included payment to the holder if Tanner was unable to perform. In an era when whistling was commonly featured on popular recordings, Tanner was often confused with Fred Lowery, who was blind and worked with Horace Heidt and his Musical Knights. People would come up to Tanner and ask if it was true that he was blind. ‚ÄúOnly on Saturday night,‚Äù he would reply. When not singing or whistling, Elmo played guitar in the band. The primary purpose was evidently to show Tanner was \\"doing something\\" while keeping him in view, as it became a standard joke that the guitar he was playing had rubber bands in place of strings. Tanner began appearing in films as part of the Ted Weems Orchestra in 1936; his first film role was in The Hatfields and McCoys, In 1938 he appeared in the movie Swing, Sister, Swing with the Weems outfit. Tanner also featured with Ted Weems and his Orchestra in a 1942 musical film short, Swing Frolic. During this time period Tanner appeared on the popular radio show Beat the Band with Weems; the program ran from January 28, 1940 until February 23, 1941. Ad for Tanner and his Orchestra in The Milwaukee Journal, 1947. Tanner, Ted Weems, and the rest of his orchestra joined the Merchant Marine in 1942. At (and intermittently before) his discharge in 1944 he pursued a solo career. He headlined in various nightclubs and theaters such as Chicago's Oriental and Colosimo's and at the Orpheum in Los Angeles alongside the King Sisters and Maurice Rocco. Besides musical whistling, he also imitated birds for Disney. He continued to perform songs that were associated with Weems, such as ‚ÄúNola‚Äù. Tanner announced he would be fronting a twelve-piece band in September 1946; the band's theme was \\"Heartaches\\". He took over the Andy Anderson unit that was based in Atlanta and signed on with the William Morris Agency. His orchestra featured his whistling and vocals by Carol Bridges. However, this proved to be short-lived because of the surprise success of an old recording. =The delayed success of \\"Heartaches\\"= ‚ÄúHeartaches‚Äù, composed by Al Hoffman and John Klenner in 1931, was recorded as an unusual half-rumba, half washboard rhythm. In 1933, Victor had assigned the recording of the song to Ted Weems and his Orchestra, and wanted it recorded quickly. Weems and his band had time for only one rehearsal before recording the song. Initially, Weems did not like the song; he decided to omit the lyrics by way of having Tanner whistle instead. While running through the song at rehearsal, someone thought of trying it with a speedier tempo than initially written. It was not a large seller, and the master was filed away. In 1938, Weems was now working with Decca Records and was preparing to make another record. When someone had forgotten to assign a song for the \\"B\\" side of the record, Weems and Tanner made another recording of \\"Heartaches\\"; the Decca version was not any more successful than the Victor one had been five years earlier. In 1947, a young disk jockey in Charlotte, North Carolina who worked the overnight shift had recently received some older records which he brought to work with him. He chose one at random and put it on the turntable. Shortly after the record had finished, the radio station's telephones began ringing with people asking about the song and requesting to hear it again. By afternoon, the city's music stores were calling the radio station, hoping to learn where they could order copies of \\"Heartaches\\". Both Victor and Decca went into their vaults to find their masters of the record and began pressing them for southern United States sales. As disk jockeys in other parts of the US began obtaining copies of the record and playing it, the demand for \\"Heartaches\\" went from coast to coast. This older recording went to the top of all the main charts in 1947, including sales, juke box play, and airplay. Unusually, two separate recordings were given equal credit in the charts. Victor's version was recorded on August 4, 1933 and issued on Bluebird B5131. Decca's recording was made on August 23, 1938 and originally appeared on catalog number 2020B. The hit records were credited to RCA Victor 20-2175 and Decca 25017, respectively. Altogether the recordings were credited with selling 8.5 million copies. Tanner said in a 1960 interview that neither he nor Ted Weems received any compensation for the \\"Heartaches\\" re-issue as they both had let the contracts on the song expire while they were in the Merchant Marine. Tanner and Weems missed collecting an estimated $250,000 in royalties because of the expired contracts. Because of the renewed success of ‚ÄúHeartaches‚Äù, Tanner joined the re-formed Weems outfit in March 1947, and both were signed to Mercury Records. This later outfit often received poor reviews, with the exception of Elmo's ‚Äúoutstanding‚Äù whistling; it was Tanner's whistling that audiences most responded to.Billboard, March 13, 1948, p. 33. Tanner made one more recording of \\"Heartaches\\" in 1953 with Billy Vaughn for Dot Records. Later life Tanner left Weems in 1950; in 1953, he opened a restaurant in Nashville. This occupied him for a year and a half, but it proved to be a failure and Tanner suffered financially. He formed the Elmo Tanner Quartet and resumed touring for the next few years, until, tired of travel, he broke up his group in Seattle in 1958. He spent the next fourteen months in Birmingham as a disk jockey and leading a musical combo. He reunited briefly with Weems, then settled in the St. Petersburg, Florida area in Treasure Island. Tanner's radio career began at WSGN in Birmingham with an overnight radio show called \\"Night Owl\\"; he was also on the air at WCOA (AM) in Pensacola, Florida. In 1959, Tanner began working as a disk jockey on radio station WILZ in St. Pete Beach, Florida, a position which lasted several years. During this time he continued to make recordings with orchestras such as David Carroll and Billy Vaughn to continued positive reviews.Edwards, David; Callahan, Mike; Watts, Randy; and Eyries, Patric. \\"Both Sides Now- Mercury Album Discography, Part 7: Early Stereo Releases\\". December 26, 2008. Retrieved April 11, 2011 His association continued with Weems, making the occasional guest appearance with the band he was closely connected to. In the early 1960s, Tanner was also selling Datsuns at a local St. Petersburg auto dealership. In the early 1970s he resumed musical activity, singing with a St. Petersburg-based quartet. Personal life and death In 1936, while Tanner was living in Chicago, he was divorced from his first wife, Verne. Tanner married Eleanor Jones of Birmingham on January 31, 1939 in Indianapolis. While playing an engagement with Weems, Tanner got his marriage license between the first and second acts on the bill, bought a wedding ring between the second and third acts and was married between the third and fourth acts. He met his second wife while working with the Weems band on Catalina Island. They had four children together: Elmo Jr., twins Margaret and Patricia, and John Emmet. By 1969 he was retired. Tanner underwent gall bladder surgery in 1985 and was able to recover at his home in St. Petersburg. He died on December 20, 1990 in St. Petersburg, Florida. Tanner is buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery, Nashville, Tennessee. He was posthumously inducted into the Whistlers' Hall of Fame in 1991, joining previous inductees Bing Crosby and Fred Lowery.

In a career that lasted from 1879 to 1881 he ran eleven times and won nine races. He was the leading three-year-old colt in Europe in 1880 when his wins included the Grand Prix de Paris in France and the St Leger and the Cesarewitch in England. He had a notable rivalry with the Duke of Westminster's colt Bend Or, winning three of their five racecourse meetings. Robert the Devil was regarded by contemporary observers as one of the greatest horses of the 19th century. He had limited success at stud and died in 1889. Background Robert the Devil was a big, \\"slashing\\" bay horse standing 16.2 hands high,. He was by far the best horse sired by Bertram, a useful sprinter who won the King's Stand Stakes in 1872. Robert the Devil's dam, Cast Off, had been barren for several years before being covered by Bertram and had been living semi-wild on the Cambridgeshire fens, near Soham. He was bred by Charles Brewer, a well-known bookmaker and was trained by Charles Blanton at Upper Station Road, Newmarket, Suffolk. Brewer sold a half share in the colt to Blanton, and the pair owned him in partnership, although Brewer was usually listed as his official owner. Racing career 1879: two-year-old season Robert the Devil was unbeaten in two races as a two-year-old. His more significant win came on his debut at Goodwood in late July, when he beat Dora and Edelweiss in a Rous Memorial Stakes valued at ¬£2,067 He did not reappear until the autumn when he won the ¬£212 First October Stakes at Newmarket. He attracted enough attention to go into the winter break as a leading contender for the following year's Epsom Derby, being the 8/1 second favourite behind Bend Or. 1880: three-year-old season =Spring= Robert the Devil continued to attract support for the Derby, being a popular choice among professional gamblers and on 6 March his odds were reported as 100/15 (approximately 6.7-1). Robert the Devil made his first appearance of the season in a ¬£575 Biennial Stakes at Newmarket on April 13 for which he started odds-on favourite against eight opponents. Ridden by Tom Cannon, he was beaten a head by Apollo, to whom he was conceding four pounds, after a \\"very exciting race\\" with the pair finishing well clear. The defeat caused his odds for the Derby to drift out to 100/8 (12.5-1). =Summer= In the Derby on 26 May he started at 7/1 in a field of nineteen, with Bend Or being made the 2-1 favourite. The race, which was run on very firm ground, attracted the customary huge crowd. Among those in attendance many MPs, as Parliament was adjourned for the day despite the fierce objections of one member, Sir Wilfrid Lawson, who denounced the sport as \\"rascality and roguery\\". After a delay caused by the crowd overflowing onto the racecourse, Robert the Devil broke quickly and was sent into the lead by his jockey, Rossiter, with a mile to travel. He led the field down the hill and into the straight as several challengers emerged and then dropped away, and entering the final furlong he had a commanding lead and looked the likely winner. Fred Archer on Bend Or however, had been making gradual progress and sent his colt up to join the leader in the closing stages. Robert the Devil responded with a \\"brilliant effort\\", but at the line the favourite prevailed by a head after a \\"magnificent\\" finish. It was widely agreed that the riding of Archer on the winner was the main difference between the colts. Following the race, \\"much excitement\\" was caused when an objection was lodged against the winner on the grounds that he was ‚Äúnot the horse he was represented to be‚Äù and that all his race entries were therefore not valid. This resulted from rumours that Bend Or had been accidentally switched with another colt named \\"Tadcaster\\" as a yearling at the Duke of Westminster's stud. The affair was described as the biggest scandal in racing since the \\"Running Rein\\" affair of 1844, when a four-year-old had been illegally entered in the Derby. The objection was rejected after a ten-day private hearing. Shortly after his defeat at Epsom, Robert was sent to France for the 3000m Grand Prix de Paris, the most valuable race run in continental Europe. At Longchamp on 6 June he started 4/6 favourite against eight French colts for the ¬£4,000 race. Rossiter tracked the leaders and turned into the straight in fifth place before accelerating smoothly past his rivals and winning very easily by a length from Le Destrier with Milan third. Robert the Devil's owners donated ¬£200 from their winnings to the poor of Paris. Robert the Devil was then sent to Newmarket in July for the Midsummer Stakes in which for which he started 4/11 favourite. The filly Cipolata (receiving eleven pounds) was allowed to establish a clear lead before accelerating inside the last quarter mile and although Robert the Devil reduced the margin in the closing stages, he was still half a length behind at the finish. =Autumn= On September 15 Robert the Devil started 4/1 second favourite in a field of twelve for the St Leger at Doncaster with Bend Or the 5/4 favourite. The race was run in exceptionally wet and muddy conditions, but attracted a good attendance. Tom Cannon tracked the leaders on Robert the Devil before challenging Bend Or for the lead in the straight. He \\"shot clear\\" to win easily by three lengths from Cipolata, with Bend Or finishing sixth. His owners were reported to have taken ¬£80,000 in winning bets on the race. On September 28 Robert the Devil and Bend Or met for the third time in the Great Foal Stakes at Newmarket. Robert the Devil was made favourite and attempted to make all the running. Inside the final furlong he was headed by the Derby winner, but came back in the final strides to win an \\"intensely exciting\\" race by a short head. In the two and a quarter mile Cesarewitch \\"the greatest of English handicaps\\" he was originally assigned a weight of 116 pounds, but this was increased to 118 after his win in the St Leger. On October 12 he started at odds of 17/2 in a field of twenty-one. Cannon settled the colt in the early stages before moving through to take the lead inside the last quarter mile and pulled clear to win \\"in a canter\\" by four lengths from Cipolata (104), setting a weight-carrying record for a three-year-old. Two days after his handicap win he met Bend Or yet again in the Champion Stakes. Rossiter was under instructions to lead from start (\\"make every post a winning one\\") and Robert the Devil produced a performance which \\"astounded\\" the crowd, running away from his rivals to win by ten lengths. The winning time was 2:10.00, an exceptional one for the date. At the end of the year, Robert the Devils's owners put him up for sale, but the reserve price of ¬£15,000 was not met. 1881: four-year-old season Robert the Devil's 1881 campaign began with an anti-climax as no owner entered a horse to oppose him in the Rosebery Plate at Newmarket, allowing him to walk over to claim the prize money. On June 3,at the Derby meeting, Robert the Devil met Bend Or for the fifth time in the Epsom Gold Gup, over the Derby distance of one and a half miles. The Derby winner was in good form, having produced an impressive weight-carrying performance to win the City and Suburban Handicap in April. With other intended runners dropping out the race became a match, attracting extraordinary interest and provoking unprecedented scenes of excitement. Robert the Devil set off in front, and Archer followed close behind on Bend Or. Approaching the final furlong, Archer made his move, sending Bend Or into the lead. On this occasion, Robert the Devil could not respond and Bend Or appeared to have won rather more easily than the neck margin suggested. At Royal Ascot in June, Robert the Devil ran twice. On 15 June he ran in the Gold Cup over two and a half miles, in which his opponents included the 1880 2000 Guineas winner Petronel and the American-bred three-year-old Foxhall who had recently won the Grand Prix de Paris. Robert the Devil took the lead entering the straight and drew clear to win very easily by five lengths from Petronel. Two days later at the same meeting he won the Alexandra Plate over three miles. Robert the Devil did not race again and his retirement was announced in the autumn. Assessment In May 1886 The Sporting Times carried out a poll of one hundred racing experts to create a ranking of the best British racehorses of the 19th century. Robert the Devil was ranked tenth, having been placed in the top ten by thirty-one of the contributors (Bend Or finished 22nd). Robert the Devil earned ¬£18,970 in 1880. His class and consistency made him \\"the most popular horse to have run at Newmarket for many years.\\" At the end of his three-year-old season he was acclaimed as \\"the best three-year-old we have seen for many a year.\\" Stud career Robert the Devil went to stud with a valuation of ¬£9,000 and stood ar a fee of ¬£50. He had limited success at stud. His best runners included Chittabob (Champagne Stakes), El Diablo (Lowther Stakes) and Van Dieman's Land (third in Epsom Derby). Robert the Devil died in spring 1889 at Beenham stud in Berkshire. After his death, Robert the Devil was stuffed and is still on display at Gibson's saddlery in Newmarket.http://www.ownerbreeder.co.uk/2011/05/tony-morris- may-2011/http://www.tbheritage.com/TurfHallmarks/Graves/GraveMattersFarmEUROPE.html Pedigree References Category:1877 racehorse births Category:1889 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in the United Kingdom Category:Racehorses trained in the United Kingdom Category:Thoroughbred family 1-a Category:St Leger winners ","title":"Robert the Devil (horse)"},{"id":"33915246","text":"George Alexander Spater (May 3, 1909 ‚Äì June 14, 1984) was chairman of American Airlines from 1968 until 1973, when he became the first of several corporate executives to voluntarily admit having made illegal corporate contributions to President Nixon's re-election campaign. After retiring from American Airlines, he wrote well-regarded biographies of Virginia Woolf and William Cobbett. Early life He was born in Detroit, Michigan, graduated from the University of Michigan in 1930 with an A.B. degree magna cum laude. He was associated with the Michigan Daily there.

The title Ceremony is based upon the oral traditions and ceremonial practices of the Navajo and Pueblo people. Plot Ceremony follows a half-Pueblo, half-white man named Tayo after his return from World War II. His white doctors say he is suffering from \\"battle fatigue,\\" which would be called post-traumatic stress disorder today. In addition to Tayo's story in the present, the novel flashes back to his experiences before and during the war. A parallel story tells of a time when the Pueblo nation was threatened by a drought as punishment for listening to a practitioner of \\"witchery\\"; to redeem the people, Hummingbird and Green Bottle Fly must journey to the Fourth World to find Reed Woman. Tayo is struggling with the death of his cousin Rocky during the Bataan Death March, and the loss of his uncle Josiah, who died on the Pueblo while Tayo was at war. After several years at a military hospital, Tayo is released by his doctors, who believe he will do better at home. While staying with his family, Tayo can barely get out of bed, and self-medicates with alcohol. His fellow veterans Harley, Leroy, Pinkie, and Emo drink with him, discussing their disappointment from fighting in a white man's war and having nothing to show for it. It is revealed that Tayo once stabbed Emo with a broken bottle because Emo was bragging about taking the teeth of a slain Japanese soldier. Meanwhile, the Laguna Pueblo reservation is suffering from a drought, an event which mirrors the myth. Looking to help Tayo, his grandmother summons a medicine man named Ku'oosh. However, Ku'oosh's ceremony is ineffective against Tayo's battle fatigue because Ku'oosh can't understand modern warfare. He sends Tayo to another medicine man named Betonie, who incorporates elements of the modern world into his ceremonies. Betonie tells Tayo about the Destroyers who are bent on destabilizing the world, and says that Tayo must complete the ceremony to save the Pueblo people. Believing that he bears responsibility for the drought, Tayo sets out to keep a promise he made to Josiah to round up Josiah's stolen cattle. While riding south after the cattle, he meets a woman named Ts'eh, whom he sleeps with for a night. He eventually finds the cattle on the property of a wealthy white rancher. Tayo cuts through the ranch fence, but is discovered by the ranch's employees. The tracks of a huge cougar -- heavily implied to be a form of Ts'eh -- distract them, and Tayo escapes. Ts'eh and her brother help Tayo trap the cattle in an arroyo so he can drive them back to the pueblo. The next year, Tayo reunites with Ts'eh, and spends an idyllic time with her until Tayo's drinking buddies return for him. After a night of drinking, Tayo realizes he cannot complete the ceremony while drunk, and abandons the others after sabotaging their truck. Later that night, Emo tortures Harley near the site of the Trinity nuclear test, trying to lure Tayo out to settle their score. In contrast to their past confrontation, Tayo decides not to fight. A fight ensues among the other men that results in the deaths of Harley and Leroy. Tayo goes back home to the pueblo and tells the elders he has completed the ceremony by recovering the cattle, abstaining from violence, and meeting a spirit woman in the form of Ts'eh. Meanwhile, in the mythic parallel story, Hummingbird and Green Bottle Fly find Reed Woman in the Fourth World. In each storyline, the act of ceremonial reunion brings an end to the drought, and the Pueblo are saved. Emo is banned from the reservation after killing Pinkie, and Tayo lives a content life tending to his herd of cattle.

The novel weaves together a number of different timelines and stories throughout. Apart from the function of storytelling words are very important for the Laguna oral tradition. The responsibility of humans is to tell stories, because words do not exist alone, they need a story. (229). Betonie and Tayo's grandmother tell various stories and therefore fulfill this responsibility. The significance and the power of words are emphasized by Tayo cursing the rain with words and by the following appearance of the drought (230). Based on the Spiderwoman one can also see how powerful words and thoughts are. The Spiderwoman is a mystical creature who set the world and whatever she says or thinks appears (Preface). When she vocalizes her thoughts and by doing so names things, they become reality (230). Through storytelling myths are handed down and they teach the history of the Laguna people and how they live (71). They also connect the past with the present (71), because myths are old and when they are being told, they become a part of the present.  Ceremony and healing  The purpose of ceremonies is the transformation of someone from one condition to another (71) as in Tayo's case the transformation from diseased to healing. Ceremonies are ritual enactments of myths (71) which incorporate the art of storytelling and the myths and rituals of the Native Americans (70). They are important for Tayo's identity construction as one can see through his mental development after his experience with Betonie and the ceremony (144). In the novel ‚Äúhealing‚Äù means the recovery of the self and the return to the roots (45) and one important part of the process of healing is rejecting witchery (54). Tayo rejects witchery when he refuses to drink alcohol his friends offer him (144). He does not only refuse to drink alcohol, he also distances himself from his old friends and a life full of violence. The search for the Laguna culture and its rituals also helps him to deal with turning away from witchery (54). He respects the rituals of his culture by being open for the ceremonies which is another important aspect for his healing (54). Tayo is being taught spirituality by Betonie, this way he internalizes the Laguna culture (133). It is important that the Laguna community, e.g. his aunt, who tells Tayo to go to Betonie, helps Tayo with his healing, because that way Tayo can overcome the alienation he feels caused by him being half-breed. Betonie also helps Tayo to recover through ceremonies which relates Tayo's American identity to his Laguna identity and therefore combines his past with his present (150). The fact that Tayo learns more about and experiences ceremonies is another important aspect which leads him to healing, because he learns about his culture. The appreciation of the Laguna culture is essential for his healing. He still needs a spiritual ceremony after the white man's medicine, which indicates that he needs to experience his old and his new culture (53). When Tayo covers the deer's dead body at the deer-hunting, which is a gesture performed out of respect, he shows that he initiated Laguna myths, because Laguna mythology connects all living creatures (48). After the ceremony Tayo's dreams no longer haunt him, because he learns to deal with his past and he is able to link the American to the Laguna culture (151). The cattle function as spirit guides, which leads him to healing (374), because through them he learns to forgive himself for the drought (376).  Native/Ethnic Identity  The identity of the protagonist Tayo is influenced by his ethnicity. Tayo is described as ‚Äúhalf-breed‚Äù because, in contrast to his mother, who is a Native American woman, his father is white and does not belong to the Laguna community. His father left the family and Tayo and his mother were supported by his aunt and her husband. The Laguna community in which he has grown up segregates him and he experiences despair for not being fully Native American (71). That he is not trained or educated in the Laguna way of life supports this fact (71). Therefore, Tayo struggles between white and Native American culture and he feels like not belonging to any culture at all. The Laguna people believe that every place, object, landscape or animal relates to stories of their ancestors (2). To develop this cultural identity it is important to take care of the land and the animals. By taking care of the cattle Tayo begins to take a more active and creative role in relations to nature and to his people which supports development of his cultural identity (248). On top of that the cattle function as a symbol for being alienated and different, because they are a mix of different breeds, as well. This is described as positive because the ‚Äúhalf-breed‚Äù cattle are, like Tayo, strong, robust, and can survive hard times. Therefore, they can be seen as a leitmotif for surviving (367). Moreover, the city of Gallup represents the struggle of American and Native identity. As being a former Native American city, which was built on Native American territory, Gallup changed into a city that relies on the ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù tourism industry. The white Americans suppress the real presence of Native Americans and push them to the borders of the city (491). The Native Americans who lived in the city of Gallup and felt related to the land were pushed back to a specific zoning place under the bridge to divide them from the white civilization (265). They use the former image of the city to attract tourists and make profit. Now only ethnically mixed outcasts live there (265). As Tayo states: ‚ÄúI saw Navajos in torn jackets, standing outside the bar. There were Zunis and Hopis there, too, even a few Lagunas.‚Äù (98).  Military Service and Trauma  Serving in the war as an American soldier also enhances Tayo's identity struggle. When he was in the war, he represented the United States, but by returning to his hometown he feels invisible as an American and drifts in time and space (132). By laying down the uniform of an American soldier, Tayo, and also the other Native American veterans, are not recognized as Americans anymore. This is underlined by the funeral of Tayo's friends Harley and Leroy. Tayo and his friends struggle to shape their identity between two different sorts of signifying realms, one the \\"official\\" American identity (signified by the flag) and the other, that of the erased Native American (signified by the corpse) ( 490). Furthermore, he has a trauma from war and feels responsible for the death of his cousin Rocky. Development Silko began early work on Ceremony while living in Ketchikan, Alaska, in 1973 after moving there with her children, Robert and Kazimir, from Chinle, Arizona. The family relocated so her then-husband John Silko could assume a position in the Ketchikan legal services office. Silko held a contract with Viking Press to produce a collection of short stories or a novel under editor Richard Seaver. Having no interest in creating a novel, Silko began work on a short story set in the American Southwest revolving around the character Harley and the comical exploits of his alcoholism. During this early work, the character Tayo appeared as a minor character suffering from \\"battle fatigue\\" upon his return from World War II. The character fascinated Silko enough to remake the story with Tayo as the narrative's protagonist. The papers from this early work are held at the Yale University library. In February 1974, Silko took a break from writing Ceremony to assume the role of a visiting writer at a middle school in Bethel, Alaska. It was during this time Silko penned the early work on her witchery poetry featured in Ceremony, wherein she asserts that all things European were created by the words of an anonymous Tribal witch. This writing plays a formidable role in the novel's theme of healing. An expanded version of this work is featured in Storyteller. The poetic works found in Ceremony were inspired by the Laguna oral tradition and the work of poet James Wright, with whom Silko developed a friendship after they met at a writer's conference at Grand Valley State University in June 1974, and years of written correspondence. These letters would be featured in the work The Delicacy and Strength of Lace edited by Ann Wright, wife of James Wright, and published in November 1985 after the poet's death. Silko completed the manuscript to Ceremony in July 1975 shortly before returning to New Mexico.  Reception  Ceremony has been well received by readers, and received significant attention from academics, scholars, and critics. It is widely taught in university courses, as part of American Indian studies, American studies, history, religious studies, and literature courses. Poet Simon J. Ortiz has lauded Ceremony as a \\"special and most complete example of affirmation and what it means in terms of Indian resistance.\\" Denise Cummings, Critical Media & Cultural Studies professor at Rollins College, has described Ceremony as a novel which \\"immediately challenges readers with a new epistemological orientation while altering previously established understandings of the relationship between reader and text.\\" Silko received the American Book Award for Ceremony in 1980.

Enshrined kami The primary kami of Masumida Jinja is , who appears in the Kujiki as a descendant of Amaterasu, and the ancestor of the Owari clan, the prehistoric rulers of the area. History The date of Masumida Shrine's foundation is unknown. Shrine tradition and the Kujiki records give the unlikely date of 628 BC, or the third day of the third month of the 33rd year in the reign of Emperor Jimmu. Another tradition gives the date of foundation to the reign of the semi- legendary Emperor Suinin (97 BC ‚Äì 30 BC). The shrine is located near the site of the provincial capital of Owari Province, established in the Nara period and features in the Yamato Takeru myth cycle. During the early Heian period, it appears in the Engishiki records. It has been styled as the ichinomiya of Owari Province since at least the end of the Heian period. In 1584, after the shrine was damaged by an earthquake, it was rebuilt by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. It was subsequently supported by the Tokugawa shogunate and Owari Domain until the end of the Edo period. After the Meiji Restoration, the shrine was classed as a Kokuhei Ch≈´sha (2nd rank National Shrine) under State Shinto in 1875.Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1959). The Imperial House of Japan, pp. 125. The shrine was destroyed in the Ichinomiya air raid of 1945 and was not rebuilt until 1951, with reconstruction taking ten years.

History The theater was founded in 1893 as the Harburg city theater of what was then the independent city of Harburg (Elbe). During the construction, parts of the previously burnt down Oldenburgische Staatstheater were used. The house on Kerschensteiner Strause was destroyed in 1944 in the World War II bombings. A sports hall was built in the same place in 1961. After the war ended in 1945, Hans Fitze took over the management of the St√§dtische B√ºhne Harburg. When the city of Hamburg decided not to finance the theater any more, Fitze directed the stage as a private theater starting in 1949. While successfully managing the theater, Hans Fitze also took over the management of the Altona Theater in 1954. Both theaters experienced financial problems and closed in 1994. From 1995 to 2003, the Harburg Theater was performed by the Stadttheater L√ºneburg.

It was the first public opera house to be established in Germany: not a court opera, as in many other towns. Everybody could buy a ticket, like in Venice. Most works were in the German language or translated librettos (from Italian). The building was torn down in 1756, but rebuilt in 1765. History Hamburg was a rich city and hardly affected by the Thirty Years' War. The founding of the Hamburg opera was an initiative of the well-traveled lawyer and alderman Gerhard Schott, who was impressed by Italian opera and Johann Adam Reincken, a local church organist.Jaacks, G.

Johann Theile, Kapellmeister of Christian Albert, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, who lived during the years 1675-1679 and 1684-1689 in exile in the city, organised its first performance. For the construction of the stage the Italian engineer and architect Girolamo Sartorio was attracted by the private company.Wendt, J.R.M. (2002) Materialien zur Geschichte der fr√ºhen Hamburger Oper, p. 21-22 Protests and accusations by some Hamburg ministers before and after the opening held on for several years, and is known as the first \\"Hamburger Theaterstreit\\". The opening of the house took place on 2 January 1678 with Johann Theile's sacred opera Adam und Eva, succeeded by works of Nicol√≤ Minato and Antonio Sartorio, Johann Wolfgang Franck with Cara Mustapha (1686), Agostino Steffani, Carlo Pallavicino and Johann Sigismund Kusser.Dean, W. & J.M. Knapp (1995) Handel's Operas 1694-1726, p. 42. Because of an argument with the management, Kusser organized an opera in the refectory of the local Dom. In 1695 Reinhard Keiser took over the post of Kapellmeister until 1718; from 1703 to 1707 he also held the directorship. In 1703 Handel came from Halle to Hamburg as a cembalist and violin player, and a famous duel took place between Handel and Mattheson, during and after which Cleopatra was performed. One of the musicians was Christoph Graupner. In 1705 (?) Handel met with Gian Gastone de' Medici, who invited him to Pratolino. Agostino Steffani, Johann Mattheson, Georg Friedrich H√§ndel, Nicolaus Adam Strungk, Johann Philipp F√∂rtsch, Georg Bronner, Johann Philipp Krieger, Georg Caspar Sch√ºrmann, and Johann Georg Conradi composed Singspiele or baroque opera's for the Hamburg opera. There were performances on two or three days a week, and around 90 performances a year. The opera season started in Winter; in Summer and on religious holidays the theatre was closed. Because of the long scene changes each performance took four to six hours and began by afternoon. In 1722 Georg Philipp Telemann took over the management of the opera house, which he held until the end of 1738. In 1627 the first German opera \\"Dafne\\" (lost) by Heinrich Sch√ºtz was performed. From 1743 till 1750 the building was used by Angelo Mingotti, performing Italian opera's by Johann Adolph Hasse and Pergolesi.Marx, H.J. & D.

As well as counting the number of inhabitants, respondents were also asked about their sex, age, marital status, occupation and religion. Between 1860 and 2000, a census took place every ten years in December. The only exceptions to this 10-year rhythm were the population census of 1888 (brought forward as the basis for the revision of the constituency boundaries) and the population census of 1941 (delayed due to the mobilisation of the army in May 1940). The census of 2000 was the last to use traditional methods. Since 2010, the population census has been carried out and analysed annually in a new format by the Federal Statistical Office (FSO). In order to ease the burden on the population, the information is primarily drawn from population registers and supplemented by sample surveys. Only a small proportion of the population (about 5%) are surveyed in writing or by telephone. The first reference day for the new census was 31 December 2010.  The new census  The new census The new census is primarily based on a register survey that evaluates existing administrative data. To this end, the FSO uses cantonal and communal population registers, federal registers of persons and the Federal Register of Buildings and Dwellings. Information that is not recorded in any register has to be collected by means of additional sample surveys (structural survey, thematic surveys, omnibus surveys).  Register survey  The Register survey provides basic information about the entire population. It furnishes results on the size and structure of the population and of households, as well as of residential buildings and dwellings. The results are available each year at the end of August (population statistics, buildings and dwellings statistics) or at the beginning of the year following the survey (household statistics, housing conditions).  Structural survey  Since 2010, for the Structural Survey 200,000 people (or 2.5 % of population) are surveyed in writing each year. Cantons and cities can enlarge the sample for their area. The survey provides additional statistical information (about language and religion) on the structure of the population and thus complements the information in the registers. Data are extrapolated to obtain statistical results for the whole population (aged 15 years and older). These are estimates subject to a certain degree of uncertainty. Facts that can affect the accuracy of these estimates are: the consistency of the variables recorded, the size and structure of the sample as well as the willingness of the persons interviewed to answer the questions (response rate). By merging or cumulating samples (pooling) from several years it is possible to get more accurate results than those obtained from one single sample.  Thematic surveys  For the thematic surveys, 10,000 or 40,000 people are surveyed each year on one of a total of five themes.2010: Mobility and transport; 2011: Education and training; 2012: Health; 2013: Families and generations; 2014: Language, religion and culture; 2015: Mobility and transport again The statistics from these surveys can be used to add considerable depth to the information from the structural survey. The first results are available one year after the collection of data from the respondents has been concluded.  Omnibus  Omnibus surveys are surveys on current topics2010: Internet use; 2011: People, environment, physical activity in which 3000 persons are asked to provide quick answers to current questions of interest to policymakers and the scientific and research community. The results are available about six months after the survey.

The development of these arts roughly follows the history of Mexico, divided into the prehispanic Mesoamerican era, the colonial period, with the period after Mexican War of Independence, the development Mexican national identity through art in the nineteenth century, and the florescence of modern Mexican art after the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920). Mesoamerican art is that produced in an area that encompasses much of what is now central and southern Mexico, before the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire for a period of about 3,000 years from Mexican Art can be bright and colourful this is called encopended. During this time, all influences on art production were indigenous, with art heavily tied to religion and the ruling class. There was little to no real distinction among art, architecture, and writing. The Spanish conquest led to 300 years of Spanish colonial rule, and art production remained tied to religion‚Äîmost art was associated with the construction and decoration of churches, but secular art expanded in the eighteenth century, particularly casta paintings, portraiture, and history painting. Almost all art produced was in the European tradition, with late colonial-era artists trained at the Academy of San Carlos, but indigenous elements remained, beginning a continuous balancing act between European and indigenous traditions.Paz, 1987 p.301. After Independence, art remained heavily European in style, but indigenous themes appeared in major works as liberal Mexico sought to distinguish itself from its Spanish colonial past. This preference for indigenous elements continued into the first half of the 20th century, with the Social Realism or Mexican muralist movement led by artists such as Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Jos√© Clemente Orozco, and Fernando Leal, who were commissioned by the post-Mexican Revolution government to create a visual narrative of Mexican history and culture. The strength of this artistic movement was such that it affected newly invented technologies, such as still photography and cinema, and strongly promoted popular arts and crafts as part of Mexico's identity. Since the 1950s, Mexican art has broken away from the muralist style and has been more globalized, integrating elements from Asia, with Mexican artists and filmmakers having an effect on the global stage. Pre-Columbian art Yucat√°n A Maya mural at Bonampak, 8th century AD. It is believed that the American continent's oldest rock art, 7500 years old, is found in a cave on the peninsula of Baja California.Descubierta en una cueva de M√©xico la pintura rupestre m√°s Antigua de Am√©rica / EL MUNDO The pre- Hispanic art of Mexico belongs to a cultural region known as Mesoamerica, which roughly corresponds to central Mexico on into Central America,Rosas Volume 1, p.4. encompassing three thousand years from 1500 BCE to 1500 CE generally divided into three eras: Pre Classic, Classic and Post Classic.Rosas Volume 1, p.11. The first dominant Mesoamerican culture was that of the Olmecs, which peaked around 1200 BCE. The Olmecs originated much of what is associated with Mesoamerica, such as hieroglyphic writing, calendar, first advances in astronomy, monumental sculpture (Olmec heads) and jade work.Paz, 1987 p.38. They were a forerunner of later cultures such as Teotihuacan, north of Mexico City, the Zapotecs in Oaxaca and the Mayas in southern Mexico, Belize and Guatemala. While empires rose and fell, the basic cultural underpinnings of the Mesoamerica stayed the same until the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. These included cities centered on plazas, temples usually built on pyramid bases, Mesoamerican ball courts and a mostly common cosmology. Female figurines from the Tlatilco culture, 1250 to 800 BCE. While art forms such as cave paintings and rock etchings date from earlier, the known history of Mexican art begins with Mesoamerican art created by sedentary cultures that built cities, and often, dominions. While the art of Mesoamerica is more varied and extends over more time than anywhere else in the Americas, artistic styles show a number of similarities.Rosas Volume 1, p.9. Unlike modern Western art, almost all Mesoamerican art was created to serve religious or political needs, rather than art for art's sake. It is strongly based on nature, the surrounding political reality and the gods. Octavio Paz states that \\"Mesoamerican art is a logic of forms, lines, and volumes that is as the same time a cosmology.\\" He goes on to state that this focus on space and time is highly distinct from European naturalism based on the representation of the human body. Even simple designs such as stepped frets on buildings fall into this representation of space and time, life and the gods.Paz, 1987 p.41. An aztec turquoise serpent chest ornament. At the British Museum. Art was expressed on a variety of mediums such as ceramics, amate paper and architecture. Most of what is known of Mesoamerican art comes from works that cover stone buildings and pottery, mostly paintings and reliefs. Ceramics date from the early the Mesoamerican period. They probably began as cooking and storage vessels but then were adapted to ritual and decorative uses. Ceramics were decorated by shaping, scratching, painting and different firing methods.Rosas Volume 1, p.12. Turquoise mask representing the god Tezcatlipoca, from the British Museum. The earliest known purely artistic production were small ceramic figures that appeared in Tehuac√°n area around 1,500 BCE and spread to Veracruz, the Valley of Mexico, Guerrero, Oaxaca, Chiapas and the Pacific coast of Guatemala. The earliest of these are mostly female figures, probably associated with fertility rites because of their often oversized hips and thighs, as well as a number with babies in arms or nursing. When male figures appear they are most often soldiers.Rosas Volume 2, p.5‚Äì6. The production of these ceramic figures, which would later include animals and other forms, remained an important art form for 2000 years. In the early Olmec period most were small but large-scale ceramic sculptures were produced as large as 55 cm.Rosas Volume 2, p.2.Rosas Volume 2, p.6. After the middle pre-Classic, ceramic sculpture declined in the center of Mexico except in the Chup√≠cuaro region. In the Mayan areas, the art disappears in the late pre-Classic, to reappear in the Classic, mostly in the form of whistles and other musical instruments. In a few areas, such as parts of Veracruz, the creation of ceramic figures continued uninterrupted until the Spanish conquest, but as a handcraft, not a formal art.Rosas Volume 2, p.6-7. Painted ceramic plate from Calakmul, 600 to 800 AD. Mesoamerican painting is found in various expressions‚Äîfrom murals, to the creation of codices and the painting of ceramic objects. Evidence of painting goes back at least to 1800 BCE and continues uninterrupted in one form or another until the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century.Rosas Volume 3, p.2. Although it may have occurred earlier, the earliest known cases of artistic painting of monumental buildings occur in the early Classic period with the Mayas at Uaxactun and Tikal, and in Teotihuacan with walls painted in various colors. Paints were made from animal, vegetable and mineral pigments and bases.Rosas Volume 3, p.4. Most paintings focus one or more human figures, which may be realistic or stylized, masculine, feminine or asexual. They may be naked or richly attired, but the social status of each figure is indicated in some way. Scenes often depict war, sacrifice, the roles of the gods or the acts of nobles. However, some common scenes with common people have been found as well.Rosas Volume 3, p.5. Other subjects included gods, symbols and animals. Mesoamerican painting was bi-dimensional with no efforts to create the illusion of depth. However, movement is often represented.Rosas Volume 3, p.7. Non-ceramic sculpture in Mesoamerica began with the modification of animal bones, with the oldest known piece being an animal skull from Tequixquiac that dates between 10,000 and 8,000 BCE. Most Mesoamerican sculpture is of stone; while relief work on buildings is the most dominant, freestanding sculpture was done as well. Freestanding three-dimensional stone sculpture began with the Olmecs, with the most famous example being the giant Olmec stone heads. This disappeared for the rest of the Mesoamerican period in favor of relief work until the late post-Classic with the Aztecs.Rosas Volume 3, p.12. A disk depicting the goddess Coyolxauhqui, 14th to 16th century, at the Templo Mayor museum. The majority of stonework during the Mesoamerican period is associated with monumental architecture that, along with mural painting, was considered an integral part of architecture rather than separate.Rosas Volume 1, p.15. Monumental architecture began with the Olmecs in southern Veracruz and the coastal area of Tabasco in places such as San Lorenzo; large temples on pyramid bases can still be seen in sites such as Montenegro, Chiapa de Corzo and La Venta. This practice spread to the Oaxaca area and the Valley of Mexico, appearing in cities such as Monte Alb√°n, Cuicuilco and Teotihuacan.Rosas Volume 1, p.18. Montezuma's headdress. It is now in the Museum of Ethnology, Vienna, and is a source of dispute between Austria and Mexico, as no similar pieces remain in Mexico. These cities had a nucleus of one or more plazas, with temples, palaces and Mesoamerican ball courts. Alignment of these structures was based on the cardinal directions and astronomy for ceremonial purposes, such as focusing the sun's rays during the spring equinox on a sculpted or painted image. This was generally tied to calendar systems.Rosas Volume 1, p.20-23. Relief sculpture and/or painting were created as the structures were built. By the latter pre-Classic, almost all monumental structures in Mesoamerica had extensive relief work. Some of the best examples of this are Monte Alb√°n, Teotihuacan and Tula.Rosas Volume 2, p.5. Pre-Hispanic reliefs are general lineal in design and low, medium and high reliefs can be found. While this technique is often favored for narrative scenes elsewhere in the world, Mesoamerican reliefs tend to focus on a single figure. The only time reliefs are used in the narrative sense is when several relief steles are placed together. The best relief work is from the Mayas, especially from Yaxchilan.Rosas Volume 2, p.4. Writing and art were not distinct as they have been for European cultures. Writing was considered art and art was often covering in writing. The reason for this is that both sought to record history and the culture's interpretation of reality. (salvatvolp14) Manuscripts were written on paper or other book-like materials then bundled into codices.Boone 2000, p. 28. The art of reading and writing was strictly designated to the highest priest classes, as this ability was a source of their power over society. The pictograms or glyphs of this writing system were more formal and rigid than images found on murals and other art forms as they were considered mostly symbolic, representing formulas related to astronomical events, genealogy and historic events. Most surviving pre-Hispanic codices come from the late Mesoamerican period and early colonial period, as more of these escaped destruction over history. For this reason, more is known about the Aztec Empire than the Mayan cultures. Important Aztec codices include the Borgia Group of mainly religious works, some of which probably pre-date the conquest, the Codex Borbonicus, Codex Mendoza, and the late Florentine Codex, which is in a European style but executed by Mexican artists, probably drawing on earlier material that is now lost. Important museum collections in Mexico include those of the National Museum of Anthropology and the Museo Diego Rivera Anahuacalli, both in Mexico City, as well as provincial museums.

Since the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Mexican art has been an ongoing and complex interaction between the traditions of Europe and native perspectives. Mural in which Cortes appears greeting the first 12 Franciscans of Mexico in the old monastery of Ozumba. Church construction After the conquest, Spaniards' first efforts were directed at evangelization and the related task of building churches, which needed indigenous labor for basic construction, but they Nahuas elaborated stonework exteriors and decorated church interiors. Indigenous craftsmen were taught European motifs, designs and techniques, but very early work, called tequitqui (Nahuatl for \\"vassal\\"), includes elements such as flattened faces and high-stiff relief.Rosas Volume 4, p.34. The Spanish friars directing construction were not trained architects or engineers. They relied on indigenous stonemasons and sculptors to build churches and other Christian structures, often in the same places as temples and shrines of the traditional religion. \\"Although some Indians complained about the burden such labor represented, most communities considered a large and impressive church to be a reflection of their town's importance and took justifiable pride in creating a sacred place for divine worship.\\"Ida Altman, Sarah Cline, Javier Pescador, The Early History of Greater Mexico. Prentice Hall 2003, 119. The fact that so many colonial-era churches have survived centuries it testament to their general good construction. The first monasteries built in and around Mexico City, such as the monasteries on the slopes of Popocatepetl, had Renaissance, Plateresque, Gothic or Moorish elements, or some combination. They were relatively undecorated, with building efforts going more towards high walls and fortress features to ward off attacks.Rosas Volume 4, p.17. The construction of more elaborate churches with large quantities of religious artwork would define much of the artistic output of the colonial period. Most of the production was related to the teaching and reinforcement of Church doctrine, just as in Europe. Religious art set the rationale for Spanish domination over the indigenous. Today, colonial-era structures and other works exist all over the country, with a concentration in the central highlands around Mexico City.Rosas Volume 4, p.3. The Mass of St. Gregory, feathers on wood panel, the oldest dated feather work with a Christian subject. Made by or for Diego Huanutzin, nephew and son-in-law of Moctezuma II to present to Pope Paul III, dated 1539 Feather work was a highly valued skill of prehispanic central Mexico that continued into the early colonial era. Spaniards were fascinated by this form of art, and indigenous feather workers (amanteca) produced religious images in this medium, mainly small \\"paintings\\", as well as religious vestments.Michael Schrefler, \\"Visual Arts: Sixteenth Century\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico, Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1557.Teresa Castello Yturbide, The Art of Featherwork in Mexico, Mexico: Fomento Cultural Banamex 1993. Indigenous writings Indians continued production of written manuscripts in the early colonial era, especially codices in the Nahua area of central Mexico. An important early manuscript that was commissioned for the Spanish crown was Codex Mendoza, named after the first viceroy of Mexico, Don Antonio de Mendoza, which shows the tribute delivered to the Aztec ruler from individual towns as well as descriptions of proper comportment for the common people. A far more elaborate project utilizing indigenous scribes illustration is the project resulting in the Florentine Codex directed by Franciscan Bernardino de Sahag√∫n. Other indigenous manuscripts in the colonial era include the Huexotzinco Codex and Codex Osuna. An important type of manuscript from the early period were pictorial and textual histories of the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs from the indigenous viewpoint. The early Lienzo de Tlaxcala illustrated the contributions the Spaniards' Tlaxcalan allies made to the defeat of the Aztec Empire, as well the Hern√°n Cort√©s and his cultural translator Do√±a Marina (Malinche). Painting Most Nahua artists producing this visual art are anonymous. An exception is the work of Juan Gerson, who ca. 1560 decorated the vault of the Franciscan church in the Nahua town of Tecamachalco,(Puebla state), with individual scenes from the Old Testament.Schrefler, \\"Visual Arts\\", p.1556. While colonial art remained almost completely European in style, with muted colors and no indication of movement‚Äîthe addition of native elements, which began with the tequitqui, continued. They were never the center of the works, but decorative motifs and filler, such as native foliage, pineapples, corn, and cacao. Much of this can be seen on portals as well as large frescoes that often decorated the interior of churches and the walls of monastery areas closed to the public. The earliest of Mexico's colonial artists were Spanish-born who came to Mexico in the middle of their careers. This included mendicant friars, such as Fray Alonso L√≥pez de Herrera. Later, most artists were born in Mexico, but trained in European techniques, often from imported engravings. This dependence on imported copies meant that Mexican works preserved styles after they had gone out of fashion in Europe. In the colonial period, artists worked in guilds, not independently. Each guild had its own rules, precepts, and mandates in technique‚Äîwhich did not encourage innovation.Rosas Volume 4, p.10. Important museum collections include those of the Museo Soumaya and Museo Nacional de San Carlos, both in Mexico City. =Gallery= File:Geistliche_Schatzkammer_Wien_(2).JPGRepresentation of Mary as a feather picture, Juan Baptista Cuiris, 1550/1580 File:Codex Mendoza folio 2r.jpgFounding of Tenochtitlan in Codex Mendoza ca. 1541.

Self-portrait Baroque painting became firmly established in Mexico by the middle of the 17th century with the work of Spaniard Sebasti√°n L√≥pez de Arteaga. His painting is exemplified by the canvas called Doubting Thomas from 1643. In this work, the Apostle Thomas is shown inserting his finger in the wound in Christ's side to emphasize Christ's suffering. The caption below reads \\"the Word made flesh\\" and is an example of Baroque's didactic purpose. One difference between painters in Mexico and their European counterparts is that they preferred realistic directness and clarity over fantastic colors, elongated proportions and extreme spatial relationships. The goal was to create a realistic scene in which the viewer could imagine himself a part of. This was a style created by Caravaggio in Italy, which became popular with artists in Seville, from which many migrants came to New Spain came. Similarly, Baroque free standing sculptures feature life-size scales, realistic skin tones and the simulation of gold-threaded garments through a technique called estofado, the application of paint over gold leaf. Church of San Francisco Acatepec with Baroque Talavera tiling The most important later influence to Mexican and other painters in Latin America was the work of Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens, known through copies made from engravings and mezzotint techniques. His paintings were copied and reworked and became the standard for both religious and secular art. Later Baroque paintings moved from the confines of altarpieces to colossal freestanding canvases on church interiors. One of the best known Mexican painters of this kind of work was Crist√≥bal de Villalpando. His work can be seen in the sacristy of the Mexico City Cathedral, which was done between 1684 and 1686. These canvases were glued directly onto the walls with arched frames to stabilize them, and placed just under the vaults of the ceiling. Even the fresco work of the 16th century was not usually this large. Another one of Villalpando's works is the cupola of the Puebla Cathedral in 1688. He used Rubens' brush techniques and the shape of the structure to create a composition of clouds with angels and saints, from which a dove descends to represent the Holy Spirit. The light from the cupola's windows is meant to symbolize God's grace. Juan Rodr√≠guez Ju√°rez (1675‚Äì1728) and mulatto artist Juan Correa (1646‚Äì1716) were also prominent painters of the baroque era. Correa's most famous student, Jos√© de Ibarra (1685‚Äì1756), was also mixed- race. One of Mexico's finest painters, Miguel Cabrera (1695‚Äì1768), was likely mixed race.Ilona Katzew, \\"Valiant Styles: New Spanish Painting, 1700‚Äì85\\" in Painting in Latin America, 1550‚Äì1820, Luisa Elena Alcal√° and Jonathan Brown, eds. New Haven: Yale University Press 2014, p. 169. The Church produced the most important works of the seventeenth century. Among the important painters were Baltasar de Echave Ibia and his son Baltasar Echave Rioja, also Luis Ju√°rez and his son Jos√© Ju√°rez, Juan Correa, Crist√≥bal de Villalpando, Rodrigo de la Piedra, Antonio de Santander, Polo Bernardino, Juan de Villalobos, Juan Salguero and Juan de Herrera. Juan Correa, worked from 1671 to 1716 and reached great prestige and reputation for the quality of its design and scale of some of his works. Among the best known: 'Apocalypse in the Cathedral of Mexico', 'Conversion of St. Mary Magdalene', now in the 'Pinacoteca Virreinal' and 'Santa Catarina and Adam and Eve casting out of paradise', the latter located in the National Museum of Viceroyalty of Tepotzotl√°n.Arte y cultura en la colonia Colonial religious art was sponsored by Church authorities and private patrons. Sponsoring the rich ornamentation of churches was a way for the wealthy to gain prestige. In the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, Mexico City was one of the wealthiest in the world, mostly due to mining and agriculture, and was able to support a large art scene. =Gallery= File:Lactaci√≥n de Santo Domingo.JPGThe Lactaci√≥n de Santo Domingo, by Crist√≥bal de Villalpando painted near the end of the 17th century.

Anon. Museo Nacional de Historia, Mexico City. Portraiture Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz by Miguel Cabrera 1750. In New Spain, as in the rest of the New World, since the seventeenth century, particularly during the eighteenth century, the portrait became an important part of the artistic repertoire. In a society characterized by a deep religious feeling which was imbued, it is not surprising that many portraits reflected the moral virtues and piety of the model. While most commissioned art was for churches, secular works were commissioned as well. Portrait painting was known relatively early in the colonial period, mostly of viceroys and archbishops, as well as the conqueror Hern√°n Cort√©s. Portraits of royal and ecclesiastical officials were an approximation of the sitter's appearance, and were displayed in their official settings. They often included their coats of arms. In the sixteenth-century portrait of Cort√©s, the conqueror is portrayed with a baton, sword, and armor \\"symbolize political and military might, but the discarded glove helmet and glove reveal that his warring activities are completed.\\"Donahue-Wallace, p. 204. Portraits of viceroys and ecclesiastics were often portrayed in rich clothing and writing implements, along with their coats of arms indicating their genealogy and high standing as well as books and writing implements. In Mexico, there are few exemplars of royal officials from before the eighteenth century, perhaps because the 1696 riot destroyed the portrait gallery in the viceregal palace.Donahue-Wallace, Art and Architecture of Viceregal Latin America, p. 201, 204. Beginning in the late seventeenth century, portrait painting of local elites became a significant genre. Especially important is that women were portrayed for the first time, starting in the eighteenth century. These works followed European models, with symbols of rank and titles either displayed unattached in the outer portions or worked into another element of the paintings such as curtains. Elite women were dressed in rich embroidered and embellished dresses, usually of silk and lace, with jewelry and other adornment. Many were painted with fans in their hands. Unlike their male counterparts in elite society showing their status and authority, portraits of women were idealized images of womanhood with symbols of femininity.Donahue-Wallace, p. 205 A subset of their genre were portraits of nuns when they first professed, dressed in elaborate clothing appropriate for the solemn step they were taking in entering the convent. A notable example is by Jos√© de Alc√≠bar of Sor (sister) Mar√≠a Ignacia de la Sangre de Cristo, with a ceremonial crown, embroidered robes, and other accoutrements. Miguel Cabrera's posthumous portrait of Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz, famous in her own time, in her convent cell surrounded by books, is different from most nun's portraits, painted from life or immediately postmortem. There are also a number of postmortem portraits of nuns. There are quite a number of family group portraits with a religious devotional theme, commissioned to show the family's piety, but also as way to display the family's wealth. Josep Antonio de Ayala was a prominent artist, who is known for painting \\"The family of the Valley at the foot of Our Lady of Loreto\\" (c. 1769). This devotional painting was commissioned for the children of the del Valle family in memory of his parents and is characteristic of the painting of this century. The Virgin of Loreto is central to the composition, with the stiff figures of the family members are finely dressed. The men are in fashionable clothing of the era, with the matriarch of the family wearing an embroidered and lace dress, along with pearls. The daughters are shown in the habit of Conceptionist nuns, with escudos de monjas, religious paintings worn on their chests. The painting is inscribed with in information about its commission and the parents, and the fact that it hung in chapel of the family's hacienda. The painting is a display of piety and wealth. There are such group paintings with different central religious figures.Donahue-Wallace, p. 207. Two notable portrait painters are brothers in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century are Juan Rodr√≠guez Ju√°rez and Nicol√°s. Some other prominent painters of this period are: Crist√≥bal de Villalpando, Juan Correa, Jos√© de Ibarra, Joseph Mora, Francisco Martinez, Miguel Cabrera, Andr√©s L√≥pez, and Nicol√°s Enr√≠quez. In the 18th century, artists increasingly included the Latin phrase pinxit Mexici (painted in Mexico) on works bound for the European market as a sign of pride in their artistic tradition. =Gallery= Image:Hernan Fernando Cortes.jpgHern√°n Cort√©s, with his coat of arms on the upper left corner. 16th c.

Also important was a history painting of the destruction of the Franciscan mission of San Sab√° by Comanches, by Jos√© de P√°ez. Paintings of Mexico City sites appeared beginning in the seventeenth century, most famously a painting by Crist√≥bal de Villalpando of the Plaza Mayor in Mexico City, ca. 1696, showing the damage to the viceregal palace from the 1692 corn riot. It also shows the Pari√°n market, where luxury goods were sold. The Pari√°n market was also the subject of at least one other painting. =Gallery= File:The Conquest of Tenochtitlan.jpgHistory painting of the Spanish Conquest of Tenochtitlan, 17th century File:La consagraci√≥n de los templos paganos y la primera misa en M√©xico-Tenochtitlan.jpgThe consecration of pagan temples and the first mass in Mexico-Tenochtitlan by Jos√© Vivar y Valderrama, ca. 1752.

Some were likely commissioned by Spanish functionaries as souvenirs of Mexico. A number of artists of the era created casta paintings, including Miguel Cabrera, Jos√© de Ibarra, Juan Patricio Morlete Ruiz, Francisco Clapera, and Luis de Mena, but most casta paintings are unsigned. Ibarra, Morlete, and possibly Cabrera were of mixed race and born outside Mexico City.Ilona Katzew, \\"Valiant Styles: New Spanish Painting, 1700-85\\" in Painting in Latin America, 1550‚Äì1820, Luisa Elena Alcal√° and Jonathan Brown. New Haven: Yale University Press 2014, p. 169. Mena's only known casta painting links the Virgin of Guadalupe and the casta system, as well as depictions of fruits and vegetables and scenes of everyday life in mideighteenth-century Mexico. It is one of the most-reproduced examples of casta paintings, one of the small number that show the casta system on a single canvas rather than up to 16 separate paintings. It is unique in uniting the thoroughly secular genre of casta painting with a depiction of the Virgin of Guadalupe.Sarah Cline, \\"Guadalupe and the Castas: The Power of a Singular Colonial Mexican Painting\\", Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos, Vol. 31, Issue 2, Summer 2015, pages 218‚Äì246. Production of these paintings stopped after the 1821 conclusion of the Mexican War of Independence, when legal racial categories were repudiated in independent Mexico. Until the run-up to the 500th anniversary of the Columbus's 1492 voyage, casta paintings were of little or no interest, even to art historians, but scholars began systematically studying them as a genre.Cline, \\"Guadalupe and the Castas\\", p. 221.Ilona Katzew. Casta Paintings: Images of Race in Eighteenth-Century Mexico. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004. A set of casta paintings was included in Pedro Alonso O'Crouley's A Description of the Kingdom of New Spain, published in translation in 1972.A Description of the Kingdom of New Spain by Sr. Dn.

Biombos, or folding screens Biombos or folding screens became popular among elites in the seventeenth century. Large and meant for display in public and private rooms of elite homes, they had a variety of subject matter, ranging from paintings of historical events, real or imagined, allegorical presentations, and scenes from everyday life in Mexico. Mexico was a crossroads of trade in the colonial period, with goods from Asia and Europe mixing with those locally produced. This convergence is most evident in the decorative arts of New Spain. It was popular among the upper classes to have a main public room, called a salon de estrado, to be covered in rugs and cushions for women to recline in Moorish fashion. Stools and later chairs and settees were added for men. Starting in the seventeenth century when the Manila Galleon sailed regularly from the Philippines to the Pacific port of Acapulco, folding screens or biombos (from the Japanese byo-bu or \\"protection from wind\\") were among the luxury goods brought from Asia. They are known to have been brought by 1610 and were subsequently produced by Mexican artists and artisans in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. They were fashionable Mexican elites at the highest level and some were shipped to Europe. Most appear to have been produced locally in Mexico. Juan Correa produced several in the late seventeenth century, one of the 1519 meeting of Hern√°n Cort√©s and Moctezuma, which might have depicted more current events of an traditional Indian dance (mitote) performed on feast of Corpus Christi, symbolizing indigenous submission to Spanish rule and Christianity. Cort√©s is presented as \\"both a secular and religious hero\\" while Moctezuma on a ceremonial litter has \\"the trappings of a Roman emperor,\\" depicting a meeting of equals.Oles, Art and Architecture in Mexico, p. 85. Another was allegorical, entitled The Four Continents (ca. 1683), showing Europe, America, Asia and Africa with Europe and Asia at the center, and America and Africa at either end.Oles, Art and Architecture in Mexico, pp. 80-81.Donohue-Wallace, Art and Architecture of Viceregal Latin America, pp. 211-217. The earliest of these Mexican made screens had oriental designs but later ones had European and Mexican themes. One example of this is a screen by an anonymous artist with the conquest of Mexico one side and an aerial view of central Mexico City's streets and buildings, but no people, on the other, now at the Franz Mayer Museum. Another is a local scene of an Indian wedding, with voladores (\\"flyers\\") suspended by ropes on their feet. =Gallery= File:Large_screen_of_the_Palace_of_the_Viceroys_of_Mexico,_ca._1676-1700,_Mexico_City,_Museum_of_the_Americas,_anonimous_painter.jpgLarge screen of the Palace of the Viceroys of Mexico, ca. 1676-1700, Mexico City, Museum of the Americas File:ScreenConquest17Cent01.jpgA Biombo screen with a depiction of the Spanish conquest of Mexico at the Franz Mayer Museum File:Los Cuatro Elementos - Juan Correa.jpgJuan Correa, The liberal arts and the four elements (Las artes liberales y los cuatro elementos). 1670 File:Folding Screen with Indian Wedding and Flying Pole (Biombo con desposorio ind√≠gena y palo volador) - Google Art Project.jpgFolding Screen with Indian Wedding and Voladores, ca. 1690 DisplayRoomFranzMayer.jpgOne of the display areas in the Franz Mayer Museum in Mexico City DisplayroomFranzMayerDF.jpgOne of the display areas in the Franz Mayer Museum in Mexico City The Academy of San Carlos Portrait of Manuel Tols√°, architect and director of the Academy of San Carlos by Rafael Ximeno y Planes, director of painting at the Academy The last colonial era art institution established was the Academy of San Carlos in 1783. While the depiction of saints consumed most artistic efforts, they were not without political effects. The most important of these was the rise of the cult of the Virgin of Guadalupe as an American rather than European saint, representative of a distinct identity.Rosas, 1982, p.13. The Crown promoted the establishment in Mexico of the Neoclassical style of art and architecture, which had become popular in Spain. This style was a reinterpretation of Greco- Roman references and its use was a way to reinforce European dominance in the Spain's colonies. One Neoclassical artist from the Academy at the end of the colonial period was Manuel Tols√°. He first taught sculpture at the Academy of San Carlos and then became its second director. Tols√° designed a number of Neoclassical buildings in Mexico but his best known work is an equestrian status of King Charles IV in bronze cast in 1803 and originally placed in the Z√≥calo. As of 2011 it can be seen at the Museo Nacional de Arte. By the late 18th century, Spain's colonies were becoming culturally independent from Spain, including its arts. The Academy was established by the Spanish Crown to regain control of artistic expression and the messages it disseminated. This school was staffed by Spanish artists in each of the major disciplines, with the first director being Antonio Gil. The school became home to a number of plaster casts of classic statues from the San Fernando Fine Arts Academy in Spain, brought there for teaching purposes. These casts are on display in the Academy's central patio. The Academy of San Carlos survived into post- independence Mexico. List of Colonial Mexican artists Independence to the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution, 1821‚Äì1910 Early Post-independence era to the Mid Nineteenth Century Hero of Independence, Father Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos, painted from life, artist unknown, likely not academically trained. ca. 1812. The Mexican flag during most of the nineteenth century. The flag with the eagle wearing a gold crown was designed by Agust√≠n de Iturbide, emperor of Mexico 1821‚Äì22. Artists of the independence era in Mexico (1810‚Äì21) produced works showing the insurgency's heroes. A portrait of secular cleric Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos in his military uniform was painted by an unknown artist, traditionally ascribed to be indigenous.Oles, Art and Architecture in Mexico, p. 151. The portrait is typical of those from the late eighteenth century, with framing elements, a formal caption, and new elements being iconography of the emerging Mexican nationalism, including the eagle atop the nopal cactus, which became the central image for the Mexican flag.James Oles, Mexican Art and Architecture. London: Thames & Hudson 2013, pp. 151-152. Morelos was the subject of a commissioned statue, with Pedro Pati√±o Ixtolinque, who trained at the Academy of San Carlos and remained an important sculptor through the era of era independence.James Oles, Art and Architecture in Mexico. London: Thames and Hudson 2013, pp. 153-154. The Academy of San Carlos remained the center of academic painting and the most prestigious art institution in Mexico until the Mexican War of Independence, during which it was closed. Despite its association with the Spanish Crown and European painting tradition, the Academy was reopened by the new government after Mexico gained full independence in 1821. Its former Spanish faculty and students either died during the war or returned to Spain, but when it reopened it attracted the best art students of the country, and continued to emphasize classical European traditions until the early 20th century. The academy was renamed to the National Academy of San Carlos. The new government continued to favor Neoclassical as it considered the Baroque a symbol of colonialism. The Neoclassical style continued in favor through the reign of Maximilian I although President Benito Ju√°rez supported it only reluctantly, considering its European focus a vestige of colonialism. Tlahuicole (1852), Tlaxcala. Despite Neoclassicism's association with European domination, it remained favored by the Mexican government after Independence and was used in major government commissions at the end of the century. However, indigenous themes appeared in paintings and sculptures. One indigenous figure depicted in Neoclassical style is Tlahuicol, done by Catalan artist Manuel Vilar in 1851. There were two reasons for this shift in preferred subject. The first was that Mexican society denigrated colonial culture‚Äîthe indigenous past was seen as more truly Mexican. The other factor was a worldwide movement among artists to confront society, which began around 1830. In Mexico, this anti-establishment sentiment was directed at the Academy of San Carlos and its European focus.Paz, 1987 p.2. In the first half of the 19th century, the Romantic style of painting was introduced into Mexico and the rest of Latin America by foreign travelers interested in the newly independent country. One of these was Bavarian artist Johann Moritz Rugendas, who lived in the country from 1831 to 1834. He painted scenes with dynamic composition and bright colors in accordance with Romantic style, looking for striking, sublime, and beautiful images in Mexico as well as other areas of Latin America. However much of Rugendas's works are sketches for major canvases, many of which were never executed. Others include Englishman Daniel Egerton, who painted landscapes in the British Romantic tradition, and German Carl Nebel, who primarily created lithographs of the various social and ethnic populations of the country. A number of native-born artists at the time followed the European Romantic painters in their desire to document the various cultures of Mexico. These painters were called costumbristas, a word deriving from costumbre (custom). The styles of these painters were not always strictly Romantic, involving other styles as well. Most of these painters were from the upper classes and educated in Europe. While the European painters viewed subjects as exotic, the costumbristas had a more nationalistic sense of their home countries. One of these painters was Agust√≠n Arrieta from Puebla, who applied realistic techniques to scenes from his home city, capturing its brightly painted tiles and ceramics. His scenes often involved everyday life such as women working in kitchen and depicted black and Afro-Mexican vendors. =Gallery= File:Entrada del Generalisimo Don Agustin de Iturbide a Mexico.jpgEntrance of Agust√≠n de Iturbide to Mexico City in 1821.

In the mid-to late 19th century Latin American academies began to shift away from severe Neoclassicism to \\"academic realism\\". Idealized and simplified depictions became more realistic, with emphasis on details. Scenes in this style were most often portraits of the upper classes, Biblical scenes, and battles‚Äîespecially those from the Independence period. When the Academy of San Carlos was reopened after a short closure in 1843, its new Spanish and Italian faculty pushed this realist style. Despite government support and nationalist themes, native artists were generally shorted in favor of Europeans. The Good Samaritan (1838) by Pelegr√≠ Clav√©. One of the most important painters in Mexico in the mid 19th century was Catalan Pelegr√≠ Clav√©, who painted landscapes but was best known for his depictions of the intellectual elite of Mexico City. Realist painters also attempted to portray Aztec culture and people by depicting settings inhabited by indigenous people, using live indigenous models and costumes based on those in Conquest era codices. One of these was F√©lix Parra, whose depictions of the conquest empathized with the suffering of the indigenous. In 1869, Jos√© Obreg√≥n painted The Discovery of Pulque; he based his depictions of architecture on Mixtec codices, but misrepresented temples as a setting for a throne.dead link The art of the 19th century after Independence is considered to have declined, especially during the late 19th century and early 20th, during the regime of Porfirio D√≠az (1876‚Äì1911). Although during this time, painting, sculpture, and the decorative arts were often limited to imitation of European styles, the emergence of young artists, such as Diego Rivera and Saturnino Herr√°n, increased the focus on Mexican-themed works. This meant that following the military phase of the Mexican Revolution in the 1920s, Mexican artists made huge strides is forging a robust artistic nationalism. In this century there are examples of murals such as folkloric style created between 1855 and 1867 in La Barca, Jalisco. Highlights at this time: Pelegr√≠n Clav√©, Juan Cordero, Felipe Santiago Guti√©rrez and Jos√© Agust√≠n Arrieta. In Mexico, in 1846 he was hired to direct Pelegr√≠n Clav√©'s reopening of the Academy of San Carlos, a body from which he promoted the historical and landscaping themes with a pro- European vision. =Gallery= File:14Orizaba desde el Puente de Paso del Toro.pngOrizaba desde el Puente de Paso del Toro by Casimiro Castro, from Album of the Mexican Railway (1877) File:FundacionMexicoDF.JPGJos√© Mar√≠a Jara (1867‚Äì1939), Foundation of Mexico City.

Monuments and sculpture In the second half of the nineteenth century, monuments to historical events were erected in many Mexican cities, most especially in the capital. One of the first was a monument to Christopher Columbus, on the broad Paseo de la Reforma, commissioned by Antonio Escand√≥n, who made a fortune constructing the Mexico City-Veracruz railway. Escand√≥n \\"decided to commemorate the era of the railroad in Mexico with a monument to an equally epochal event, the Discovery of the New World.\\"Claudia Agostoni, Monuments of Progress: Modernization and Public Health in Mexico City, 1876-1910. University of Calgary Press 2003, p. 95. During the Porfiriato (1876-1910), the Paseo de la Reforma became a key place to display statues to Mexican heroes, with the traffic round-abouts (glorietas) having a particular place of honor.Tenenbaum, Barbara. \\"Streetwise History: The Paseo de la Reforma and the Porfirian State, 1876-1910\\" in Rituals of Rule, Rituals of Resistance. Public Celebrations and Popular Culture in Mexico, eds. William H. Beezley, Cheryl English Martin, and William E. French. Wilmington: Scholarly Resources 1994. In 1887, Porfirio D√≠az commissioned the statue of the last Aztec emperor, Cuauht√©moc, which can be seen on Paseo de la Reforma. Cuauht√©moc is depicted with a toga-like cloak with a feathered headdress similar to an Etruscan or Trojan warrior rather than an Aztec emperor. The base has elements reminiscent of Mitla and Roman architecture. This base contains bronze plates depicting scenes from the Spanish conquest, but focusing on the indigenous figures. A modest obelisk commemorating the Ni√±os H√©roes, cadets who died defending their post during the U.S. takeover of Mexico City during the Mexican American War (1847), was erected in 1884. A much larger one was built in the mid-twentieth century at the entrance to Chapultepec Park. Arguably the most famous monument of the era is the Monument to Independence, often called \\"the Angel of independence\\" for its winged victory. It was commissioned for the centenary of independence in 1910 and inaugurated by Porfirio D√≠az during the festivities in September 1910. =Gallery= File:Monumento a Col√≥n Paseo de la Reforma Ciudad de M√©xico.jpgMonument to Columbus, Mexico City, 1877.

Mexico City. 1910. 20th century The Academy of San Carlos continued to advocate classic, European-style training until 1913. In this year, the academy was partially integrated with National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). Between 1929 and the 1950s, the academy's architecture program was split off as a department of the university; the programs in painting, sculpture, and engraving were renamed the National School of Expressive Arts, now the Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas (ENAP). Both moved to the south of the city in the mid-20th century, to Ciudad Universitaria and Xochimilco respectively, leaving only some graduate programs in fine arts in the original academy building in the historic center. ENAP remains one of the main centers for the training of Mexico's artists. Mexican muralism and Revolutionary art A portion of Alegor√≠a a la Virgen de Guadalupe by Ferm√≠n Revueltas located in one of the walls of the San Ildefonso College. While a shift to more indigenous and Mexican themes appeared in the 19th century, the Mexican Revolution from 1910 to 1920 had a dramatic effect on Mexican art. The conflict resulted in the rise of the Partido Revolucionario Nacional (renamed the Partido Revolucionario Institucional), which took the country in a socialist direction. The government became an ally to many of the intellectuals and artists in Mexico City and commissioned murals for public buildings to reinforce its political messages including those that emphasized Mexican rather than European themes. These were not created for popular or commercial tastes; however, they gained recognition not only in Mexico, but in the United States.Paz, 1987 p.24. \\"The great Mexican muralists of the post-revolution developed, with the paint mural, the concept of 'public art', an art to be seen by the masses in major public buildings of the time, and could not be bought and transported easily elsewhere, as with easel painting.\\" \\"La fiesta del Se√±or de Chalma\\" on one of the walls of the San Ildefonso College by Fernando Leal This production of art in conjunction with government propaganda is known as the Mexican Modernist School or the Mexican Muralist Movement, and it redefined art in Mexico.Paz, 1987 p.298-299. Octavio Paz gives Jos√© Vasconcelos credit for initiating the Muralist movement in Mexico by commissioning the best-known painters in 1921 to decorate the walls of public buildings. The commissions were politically motivated‚Äîthey aimed to glorify the Mexican Revolution and redefine the Mexican people vis-√†-vis literally \\"face to face (with)\\" their indigenous and Spanish past.Paz, 1987 p.11. The Tree of Life or The Tree of Science painted by Roberto Montenegro at the San Pedro y San Pablo College (Museum of Light) The first of these commissioned paintings were at San Ildefonso done by Fernando Leal, Ferm√≠n Revueltas, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Diego Rivera. The first true fresco in the building was the work of Jean Charlot. However, technical errors were made in the construction of these murals: a number of them began to blister and were covered in wax for preservation.Paz, 1987 p.12. Roberto Montenegro painted the former church and monastery of San Pedro y San Pablo, but the mural in the church was painted in tempera and began to flake. In the monastery area, Montenegro painted the Feast of the Holy Cross, which depicts Vasconcelos as the protector of Muralists. Vasconcelos was later blanked out and a figure of a woman was painted over him.Paz, 1987 p.12-13. Detail of mural \\"Gente y paisaje de Michoac√°n\\" at the Palacio de Gobierno in Michoac√°n (1962). The first protagonist in the production of modern murals in Mexico was Dr. Atl. Dr Atl was born \\"Gerard Murillo\\" in Guadalajara in 1875. He changed his name in order to identify himself as Mexican. Atl worked to promote Mexico's folk art and handcrafts. While he had some success as a painter in Guadalajara, his radical ideas against academia and the government prompted him to move to more liberal Mexico City. In 1910, months before the start of the Mexican Revolution, Atl painted the first modern mural in Mexico. He taught major artists to follow him, including those who came to dominate Mexican mural painting. The muralist movement reached its height in the 1930s with four main protagonists: Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Jos√© Clemente Orozco, and Fernando Leal. It is the most studied part of Mexico's art history. All were artists trained in classical European techniques and many of their early works are imitations of then-fashionable European paintings styles, some of which were adapted to Mexican themes. The political situation in Mexico from the 1920s to 1950s and the influence of Dr. Atl prompted these artists to break with European traditions, using bold indigenous images, lots of color, and depictions of human activity, especially of the masses, in contrast to the solemn and detached art of Europe. Preferred mediums generally excluded traditional canvases and church porticos and instead were the large, then- undecorated walls of Mexico's government buildings. The main goal in many of these paintings was the glorification of Mexico's pre-Hispanic past as a definition of Mexican identity. They had success in both Mexico and the United States, which brought them fame and wealth as well as Mexican and American students. Mural Sue√±o de una Tarde Dominical en la Alameda Central in Mexico City, featuring Rivera and Frida Kahlo standing by La Calavera Catrina. These muralists revived the fresco technique for their mural work, although Siqueiros moved to industrial techniques and materials such as the application of pyroxilin, a commercial enamel used for airplanes and automobiles. One of Rivera's earliest mural efforts emblazoned the courtyard of the Ministry of Education with a series of dancing tehuanas (natives of Tehuantepec in southern Mexico). This four-year project went on to incorporate other contemporary indigenous themes, and it eventually encompassed 124 frescoes that extended three stories high and two city blocks long. The Abelardo Rodriguez Market was painted in 1933 by students of Diego Rivera, one of whom was Isamu Noguchi.Paz, 1987 p.16. Another important figure of this time period was Frida Kahlo, the wife of Diego Rivera. While she painted canvases instead of murals, she is still considered part of the Mexican Modernist School as her work emphasized Mexican folk culture and colors. Kahlo's self-portraits during the 1930s and 40s were in stark contrast to the lavish murals artists like her husband were creating at the time. Having suffered a crippling bus accident earlier in her teenage life, she began to challenge Mexico's obsession with the female body. Her portraits, purposefully small, addressed a wide range of topics not being addressed by the mainstream art world at the time. These included motherhood, domestic violence, and male egoism. Her paintings never had subjects wearing lavish jewelry or fancy clothes like those found in muralist paintings. Instead, she would sparsely dress herself up, and when there were accessories, it added that much more importance to them. She would also depict herself in very surreal, unsettling scenarios like in The Two Fridas where she depicts two versions of herself, one with a broken heart and one with a healthy infusing the broken heart with \\"hopeful\\" blood., or Henry Ford Hospital where she depicts herself in having an abortion and the struggle she had in real life coming to terms with it. Although she was the wife of Diego Rivera, her self-portraits stayed rather obscured from the public eye until well after her passing in 1954. Her art has grown in popularity and she is seen by many to be one of the earliest and most influential feminist artists of the 20th century. = Gallery = File:Hidalgo de Jos√© Clemente Orozco.JPGJos√© Clemente Orozco, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, Jalisco Governmental Palace, Guadalajara File:LaTrincheraOrozcoSICDF.JPGJos√© Clemente Orozco, The Trench San Ildefonso College, Mexico City File:Murales Rivera - Markt in Tlatelolco 3.jpgDiego Rivera Tenochtitlan, Palacio Nacional, Mexico City.

For this reason he was first appreciated outside of Mexico.Paz, 1987 p.24-25. Tamayo was a contemporary to Rivera, Siqueiros, and Orozco, and trained at the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes. Like them he explored Mexican identity in his work after the Mexican Revolution. However, he rejected the political Social Realism popularized by the three other artists and was rejected by the new establishment. He left for New York in 1926 where success allowed him to exhibit in his native Mexico. His lack of support for the post-Revolutionary government was controversial. Because of this he mostly remained in New York, continuing with his success there and later in Europe. His rivalry with the main three Mexican muralists continued both in Mexico and internationally through the 1950s. Even a belated honorific of \\"The Fourth Great Ones\\" was controversial. Despite maintaining an active national art scene, Mexican artists after the muralist period had a difficult time breaking into the international art market. One reason for this is that in the Americas, Mexico City was replaced by New York as the center of the art community, especially for patronage.Paz, 1987 p.25. Within Mexico, government sponsorship of art in the 20th century (dominated until 2000 by the PRI party) meant religious themes and criticism of the government were effectively censored. This was mostly passive, with the government giving grants to artists who conformed to their requirements. In the 1940s, Wolfgang Paalen published the extremely influential DYN magazine in Mexico City, which focussed on a transitional movement between surrealism to abstract expressionism. Fumiko Nakashima a Japanese artist lives in Mexico, primarily working on surrealist pieces in watercolor. In 1953, Museo Experimental El Eco (in Mexico City) opened; it was created by Mathias Goeritz. The Rupture Movement A mural and clock sculpture by Manuel Felguerez at Universidad La Salle, Campus central. The first major movement after the muralists was the Rupture Movement, which began in the 1950s and 1960s with painters such as Jos√© Luis Cuevas, Gilberto Navarro, Rafael Coronel, Alfredo Casaneda, and sculptor Juan Soriano. They rejected social realism and nationalism and incorporated surrealism, visual paradoxes, and elements of Old World painting styles. This break meant that later Mexican artists were generally not influenced by muralism or by Mexican folk art. Jos√© Luis Cuevas created self- portraits in which he reconstructed scenes from famous paintings by Spanish artists such as Diego Vel√°zquez, Francisco de Goya, and Picasso. Like Kahlo before him, he drew himself but instead of being centered, his image is often to the side, as an observer. The goal was to emphasize the transformation of received visual culture. Another important figure during this time period was Swiss-Mexican Gunther Gerzso, but his work was a \\"hard-edged variant\\" of Abstract Expressionism, based on clearly defined geometric forms as well as colors, with an effect that makes them look like low relief. His work was a mix of European abstraction and Latin American influences, including Mesoamerican ones. In the watercolor field we can distinguish Edgardo Coghlan and Ignacio Barrios who were not aligned to a specific artistic movement but were not less important. The Olympics in Mexico City (1968) and later \\"Designed by Mathias Goeritz, a series of sculptures ... [lined] the \\"Route of Friendship\\" (Ruta de la Amistad) in celebration of the Olympics ... In contestation to the government-sanctioned artistic exhibition for the Olympics, a group of diverse, independent visual artists organize a counterpresentation entitled Sal√≥n Independiente, or Independent Salon; the exhibition signifies a key event in the resistance by artists of state- controlled cultural policies. This show of antigovernment efforts by artists would also be expressed in a mural in support of student movement's protests; the work became known as the Mural Ef√≠mero (or Ephemeral Mural)\\" at UNAM\\". The third Independent Salon was staged in 1970. In 1976 \\"Fernando Gamboa spearheads the organization of an exposition of abstract art entitled El Geometrismo Mexicano Una Tendencia Actual\\". \\"In an attempt to reassess ... post-1968 Mexican art, the Museum of Science and Art at UNAM\\" organized in 2007, the exhibition La Era de la Discrepancia. Arte y cultura visual en M√©xico 1968-1997 In 1990 the exhibition Mexico: Esplendor de Treinta Siglos, started its world tour at Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Neo- expressionism Sculpture called \\"Siamesas\\" by Jose Luis Cuevas From the 1960s to the 1980s Neo-expressionist art was represented in Mexico by Manuel Felguerez, Teresa Cito, Alejandro Pinatado, and Jan Hendrix. Swiss-German artist, Mathias Goeritz, in the 1950s created public sculptures including the Torres Sat√©lite in Ciudad Sat√©lite. In the 1960s, he became central to the development of abstract and other modern art along with Jos√© Luis Cuevas and Pedro Friedeberg. Neomexicanismo In the mid-1980s, the next major movement in Mexico was Neomexicanismo, a slightly surreal, somewhat kitsch and postmodern version of Social Realism that focused on popular culture rather than history. The name neomexicanismo was originally used by critics to belittle the movement. Works were not necessarily murals: they used other mediums such as collage and often parodied and allegorized cultural icons, mass media, religion, and other aspects of Mexican culture. This generation of artists were interested in traditional Mexican values and exploring their roots‚Äîoften questioning or subverting them. Another common theme was Mexican culture vis-√†-vis globalization. Postmodern Art from the 1990s to the present is roughly categorized as Postmodern, although this term has been used to describe works created before the 1990s. Major artists associated with this label include Betsabe√© Romero, Monica Castillo, Francisco Larios, Martha Chapa and Diego Toledo.

(Prior to that, claims were made in 2004, that a deficit of native writing about Mexican art, symbolism, and trends, resulted in modern Mexican art shown abroad having been mislabeled or poorly described, as foreign institutions do not sufficiently understand or appreciate the political and social circumstances behind the pieces.Gallo, 2004 p.13.)  20th century Mexican artists  =Most prominent painters with international reputations= * Jos√© Clemente Orozco * Diego Rivera * David Alfaro Siqueiros * Rufino Tamayo * Frida Kahlo =Others of note= Cubes by Javier Mar√≠n Old College of San Ildefonso. * Raul Anguiano, harmonic geometry, muralist and printmaker. * Gustavo Arias Murueta * Ignacio Barrios, watercolorist. * Federico Cant√∫, muralist, printmaker and sculptor. * Leonora Carrington, painter and novelist of English origin. * Mario Orozco Rivera, muralist and easel. * Joaqu√≠n Clausell, oil, Impressionist. * Miguel Cond√©, painter, draftsman and figurative recorder. * Vladimir Cora, painter and sculptor, oil, acrylic and enamel. * Pedro Coronel, painter, sculptor, draftsman and engraver abstract. * Rafael Coronel oil, melancholy painting. * Miguel Covarrubias, Art Deco cartoon. * Jos√© Luis Cuevas, painter, sculptor. * Gunther Gerzso, oil, pioneer of Mexican (Abstract Surrealism Expressionism). * Francisco Goitia, oil * Jorge Gonz√°lez Camarena, painter, sculptor and muralist. * Saturnino drawing, oil painting, frieze at the Palace of Fine Arts in Mexico city. * Mar√≠a Izquierdo, oil painting, surreal, muralist, first Mexican painter to exhibit in the US. * Gerardo Murillo Dr. Atl, Oil, (pioneer of \\"mural\\" in Mexico).

Popular arts and handcrafts Mural, \\"Pensamiento y alma huichol\\" (huichol thought and soul) by Santos de la Torre (1997) located at the Palais- Royal Mus√©e du Louvre station in Paris.

Mexican handcrafts and folk art, called artesan√≠a in Mexico, is a complex category of items made by hand or in small workshops for utilitarian, decorative, or other purposes. These include ceramics, wall hangings, certain types of paintings, and textiles. Like the more formal arts, artesan√≠a has both indigenous and European roots and is considered a valued part of Mexico's ethnic heritage. This linking among the arts and cultural identity was most strongly forged by the country's political, intellectual, and artistic elite in the first half of the 20th century, after the Mexican Revolution. Artists such as Diego Rivera, Rufino Tamayo, and Frida Kahlo used artesan√≠a as inspiration for a number of their murals and other works. Unlike the fine arts, artesan√≠a is created by common people and those of indigenous heritage, who learn their craft through formal or informal apprenticeship. The linking of artesan√≠a and Mexican identity continues through television, movies, and tourism promotion. La Calavera Catrina a zinc etching by the Mexican printmaker, cartoon illustrator and lithographer Jos√© Guadalupe Posada. Most of the artesan√≠a produced in Mexico consists of ordinary things made for daily use. They are considered artistic because they contain decorative details or are painted in bright colors, or both. The bold use of colors in crafts and other constructions extends back to pre-Hispanic times. These were joined by other colors introduced by European and Asian contact, always in bold tones. Design motifs vary from purely indigenous to mostly European with other elements thrown in. Geometric designs connected to Mexico's pre-Hispanic past are prevalent, and items made by the country's remaining purely indigenous communities. Motifs from nature are popular, possibly more so than geometric patterns in both pre-Hispanic and European designs. They are especially prevalent in wall-hangings and ceramics. One of the best of Mexico's handcrafts is Talavera pottery produced in Puebla. It has a mix of Chinese, Arab, Spanish, and indigenous design influences. The best known folk paintings are the ex-voto or retablo votive paintings. These are small commemorative paintings or other artwork created by a believer, honoring the intervention of a saint or other figure. The untrained style of ex-voto painting was appropriated during the mid-20th century by Kahlo, who believed they were the most authentic expression of Latin American art.

Inv. #287647. Fondo Casasola. SINAFO-Fototeca Nacional de INAH. Cinematography came to Mexico during the Mexican Revolution from the U.S. and France. It was initially used to document the battles of the war. Revolutionary general Pancho Villa himself starred in some silent films. In 2003, HBO broadcast And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself, with Antonio Banderas as Villa; the film focuses on the making of the film The Life of General Villa. Villa consciously used cinema to shape his public image.Deborah Mistron. \\"The Role of Pancho Villa in the Mexican and American Cinema.\\" Studies in Latin American Popular Culture 2:1-13 (1983). The first sound film in Mexico was made in 1931, called Desde Santa. The first Mexican film genre appeared between 1920 and 1940, called ranchero. Mexico has twice won the highest honor at the Cannes Film Festival, having won the Grand Prix du Festival International du Film for Mar√≠a Candelaria in 1946 and the Palme d'Or in 1961 for Viridiana, more than any other Latin American nation. While Mexico's Golden Age of Cinema is regarded as the 1940s and 1950s, two films from the mid to late 1930s, All√° en el Rancho Grande (1936) and V√°monos con Pancho Villa (1935), set the standard of this age thematically, aesthetically, and ideologically. These films featured archetypal star figures and symbols based on broad national mythologies. Some of the mythology according to Carlos Monsiv√°is, includes the participants in family melodramas, the masculine charros of ranchero films, femme fatales (often played by Mar√≠a F√©lix and Dolores del R√≠o), the indigenous peoples of Emilio Fern√°ndez's films, and Cantinflas's peladito (urban miscreant). Settings were often ranches, the battlefields of the revolution, and cabarets. Movies about the Mexican Revolution focused on the initial overthrow of the Porfirio D√≠az government rather than the fighting among the various factions afterwards. They also tended to focus on rural themes as \\"Mexican,\\" even though the population was increasingly urban.Strayer, 2009 p.7-12. Cineteca Nacional (The National film library). is an institution dedicated to the preservation, cataloging, exhibition and dissemination of cinema in Mexico. Mexico had two advantages in filmmaking during this period. The first was a generation of talented actors and filmmakers. These included actors such as Mar√≠a F√©lix, Jorge Negrete, Pedro Armend√°riz, Pedro Infante, Cantinflas, and directors such as Emilio \\"El Indio\\" Fernandez and cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa. Many of these starts had success in the United States and at the Cannes Film Festival . On the corner of La Brea and Hollywood Boulevard, there is a sculpture of four women who represent the four pillars of the cinema industry, one of whom is Mexican actress Dolores del R√≠o . Gabriel Figueroa is known for black-and- white camerawork that is generally stark and expressionist, with simple but sophisticated camera movement. The second advantage was that Mexico was not heavily involved in the Second World War, and therefore had a greater supply of celluloid for films, then also used for bombs. In the 1930s, the government became interested in the industry in order to promote cultural and political values. Much of the production during the Golden Age was financed with a mix of public and private money, with the government eventually taking a larger role. In 1942 the Banco Cinematogr√°fico financed almost all of the industry, coming under government control by 1947. This gave the government extensive censorship rights through deciding which projects to finance. While the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) censored films in many ways in the 1940s and 1950s, it was not as repressive as other Spanish speaking countries, but it played a strong role in how Mexico's government and culture was portrayed. The Golden Age ended in the late 1950s, with the 1960s dominated by poorly made imitations of Hollywood westerns and comedies. These films were increasingly shot outdoors and popular films featured stars from lucha libre. Art and experimental film production in Mexico has its roots in the same period, which began to bear fruit in the 1970s. Director Paul Leduc surfaced in the 1970s, specializing in films without dialogue. His first major success was with Reed: Insurgent Mexico (1971) followed by a biography of Frida Kahlo called Frida (1984). He is the most consistently political of modern Mexican directors. In the 1990s, he filmed Latino Bar (1991) and Dollar Mambo (1993). His silent films generally have not had commercial success. Amores perros won 11 Ariel Awards and the 2001 BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language. In the late 20th century the main proponent of Mexican art cinema was Arturo Ripstein Jr.. His career began with a spaghetti Western-like film called Tiempo de morir in 1965 and who some consider the successor to Luis Bu√±uel who worked in Mexico in the 1940s. Some of his classic films include El Castillo de la pureza (1973), Lugar sin limites (1977) and La reina de la noche (1994) exploring topics such as family ties and even homosexuality, dealing in cruelty, irony, and tragedy. State censorship was relatively lax in the 1960s and early 1970s, but came back during the latter 1970s and 1980s, monopolizing production and distribution. Faun face from Pan's Labyrinth displayed at Fantasy: Worlds of Myth and Magic, Experience Music Project/Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Seattle. Pan's Labyrinth a 2006 Mexican- Spanish dark fantasy drama film. Another factor was that many Mexican film making facilities were taken over by Hollywood production companies in the 1980s, crowding out local production. The quality of films was so diminished that for some of these years, Mexico's Ariel film award was suspended for lack of qualifying candidates. Popular filmmaking decreased but the art sector grew, sometimes producing works outside the view of censors such as Jorge Fons' 1989 film Rojo Amanecer on the 1968 Tlatelolco massacre. The movie was banned by the government but received support in Mexico and abroad. The film was shown although not widely. It was the beginning of more editorial freedom for filmmakers in Mexico. Roma was filmed. Roma became the first Mexican entry to win Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards. Starting in the 1990s, Mexican cinema began to make a comeback, mostly through co-production with foreign interests. One reason for international interest in Mexican cinema was the wild success of the 1992 film Como Agua Para Chocolate (Like Water for Chocolate). In 1993, this film was the largest grossing foreign language film in U.S. history and ran in a total of 34 countries. Since then, Mexican film divided into two genres. Those for a more domestic audience tend to be more personal and more ambiguously political such as Pueblo de Madera, La Vida Conjugal, and Angel de fuego. Those geared for international audiences have more stereotypical Mexican images and include S√≥lo con Tu Pareja, La Invencion de Cronos along with Como Agua para Chocolate. Mexico's newest generation of successful directors includes Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu, Guillermo del Toro, and Alfonso Cuar√≥n known as \\"The Three Amigos of Cinema\\". Films by this directors include Cuar√≥n's Gravity, del Toro's The Shape of Water and I√±√°rritu's Birdman. Film professionals in the early 21st century tend to be at least bilingual (Spanish and English) and are better able to participate in the global market for films than their predecessors.  Photography in Mexico  Maximilian and Charlotte ‚Äì Mexico 1857. Unknown photographer Photography came to Mexico in the form of daguerreotype about six months after its discovery, and it spread quickly. It was initially used for portraits of the wealthy (because of its high cost), and for shooting landscapes and pre-Hispanic ruins.Mraz, John. \\"Photography\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p.1085 Another relatively common type of early photographic portraits were those of recently deceased children, called little angels, which persisted into the first half of the 20th century. This custom derived from a Catholic tradition of celebrating a dead child's immediate acceptance into heaven, bypassing purgatory. This photography replaced the practice of making drawings and other depictions of them as this was considered a \\"happy occasion.\\" Formal portraits were the most common form of commercial photography through the end of the 19th century. Photo of the Metlac Bridge with train 1903, Guillermo Kahlo, photographer. Modern photography in Mexico did not begin as an art form, but rather as documentation, associated with periodicals and government projects. It dates to the Porfirio D√≠az period of rule, or the Porfiriato, from the late 19th century to 1910.Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.7. Porfirian-era photography was heavily inclined toward the presentation of the nation's modernization to the rest of the world, with Mexico City as its cultural showpiece. This image was European-based with some indigenous elements for distinction.Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.24. Stylized images of the indigenous during the Porfirato were principally done by Yba√±ez y Sora in the costumbrista painting style, which was popular outside of Mexico. One of most important photographers of the Porfiriato was Guillermo Kahlo, n√© Wilhelm. Kahlo established his own studio in the first decade of the 1900s and was hired by businesses and the government to document architecture, interiors, landscapes, and factories.Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.35. Another German-born photographer was Hugo Brehme, working at the same time as Kahlo. The two apparently did not get along, possibly since they were rivals for producing images of colonial-era buildings.De S√° Rego, Stella. \\"Hugo Brehme, Maker of Mythologies\\" in Timeless Mexico, p. 17. Kahlo's style reflected the narratives of the period, solely focusing on major constructions and events, and avoiding the common populace, rarely having people appear in his photos.Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.37. It avoided subjects that hinted at the political instability of the country at the time, such as strike actions.Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.26. One major Kahlo project was the Photographic Inventory of Spanish Colonial Church Architecture in Mexico (1910), which consisted of twenty-five albums sponsored by the federal government to document the remaining colonial architecture.Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.25. Kahlo's photography was used to link Mexico's pre-Hispanic and colonial past in their architecture, to Mexico's current progress, as shown in his photos of industry and infrastructure.Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.34. Zapatistas in Cuernavaca, 1911. Hugo Brehme, photographerDeGolyer Library, Southern Methodist University Another pioneer of Mexican photography was Agust√≠n Victor Casasola. Like Kahlo, he began his career in the Porfirato, but his career was focused on photography for periodicals. Again like Kahlo, Casasola's work prior to the Mexican Revolution focused on non-controversial photographs, focusing on the lives of the elite. The outbreak of civil war caused Casasola's choice of subject to change. He began to focus not only on portraits of the main protagonists (such as Francisco Villa) and general battle scenes, but on executions and the dead. He focused on people whose faces showed such expressions as pain, kindness, and resignation. His work during this time produced a large collection of photographs, many of which are familiar to Mexicans as they have been widely reprinted and reused, often without credit to Casasola. After the war, Casasola continued to photograph common people, especially migrants to Mexico City during the 1920s and 1930s. His total known archives comprise about half a million images with many of his works archived in the former monastery of San Francisco in Pachuca. A scene from the Decena Tr√°gica, February 1913, from the Casasola Archive Kahlo and Casasola are considered the two most important photographers to develop the medium in Mexico, with Kahlo defining architectural photography and Casasolas establishing photojournalism. Neither man thought of himself as an artist‚Äîespecially not Casasolas‚Äîwho thought of himself as a historian in the Positivist tradition, but the photography of both show attention to detail, lighting, and placement of subjects for emotional or dramatic effect.Cuevas- Wolf, 1997 p.9.Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.18-25. For the rest of the 20th century, most photography was connected to documentation. However, artistic trends from both inside and outside the country had an effect. In the 1920s, the dominant photographic style was Pictorialism, in which images had a romantic or dream- like quality due to the use of filters and other techniques. American Edward Weston broke with this tradition, taking these effects away for more realistic and detailed images. This caused a split in the photography world between Pictorialists and Realists both inside and outside of Mexico. Pancho Villa (left) \\"commander of the Divisi√≥n del Norte (North Division)\\", and Emiliano Zapata \\"Ej√©rcito Libertador del Sur (Liberation Army of the South)\\" in 1914. Villa is sitting in the presidential chair in the Palacio Nacional. By Agust√≠n Casasola. Weston and his Italian assistant Tina Modotti were in Mexico from 1923 to 1926, allying themselves with Mexican Realist photographers Manuel √Ålvarez Bravo as well as muralists such as Gabriel Fern√°ndez Ledesma. These photographers' political and social aspirations matched those of the muralist movement and the new post-Revolution government.Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.17-18. Mariana Yampolsky, originally from the U.S., became an important photographer in Mexico. Photography and other arts shifted to depictions of the country's indigenous heritage and the glorification of the Mexican common people. This was mainly to reject the elitist and heavily European values of the Porfiriato, along with the increasing cultural influence of the United States in favor of an \\"authentic\\" and distinct Mexican identity.Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.9-10. Another was the government's decision to use this imagery, rather than the still-fresh memories of the battles and atrocities of the Revolution to promote itself.Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.27. Woman from Tehuantepec (Mexico), photograph by Tina Modotti. Manuel Alvarez Bravo experimented with abstraction in his photography and formed his own personal style concerned with Mexican rites and customs. He was active from the 1920s until his death in the 1990s. Like other artists of the 20th century, he was concerned with balancing international artistic trends with the expression of Mexican culture and people. His photographic techniques were concerned with transforming the ordinary into the fantastic. From the end of the 1930s to the 1970s his photography developed along with new technologies such as color, using the same themes. In the 1970s, he experimented with female nudes. These post- Revolution photographers influenced the generations after them, but the emphasis remained on documentary journalism, especially for newspapers. For this reason, the focus remained on social issues. This included work by Nacho L√≥pez and Hector Garcia, best known for their photography of the student uprising of 1968. The \\"Z√≥calo\\" in Mexico City in 1968 During the 1970s, a fusion of various styles retained a social focus. During the same period, institutions were established that dedicated themselves to the promotion of photography and conservation of photographs, such as the Centro de la Imagen, the Fototeca Nacional del INAH, and the publication Luna C√≥rnea. Photography in Mexico from the latter 20th century on remains mostly focused on photojournalism and other kinds of documentary. Francisco Mata de Rosas is considered the most notable photographer in contemporary Mexico mostly working with documentaries. He has published a number of books including M√©xico Tenochtitlan and Tepito, Bravo el Barrio. Eniac Mart√≠nez specializes in panoramas. Patricia Aridjis works with social themes, mostly to illustrate books. Gerardo Montiel Klint's work has been described as a \\"shadowing and dark world\\", focusing on the angst and violence of adolescents. The most recent generation of photographers work with new and digital technologies. One of these is Javier Orozco who specializes in interiors. However, purely artistic photography has had an impact. In 2002, a photographic exhibit by Daniela Rossell featured images of Mexican multimillionaires posing in their ostentatious homes, filled with expensive paintings, hunting trophies, crystal chandeliers, gold lam√© wallpaper, and household help. The photographs set off a wave of social criticism as well as tabloid gossip.Gallo, 2004 p.47.

Goals and methods The goal of the Coalition is to reverse the pattern of net land loss in coastal Louisiana and to reestablish a sustainable balance to its geologic processes and communities. In pursuit of this goal, the Coalition advocates for the implementation of sustainable coastal policies and monitors coastal activities to ensure that stringent regulations and enforcement policies are maintained. The Coalition facilitates and funds restoration activity and work diligently to raise awareness and educate the public about the importance of restoring and preserving coastal Louisiana. CRCL is an organization dedicated to the stewardship of one of the world's greatest natural, cultural, and economic treasures - the bays, wetlands, and estuaries of coastal Louisiana. The Coalition is made up of a wide spectrum of organizations and individuals - conservationists, businesses, local governments, landowners, civic organizations, religious groups, commercial and recreational fishers, scientists, teachers, and concerned individuals. Coalition history The idea for the Coalition originated in 1985 and was recognized as a not-for- profit organization in 1988. Soon after being founded, the organization published \\"Coastal Louisiana: Here Today and Gone Tomorrow?\\" The document shifted the focus from documenting wetland loss to proposing a plan of action for restoration. The Coalition's first major initiative was to seek and secure a commitment from the State of Louisiana to make coastal restoration a top priority. The organization simultaneously realized two of their objectives outlined in \\"Here Today and Gone Tomorrow?\\" when in 1989 Louisiana voters approved Act 6 charging the state with conserving, restoring, creating and enhancing vegetated wetlands in coastal Louisiana. Act 6 also created the Governor's office of Coastal Activities and the State Wetlands Trust Fund. Having secured a state commitment to the conservation of coastal Louisiana, the Coalition focused its attention on securing a federal commitment. The Coalition developed a national plan called \\"Save the Wetlands\\" which sought to gain the passage of national legislation that would commit federal funding and assistance to coastal restoration projects. As a result of their efforts, Congress passed the Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection and Restoration Act (CWPPRA). Also known as the Breaux Act, this piece of legislation acknowledged the productive capabilities and fragility of Louisiana coastal wetlands and provided expenditure of federal funds on a joint state and federal protection and restoration project. In 1995, the organization sponsored Coastal Summit '95 and published Coast Watchers guide and started producing public service announcements, Coastal Minutes. In 1996, Governor Mike Foster announced his commitment to add state general funds to the coastal restoration trust fund to match all available federal funds. In 1997, CRCL helped create a national network called Restore America's Estuaries to advocate for the national wetlands recognition with a goal of restoring one million acres of estuarine habitat, half of which will be in Louisiana. [Coast 2050: Toward a Sustainable Coast] was adopted in 1998 at the explicit urging of CRCL.

Kennedy in June 1968, with the majority of the mini-series focusing on the Kennedy Administration (1961‚Äì1963). Other sub-plots include Bobby Kennedy's frustration with his elder brother's politically risky womanizing and his often turbulent relationship with Hoover and the Civil Rights leadership of the era. The mini- series also touches on the alleged bargains Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. made with Mafia figures in order to get his son elected to the U.S. Presidency.

Sten & Lex have been doing stencils on the street since 2000/2001 and today their work is part of the urban landscape in London, Paris, Barcelona, New York City, and in their home town of Rome. During that early period in Rome, and Italy in general, there wasn't a strong stencil culture such as there was in France, and Sten & Lex are seen by many as the pioneers of \\"Stencil Graffiti\\" in Italy and were the first to be considered \\"stencil artists\\". All the work of Sten & Lex results from an individual path that developed far from art academies and design institutes and far from a classic writing and graffiti background. The duo are best known in the history of stencil-making for introducing the halftone stencil technique, in which the greater part of their stencil portraits is composed of thousands of lines. They usually produce portraits of anonymous people they have photographed themselves or found in family photos album. In 2008, they took part in the Cans Festival : Banksy invited thirty-nine artists from around the world, including, Prism, Blek, Faile, Vhils, Vexta, to exhibit their work in an abandoned tunnel near Leake Street in South East London.Banksy, Sten, Lex, Cans Festival, London 2008 In 2009, they started producing what they call \\"Stencil Poster\\".The technique derives from the union of two of the main techniques of street art: Stencil and Poster. They glue a stencil cut from paper on the wall and paint over it. They then destroy the matrix and apply its scraps to the wall, thus allowing them to become part of the work itself. The bits of matrix applied to the wall wear out over time, producing work in a state of constant change. Unlike stencil work in general, the images thus created cannot be reproduced, rendering each piece original and unique. A book documenting this technique entitled \\"Stencil Poster\\" was published in 2009 by Drago. In 2011, they entered the contemporary art world with large-scale pieces in museums, such as the Museum of Contemporary Art of Rome (MACRO) in Rome, Italy and the Carandente Museum in Spoleto, Italy. That same year, they participated in major international festivals, such as the \\"Walk This Way\\" Festival in Koge, Denmark and the \\"Nuart\\" Festival in Stavanger, Norway, contributing to the growth of their fame and popularity. 2012 saw the production of monumental projects that led to Sten Lex being recognized as emerging artists increasingly in demand. They were invited to the \\"Living Walls\\" show in Atlanta, USA; the Centre de la Gravure et de l‚ÄôImage imprim√©e in La Louvi√®re, Belgium, as well as to the \\"Outer Spaces\\" outdoor show in Poznan, Poland and the \\"Open Walls\\" in Baltimore, USA. In 2012, they also presented their work in a large solo show at the Magda Danysz Gallery in Paris. The Shanghai, China branch of the same gallery granted them another solo show in the Spring of 2013, referring to the duo as among \\"the most innovative at the moment.\\"http://www.magda-gallery.com/en/sten-lex-shanghai- solo-show In anticipation of their solo show at Rome's \\"Wunderkammern\\" gallery in January 2015, AGRPress referred to them as \\"among the most internationally recognized Italian street artists.\\" In 2017 StenLex worked with Distrito Tec , M√©xico to do what it is considered the world's largest stencil. Their work consists of four thousand square meters of surface. Specifically, 1,952 square meters of black and white paint, plus 1,600 square meters of paper strips. The curatorship of the six works that make up the project is in charge of the art and design agency ARTO Studio.

In October 1983, the name of the store was changed to Brake Masters, and in May 1984, the company opened a second store. A third store opened in March 1989, and the company decided to expand into other markets. Its first franchise store opened in Sierra Vista in August 1994. Brake Masters specializes in brake repair, offering installation of many replacement parts, including water pumps, starters, alternators, CV boots, U-joints and axles. Other services include oil changes, tire rotation, radiator, brake and transmission fluid exchanges, belts, hoses, batteries and air conditioning service and replacement.

Set adrift 62-year-old Pham set out from Long Beach, California on his 26-foot sail boat Sea Breeze (a Columbia 26 Mark I) heading for Catalina Island in late May 2002 - which should have taken about three hours. He lived on the boat in between fishing trips. During the journey he claimed a sudden storm wrecked his mast and ruined his outboard motor. It later transpired he did not have a working VHF radio on board his boat. As he had no family, and had not filed a float plan, he was not reported missing. Pham said he had survived on fish and birds and drinking rain water caught in a five-gallon bucket. He had caught turtles and used meat to trap sea birds such as cormorants. Using evaporated sea water he was able to preserve the meat he caught. Pham's boat did have solar power installed which allowed him to watch videos on a small television. Pham's battered and broken sail boat (taken from USS McClusky) Rescue He was initially found by a US Customs P-3 Orion drug-hunting plane that alerted a US Navy frigate USS McClusky to Pham's position and he was rescued on 17 September 2002. His boat was then 480 km (300 miles) off Costa Rica and 4,000 km (2,500 miles) away from his starting point. Lieutenant of the US Navy said: \\"When we got to him, he was grilling a seagull on a grill that he had, the fuel that he was using to cook was the wood from his own boat\\". Pham's weight had dropped while adrift but a medical aboard the McClusky concluded Pham was in pretty good shape considering his almost four months at sea. The US Navy sank his boat and the crew of the McClusky paid for Pham to fly from Guatemala (where he had been dropped off at Puerto Quetzal) to Los Angeles, arriving on 24 September 2002. He had on him his green card travel document issued in 1976. Controversy A number of sailing commentators have voiced concerns about the apparent length of Pham's period adrift.http://www.latitude38.com/LectronicLat/2002/Sept2002/Sept27/Sept27.html Pham insists he never saw a plane or another boat during his odyssey but given the busy nature of the California coast some people find this hard to believe as the area between Long Beach and Catalina Island is one of the busiest off the US coast.

Life  He was the eldest son of the Count Philip VII of Waldeck-Wildungen (1613‚Äì1645) and his wife Anna Catherine of Sayn-Wittgenstein (1610‚Äì1690) and is the ancestor of all living Princes and Counts of Waldeck. The Arolsen princely house stems from his first marriage, while the Waldeck-Bergheim line, which resides in Bergheim near Bad Wildungen and died out in the male line in 1966, stems from his second marriage via his son Josias I. After his father's death in 1645 Christian Louis inherited the county of Waldeck-Wildungen. His education and the regency until 1660 were in the hands of his mother and Henry Wolrad, a cousin of his father. Christian Louis later resided mostly at Christiansburg Castle, which he had built in Kleinern, near Wildungen. On 12 June 1685, he closed an inheritance treaty with his cousin Count George Frederick of Waldeck- Eisenberg, which introduced the primogeniture in the house of Waldeck. When George Frederick died in 1692, Christian Louis inherited Waldeck-Eisenberg, thereby reuniting Waldeck in one hand for the first time since 1397. With Waldeck-Eisenberg, he also inherited the County of Pyrmont. In 1695, he moved his residence to Bad Arolsen and in 1696, he moved the county's Chancellary from Korbach to Mengeringhausen. Christian inherited a claim to a share of the County of Rappoltstein in the Alsace from his first wife. He could not enforce this claim, but he nevertheless added the arms of Rappoltstein to his coat of arms and he and his successors added \\"Count of Rappoltstein\\" to their titles. Christian Louis was a successful soldier and rose to the rank of Field Marshal. During his reign, witch trials took place in Wildungen from 1650 to 1664, and again from 1660 to 1662. Witch hunts had happened before in Waldeck, from 1629 to 1632 under Count Christian I.

Originally, the Chinese government proposed a rail connection between Kunming, China and Kyaukpyu, Myanmar. The railway was planned to follow the route of the existing Sino-Myanmar pipelines. After protests in Myanmar, the part of the railway in Myanmar was cancelled. Only the Chinese part of the line between Dali and Ruili will now be constructed. Construction on the Darui Line began in 2008. In August 2012, the project received an additional investment of ¬•5 billion, owing to the difficulty of tunneling through the rugged terrain, particularly the tunnel across the Dazhushan Mountain. The huge rivers and geology have given the corridor the moniker World's Most Difficult Railway.

An earlier name for this tobacco factory was Imperia Regia Manifattura d'Austria-Ungheria (translation: Imperial and Royal Tobacco Manufacturing of the Austro-Hungerian Empire). Origins Main entrance (north) Secondary north entrance East side North side The decision to build a tobacco factory in Borgo Sacco (a former city new incorporated into Rovereto, Province of Trento, Italy) began in the middle of the 1800s in the context of a high level of unemployment resulting from a crisis in the silk production sector. Borgo Sacco was situated in the middle of an area dedicated to tobacco cultivation. The cultivation and processing of tobacco had begun toward the end of the 1500s around so called \\"masere\\", a form of centralized farming. With the construction of the Borgo Sacco plant, the surrounding area of Vallagarina became strongly oriented to manufacturing. On March 20, 1851, an agreement was signed between the Austrian Royal Ministry of Finance and the Municipality of Sacco headed by Antonio Gasperini. The total cost of the project was enormous: 175.000 crowns. Borgo Sacco provided the land and the materials, but even nearby Rovereto participated by donating 4,000 florins and potable water equivalent to 1,600 florins. The mechanical power needed to move the machines came from a water wheel moved by an underground water channel that passed through the factory. The construction work on the Borgo Sacco Royal Tobacco Factory began in the same year. The factory was built on the plans of engineer Latzel of the Viena public works administration and the construction was directed by Giovanni Smith e Giovanni Rezzori. Start of production The Manifattura began production in 1854-1855 with two laboratories of 220 workers each. Production began around four products: the Virginia cigar, sniffing tobacco, tobacco extract made from residues, and hand-rolled cigarettes (This was an experimental product that was quickly dropped). Before the First World War (1914‚Äì1918) the cigar plan was one of the most important in Austria, especially renowned for its production of Virginia cigars. For several decades, the Manifattura Tabacchi was one of the most important industries in Trentino, with the highest employment capacity around. It was also a place of many social innovations, often begun by women workers who were in the majority. The first employer provided nursery was established, as well as an emergency loans bank. Even the first workers union was formed inside the walls of the Manifattura. World War I and after During World War I, Manifattura Tabacchi was heavily damaged and production, including employees, was transferred to Austrian factories in Linz and in Bohemia. At the end of the war, Trentino province became part of Italy and Manifattura Tabacchi came under the direction of the state monopoyi. When the factory reopened on March 19, 1919, all 1,400 workers who were in service before the conflict were rehired. In the following years, production increased substantially thanks to gradual improvements to processes. This led to a drop in employment to around 700 in 1935 in contrast to nearly 2000 at the start of the century. In the same years, the popularity of the Manifattura Tabacchi grew considerably thanks to promotional activities using the designs of Fortunato Depero, the celebrated artist from Rovereto. World War II and later changes Throughout World War II, production continued despite bombings which did force production to the underground floor of the main building. Damage to the factory was not extensive. In 1948 a new expansion and modernization plan led the way to modern production methods. Cigar production was halted in 1953 and the factory was reoriented toward cigarettes. In the 1960s, tobacco production declined in Vallagarina, the area around Borgo Sacco and Rovereto. Previously it had been the source of about 70% of the tobacco used in production at Manifattura. In 1969 Manifattura Tabacci began to produce for Philip Morris. The following year a new, highly mechanized production facility was opened in an area next to the old factory. The Borgo Sacco factory worked with 22 \\"Standard\\" machines made in the USA and 13 cigarette packaging machines to produce 120 packets of cigarettes per minute. A tobacco chopping machine of that era made 1,200 cuts per minute. In the succeeding decade occupation stabilized at 700 employees. Progressive mechanization of production processes meant that men became the higher share of employees. Recent years The relationship between Philip Morris and the State Monopoly continued until 2000 when Manifattura Tabacchi became property of the Ente Tabacchi Italiani (ETI, the national tobacco agency). ETI was founded in August 1998, but by 2000 became a private company. In 2003, as part of the privatized ETI, Manifattura Tabacchi of Borgo Sacco was sold to British Italian Tobacco, the Italian branch of British American Tobacco (BAT). Following loss of production quotas for Philip Morris, Manifattura Tabacchi continued to shed employees. In 1999 the factory had 270 workers, but by 2004, they were just 154. Production stopped permanently on March 31, 2008, when BAT decided to concentrate production in Lecce, Italy, and chose to close Borgo Sacco's Manifattura Tabacchi. The main reason was that closing a factory in Trento would have had less negative impact with respect to closing a factory elsewhere. Redevelopment The autonomous Province of Trento created Manifattura domani in 2009 to create and manage a clean technology hub. It is a private company held by Trentino Sviluppo, the economic development agency of the Province of Trento. The company set up Progetto Manifattura - Green Innovation Factory to transform the 9-hectare (22-acre) historic tobacco facility into a business, innovation and research hub for green building, renewable energy, and environmental technology.

JMA Ventures, owner of the Homewood Mountain Resort on the west shore of Lake Tahoe, purchased Alpine Meadows from Powdr Corporation in July 2007. In 2011, Alpine Meadows merged with the well-known neighboring ski resort and 1960 Olympic site, Squaw Valley. Ownership transferred largely to the umbrella company Squaw Valley Ski Holdings, LLC. In 2018, this was merged into the Alterra Mountain Company. Today, the two resorts operate as one with a single-season pass and a connecting shuttle for visitors, the Squaw/Alpine Express, though each retains its distinct identity. History Peak of Summit Chair Alpine Bowl Chairlift Alpine Meadows opened in 1961. John Reily developed it initially as the Ward Peak Ski Resort, and had a vision to develop the terrain into a ski resort as an alternative to Squaw Valley. With the help of Peter Klaussen and a number of families who pooled resources to develop the area, Alpine Meadows was founded in 1958 and opened in 1961. The idea for the resort was to focus more on the pleasure of skiing than business profit. It was thought that the idea for the resort came about after the resort‚Äôs founders visited Squaw Valley during the 1960 Olympics and noticed the potential of the adjacent terrain. Alpine Meadows opened for the 1961‚Äì62 season with three lifts. The resort made headlines in 1982 after an early spring avalanche hit its base area in the late afternoon of March 31 and killed seven. One survivor was buried for five days.

He is known for vibrant paintings (close to expressionism) where mysticism is also often present. alt= Mintchine was born in Kyiv where at only 13 he was an apprenticed to a goldsmith. He began painting from the age of 16 and studied at the Kyiv Art College (together with Josyf Weissblatt, Olexandr Tyshler) and at Olexandra Exter. Later on he left Ukraine for Berlin in 1923. In Berlin he designed sets and costumes for the Jewish theatre. At the time of his first exhibition in Berlin he displayed artwork in a style close to Cubism (only one painting from this period is known). Mintchine most prolific and self-defining period started when he arrived in Paris around 1925. There he developed an exalted style, through dense and vibrant compositions. Abraham Mintchine life was not easy. In extreme poverty and married with a child, he nonetheless succeeded to develop a very characteristic style. On a number of occasions, Mintchine integrates mysticism in his compositions (often representations of Angels or angelic elements such as wings). Later, in 1929, the famous art dealer Ren√© Gimpel identified Mintchine as a \\"genius\\" painter and start buying all his paintings. About Mintchine's condition, he wrote in his journal: \\"he barely managed to scrape a 100 sous to live on; he wouldn't eat, and, dying of hunger would say to his wife: Eat, Mintchine isn't hungry.\\"Ren√© Gimpel, Diary of an Art Dealer, (new edn.

Ten seasons of excavations (state 1999) produced 347 stratified vessels, which were included within the Chocolate-on-White Ware group as satisfying a number of listed criteria.Fischer, Peter M. [1999], \\"Chocolate-on-White Ware: Typology, Chronology and Provenance - The Evidence from Tell Abu al-Kharaz, Jordan Valley\\", BASOR 313 [1999], pp. 1‚Äì29.Tell el-‚ÄôAjjul excavations. Season 2000, Preliminary Results -- Peter Fischer. Swedish Archaeology in Jordan, Palestine and Cyprus. Most of the bichrome-decorated and monochrome-decorated Chocolate- on-White Ware vessels were bowls, chalices, goblets, kraters, juglets and jugs, and jars. The wares were confirmed in Phases IV/1 and 2, V and VI and include six sub-groups: *Proto-Chocolate-on-White Bichrome Ware, *Chocolate- on-White Bichrome Ware, *Eggshell Ware, and *Chocolate-on-White I, II and III. Chronology The chronological framework, which is supported by radiocarbon dates and cross-references with Cyprus, shows that the ware was produced from the late Middle Bronze Age IIB until the beginning of the Late Bronze Age IB. Trade and the possible provenance of the different wares have been considered by excavators. The petrographically analysed pottery samples point to two production areas: the Central Jordan Valley, and southern Lebanon. The pottery included both burnished and unburnished bichrome-decorated types. Chocolate- on-white ware has been found at sites in Lebanon, Israel, Jordan and Palestine; there is no confirmed find of such pottery on Cyprus or in the Aegean.The investigation of Chocolate-on-White Ware. √ñsterreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften -- P.M.

The original house can be traced to the Domesday survey. He was schooled at Eton College like his elder brother John Ruggles-Brise and joined the 104th (Essex Yeomanry) Field Brigade RA. In 1940, he was sent for Commando training to Scotland, where he met his future wife Elizabeth Knox, and they married soon after. As a captain, he departed with No 7 Commando for North Africa, where he was captured during the raid on Bardia in 1941. He was handed over to the Italians and transferred to Naples by ship. As a prisoner of war, he was held at camp PG35 at Padula near Salerno from May 1942 until June 1943. After the Allies invaded Italy, he was sent to PG19 camp further north at Bologna before being transferred to Castello di Vincigliata PG12 in the latter days before the Italian armistice. The castle held some the highest ranking British and Commonwealth officers captured in the war, many during the campaigns in North Africa. They included Lieutenant General Sir Philip Neame VC, Air Marshal Owen Tudor Boyd, General Sir Richard O'Connor, as well as an old school-friend, Daniel Knox, 6th Earl of Ranfurly. He was amongst the small party, including some NCOs, released by General Chiappe in September 1943. They were driven to Firenze Campo di Marte railway station from where a special train took them to Arezzo. The party eventually dispersed and spent many months with the partisans in the Apennines. He eventually made it to a safehouse with other Allied personnel. He and others from the safehouse including Rudolph Vaughan, John Combe, Ted Todhunter, Dan Ranfurly from Vincigliata, American diplomat Walter Orebaugh and American pilot Jack Reiter who had been shot down over Italy and had escaped from a military hospital to join the partisans, managed to reach the coast and put out to sea in a boat, which began to leak badly. After rowing and bailing for 24 hours, they were at last picked up by an Italian vessel which landed them at Ancona, from where they were shipped to brigade HQ on 30 May 1944. Lady Ranfurly featured this incident in her book of memoirs, To War with Whitaker.To War with Whitaker: The wartime diaries of the Countess of Ranfurly 1939-45, Heinemann, London, 1994, p. 241 After the war, he became a member of the London Stock Exchange, a senior partner with Wontner, Dolphin & Francis, and a consultant with Brewin Dolphin & Co. He was High Sheriff of Essex (1967-68) and Vice-Chairman of Riding for Disabled Trust. He later bought an estate in Achnasheen, Scotland where he enjoyed the country life and deer stalking. His wife Elizabeth died in 1988 and he married Christine Margaret Fothergill-Spencer in 1994. He died at the age of 86. He was survived by his second wife and three sons from his first marriage.

Abu Hamza was to provide funds and experienced trainers. Uyaama was to provide a safe location for the camp, weapons and the American recruits. KOMO News reported, \\"According to court records, the whole setup was a hustle by petty crook James Ujaama of Seattle.\\" Swedish citizen Oussama Kassir and british Haroon Rashid Aswat, two men who said they had attended training camps in Afghanistan, were to be the camp's trainers. When the two men arrived to set up the camp in December 1999, they found there were just two recruits, Sami Osman and his teenage brother-in-law. They found Ujaama had supplied just two old guns and inadequate housing. Ujaama abandoned the camp and the men, the night of the complaint-filled day they arrived. At Kassir's trial, he and Aswat were described as trying to provide training to Osman and his brother-in-law, until they got a phone call from al Masri. Because they feared al Masri's phone call had been monitored, and had tipped off the American officials, they too fled the camp. In fact, American security officials had been monitoring the developing plans since the first contact between al Masri and Ujaam. According to American law enforcement officials who tried to extradite al Masri, he could have faced a sentence of 100 years. In return for pleading guilty to providing material support for terrorism, and agreeing to cooperate in helping to convict the British men, Ujaama received a two-year sentence. The owner of the ranch and his wife were believed to have been unaware of any criminal or terrorist connection, and were not charged.

Active in the 1970s and early 1980s, she is probably best known for her role as Officer Bonnie Clark on the television series CHiPs, a role she played from 1979 to 1982. Married to actor Gregory Harrison since 1980, Oakes retired from acting when their first child was born in 1985. Early life Oakes was born in Sumner, Iowa, and grew up in tiny Randalia, Iowa. While in high school, she went to Des Moines, Iowa, twice a week to attend modeling school. Oakes was named Miss Iowa Model of the Year and moved to New York City with a modeling contract at age 17. She quickly became one of the top fashion models in the United States. While modeling, she was in a relationship with pro football star Joe Namath for seven years and was sometimes referred to as \\"Joe's fiancee\\". Oakes began a shift from modeling to acting when, at the age of 23, she overheard one model tell another, \\"You know, you're kind of a young Randi Oakes.\\" Acting career Oakes was a frequent guest star on television series during the late 1970s and early 1980s, including roles on McCloud, Delvecchio, Switch, B. J. and the Bear, Barnaby Jones, The Love Boat and Fantasy Island. She also starred as Sally in the 1978 theatrical crime drama Acapulco Gold and had recurring roles as Georgia on the 1977 television series Rosetti and Ryan and as a young Taurus woman on the original Battlestar Galactica. A guest role as a car thief in the episode \\"Down Time\\" on CHiPs led to the featured role as the blonde police officer Bonnie Clark that made her a household name. She appeared on the series from the beginning of its third season until the end of its fifth season. Along with costar Larry Wilcox, Oakes left the show in 1982. According to a 1983 article that appeared in People, a lack of time spent with husband Gregory Harrison led to the actress's departure from CHiPs. Oakes appeared on multiple editions of Circus of the Stars and was a frequent competitor on (and one-time host of) Battle of the Network Stars. Her claim to fame in the latter is that she was \\"dunked\\" more times than any other competitor in the Baseball Dunk event. She retired from acting to be a full-time mother after the birth of her first child in 1985. As of 2015, Oakes returned to television, with other notable CHiPs stars, for a series of introductions and interviews for MeTV's weekly CHiPs reruns. Family While competing on a 1979 edition of Battle of the Network Stars, Oakes (on the NBC team) met her future husband, actor Gregory Harrison of Trapper John, M.D. fame (playing for the CBS team). Oakes and Harrison were married on December 21, 1980, although their marriage was kept secret from the public for several years. Together, they have three daughters, Emma Lee (born 1985), Lily Anne (born 1989), and Kate (born 1991). The couple also adopted a son, Quinn Edgar. The couple originally lived together in Sherman Oaks, California, but since the early 1990s the family has lived in Southern Oregon; first in Gold Beach for 15 years then relocating to Eugene.

The king's actual funerary temple Henkhet-Ankh was located a short distance away, a little to the south of the entrance to Deir el Bahari and adjacent to the hill of Gurna. The temple probably played an important role within the \\"Beautiful Feast of the Valley\\", presumably being intended to receive the barque of the god during its travels and thereby supersede the Temple of Hatshepsut in one of its intended functions. Small in size compared to the other complexes erected earlier at Deir el-Bahari (some 40 metres N-S x 45 metres E-W), the temple is located on a small elevated terrace to the immediate north-west of the funerary temple of Mentuhotep II, and therefore positioned tightly between it and the temple of Hatshepsut immediately to the north-east. The larger part of the temple is positioned above the level of the upper terrace of the temple of Hatshepsut and rests on a roughly square platform partially cut from the rock and partially constructed of loose stones, supported by a stone revetment. No evidence exists for previous construction on this site. Constructed of both sandstone and limestone, the temple's erection was supervised by the high official Rekhmire, vizier to Thutmose III, during the last decade of the king's reign. Documentary evidence - in the form of a series of limestone ostraka found at the site and published by W.C. Hayes [1960] - reveals that construction began in regnal year 43 and was probably not finished by regnal year 54 when Thutmose III died. The temple was likely then brought to completion by his successor Amenhotep II, in the early years of his reign. Despite the clear existence of a causeway leading up to the site, the temple remained hidden from archaeologists until the 1960s as the result of an ancient rock fall from the high cliffs above - scholars have posited the temple's almost complete destruction by landslide towards the end of the 20th Dynasty, some 250 years after its completion. Thereafter, the site was apparently plundered of its sandstone building blocks for the construction of other projects. Completing the temple's devastation was the eventual collapse of the built-up portion of its supporting platform, causing the south-eastern corner of the temple to precipitate on to the Temple of Montuhotep immediately below. Relief fragments from the Djeser-Akhet were subsequently discovered amongst the rubble in the temple of Mentuhotep II by the Egypt Exploration Society excavators, conveniently foreshadowing the temple's re-discovery by the Poles several decades later.  Conservation and reconstruction works  The reconstruction of the temple‚Äôs layout was hindered by the large scale of destruction. However, the plan of the upper terrace could be reconstructed thanks to the outlines of walls visible on the remains of pavements and the partly-preserved column bases and shafts. Tens of thousands of relief fragments and wall inscriptions were excavated, as well as statuettes, steles of dignitaries of the New Kingdom, and sculptures depicting the ruler, including a 2-m-tall stone statue of Tuthmosis III. The work of the PCMA UW expedition, resumed in 1978 and continued to the present day in cooperation with National Museum in Warsaw and Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities, focuses on reconstructing the relief and architectural decoration and protecting the polychromies, as well as documenting them. Until 1996, Jadwiga Lipi≈Ñska headed the team; since 2008, Monika Doli≈Ñska directs the work. The team is preparing a monograph on the temple reliefs to emphasize their uniqueness and the need for further conservation.

Biography Early life Louis Stulberg emigrated with his parents from Poland to Canada in 1904. In 1915, he became a cutter and joined Local 83 of the ILGWU. He graduated from the Harbord Collegiate Institute in Toronto in 1918, and the next year, he moved to the United States. Stulberg first moved to Chicago, where he attended school, worked as a cutter, and joined ILGWU Local 81. Stulberg moved around the country, working as a cutter and union organizer in Toledo, Ohio, and Chicago (1924‚Äì1927). He also played minor league baseball for the Memphis Chicks, a charter member team of the Southern Association. Work with the ILGWU It was in New York that he finally settled, first working as business agent and assistant manager of Local 10 (1929‚Äì1945), then as manager of Local 62 (1947‚Äì1956). Stulberg began service at the international level as Assistant General Secretary (1945), followed by the positions of Vice President (1947), Executive Vice President (1956), and General Secretary Treasurer (1959). He was elected president of the union in 1966, succeeding David Dubinsky, and served until his retirement in 1975. As president of the ILGWU, Stulberg became involved in national and international labor organization. In the United States, Stulberg was elected as a vice president and executive council member of the AFL-CIO. Internationally, he served on a United States delegation to the United Nations (1968), an AFL-CIO delegation to the British Trades Union Congress (1972). Still, Stulberg's term was an inward-looking time, after the long tenure of David Dubinsky. A demographic shift in ILGWU membership, from largely Jewish and Italian workers to more Hispanic and African-American workers, had begun under Dubinsky, but accelerated rapidly during Stulberg's term. During this period, the ILGWU focused more heavily on organizing, and membership reached an all-time high in 1968. But by 1970, it had begun to fall dramatically, as more clothing manufacturers moved their operations abroad. The union also shed many of its political connections under Stulberg's leadership. In 1968 he led the union out of the Liberal Party of New York State, which it had helped to found, and he severed the ILGWU's ties to the Americans for Democratic Action.

Milakpur comes under Hisar (Lok Sabha constituency), which is represented in Lok Sabha by Dushyant Chautala of INLD. The village serves under the jurisdiction of Bhiwani Administration under police station at Bawani Khera, which also serves as Tehsil to the village. Location The Bus stand of the village caters to the needs of more than six villages and the village railway station, Aurangnagar, also provides for surrounding villages. Economy The area is known for its large number of brick kilns, which cater to the demand of bricks from surrounding areas and other areas as far flung as Bhiwani and Hisar. However, the residents are not concerned about the pollution and ecological devastation caused by them, perhaps due to lack of environmental awareness. Indeed, not even the authorities are concerned by their detrimental effect on the ecology and the environment of the area. Like most of the villages in Haryana, Milakpur too has made a big contribution towards the Indian Army as soldiers and officers. Though the former outnumber the latter when quantified. Lack of other economic avenues and poor quality education lead to this choice rather than strong feelings of nationalism and patriotism. In addition to a career in the army, other occupations range from brick kiln management, farming, labour, teaching, to Mom and pop shop management. Of these, farming remains the largest and the default source of livelihood. Education Hansi,a town just six kilometers away, exerts significant urban influence upon the village. Increased educational awareness among the people has resulted in a more proactive stance towards education for their wards. In their quest for quality education, the number of pupils attending English medium schools in surrounding urban areas has increased significantly, despite the expensive fees in comparison to the overlooking free state-run schools where only children of under-privileged families find way. Indeed, the quality of state-run schools is so severely worse than urban schools that children from a poorer socio-economic background, who cannot afford urban schools, are compelled to go to private village schools. The quality of education of these schools is questionable and they have nothing in the name of infrastructure. Sanitation facilities are rare. This clearly indicates the shoddy state of education in the area and brings into light the bogus claims of improving quality of education made by the polity. The poor quality of education, in conjunction with other factors, contributes to the sheer prevalence of inequality among people, at large.

Found by Pierre Montet at Byblos necropolis in 1923, on display at the Louvre Museum. Tell el-Yahudiyeh Ware juglets. Rockefeller Museum Israel Tell el-Yahudiyeh Ware or Tell el- Yahudiya ware (often abbreviated TEY) is a distinctive ceramic ware of the late Middle Bronze Age / Second Intermediate Period. The ware takes its name from its type site at Tell el-Yahudiyeh in the eastern Nile Delta of ancient Egypt, and is also found in a large number of Levantine and Cypriot sites. It was first recognised as a distinctive ware by Sir Flinders Petrie during his excavation of the type site. The ware first appears in strata dating to the MBIIA period, reaching the peak of its popularity in the MBIIB-C periods when it is encountered very frequently in contemporaneous Canaanite and Delta sites. The last vestigial expressions of this ware die out during the LBI period. Tell el-Yehudiyeh Ware forms a very useful diagnostic indicator for the MBIIB-C period especially. In the Nile delta it is often considered to mark the presence of the Hyksos invaders. Many ceramicists see the form of the Tell el-Yehudiyeh juglet as being firmly grounded in earlier Canaanite ceramic traditions, able to be traced back to earlier prototypes such as the juglets from Tomb A at Jericho.Ruth Amiran (1970), Ancient Pottery of the Holy Land, Rutgers University Press, p. 120. Fabric and technique The clay used in Tell el-Yehudiyeh Ware is normally grey or light-brown in colour, with numerous gritty inclusions. Decoration Tell el-Yehudiyeh Ware is characterised by its distinctive mode of decoration, applied after slipping and burnishing, and created by repeatedly \\"pricking\\" the surface of the vessel with a small sharp object to create a large variety of geometric designs ('puncturing' according to some writers - not a completely accurate description of the process, as it appears to have been the potters' intention not to 'puncture' or 'pierce' the vessel wall, but merely to make a series of small impressions or dents). These designs appear in the form of lines, stripes, triangles, squares and - very occasionally - circles. Vessels of Tell el-Yehudiyeh Ware frequently have a dark surface (the burnished slip varying from brownish black, to grey, to yellowish), the multiple holes often being filled with chalk or lime, the contrasting white material making the surface design even more dramatic. Morphology Tell el-Yahudiyeh Ware juglet. Rockefeller Museum Israel Tell el-Yehudiyeh Ware is primarily seen in the form of juglets, but also includes a large variety of zoomorphic (animal-shaped) vessels and even some shaped like fruit. Distribution Well represented in the Nile Valley up into Nubia (though primarily in the eastern Nile Delta of Egypt), the southern portion of Canaan, the north coast of Canaan, the Phoenician and Syrian coasts and the island of Cyprus (primarily the eastern regions). Not presently found in inland Syria.

He was a native of Parma in the era of the rule of the Farnese family. Biography Giuseppe Leggiadri Gallani, Portrait in family's possession Baptismal records of the Baptistry of Parma indicate that Giuseppe Lizardo (Joseph Lizadrus de Gallanis) was born on December 21 and baptised on December 28, 1516.Baptismal records of the Battistero (Baptistry) of Parma His Godparents included Archbishop Jacobus de Colla, Father Dominicus de Salamonis, Don Franciscus de Bergonzus, Don Cosimeus Taiaferris, Donna Susanna Taiaferris, Donna Jacoba Cozama, Donna Gasparma de Balestris. He was the second child of four born to Ziardo and Susanna. He was the only one baptised with a second Christian name, probably because of the recent death of his Aunt Lizarda, born on February 23, 1490. It is likely that his sister Leggiadra was also named after her aunt (Ziardo's sister). The name 'Lizadrus' italianised as 'Leggiadri' became the second family name with the children of Giuseppe and continues to this day. Other members of Ziardo and Susanna‚Äôs family just used the surname Gallani. Although he studied to become a notary, he never practised, and took up a literary life. Following the assassination in 1547 of the Duke of Parma, Pier Luigi Farnese, his natural successor was his son Ottavio Farnese. When, however, Pope Paul III nominated Orazio Farnese, Duke of Castro, Ottavio's brother, Giuseppe, age 33, who had been loyal to Ottavio, was forced to flee to Naples. In Naples he served various nobles so as to continue his literary activities. In that various 'rime' are published in Venice in 1552 under the title 'Rime di diversi Illustri Signori Napoletani ...... ', could it be that he remained in Naples until this date? This would coincide with the publication of \\"La Guerra di Parma\\" (War of Parma) in 1552 in Parma. His loyalty to Ottavio Farnese found its maximum expression in his poem \\"La Guerra di Parma\\" (War of Parma) Compendio Storico Della Guerra Di Parma, 1548-1553 which he composed shortly after the war in which Ottavio allied with the French and Pope Julius III against the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Ottavio Farnese was, in fact, confirmed as Duke of Parma in 1551. Giuseppe is stated by some to have married Margherita Comina and they had 5 children, two boys, Antonio and Giovanni and 3 girls Margherita Virginia and Lucia. But his will dated April 21, 1567 states he in fact married Hieronyma de Parlasebis. They had one son, Theodoro and it is his son Giuseppe, ie the grandson of Giuseppe the poet, to whom the biographic notes refer.

Biography Early life Born in Akkerman (then in Bessarabia Province of the Russian Empire), Morris Sigman spent his youth working as a lumberjack before moving to London in 1902. In 1903, Sigman emigrated to New York City and began work as a presser in the cloak industry. He organized the Independent Cloak and Skirt Pressers' Union (1904) and allied it with the Socialist Trade and Labor Alliance. In 1905, the Independent Cloak and Skirt Pressers' Union was one of the founding unions of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), but by 1908, the union had left the IWW and joined the ILGWU. Work with the ILGWU Shortly after joining the ILGWU, Morris Sigman began to hold local and national roles within the union. Sigman had been heavily involved in the garment workers' strikes of 1910, and was later arrested for murder in what became known as the \\"Trial of Seven Cloakmakers.\\" With Morris Hillquit as their defense attorney, he and other cloakmakers were found not guilty in 1915. Sigman served as the manager of Local 35 New York Cloak Pressers Union (1913), and then general manager of the Joint Board of Cloakmakers in New York City (1917‚Äì1921). At the international level, Sigman was a vice president of the ILGWU (1910‚Äì1913), before becoming Secretary-Treasurer (1914‚Äì1915) and first vice president (1920‚Äì1923). He was elected president of the ILGWU in 1923. In 1923, the ILGWU president Benjamin Schlesinger resigned and the convention elected Morris Sigman, who had served as the Secretay Treasurer of the ILGWU. Sigman had served as Secretary Treasurer before resigning after a dispute with Schlesinger. As a former IWW member and anti-communist, Sigman immediately began to remove Communist Party members from leadership positions in prominent cities such as Chicago, Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston. Consequently, Sigman was unable to regain control of the New York locals, including Dressmakers‚Äô Local 22, where the Communist Party membership support prevailed.. As a result, the left wing allies, which included many anarchists, and socialists rallied to prevent the ILGWU from physically retaking their union hall. Sigman then proposed an agreement that he later negotiated with the industry in 1925, but the defiant unions led a campaign to reject the proposal. This union-led campaign resulted in more than 30,000 union members gathering at Yankee Stadium to call for a single day work stoppage on August 10, 1925. As the union leadership battled internally, the manufacturers hired gangsters to break the long 1926 general strike on the part of a New York local led by Communist Party members. This ended negotiations with the employers and kept the strike going another four months, at the end of which the union was nearly bankrupt and the left-wing leadership almost fully discredited. Morris Sigman took over negotiations, settled the strike and then proceeded to prevent the Communist Party from obtaining any positions of influence within the ILGWU. Morris Sigman then called for a truce in the internal dispute with the rallied left-wing members. The agreement followed up with a reform of the ILGWU's internal governance system, which gave proportional influence to locals based on the sizes of their memberships, despite the left-wing of the union growing increasingly stronger. With the election at the 1925 convention, Sigman increasingly relied on the support of David Duninsky's cutters union, Italian locals, and many ‚Äòout-of-town‚Äô locals‚Äô to hold on to his presidency. He declared that elections by the membership at this time would be undesirable, although he stated in reply to a question that he had favored the idea in principle at the Philadelphia convention. \\"What the workers of New York want,\\" Sigman claimed, \\"is bread, not referenda. What they want are jobs, not referenda.\\" Sigman also attributed the decreasing union standards in New York to not be from ILGWU officials, but instead a result of general industrial depression complicated by Communists. In addition, Sigman alleged that it was the duty of the New York Joint Board, which his opponents control, to improve conditions, secure the jobs for workers and protect union standards. Sigman announced his intention to be a candidate for re-election, marking the first time in his association with the ILGWU that he had done so. His efforts proved inadequate as the failed 1926 strike had nearly bankrupted the ILGWU, and consequently the International also lost a proportion of the locals that had decided to follow their expelled leaders out of the ILGWU rather than stay within the union. Morris Sigman's preference toward the right-wing within the ILGWU led David Dubinsky to suggest in 1928 that the union bring back Benjamin Schlesinger. In response, Morris Sigman did not support the proposal, but acceded to it and resigned in a dispute with the union's executive board. Benjamin Schlesinger later replaced Morris Sigman and David Dubinsky was named Secretary-Treasurer. Following Schlesinger's death in 1932, Dubinsky succeeded in gaining the presidency. Dubinsky later became the longest serving president of the ILGWU (1932-1966). Dubinsky had previously been a supportive advocate in Sigman's efforts to keep the Communist Party influence out of the union's leadership. Legacy Sigman's tenure as president of the ILGWU was a tempestuous one in which the union faced a long and bitter internal struggle with Communist members for control of the organization. A lengthy strike of New York Cloakmakers in 1926 proved to be another costly battle for the union during this period. But Sigman's term was also marked by some significant accomplishments, including a reform effort that made possible substantial union contributions to the restructuring of the garment industry.

It is one of the most significant outcomes of the 1985 Secretary's Task Force Report on Black and Minority Health, also known as the \\"Heckler Report\\". The Heckler report \\"was a landmark effort in analyzing and synthesizing the present state of knowledge [in 1985] of the major factors that contribute to the health status of Blacks, Hispanics, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans.\\" The Office the Heckler Report established is dedicated to improving the health of racial and ethnic minority populations through the development of health policies and programs that will help eliminate health disparities. OMH was reauthorized by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-148). How OMH works: OMH works in partnership with communities and organizations in the public and private sectors. These collaborations support a systems approach for eliminating health disparities, national planning to identify priorities, and coordinated responses through focused initiatives. OMH provides funding to state offices of minority health, multicultural health, and health equity; community and faith-based organizations, institutions of higher education, tribes and tribal organizations; and other organizations dedicated to improving health. National Partnership for Action to End Health Disparities (NPA) The purpose is to improve nationwide cohesion and coordination of strategies and actions to eliminate health disparities and achieve health equity. The NPA has five goals: increasing awareness; strengthening leadership at all levels; improving health and healthcare outcomes; improving cultural and linguistic competence; and improving data availability, and coordination, utilization, and diffusion of research and evaluation outcomes. OMH Resource Center The OMH Resource Center is a one stop shop for minority health literature, research, and referrals. The center also provides technical assistance to community organizations on HIV/AIDS. Cultural and Linguistic Competency: OMH is committed to culturally and linguistically competent systems that will ensure the needs of minority communities are integrated and addressed within health-related programs across the nation.

It is named after Ronald Fisher. Using the kernel trick, LDA is implicitly performed in a new feature space, which allows non-linear mappings to be learned. Linear discriminant analysis Intuitively, the idea of LDA is to find a projection where class separation is maximized. Given two sets of labeled data, \\\\mathbf{C}_1 and \\\\mathbf{C}_2, define the class means \\\\mathbf{m}_1 and \\\\mathbf{m}_2 as : \\\\mathbf{m}_i = \\\\frac{1}{l_i}\\\\sum_{n=1}^{l_i}\\\\mathbf{x}_n^i, where l_i is the number of examples of class \\\\mathbf{C}_i. The goal of linear discriminant analysis is to give a large separation of the class means while also keeping the in-class variance small. This is formulated as maximizing, with respect to \\\\mathbf{w}, the following ratio: : J(\\\\mathbf{w}) = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{w}^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{S}_B\\\\mathbf{w}}{\\\\mathbf{w}^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{S}_W\\\\mathbf{w}}, where \\\\mathbf{S}_B is the between-class covariance matrix and \\\\mathbf{S}_W is the total within-class covariance matrix: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{S}_B & = (\\\\mathbf{m}_2-\\\\mathbf{m}_1)(\\\\mathbf{m}_2-\\\\mathbf{m}_1)^{\\\\text{T}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{S}_W & = \\\\sum_{i=1,2}\\\\sum_{n=1}^{l_i}(\\\\mathbf{x}_n^i-\\\\mathbf{m}_i)(\\\\mathbf{x}_n^i-\\\\mathbf{m}_i)^{\\\\text{T}}. \\\\end{align} The maximum of the above ratio is attained at : \\\\mathbf{w} \\\\propto \\\\mathbf{S}^{-1}_W(\\\\mathbf{m}_2-\\\\mathbf{m}_1). as can be shown by the Lagrange multiplier method (sketch of proof): Maximizing J(\\\\mathbf{w}) = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{w}^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{S}_B\\\\mathbf{w}}{\\\\mathbf{w}^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{S}_W\\\\mathbf{w}} is equivalent to maximizing : \\\\mathbf{w}^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{S}_B\\\\mathbf{w} subject to : \\\\mathbf{w}^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{S}_W\\\\mathbf{w} = 1 . This, in turn, is equivalent to maximizing I(\\\\mathbf{w}, \\\\lambda) = \\\\mathbf{w}^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{S}_B\\\\mathbf{w} - \\\\lambda (\\\\mathbf{w}^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{S}_W\\\\mathbf{w} - 1) , where \\\\lambda is the Lagrange multiplier. At the maximum, the derivatives of I(\\\\mathbf{w}, \\\\lambda) with respect to \\\\mathbf{w} and \\\\lambda must be zero. Taking \\\\frac{dI}{d\\\\mathbf{w}} = \\\\mathbf{0} yields : \\\\mathbf{S}_B\\\\mathbf{w} - \\\\lambda \\\\mathbf{S}_W \\\\mathbf{w} = \\\\mathbf{0}, which is trivially satisfied by \\\\mathbf{w} = c \\\\mathbf{S}^{-1}_W(\\\\mathbf{m}_2-\\\\mathbf{m}_1) and \\\\lambda = (\\\\mathbf{m}_2-\\\\mathbf{m}_1)^{\\\\text{T}} \\\\mathbf{S}^{-1}_W(\\\\mathbf{m}_2-\\\\mathbf{m}_1). Kernel trick with LDA To extend LDA to non-linear mappings, the data, given as the \\\\ell points \\\\mathbf{x}_i, can be mapped to a new feature space, F, via some function \\\\phi. In this new feature space, the function that needs to be maximized is : J(\\\\mathbf{w}) = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{w}^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{S}_B^{\\\\phi}\\\\mathbf{w}}{\\\\mathbf{w}^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{S}_W^{\\\\phi}\\\\mathbf{w}}, where : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{S}_B^{\\\\phi} & = \\\\left (\\\\mathbf{m}_2^{\\\\phi}-\\\\mathbf{m}_1^{\\\\phi} \\\\right ) \\\\left (\\\\mathbf{m}_2^{\\\\phi}-\\\\mathbf{m}_1^{\\\\phi} \\\\right )^{\\\\text{T}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathbf{S}_W^{\\\\phi} & = \\\\sum_{i=1,2} \\\\sum_{n=1}^{l_i} \\\\left (\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}_n^i)-\\\\mathbf{m}_i^{\\\\phi} \\\\right ) \\\\left (\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}_n^i)-\\\\mathbf{m}_i^{\\\\phi} \\\\right)^{\\\\text{T}}, \\\\end{align} and : \\\\mathbf{m}_i^{\\\\phi} = \\\\frac{1}{l_i}\\\\sum_{j=1}^{l_i}\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}_j^i). Further, note that \\\\mathbf{w}\\\\in F. Explicitly computing the mappings \\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}_i) and then performing LDA can be computationally expensive, and in many cases intractable. For example, F may be infinitely dimensional. Thus, rather than explicitly mapping the data to F, the data can be implicitly embedded by rewriting the algorithm in terms of dot products and using the kernel trick in which the dot product in the new feature space is replaced by a kernel function,k(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{y}) =\\\\phi( \\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\cdot\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{y}). LDA can be reformulated in terms of dot products by first noting that \\\\mathbf{w} will have an expansion of the form : \\\\mathbf{w} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^l\\\\alpha_i\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}_i). Then note that : \\\\mathbf{w}^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{m}_i^{\\\\phi} = \\\\frac{1}{l_i}\\\\sum_{j=1}^{l}\\\\sum_{k=1}^{l_i}\\\\alpha_jk \\\\left (\\\\mathbf{x}_j,\\\\mathbf{x}_k^i \\\\right ) = \\\\mathbf{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{M}_i, where : (\\\\mathbf{M}_i)_j = \\\\frac{1}{l_i}\\\\sum_{k=1}^{l_i}k(\\\\mathbf{x}_j,\\\\mathbf{x}_k^i). The numerator of J(\\\\mathbf{w}) can then be written as: : \\\\mathbf{w}^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{S}_B^{\\\\phi}\\\\mathbf{w} = \\\\mathbf{w}^{\\\\text{T}} \\\\left (\\\\mathbf{m}_2^{\\\\phi}-\\\\mathbf{m}_1^{\\\\phi} \\\\right ) \\\\left (\\\\mathbf{m}_2^{\\\\phi}-\\\\mathbf{m}_1^{\\\\phi} \\\\right )^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{w} = \\\\mathbf{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{M}\\\\mathbf{\\\\alpha}, \\\\qquad \\\\text{where} \\\\qquad \\\\mathbf{M} = (\\\\mathbf{M}_2-\\\\mathbf{M}_1)(\\\\mathbf{M}_2-\\\\mathbf{M}_1)^{\\\\text{T}}. Similarly, the denominator can be written as : \\\\mathbf{w}^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{S}_W^{\\\\phi}\\\\mathbf{w}=\\\\mathbf{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{N}\\\\mathbf{\\\\alpha},\\\\qquad \\\\text{where} \\\\qquad \\\\mathbf{N} = \\\\sum_{j=1,2}\\\\mathbf{K}_j(\\\\mathbf{I}-\\\\mathbf{1}_{l_j})\\\\mathbf{K}_j^{\\\\text{T}}, with the n^{\\\\text{th}}, m^{\\\\text{th}} component of \\\\mathbf{K}_j defined as k(\\\\mathbf{x}_n,\\\\mathbf{x}_m^j), \\\\mathbf{I} is the identity matrix, and \\\\mathbf{1}_{l_j} the matrix with all entries equal to 1/l_j. This identity can be derived by starting out with the expression for \\\\mathbf{w}^{\\\\text{T}} \\\\mathbf{S}_W^{\\\\phi}\\\\mathbf{w} and using the expansion of \\\\mathbf{w} and the definitions of \\\\mathbf{S}_W^{\\\\phi} and \\\\mathbf{m}_i^{\\\\phi} : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{w}^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{S}_W^{\\\\phi}\\\\mathbf{w} &= \\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^l\\\\alpha_i\\\\phi^{\\\\text{T}}(\\\\mathbf{x}_i)\\\\right)\\\\left(\\\\sum_{j=1,2}\\\\sum_{n =1}^{l_j} \\\\left (\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}_n^j)-\\\\mathbf{m}_j^{\\\\phi} \\\\right ) \\\\left (\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}_n^j)-\\\\mathbf{m}_j^{\\\\phi} \\\\right )^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\sum_{k=1}^l\\\\alpha_k\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}_k)\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &= \\\\sum_{j=1,2}\\\\sum_{i=1}^l\\\\sum_{n =1}^{l_j}\\\\sum_{k=1}^l \\\\left (\\\\alpha_i\\\\phi^{\\\\text{T}} (\\\\mathbf{x}_i) \\\\left (\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}_n^j)-\\\\mathbf{m}_j^{\\\\phi} \\\\right ) \\\\left (\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}_n^j)-\\\\mathbf{m}_j^{\\\\phi} \\\\right )^{\\\\text{T}} \\\\alpha_k\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}_k) \\\\right ) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\sum_{j=1,2}\\\\sum_{i=1}^l\\\\sum_{n =1}^{l_j}\\\\sum_{k=1}^l \\\\left(\\\\alpha_ik(\\\\mathbf{x}_i,\\\\mathbf{x}_n^j)-\\\\frac{1}{l_j}\\\\sum_{p=1}^{l_j}\\\\alpha_ik(\\\\mathbf{x}_i,\\\\mathbf{x}_p^j)\\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\alpha_kk(\\\\mathbf{x}_k,\\\\mathbf{x}_n^j)-\\\\frac{1}{l_j}\\\\sum_{q=1}^{l_j}\\\\alpha_kk(\\\\mathbf{x}_k,\\\\mathbf{x}_q^j)\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\sum_{j=1,2}\\\\left( \\\\sum_{i=1}^l\\\\sum_{n =1}^{l_j}\\\\sum_{k=1}^l \\\\left ( \\\\alpha_i\\\\alpha_kk(\\\\mathbf{x}_i,\\\\mathbf{x}_n^j)k(\\\\mathbf{x}_k,\\\\mathbf{x}_n^j) - \\\\frac{2\\\\alpha_i\\\\alpha_k}{l_j}\\\\sum_{p=1}^{l_j}k(\\\\mathbf{x}_i,\\\\mathbf{x}_n^j)k(\\\\mathbf{x}_k,\\\\mathbf{x}_p^j) + \\\\frac{\\\\alpha_i\\\\alpha_k}{l_j^2}\\\\sum_{p=1}^{l_j}\\\\sum_{q=1}^{l_j} k(\\\\mathbf{x}_i,\\\\mathbf{x}_p^j)k(\\\\mathbf{x}_k,\\\\mathbf{x}_q^j) \\\\right) \\\\right )\\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\sum_{j=1,2}\\\\left( \\\\sum_{i=1}^l\\\\sum_{n =1}^{l_j}\\\\sum_{k=1}^l\\\\left( \\\\alpha_i\\\\alpha_kk(\\\\mathbf{x}_i,\\\\mathbf{x}_n^j)k(\\\\mathbf{x}_k,\\\\mathbf{x}_n^j) - \\\\frac{\\\\alpha_i\\\\alpha_k}{l_j}\\\\sum_{p=1}^{l_j}k(\\\\mathbf{x}_i,\\\\mathbf{x}_n^j)k(\\\\mathbf{x}_k,\\\\mathbf{x}_p^j) \\\\right)\\\\right) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & = \\\\sum_{j=1,2} \\\\mathbf{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\text{T}} \\\\mathbf{K}_j\\\\mathbf{K}_j^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{\\\\alpha} - \\\\mathbf{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\text{T}} \\\\mathbf{K}_j\\\\mathbf{1}_{l_j}\\\\mathbf{K}_j^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{\\\\alpha} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[4pt] & = \\\\mathbf{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{N}\\\\mathbf{\\\\alpha}. \\\\end{align} With these equations for the numerator and denominator of J(\\\\mathbf{w}), the equation for J can be rewritten as : J(\\\\mathbf{\\\\alpha}) = \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{M}\\\\mathbf{\\\\alpha}}{\\\\mathbf{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{N}\\\\mathbf{\\\\alpha}}. Then, differentiating and setting equal to zero gives : (\\\\mathbf{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{M}\\\\mathbf{\\\\alpha})\\\\mathbf{N}\\\\mathbf{\\\\alpha} = (\\\\mathbf{\\\\alpha}^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{N}\\\\mathbf{\\\\alpha})\\\\mathbf{M}\\\\mathbf{\\\\alpha}. Since only the direction of \\\\mathbf{w}, and hence the direction of \\\\mathbf{\\\\alpha}, matters, the above can be solved for \\\\mathbf{\\\\alpha} as : \\\\mathbf{\\\\alpha} = \\\\mathbf{N}^{-1}(\\\\mathbf{M}_2- \\\\mathbf{M}_1). Note that in practice, \\\\mathbf{N} is usually singular and so a multiple of the identity is added to it : \\\\mathbf{N}_{\\\\epsilon} = \\\\mathbf{N}+\\\\epsilon\\\\mathbf{I}. Given the solution for \\\\mathbf{\\\\alpha}, the projection of a new data point is given by : y(\\\\mathbf{x}) = (\\\\mathbf{w}\\\\cdot\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x})) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^l\\\\alpha_ik(\\\\mathbf{x}_i,\\\\mathbf{x}). Multi-class KFD The extension to cases where there are more than two classes is relatively straightforward. Let c be the number of classes. Then multi-class KFD involves projecting the data into a (c-1)-dimensional space using (c-1) discriminant functions : y_i = \\\\mathbf{w}_i^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\qquad i= 1,\\\\ldots,c-1. This can be written in matrix notation : \\\\mathbf{y} = \\\\mathbf{W}^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}), where the \\\\mathbf{w}_i are the columns of \\\\mathbf{W}. Further, the between-class covariance matrix is now : \\\\mathbf{S}_B^{\\\\phi} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^c l_i(\\\\mathbf{m}_i^{\\\\phi}-\\\\mathbf{m}^{\\\\phi})(\\\\mathbf{m}_i^{\\\\phi}-\\\\mathbf{m}^{\\\\phi})^{\\\\text{T}}, where \\\\mathbf{m}^\\\\phi is the mean of all the data in the new feature space. The within-class covariance matrix is : \\\\mathbf{S}_W^{\\\\phi} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^c \\\\sum_{n=1}^{l_i}(\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}_n^i)-\\\\mathbf{m}_i^{\\\\phi})(\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}_n^i)-\\\\mathbf{m}_i^{\\\\phi})^{\\\\text{T}}, The solution is now obtained by maximizing : J(\\\\mathbf{W}) = \\\\frac{\\\\left\\\\mathbf{W}^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{S}_B^{\\\\phi}\\\\mathbf{W}\\\\right}{\\\\left\\\\mathbf{W}^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{S}_W^{\\\\phi}\\\\mathbf{W}\\\\right}. The kernel trick can again be used and the goal of multi-class KFD becomes : \\\\mathbf{A}^* = \\\\underset{\\\\mathbf{A}}{\\\\operatorname{argmax}} = \\\\frac{\\\\left\\\\mathbf{A}^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{M}\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\right}{\\\\left\\\\mathbf{A}^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{N}\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\right}, where A = [\\\\mathbf{\\\\alpha}_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\mathbf{\\\\alpha}_{c-1}] and : \\\\begin{align} M & = \\\\sum_{j=1}^cl_j(\\\\mathbf{M}_j-\\\\mathbf{M}_{*})(\\\\mathbf{M}_j-\\\\mathbf{M}_{*})^{\\\\text{T}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ N & = \\\\sum_{j=1}^c\\\\mathbf{K}_j(\\\\mathbf{I}-\\\\mathbf{1}_{l_j})\\\\mathbf{K}_j^{\\\\text{T}}. \\\\end{align} The \\\\mathbf{M}_i are defined as in the above section and \\\\mathbf{M}_{*} is defined as : (\\\\mathbf{M}_{*})_j = \\\\frac{1}{l}\\\\sum_{k=1}^{l}k(\\\\mathbf{x}_j,\\\\mathbf{x}_k). \\\\mathbf{A}^{*} can then be computed by finding the (c-1) leading eigenvectors of \\\\mathbf{N}^{-1}\\\\mathbf{M}. Furthermore, the projection of a new input, \\\\mathbf{x}_t, is given by : \\\\mathbf{y}(\\\\mathbf{x}_t) = \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{A}^{*}\\\\right)^{\\\\text{T}}\\\\mathbf{K}_t, where the i^{th} component of \\\\mathbf{K}_t is given by k(\\\\mathbf{x}_i,\\\\mathbf{x}_t). Classification using KFD In both two-class and multi-class KFD, the class label of a new input can be assigned as : f(\\\\mathbf{x}) = arg\\\\min_j D(\\\\mathbf{y}(\\\\mathbf{x}),\\\\bar{\\\\mathbf{y}}_j), where \\\\bar{\\\\mathbf{y}}_j is the projected mean for class j and D(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot) is a distance function.

Biziou served in the 6th (Service) Battalion, Yorkshire Regiment at Gallipoli, Egypt and France. He was still with the regiment when, on 31 May 1916, he was posted to the army's General List as a temporary second lieutenant to meet wartime needs. Biziou began duty as an aerial observer, probably with No. 42 Squadron, on 6 October 1916, and was transferred to the Royal Flying Corps General List on 23 November 1916. On 1 April 1917, he was promoted to temporary lieutenant. Biziou then trained as a pilot, including the course at the School of Special Flying at Gosport. He was then posted to No. 87 Squadron and landed in France in April 1918. He flew a Sopwith Dolphin, and scored the squadron's first victory on 6 May. Over time, he ran off a tally of two reconnaissance planes and five fighters destroyed, and another fighter driven down out of control by 22 September.Shores et.al. (1990), p.78-79.

He served as the press officer for General Francisco Franco and General Emilio Mola. He inherited the title of El XI (English: The 11th Count of Alba de Yeltes) in 1919. Gonzalo de Aguilera Munro was born in Madrid on December 26, 1886, the son of Lieutenant Colonel Agust√≠n Aguilera y Gamboa, 10th Conde de Alba de Yeltes, an officer in the Spanish Cavalry. His mother, Mary Monro, was Scottish. He was educated in England, first at Wimbledon College and then at Stonyhurst College, a Jesuit public school in Lancashire where his father had been a pupil. It is alleged that Gonzalo, 11th Conde de Alba de Yeltes, carried out many atrocities during the Spanish Civil War. At the outbreak of the war, according to his own account, the Conde de Alba de Yeltes lined up the labourers on his estate and shot six of them as a lesson to the others. Reported in As the press officer of the nationalist faction during the Spanish Civil War, de Alba de Yeltes worked with war correspondents covering the war, including Sefton Delmer, Arnold Lunn and Hubert Renfro Knickerbocker. As he got older, the Conde seemed to suffer increasingly from mental instability. On Friday, 26 August 1964, he shot dead both his adult sons in the family mansion near Salamanca. He was subsequently incarcerated in an asylum in Salamanca, where he died the following year, having never stood trial for killing his sons.

These twenty- three battalions represent two Air Defense Artillery, four Field Artillery and seven Infantry regiments. Three additional Air Defense Artillery regiments have been awarded shared credit for War of 1812 campaigns, but the lineages of the artillery companies that earned those credits have not been perpetuated by currently active battalions. There are also twenty-four Army National Guard units with campaign credit for the War of 1812. Air Defense Artillery When the War of 1812 began, the Regular Army contained four regiments of artillery: the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Regiments of Artillery, and the Regiment of Light Artillery. In March 1814 the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Regiments were combined to form the Corps of Artillery, consisting of forty-eight companies; the Regiment of Light Artillery consisted of ten companies.McKenney 2007, p. 26. Only a few companies from the 1st and 2nd Regiments of Artillery functioned regularly as \\"mobile\\" artillery, that is, in support of an infantry attack. Most of the time during the War of 1812 artillery was used as \\"position\\" artillery to repel an attack by enemy infantry. Artillery companies also often fought as infantry. Indeed, the 1st Regiment of Artillery served primarily as infantry in New York and along the Canada‚ÄìUS border, and the Regiment of Light Artillery, rather than functioning as a mobile horse artillery, was reorganized as infantry by the end of the war.McKenney 2007, p. 27. During a major reorganization of the Army in 1821, the Corps of Artillery and the Regiment of Light Artillery were abolished, and four new artillery regiments were constituted: the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Regiments of Artillery. These four regiments were the precursors of the present-day 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Air Defense Artillery Regiments. The four new regiments constituted in 1821 were organized from existing artillery companies that had served in the War of 1812. As a consequence, even though these four Air Defense Artillery Regiments do not trace their lineages back to artillery formations that existed during the War of 1812, all four have been awarded shared credit for War of 1812 campaigns because of the service of their component elements that do date back to the War of 1812 or earlier.McKenney 2007, p. 32. Of the fourteen companies that survived into the twenty-first century as Air Defense Artillery battalions, only two are currently active: 2-1 ADA and 3-4 ADA. 1st Air Defense Artillery Campaigns: Canada Distinctive Unit Insignia: 1 ADA The 1st Air Defense Artillery traces its lineage back to June 1, 1821, when the 1st Regiment of Artillery was organized at Fort Independence, Massachusetts, from existing companies dating back to the War of 1812 or earlier.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 1st Air Defense Artillery.(http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/ada/0001ada.htm) Three of the companies used to form the new 1st Regiment of Artillery in 1821 were artillery companies that served along the Canada‚ÄìUS border during the War of 1812: Captain Ichabod B. Crane's Company, 3rd Regiment of Artillery; Captain Robert G. Hite's Company, 3rd Regiment of Artillery, constituted on January 11, 1812;McKenney 1985, pp. 18‚Äì19. and Captain Francis Stribling's Company of Light Artillery, organized in 1814McKenney 1985, pp. 20‚Äì21 Cranes' Company is the antecedent of today's 2-1 ADA; Hite's Company, of 6-1 ADA; and Stribling's Company, of 7-1 ADA. Only one of these battalions is currently active: 2-1 ADA. =2-1 ADA= Campaigns (earned): Canada 2-1 ADA traces its lineage to Captain Ichabod Crane's Company, 3rd Regiment of Artillery, constituted January 11, 1812, and organized in July, 1812. Crane's Company was redesignated May 12, 1814, as Captain Ichabod Crane's Company, Corps of Artillery.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 2nd Battalion, 1st Air Defense Artillery.(http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/ada/0001ada02bn.htm) During the War of 1812 Crane's Company, along with several other companies from the 3rd Regiment of Artillery, moved from its cantonment in New York to Sackett's Harbor for service along the Niagara Frontier. These companies, fighting as infantry, participated in the capture of York (west of present-day Toronto) and Fort George (located in Canada at the mouth of the Niagara River).Fredriksen 2009, p. 168. 2-1 ADA is a Patriot battalion serving as an element of the 35th Air Defense Artillery Brigade, stationed at Camp Carroll, South Korea. 2nd Air Defense Artillery Campaigns: Canada Distinctive Unit Insignia: 1 ADA The 2nd Air Defense Artillery traces it lineage back to June 1, 1821, when the 2nd Regiment of Artillery was organized at Baltimore, Maryland, from existing companies, a number of which dated back to the War of 1812 or earlier.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 2nd Air Defense Artillery (http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/ada/0002ada.htm) Three battalions of the 2nd Air Defense Artillery are derived from artillery companies that saw action along the Canada‚ÄìUS border: Brevet Lieutenant Colonel Nathan Towson's Company, 2nd Regiment of Artillery, constituted on January 11, 1812;McKenney 1985, pp. 36‚Äì38; a company in the 1st Regiment of Artillery commanded by Captain Lloyd Beal, Captain Samuel T. Dyson, 3rd Lieutenant Moses M. Russell and Captain Frederick Evans in the 1st Regiment of Artillery, originally organized in 1810 as Captain Lloyd Beal's Company;McKenney 1985, pp.40‚Äì41 and a company in the 3rd Regiment of Artillery commanded by Captain Thomas Stockton and Captain Benjamin Pierce, constituted on January 11, 1812, as Captain Thomas Stockton's Company.Mckenney 1985, pp. 45‚Äì46 Towson's Company was the precursor of today's 2-2 ADA; Beal's/Dyson's/Russel's/Evans' Company, of the 4th Howitzer Battalion, 2 ADA; and Stockton's/Pierce's Company, of the 6th Missile Battalion, 2 ADA. None of these battalions is currently active. Lieutenant Colonel Towson emerged as one of the most competent artillery officers in the American Army. His company distinguished itself at the Battles of Chippewa and Lundy's Lane. Credit for these two campaigns is not shared with the 2nd Air Defense Artillery Regiment, since shared credit is awarded only when at least two subordinate elements of the regiment have earned that credit. 3rd Air Defense Artillery Campaigns: Canada Distinctive Unit Insignia: 3 ADA The 3rd Air Defense Artillery was constituted on June 1, 1821, as the 3rd Regiment of Artillery and organized from existing units with headquarters at Fort Washington, Maryland.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 3rd Air Defense Artillery (http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/ada/0003ada.htm) Two of the companies used to form the new 3rd Regiment of Artillery in 1821 were artillery companies that had earned credit for the Canada Campaign through service along the Canada‚ÄìUS border: Captain Addison B. Armistead's Company, 2nd Regiment of Artillery, originally constituted in 1798 as Captain John Lillie's Company, 2nd Regiment of Artillerists and Engineers, which, after several redesignations became Captain Addison Armistead's Company, 2nd Regiment of Artillery on January 11, 1812;McKenney 1985, pp. 55‚Äì57 and Captain A. C. W. Fanning's Company, 3rd Regiment of Artillery, constituted on January 11, 1812, as a company in the 3rd Regiment of Artillery and organized in Sacketts Harbor, New York, in July, 1812, and redesignated as Captain Fanning's Company, Corps of Artillery in May, 1814.McKenney 1985, pp. 58‚Äì60 Fanning's Company played an important role in the defense of Fort Erie during Major General Jacob Brown's invasion of the Niagara Peninsula in 1814. Armistead's Company was the precursor of the 1-3 ADA; Fanning's Company, of the 2-3 ADA. Neither 1-3 ADA nor 2-3 ADA is currently active. 4th Air Defense Artillery Campaigns: Louisiana 1815 Distinctive Unit Insignia: 4 ADA The 4th Air Defense Artillery traces its lineage back to June 1, 1821, when 4th Regiment of Artillery was constituted in the Regular Army and organized from existing units with headquarters at Pensacola, Florida.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 4th Air Defense Artillery (http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/ada/0004ada.htm) Two battalions of the 4th Air Defense Artillery are derived from artillery companies that served in the War of 1812: Captain Thomas Murray's Company, 1st Regiment of Artillery, originally constituted on October 20, 1786, and organized at West Point, New York, as Captain Henry Burbeck's Company of Artillery;Mckenney 1985, pp.81‚Äì83. and Captain James Barker's Company, 2nd Regiment of Artillery, constituted on January 11, 1812.McKenney 1985, pp. 87‚Äì89 Murray's Company and Barker's Company are the antecedent of today's 1-4 and 3-4 ADA, respectively. Only one of these battalions is currently active: 3-4 ADA. The credit for the Louisiana (1815) Campaign awarded to the 4th Air Defense Artillery is shared credit earned by Captain Thomas Murray's Company, which was at Fort St. Philip, a fort below New Orleans about thirty miles from the mouth of the Mississippi River, when it was subjected to a prolonged bombardment by British warships on January 5, 1815,Remini 1999, p. 170. and Captain Charles Wollstonecraft's Companies. Wollstonecraft's Company is the predecessor of a battalion that is no longer in the 4th Air Defense Artillery. Wollstonecraft's Company ultimately became today's 1-5 FA, the oldest unit in the Regular Army. Its lineage and participation in the War of 1812 will be discussed in the section on the 5th Field Artillery. The fact that a regiment can retain the battle honors earned by a subordinate unit that no longer serves in the regiment is due to a quirk in the rules for assigning campaign credits prior to 1898 that applied before the implementation of the Combat Arms Regimental System in 1957. The passage and display of regimental honors was governed by AR 870-5, which states that campaign participation credit that accrues to a color-bearing organization includes \\"credit earned by two or more of its guidon-bearing elements before 1898.\\" Thus, the credit earned by Murray's and Wollstonecraft's Companies passed to the 4th Air Defense Artillery as a shared honor for all of its elements. AR 870-5 also states that \\"the honors of a color-bearing organization will not be changed by the removal of its organic elements.\\" Therefore, the shared credit remains with the 4th Air Defense Artillery, even though one of the units that earned that credit has been removed from the regiment. =3-4 ADA= Campaigns (earned): Canada 3-4 ADA traces its history back to a company in the 2nd Regiment of Artillery constituted on January 11, 1812, and organized in May as Captain James N. Barker's Company, 2nd Regiment of Artillery. Barker's Company was consolidated in late 1813 with Captain Spotswood Henry's Company, 2nd Regiment of Artillery (organized in 1812), with the consolidated unit designated as Capt. James. N. Barker's Company, 2nd Regiment of Artillery. In December 1813, Barker's Company was redesignated as Captain Samuel B. Archer's Company, 2nd Regiment of Artillery, and then as Captain Samuel B. Archer's Company, Corps of Artillery, on May 17, 1814.Mckenney 1985, pp.87‚Äì89. Barker's Company participated in a number of actions along the Canadian‚ÄìAmerican border, including Queenston Heights (October 13, 1812), Fort George (May 27, 1813) and Stoney Creek (June 6, 1813).Fredricksen 2009, p163‚Äì165. Since 3-4 ADA is the only battalion in the 4th Air Defense Artillery with credit for the Canada campaign, this credit is not shared with the regiment. 3-4 ADA is an air and missile defense battalion serving as an element of the 108th ADA Brigade, 32nd Army Air and Missile Defense Command, currently stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. 61st Air Defense Artillery Campaigns: None Distinctive Unit Insignia: 61 ADA The 61st Air Defense Artillery traces its lineage to the 61st Artillery (Coast Artillery Corps), constituted on March 9, 1918, and organized at Fort Moultrie, South Carolina, from existing Regular Army and National Guard Companies from Georgia and South Carolina.McKenney 1885, pp. 297‚Äì299. The 61st Air Defense Artillery include a single battalion that is derived from a company that served in the War of 1812: 1-61 ADA. 1-61 ADA traces its history back to Captain Nathan Estabrook's Company of Light Artillery constituted in 1808. On March 1, 1811, Captain Nathan Estabrook's Company of Light Artillery was redesignated as Captain Robert H. MacPherson's Company of Light Artillery, which became Captain Luther Leonard's Company of Light Artillery in 1812.McKenney 1885, pp. 300‚Äì301. Leonard's Company earned credit for the Canada Campaign as a consequence of its involvement in a number of actions along the Canada‚ÄìUS border, including the bombardment of Fort George and Smyth's failed attempt to cross the Niagara River to invade Canada.Fredriksen 2009, p. 176. 61 ADA cannot be awarded shared credit for the Canada Campaign, since 1-61 ADA is the only battalion in the regiment with that credit. 62nd Air Defense Artillery Campaigns: Streamer without inscription Distinctive Unit Insignia: 62 ADA The 62nd Air Defense Artillery traces its lineage back to the 2nd Antiaircraft Artillery Battalion constituted on August 1, 1921, and organized from existing units at Fort Totten, New Jersey.McKenney 1885, pp. 317‚Äì319. Three battalions of the 62nd Air Defense Artillery are derived from artillery companies that served in the War of 1812: 1-62 ADA, derived from Captain James Hanham's Company, 1st Regiment of Artillery, originally constituted on April 27, 1798, and organized near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as Captain Callender Irvings's Company;McKenney 1985, pp. 320‚Äì322. 2-62 ADA, derived from a company in the Regiment of Light Artillery, first commanded by Captain James Gibson and later by Captain Arthur W. Thornton, initially organized on April 12, 1808, as Captain George Peters Company of Light Artillery constituted on April 12, 1808;McKenney 1985, pp323‚Äì324. and 3-62 ADA, descended from Captain John Goddall's Company, 2nd Regiment of Artillery, derived from a detachment of the 2nd Regiment of Artillery, organized in 1812 at Fort Independence, Massachusetts, under the command of 2nd Lieutenant William Smith. None of these battalions are currently active. The Streamer without inscription is shared credit earned by 1-61 ADA and 3-61 ADA. 2-62 ADA earned credit for the Canada Campaign,Fredricksen 2009, pp.176‚Äì176. but this credit is not shared with the regiment. The six segments of the Distinctive Unit Insignia commemorate service in six wars of America's wars by subordinate units of the regiment, one of those wars being the War of 1812.Stein 1993, p. 33. Field Artillery Following the War of 1812 a few artillery companies continued to serve with infantry units on the frontier, but the vast majority were redeployed to permanent defensive fortifications along the coast that had been built to defend port cities. None of these post-war units were equipped to function as \\"mobile\\" artillery. However, in France and Great Britain there was both a growing recognition of the potential value of field artillery and significant technological progress that made the development and use of light artillery feasible. Although the United States trailed the European powers in the creation of artillery units designed to function in the field with infantry and cavalry, ten of the forty-eight Regular Army Artillery companies that fought in the Mexican War were field artillery. And they performed very well indeed. By the time of the Civil War, the vast majority of the artillery on both sides was field artillery. Between the end of the Civil War and the beginning of the twentieth century, the missions of \\"mobile\\" and \\"position\\" artillery continued to diverge, and finally in 1901 the existing artillery companies that constituted the Corps of Artillery were redesignated as either batteries of field artillery or companies of coast artillery. And then in 1907 Congress passed an act that created two separate branches of artillery: Field Artillery and Coast Artillery. Organizational change continue during the twentieth century as the military adjusted to the role of airplanes and missiles in warfare, leading eventually to the transformation of the Coast Artillery into the Air Defense Artillery.McKenney 2007, pp. 17‚Äì124. Of the six artillery companies from the War of 1812 that survived into the twenty-first century as battalions in Field Artillery Regiments, four are currently active: 4-1 FA, 5-3 FA, 1-5 FA and 1-6 FA. 1st Field Artillery Campaigns: None Distinctive Unit Insignia: 1 FA The 1st Field Artillery was constituted on January 25, 1907, and organized from new and existing units at Fort Riley, Kansas.McKenney 2010, pp.240‚Äì241. Two battalions of the 1st Field Artillery are derived from artillery companies that served in the War of 1812: 4-1 FA, derived from Captain Nathaniel Leonard's Company, 1st Regiment of Artillery; and 5-1 FA, derived from Captain Benjamin Ogden's Company, 3rd Regiment of Artillery, constituted on January 11, 1812.McKenney 2010, pp. 250‚Äì251 Only one of these two battalions is currently active: 4-1 FA. The maple leaf in the Distinctive Unit Insignia of the 1st Field Artillery commemorates the service in Canada of some elements of the regiment during the War of 1812.Stein 1993, p.36. =4-1 FA= Campaigns (earned): Canada 4-1 FA originated as Captain Moses Porter's Company of Artillery of the 3rd Sublegion, Legion of the United States, organized in 1792 near Fort Wayne, Indiana. By 1804 Captain Porter's Company had become Captain Nathaniel Leonard's Company, Regiment of Artillerists, which was redesignated on January 11, 1812, as Captain Nathaniel Leonard's Company, 1st Regiment of Artillery. In early 1814 Captain Leonard's Company was consolidated with Captain Alexander S. Brooks's Company, 3rd Regiment of Artillery (constituted on January 11, 1812, as Captain James McKeon's Company, 3rd Regiment of Artillery), with the new company redesignated as Captain Alexander Brooks's Company, 3rd Regiment of Artillery. On May 12, 1814, Captain Brooks's Company was redesignated as Captain Alexander Brooks's Company, Corps of Artillery. Credit for the Canada Campaign for 4-1 FA was earned by participation of Leonard's and Brook's Company in several actions along the Canada‚ÄìUS border. In its first action Leonard's Company, among the American force at Fort Niagara, was credited with sinking a British schooner at its wharf on the other side of the Niagara River while firing on Fort George on November 21‚Äì22. Leonard's Company was still at Fort Niagara a year later when the British captured the fort. Negligent leadership by Captain. Leonard, who commanded the fort at the time, is generally blamed for the relatively easy victory by the British.Fredricksen 2009, pp. 161‚Äì162. The company, under the command of Captain Alexander Brooks, was present at the Battle of Plattsburg, the American victory that ended the final British attempt to invade the northeastern states along the Richelieu River and Lake Champlain.Fredricksen 2009, p. 171. 4-1 FA is currently an element in the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Armored Division. 3rd Field Artillery Campaigns: Canada Distinctive Unit Insignia: 3 FA The 3rd Field Artillery traces its lineage back to January 5, 1907, when the 3rd Field Artillery was organized at Fort Sam Houston, Texas, from new and existing companies. Two battalions of the 3rd Field Artillery are derived from artillery companies that served in the War of 1812: 1-3 FA, derived from Captain Samuel Dyson's Company, 1st Regiment of Artillery, originally constituted on May 9, 1794, and organized on June 30, 1794, at Governor's Island, New York, as Captain Alexander Thompson's Company, which became Captain Dyson's Company, Regiment of Artillerists in 1804;Mckenney 2010, pp. 277‚Äì279. and 5-3 FA, derived from Captain Nehemiah Freeman's Company, 1st Regiment of Artillery, originally constituted on April 27, 1798, and organized in June 1798 at Alexandria, Virginia, as Captain William McRae's Company, 2nd Regiment of Artillerists and Engineers. Both 1-3 FA and 5-3 FA have credit for the Canada Campaign. Only one is currently active: 5-3 FA. During the early phases of the war, Dyson's Company, or elements thereof, participated in Brigadier General William Hull's unsuccessful invasion of Canada and his subsequent retreat and surrender of Detroit.Gilpin 1958, pp. 76, 92‚Äì93, 114‚Äì116. The lion's face in the Distinctive Unit Insignia alludes to the participation of some of the elements of the regiment in the War of 1812.Stein 1993, p. 37. =5-3 FA= Campaigns (earned):Canada 5-3 FA was constituted on April 27, 1798, and organized in June 1798 at Alexandria, Virginia, as Captain William McRae's Company, 2nd Regiment of Artillerists and Engineers. By 1800, Captain McRae's Company had become Captain Alexander D. Pope's Company, 4th Battalion, 2nd Regiment of Artillerists and Engineers, which was consolidated on April 1, 1802, with Captain Josiah Dunham's and Captain John Henry's Companies (both constituted April 27, 1798), with the new unit being redesignated as Captain Nehemiah Freeman's Company, Regiment of Artillerists. Captain Freeman's Company was redesignated as Captain Nehemiah Freeman's Company, 1st Regiment of Artillery on January 11, 1812, which was redesignated as Captain William Gates' Company, 1st Regiment of Artillery on August 16, 1813. Captain William Gates' Company, 1st Regiment of Artillery, was redesignated as Captain William Gates' Company, Corps of Artillery, on May 12, 1814.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 5th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery.(http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/fa/0003fa05bn.htm) Credit for the Canada Campaign was awarded to the 5-3 FA for service by Freeman's and Gates' Company in forts and garrisons along the Canada‚ÄìUS border. 5-3 FA is currently assigned to the 17th Fires Brigade, I Corps. 5th Field Artillery Campaigns: None Distinctive Unit Insignia: 5 FA The 5th Field Artillery traces its lineage back to January 25, 1907, when the 5th Field Artillery was organized at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, from new and existing companies (less the 2nd Battalion, which was organized in the Philippine Islands).Mckenney 2010, pp. 308‚Äì310. One battalion of the 5th Field Artillery, 1-5 FA, is derived from Captain Charles Wollstonecraft's Company. Wollstonecraft's Company earned credit for the Louisiana 1815 Campaign. This credit is not shared by the 5th Field Artillery Regiment, since 1-5 FA is the only battalion in the regiment with earned credit for this campaign. =1-5 FA= Campaigns (earned): Louisiana 1814, Louisiana 1815 1-5 FA is the oldest unit in the Regular Army and the only one to have credit for participation in the Revolutionary War. The battalion traces its roots to the New York Provincial Company of Artillery, organized in 1776 and initially commanded by Captain Alexander Hamilton. From 1777 through 1784 it was referred to as Captain John Doughty's Company. After many reorganizations and redesignations, the unit became Captain John Wollstonecraft's Company, 1st Regiment of Artillery on January 11, 1812. In May 1813 Wollstonecraft's Company was redesignated as a company in the Corps of Artillery when this organization was formed by combining the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Regiments of Artillery.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 1st Battalion, 5th Field Artillery.(http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/fa/0005fa01bn.htm). Wollstonecraft's Company, along with Captain Thomas Murray's Company (refer to the section on the 4th Air Defense Artillery), was among the forces at Fort St. Philip, a fort below New Orleans about thirty miles from the mouth of the Mississippi River, that was subjected to a prolonged bombarded by British warships on January 9‚Äì18, 1815, following the unsuccessful British assault on New Orleans.Fredriksen 2009, pp. 172‚Äì173. This action earned credit for the Louisiana 1815 Campaign. 1-5 FA is currently active, serving as an element of the 1st Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division. 6th Field Artillery Campaigns: None Distinctive Unit Insignia: 6 FA Right The 6th Field Artillery was constituted on January 25, 1907, and organized from existing units at Fort Riley, Kansas.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 5th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery.(http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/fa/0006fa.htm). One battalion of the 6th Field Artillery, 1-6 FA, is derived from an artillery company that served in the War of 1812: Capt. Enoch Humphrey's Company. =1-6 FA= Campaigns (earned): New Orleans 1-6 FA traces its lineage back to Captain James Stille's Company, 3rd Battalion, 2nd Regiment of Artillerists and Engineers, constituted on April 27, 1798, and organized in 1798 at Fort Jay, New York. By 1809 Captain Stille's Company had become Captain. Enoch Humphrey's Company, Regiment of Artillerists, which was redesignated as Captain Enoch Humphrey's Company, 1st Regiment of Artillery, on January 11, 1812, and then as Captain Enoch Humphrey's Company, Corps of Artillery, on May 12, 1814.Department of the Army, Lineage and Honors, 5th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery.(http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/fa/0006fa01bn.htm). Humphrey's Company played a crucial role in the Battle of New Orleans during the climactic British assault on January 8, 1815. Humphrey's Company was positioned about seventy feet from the Mississippi River at the right terminus of Jackson's primary defense line east of the river.Mahon 1972, p. 362. The devastating fire that the American artillery put down on the advancing British infantry played a decisive role in stopping the British attack. 1-6 FA is currently active, serving as an element of the 3rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division. Infantry During the demobilization that occurred immediately following the war, thirteen infantry regiments were abolished, while eight new infantry regiments, numbered 1 through 8, were formed by consolidating various combinations of thirty-five of the forty-eight regiments that had existed during the war, as follows: :::1st Infantry formed by consolidation of the 2nd, 3rd, 7th and 44th Infantry Regiments; :::2nd Infantry formed by consolidation of the 6th, 16th, 22nd, 23rd and 32nd Infantry Regiments; :::3rd Infantry formed by consolidation of the 1st, 5th, 17th, 19th and 28th Infantry Regiments; :::4th Infantry formed by consolidation of the 14th, 18th, 20th, 36th and 38th Infantry Regiments; :::5th Infantry formed by consolidation of the 4th, 9th, 13th, 21st, 40th and 46th Infantry Regiments; :::6th Infantry formed by consolidation of the 11th, 25th, 27th, 29th and 37th Infantry Regiments; :::7th Infantry formed by consolidation of the 8th, 24th and 39th Infantry Regiments; and :::8th Infantry formed by consolidation of the 10th and 12th Infantry Regiments. The new 8th Infantry was abolished soon after its formation. The new regiments numbered 1 through 7 resulting from these consolidations still exist, and they perpetuate the lineages of thirty-three regiments that served during the War of 1812. These seven regiments are the only current infantry regiments with credit for participation in the War of 1812. It was not until 1838, in anticipation of the War with Mexico, that additional regiments were created.Mahon & Danysh 1972, pp. 11‚Äì16. Note that the numbering of the seven new infantry regiments formed during this contraction of the Army did not correspond to the numbering of the seven infantry regiments that existed before the contraction. The numerical designations of the new regiments were determined by the seniority of the commanding officers, i.e., the regiment with the most senior commanding officer was designated as the 1st Infantry, while the regiment with the next most senior colonel became the 2nd Infantry, and so on. This reorganization caused considerable consternation among many in the Army, who considered it an attack on regimental traditions. At the core of this dispute was whether the seven new regiments shared a heritage with the older regiments with the same numerical designation (the veterans of the War of 1812 felt strongly that they did), or whether a regiment's heritage followed its organizational history no matter what changes in numerical designation might have occurred (the official War Department policy). This contradiction between sentiment and logic went unresolved, and was largely ignored, for the next fifty years, during which time the soldiers in the seven infantry regiments continued to claim a shared heritage with the earlier units with the same number, while the official policy was that heritage was defined entirely by organizational history. A resolution of this smoldering conflict was forced upon the Army in the aftermath of the Civil War, when it became official policy that regiments would display their battle histories on their colors or in the form of streamers representing participation in specific battles or campaigns. Infantry regiments numbering 1‚Äì7, in direct violation of War Department policy, proudly claimed credit for campaigns earned by the older regiments with the same numerical designation. Finally, in 1896, the War Department yielded to sentiment and ordered that the new regiments formed in 1815 could claim credit for campaigns awarded to earlier regiments with the same number. But the last word had not yet been spoken, and during the 1920s there was a series of reversals of policy and reversals of reversals. In 1920 the War Department reversed the 1896 policy, issuing a ruling that forbade existing regiments from claiming credit for campaigns earned by earlier units on the basis numerical designation and denying any historical linkage between units based upon numerical designation. Needless to say, this announcement caused great anguish among the soldiers in the regiments. The official edict is reproduced below in full. :::II. Rules for tracing history of units (Cir. No. 80, W. D., 1920). ‚Äì It has come to the attention of the War Department that there is some divergence of understanding in regard to the method of tracing the history of troop units. To settle the practice, the following rule is announced for the guidance of all concerned: The numerical designation of a troop unit does not in itself entitle that unit to inherit the history of any previous unit having that number; the organization itself will be traced through its changes, regardless of number.Marsh 1920, p. 2. But in 1923 the War Department issued a new policy that totally reversed the policy of 1920. According to this announcement, not only would the regiments formed in 1815 be allowed to claim campaign credits earned by the earlier units with the same number, but it also asserted that historical continuity between units could be claimed solely on the basis of identical numerical designations. :::IV. History of certain regiments. ‚Äì In the application of the principles stated in Section II, Bulletin No. 13, War Department, 1920 (Rules for tracing history of units), the records of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th Regiments of Infantry up to and including the reorganization of the Army in 1815 substantially as approved by the Secretary of War, October 30, 1896, and published in the Army Register from 1897 to 1912, will not be disturbed. The history of those seven regiments prior to 1816 will be credited in accordance with similarity of numerical designations, and will not be considered to have passed to another regiment because of the \\"muster for selection\\" incident to the reorganization of 1815; however, battle honors that may have been awarded to any one of the first seven regiments of Infantry because of the reorganization in 1815 will not have to be withdrawn.Pershing 1923, p.1. In 1926, the 1923 policy was rescinded, and yet a new revised set of rules for determining both the lineage and the honors for the current 1st-through-7th Infantry Regiments was established. This policy was a compromise, and in common with so many compromises it really isn't logically consistent but has the virtue of satisfying both parties in the dispute. According to this edict, lineages were to be determined strictly according to accepted genealogical principles: lineages would follow organizational changes and redesignations, regardless of numerical designations. But the current 1st through 7th Infantry Regiments would be allowed to claim battle honors earned by the earlier infantry regiments having the same number: the powerful feelings of members of the new regiments of a shared heritage with their counterparts in older regiments with the same number were recognized and officially enshrined. :::I. History of certain regiments. ‚Äì Section IV, Bulletin No. 8, War Department, 1923, relating to the foregoing subject is rescinded; but battle honors that may have been awarded to any of the first seven regiments of Infantry in compliance with the provisions thereof will not be now withdrawn.Summerall 1929, p. 1. An interesting reflection of this dispute will be described in more detail in the discussion of the Distinctive Unit Insignia of the 7th Infantry Regiment, in which the DUI commemorates events in the histories of the old 7th Infantry Regiment, which is not in the lineages of the current 7th Infantry. 1st Infantry Campaigns: Canada, Lundy's Lane, New Orleans, Alabama 1814, Florida 1814, Alabama 1815, Louisiana 1815 Distinctive Unit Insignia: 1 Inf The 1st Infantry was constituted on March 3, 1791, as the 2nd Infantry and organized in New England.

The Distinctive Unit Insignia of the 7th Infantry, which consists of a cotton bale superimposed on two crossed bayonets, commemorates the role of the old 7th Infantry in the American victory at the Battle of New Orleans. The symbolism of the cotton bale derives from the fact that cotton bales, covered with mud, were sometimes incorporated into the defensive works behind which soldiers were positioned. But the old 7th Infantry is not in the lineage of the current 7th Infantry. In fact, none of the infantry regiments that were combined in 1815 to form the new 7th Infantry served at New Orleans. The old 7th Infantry is in the lineage of the current 1st Infantry. Indeed, the actions of the old 7th Infantry are noted in the section on the 1st Infantry above. The combined effects of the War Department Bulletins of June 11, 1923, and September 30, 1929, was to affirm that both the current 1st and 7th Infantry Regiments are entitled to claim credit for the campaigns earned by the old 7th Infantry during the War of 1812.

Biography Alma Margaret Mathers, born in Manawatu, grew up in Mangakino, a small township founded to serve a hydro-electric power station in the North Island of New Zealand. Her earliest experience of theatre was being taken, as a high school student, to a New Zealand Players production of Saint Joan, which starred Edith Campion, mother of Jane Campion, as Saint Joan. This, along with a tiny local library which contained works by Shaw and Wilde, began her interest in theatre. In 1964 she moved to Australia and through the artist Geoffrey De Groen, whom she married in 1965, Alma De Groen was introduced to the film maker Sandy Harbutt, who read her first play, The Sweatproof Boy. Harbutt persuaded theatre director Brian Syron to read it and a mentorship lasting many years began. Syron was the first Aboriginal Australian to study at RADA and at the legendary Stella Adler Studio in New York. His letters of advice and encouragement, and the opportunity to stay with him in New York, where he took her to see Off-Broadway theatre, were critical to her development as a playwright. (Elizabeth Perkins pg 5) Career Her career began in earnest when she was living in Canada with husband Geoffrey, and daughter, Nadine. The Nimrod Theatre in Sydney performed The Sweatproof Boy in 1972, directed by Richard Wherrett, who directed most of her early work. The APG (Australian Performing Group) produced her second play, The Joss Adams Show at The Pram Factory in Melbourne, also in 1972. This play, along with the group-devised Women's Theatre Group's Betty Can Jump, was the first expression of Second Wave feminism in Melbourne theatre. (Denise Varney pg 25) When she returned to Australia in 1973 she became involved with the Australian National Playwrights' Conference, first as a playwright, and later for many years serving as a dramaturge. Her best-known work is The Rivers of China, featuring the short story writer Katherine Mansfield, which premiered at the Sydney Theatre Company in 1987. It won the Premier's Award in both NSW and Victoria, and is included by the Australian Society of Authors in its list of Australia's 200 best literary works. In Belonging: Australian Playwrighting in the 20th Century, critic John McCallum describes The Woman in the Window, featuring the poet Anna Akhmatova, as her masterpiece.

His courtesy name was Xifu () and his art name was Zhenchuan (),Britannica Kokusai Dai- Hyakkajiten article \\"Gui You-guang\\" (Â∏∞ÊúâÂÖâ, Ki Y≈´k≈ç in Japanese). Shogakukan.Daijisen entry \\"Gui Youguang\\" (Â∏∞ÊúâÂÖâ, Ki Y≈´k≈ç in Japanese). Gakken 2006. and he was also known as Xiangji Sheng (, literally Scholar of Xiangji). His prose writings were highly praised. People of his time regarded him as a modern-day Ouyang Xiu, an important writer of the earlier Song Dynasty, and later generations praised his works as \\"the best prose of the Ming Dynasty\\". He was one of the early masters of the xiaopin.  Names and titles   Youguang  When Gui's mother conceived him, it was said that there was a rainbow glowed in the yard, while its light reached the sky, which was deemed lucky. Accordingly, he was gave the name \\"Youguang\\", literally \\"There was a light\\" in Chinese.  Zhenchuan  Gui detested art names when he was young. Once he was notice as an exception without one at a party, thus the others began to call him \\"Zhenchuan\\". It is a compound of two geographical nouns: \\"zhen\\" refers to \\"Zhenze\\" (), the ancient name of Lake Tai which adjoins his hometown, while \\"chuan\\" is a synonym for river in Chinese, refers to the Yangtze River sometimes. However, Gui still rejected that until he met He Qitu (), an erudite scholar from Henan who happened to share the same art name with him. Gui took \\"Zhenchuan\\" out of admiration for He, he also made an analogy between they and Sima Xiangru together with Lin Xiangru.  Xiangji Sheng  Gui's ancestors once lived along a river call Xiangjijing () in Taicang during Yuan dynasty,Wang Xijun (ÁéãÈå´Áàµ; 1534‚Äì1611). Taipusi sicheng Guigong muzhiming (Â§™ÂÉïÂØ∫‰∏ûÊ≠∏ÂÖ¨Â¢ìË™åÈäò) [Gui Youguang's Epitaph] later he designate his sanctum as Xiangjixuan () to commemorate them probably. Hence, Gui called himself Xiangji Sheng. While \\"Xiangji\\" is supposed to be the abbreviation of \\"Xiangjixuan\\".  Biography  Gui Youguang was born in Kunshan, Suzhou Prefecture, a satellite city in south-east Jiangsu Province nowadays. His family had been a large, important family in the past, but by Gui Youguang's time it was falling increasingly into decay. When he was only seven years old, his mother died, leaving her husband to support their three sons and two daughters. After that, his family lived a much harder life; Gui learned about suffering and sorrow at a very early age. Because of his cleverness and hard work, Gui was able to write relatively good articles when he was only nine years old. At the age of ten, he wrote an article of several thousand words, called Qi xi () [On Begging Vinegar].Begging vinegar is an allusion in Analects (\\"Â≠∞Ë¨ÇÂæÆÁîüÈ´òÁõ¥ÔºüÊàñ‰πûÈÜØÁÑâÔºå‰πûË´∏ÂÖ∂ÈÑ∞ËÄåËàá‰πã„ÄÇ\\"). Gui utilized it here to discuss politics. Gui was qualified to take prefecture examination when he was 14. He came first in this examination when he was 20 years old. However, until 1540 Gui failed the provincial exam. He became Juren ranked second at age 35. In the meantime, his first wife, who came from Wei () clan, died. Then he married a woman who came from Wang () clan of Anting, which had once been prosperous. Since the clan was on the decline, a younger descendant sold the local mansion treasured by the other members as heritage to pay taxes. On that account, his new wife begged him to get a loan and redeem the mansion. In about 1541, he paid off all the debts eventually and moved to Anting, Jiading. Gui spent most of his time at Anting on reading. Moreover, he tutored up to hundreds students who worshipped him. During those intervening triennial springs, he went to Nanjing eight times to take the higher examinations but failed. In 1565, Gui finally got a Jinshi in his ninth examination. Gui became a Zhixian in Changxing at the age of sixty. When Gui was judging, he allowed local people to utter Wu Chinese instead of Mandarin so that they could state clearly. Besides, he seldom imprisoned the defendant if the case could be conciliated. Three years later, Gui was transferred to be a Tongpan (; an official position) in Shunde, he was in charge of local horse administration. In 1570, Gui went to Beijing to celebrate Longqing Emperor's birthday. Admired by Gao Gong and Zhao Zhenji (), he was promoted to be the Sicheng (; an official position) of Nanjing Taipusi (). But he was still kept in Beijing by Li Chunfang () to compile Shizong Shilu () for Jiajing Emperor. In the next year, Gui died of illness in Beijing at the age of 64. He was buried at Kunshan in 1575.  Family  Gui's father was Zheng (), while his mother was Zhou Gui (). He had two younger brothers: Youshang () and Yougong (); An elder sister Shujing () and a younger sister Shushun (). Gui had three wives and a concubine. His first wife's surname was Wei. They married in about 1529, five year later she died. She bore him a daughter and a son. In about 1536, he married to Wang. Wang died in about 1552, one year later, Gui married to his third wife Fei (). Hanhua () initially was a handmaiden accompanying Wei; when Wei married, she was only nine years old. After Wei's death, she became Gui's concubine, before she died at the age of 18.

Writings  Gui was one of mid-Ming notable writers of the xiaopin.Mair 2001. \\"Introduction: The Origins and Impact of Literati Culture\\", paragraph 22.

He criticized the later Revivalists such as Wang Shizhen (), a contemporary bureaucrat and scholar. Wang Shenzhong, Mao Kun, Tang Shunzhi and Gui etc. were bracketed together as Tang Song pai (, a school advocating Tang and Song dynasties' classic works of literature) afterwards, while Gui was regarded as the head of them. These writers of the mid-Ming created the canon of the eight great Tang and Songwriters which impact hitherto. Despite Wang Shizhen and Gui being horrid to each other, Wang expressed great esteem towards him and compared his works to those of Han Yu and Ouyang Xiu, after Gui's death.History of Ming, Vol.287 (\\"ÊúâÂÖâÂ∞ëÂ≠êÂ≠êÊÖï\\") Qian Qianyi praised his works as \\"the best prose of the Ming Dynasty\\" ().Nomura Ayuko, 2009.

In 1828, Tao Zhu, the Jiangsu Xunfu of that time, got permission from the emperor to memorialize Gui by establishing the Zhenchuan Academy, which was completed after three years‚Äôconstruction. It was closed in 1903. One year later, An Yuan and some other people founded the Zhenchuan Primary School at the former campus of Zhenchuan Academy. After several years, Zhenchuan junior high school was added to Zhenchuan Primary School.

History A company in New York City in the United States first offered installation of air conditioning for cars in 1933. Most of their customers operated limousines and luxury cars. On October 7, 1935, Ralph Peo of Houde Engineering, Buffalo, NY, applied for a patent for an \\"Air Cooling Unit for Automobiles\\". , was granted on November 16, 1937. In 1939, Packard became the first automobile manufacturer to offer an air conditioning unit in its cars. These bulky units were manufactured by Bishop and Babcock (B&B;), of Cleveland, Ohio and ordered on approximately 2,000 cars. The \\"Bishop and Babcock Weather Conditioner\\" also incorporated a heater. Cars ordered with this option were shipped from Packard's East Grand Boulevard facility to the B&B; factory where the conversion was performed. Once complete, the car was shipped to a local dealer for delivery to customers. Packard warranted and supported this conversion. However, it was not commercially successful because: *The main evaporator and blower system took up half of the trunk space (though this became less of a problem as trunks became larger in the post-war period). *It was superseded by more efficient systems in the post-war years. *It had no temperature thermostat or shut-off mechanism other than switching the blower off. (Cold air would still sometimes enter the car with any movement as the drive belt was continuously connected to the compressor‚Äîlater systems would use electrically operated clutches to remedy this problem.) *The several feet of plumbing going back and forth between the engine compartment and trunk proved unreliable in service. *The price, at US $274 ($4,692.12 in 2014 US dollars), was unaffordable to most people in depression/pre-war America. The option was discontinued after 1941. Chrysler Airtemp The 1953 Chrysler Imperial was one of the first production cars in twelve years to offer modern automobile air conditioning as an option, following tentative experiments by Packard in 1940 and Cadillac in 1941. Walter Chrysler had seen to the invention of Airtemp air conditioning in the 1930s for the Chrysler Building, and had offered it on cars in 1941-42, and again in 1951-52. The Airtemp was more advanced than rival automobile air conditioners by 1953. It was operated by a single switch on the dashboard marked with low, medium, and high positions. As the highest capacity unit available at that time, the system was capable of quickly cooling the passenger compartment and also reducing humidity, dust, pollen, and tobacco smoke. The system drew in more outside air than contemporary systems; thus, reducing the staleness associated with automotive air conditioning at the time. Instead of plastic tubes mounted on the rear window package shelf as on GM cars, small ducts directed cool air toward the ceiling of the car where it filtered down around the passengers instead of blowing directly on them, a feature that modern cars have lost. Cadillac, Buick, and Oldsmobile added air conditioning as an option on some of their models in the 1953 model year. All of these Frigidaire systems used separate engine and trunk mounted components. Nash integrated system Logo on a 1957 car with AMC factory installed air-conditioning system In 1954, the Nash Ambassador was the first American automobile to have a front-end, fully integrated heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning system. The Nash-Kelvinator corporation used its experience in refrigeration to introduce the automobile industry's first compact and affordable, single-unit heating and air conditioning system optional for its Nash models. This was the first mass market system with controls on the dash and an electric clutch. This system was also compact and serviceable with all of its components installed under the hood or in the cowl area. Combining heating, cooling, and ventilating, the new air conditioning system for the Nash cars was called the \\"All-Weather Eye\\". This followed the marketing name of \\"Weather Eye\\" for Nash's fresh-air automotive heating and ventilating system that was first used in 1938. With a single thermostatic control, the Nash passenger compartment air cooling option was \\"a good and remarkably inexpensive\\" system. The system had cold air for passengers enter through dash-mounted vents. Nash's exclusive \\"remarkable advance\\" was not only the \\"sophisticated\\" unified system, but also its $345 price that beat all other systems. Most competing systems used a separate heating system and an engine- mounted compressor, driven by the engine crankshaft via a belt, with an evaporator in the car's trunk to deliver cold air through the rear parcel shelf and overhead vents. General Motors offered a front-mounted air conditioning system made by its Harrison Division on 1954 Pontiacs with a straight-eight engine. It was very expensive and not a fully integrated system with separate controls and ducts for air distribution. The heater core continued to be a separate \\"Venti-Seat\\" or under the front seat system with its own controls. The unified alternative layout pioneered by Nash \\"became established practice and continues to form the basis of the modern and more sophisticated automatic climate control systems.\\" Growth in demand Air- conditioning for automobiles came into wide use from the late twentieth century. Although air conditioners use significant power, the drag of a car with closed windows is less than if the windows are open to cool the occupants. There has been much debate on the effect of air conditioning on the fuel efficiency of a vehicle. Factors such as wind resistance, aerodynamics and engine power and weight must be considered, to find the true difference between using the air conditioning system and not using it, when estimating the actual fuel mileage. Other factors can affect the engine, and an overall engine heat increase can affect the cooling system of the vehicle. The innovation was adopted quickly and new features to air conditioning like the Cadillac Comfort Control which was a completely automatic heating and cooling system set by dial thermostat was introduced as an industry first in the 1964 model year. By 1960 about 20% of all cars in the U.S. had air-conditioning, with the percentage increasing to 80% in the warm areas of the Southwest. American Motors made air conditioning standard equipment on all AMC Ambassadors starting with the 1968 model year, a first in the mass market, with a base price starting at $2,671. By 1969, 54% of domestic automobiles were equipped with air conditioning, with the feature needed not only for passenger comfort, but also to increase the car's resale value. Evaporative cooling A car cooler A car cooler is an automobile evaporative cooler, sometimes referred to as a swamp cooler.Hinckley, p. 54 \\"...it was actually an evaporative cooler ‚Äì something Californians and Southwesterners have on the roofs of their houses and often call 'swamp coolers' or 'swampies\\".\\" Most are aftermarket relatively inexpensive accessories consisting of an external window-mounted metal cylinder without moving parts, but internal under dashboard or center floor units with an electric fan are available. It was an early type of automobile air conditionerHinckley, p. 54 and is not used in modern cars relying on refrigerative systems to cool the interior. To cool the air it used latent heat (in other words, cooling by water evaporation).Sibley, p. 221 Water inside the device evaporates and in the process transfers heat from the surrounding air. The cool moisture-laden air is then directed to the inside of the car. The evaporate \\"cooling\\" effect decreases with humidity because the air is already saturated with water. Therefore, the lower the humidity, such as in dry desert regions, the better the system works. Car coolers were popular, especially among summer tourists visiting or crossing the southwestern United States states of California, Arizona, Texas, New Mexico, and Nevada. Operating principles A simple stylized diagram of the refrigeration cycle: 1) condensing coil, 2) expansion valve, 3) evaporator coil, 4) compressor Regassing the air conditioning of a Ford Focus. In the refrigeration cycle, heat is transported from the passenger compartment to the environment. A refrigerator is an example of such a system, as it transports the heat out of the interior and into the ambient environment. Circulating refrigerant gas vapor (which also carries the compressor lubricant oil across the system along with it) from the evaporator enters the gas compressor in the engine bay, usually an axial piston pump compressor, and is compressed to a higher pressure, resulting in a higher temperature as well. The hot, compressed refrigerant vapor is now at a temperature and pressure at which it can be condensed and is routed through a condenser, usually in front of the car's radiator. Here the refrigerant is cooled by air flowing across the condenser coils (originating from the vehicle's movement or from a fan, often the same fan of the cooling radiator if the condenser is mounted on it, automatically turned on when the vehicle is stationary or moving at low speeds) and condensed into a liquid. Thus, the circulating refrigerant rejects heat from the system and the heat is carried away by the air. In a thermal expansion valve air conditioning system, the condensed and pressurized liquid refrigerant is next routed through the receiver-drier, that is, a one way desiccant and filter cartridge that both dehydrates the refrigerant and compressor lubricant oil mixture in order to remove any residual water content (which would become ice inside the expansion valve and therefore clog it) that the vacuum done prior to the charging process didn't manage to remove from the system, and filters it in order to remove any solid particles carried by the mixture, in addition to acting as a storage vessel for any excess liquid refrigerant during low cooling demand periods, and then through the thermal expansion valve where it undergoes an abrupt reduction in pressure. That pressure reduction results in flash evaporation of a part of the liquid refrigerant, lowering its temperature. The cold refrigerant is then routed through the evaporator coil in the passenger compartment. When the expansion device is a simple fixed metering orifice, known as an orifice tube, the receiver-drier is instead located between the evaporator outlet and the compressor, and in this case it's known as an accumulator. In such an air conditioning system, the accumulator also prevents liquid refrigerant from reaching the compressor during low cooling demand periods. The air, often after being filtered by a cabin air filter, is blown by an adjustable speed electric powered centrifugal fan across the evaporator, causing the liquid part of the cold refrigerant mixture to evaporate as well, further lowering the temperature. The warm air is therefore cooled, and also deprived of any humidity (which condenses on the evaporator coils and is drained outside of the vehicle) in the process. It is then passed through a heater matrix, inside of which the engine's coolant circulates, where it can be reheated to a certain degree or even a certain temperature selected by the user and then delivered inside the vehicle's cabin through a set of adjustable vents. Another way of adjusting the desired air temperature, this time by working on the system's cooling capacity, is precisely regulating the centrifugal fan speed so that only the strictly required volumetric flow rate of air is cooled by the evaporator. The user is also given the option to close the vehicle's external air flaps, in order to achieve even faster and stronger cooling by recirculating the already cooled air inside the cabin to the evaporator. Finally, whenever the compressor is able to be commanded to operate in a reduced displacement, the vent temperature can also be controlled by acting upon the compressor's displacement. Evaporator freeze over, which stops air from flowing through the evaporator fins, can be prevented in different ways. A temperature switch or a thermistor can control the evaporator coil surface temperature, and a pressure switch or sensing element can monitor the suction pressure (which is in relationship with the refrigerant's evaporating temperature). Both control means can either act (either directly or by means of a control unit fed by their data) upon the compressor's clutch engagement status or, in the case of a variable displacement compressor, its displacement; additionally, a secondary valve located on the suction side can throttle the refrigerant flow so that the evaporator's outlet pressure doesn't fall below a precise value during system operation. To complete the refrigeration cycle, the refrigerant vapor is routed back into the compressor. The warmer the air that reaches the evaporator, the higher the pressure of the vapor mixture discharged from it and therefore the higher is the load placed on the compressor and therefore on the engine to keep the refrigerant flowing through the system. Compressor load is also proportional to the condensing temperature. The compressor can be driven by the car's engine (e.g. via a belt, often the serpentine belt, and an electromagnetically actuated clutch; an electronically actuated variable displacement compressor can also be always directly driven by a belt without the need of any clutch and magnet at all) or by an electric motor. Power consumption In a modern automobile, the A/C system will use around 4 horsepower (3 kW) of the engine's power, thus increasing fuel consumption of the vehicle.

He is the founder and editor of the art photography blog ‚ÄúThe Pandorian,‚Äù and his work has been shown internationally and at solo and group exhibitions worldwide. He also writes about and lectures on contemporary art, photography and fashion.  Early years  Pajdic was born to Serbian parents in Slavonski Brod, SR Croatia, SFR Yugoslavia, as one of three children. As a child he was fascinated by his grandfather, a talented bagpipe, violin and cuckoo-clock maker and a father who ran a successful cast iron company. His creative curiosity began at an early age and encompassed a range of influences. As a child, he would imitate birds‚Äô songs, collect feathers, mushrooms, flowers and talk to plants and animals.Retna Wooler. The Pandorian‚Äôs fashion-inspired artistry‚Äù JC Report, November 9, 2011.  Professional life  After high school, he moved to London to study fashion design at Central St. Martins College of Art and Design, graduating in 1994. He also attended Courtauld Institute of Art where he earned a master's degree in art history. Following graduation, he began experimenting with materials from tinsel to toilet paper for creations that appeared in video clips, on stages, in films and in New York's Metropolitan Museum.  The Pandorian  As well as curating art publications, producing exhibitions and travelling, Pajdic oversees The Pandorian, which receives more than 1.5 million visitors a month. Portraits of people Pajdic meets and discovers in his travels are woven into blog's narrative. Pajdic has said he prefers to photograph people he meets rather than professional models because of the beauty he finds in every individual. For each subject, Pajdic selects a quote or a time in history to form the basis of the shoot's art direction. The result is more like an online essay in photography form.  Hail, O Hail, Liberty!  In 2011, Pajdic's debuted ‚ÄúHail, O Hail, Liberty!‚Äù on a visual narrative of Greece, which earned him international attention for the century-old costumes combined with local designer wear. ‚ÄúAt first glance Athens looks completely chaotic, but then you realise there is a method to its madness and, in some strange way, everything works,‚Äù says Pajdic.Despina Pavlaki. Through a newer looking glass, p. 26. Athens News, October 24, 2011. During the photo shoot, Pajdic spent time wandering Athens accumulating more than 10,000 shots and observing the city's contrasts. ‚ÄúI was confronted with two very contrasting sides of the city: one was contemporary and young, and the other was ancient, steeped with the kind of history you cannot escape. I swear, the first time I went up to the Acropolis I felt I was closer to heaven than I‚Äôve ever been in my life.‚Äù But rather than focus on the differences, he tried to discover the bridges that keep the two worlds connected: ‚ÄúIt was kind of like an ongoing dialogue in my head, and that‚Äôs what this project is all about.‚Äù  Instant sharing  Like many of his other projects, Hail, O Hail, Liberty! was exclusively created for the web. Pajdic has said he believes the Internet has made it easier for artists to share their work instantly, rather than wait for galleries to display it. ‚ÄúWhen I first started out it was kind of hard to part with your work, but nowadays it‚Äôs all about sharing. We‚Äôre living in tough times and if I can contribute 0.00000001 points of beauty to this world, I‚Äôd want to do it as fast as I can, and nothing can beat the internet for speed. It‚Äôs a spectacular platform for artistic output and you don‚Äôt need to wait for the galleries to show your work. You can do it on your own right here, right now.‚Äù  Subjects and influences  Pajdic is forthcoming in interviews but ultimately rejects the idea of being defined by one thing. He once told an interviewer that he has ‚Äúalways rebelled against the idea of specializing in one thing and doing it for the rest of one‚Äôs life. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with it, of course, and we do need experts, but I believe we are capable of learning many different things. Dealing with stereotypes has always been very hard for me. If I had to state one profession for myself, then I really don‚Äôt know what that would be.‚Äù Pajdic's subjects are either long term friends, or newly made friends for life. ‚ÄúSometimes I could be inspired by a book I read, or a person I meet. Most of the time it happens in a moment when I meet a person who would be in my image. It is almost like alchemy between two people, a chemistry between me on one side of a camera and a person I shoot. Sometimes I would have a starting idea but end up shooting something completely different. I often leave things to the very last moment. Without much controlling and planning there is a space in which magic can happen.‚Äù Retna Wooler, ‚ÄùPredrag Pajdic/Behold the pantomime of the Pandorian‚Äù Style Magazine, p. 42. Fall 2011. Pajdic has said his inspirational sources include Leonardo da Vinci, Christian Dior, Crist√≥bal Balenciaga and Jean Cocteau. Shows and exhibitions Pajdic's artwork can be found at the British Museum in London and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. He was also one of the judges for the prestigious South African contemporary art award Spier Contemporary 2007. His work has been shown internationally in various solo and group exhibitions, including: 'Delay', Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam (2004); 'To whom it may Concern', nn Foundation for Contemporary Art, Rotterdam (2004); 'The Presidency', Exit Art, New York (2004); 'Memory', Salina Art Center, Salina (2004); 'Garden' Castle Vault, Southampton (2004); 'Terrorvision', Exit Art, New York (2004), 'Blackout', Salon of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Belgrade (2003). In 2010, Pajdic curated Lingering Whispers, a London exhibition of 40 international artists hunting for alternative ways of expression during a worldwide economic crisis. In 2011, About 20 Victorian glass plates were discovered in an attic of a home in Texas, United States. Once cleaned from 100 years of dust, they revealed images of children from a portrait studio. Pajdic partnered with Santa Fe artist Alexandra Eldridge on a project called \\"There Is No Such Thing As The End,\\" which re-imagined those images on vintage Chinese scrolls through a palimpsest of painting, printing, collage and drawing. Eldridge and Pajdic described the project as a way to bridge the world of the living with that of the dead.http://blog.huskmagazine.de/#2337212/A-Celebration-of-Life His curatorial projects include Paranoia, Leeds City Art Gallery, 2006, an exhibition of 40 international artists; Recognise, Contemporary Art Platform, London 2007, with more than 40 international artists whose work relates to the Middle East;T.J.

After the election, the composition of the council was *Labour 24 *Conservative 19 *Liberal Democrats 8 *Independent 1 Background Before the election the Conservatives ran the council with 20 seats and the backing of the 7 Liberal Democrats. Labour was in opposition despite being the largest group on the council with 24 seats and needed 3 gains to take control. 19 of the 52 seats on the council were being elected, with extra seats contested in Stanwix Rural and Upperby wards after the sitting councillors, Conservative Edward Firth and Labour's Caroline Watson, stood down. Labour were defending 9 seats, compared to 8 for the Conservatives and 2 Liberal Democrats. Candidates at the election included 11 independents standing to protest against the demolition of the Warwick Road cinema and the first candidate from the English Democrats Party in Belah ward. Before the election top Labour targets were reported as being Morton and Castle from the Liberal Democrats and Belah from the Conservatives. The Conservatives were targeting Yewdale from Labour, while the Liberal Democrats aimed to take Dalston from the Conservatives. Election result Labour remained the largest party on the council with 24 councillors after only one seat changed hands. The Liberal Democrats gained Dalston from the Conservatives, to go up to 8 seats, while the Conservatives dropped to 19 and there remained 1 independent. Overall turnout at the election was 34.6%, down from 42.6% at the 2004 election. Following the election Michael Boaden became the new leader of the Labour group, after challenging the previous leader Heather Bradley. However Conservative Mike Mitchelson remained as council leader after being re-elected by 26 votes to 25 at the annual council meeting on 22 May.

These conveyed interactions distinctively seek to challenge the conventional modes of portraying and experiencing sexually explicit content. Scholar Ingrid Ryberg additionally includes two main objectives of queer pornography in her definition as \\"interrogating and troubling gender and sexual categories and aiming at sexual arousal.\\" Queer porn works to have authentic representations with respect to the sexual orientations, gender identities and desires of the performers in it. It differs from heterosexual pornography, gay pornography, or lesbian pornography, because queer porn will often be a partnering of performers outside traditional pornographic categories. Gay porn falls into a similar situation as heterosexual porn by putting an emphasis on androcentric imagery of pleasure, as scholar Richard Dyer argues, and often glorifies the homonormative, masculine body-type and behavior. To appear as inclusive, gay porn will exotify differences. Performers' bodies in queer pornography are key to providing a difference between it and other categories of pornography.Jacobs, Katrien, Marije Janssen, and matteo Pasquinelli. C‚Äôlickme : A Netporn Studies Reader. Amsterdam: Institute of Network Cultures, 2007. Print. For example, a DVD may have one scene which shows a transgender lesbian with a cisgender femme- identified queer woman, while the next scene may showcase two transgender queer-identified men. The genre of queer pornography as defined above is relatively recent and has been popularized and distributed by adult film companies such as Pink and White Productions, Trouble Films, Real Queer Productions among others. While porn is not limited to adult cinema and can exist in the context of a variety of media such as queer written pornography, the currently produced queer porn is mostly in the form of video. Some prominent queer producers include Shine Louise Houston, Chelsea Poe, and April Flores who attempt to challenge the filming methods within the porn industry. Typically within the Porn Industry, the producer and director have the majority of control over how each scene will be performed, who is showcased in each set, and creating a differential of performers‚Äô salaries based on their popularity. Queer pornography counters these practices by actively engaging performers in the creations of scenes allowing them to form more organically as a collaboration with a more horizontal access of control rather than a hierarchically vertical system. Queer porn similarly celebrates ejaculation but with some signification differences to conventional porn. Unlike in the mainstream industry, the performer does not have a financial bonus for providing such a \\"money shot.\\" Directors only encourage performers to perform an orgasm if/when the actors feel like it. Since the money shot in conventional porn relies of visibility for the camera, it necessarily centers on showing external ejaculation of the penis as the ultimate climax. This reflects attention back to the male centered gaze and a representative instance of phallic power and pleasure. Queer porn attempts to broaden such a delineation of phallic centered climax and the pornographic production.  Discourses on Queer Pornography  Queer Pornography has been attracting academic attention since the 2000s. A challenge within queer pornography is that some labeled queer porn may depict scenarios that could be part of any heterosexual mainstream pornographic film. This follows academic Niels van Doorn's concept of the ‚Äúpornoscript,‚Äù eroticizing heterosexual difference and focusing on the male subject position. For example, a scene from Real Queer Productions's Fluid depicts a threesome with elements of submissions and dominance, rough vaginal and anal penetration, and external male ejaculation. The film's adherence to the pornographic conventions is predictable and serialized. However, further inspection into queer porn that appears like heteronormative pornography reveals particular parody of serial strategy to expose gender construction within most conventional pornography. This process creates a queer version of the model of \\"subversive repetition\\" theorized by academic Judith Butler. Drawing particular attention to such a facet through imitation permits its productive act of deconstruction. Thus, queer pornography can disassemble the pornographic norm by mimicking it. Additionally, queer pornography clearly reveals the imitative process of gender identification when introducing the figure of the transgender man. Compared to trans woman(male-to-female) individuals depicted across other types of pornography, female-to-male trans men appear significantly in feminist and queer pornography. Films of queer pornography make \\"deviant\\" sexualities more visible by simultaneously starting a process of their normalization. So, in order to avoid creating a new kind of norm, queer pornography constantly works along the edge of the gender system. For example, when strap-on dildos made their appearance in queer pornography leaving viewers guessing whether they were faced with a \\"real\\" penis or a dildo, they soon became a common sight. While these strap-on dildos originally offered new ways of thinking about gender and sexuality, their ubiquitous use risked losing their subversive power. As scholar Sarah Schaschek writes, ‚ÄúIf heterosexual pornography accentuates clearly defined identity categories such as class, age, ethnicity, sexuality, or gender, queer films tend to reveal the high degree of stylization behind these identities‚Äù.

Ramos Mattei's career was a multifaceted one, as were his scholarly writings. A student of Puerto Rico in general, he approached insular issues in the broadest possible perspective. His work was often explicitly comparative but with a regional, Caribbean-wide twist in its implications. He was an active member of the Association of Caribbean Historians, where he was instrumental in establishing fruitful interaction between his fellow historians in Puerto Rico and those of other Caribbean nations. Political interests Ramos Mattei's intellectual passion revolved around the peculiar historical processes of his native Puerto Rican society where he wrote about its enduring and perplexing colonial drama. In this regard, he was most interested in the life and thought of Ramon Emeterio Betances, the Puerto Rican abolitionist, revolutionary, and \\"father of the Puerto Rican nation\\". Ramos' contributions in this field was almost as intense as his contributions to the history of the sugar cane industry. Works Ramos Mattei is best known for his work on the transition from the hacienda to the modern land-and-factory combination in Puerto Rico's sugar sector.

By the second half of the 4th millennium BCE, the gemstone lapis lazuli was being traded from its only known source in the ancient world‚ÄîBadakhshan, in what is now northeastern Afghanistan‚Äîas far as Mesopotamia and Egypt. By the 3rd millennium BCE, the lapis lazuli trade was extended to Harappa, Lothal and Mohenjo-daro in the Indus Valley Civilization of modern-day Pakistan and northwestern India. The Indus Valley was also known as Meluhha, the earliest maritime trading partner of the Sumerians and Akkadians in Mesopotamia. The ancient harbor constructed in Lothal, India, around 2400 BCE is the oldest seafaring harbour known.

In 1994, excavators discovered an incised ceramic shard with the serekh sign of Narmer, dating to c. 3000 BCE. Mineralogical studies reveal the shard to be a fragment of a wine jar exported from the Nile valley to Palestine. Due to Egypt's climate, wine was very rare and nearly impossible to produce within the limits of Egypt. In order to obtain wine, Egyptians had to import it from Greece, Phoenicia, and Palestine. These early friendships played a key role in Egypt's ability to conduct trade and acquire goods that were needed. Model of a paddling funerary boat from the tomb of Meketre. From the time of the Twelfth dynasty of Egypt, early in the reign of Amenemhat I, circa 1931‚Äì1975 BCE. The Palermo stone mentions King Sneferu of the Fourth Dynasty sending ships to import high-quality cedar from Lebanon. In one scene in the pyramid of Pharaoh Sahure of the Fifth Dynasty, Egyptians are returning with huge cedar trees. Sahure's name is found stamped on a thin piece of gold on a Lebanon chair, and 5th dynasty cartouches were found in Lebanon stone vessels. Other scenes in his temple depict Syrian bears. The Palermo stone also mentions expeditions to Sinai as well as to the diorite quarries northwest of Abu Simbel. The oldest known expedition to the Land of Punt was organized by Sahure, which apparently yielded a quantity of myrrh, along with malachite and electrum. Around 1950 BCE, in the reign of Mentuhotep III, an officer named Hennu made one or more voyages to Punt. In the 15th century BCE, Nehsi conducted a very famous expedition for Queen Hatshepsut to obtain myrrh; a report of that voyage survives on a relief in Hatshepsut's funerary temple at Deir el-Bahri. Several of her successors, including Thutmoses III, also organized expeditions to Punt.

The medium-term aim is to restore the current leased length of one quarter of a mile: an addition of of single track mainline with a loop through the platforms. The long-term aim is to extend north towards Lamb House Bridge, and to provide a rail link with Sturminster Newton, working in harmony with the North Dorset Trailway. Track has been laid through the station using 95 bullhead rail extending to the Church gate on the current southern boundary. The signal box, coal store, motor trolley hut, permanent way huts, signals and pole route have been rebuilt. The NDRT has rebuilt the 400 foot Down platform wall and replaced and repaired the platform edge slabs. The North Dorset Trailway runs alongside the formation and up over the 'down' platform. The electrical supply has been improved and the Museum improved. The Station Gardens are also a prominent feature for the 28,000 visitors that come annually. The NDRT membership in 2017 exceeded 200 for the first time. Buildings The station building currently houses a cafe, shop, work room, separate toilet facilities for ladies and gentlemen. The registered museum displays some of the artefacts donated over the years. The Signal box has been rebuilt and fitted with one signal. The south end of the up platform has been rebuilt and the picnic area above landscaped with a colourful garden - an outdoor 'O' scale model railway was built there but was removed in 2019. A new siding was laid to accommodate the catering carriage at present outside the main station platform which serves as additional caf√© accommodation and is available for hire for private functions. The down platform waiting shelter has been rebuilt in its original position and serves as storage. Stations *Sturminster Newton - The membership voted in 2017 to rebuild the line towards Sturminster Newton, but since then almost no progress has been made and the credibility of the committee's intentions is in considerable doubt. *Shillingstone - a lease 400 yard long between buffers *Stourpaine & Durweston Halt - in private hands Activity In 2009, of the up main track through the station was laid and ballasted using 110a and 113a flat bottom rail and wooden sleepers. The Ruston & Hornsby diesel shunter was moved from the isolated goods dock. This was the first standard gauge loco on the Somerset & Dorset mainline south of the Mendips and north of Blandford, since the demolition train departed in July 1967, exactly 42 years before. Progress in 2010 included acquiring a tracked Priestman Mustang excavator, finishing construction of the up platform wall, regrading of the cattle dock track bed and preparations for track-laying, and the connection of the station to the mains drainage system. On 9 and 10 May 2015 two new arrivals were added to the stations fleet, a class 48DS 4wd Ruston a long time since the previous Ruston was sold. This arrived along with an ex-virgin cross-country kitchen coach No.11062. This coach was sold in 2019. On 12 August 2015 a class 08 shunter was bought by the NDRT with money from a legacy on the promise to name it after the deceased. This class 08 (No.08 995) low cabbed version is only one of three survivors of this variant. She was having repairs when she was suddenly sold in early 2020. A small diesel locomotive arrived in 2020. Restoration work on one steam engine (30075) started again in 2020 after two and a half years of inactivity. 30076 remains as it was when delivered in 2015. Purchase of the \\"Pacer\\" unit promised for early 2020 was cancelled. A road-railer and a two-road mechanical maintenance workshop were donated to the Trust in 2014 to support the extension of the line towards Sturminster Newton. Both these investments were sold at a loss in 2018-9 and the will of the committee to extend the line is in considerable doubt. Land donated to the Trust to enable the extension of the line was the object of preparations by the committee to sell it to an adjacent landowner, who was a Trustee, in 2017. Following member objections, this plan was shelved but committee intentions remain under scrutiny. Operations are constrained to the 400-yard long lease. History After the closure of Shillingstone railway station on 7 March 1966, and a few years post closure, the Dorset County Council purchased the trackbed for a proposed Shillingstone by-pass. Various furniture manufacturing companies were sited in the former station yard, and over 1970s, industrial buildings were constructed, some of them making partial use of the station building. By December 2002, the by-pass plan had been shelved and the station was derelict. Dorset County Council decided to dispose of the redundant station, and, after protracted negotiations, lasting from 1998 to 2005, the North Dorset Railway Trust took signed a lease for the former station site. The Trust's plan is to reopen the station as a tourist attraction, and restore the site to as it looked in the 1950s and 60s. Restoration work commenced in 2006, and over the years, the main building was repaired, a replica signal box with a correct Stevens frame and tablet machines, was constructed by volunteers. The Porters office was reconstructed, and the Parcels office restored. Track was laid in the dock and up platform. This work is now nearing completion.

They consume without manufacturing. They project feelings over principles. In general terms, they lack a spirit of sacrifice because they abhor the notion of \\"Objective Values\\" and so lack the will to re-create or advance the social ethos created by their parent's generation.\\" In cultural terms, the generation that followed the \\"Greatest Generation\\" were the baby boomers (essentially, the children of the Greatest Generation between 1945‚Äì1965). The \\"Boomers\\" fit the classic definition of a \\"leisure class\\", which Veblen described as being characterised by Conspicuous Consumption. Morris extends Veblen's notion of the 'leisure class, saying: \\"It is ultimately not a question of economic utility which underlines the idea of conspicuous consumption. It is rather consumption as a lack of restraint or prudence in all things; with an isometric emphasis driven by a gyroscopic self-indulgence. It is to think, feel or defend this absence of restraint as a concept of life, which is today everywhere, it seems, extant.\\" Specific Terms In Rescue America, Salamone and Morris argue the parents of the leisure class (the baby boomers) were prudential but also understandably aspirational. They wanted better for their children than they had. This gave license to a new imprudence characterised by an attitude of entitlement and a culture of complaint. (See also: The Culture of Complaint by Robert Hughes, which also influenced Morris's account of prosperity as paradoxical). In his recent book Bahama Modes: Notes Toward a Definition of Culture,https://www.createspace.com/pub/community/give.review.do?id=1079699&rewrite;=true Professor Morris says the following: \\"It is quite difficult to press a label upon an entire generation. However, one speaks of the 'paradox of prosperity' in specific terms as a thesis. That is to say, one finds lines of development which possess explanatory potency for the habitudes of people with certain generational similarities. Then what we discover is a disposition in politics, in organizational culture, the literary productions and in the culture at large. Salamone and I examined such questions in Rescue America. From that disposition, such generations as I have described, which have had no experience of unassignable routine sacrifice, reveal a tendency, which may be summed in his way: they move values toward behavior, rather than behavior toward values\\".

In the United States, it was published under the title Inferno: The World at War, 1939-1945. Synopsis All Hell Let Loose covers the entire span of World War II, following the military developments of the war but focusing on the reactions and experiences of different individuals (both uniformed and civilian). Reviews refer to the book as an \\"everyman's story\\" made up of accounts from those with lesser roles in the conflict; \\"ranging from ship's cooks to wireless operators, farmers and housewives to typists and black marketeers.\\" The book addresses several \\"triumphalist\\" aspects of written war history by focusing on the \\"misery, heroism and endurance\\" of individual accounts. Hastings concludes that whilst the Nazis fought individual battles well, their overall war effort showed \\"stunning incompetence\\". Critical reception Martin Rubin, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle, gave a positive review, calling All Hell Let Loose \\"a true distillation of everything this historian has learned from a lifetime of scholarship\\". In a review in The Observer, Ian Thomson noted the book's British-centric Western Front narrative, although not ignoring other aspects of the war, and called it \\"immensely long, but extremely readable\\". Thomson also says that Hastings has \\"a faint antipathy towards foreigners\\". Jonathan Sumption criticised the book's \\"relentlessly pessimistic message\\" and says that the everyman perspective gives a distorted view of the war.

(born: ‚Äì died: 21 June 1413) was a member of the House of Griffins, a Duke of Pomerania-Stettin and for a while governor of the Mittelmark. Life Duke Swantibor III was a son of Barnim III, nicknamed the church founder (born: ; died: 1368), who ruled in the Teilherzogtum of Pomerania-Stettin. After Barnim III's death in 1368, his three surviving sons Casimir III, Swantibor III and Bogislaw VII ruled Pomerania-Stettin jointly. At the time of their succession to power, Denmark under King Waldemar IV of Denmark was at war with the Hanseatic League and its allies, in particular Duke Albert II of Mecklenburg. The late Duke Barnim III had sided with Denmark. His sons, however, made peace with Albert on 7 November 1368 and took a neutral stance towards Denmark. This brought them into conflict with Margrave Otto of Brandenburg, who sided with Denmark. This conflict escalated to war. Duke Casimir III died during the siege of Chojna in 1372. After Casimir's death, Swantibor III and Bogislaw VII ruled jointly, with Swantibor III now playing the leading role. He was faced with the challenge to maintain the position of Pomerania, which was splintered into several Teilherzogtumer, against its neighbours, in particular, against Brandenburg. When Emperor Charles IV (1316‚Äì1378) tried to win Brandenburg for his relatives, Swantibor initially feared that Charles IV would revive old claims that Brandenburg held suzerainty over Pomerania. On 17 May 1373 all the Pomeranian dukes, that is, Swantibor III and Bogislaw VII from Pomerania-Stettin, Wartislaw VI and Bogislaw VI from Pomerania-Wolgast, Bogislaw V of Pomerania-Stolp and Philip of Rehberg, Bishop of Cammin, joined forces to protect their interests and their common ownership of Pomerania. When Emperor Charles IV had acquired Brandenburg for his family by the Treaty of F√ºrstenwalde of 15 August 1373, however, Charles initiated a friendly relation with the Pomeranian dukes, contrary to their expectations, perhaps because he had married Bogislaw V's daughter, Elisabeth of Pomerania. Charles IV was particularly friendly with Swantibor, who occasionally participated in imperial affairs, and who served as an imperial judge. The situation in Pomerania remained disorganized. The Dukes had conflicts with the Pomeranian cities and were short of funds due to their ongoing feuds. The relation with the neighbouring Teutonic Knights was inconsistent. In 1388, Swantibor III and Bogislaw VII served the order for a while. In 1403, however, Swantibor tried to make his son Otto II archbishop of Riga, against the will of the Order, who supported John of Wallenrode as their candidate for the position. In the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, a Pomeranian contingent led by Swantibor's son Casimir V, fought on the side of the Order. The Order lost the battle and Casimir was taken prisoner by the victorious Poles. He was, however, released soon afterwards. In 1388, Charles IV's son Sigismund (1368‚Äì1437) enfeoffed Jobst of Moravia (1351‚Äì1411) with the Margraviate of Brandenburg. Conflicts erupted again between Brandenburg and Pomerania. In 1409, a compromise was reached between Jobst and Swantibor and Jobst enfeoffed Swantibor with the Lordship of Beeskow. Swantibor then fell into disputes with the local nobility in Beeskow, who had previously supported him against Jobst. After Jobst died in 1411, Sigismund enfeoffed Brandenburg to Burgrave Frederick VI of Nuremberg, who later became Elector of Brandenburg as Frederick I. Swantibor initially remained on his post as governor of the Mittelmark. In 1412, however, he retired ane left the business of government to his sons.von B√ºlow, p. 785-787 Swantibor's sons soon fell into military conflicts with Frederick and Dukes Otto II and Casimir V defeated Frederick in the second Battle at the Kremmen Causeway. Swantibor III died on 21 June 1413, while the conflict with Brandenburg was still raging. He was buried in the Cistercian monastery at Ko≈Çbacz. The verdict of the historian Martin Wehrmann (1861‚Äì1937) was the Duke Swantibor seems to have been an energetic and capable ruler, who was unfortunately, due to the condition of his country, unable to achieve permanent results.Wehrmann, p. 640-641 Marriage and issue In 1374, Swantibor III married Anna, the daughter of the Burgrave Albert the Beautiful of Nuremberg, and granddaughter of Frederick IV, Burgrave of Nuremberg.

It is one of only two works of art definitively identifiable as a depiction of the poet; the other is the statue erected as his funeral monument in Shakespeare's home town of Stratford-upon-Avon. Both are posthumous. While its role as a portrait frontispiece is typical of publications from the era, the exact circumstances surrounding the making of the engraving are unknown. It is uncertain which of two \\"Martin Droeshouts\\" created the engraving and it is not known to what extent the features were copied from an existing painting or drawing. Critics have generally been unimpressed by it as a work of art, although the engraving has had a few defenders, and exponents of the Shakespeare authorship question have claimed to find coded messages within it. States The portrait exists in two \\"states\\", or distinct versions of the image, printed from the same plate by Droeshout himself. Examples of the first state are very rare, existing in only four copies.Tarnya Cooper, Searching for Shakespeare, National Portrait Gallery; Yale Center for British Art, p. 48. These were probably test printings, created so that the engraver could see whether some alterations needed to be made. The overwhelming majority of surviving copies of the First Folio use the second state, which has heavier shadows and other minor differences, notably in the jawline and the moustache. Later copies of the second state, with minor retouching, were also printed from the plate by Thomas Cotes in 1632, for Robert Allot's Second Folio, a new edition of the collected plays.National Portrait Gallery It was also reused in later folios, although by then the plate was beginning to wear out and was heavily re-engraved. The original plate was still being used up to the Fourth Folio of 1685 (heavily retouched) Sarah Werner, Four States of Shakespeare: the Droeshout Portrait,‚Äù , retrieved 2017-12-22. and then disappears. Already in 1640 William Marshall had copied and adapted the design on a new plate for John Benson's edition of Shakespeare's sonnets. All subsequent engraved reprintings of the portrait were made by later engravers copying the original printed image. Authorship Droushout's signature, under the image at the left The engraving is signed under the image at the left, \\"Martin Droeshout. sculpsit. London\\". The Droeshouts were a family of artists from the Netherlands, who had moved to Britain. Because there were two members of the family named Martin there has been some dispute about which of the two created the engraving. Most sources state that the engraver was Martin Droeshout the Younger (1601 ‚Äì after 1639), the son of Michael Droeshout, an immigrant from Brussels. Except for his date of birth and parentage, very little is known about Martin the Younger, but since his father was an engraver, it has been assumed that Martin followed in his father's footsteps, and that he made the engraving of Shakespeare. As he was 15 when Shakespeare died, he may never have seen him and it has been assumed that he worked from an existing image. Research by Mary Edmond into the Droeshout family revealed new information about Martin Droeshout the Elder (c. 1560s ‚Äì 1642), who was the uncle of the younger Martin. Edmond shows that Droeshout the Elder was a member of the Painter-Stainer's Company. Edmond writes, In 1991 Christiaan Schuckman discovered a set of signed plates in Madrid that can be attributed to the engraver of the First Folio portrait. These plates bear Droeshout's signature and are stylistically similar to his portrait of Shakespeare. (They include a portrait of the priest and writer Franciso de la Pe√±a that has a striking resemblance to the English poet). On the evidence of these plates, which were made between 1635 and 1639, Schuckman attributed the portrait of Shakespeare to the younger Martin and suggested that the engraver had converted to Catholicism and emigrated to Spain in 1635, where he continued to work.Print Quarterly VIII (1991), pp. 40-43. More recently, June Schlueter has found evidence that Martin the Elder was in London when the engraver of the First Folio portrait was known to be in Madrid.June Schlueter, \\"Martin Droeshout Redivivus: Reassessing the Folio Engraving of Shakespeare\\", Shakespeare Survey 60. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 240. Although she began her archival research hoping to prove Edmond's assertion that the elder Martin was the Shakespeare engraver, Schlueter concludes that the newly discovered evidence actually supports the younger.June Schlueter, \\"Martin Droeshout Redivivus: Reassessing the Folio Engraving of Shakespeare\\", Shakespeare Survey 60. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 242. The traditional attribution to Droeshout the younger can also be supported on stylistic grounds. A drawing known to be by Droeshout the elder appears to show superior artistic skill than the work of his nephew, and the clumsy features of the depiction of Shakespeare's body resemble other prints by Droeshout the Younger. The attribution to the younger artist is provisionally accepted by the National Portrait Gallery. Significance The engraving is praised by Shakespeare's friend Ben Jonson in his poem To the Reader printed alongside it, in which he says that it is a good likeness of the poet. He writes that \\"the graver had a strife / With nature to outdo the life\\" and that he has \\"hit his face\\" accurately. He adds that the engraver could not represent Shakespeare's \\"wit\\", for which the viewer will have to read the book. Because of this testimony to the accuracy of the portrait, commentators have used the Droeshout print as a standard by which to judge other portraits alleged to depict Shakespeare. As the 19th-century artist and writer Abraham Wivell put it, > It is, as I may say, the key to unlock and detect almost all the impositions > that have, at various times, arrested so much of public attention. It is a > witness that can refute all false evidence, and will satisfy every > discerner, how to appreciate, how to convict.Wivell, Abraham, An inquiry > into the history, authenticity, & characteristics of the Shakspeare > portraits: in which the criticisms of Malone, Steevens, Boaden, & others, > are examined, confirmed, or refuted. Embracing the Felton, the Chandos, the > Duke of Somerset's pictures, the Droeshout print, and the monument of > Shakspeare, at Stratford; together with an expos√© of the spurious pictures > and prints, 1827, p. 56. In a similar vein, Tarnya Cooper, in 2006, writes that \\"it is the only portrait that definitely provides us with a reasonable idea of Shakespeare's appearance\\". Source image The fake \\"Flower portrait\\" of Shakespeare In addition to its use as a template to judge the authenticity of other images, scholars have also speculated about the original source used by Droeshout himself. The 19th-century scholar George Scharf argued on the basis of the inconsistencies in the lights and shadows that the original image would have been \\"either a limning or a crayon drawing\\". These typically used outlines rather than chiaroscuro modelling. He deduced that Droeshout had inexpertly attempted to add modelling shadows.George Scharf, On the Principal Portraits of William Shakespeare, London, Spottiswoode, 1864, p. 3. Mary Edmond points out that Droeshout the Elder seems to have had an association with Marcus Gheeraerts the portraitist, and notes that there is evidence that a portrait of Shakespeare by Gheeraerts may have once existed. She surmises that Droeshout's engraving may have been derived from this lost portrait.Mary Edmond, \\"It was for gentle Shakespeare cut\\". Shakespeare Quarterly 42.3 (1991), p. 344. Cooper argues that the poor drawing and modelling of the doublet and collar suggests that Droeshout was copying a lost drawing or painting that only depicted Shakespeare's head and shoulders. The body was added by the engraver himself, as was common practice. In the 19th century a painting that came to be known as the Flower portrait was discovered, inscribed with the date 1609 and painted on an authentic 17th-century panel. It was initially widely accepted as the original work from which Droeshout had copied his engraving, but in 1905 the art scholar Marion Spielmann demonstrated that the portrait corresponded to the second state of Droeshout's print. Taking the view that if it were the source, the first state would be closest, he concluded that it was a copy from the print.Paul Bertram and Frank Cossa, 'Willm Shakespeare 1609': The Flower Portrait Revisited, Shakespeare Quarterly, Vol. 37, No. 1 (Spring, 1986), pp. 83‚Äì96 In 2005 chemical analysis proved the portrait to be a 19th-century fake painted over an authentic 17th- century image.Tarnya Cooper, Searching for Shakespeare, Yale University Press, 2006, pp. 72‚Äì4 Critical evaluations Heaton, Newcastle upon Tyne The poor modelling and the clumsy relationship between the head and the body have led many critics to see the print as a poor representation of the poet. J. Dover Wilson called it a \\"pudding faced effigy\\".Marjorie B. Garber, Profiling Shakespeare, Taylor & Francis, 24 Mar 2008, p. 221. Sidney Lee wrote that \\"The face is long and the forehead high; the one ear which is visible is shapeless; the top of the head is bald, but the hair falls in abundance over the ears.\\" Samuel Schoenbaum was equally dismissive: Northrop Frye said that the portrait makes Shakespeare \\"look like an idiot.\\" Cooper notes that \\"the art of printmaking in England was underdeveloped and there were relatively few skilled engravers. Yet even by the less exacting standards observed in England, the Droeshout engraving is poorly proportioned.\\" Benjamin Roland Lewis observes that \\"virtually all of Droeshout's work shows the same artistic defects. He was an engraver after the conventional manner, and not a creative artist.\\"Benjamin Roland Lewis, The Shakespeare documents: facsimiles, transliterations, translations, & commentary, Volume 2, Greenwood Press, 1969, pp. 553‚Äì556. Not all critics have been so harsh. The 19th-century writer James Boaden wrote that \\"to me the portrait exhibits an aspect of calm benevolence and tender thought, great comprehension and a kind of mixt feeling, as when melancholy yields to the suggestions of fancy\\". He added that his friend John Philip Kemble thought this \\"despised work\\" was more characteristic of Shakespeare than any other known portrait.James Boaden, An inquiry into the authenticity of various pictures and prints: which, from the decease of the poet to our own times, have been offered to the public as portraits of Shakspeare: containing a careful examination of the evidence on which they claim to be received; by which the pretended portraits have been rejected, the genuine confirmed and established, illustrated by accurate and finished engravings, by the ablest artists, from such originals as were of indisputable authority, R. Triphook, 1824, pp. 16‚Äì18. More recently, Park Honan has written that \\"if the portrait lacks the 'sparkle' of a witty poet, it suggests the inwardness of a writer of great intelligence, an independent man who is not insensitive to the pain of others.\\"Honan, Park, Shakespeare: A Life, Oxford University Press 1998, p. 324. Conspiracy theories The double line created by the space between the shadow-line above the jaw and the jawline itself is claimed by some conspiracy theorists to suggest that Shakespeare's face is a mask. Proponents of the Shakespeare authorship question, who assert that someone other than Shakespeare was the real author of the plays attributed to him, have claimed to find hidden signs in the portrait pointing to this supposed secret. Indeed, Dover Wilson suggested that the poor quality of the Droeshout and funeral effigy images are the underlying reason for \\"the campaign against 'the man from Stratford' and the attempts to dethrone him in favour of Lord Bacon, the Earl of Derby, the Earl of Oxford, or whatever coroneted pretender may be in vogue at the present moment.\\" In 1911 William Stone Booth published a book claiming to demonstrate that the features of the engraving were \\"anatomically identical\\" to those of Francis Bacon, proving that he wrote the works. He achieved this by creating \\"combination images\\" from several portraits of Bacon and then superimposing them on the engraving.William Stone Booth, Droeshout Portrait of William Shakespeare an Experiment in Identification, Privately printed, 1911. Using similar methods Charles Sidney Beauclerk subsequently concluded that the portrait depicted the Earl of Oxford.Percy Allen, The Life Story of Edward de Vere as \\"William Shakespeare\\", Palmer, 1932, pp. 319‚Äì28 In 1995 Lillian Schwartz, using a computerised version of the same technique, argued that it was based on a portrait of Queen Elizabeth I.Lillian Schwartz, \\"The Art Historian's Computer\\" Scientific American, April 1995, pp. 106‚Äì11. See also Terry Ross, \\"The Droeshout Engraving of Shakespeare: Why It's NOT Queen Elizabeth\\". An alternative approach has been to claim that the portrait depicts William Shakespeare, but does so in a way designed to ridicule him by making him look ugly, or to suggest that he is a mask for a hidden author. The double line created by the gap between the modelling shadow and the jawline has been used to suggest that it is a mask, as has the shape of the doublet, which is claimed to represent both the back and front of the body. Thus Edwin Durning- Lawrence asserts that \\"there is no question ‚Äì there can be no possible question ‚Äì that in fact it is a cunningly drawn cryptographic picture, shewing two left arms and a mask ... Especially note that the ear is a mask ear and stands out curiously; note also how distinct the line shewing the edge of the mask appears.\\"Durning-Lawrence also claims that other engravings by Droeshout \\"may be similarly correctly characterised as cunningly composed, in order to reveal the true facts of the authorship of such works, unto those who were capable of grasping the hidden meaning of his engravings.\\" Edwin Durning- Lawrence, Bacon Is Shake-Speare, John McBride Co., New York, 1910, pp. 23, 79‚Äì80. None of these views are accepted by mainstream art historians. Lewis writes that these features are all characteristic of engravings of the era and that none are unusual. An engraving of John Davies of Hereford shares most of these quirks for example, including the uncertain placing of the head on the body and the \\"same awkward difference in design between the right and left shoulders\\".
