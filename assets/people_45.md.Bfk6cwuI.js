Prior events: Italian immigration to South Africa The flow of Italian migrants to South Africa started after the discovery of the first diamonds in 1867 and became steady at the end of the 19th century although it never reached the huge numbers of immigration to Argentina or the United States, which remained the favorite destinations of Italians seeking better living conditions abroad. Nevertheless, the Italian population in South Africa totaled roughly 5,000 people scattered between various cities. A high number, considering that Johannesburg counted 80,000 inhabitants at the time. One of the first immigrant communities was hired for the production of explosives: the Modderfontein dynamite factory was searching for skilled workers just as its equivalent in Avigliana was in financial difficulties. So, more than half of the workers and their families were transferred from Piedmont to Johannesburg, where a city section was promptly named \\"Little Italy\\" and the suburb of Orange Grove also increased its Italian population. Only a few of them accepted the harsh conditions of mining or living off the land; most were employed as stonemasons, bricklayers, artisans, cabinet makers, metal workers. In some factories such as the \\"Thomas Begbie and Son Foundry\\" three-quarters of the 200 or so workforce was Italian. Tragedy struck when a massive and abrupt explosion killed and maimed many Italians, causing a large outcry among immigrants. When the final count was done all the 12 dead were Italian and of the 56 injured 36 were Italians, the others being 10 Austrians and the rest French, German and Dutch. There were no Uitlanders. When the \\"Transvaal and Diggers\\" newspaper published the words of the State Mining Engineer, who was convinced that foul play was intended, and later added that the failed Jameson Raid had also been followed by a similar dynamite explosion, it fueled the suspicion of British or Uitlander complicity. In addition, Begbie's notorious anti-Boer stance contributed to pushing many Italians towards the Boer side. Botha was brought to trial for the factory explosion, but was later acquitted. Formation As a consequence of this, Ricchiardi created the \\"Italian Volunteer Legion\\", which was somewhat disproportionate to the numbers of the Italian community (only 200 members), but it took advantage from guerrilla tactics that its leader had learned in the Philippines. The Italians mainly saw service as Scouts, renowned for their riding and shooting skills. Others, being expert in the handling of explosives, were tasked with blowing up bridges and railway lines to hamper the British retreat from Tugela to Komatiepoort on the Mozambiquean border. They received orders not to set off charges until the British ‚Äì recognizable from their white pith helmets ‚Äì were near. On one such occasion they were so near that they were able to spot and extinguish the fuses underneath a bridge, thwarting the destruction attempt at the last second. The first successful operation planned by Camillo Ricchiardi and carried out by the Italian Legion was the capture of an armoured train near Chieveley, Natal. Among the passengers who were taken prisoners there was young journalist Winston Churchill, whose life Ricchiardi spared by pretending not to see him dumping his pistol and dum-dum ammo which had been declared unlawful and subjected to death penalty. At some point, the Italian guerrilla men began to fear for their fate: since Italy was a supporter of Britain in the war, any of them who would be captured might have been tried and executed as a traitor. Also in danger were Italian farmers with suspected Boer sympathies, and even without, who had their farms plundered by the British Army and were deported into concentration camps. Other Italian nationals had already been forcibly repatriated earlier, when their pro-Boer sympathies had become apparent. In the end, the countless efforts of the Italian Consul, Count de Morpurgo contributed to saving many Italian immigrants from ill-treatment at the hands of the British. Many more were Italian expatriates to Argentina, who joined Ricchiardi's forces after serving as horse breeders for the British since their second homeland was supplying a great many of them for the Empire's cavalry forces. Among those Italians who became well known in that war there was a Dr. Umberto Cristini who joined the Italian Scouts after leaving General de Wet's commando on the Western Front. Such was his admiration of De Wet that he asked his permission to add the General's name to his own baptised name, becoming Umberto \\"Dewet\\" Cristini. In fact at one stage it seemed he would even marry one of de Wet's daughters. He returned to the Transvaal to rejoin the war. In a letter to his mother he even mentions the fact that though everyone may have thought he went back only to fight, his other intention was to 'help find the greatest treasure anyone could imagine'. (Maybe the Kruger Millions). To this end Ricchiardi was even reported by the British Army to having been spotted in the Pretoria Station well after his departure. Cristini fought right up to the end of the war then remained in South Africa for some years ending up by training local athletes, some world famous, such as world class South African runner Jack Donaldson and marathon runner Charles Hefferon, in Cape Town. On his return to Europe became the assistant trainer of Georges Carpentier, the French world boxing-champion in 1912. A man who thrived on wars, he was implicated in the 1908 assassination of King Carlos of Portugal with a group of anarchists in an attempt to overthrow the Braganza Dynasty, which finally occurred in 1910. Arrested, he managed to escape to Spain where he spent several months. From there he moved to France where he joined the French army and was killed in action in the battle of Argonne in 1915. Another interesting character was Ciccio de Giovanni, a 12-year-old boy who made an unexpected visit to the laager of the Italian Scouts to see his father Giovanni serving in the unit. He rode all the way from Johannesburg, some 400 km, on his own. Curiously Peppino Garibaldi, Giuseppe's nephew, joined the British side and found himself fighting against and Scout Pilade Sivelli, whose father was the youngest among the \\"One Thousand Redshirts\\" who had participated in the unification of Italy. Another Italian by the name of Dr. M. Ricono, a prominent surgeon from Cape Town, offered the British his services. Of the 3,000 or so Italians who resided on the Reef just some 1,200 were left after the war.

North Presbyterian Church was added to the National Register of Historic Places February 5, 2014. Washington Heights Church =Founding= In the 1850s, Washington Heights, like the rest of upper Manhattan, was still rural. Many thoroughfares in the neighborhood, though shown on maps, were unbuilt or unopened. In March 1851, two months after the death of naturalist John James Audubon, his widow sold an entire city block out of her 24-acre farm to neighbor Dennis Harris; it was bounded by 155th and 156th Street and Tenth and Eleventh Avenue (today called Amsterdam Avenue and Broadway, respectively). Harris divided the property into lots for resale. The Washington Heights Congregational Church was established in 1855 with Harris as one of the founders.. He built a modest wooden chapel for the new congregation on a Tenth Avenue lot between 155th and 156th Street and the same year sold the congregation a lot at the northwest corner of Tenth Avenue and 155th Street for a permanent church. Construction began in 1857. John Kellum was the architect and the contractor was the local firm of Harden & Hopper. The Panic of 1857 caused economic uncertainty (which lasted until 1859), and by the end of the year, with the foundation in and the walls going up, work had to be halted for lack of money. The Rev. O. H. White, the congregation's first pastor, asked to be released, and was. On January 29, 1858, the congregation voted to join the Presbyterian denomination. It was admitted into the Second Presbytery of New York on May 23, 1859. The same year, Charles Augustus Stoddard (May 28, 1833 ‚Äì June 3, 1920) graduated from Union Theological Seminary in New York City and was assigned by the presbytery as a supply preacher for the Washington Heights Church. The congregation asked him to remain, and he was ordained pastor of the church in September 1859, beginning a tenure of 24 years. The church grew, the economic crisis waned, and construction on the new church resumed in 1860, despite the land being fully mortgaged and despite claims, judgments, and builders‚Äô liens against the unfinished structure. Smith & Cooper were the masons and David H. Doremus the carpenter. =Permanent home= Washington Heights Church The new church, one of the first houses of worship in upper Manhattan, was dedicated later that year. The building, Romanesque in style, was 85 feet long and 48 feet wide, with two brick towers, one a clock tower 120 feet high topped by a belfry enclosing a 1500-pound bell. The capacity was 600, with 88 pews of varied lengths. The sanctuary was 72 feet by 46 feet with a gallery over the vestibule. The ceilings and upper walls were frescoed, the trim was oak, and the windows were stained glass. In 1862, the church raised a volunteer choir. In February 1868, William Wheelock donated an organ and paid to add an addition to the rear of the pulpit for it. The organist was Mr. O. Oxnard. In 1859, Rev. Stoddard had married the daughter of Rev. Dr. Samuel Irenaeus Prime, proprietor and editor of the religious weekly newspaper New York Observer, and became a member of the editorial staff. In 1869, he became associate editor, and in 1873, a proprietor, at which time he offered his resignation to the church. The congregation, however, prevailed upon him to stay, agreeing to release him from some of his responsibilities, and for ten years he was both pastor and newspaper owner-editor. In 1883 he told his congregation his health would no longer allow the workload, and his resignation was accepted as of January 14 of that year. (In 1885, upon the death of Dr. Prime, he assumed the entire management of the Observer, becoming editor-in-chief and publisher until 1902, when he retired.) On June 3, 1883, Rev. Allen Ford DeCamp (February 9, 1848 ‚Äì December 27, 1928) was installed as pastor, but he was controversial and his tenure short. At a meeting of the congregation on March 13, 1885, his resignation, which had been requested, was accepted by a majority of one vote. The Rev. Dr. John Collins Bliss (May 20, 1837 ‚Äì April 11, 1909) was the next pastor, installed on October 25, 1885. He became pastor emeritus in 1905 and died in 1909. North Church on Ninth Avenue =Temporary quarters= North Church, 32nd Street In 1845 a Sunday school was opened and taught every week by Mr. Joseph B. Sheffield, assisted by other members of the Mission Association of the Mercer Street Presbyterian Church, in Ward School No. 33,(a public school) on 35th Street near 9th Avenue. The school served as a nucleus for a Christian congregation. This was a largely undeveloped area of the city. The adjacent streets had not been regulated, and the houses were few and humble. The City Mission Association of the Third and Fourth Presbyteries of New York, organized in October 1846, secured the use of the chapel of the New York Institution for the Blind, in the same area, as a preaching station for the year 1847. They appointed the Rev. Washington Roosevelt (November 14, 1802 ‚Äì February 11, 1884) as their missionary for this locality beginning January 10. A church of eight men and eight women was organized June 27, 1847, by Rev. Dr. Thomas H. Skinner (the elder, 1791‚Äì1871), pastor of the Mercer Street Church, assisted by Rev. William Adams, (b. 1813) and Rev. Roosevelt. It received the name North Presbyterian Church and was enrolled in the Third Presbytery of New York on October 4. The Sunday school in 35th Street was transferred to the new church. The congregation was chartered as a religious corporation by the New York Legislature in September 1847. A free lease of four lots of ground on the south side of 32nd Street, midway between 8th and 9th Avenue, was obtained from Mr. James Boorman for seven years, from May 1, 1848; it was subsequently extended to nine years. Plans and estimates having been procured for a temporary house of worship, the contract was given September 29, 1848, to Mr. William S. Hunt, for $2,750. It was completed in April following, at an expense of $3,200. It was a frame building, about 40 by 60 feet, with a short central tower in front. It contained 75 pews, and was furnished with a front gallery. The house was built in the open fields, on a hillside known formerly as \\"Strawberry Hill.\\" The house was opened for public worship April 13, 1849. Rev. Roosevelt was chosen the pastor and installed by the Third Presbytery May 6, 1849. He resigned the charge at the close of the year 1855, and was released by the Presbytery January 14, 1856. Rev. Edwin Francis Hatfield (January 9, 1807 ‚Äì September 22, 1883), then pastor of the Seventh Presbyterian Church of this city for 20 years, was chosen to succeed Mr. Roosevelt and was installed February 13, 1856. Measures were immediately taken to erect a permanent home. Mr. James Boorman gave the congregation free and full possession of four lots of ground, 100 feet square, on the northeast corner of 9th Avenue and 31st street, as of May 1. Robert Griffith Hatfield, brother of the pastor, was appointed the architect, and contracts were awarded for the mason-work to Mr. C. H. Tucker ($17,819) and for the carpenter-work to Mr. Hunt ($14,352). The corner-stone was laid June 19, 1856, and the lecture room opened for public worship November 16, 1856. The former house of worship was sold to the North West Presbyterian Church for $600, and soon after removed to 50th Street, near Broadway. The new church was completed and opened for public worship March 29, 1857. =Permanent home= North Church, 374 9th Avenue, in 1863 The church was Romanesque in style, of bluestone, 91 by 66 feet, with a tower projection of four feet (making the depth 95 feet). It had a slate roof with eaves 41 feet, and a ridge 62 feet, above the pavement, and a central wooden spire 182 feet high. The interior was finished in fresco and furnished with an organ from Jardine and Son. There were 152 pews on the main floor and 60 in the two side galleries with a disconnected organ gallery in front. The house was lighted at night from the ceiling. The capacity was 1,000 and the total cost, with the organ and other furniture, was $45,759.28. When completed, the undertaking had an unpaid debt of $30,000. The church prospered for a few years, but by the early 1860s, many congregants had moved away, and the society came close to bankruptcy. Rev. Hatfield resigned in October 1863, and Rev. Thomas Street became the third pastor on May 25, 1864. A great fund- raising effort was launched, and by January 22, 1871, the church was debt- free; one week later, the congregation held a celebratory service to mark the achievement. On April 14, 1873, Rev. Street resigned on account of health, and on September 21, 31-year-old Rev. Stealy Bales Rossiter (May 22, 1842 ‚Äì June 24, 1914) was installed as the fourth pastor. At the society's 25th anniversary celebration, March 26, 1882, the total membership was 700, and the total since the church's formation was 1,950. In 1897, a 50th anniversary celebration took place November 14‚Äì24, led by Pastor Rossiter. The church had recently been renovated and partly refurnished. In November 1899, Rev. Rossiter announced his resignation for January 1900 to become American Secretary in New York of the McAll Mission, which did evangelical work in France. At that time, the church had 1,000 members and a Sunday school exceeding 900 students. (In 1903, Rev. Rossiter left that position to become pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Manila, Philippine Islands.) Rev. Wilson Davidson Sexton (May 30, 1853 ‚Äì July 3, 1907) was chosen as the North Church's fifth pastor on November 14, 1900. On December 11, 1901, the President of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company publicly confirmed the company's plans to build a Hudson River tunnel, and a new passenger station in Manhattan, necessitating the displacement of many buildings, including the North Presbyterian Church. The congregation had no choice but to sell to the railroad company. The negotiation of the sale price took place over several months in 1902. Unification in new building =The merger= By 1903, Washington Heights was on the verge of urbanization. The Broadway subway line was begun in 1900. It opened for service from City Hall to 145th Street on October 27, 1904 and to 157th Street on November 5, 1904, and would extend to 242nd Street in 1908. As a direct consequence of the subway's opening, between 1905 and 1920 the population of Manhattan above 125th Street grew by 265 percent. The development of ‚Äúhigh class‚Äù elevator apartments to house the influx of new residents to Washington Heights and other neighborhoods soon followed. In March 1903, the North Church and the Washington Heights Church made plans to merge and build a new church in that neighborhood. The Presbytery of New York, governing body of the Presbyterian Church in the city, voted its preliminary approval on June 30, the combination purchased the site for the new building in December, and plans for the new church were filed with the Buildings Department in April 1904. The two congregations began worshipping together in the Fall of 1904 and in February 1905, with construction underway, the Presbytery gave formal approval and the union was finalized. The name was to be North Presbyterian Church, the pastor was to be Rev. Sexton, and Rev. Bliss would become pastor emeritus. The trustees had planned to purchase land immediately adjacent to the existing church on 155th Street, to replace it with a larger one, but could not come to terms with the landowner. In December 1903, they settled for a midblock plot 150 feet long on 155th Street, and 100 feet deep. The Washington Heights Church and the land under it were sold. It was being used to store balloons when it caught fire on March 26, 1908, and was destroyed. =The new church= North Church, 155th Street, 1905; facing east, toward altar, from balcony The new North Presbyterian Church was dedicated Sunday morning, November 5, 1905, beginning a period of dedicatory events through November 24. The church was commissioned from the architectural firm Bannister and Schell, which later designed the Harlem Savings Bank (1907, today called the Apple Bank for Savings, 124 East 125th Street) and the Holyrood Church (179th Street and Fort Washington Avenue, 1911‚Äì1914). Edwin Outwater was the builder and the superintendent of construction was Professor Collins P. Bliss, head of the engineering department of New York University, and son of the pastor emeritus. Rev. Sexton was reported to have formulated the general plan. The English Gothic design exemplifies a change in church architecture fashion at that time from Romanesque Revival to Gothic Revival. The fa√ßade, of smooth, gray brick, limestone, and terra cotta, comprises the sanctuary on the east and parish house on the west, with a 110-foot clock tower, atop the narthex, between them. The sanctuary's sloping floor has wooden pews, facing east, that curve around the main altar space. A balcony provides seating around the north, south, and west sides. The narthex and sanctuary have stained glass skylights. The capacity is 1,000 people. The three-story parish house had a Sunday school with three main rooms and eight classrooms, a library, and private offices for the school superintendent and the secretary. There was a study for the pastor, an apartment for the janitor's family, a boardroom, a kitchen, and a recreation room. Many members of the 9th Avenue church, although not all, moved with it to Washington Heights. Rev. Sexton died July 3, 1907, after two weeks' illness, age 54. The sixth pastor of North Church, Rev. John R. Mackay, was installed March 17, 1908. The congregation grew from 664 in 1906 to 1,471 by 1918. In the 1920s, the church had the fourth largest congregation in the Presbytery of New York City. In 1923 a community center, with a gymnasium, a swimming pool, classrooms, and a kitchen, was built adjacent to the parish house to its west. The two-story building, designed by architect Eli Benedict, a member of the church, was called Memorial House to commemorate the men who died in World War I. Early in 1926, Rev. Mackay submitted his resignation, effective December 6, after which the pulpit was filled by Rev. Dr. Arthur J. Smith, for many years secretary of the Evangelistic Committee of New York City, for seven weeks. Harlem congregation =Lenox Church= Lenox Presbyterian Church, 1893; today it is Grace Congregational Church On September 21, 1890, the Rev. A. W. Halsey and William M. Waite opened a Sunday school at 2566 8th Avenue, near 137th Street in Harlem. There were only 24 persons present, and they organized the Lenox Presbyterian Sunday School Association. On Nov. 2, Sunday evening services were begun there, and a little later a Christian Endeavor Society was formed. Then a girls' sewing school and afterward a boys' club were started. On February 27, 1891, the society moved to larger quarters at 2553 8th Avenue. The Rev. Dr. Edward L. Clark (February 3, 1838 ‚Äì February 5, 1910), pastor of the Church of the Puritans, took an interest in the young congregation, and when it was known that it was in need of a pastor, he volunteered to guarantee a salary for one. On April 12, 1891, David Garrett Smith (ordained 1892) was engaged to perform the pastoral work of the congregation, which he did for more than a year. On December 28, 1891, with the approval of the New York Presbytery, the Lenox Presbyterian Church was established, with 37 members. At the same time the congregation was incorporated under the laws of New York, and officers were elected. On January 7, 1892, the trustees of the Church Extension Committee signed a contract to purchase a plot of ground, 140 feet by 100 feet, and the Sunday School Committee of the Presbytery had plans drawn up for a modest midblock church at 308‚Äì310 West 139th Street, between 8th Avenue (today called Frederick Douglass Boulevard) and Edgecombe Avenue. The cornerstone was laid September 24, 1892. The church was dedicated January 8, 1893, by which time it had 60 members. Rev. Dr. Francis Henry Marling officiated at the morning service, Rev. Dr. James H. Hoadley addressed the Sunday school in the afternoon, and Rev. Dr. John Hall gave a sermon at the evening service. The dedication ceremonies continued the next evening. Designed by architect Joseph Ireland (b. June 17, 1843) in Romanesque style, the church ‚Äì initially called a chapel and seen as a temporary home ‚Äì had a capacity of about 400, an elevation of 45 feet, and a plan 35 by 90 feet. It is made of Ohio brick with brownstone trim and has a Georgia pine interior, galleries for choir and congregation, and facilities for a Sunday school. After a number of ministers were tried, Rev. Bryce K. Douglas, a favorite with the young people, was unanimously elected pastor at a meeting of the members on February 4. He accepted the call and took up his duties April 1, 1893, but he resigned amid controversy after only a year. The second pastor was Rev. Thomas William Smith, installed December 20, 1894, who served 20 years. In 1902, the congregation purchased land nearby, on the northwest corner of St. Nicholas Avenue and 141st Street, for a new church, having outgrown the existing one. Over the summer of 1904, plans were filed with the Buildings Department for a church to be built on the new plot. The cornerstone for the new edifice was laid on October 15, 1904. By then, church membership exceeded 500, and the Sunday school had 600 students. In early 1904, the 139th Street church was sold. It was later purchased by the Swedish Immanuel Congregational Church, which began services there in March 1905, gave it a thorough renovation a few months later, and installed a new organ in 1909. In 1923 the church was acquired by the Grace Congregational Church of Harlem, which continues to reside there. =St. Nicholas Avenue Church= St. Nicholas Avenue Church, c. 1910; since 1927 it has been St. James Presbyterian Church The dedication of the new St. Nicholas Avenue Church took place on January 21, 1906. Architect Ludlow & Valentine gave the Gothic-style church a square bell tower, light yellow Roman brick, and Indiana limestone trim. The auditorium was given large Gothic windows in the side walls and some 24 clerestory windows. It was trimmed in brown oak and the ceiling showed open truss work. Including galleries, the capacity was about 800. In addition to the usual rooms for the pastor, choir, and session, the building included a kitchen, a library, and a large social room at the level of the first floor. Philip L. Schenk was selected as organist for the new church. On May 1, 1907, William Jennings Bryan, a college classmate of Rev. Smith, the pastor, delivered his famous Chautauqua lecture, \\"The Prince of Peace\\". The townhouse at 58 Hamilton Terrace, near the church, was purchased as a parsonage in 1913. On December 5, 1914, it was reported that Rev. Smith had left the St. Nicholas Avenue Church for Orange, N. J. Rev. Dr. Elliott Wilber Brown came to the church in January as the temporary supply and in March accepted the congregation's call to become its pastor. He was installed on March 25, 1915. In 1926 North Church and the St. Nicholas Avenue Church held union services for the summer months, so that one clergyman could serve two churches. (Similar arrangements were made by other churches in the city). By then, population and demographic change within the neighborhood had been substantial. The following year, the two congregations merged at 155th Street, under the North Church name. The last services at St. Nicholas Avenue Church were held January 23, 1927. The St. Nicholas Avenue Church was transferred to the congregation of St. James Colored Presbyterian Church, of 59‚Äì61 West 137th Street, which was descended from one of the earliest black congregations in New York. They made a gala parade from their old home to their new one on Sunday, June 5, 1927, before the opening service. The sermon for the service was preached by Rev. Dr. Harlan G. Mendenhall, Stated Clerk of the New York Presbytery, and Rev. William Lloyd Imes, the pastor of St. James, preached the children's sermon. The congregation, today called St. James Presbyterian Church, continues to make its home there today. Second unification The first service of the united congregation, whose pastor was Rev. Henry Burnham Kirkland of the St. Nicholas Avenue Church, took place in the North Church on 155th Street January 30, 1927. As a result of the merger with St. Nicholas Avenue, the North Presbyterian Church became the third largest Church in the Presbytery. A 1935 roll included over 950 members. On September 25, 1932, Rev. Kirkland handed in his resignation, effective January 1, reportedly because differences of opinion between groups representing each of the two churches over administrative matters had been more or less constant since the merger. Rev. Dr. Merle H. Anderson, 60, was installed as pastor December 6, 1933. Eventually the congregation fell into decline due to the changing demographics and development of the neighborhood. Many members moved to newer suburbs and the congregation shrank. In 1957, it reached a low of 267 members. The neighborhood, and the congregation, experienced some growth in the 1960s and 1970s as more African Americans began to move to the area and in the 1980s with the move of Dominicans to the neighborhood. But in 2013, it had only 22 members, according to Presbyterian Mission Agency Research Services. The church underwent a restoration in the early 2000s to repair roof and water damage and restore main public spaces, including the lecture hall and social hall. Mawuhle Presbyterian Church, a fellowship within the Presbytery of New York City whose members are mostly from Ghana, also calls the building home, worshiping in its sanctuary on Sunday afternoons.

Scomi Group Bhd is listed on the main board of Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad, and its group of companies are involved in oilfield services, public transportation and marine services. The group offers drilling fluids (DF) and related engineering services, drilling waste management (DWM) solutions, distribution of oilfield products and services, marine vessel services, machine shop services, transport engineering products involving special purpose vehicles, rail wagons, monorail vehicles and buses, supply of industrial and production chemicals and carbon dioxide (CO2) separation. The group was founded in 1961 and operates across 48 locations in 22 countries.  Activities  The company provides oilfield drilling fluids and drilling waste management services and also supplies monorail projects through its Scomi Rail subsidiary. Other companies under Scomi Group listed on Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad are Scomi Marine Berhad and Scomi Engineering Berhad. Other companies in the Scomi group include Scomi Oilfield Limited (Bermuda), Scomi Oiltools Limited (Bermuda), Scomi Capital Limited (Labuan), Scomi International Private Limited (Singapore), Scomi Ecosolve Limited (British Virgin Islands). The company's subsidiaries and associate companies are involved in: * oilfield Services, which comprises integrated drilling fluids and drilling waste management solutions; OCTG machine shops and distribution of oilfield products and services * transport, which comprises rail, monorail and buses for the transportation sector and special purpose vehicles for the aviation, health, defense, commercial and rescue services *energy logistics, which provides marine vessels for the coal and oil and gas industry *production enhancement, which comprises industrial and production chemicals division; and gas business, which mainly provides gas processing equipment. History The Scomi Group has its roots in Subang Commercial Motor Industries (S.C.O.M.I.) incorporated in 1990. In 2000, Scomi was acquired by Kaspadu Sdn Bhd a company controlled by Shah Hakim Zain and Kamaluddin Abdullah. When the founders of the company took over Subang Commercial Motor Industries, the main motivation for the acquisition was the coach building business. Eventually, the drilling fluids business became the main business for the group, which led to its listing on the then second board of Bursa Malaysia. In 2004, it bought a 71% stake in Oiltools International Ltd to expand its oil and gas business. Not long after that it took over jewellery company Habib Corp Bhd, which would later become Scomi Marine, and it entered into a RM1.3bil deal to buy vessels from Chuan Hup and stakes in CH Offshore Ltd and PT Rig Tenders Indonesia. The company moved its engineering division into the listed shell corporation of Bell & Order Bhd, which later became Scomi Engineering in 2006. In 2007, Scomi Engineering bought Mtrans, a bus and monorail operator, for RM25mil. Scomi's major shareholder is Datuk Kamaluddin Abdullah, son of former prime minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. Monorail projects Monorails form an area of increased focus for Scomi, as the company seeks to diversify its business lines. Scomi Engineering won a RM1.84 billion bid in 2008 to build a monorail project in Mumbai with its Indian partner Larsen & Toubro. Its share of that job is RM823mil and projected margins are between 10% and 20%. The Mumbai project has been a failure with the operations stopped in November 2017, due to an incidental fire in two coaches. On 14 December, MMRDA took over Monorail operations after terminating the contract with LTSE. Scomi is one of only two companies in the world providing integrated monorail solutions, and this has led to it garnering business in India, in Mumbai and Bengaluru (Bangalore). Monorail projects involving Scomi: * KL Monorail Developed by Scomi Transport Systems * Jakarta Monorail (cancel) * Putrajaya Monorail (work suspended) * Mumbai Monorail (Opened in February 2014, work began in January 2009) * S√£o Paulo Metro Line 17 Gold, in Brazil, connecting inner city Congonhas airport to several conventional rail metro lines and the district of Morumbi * Manaus Monorail, in Brazil * Proposal accepted by Karnataka Govt for Bengaluru monorail, currently headed for Swiss Challenge system  Research Typically, monorails carry fewer passengers than a LRT or MRT. Following research and development, Scomi announced a monorail with an eight-car configuration, versus the current four-car configuration for the monorail in Mumbai. This monorail can carry 1,000 passengers, the same as a six-car LRT. Scomi Engineering ploughs back some 20% of its revenue into research and development on trains. The next-generation monorails it is building is called Gen 3.0 and would be the size of a LRT wagon. It is also evaluating the prospect of going into trains, where it can build LRTs or EMU (electrical multiple units), which is the kind of trains KTM uses for commuter service. Awards The company was awarded the GreenTech Environment Excellence Silver Award 2009, by New Delhi's GreenTech Foundation. Scomi was declared the winner of the award under the engineering sector for raw materials consumption and products manufactured for buses and coaches which contributed to the protection of the environment and surrounding community. Scomi won the Industry Excellence Award 2008 given by the Malaysian Ministry of International Trade and Industry for its performance in exports. Controversies In the past, Scomi has faced US sanctions imposed on CEO Shah Hakim Zain. These sanctions arose following allegations of Scomi being part of an international nuclear proliferation programme masterminded by Pakistan's Abdul Qadeer Khan. The Malaysian police announced that one of Scomi's main backers, Buhary Syed Abu Tahir, confessed to helping Dr Khan sell nuclear secrets and supplies to Iran and Libya. Tahir, a Sri Lankan national, is reported to have links with international crime boss Dawood Ibrahim. Tahir was detained without trial from 2006 to 2008 for allegedly being a national security risk, having been accused of fraudulently convincing a Scomi subsidiary company to produce components for centrifuges to be used in a uranium enrichment program. Scomi has insisted that B.S.A. Tahir had misled it to believe that the parts were for the oil and gas industry. However, B.S.A. Tahir is reported to have said that Scomi's CEO, Shah Hakim Zain, and Scomi's main backer, Kamaluddin Abdullah (son of then Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi), both knew the final destination of the products. He has accused Scomi of making fraudulent declarations and in 2009 he sued Shah Hakim and Kamaluddin for MYR75 million. The Inspector General of Police in Malaysia investigated these allegations in depth, and concluded that in his report that: \\"The management of SCOPE were unaware that the exported components were part of certain centrifuge unit for LIBYA. The management of SCOPE considered it a legitimate business deal. To untrained eyes, such components would not raise any concern, as the components are similar to components that could be used by the 'petrol -chemical industry' and 'water treatment' and various other industries.\\" Investigators also found that \\"SCOPE obtained the semi-finished product to produce the said components from a German company Bikar Metal and this gives the impression that these items are not controlled items. In view of the foregoing, the work that was carried out on the semi-finished product is legitimate and does not give rise to suspicion.\\" (Quotes are from Police report).

The 'Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken' group in Germany is not associated with the 'Volksbank' institutes (people's bank) in other countries, like the Volksbank group headquartered in Austria.

The film follows the lives of four adolescents in and around the blue-collar Melbourne suburb of Altona. Synopsis Joe (Aden Young) lives with his mentally-ill father (Petru Gheorghiu) in working-class Altona, suburban Melbourne. A shy misfit whose great love is hotted-up cars, Joe gets a job at the supermarket where he is befriended by fellow revhead Dazey (Ben Mendelsohn), a confident womaniser at the crossroads with his girlfriend, Roslyn (Nadine Garner). Savina (Tara Morice), a devil worshipper who works with Joe, feigns interest in him to get closer to Dazey. When Joe discovers Savina's deceit he embarks on a violent and tragic rampage. Reception Despite generally positive reviews and selection in the 1994 Venice Film Festival, Metal Skin proved a disappointment at the Australian box office when it was released on 4 May 1995 where it grossed $883,521. Australian critic Andrew Howe praised it as \\"a dark, arresting ode to suburban hopelessness\\" however Todd McCarthy writing in Variety described the film as \\"so overwrought and unrelievedly grim that it comes close to playing like a parody of teenage angst movies.\\" =Awards= It won AFI Awards in 1995 for Best Production Design (Steven Jones‚ÄìEvans) and Best Sound (Frank Lipson, David Lee, Steve Burgess, Peter Burgess, Glenn Newnham) and received nominations for Best Actor (Aden Young), Supporting Actor (Ben Mendelsohn), Supporting Actress (Nadine Garner) and Costume Design (Anna Borghesi). Aden Young and Ben Mendelsohn shared the Film Critics Circle of Australia prize for Best Actor. Novelisation The novelisation of Metal Skin was written by Jocelyn Harewood and published by Text Publishing in 1995. Harewood follows the film closely however the book explores other sides of the characters: Joe's inner rage at his brain-damaged father and his love for what his father has been; Savina's destructive witchcraft; Dazey's moments of self- awareness and higher motives. It was published as an e-book in November 2012 and made available on Harewood's website.

It runs from J√ºterbog via Falkenberg (Elster) to R√∂derau, near Riesa. There it ends in a triangular junction with the Leipzig‚ÄìDresden railway, connecting to Riesa and Dresden. The J√ºterbog‚ÄìFalkenberg section consists of a single track; the Falkenberg‚ÄìRiesa section has two tracks. It was opened in 1848 and is one of the oldest lines in Germany. History  =Planning and Construction = The Berlin-Anhalt Railway Company (, BAE) was one of the major railway companies in Germany for more than four decades during the 19th century. One of its major objects was to connect Berlin and Dresden. The first section of the Anhalt trunk line was opened on 1 July 1841 from Berlin to J√ºterbog. After several delays, the J√ºterbog‚ÄìR√∂derau line opened in two stages in 1848. On 2 July, the line from J√ºterbog to Herzberg was opened and on 1 October it was extended to R√∂derau, where it connected with the Leipzig-Dresden main line. In 1871, the Halle‚ÄìCottbus line of the Halle-Sorau-Guben Railway (Halle-Sorau-Gubener Eisenbahn) was opened over the J√ºterbog‚ÄìR√∂derau line in Falkenberg. A two- level station was built at the junction. =Operations = The line was used mainly for transport between Berlin and Dresden. In 1875, the competing direct Berlin‚ÄìDresden line of the Berlin-Dresden Railway Company (Berlin-Dresdener Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) was opened between the two cities. This line, which ran via Elsterwerda, was about twelve kilometres shorter. At the end of the World War II long-distance traffic was shared between both routes. Most trains running via R√∂derau divided at Falkenberg, with one section continuing to Chemnitz and the other to Dresden. After the division of Berlin, long distance trains no longer ran to Anhalt station, but instead ran on the Berlin outer ring to eastern Berlin. The Anhalt route involved a greater detour for trains to and from Dresden; as a result all trains between Berlin and Dresden ran via Elsterwerda. Some express trains continued to run via Falkenberg to Chemnitz (renamed Karl-Marx-Stadt in 1953). Express trains were diverted to the Riesa‚ÄìElsterwerda line in the early 1970s and the line via Falkenberg was served only by freight and regional passenger services. The only prestige service on the line was an express train on the Dresden‚ÄìFalkenberg‚ÄìDessau route (later running on to K√∂then) and return, running on Fridays and Sundays. After the fall of Communism, services improved on the northern section between J√ºterbog and Falkenberg, which connected to Berlin. The trains were given a minimum of investment and connected directly to Berlin. In contrast, traffic on the southern sector to Riesa steadily declined. In December 2004, passenger services on this section were cancelled by the Upper Elbe Transport Association. Current situation  The J√ºterbog‚ÄìFalkenberg section is now served every two hours by Regional-Express trains as line RE5, connecting to Berlin. There are now no scheduled passenger trains on the southern sector, only freight trains.

It was established in 1958. The museum contains artifacts unearthed nearby from the ancient Greek town of Apollonia and is close to the Ardenica Monastery. History The first attempts to conduct excavations in Apollonia were made during World War I by Austrian archaeologists who unearthed and explored mainly the walls that encircled the city. Systematic excavations began in 1924 by a French archaeological mission directed by Leon Rey, who brought to light a complex of monuments at the center of the city. During the late 1920s and 1930s, Rey pressed for an archaeological museum to house the artifacts his team uncovered but lack of finance prolonged it. Finally on October 8, 1936 the collection of archaeological finds at Apollonia were exhibited in the government building in Vlor√´, which suffered bombardment and looting during World War II. After the war, further archeological finds saw another campaign for a public museum, but in the Apollonia area. The archaeologists S. Anamali and H. Ceka successfully raised the finances needed to open a museum and finally it opened in 1958, in the village of Pojan, within the ancient site. During the communist period was a considerable success. A lot of excavations made by Albanian archaeologists during a 40-year period were exhibited in the museum. However, in 1991 it was looted and closed. Today 07/12/2011 the Archaeological Museum of Apollonia National Park has reopened the doors after 20 years. 688 important objects, and the large number of ancient coins make it among the richest museums in the country. The project of restoration of the archaeological museum has launched 3 years ago with a fund of 140 thousand dollars, UNESCO funding. Museum with 1 thousand square meters area, was closed in the early 90s due to the depreciation of the building. Archaeological objects since that time are stored in the Institute of monuments in the capital. While the porch was suffered after slipping crack that land still continues to be damaged. Collection The museum is housed in a 14th-century building which was previously the monastery of St. Mary. It is accessed via a double wooden door and a grand entrance on the west side. The museum has 7 pavilions, a gallery and 2 porticos. The bulk of the collection is housed in 6 rooms on the ground floor to the north and west of the complex. An impressive collection of statues is located in a portico on the east side and number of historically important frescoes remain in the building from medieval times; these are mainly housed in the refectory. Fragments of inscriptions and other spolia can be found on the walls and the museum also has a collection of medieval mosaics.

The first three are Jan-Ove Waldner (in 1992), Liu Guoliang (in 1999), and Kong Linghui (in 2000). Zhang won the Grand Slam in only 445 days. He won, consecutively, first WTTC 2011, then World Cup 2011, and then London Olympics 2012, which made him the fastest player ever to win a Grand Slam.

After a few months, he won the 2011 World Cup in Paris by defeating Joo-Sae Hyuk 4‚Äì1, Wang Hao 4‚Äì2 in the final. After the final point, he took off his shirt and threw it to the audience and thanked them for their support. During the Olympic Games in London 2012, Zhang played a terrific match against European legend Vladimir Samsonov where he was 2-3 down, but still managed to win the match. In the semi-final, he defeated Dimitrij Ovtcharov 4‚Äì1. In the final he met his teammate Wang Hao again. But this time Zhang proved he was too strong and dominated Wang Hao. By defeating Wang Hao, he achieved a career Grand Slam. Zhang Jike also won the Gold Medal in the team event but on the way lost to Timo Boll in the semi-final against Germany. Later that year he won against Ma Long 4‚Äì3 in final of the Slovakia Open. In 2013, he had a bad start after losing to Chen-Chien-An at the Asian Games. Later at the WTTC, he once again proved he was undefeatable. He won the Gold Medal beating Fan Zhendong, Robert Gardos, Gustavo Tsuboi, Patrick Baum, Xu Xin and Wang Hao in the finals. This time Zhang jumped over the barriers and ran towards his parents. The same year, he defeated Ma Long 4‚Äì1 in the final of the Kuwait Open. In 2014 he won the World Cup in D√ºsseldorf/ Germany by defeating Timo Boll in the semi-final and Ma Long in the final by 4‚Äì3.

In the final he lost to his teammate Ma Long 0‚Äì4. In 2017 at the Asian Championships Zhang defeated Yuya Oshima and Lin Gaoyuan before taking the Bronze Medal. At the WTTC in D√ºsseldorf/ Germany, Zhang lost to Lee Sangsu of South-Korea 1‚Äì4. He could not play to his full potential as only the previous month he was under treatment for a hip injury. Next month in the China Open, he conceded his match versus Masaki Yoshida as he was again suffering from a hip injury. After 5 months being absent, Zhang appeared on the World Tour again. He participated in the German Open but lost to Tiago Apolonia 1‚Äì4. His world ranking dropped to 176 due to his absence from the World Tour. 6 months later he participated on the 2018 World Tour again. He first lost to Maharu Yoshimura, 3‚Äì4 in the Hong Kong Open as it was his first match after a long break from competitive play. Later that year at the China Open, he easily defeated Aruna Quadri but couldn't survive the speed of Tomokazu Harimoto. At the Japan Open, he was back in form again and defeated Lin-yu-Jun, Jonathan Groth, Liang Jiangkun and Jin Ueda. But unfortunately he injured his back while playing against Harimoto in the final and lost 3‚Äì4 in a narrow match. His ranking however increased to number 71 in just one month. Two months later at the Asia-Euro Championships he defeated Bastian Steger and Jonathan Groth and proved he is still in form. Equipment and playing style Zhang Jike is a Butterfly sponsored athlete. He uses Butterfly Viscaria for his blade, a Butterfly Tenergy 80 (red) on his backhand, and DHS Hurricane 3 neo National blue sponge (black) on his forehand. Zhang Jike is a two-winged shakehand attacker, using a combination of quick topspin drive attacks, counters, and loops. He is using the harder blue sponge H3 Neo for maximum drive. He stays very low to the ground and is exceptionally quick on his feet. Among all the Chinese National team players, he is known for having the best backhand technique, often using it in the forehand corner, especially when returning heavy under-spin serves and pushes. His backhand on-the-table flick is widely regarded as one of the best in the world. When Zhang Jike initially joined the national team, the coaches were apprehensive about his forehand technique and thought about changing it completely. But Xiao Zhan, the then personal coach of Zhang Jike, noticed the explosive technique of his forehand and backhand strokes and instead retained them. Zhang Jike's spin oriented technique provides him oftentimes with a topspin advantage against opponents. Zhang's serves are unpredictable and quite deceptive. His most famous serve is probably the reverse-pendulum short serve into both corners of the table. The side-spin on the serve, together with his backhand flicks, above-average footwork and top-class anticipation has proved to be an ideal combination as he is capable to \\"open up\\" topspin rallies to his advantage. It is noticeable that he would play with a backhand oriented game plan against big forehand loopers like Ma Long or Fan Zhendong. He would keep his opponents in their backhand corner and go for down-the-line blocking winners as the opposition steps around to use a forehand loop, or just pile up pressure, resulting in bad shot selections and unforced errors by the opponent. One of Zhang Jike's most valuable asset is his mental strength. His ability to win big points in major competitions under pressure is apparent to observers. In 2014, Zhang's world ranking dropped to 5th as a result of consecutive early world tour exits and title drought. Head coach Liu Guoliang criticized him for his lack of focus and techniques development.

He was known as Vancouver's bicycle poet.bicycle poet Life Gilbert was a multimedia artist who worked comfortably as writer, film-maker, photographer, performance artist and more. He was born in 1936 during a trip between Toronto and Vancouver forcing his parents to stop briefly in Calgary. His art reflects this unique birth as much of its allure is a kind of tension between remaining and continuing. He attended the University of British Columbia (1954‚Äì56) before traveling to England and further study there. Gilbert then returned to Vancouver and although he died there he managed to live and travel across Canada and Europe in his younger years. Gerry became a well known local fixture in the Vancouver art scene and began a periodical anthology of writing that he distributed himself called the British Columbia Monthly (later becoming simply B.C. Monthly) in 1972 placing him among the ranks of Canadian artists participating in the mimeograph revolution. To some he was known as 'the Jude the Obscure of Vancouver poetry'. Gerry hosted a radio show for many years on CFRO-FM Radio called radiofreerainforest. Gilbert's film and photography have been exhibited by the Vancouver Art Gallery, the Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery, the Western Front, and the Contemporary Art Gallery (Vancouver). He was a prolific writer whose work spanned from the early sixties into the beginnings of the 21st century. His largest and most comprehensive work is Moby Jane published by Toronto's Coach House Books in 1987.

He was a professor from 1856 to 1893. In his later period he belonged to the Dutch radical critics. Life Loman was the son of a minister in the Dutch Lutheran church. He started studying theology in 1840 and became a minister in 1846. In 1856 he became a professor at the Lutheran seminary in Amsterdam. Loman gradually lost his eyesight in the beginning of the 1870s, but continued working. From 1877 he also was a theology professor at the University of Amsterdam until his retirement in 1893. Work Loman introduced modern theology in the Dutch Lutheran Church. He taught almost all disciplines of theology, but concentrated after 1867 on the New Testament and early Christian literature. He wrote a book about the Muratorian fragment, but published mostly in journals. His opinions mostly agreed with the T√ºbingen school. When his colleague Allard Pierson in 1878 denied the authenticity of Galatians, Loman wrote a fierce condemnation. But after 1880 his views changed. He was an advocate of the Christ myth theory and caused great consternation by a public lecture on 13 December 1881 in the building of the Vrije Gemeente where he stated that Jesus is not a figure of history and that all we know about him is second-century fiction. In his Quaestiones Paulinae (1882, 1883, 1886) he abandoned Pauline authorship of Galatians. His arguments were that the Pauline epistles are not quoted by Justin Martyr and that the first datable references are by Marcion.

Meetings On 20 June 1966, the first meeting to establish a Queensland Council for Civil Liberties was held. This meeting was disrupted by groups of left and right wing political persuasions who disagreed on how to achieve the major objectives of the CouncilClarke, Eddie.

A second meeting was held on 19 August 1966, but again this meeting was infiltrated by the right wing organisation The Catholic Action Group who aimed to prevent the Council obtaining a left-wing orientation. At this meeting the group dominated the newly formed council with conservative views and altered the name of this newly evolving civil liberties group to 'The Queensland Association for Civil Liberties.' Due to this takeover, many members withdrew and The Queensland Association for Civil Liberties once again changed its name, this time to the Ombudsman Association of Queensland. A third attempt to create a Queensland Council for Civil Liberties, free of political or sectarian influence, was made at a private meeting on 19 October 1966. The development of this group succeeded and the group received recognition from both the New South Wales and Victorian Council for Civil Liberty groups.

Meanwhile, the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties work to facilitate safe and productive striking practiceMurphy, D.J. The Big Strikes. St Lucia:University of Queensland Press, 1983. Print In 1912, the right to strike was essentially quashed by a conservative Queensland government, led by Digby Denham, who passed the 1912 Industrial Peace Act in Queensland, which was an Act imposing penalties on strikers. Following this first instance of the government retaliating to strikers and subsequent strikes, The State Transport Act 1938 and The Industrial Law Amendment Act 1948 extended the power of the police to use force and arrest citizens without a warrant, effectively reducing protests and strike action. The Industrial Law Amendment Act The 1948 Queensland Railway strike was a strike lasting nine weeks,from February to April 1948, and concerned the wages of Railway and Locomotive workers in Queensland. It was prompted by a low-wage policy introduced by the Halon Labor Government.Baker, David. \\"Barricade and Batons: an historical perspective of the policing or major industrial disorder in Australia.\\" History of Crime, Policing and Punishment Conference.

Police powers were extended, and through the initiation of these acts they were given the power to arrest citizens without a warrant and use force where necessary. Severe police brutality occurred during an illegal march on Saint Patrick's Day, 19 March 1948, when strikers were arrested, several demonstrators were hospitalised and union offices were raided. Eventually, wage increases were granted and emergency powers were revoked.

Additionally the board was able to ban future issues of a publication regardless of whether the literature had been examined or not, however bans could be lifted if the board felt the publication had been 'reconstructed'.From the establishment of the Literature Board of Review in 1954 til 1981, 607 banning orders were made in Queensland with only six being disputed before the Supreme Court. Civil Rights Action Committee and QCCL In June 1966, the Civil Rights Action Committee (CRAC) was established to seek reforms to the traffic regulations yet the Government rejected their submissions. The QCCL actively support the efforts of the CRAC. The University of Queensland Students' Union had also criticised the use of traffic legislation and the use of unnecessary police violence during the arrests of peaceful demonstrators. Furthermore, in early 1967, the Civil Liberties Co- ordination Committee (CLCC) and Students for Democratic Action, both based on the University of Queensland campus, had formed to oppose the restrictions of civil liberties. The CLCC planned a protest march without a permit from the University to the city on 11 July 1967, but a mass meeting of students voted to postpone this until 5 September 1967 to give time for negotiations with the Queensland Government. On 7 August, Frank Gardiner, a moderate president of the Students' Union and later a vice-president of the QCCL, presented to Queensland Premier George Nicklin a submission to reform provisions of the Traffic Act and Council President Kelly and Council Secretary Lindsay Smith took part in preparing this submission. Cabinet made a few limited concessions but they would not concede any changes to the major point of discontent ‚Äì that police could refuse permits without reason. This heightened the suspicions of civil liberties advocates that the police, acting as agents of the Government, could discriminate against groups espousing unpopular causes. \\"A deeply conservative State Government, under Queensland Premiers Frank Nicklin and later Joh Bjelke-Petersen, was determined to show protestors \\"who was boss\\".

The march was obstructed by the police before it arrived at the destination and consequently they staged a mass sit-down protest in Roma St, causing 144 arrests. \\"The 1967 Civil Liberties March was a turning point in student and State politics, subsequently leading to mass protests against the Vietnam War and the success of the emerging student movement in the decade to follow.

The Council aimed to be both non-political, non-sectarian and neither anti-police nor anti-government. Although QCCL is open to anyone, members must \\"subscribe to the aims of the Council of safeguarding any liberties remaining from any infringement by police of political action\\"UQ Fryer Library, Box 2. Over the years, the Council has faced difficulty recruiting members and has often held low membership rates. When the council first began in 1966 there was low support from University lecturers and lawyers, as people may have felt their jobs may be jeopardised for affiliating with the Council and becoming members. Communication After the Council was formed on 19 October 1966, led by President Jim Kelly, the Council began establishing itself as an important civil liberties group in Queensland. They began producing information to be distributed to citizens that would inform them of their civil rights and consequently when the government made changes that impinged on citizens rights,the Council held them accountable.The QCCL has used newsletters as a form of communication between members.Due to the low membership rates, newsletter distribution over the years has been sporadic. In 1967 the Council released its first booklet containing information that would assist citizens in their dealings with the Police. Entitled The Citizen and the Police, it contained subsections such as Types of Arrest,After Arrest, Bail and Proceedings in Court.This is just one example of the work the Council performed at a time when their assistance was greatly required. An updated version of this booklet under the same title was also released in 1982 by the QCCL.Geraghty, J.M. The Citizen and the Police: A Publication of the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties. Brisbane: Queensland Council for Civil Liberties.1982. Print The Right to Demonstrate Upon deploying troops to Vietnam, anti-conscription demonstrations were held throughout Australia and such demonstrations of opinion were new to Queensland at this time. Queensland was the only State where police arrests were made, following the laws set out in the Traffic Act. A group who fought for civil rights prior to the formation of the QCCL was The Queensland Civil Liberties League,who were active in supporting a campaign to vote no to banning the Communist Party in Australia. In 1968, one of the first moves by the Council to support freedom of speech in Queensland, was when council president Jim Kelly supported Brisbane's first Nationalist Socialist Party meeting. He was published in The Australian stating 'the Council supported the principle of freedom of speech even for repugnant doctrines such as the Nazi Party'.Fryer, Box 2 In 1981, the Coalition State government produced a Queen Street Mall Bill which increased police powers. Brisbane's Queen Street Mall featured heavily in the Council's activity for many years after. Subsequent amendments to the Bill and the passing of the Local Government (Queen Street Mall) Act Amendment Act prohibited Queen Street Mall visitors from 'preaching, haranguing, singing, chanting, miming, recitals or other entertainments' unless a permit had been obtained from the Brisbane City Council. The Council continued to fight these restrictions and supported activists in their plights to allow freedom of speech in the Queen Street Mall. In a move that proved the Council's success, a Brisbane City Council representative,David Hinchliffe, opened a Speakers' Corner in King George Square.Anon. \\"Democracy is choking on Humbug.\\" Gold Coast Bulletin 20 May. 2008 Aboriginal Australians and Citizenship ‚Äì The Mabo Legislation Aboriginal Land Right Protest For many years, Aboriginal Australians and their supporters fought for civil rights and legal equality without the help of the QCCL. Upon forming, the QCCL worked with Aboriginal welfare organisations to inform Aboriginals of their rights if arrested. In 1967, the Council supported the campaign to secure an affirmative vote in the Commonwealth referendum on the welfare of Aborigines. The 1967 referendum is historically noted as the 'citizenship maker' and the 1960s decade saw the Commonwealth and State Government abandon citizenship restrictions.Chesterman, John. Civil Rights: How Indigenous Australians Won Formal Equality. St Lucia: University of Queensland, 2005. The 1967 referendum awarded Aboriginal Australians full citizenship rights and the Federal Government a mandate over Aboriginal affairs (Daniels, 11). This vote also meant Aboriginals were granted the right to be included in population statistics. Since the establishment of the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties, Australian state parliaments showed little interest in awarding Aboriginal Australians the right to land and Aboriginal Land rights were a topic of much criticism for the Queensland State Government. Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen ruled that in 1982, Aboriginal Australians would only receive 'deeds of grant in trust' over reserve land. Bjelke-Petersen claimed that the Aboriginal land rights movement was little more than a plot to create a separate black nation in Australia. =Campaigns and activities: 1968‚Äì1976= This was a time of great change in the fight for civil rights in Queensland. A new Premier, Joh Bjelke-Petersen, was sworn in during this time and many protests took place questioning this governments policies on civil liberties. Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen with Russ Hinze Joh Bjelke-Petersen Joh Bjelke-Petersen was elected the Premier of Queensland from 1968 until 1987. The QCCL was constantly involved with this government due to their repeated breaches of civil liberties. A substantial reason the council was created was to quell police misconduct and corruption and shortly after their formation, Bjelke-Petersen began what was concurrently described as a \\"corrupt and vicious regime.Police were accused of intimidatory tactics, brutality, and essentially of forming a police state in Queensland acting virtually as a private army for the regime.\\" In 1969 Bjelke-Petersen's censorship campaign extended from written publication into the theatre and prosecution began for utterances as well as written prose. As a result, Brisbane actor Norman Staines was arrested for the use of an obscene phrase during his one act performance of the play Norm and Ahmed. Staines was arrested by police, locked up and charged with using an obscene expression under The Vagrants, Gaming and Other Offences Act 1931‚Äì67, as a result almost every theatre company in Brisbane attacked the existing censorship system. This led to the promoter of the musical Hair refusing to bring the show to Brisbane theaters, in response cabinet member Russ Hinze condemned Hair as being appealing to only the 'sexually-depraved, or a group of homosexuals, lesbians, wifeswappers and spivs.' The Springbok Tour The Springbok Tour Demonstration, 1971 In July 1971, an Australian Rugby team the Wallabies played a test game against the Springboks, a white South African team.Springbok Tour.

(http://www.abc.net.au/tv/rewind/txt/s1204845.html) This was at a time of growing international opposition to South Africa's racist apartheid policies, and The Springbok's visit allowed the Queensland Premier, Bjelke-Petersen, to declare a state of emergency for a month.Bryce, Alex. \\"We Would Live in Peace and Tranquility and No One Would Know Anything.\\" Australian Academic and Research Libraries 31.3(2000): 65‚Äì81. Trove. Web. Police violence erupted when several hundred demonstrators assembled outside a Brisbane motel on Thursday 22 July 1971 where the Springbok team was staying. Observers claimed that the police, without warning or cause, charged at the demonstrators. Another confrontation took place between demonstrators and the police on the Friday night all but stopped short of physical violence. On Saturday evening, a large number of demonstrators assembled once more outside the Tower Mill Motel and after 15 minutes of peaceful protest, a brick was thrown into the motel room and police took action to clear the road and consequently disproportionate violence was used against demonstrators.Fitzgerald, Ross. \\"A History of Queensland, from 1915 to the 1980s.\\" University of Queensland Press, 1985.

Abc.net.au. Web. 7 May. 2012 =Campaigns and activities: 1977‚Äì1981= This era was an extremely contentious time for civil rights in Queensland. The first inquiry into police corruption under Bjelke-Petersen's government began; a major demonstrations took place and, it was an important era for women's rights in Queensland. Terry O'Gorman, one of the QCCL's most influential members, was also elected as President of the QCCL in 1979, taking over from Derek Fielding during this time. Terry O'Gorman and the QCCL members witnessed police corruption and the manner in which their clients were treated, which resulted in them \\"taking matters into their own hands\\" and secretly filming police. This would later be used as evidence against them in The Lucas Inquiry. The Lucas Inquiry The Lucas Inquiry, chaired by Justice GAG Lucas, began in 1976 and was constituted to look into police corruption. It was prompted by the QCCL, along with the Queensland Law Society, who demanded an inquiry after a continual stream of stories of police corruption began to surface in the media. The aims of this inquiry were to: *Investigate police fabrication of evidence and testimonies; *Protect individuals from police interrogation and harassment and; *To discover whether police have too much power interrogating, searching and arresting citizens. The Lucas Inquiry emanated from the 'Southport Betting Case,' a trial in which a number of high-ranking police officers were alleged to have fabricated evidence to clear two bookmakers of prosecution.\\"Report of a Commission Inquiry Persuant to Orders in Council\\" In November 1974 two suspected 'starting price' bookmakers, Brian Leonard George Sieber and Stanley Derwent Saunders, were charged and arrested \\"with possession of instruments of betting.\\" It was alleged these two men, and many other bookmakers operating in Brisbane and on the Gold Coast, were chief sources of \\"corrupt payments to police\\" in the Licensing Branch, a subsection of the Criminal Intelligence Unit. The CIU was a police department \\"formed to collect, record and disseminate intelligence on organized crime and corruption, and to apprehend and prosecute those involved.\\" In 1975, the results of the trial found neither men guilty and the loss was devastating to the campaign against both corruption and the integrity of the CIU. \\"The Criminal Intelligence Unit had failed to secure a prosecution in a seemingly iron-clad case-one where money was actually paid over, the vital conversations had been taped and most of the activities had been observed by members of the CIU.\\" This 'cover up' prompted the investigation into police behaviour, resulting in The Lucas Inquiry.Terry O'Gorman said at the National Convention on Civil Liberties, held in 1976, \\"the conclusions on the Southport Case cast serious doubt on the reliability and integrity of inspectors in the Queensland Police Force.\\" The Lucas report resulted in findings of significant police misconduct, corruption, assault and proof of police \\"planting evidence, forging warrants and fabricating confessions.\\" \\"It made 57 recommendations and spoke of the urgent need to reform the entire criminal law system to help the police and protect the public.\\"Clarke, Eddie. Guardian of Your Rights:Queensland Council for Civil Liberties: A History, 1966‚Äì2007. Brisbane: Supreme Court of Queensland Library, 2008. Print. One of the reports recommendations were that police interviews be recorded to reduce verballing. The practice of verballing relates to the \\"putting of damaging remarks into the mouths of suspects during police interrogation\\" or the \\"fabrication of evidence.\\"http://www.wiktionary.org O'Gorman, although praising the recommended introduction of tape recordings during police interviews, was highly critical of the report as there were no police charged with misconduct and many were even promoted.\\"Civil Libertarian and Criminal Lawyer Terry O'Gorman\\" ABC Local conversations with Richard Fidler 7 Aug 2008. Abc.net.au. Web. 7 May. 2012 He said \\"the inquiry has made the comment that here we have these officers who have not only not been proceeded against but a number of the principal offenders have been promoted. What sort of a police force do we have if the upper echelons of the police force are led to believe that mis- deeds will be rewarded by subsequent promotion.\\" The Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme Demonstration. On 29 July 1976, over a thousand students from The University of Queensland marched against Australian Government's financial assistance scheme for student, known as the Tertiary Education Scheme in Brisbane's central business district. Those students were on the side of better Federal Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowances for students and against the government's decision on Federal education budget cuts. Bjelke-Petersen instructed the police not to grant a permit for the march, and the police stopped the march along Coronation Drive. An officer struck Rose Marie Severin, who was a female student in the head with a baton during the struggle. This was recorded and reported on television that night and gave Severin a complicated time as a public figure regardless of her choice.McCallum, Alexandra. Personal Stories: Women's Activism. Queensland Review 14.1 (2007): 61‚Äì68. web. A student quoted on The Courier-Mail reported that she was not a radical; she was only trying to get out of the situation when she got a crack on the head from behind. QCCL attempted to take legal action on behalf of Severin but she reluctantly dropped the charges because she did not want any more publicity in the middle of university exams so the case did not continue any further. Street Protest Ban of 1977 In September 1977 the Queensland Government introduced a ban on all street protests, resulting in a statewide civil liberties campaign of defiance.Keim, Stephen. \\"The State of (Civil Liberties in Queensland): New Broom ‚Äì Same Dirt.\\" Legal Service Bulletin 13.1(1988):10‚Äì11. Web. This saw two thousand people arrested and fined, with another hundred being imprisoned, at a cost of almost five million dollars to the State Government.Plunkett, Mark and Ralph Summy 'Civil Liberties in Queensland: A nonviolent political campaign.' \\"Social Alternatives\\" Vol 1 no. 6/7, 1980 p 73-90 Bjelke-Petersen publicly announced on 4 September 1977 that \\"the day of the political street march is over...Don't bother to apply for a permit. You won't get one. That's government policy now.\\"Bjelke-Petersen, in Patience The Bjelke-Petersen premiership 1968‚Äì1983 : issues in public policy. Longman Cheshire: Melbourne. 1985. The main purposes for the ban appear to have been; 1\\\\. To remove a critical forum for mobilizing political pressure from the Anti-nuclear movement in Australia 2\\\\. To ensure that shipments of Uranium oxide could continue to be transported from the Mary Kathleen mine to Brisbane and further loaded onto overseas bound vessels without disruption from demonstrators 3\\\\. To provide Bjelke-Petersen with a law and order issue for the upcoming state elections. Under the old Traffic Act, if an applicant was refused a permit to march by the issuing authority, they would be able to appeal to the magistrate. Instead, the new laws sent all appeals to the police commissioner which resulted in appeals not being passed. In response to this, protesters came up with the idea of Phantom Civil Liberties Marches where protesters would gather and march until the police and media arrived. They would then disperse, and gather together again until the media and police returned, repeating the process over and over again.Summy, Ralph. Bruce Dickson and Mark Plunkett. \\"Phantom Civil Liberties Marches ‚Äì Queensland University 1978‚Äì79\\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgyX_01P1do Censorship into the 1980s In the lead up to the 1980s Queensland fell subject to many forms of censorship. In 1977 things had escalated from prosecutions and book burnings, under the introduction of the Literature Board of Review, to the statewide ban on protests and street marches. Despite the banning of marches in Queensland, numbers involved with the QCCL and similar protest groups continued to rise. Although the State Government felt that it was doing the right thing for Queenslanders, the QCCL argued that 'it is precisely these 'mob [protesters]' who got Australia out of the war in Vietnam; who stopped relations with South Africa sport; and are now joining with and broadening the trade union opposition to Fraser's uranium policy.' Since the formation of the QCCL tens of thousands of people got involved in rallies, pickets, and abortive and secret marches for civil liberties in nearly all of Queensland's major cities. This led to over 2000 people being arrested and some 4500 charges being given by police, despite the innumerable protest applications, all but one were denied. Throughout the late 1970s, more and more publications were banned reaching almost a hundred per year. In 1974 the Queensland Literature Board said that 'the prohibition of this material has nothing to do with the freedom of the individual to read... The pedlar, however, of all this whether he emerges from the lavatory of some gilded lair, must be restrained from using the magnificent services of printing, publication and distribution to present to all of us (and there is none of us immune to these depravities), the degradation of humans taking their sex as animals.' In 1978 the Full Court of Queensland convicted Forum magazine for its use of offensive language and the claims to dispel public ignorance in sexual matters. Strangely enough the very next year when the Australian versions of Penthouse and Playboy hit the stands, the Board did not instantly ban them. It wasn't until 1982 that Australian Playboy was banned. By this stage Queenslanders had begun to question the legitimacy of the board, even going so far as to call it an embarrassment to the state. Women's Rights Abortion was a topic which divided and concerned the early QCCL and meant that the many inquiries they received were passed onto Women's clinics. The Council was not pro-life, they were pro- choice. In 1976, a recommendation was made by the Federal Royal Commission on Human Relationships to support the right for a woman to terminate an unwanted pregnancy. The Councils Abortion Sub-Committee and Dr Janet Irwin presented an Abortion policy to the Council's meeting. The policy was revised and amended to note that considerations must be given to the foetus as a potential human being, this version was accepted. \\"The report stated that abortion was a health services that should be provided along with family planning, that a woman was the one best qualified to make the decision for herself about abortion, and that amendment should be made to the Criminal Code to enable abortions to be carried out by a registered medical practitioner or a person acting under the supervision and authority of a registered medical practitioner\\". However, as the Government's Pregnancy Termination Control Bill contained extensive restrictions and penalties for abortion, the demonstration against abortion legislation was held in 1980. Women who claimed for their right to make their decision about abortion participated against the Bill for a violation of civil rights and discrimination against women. Members of Children by Choice, an organisation for women who believe they have rights to make a choice to have an abortion, welcomed to have civil libertarians at the demonstration. The Council worked to prohibit discrimination of women in the workplace on many issues; marital status, pregnancy, breastfeeding and sexual harassment and discrimination. The Federal Discrimination Act of 1984 worked to assist the International Labor Organisations convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination. Domestic Violence The issue of domestic violence was addressed some 20 years into the establishment of the QCCL, who held a public meeting on the issue in 1989. The Domestic Violence (Family Protection) Act 1989 aimed to prevent violence between married partners or de factos. The Council made a submission in reference to the increased police powers proposed by the Act as they were concerned about the increase in police powers and the use of weapons. A Weapons Bill was introduced in 1990 and QCCL President Terry O'Gorman said \\"The Weapons Bill struck the correct balance between gun ownership and use on the one hand ‚Ä¶ and the crying imperative to do something positive about the unnecessary loss of life which has flowed from the ability of the disturbed or violent to buy a gun today .. and kill a stranger or a loved one tomorrow\\".Hansard, 46th Parliament, February 1990 ‚Äì May 1991, 4 September 1990, pp. 3431, 3444‚Äì5 The Council has since supported the amendments of The Domestic Violence Act to ban offenders from possessing guns while they were under a Protection Order. In 2012 the Domestic and Family Violence Protection Act was amended to reflect contemporary understandings of domestic and family violence. Examples of relationships that fall under the new act are same-sex relationships & \\"one night stands\\" where a child is produced.The New Domestic and Family Violence Protection Act 2012 MCG Legal. Retrieved on 2013-11-12. Rights of Prostitutes The QCCL addresses the issue of sex discrimination and many other issues relative to women's rights in prostitution. In 1991, The Council made a submission to the Criminal Justice Commission to have prostitution decriminalised on the basis that it was a waste of police resources, saying the law was hypocritical and expressing that a connection existed between the criminalisation of prostitution and police corruption. Following the submission, the CJC released a report 'Regulating Morality ‚Äì An Inquiry into Prostitution into Queensland' suggesting a three- year trial of the decriminalisation of prostitution and the move to brothels in Queensland. However, the Prostitution Laws Amendment Act 1992 was passed without the inclusion of any of the CJC's recommendations, as the government stated that these recommendations would prove \\"costly and unworkable.\\" The Act banned brothels, a prostitute's ability to legally advertise their services and red-light districts which meant that prostitutes were forced to walk the streets to gather work.http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/ACTS/1992/92AC065.pdf Terry O'Gorman stated in his 1992 Presidents Report that the 1992 Act would have negative health consequences on those who worked in the sex industry and an increase in police powers. The Councils continued rallying,creating of submissions and discussions with government officials resulted in the provision of the Prostitution Act 1999. The Act created the State's first legal boutique brothels which could be legally established by a person with no criminal convictions in commercial or industrial areas, have a maximum of five rooms and which could employ two to ten staff.http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/P/ProstitutA99.pdf The 1999 Act proved effective for The Queensland Sex Industry and Terry O'Gorman stated in an interview in 2005 with the ABC, on Tasmania's re-working of the Sex Industry Offences Act,\\"What the Tasmanian Parliament have got to do is look at other models that have worked well in Australia, particularly the Queensland model, where you've got state approved brothels where prostitution in those circumstances are legal,\\" he said.\\"Civil Libertarians Urge Rethink On Sex Industry Laws.\\" ABC Premium News (n.d.): Australia/New Zealand Reference Centre. Web. 20 May 2012 Sexual Rights In a press release published on 28 October 1989, the QCCL states that a person's sexuality was entirely his or her own business and not the Governments and this view set the tone for the QCCL's involvement in the sexual rights of Queenslanders.UQ Fryer Library, Box 31 In 1976, the Council opposed the Department of Education's decision not to employ a student teacher, despite a contract, due to his sexuality. Their opposition was unsuccessful. In the following years, the Council worked to oppose discriminatory Government action against the gay community. President of the time, Matt Foley found gaps in the amended Liquor Act which forbid hotel licensees to allow drug dealers, sexual perverts, deviants and child molesters on licensed Premises, but failed to define what a 'deviant' was. QCCL President Steven Keim campaigned against the harassment of the gay community through letters and by enlisting the help of Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs and trade, who wrote a letter to the Queensland Premier, Mike Ahern, urging him to change the laws. The Government refused to comply and as the Council was feeling under pressure, the Gay Law Reform Association formed. The Council supported the work of the Association as a more effective way to campaign. Most recently, the Council have supported to gay and lesbian groups in seeking the recognition of single sex relationships. Single sex relationships are recognised in areas such as domestic violence, succession law, and the division of jointly owned property. Terry O'Gorman In 1979, Terry O'Gorman was elected President of the QCCL and served as president up until 1985.He again held presidency from 1990 to 1994.He is currently the Vice President of the QCCL.O'Gorman specialises in criminal law, yet it was the area of Aboriginal Aid in which he first commenced his legal career. An influential member of the QCCL, Gorman stated \\"it was during the days as a university student and under the rule of Joh Bjelke-Petersen\\" that he first became aware of the need to protect civil rights. In 2008 O'Gorman commented that \\"civil liberties on the streets have improved, but the battle has moved to a 'law and order auction' being played out in the media, which used to be centred around the political cycle but now appears to be a permanent fixture.\\" =Campaigns and activities: 1982‚Äì1986= This was yet another tumultuous period for the QCCL. Another police inquiry began,The Police Complaints Tribunal,and the Commonwealth Games were held in 1982 amongst protests campaigning for Indigenous rights. By 1982, it was now obviously clear to the QCCL that none of the 57 Lucas recommendations had been implemented. More claims of corrupt policing surfaced and any police officer who 'whistle blew' on another police officer would soon find their careers destroyed. The Police Complaints Tribunal This tribunal was set up in 1982 and lasted until 1990.It was yet another inquiry into police corruption and also a concerted effort to improve public opinion on accusations of corruption within the police force. The QCCL president at the time, Terry O'Gorman, believed this would be better than the previous inquiry, of \\"police investigating themselves,\\" although said there would still be the deterrent for persons lodging a complaint as there were limited protections for the complainant against police retaliation.O'Gorman also claimed the PCT \\"lacked independence, which was confirmed by a damning public revelation of police malpractice which appeared on a Four Corners episode in 1986.\\" In one case a man claimed he was forced to make a full confession to police in response to their \\"threats to harm his family, and when he lodged a complaint with the PCT, it vindicated the police and totally discredited him.\\" The Commonwealth Games Act 1982 A demonstration for Aboriginal land rights, marches through Brisbane during the 1982 Commonwealth Games Street marches were banned during the 1982 Commonwealth Games, allowing police to make arrests to anyone holding a placard or circulating a booklet about any Aboriginal issue near Game venues following by the Government's approval of the Commonwealth Games Act 1982 which would in effect attempt to prevent Aborigines from bringing out Land Right's issues during the Games. Queensland police gave permits to only two marches from the centre of Brisbane to protest rallies at Musgrave Park, Brisbane before the Games. On 26 September 1982, the day the Games commenced, nearly 2,000 people marched carrying placards and banners across the Brisbane River and on 29 September, the march was reduced by half. Thirty-nine people were arrested at a demonstration on the opening of the Commonwealth Games and a few days later, police arrested 104 protesters who were charged under the Queensland Government's Commonwealth Games security laws. A further 260 protesters were also arrested within three days of the opening of the Games. However, the demonstration did not stop and continued in Melbourne. Despite the numerous arrests, these protests were considered successful for gaining national and international attention not only about the Indigenous issues but the right to protest peacefully.O'Conner, Brian. \\"400 Police Mop Up a Match.\\" Daily Sun 8 Oct 1982. Print. =Campaigns and activities: 1987‚Äì2001= This era was another turning point for civil rights in Queensland with the end of a controversial Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen's reign and the beginning of The Fitzgerald Inquiry. It was not until 1987 that Terry O'Gorman's brother Assistant Police Commissioner Frank O'Gorman implemented the reforms recommended by the Lucas Inquiry in 1977. The Fitzgerald Inquiry The Fitzgerald Inquiry began in 1987 and Tony Fitzgerald, QC, was appointed as its head on 26 May. The inquiry was a turning point in the fight for civil rights and the investigation of police misconduct and corruption. The inquiry was 'sparked' by frequent media talk of corruption by police at the highest level, involving alleged \\"illegal gambling, prostitution, kickbacks and brown paper bags.\\" Yet it was an episode on Four Corners entitled 'Moonlight State' that ignited the inquiry.\\"The Fitzgerald Inquiry.\\" Crime and Misconduct Commission Queensland.http://www.cmc.qld.gov.au/about-us/our-organisation/our- background/fitzgerald-inquiry\\" Tony Fitzgerald The inquiry's objectives were to view \\"five criminal identities and any corrupt links within the police force over the previous five years.\\"Fitzgerald persuaded the Government to extend the terms of the inquiry to give him the power to investigate any criminal activities and official misconduct by the police. Members of the Council were elated with the inquiry, believing that Fitzgerald was a strong candidate for the role. The intention of the Fitzgerald report was to \\"usher in a bold new age of transparency, innovation and integrity in politics and public sector management.\\"Fitzgerald envisioned a model of transparency in government, just elections,and non-corrupt policing through \\"the elimination of graft and gratuities;the removal of cronyism, nepotism and bias in public service appointments and decisions; and a scientifically grounded criminal justice system focused on crime prevention and progressive law reform.\\"Prenzler, T. 2009, \\"Reform in Politics, Criminal Justice and the Police in Post-Fitzgerald Queensland\\", Griffith Law Review, vol. 18, no. 3, pp. 576‚Äì595 During the Inquiry, then president of the QCCL Terry O'Gorman cross-examined Joh Bjelke-Petersen, who had attempted to shut down the inquiry unsuccessfully. In 1987, during the process of the Fitzgerald Inquiry, it had become glaringly clear to the National Party that their leader, Bjelke Petersen, was a political liability and he was consequently forced to stand down as Premier on 1 December. The inquiry lasted two years, heard from 339 witnesses and resulted in over 100 recommendations. Many policies recommended by the Council were endorsed in the report. The report and recommendations of the Fitzgerald inquiry were released in July 1989 and exposed evidence that a \\"corrupt elite were running Queensland ‚Äì politicians, police and businessmen who were criminally involved in a world of drugs, prostitution and covert deals.\\" \\"Tony Fitzgerald did not want to be confined to looking just at specific allegations against specific people ‚Äì he wanted the freedom to look into 'any other matter or thing appertaining to the aforesaid matters', and he did not want to look only at related matters but at any matter whether it related or not. By the time he was finished looking, the police commissioner had toppled, 30 years of National Party Government was all but over, Queensland was fundamentally altered and Fitzgerald, by giving indemnities in return for evidence, had set a new standard for commissions of inquiry.\\" Also after the inquiry there were encouraging reforms that occurred in regards to the legalisation of homosexuality, and a more liberal and regulated approach to gambling. The Criminal Justice Commission Operating from 1989 to 2001, The Criminal Justice Commission was a permanent institution designed to assist the implementation of the recommended reforms in the Fitzgerald Inquiry. The Criminal Justice Commissions \\"is empowered under the Criminal Justice Act to investigate all cases of alleged or suspected misconduct by members of the Police Service that come to its notice from any source, including information from an anonymous source.\\"\\"Report on an inquiry into allegations of Police Misconduct at Inala in November 1990.\\"Criminal Justice Commission. Goprint, Brisbane. 1991. Print. The CJC called for the abolishment of the Police Special Branch which held files on individuals who had shown lawful opposition toward government policies, as well as other many other reforms in the past. The QCCL's O'Gorman did not approve of the destruction of these files, until those who the files concerned,I.e. those who had participated in anti- government protests, were able to access the files themselves. One of the Council's primary concerns was \\"that the CJC had broad investigative powers overriding many basic protections which citizens had been entitled to in law.\\"For example, \\"the Council believed that names should not be published in CJC reports because the publication of such names with respect to findings clearly had the potential to damage individuals reputations, and prejudice any criminal proceeding that might follow.\\" In 1997 police 'move on' powers were introduced by the Government of Queensland which effectively gave police the power to 'move people on' from, \\"prescribed places such as shops, schools, licensed premises, railway station or shopping mall.The CMC states \\"police essentially have the power to move people on if they are causing anxiety to another person,\\" yet Terry O'Gorman states \\"it is a sad fact that in many circumstances certain people will feel threatened by an Aboriginal person, not because of their behaviour but by the very fact that they are Indigenous.\\" O'Gorman argues that \\"the effect of section 47 of the Act is that police officers are asking themselves, is this person, by the fact of who they are or what they look like, likely to cause anxiety to others and when making this determination, issues of race, apparel, state of cleanliness and social status are likely to come into play and work against minority groups, such as Indigenous Australians.\\"\\"Police Move On Powers:A CMC Review of Their Use.Crime and Misconduct Commission Queensland.Dec 2010. =Campaigns and activities: 2002‚Äì2011= Since 2001, the QCCL is still as relevant as it always has been. It has kept a close watch on the new police corruption commission, the Crime and Misconduct Commission, as well as drug driving and privacy laws. The Crime and Misconduct Commission This was a new commission formed in 2001, which is still in existence and their objectives are \\"to combat major crime,to improve the integrity of the Queensland public sector and reduce the incidence of misconduct in this sector.\\" Other responsibilities of this Commission are to manage a witness protection scheme. The Council has been critical of the CMC.For example,in 2010, the QCCL called for major reforms in the police complaints process after footage was released of Cameron Doomadgee, a man who died in the 2004 Palm Island death in custody.Terry O'Gorman said the system had failed as the CMC came to the conclusion that the officers being investigated over the incident \\"were unprofessional and part of a self- protecting police culture.\\"\\"Palm Island Case Proves System 'Broken'.1 Dec.2010.

The Council's job has been made more difficult since the introduction of social media sites and generally platforms for where a persons privacy could be jeopardised. Also protecting the rights of criminals and in particular, the civil rights of sex offenders is an example of the difficult space the Council works in. In a recent article, following convicted child molester Dennis Ferguson's placement in Murgon, the Australian Council for Civil Liberties stated that the government must provide child molesters some form of protection from community uproar, attacks and generally restricting an individuals civil liberties.Murdoch, A and Nikki Toad. \\"Paedophile run out of Qld Home\\" General Newswire 1 Feb 2005:1 The council spoke out in 2009 over the controversial 'drug driving' laws being introduced arguing that they breach ones civil liberties and that there will be an extension of police powers that accompany this.Prichard, Jeremy, Alison Matthews, Raimondo Bruno, Katherine Rayment and Helen James.\\" Detouring Civil Liberties?Drug-Driving Laws in Australia.\\" Griffith Law Review 19.2 (2010):330‚Äì349.

As Cardiologist, Dr. Bunwaree was responsible for the setting up of a full-fledged ICU and Diagnostic Cardiac Unit at the Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam National Hospital in view of starting permanent cardiac surgery centre in Mauritius. Having served as the Vice President and Secretary General of the Mauritian Labour Party, Dr. Bunwaree has been elected as a Member of Parliament in 1987, 1991, 1995, 2005 and 2010. He was considered to be a close confidante of the Prime Minister, and is one of the few remaining Ministers from the era when Navin Ramgoolam took over the leadership of the Labour Party. He was always elected in Constituency No 12, Mahebourg and Plaine Magnien. His tenure as minister was characterised by numerous bold reforms and he presented new labour laws to the parliament which were voted in as the Employment Rights Act (2008) and the Employment Relations Act (2008). These reforms and legislation generated expected criticism from the trade unions, similar to more recent reforms undertaken in the Education sector.

He was resident playwright at the Dovecot Arts Centre in Stockton-on-Tees for the 1977 season. In 1980, he was resident playwright at the Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh. In 2008, he signed a letter against Bush Theatre budget cuts. He was educated at Alleyn Court School, Westcliff-on-Sea; Malvern College in Worcestershire; Borough Road College in Isleworth, London, where he trained to be a teacher; and University College London, where he achieved a BA Honours degree in English Literature. In the early 1970s, Wilcox founded Northern Playwrights Society with dramatist C.P.Taylor to promote the interests of playwrights living in the Northern Arts region. This has evolved into New Writing North, which is one of Britain's most successful regional writers' agencies. In addition to his theatre writing, Wilcox edited five volumes of Gay Plays for Methuen, who also published his autobiographical journal of 1989, Outlaw in the Hills. His monograph \\"Benjamin Britten's Operas\\" was published by Absolute Press in 1997 and was shortlisted by the Royal Philharmonic Society for its music book of the year award. Wilcox has also worked as opera librettist for John Metcalf's Tornrak (Welsh National Opera: 1990) and Eddie McGuire's Cullercoats Tommy (Northern Sinfonia and Northern Stage: 1993). For Opera North, he worked with Jeremy Sams on a new libretto for Chabrier's Le roi malgr√© lui that was first staged at the Edinburgh International Festival as The Reluctant King in 1995. His television dramas include episodes of Crown Court and Cluedo, Cricket (BBC TV : Plays for Tomorrow:1981), Accounts (C4 : Film on Four:1982), Lent (BBC TV : 1985 : Pye and TRICS awards for best script of the year), Inspector Morse : Last Bus to Woodstock (1988) and Doctor Finlay : Winning the Peace (STV : 1993).

On 4 February 2004, the New York Times carried a story claiming that SCOPE supplied nuclear components to Libya as part of a rogue network masterminded by Pakistani atomic weapons supremo Dr A. Q. Khan. Scomi denied any wrongdoings. However, in 2009, the US Department of State announced that sanctions would be imposed on Scomi Chief Executive Officer, Shah Hakim Zain for his involvement in Dr Khan's nuclear-proliferation network. Subsequently, following US Govt sanctions on Shah Hakim, he has fought to clear his name in that country and succeeded in 2011. The sanctions were lifted by the US State department on Monday, 18 July, and the news was covered in Malaysian papers. Shah issued a statement as well, saying: \\"In reference to the lifting of the sanctions imposed, I am grateful to all who have helped, guided and supported Scomi Group and I for the past few years, in particular to the Government of Malaysia and all the agencies.

Before SCOPE was set up as a subsidiary of Scomi, it was known as Prisma Wibawa Sdn. Bhd. (PWSB).Report by Malaysian Police At first, PWSB had no production facility but after SCOPE was set up, a production facility was set up in 2001 in Shah Alam. The General Manager of SCOPE was Shamsul Bahrin Rukiban. In 2001, SCOPE was reported to have secured a contract to supply components to a Dubai-based customer. In 2002, Scomi CEO, Shah Hakim Zain, was appointed director of SCOPE along with Mansor Tahir and Hilmy Zaini Zainal. In that year, the company had MYR250,000 in paid up capital. Assets of MYR1.5 million, turnover of MYR12 million and profits of MYR1 million. On 7 January 2005, Scomi Group Bhd proposed to acquire from SCOPE 250,000 ordinary shares of RM1.00 each, representing the entire issued and paid-up share capital of SCOPE for RM250,000 from its wholly owned subsidiary company, Scomi Sdn. Bhd. The control of the net assets and operations of SCOPE was effectively transferred to Scomi Group Bhd and the Group‚Äôs effective interest in SCOPE remained unchanged at 100%.  BSA Tahir  Soon after the NY Times article, the Malaysian police announced that one of Scomi's main backers, B.S.A. Tahir, had confessed to helping Dr Khan sell nuclear secrets and supplies to Iran and Libya. He was detained without trial from 2006 to 2008 for allegedly being a national security risk, having been accused of fraudulently convincing SCOPE to produce components for centrifuges to be used in Libya's secret uranium enrichment program. Scomi officials insisted that B.S.A. Tahir had misled them to believe that the parts were intended for the oil and gas industry. However, Tahir is reported to have said that Shah Hakim Zain and Kamaluddin both knew the final destination of the products. He has accused Scomi of making fraudulent declarations and in 2009 he sued Shah Hakim and Kamaluddin for MYR75 million.  Japanese involvement  On 26 August 2006, the CEO and four executives of the Mitutoyo Corporation were arrested by Tokyo Police in connection with the sale of equipment to Scomi, for the production of the centrifuge.NY Times 25 August 2006 Mitutoyo was also investigated for supplying expertise to SCOPE related to the centrifuge manufacturing project.Video of NHK News Bulletin Item U.S. sanctions On January 12, 2009, the US Department of State announced that sanctions would be imposed on Dr Khan and a number of his alleged associates including BSA Tahir, Scomi CEO, Shah Hakim Zain and SCOPE GM, Shamsul Bahrin, for their involvement in Dr Khan's nuclear proliferation network. These sanctions have the effect of prohibiting Shah Hakim or Shamsul Bahrin from doing business with the US government. However, Scomi itself was not among the companies listed in the sanctions. Malaysian government response Given the role of the Prime Minister's son as a major shareholder of Scomi, there were calls for an independent inquiry to be carried out into the allegation of Malaysia's role in Dr Khan's network. However, no independent inquiry was carried out. Following the 2009 decision to impose sanctions on Shah Hakim, the Malaysian Government announced that it would carry out further investigations into the matter. However, no further announcement has been made. Malaysia has ratified the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Following the breaking of the SCOPE scandal, the Malaysian government promised to tighten controls on exports of weapons-related equipment. However, in 2007 there were further reports that a Malaysian company was involved in the illegal arms trade, this time involving another Pakistani arms dealer, Jilani Humayun. There are no reports of the Malaysian government having taken action against the Malaysian company in either the case of Abdul Qadeer Khan or in the case of Jilani Humayun.

Reproduction Via sexual reproduction, and sexes are generally separate, however some hermaphrodites have been found. Population sex ratio is 1:1. Reproductive season is from October to February,Sewell, M. A. and P. R. Berquist. 1990. Variability in the reproductive cycle of Stichopus mollis (Echinodermata:Holothuroidea). Invertebrate Reproduction and Development. 17(1):1‚Äì7. and periodicity of spawning is regulated by lunar cycles, specifically following a full moon.Morgan, A. 2009. Spawning of the Temperate sea cucumber, Australostichopus mollis(Levin). Journal of the World Aquaculture Society. Vol. 40. No. 3. Morphologic changes in reproductive periods include females changes in gonad colour and oocyte numbers, while in males there is an increase in the amount of spermatozoa in particular zones described as \\"wet mounts of 'mashed' gonad tissue\\". Furthermore, there is an increase in spermatozoa in the lumen of histological sections. Studies suggest that spawning may occur repeatedly during a single reproductive season. Auto-evisceration Like other holothurians, A. mollis has the ability to regenerate its internal organs after undergoing a phenomenon called auto- evisceration. This process, which is thought to be induced by external stimuli, is characterized by violent and rapid expulsion of organs, followed by regeneration, which occurs at a slower rate than in other genera. Nevertheless, a more recent study reports no spontaneous evisceration or seasonal atrophy of the viscera, highlighting that handling these organisms does not trigger such reactions and even suggesting than during predation it would not occur easily.Zamora, L.N. and Jeffs, A.G., 2015. Evaluation of transportation methods of juveniles of the Australasian sea cucumber, Australostichopus mollis. Aquaculture research, 46(10), pp.2431‚Äì2442. Predation Available information posits the existence of just one predator: the starfish Luidia varia, observed in two cases. To date there is no evidence to suggest any fish or other organism preying on A. mollis. Juveniles Juveniles are distributed in the shallow sub-tidal zone (5‚Äì8 m of depth), relatively close to where adults are concentrated. However, they are usually found in a different substrata; one of smaller grain size, and associated to macroalgae as initial settlement, where they obtain detritus and protection from predators. These factors are thought to drive distribution, rather than and food type and availability. Experimental data shows high survival rates of juveniles using a natural diet, and still higher rates in a mussel waste medium. Thanks to attempts to produce juveniles in a commercial scale a better understanding of early post-settlement juveniles' growth and pigmentation process has been achieved Zamora, L.N., Maxwell, K.H. and Jeffs, A.G., 2017. Growth of Hatchery‚Äêreared Juveniles of the Australasian Sea Cucumber, Australostichopus mollis, Fed with Artificial and Natural Diets. Journal of the World Aquaculture Society, 48(4), pp.643‚Äì655. Fishery Processed sea cucumbers are traded under the name of beche-de-mer, representing an important fishery in South Pacific and Asian nations. In New Zealand, where its exploitation occurs on a small-scale, this species is under the New Zealand fisheries quota management system and is principally caught by free-diving. Sea cucumber yields can be very profitable if the resource is adequately processed, or if a value-added policy is implemented. Currently, due to the expansion of commercial exploitation of A. mollis in New Zealand and Australia, first attempts at massive culture are being carried out. A new approach to sea cucumber farming has been the so-called polyculture, where sea cucumber are bred together with mussels and finfish, consuming the wastes from nearby farming as a food supply, and at the same time providing new products. Trials farming sea cucumber with abalone have shown not to be biologically viable. Larvae development The complete larvae stage takes approximately 21 days. After fertilization there are seven stages of larva metamorphosis: cleavage, blastocyst, gastrulation, auricularia (subdivided in early, mid, late), doliolaria (mid metamorphic stage pre settlement), penttactula and the last settled sea cucumber larva, visible to the naked human eye, which develops into the final organism.Morgan, A. 2009. Spawning of the Temperate Sea Cucumber, Australostichopus mollis (Levin). Journal of the World Aquaculture Society. Vol. 40. No. 3 Polycultures Considering the detritus- feeding characteristic of holothurians, and their role on coastal marine systems, several studies have focussed on their grazing effect on sediments. These studies have calculated declines in total organic carbon and chlorophyll a and phaeopigment accumulation, positioning A. mollis as an effective tool to avoid, restore and control pollutive impacts of coastal bivalve aquaculture. In terms of evaluating the feasibility of polycultures, this has been evaluated in the field under Greenshell mussel Slater, M.J. and Carton, A.G., 2007. Survivorship and growth of the sea cucumber Australostichopus (Stichopus) mollis (Hutton 1872) in polyculture trials with green-lipped mussel farms. Aquaculture, 272(1‚Äì4), pp.389‚Äì398. and Pacific oysters' farms.Zamora, L.N., Dollimore, J. and Jeffs, A.G., 2014.

New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research, 48(3), pp.394‚Äì404. In land based systems, according to the energetic requirements of adult sea cucumbers, results have inferred that waste production of an industry standard-type abalone lacks sufficient energy to meet A. mollis metabolic needs. However, there is suggestion that feeding juveniles from these wastes could be feasible.Maxwell, K., Gardner, J.P.A., Heath, P., 2009. The effect of diet on the energy budget of the brown sea cucumber, Stichopus mollis (Hutton). J. World Aquac. Soc. 40: 159‚Äì170. Conversely, waste generation from fresh mussels have proven to be the source of enough energy to sustain juvenile stocks, assuming a suitable scale to ensure the supply. Sea cucumbers also have been used as bioremediation units in scenarios of high organic waste pollution from farming, such as salmon. In this instance, this carbon source is transformed into body tissue; an example of efficiently using supplies and producing an alternative culture.

Background The seven-volume work was one of several such publications resulting from the Ethnographic Survey of India project which was formally instituted by the Government of British India in 1901. The Survey was intended to record details of the manners, customs and physical features of Indian castes and tribes using in part the anthropometric methods that had first been used in India by Herbert Hope Risley for his own survey of the tribes and castes of Bengal. An eight-year period of funding was allotted for the purpose. The British government in India appointed a Superintendent of Ethnography for each province. Thurston, who had been Superintendent of the Madras Government Museum since 1885, had already conducted some ethnographic work in his studies of the hill tribes of Nilgiris District, published in 1894, and elsewhere. He was appointed Superintendent for Madras Presidency, while L. K. Ananthakrishna Iyer and N. Subramania Iyer were respectively appointed Superintendents for the princely states of Cochin and Travancore. The reports for the two princely states were later integrated with Thurston's work to form the Castes and Tribes of Southern India, as were the results of Thurston's earlier researches into the hill tribes. The state of Mysore was allocated to Thurston for anthropometric survey but excluded for ethnographic survey. In his investigations in Madras Presidency, Thurston was assisted by K. Rangachari of the Government Museum. Survey Thurston investigated the characteristics of over 300 castes and tribes of South India, representing over 40 million people across an area of . He was a disciple of Risley, who believed in a racial theory for the basis of caste, and borrow anthropometric equipment from the Asiatic Society of Bengal, including a Lovibond Tintometer, to assist in his survey of Madras. Thurston had to overcome suspicions felt by his subjects during the conduct of the survey, and sometimes had to rely on his official position as a representative of the government in order to obtain the measurements that he needed. Some believed that Thurston had been sent on a mission to kill them in order then to display their stuffed bodies in the Madras museum, while others considered his measuring to be a prelude to their recruitment into the army or to kidnap them, and yet others thought that the equipment used to measure their height was a gallows. A consequence of these difficulties was that his sample size was often as low as 30 ‚Äì 60 members of a caste or tribe, and sometimes as little as six or seven.

According to the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (IMEA), among the approximately 690 East Indians living in Venezuela, 400 were Venezuelans of East Indian origin, 280 were Indian citizens and 10 were stateless residents. However, unofficial records put the Indo-Caribbean community from Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago over 50,000. Migration History During the oil-related high-income years of the 1970s, there were around 400 NRIs in Venezuela. The Indian community consisted of personnel from the petroleum and petrochemical sectors, as well as a large number of traders. Many of them had taken their families with them to Venezuela. Most of the traders belonged to the Sindhi community but there were also some persons from Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Punjab. When the oil boom ended in 1982, followed by devaluation of the local currency, many of the NRIs decided to seek their fortunes elsewhere.

Both creations are extinct. The Tichborne Baronetcy, of Tichborne in the County of Hampshire, was created in the Baronetage of England on 8 March 1621 for Sir Benjamin Tichborne, who was a Member of Parliament (MP) for Petersfield from 1588 to 1589 and for Hampshire in 1593. The inheritance of the titles has been complicated, coming through two sons of Sir Benjamin, 1st Bt, Richard and Walter. Sir Richard, 2nd Bt, eldest son of 1st BT. He married Susan Waller and was succeeded by his son Sir Henry, 3rd Bt who married Mary Arundell. He was succeeded by his son Sir Henry 4th Bt, who married Mary Kemp. The 4th Bt had only daughters so was succeeded by his brother Sir John, 5th Bt, a Jesuit priest. One daughter of Sir Henry (4th Bt), Mary Agnes married Michael Blount of Mapledurham. The baronetcy then reverted to descendants of Sir Benjamin's second son, Sir Walter Tichborne, Kt, of Aldershot. Sir Walter married Mary White, by her inheriting land in Aldershot (the family had a home in Aldershot Park for many years before building a grander home at Manor Park where their descendants lived for nearly 200 years). His son Francis Tichborne married Susanna Hawes and their son White Tichborne, an MP, married, secondly, Anne Supple. White's son James Tichborne married Mary Rudyard (or Rudyerd) and their son Henry became the 6th Bt and married his fourth cousin, Mary Blount, daughter of Michael Blount and Mary Agnes Tichborne. Thus later baronets are genealogically descended from both lines. Lady Tichborne, Sir Roger Charles Tichborne's mother Roger Charles Tichborne: one of two daguerrotypes taken in South America in 1853‚Äì54 Sir Henry's son, Sir Henry, 7th Bt, married Elizabeth Plowden and they had seven sons. Their eldest son Sir Henry, 8th Bt, married Anne Burke and they had seven daughters and no sons. The 8th Bt was succeeded by his brother Edward, who had taken the name Doughty and on becoming 9th Bt assumed the name, Sir Edward Tichborne-Doughty. He married Katherine Arundell and his son died as a child, so he was succeeded by his brother Sir James Tichborne, 10th Bt, who married Henriette Felicite Seymour. Following the disappearance in 1854 of Roger Charles Tichborne, the heir to title of the 10th Baronet, the appearance in 1866 of a claimant led to a highly-publicised legal battle known as the Tichborne Case, at the end of which the claimant was declared an impostor. In 1866, the wealth of the 11th Baronet included Tichborne Park's , manors, lands and farms in Hampshire, and considerable properties in London and elsewhere, which altogether produced an annual income of over ¬£20,000,McWilliam 2007, pp. 36‚Äì37 equivalent to several millions in 21st-century terms.MeasuringWorth.com Sir Alfred, the 11th Bt was the younger son of Sir James, 10th Bt. He married Theresa Arundell and died young leaving his wife pregnant. Theresa gave birth shortly afterwards to Sir Henry, 12th Bt. Sir Henry married Gwendolyne Petre whose grandmother was Julia Tichborne, one of the seven daughters of the 8th Bt. Their only child, Sir Joseph Doughty-Tichborne, 13th Bt married Denise Greville. Their only child Sir Anthony Doughty-Tichborne, 14th Bt married Antonia Snagge. Having three daughters, and a son who died in infancy, and there being no surviving heirs in the male line from Sir Benjamin, 1st Bt, the baronetcy became extinct upon Sir Anthony's death in 1968. The Tichborne Baronetcy, of Beaulieu in County Louth, was created in the Baronetage of England on 12 July 1697 for Henry Tichborne. He was ennobled in 1715 as Baron Ferrard of Beaulieu, with which title the baronetcy then merged until its extinction in 1731. Lord Ferrard was son of Sir William Tichborne of Beaulieu, son of the statesman and general Sir Henry Tichborne, younger son of Sir Benjamin Tichborne, 1st Baronet.

Polemical in nature, the book contends that sentimentality has become culturally entrenched in British society, with harmful consequences. The author uses a range of cultural, educational, political, media and literary issues‚Äîincluding falling standards in education, UK aid policies for African development, the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, and the work and life of Sylvia Plath‚Äîto illustrate what he sees as the danger of abandoning logic in favour of sentimentality, which he describes as \\"the progenitor, the godparent, the midwife of brutality\\". Much of Dalrymple's analysis is underpinned by his experience of working with criminals and the mentally ill. Spoilt Rotten received a mostly favourable reception in the media. Dalrymple was praised for carrying out a thought- provoking and convincing analysis of a newly emerged cultural phenomenon which sees emotion substituted for reason. Some critics, however, accused the author of cynicism and misanthropic pessimism in his approach, and the historian Noel Malcolm claimed that Dalrymple had overreached in his analysis. Background Before the book's publication, Dalrymple had alluded on a number of occasions in his writing to the issue of sentimentality in contemporary society. In an essay in 1999, he identified what he saw as the harmful role played by sentimentality in a case involving Stephen Lawrence. Lawrence, a young black British man, was murdered and the subsequent case was mired in accusations of racism among the investigating police. Dalrymple wrote that \\"the response to the Stephen Lawrence case is another example of how the rule of law is to be supplanted by the rule of sentiment‚Äîand it is yet one more instance of what one might call the Dianafication of British public life, in which transitory popular enthusiasm trumps venerable tradition\\". In a 2004 essay, he analysed how sentimentality towards children was closely linked with violence and neglect, particularly in the poorest sections of British society: \\"The upbringing of children in much of Britain is a witches' brew of sentimentality, brutality, and neglect, in which overindulgence in the latest fashions, toys, or clothes, and a television in the bedroom are regarded as the highest‚Äîindeed only‚Äîmanifestations of tender concern for a child's welfare\\". Before the book's publication, Dalrymple analysed two high-profile cases in the British media involving Raoul Moat and Jon Venables. Dalrymple described Moat as \\"a brutal sentimentalist. He used the extremity of his behaviour to persuade himself that he felt something‚Äîsupposedly love‚Äîvery deeply, and that this was the motive and justification of his behaviour\\". Referring to Venables, Dalrymple wrote, \\"Probation officers persistently refused to see the writing on Venables's wall. They explained away the obvious signs of his continuing bad character. Just a little more kindness, understanding. What contempt he must have felt! Thus sentimentality, a refusal to face unpleasant realities, causes crime\\". Synopsis =Chapter One: Sentimentality= Jean-Jacques Rousseau Dalrymple begins the chapter by citing several examples to illustrate how sentimentality is increasing as a cultural phenomenon in the United Kingdom. He then analyses falling education standards in the country, and links these trends to \\"powerful intellectual currents\\" that \\"feed into the great Sargasso Sea of modern sentimentality about children\\", and asserts that in this regard the ideas of the philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau and the psychologist Steven Pinker have been particularly influential. He then examines a newspaper article which advocates reform of the British prison system. Dalrymple states that the article aroused an emotion \\"whose effect, if not its intention, was to convince the person experiencing it that he was a person of superior sensibility and compassion\\", and that such emotionality \\"often attaches to the question of crime and punishment in contemporary Britain\\". Dalrymple also cites a modern tendency for criminals under the influence of drugs or alcohol not to be held morally responsible for their crimes. Dalrymple takes issue with this, and agrees with Aristotle that a man is doubly culpable: first for the offence committed, and second for having intoxicated himself. Dalrymple also maintains that it is \\"the sheerest sentimentality to see drug addicts as the victims of an illness\\" and that, \\"sentimentality is now a mass phenomenon almost beyond criticism or even comment\\". =Chapter Two: What is Sentimentality?= Dalrymple advances that the kind of sentimentality that he wishes to draw attention to is \\"an excess of emotion that is false, mawkish, and over-valued by comparison with reason\\" and which is performed \\"in full public view\\". Dalrymple contends that \\"Sentimentality is the expression of emotion without judgment. Perhaps it is worse than that: it is the expression of emotion without an acknowledgement that judgment should enter into how we should react to what we see and hear. It is the manifestation of a desire for the abrogation of an existential condition of human life, namely the need to always and never unendingly to exercise judgment. Sentimentality is therefore childish and reductive of our humanity\\". In this chapter he also takes issue with a number of assertions made by the philosopher Robert C. Solomon, including that sentimentality does not manipulate emotions, cause false emotions to be shown, or distort perception and interfere with rational thought. =Chapter Three: The Family Impact Statement= Dalrymple criticises the introduction by Harriet Harman of the Family Impact Statement. Dalrymple writes that such statements \\"are not permitted to influence the outcome of a case. They are made only after a jury has made its verdict\\". As a result, kitsch displays of emotion are encouraged in court, of no practical benefit. =Chapter Four: The Demand for Public Emotion= Dalrymple analyses the media attention and reaction to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, and how certain media interpreted a perceived lack of emotion on the part of the girl‚Äôs parents as evidence of guilt. Dalrymple writes that the \\"demand that emotion should be shown in public, or be assumed not to exist and therefore indicate a guilty mind, is now not an uncommon one\\", and cites two similar cases involving Joanne Lees and Lindy Chamberlain. Dalrymple then analyses the outcry from the public and the media to the lack of emotion shown by the Queen after the death of Princess Diana, and contends that \\"the tabloid newspapers carried out what can only be called a campaign of bullying against the sovereign\\" and that those gathered outside Buckingham Palace were \\"bullying rather than expressing any genuine grief\\". He concludes by asserting that the sentimentality shown by both the media and the public ‚Äúwas inherently dishonest in a way that parallels the dishonesty that lies behind much sentimentality itself\\". =Chapter Five: The Cult of the Victim= Dalrymple analyses the poet Sylvia Plath, whom he describes as the \\"patron saint of self-dramatization\\", and interprets Margaret Drabble's descriptions of Plath as a \\"willing casualty\\" and \\"supremely vulnerable\\" to mean \\"virtues of a high order\\". He then examines how Plath blamed her father for her suffering, and identifies him in her poem \\"Daddy\\" with Nazism and makes allusions to the Holocaust. Dalrymple writes that \\"Plath felt it right to allude to one of the worst and most deliberate inflictions of mass-suffering in the whole of human history, merely on the basis that her father, who died when she was young, was German‚Ä¶the metaphorical use of the holocaust measures not the scale of her suffering, but of her self-pity\\". He asserts that before Plath, self-pity \\"was regarded as a vice, even a disgusting one, that precluded sympathy\\", and that \\"the appropriation of the suffering of others to boost the scale and significance of one's own suffering is now a commonplace.\\" He then analyses a number of figures, including Binjamin Wilkomirski and Margaret Seltzer, who he alleges \\"make bogus claims to victim status\\" and whose stories reveal perfectly \\"the dialectic between sentimentality and brutality\\". Dalrymple ends the chapter by analysing victimhood in the criminal justice system and concludes, \\"For the sentimentalist, of course, there is no such thing as a criminal, only an environment that has let him down\\". =Chapter Six: Make Poverty History!= Dalrymple asserts that across the globe chronic poverty has decreased in the past twenty-five years, but mainly in China and India. As a result, \\"Africa is an exception and therefore is the current focus of sentimentality about poverty\\". In this context he examines Gordon Brown's desire as prime minister to ensure that every child in Africa receive a primary education. Dalrymple questions whether there is a link between improving educational standards and increasing economic growth in the continent, and cites the experience of Tanzania under Julius Nyerere, Equatorial Guinea under Macias Nguema, and Sierra Leone's fate after a \\"long history of historical effort and achievement\\" as evidence that this may not be so, and argues that Africa's priority is access to markets. Dalrymple concludes that Brown's position is pure sentimental posturing and smacks of \\"Singerian moral universalism\\", which is \\"preposterous‚Äîpsychologically, theoretically, and practically\\". In the book's Conclusion, Dalrymple contends that \\"in field after field, sentimentality has triumphed\\", and this has had a number of harmful consequences, including the lives of millions of children being blighted by overindulgence and neglect; the destruction of educational standards; and brutality wherever policies suggested by sentimentality have been advocated. Release The book was originally published in the UK in hardback on 29 July 2010 by Gibson Square Books Ltd. The book had at least one alternative subtitle before The Toxic Cult of Sentimentality was finally chosen, and the US edition had the subtitle How Britain is Ruined by Its Children. The book's front cover featured a wrongly attributed comment, \\"a taboo-shattering, sacred cow-slaughtering, myth-destroying little gem of a book\\" by Dominic Lawson; Lawson had in fact written this in 2007 in a review of another Dalrymple US- published book, Romancing Opiates: Pharmacological Lies and the Addiction Bureaucracy. The paperback edition of Spoilt Rotten appeared in the UK on 11 August 2011. Critical reception After it was released the book received a mostly positive response in the media. In The Spectator, Jonathan Sumption praised the book, writing \\"The public hysteria surrounding such high-profile incidents as the death of the Princess of Wales and the search for Madeleine McCann, or the eccentricities of the MacPherson report on the death of Stephen Lawrence are analysed with the author's customary mixture of shrewdness, cynicism and misanthropic pessimism. These phenomena have of course been analysed before, and many of the same points have been made. But Dalrymple is good at relating them to broader trends in our society\\". The book was described by Toby Young in The Daily Telegraph as being an \\"excellent new book attacking the cult of sentimentality\\" and that Dalrymple also \\"makes a convincing case that standards in British education have plummeted in the last few decades\\". Young also reviewed the book on his blog No Sacred Cows, where he wrote, \\"...the remarkable thing about Spoilt Rotten is that Dalrymple never lets his anger obscure his compassion. Throughout the book you get a powerful sense that his outrage is rooted in a commitment to social justice. Yes, he believes members of the underclass should be weaned off the nanny state and forced to take responsibility for themselves, but he also believes it is left- wing intellectuals who have reduced them to a state of helpless infantalism, mainly through the promotion of the cult of sentimentality. He is not a Christian, but believes that it is only when Britain's benefit dependents rediscover the doctrine of Original Sin that they will be able to help themselves\\". Also in The Daily Telegraph, Ed West gave the book a favourable review, writing \\"Sentimentality, in which crude emotion replaces dispassionate analysis, affects all aspects of public life, such as the debates over education, prison places and overseas aid. As Dalrymple points out, no country has ever escaped poverty via international aid‚Äîbut never mind, since what matters is not actually doing anything about state education or crime or Africa, but being seen to be caring about the 'vulnerable'\\". The book was listed as a non-fiction choice by Steven Poole in The Guardian, who wrote, \\"Dalrymple alternates vague ranting with surgical demolition (he is excellent on the fatuity of 'family impact statements' in court), and exhibits impressive thrift, in these uncertain times, with his research, getting tens of pages out of a single visit to WHSmith and the purchase of two newspapers. Perhaps the most suggestive sentence is tucked away in an endnote about tattoos: 'I wish I had the space to elaborate on the dermatological semiotics of violence in England'. If only someone had awarded him that space\\". The book was also the subject of a spoof review by John Crace in The Guardian, which satirised the book and its author. Spoilt Rotten was chosen by Jasper Fforde on the Penguin Books website as one of the books he would most like to get for Christmas. Fforde wrote that the book, \\"makes uneasy reading for huggy liberals, and asks harsh questions over the bizarre sense of sentimentality that seems to have befuddled us Brits ever since millions of us queued up to sign a book of condolences for a princess we didn't know. Dalrymple looks at the downside of an overblown sense of sentiment, which resulted this year with a murderous thug who saw himself as a victim and found 32,000 people agreeing with him, and even opening a tribute Facebook page in his posthumous honor\\". Spoilt Rotten also made Thomas Sowell's list of Christmas books for 2010. A positive review in The Scotsman stated, \\"Dalrymple tackles sentimentality on every front. He is frequently witty, always punchy and sometimes rapier-like, as he analyses the 'bunk' of his opponents to within an inch of its cant\\". In the Daily Express, Neil Hamilton reviewed the book positively, writing, \\"Theodore Dalrymple's excellent Spoilt Rotten offers some thought-provoking insights and explains how emotional constipation in our national psyche has become emotional diarrhoea\\". In a negative review in The Sunday Telegraph, historian Noel Malcolm suggested that Dalrymple \\"is spreading his net too widely, so that 'sentimentality' comes to stand for any moralising view that does not satisfy his own scrutiny; it's not that these things should not be criticised, merely that sentimentalism may not be the key to what is wrong with them\\". Malcolm also questioned Dalrymple's views on modern educational theory, writing \\"these ideas have long and complex histories, in which sentimentalism is only part of the story. The 'progressive' attack on discipline, and on traditional institutions such as the family, was concerned as much with power-structures and class as it ever was with sentiment or human goodness\\", and took issue with Dalrymple's assessment of Rousseau. In a short negative review of the book in The Independent on Sunday, which appeared after the book's 2011 paperback release, Brandon Robshaw wrote, \\"There is some good sense here, but it's vitiated by the pompous, peevish tone, the futile nostalgia for an airbrushed past, unnecessary sideswipes (at John Rawls, for example, or climate science) and by the poor editing\\". In an ambivalent review on the website MercatorNet, Francis Phillips wrote \\"The book leaves one with the impression that it is a somewhat hotchpotch compendium of views and articles already well rehearsed by the author‚Äîthough nonetheless true for all that. What is disheartening is his bleak attitude towards human nature; having diagnosed the disease he is at a loss to suggest a remedy\\".

The film is based on the 1964‚Äì1969 TV series Peyton Place and it was billed as a reunion movie. It first aired on NBC Monday Night at the Movies on October 3, 1977. It focuses on the mysterious deaths of Rodney Harrington and Allison MacKenzie, as well as a diabolical plot of a powerful person to ruin the community.Review Summary The New York Times  Plot  Stella Chernak (Stella Stevens) arrives at the Peyton Tower Hotel in Peyton Place after an absence of numerous years. She has returned to destroy the small town, and is able to use her power through Jay Kamens (Norman Burton), the president of the Peyton Mills and her trustee. Another former citizen returning to Peyton Place is Betty Anderson (Janet Margolin). Although she is now married to David Roerick (Edward Bell), she agreed to a secret meeting with her ex-husband Rodney Harrington near Peyton Place. Her friend Denise Haley (Charlotte Stewart) offers her a roof, despite her husband Stan Haley's (Jonathan Goldsmith) objections about her presence. Another resident dissatisfied with Betty's arrival is Constance MacKenzie (Dorothy Malone), who fears that Betty will interfere with Rodney's relationship with her daughter Allison MacKenzie. Betty sneaks out of the Haley house at night to meet with Rodney somewhere near Peyton Place, but witnesses the Winnebago crashing and exploding in which Rodney and Allison are driving. The town is in deep sorrow when it is revealed that Rodney and Allison have died. Rodney's brother Norman Harrington (Christopher Connelly), now married to Jill (Joyce Jillson), refuses to accept that Rodney and Allison have died because of drunk driving, which the police have concluded after finding alcohol in the RV. Along with Betty and lawyer Steven Cord (David Hedison), Norman starts an investigation to find out what really happened on the night when Rodney and Allison died. He is unaware that Jill's family is somehow involved with the origins of the car accident, and her father Bo Buehler (Royal Dano) even witnessed the car crash. The research endangers both Steven and Betty's marriage; Steven's wife Carla (Linda Gray) suspects that he is somehow involved with Betty after he was out all night, and Betty's husband David does not understand why she is staying in Peyton Place. Betty's marriage is saved; Steven and Carla's fate together remains uncertain. Norman, Betty and Steven eventually conclude that the powerful company New Star Corporation is trying to take over Peyton Place by sabotaging the town's water supply. In the hospital, Constance and her husband Elliot Carson (Tim O'Connor) are brought in to identify the bodies. Elliot claims that the girl on the table is not Allison, after which doctor Tommy Crimpton (James Booth) is held responsible and gets fired by Ellen Considine (Marj Dusay). Ellen is the secretary and lover of doctor Michael Rossi (Ed Nelson), who has come to town to hide a dark secret from the past involving her teenage son Andy (Christopher S. Nelson). Andy feels attracted to Jill's younger sister Bonnie (Kimberly Beck), who in her turn is blackmailed by lovestruck teen Billie Kaiserman (David Kyle) due to her affair with Stan. Meanwhile, Norman hires a musician named Springer (Kaz Garas) to find out who is the head of New Star Corporation. Springer breaks in its office, and while going through documents, he finds out that Stella is the boss of New Star Corporation, and that two days before their death, Rodney and Allison went through the same documents. Springer tries to warn Norman about this, but he is shot by Stella's servant Tristan (Robert Deman) before he can. Hereafter, Stella allows Elliot's request for an inquest, because she is certain that some of the medical examiners hired by her will give the court a false death cause. The examiners were able to interfere due to Crimpton blackmailing Ellen with the information that Andy has spent three years in a hospital for the criminally insane for arson. Stella was not aware, though, that Dr. Rossi examined the bodies himself and found out that Rodney and Allison were shot to death. Afterwards, Steven orders a warrant for Stella. Stella is, along with Crimpton and other accomplices, in the Peyton Tower Hotel, where they are keeping Jill as a hostage. Norman receives a threat note to sabotage the inquest if he wants to see his wife ever again. Instead, he and Michael set out to the Peyton Tower Hotel, where they try to stop Stella. It results in a major fight, during which Stella falls to her death from the balcony.

Production Based on the prime time soap opera that aired from 1964 to 1969, Murder in Peyton Place brought back original cast members Dorothy Malone, Ed Nelson, Tim O'Connor, Joyce Jillson, and Christopher Connelly. Barbara Parkins declined an offer to reprise her role of Betty Anderson, and Lee Grant (Stella Chernak in the original series) and James Douglas (Steven Cord in the original series) had commitments to other projects. Producer Peter Katz did not approach Mia Farrow and Ryan O'Neal to return as Allison MacKenzie and Rodney Harrington, because he \\"didn't think they would be interested.\\" Farrow and O'Neal, by the time, had successful film careers, which kept them from making television appearances. Connelly admitted that he was not enthusiastic on returning as Norman Harrington, but he took the role anyway because otherwise he would be unoccupied: :\\"It was like going back while everyone else was moving on. Like Ryan and Mia and Lee. It was like going back and doing your first job over again. But I wasn't busy. It can only really do me good, which it has. The really strange thing was sitting around the set with the other original cast members and trying to figure out who was who. Trying to remember what character was married to who, who was the father. It became hysterical.\\"\\"'Peyton Place' Revisit Finds Cast in Hotbed of Confusion\\" by Jerry Buck, Milwaukee Sentinel, October 3, 1977. p. 2 Connelly recalled that the most positive aspect of the film was that, while filming, he made contacts that landed him the role of Mark Twain in another TV film, Incredible Rocky Mountain Race (1977). He signed on to the film in June 1977 along with Ed Nelson, and shortly after Tim O'Connor and Dorothy Malone were revealed as cast members.\\"Malone, O'Connor Signed for 'Murder in Peyton Place'\\", Los Angeles Times, June 10, 1977. Meanwhile, actor Christopher S. Nelson - son of other cast member Ed Nelson - was more positive on the film, which to him \\"felt like a homecoming.\\"\\"Chris Has Returned\\", The Herald Journal, August 4, 1979. p. 7 Another cast member more positive about the revisit was Malone, who was glad to show up on the set in Texas.\\"Dorothy Malone loved living in 'Peyton Place'\\", The Daily News, September 22, 1977. Reception Murder in Peyton Place received generally negative reviews, with the reviewer of the Los Angeles Times calling it \\"dull\\" and furthermore wrote: \\"Pretend that you're a network programmer and someone gives you this idea--a really crackerjack notion of how grand it would be to get the gang from Peyton Place together again.

He played college football at the University of Nevada-Reno. Early years Smerek attended Basic High School, where he was an All-state player in football. He also practiced basketball. He accepted a football scholarship from the University of Nevada-Reno, which was an NCAA Division II school. In 1978, the program moved up to Division I-AA. As a senior, he helped his team finished undefeated (11-0) in the regular season and was named All- Big Sky at defensive end. Professional career Smerek was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys after the 1980 NFL Draft. In training camp, he fractured his ribs and was placed on the injured reserve list. In 1981, he was moved to defensive tackle, but suffered a knee injury in the second game of the regular season and was placed on the injured reserve list. While being inactive, he had a traffic related argument and was shot in the chest. His physical fitness helped him survive the injury and return to play football the next season. In 1982, he was a starter for the Cowboys in the playoffs, replacing the injured John Dutton at left defensive tackle. He made his first career start in the playoffs against the Green Bay Packers, posting 10 tackles and one sack. In 1983, he began to substitute Dutton on passing downs, finishing with 6 sacks (fourth on the team) and 17 tackles. In 1984, although he played defensive tackle, head coach Tom Landry gave him the first shot at retired Harvey Martin's right defensive end position. But due to the holdout of Randy White, the team was forced to play him at right defensive tackle during the 4 preseason games, and he never received the opportunity to compete with Jim Jeffcoat for the starting position, nor was he able to catch up. He remained in his role of a pass rush specialist at left defensive tackle, registering 10 tackles and one sack. In 1985, he was competing for the left defensive tackle position, but suffered a right shoulder injury that forced him to miss training camp. He tried to play in the season opener against the Washington Redskins, but his shoulder wasn't strong enough and was placed on the injured reserve list on September 10. He returned after 6 games, making 2 sacks (came in his first game against the Atlanta Falcons) and would also match his career-high 17 tackles. In 1986, he missed the first 5 games of the season because of a sprained knee, registering 17 tackles and 4.5 sacks. In 1987, he was placed on the injured reserve list with a sprained knee, before being activated in October after the NFL players went on a strike, so he would start the 3 replacement games at defensive end. He saw most of his playing time in passing situations during the remainder of the season. He finished with 14 tackles (9 in the fifth game against the Washington Redskins). Smerek retired after being waived on August 23, 1988. He was one of the strongest players on the team and a productive backup as a pass rushing specialist. During his career he had a chance to earn a starting position on different occasions, but untimely injuries were his downfall.

She was later converted to a schooner barge and served as a consort for lumber hookers on the Great Lakes. She escaped destruction in a severe 1919 storm that sank her longtime companion, the SS Myron, only to sink on the traditional day of bad luck, Friday the 13th, 1921, with the loss of all hands. She came to rest on Lake Superior's bottom off Whitefish Point near the Myron. The Miztec‚Äôs wreck was illegally salvaged in the 1980s. Artifacts from the Miztec became the property of the State of Michigan after they were seized in a 1992 Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Environment (DNRE) raid on the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum. The State allows the museum to hold a triple sheave block and hook and a double sheave block and hook from the Miztec as a loan. Her wreck is now protected by the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve as part of an underwater museum. Career The 194 foot wooden Miztec was built as a 3-masted schooner in 1890 in Marine City, Michigan. She was enrolled at Port Huron, Michigan on 8 April 1890. On 3 May 1890 she ran ashore near Minorville, Wisconsin. The Miztec spent the final years of her career as an O.W. Blodgett Lumber Company barge consort towed by lumber hookers. She was stranded by her tow, the SS Myron, off Vermilion Point in a severe November gale in 1919. She narrowly escaped total destruction and suffered heavy damage but survived the storm while the Myron did not. She was rebuilt in 1919. Final voyage The Blodgett fleet of the Zillah, Miztec, and Peshtigo locked through the Soo headed for a spring gale and the Miztec‚Äôs doom on Friday 13 May 1921. The wooden steamer Zillah was towing the schooner barges Miztec and Peshtigo. The Zillah and Miztec carried bulk salt bound for Duluth, Minnesota and the empty Peshtigo was scheduled for drop off at Munising, Michigan. Ten miles west of Whitefish Point, the fleet met the full brunt of the storm's heavy snow and near hurricane force winds. The 31-year-old wooden Zillah started taking on water when her seams twisted open in the raging seas. Her 785-horsepower steam engine could barely maintain her bow to the seas. The master of the Zillah decided to turn around and take shelter in Whitefish Bay. The Zillah‚Äôs tow line broke during the strain of the turn, stranding the Miztec and Peshtigo in the storm, and then the tow line between the two barges broke. In an effort to reach the lee of Whitefish Point, the Peshtigo set short sails that the wind soon shredded. The Peshtigo dragged both anchors as the wind and waves forced her toward shore, and the pounding surf of the dangerous shallows. When the crew of the Vermilion Point Life-saving Station saw the Peshtigo‚Äôs struggle, they launched two surfboats that were destroyed by the crashing sea. The Peshigo‚Äôs anchors finally caught hold about ¬º mile from shore and she and her crew survived the storm. When the tow line between the Miztec and the Peshtigo broke, Captain Campbell of the Peshtigo saw the Miztec‚Äôs lights disappear with his brother on board. His brother was the Miztec‚Äôs first mate. While the Miztec survived the 1919 storm that took her partner, the SS Myron, her run of good fortune ended when she sank with the loss of all 7 crewmembers on the traditional day of bad luck, Friday the 13th. Captain Neal, who was rescued near-death clinging to the pilothouse of the Myron in 1919, was serving as the Zillah's first mate when the Miztec sank in 1921. When the freighter Renown came upon the flotsam of the Miztec‚Äôs sinking site, its crew sighted a body atop the deck house, but unlike Captain Neal's rescue, the body slipped into the seas as they approached. The Renown reported their finding to the United States Coast Guard. The Coast Guard went to the wreck scene and buoyed the Miztec‚Äôs spar that was protruding from shallow water with plans to dynamite her as a navigational hazard as she lay near the shipping lane, but they were unable to relocate her when they returned. It was believed that as her salt cargo dissolved, she moved along the lake bottom to deeper water. The Miztec came to rest not far from the wreck site her longtime companion lumber hooker, the SS Myron. No bodies were recovered from the Miztec‚Äôs sinking site, but six days after she sank, Native Americans on Maple Island, Ontario discovered the body of Mrs. Florence Pederson, the cook and the wife of the captain of the Miztec. The Miztec was an estimated $10,000 loss to O.W. Blodgett Lumber Company. Wreck The Miztec‚Äôs wreck was discovered in 1983 by the Oddessey Foundation in of water at . The Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Environment (DNRE) raided the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum at Whitefish Point in 1992 for artifacts illegally removed from the Great Lakes bottomlands. The DNRE seized around 150 artifacts from the museum, including a triple sheave block and hook and a double sheave block and hook from the Miztec. Following a settlement agreement between the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society and the State of Michigan, the State's artifacts from the Miztec are on loan to the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society for display in the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum. The Miztec‚Äôs wreck is now protected by the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve for future generations of scuba divers. The Miztec‚Äôs remains are broken and scattered on the lake bottom but her anchor and chain and other gear are still present. Although the Miztec‚Äôs wreck is one of the shallower wrecks, sports divers are cautioned to be certain of their abilities and equipment for dives because the preserve does not include protective bay or coves from the cold and volatile weather. Divers who visit the wreck sites are expected to observe preservation laws and \\"take nothing but pictures and leave nothing but bubbles.\\" Notes References    Category:1890 ships Category:Merchant ships of the United States Category:Maritime incidents in 1921 Category:Shipwrecks of Lake Superior Category:Schooners of the United States Category:Barges of the United States Category:Schooner barges Category:Ships built in Michigan ","title":"Miztec (schooner barge)"},{"id":"28288217","text":"Diana Marshall is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Jane Badler. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 22 June 2010. Badler had a four-month contract with the show and she began filming her first scenes in April following a successful audition. Badler revealed that the writers are fans of the 1983 television miniseries V, which she starred in, and wrote the role of Diana with her in mind. They named the character Diana in a homage to the role she played in the show. The character departed on 20 September 2010. Diana is an ambitious, driven businesswoman who works for Lassiter's International. She arrives in Erinsborough from New York on a business trip and decides to try to take control of the company. She also wants to get revenge on the former lover who broke her heart, Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis). Diana wants to get to the top, but Paul stands in her way as his place within the company is secure. However, Diana discovers that Paul has been embezzling money and uses this to get what she wants. Diana clashes with many of the other Erinsborough residents and she is not well liked. She is described as a \\"villainess\\", a \\"dangerous femme fatale\\" and a woman on a mission. Diana sleeps with Paul, despite the fact that he is married and she becomes a suspect following an attempt on his life. Badler and Diana were well received by critics. Character creation and casting In March 2010, it was announced that Badler had joined the cast of Neighbours as \\"super-bitch\\" Diana Marshall. Badler said that when she met with the writers, they told her that they are big fans of V and so they wrote the part of Diana with her in mind. They named the character Diana in a homage to the role she played in V. The writers did not know that Badler was living in the county until a chance meeting brought them together. Badler revealed that the guitarist in her band managed to connect her to Neighbours' executive producer, Susan Bower and when she tried to get her music featured on the show, she was asked to play Diana instead. Badler said that she still had to audition for the role, which she said was \\"depressing\\" as she hates auditioning. However, she said it was fun as the part was for a bad girl, which is the kind of role she enjoys playing. She added \\"Now I'm happy that I had to earn the role; I feel as though it was made for me.\\" Badler had a four-month guest contract with the show and she began filming her first scenes in April which were due to air in June 2010. Badler admitted that filming her first scenes were hard and she \\"could not get it together\\". She said \\"I noticed a few of the other new people. They all went through the same thing, where you have a day where you just go, 'Wow, I can't seem to function!'\\". Badler also said that occasionally there were no rehearsals and that it was \\"very daunting\\" and challenging. She added that the cast were \\"really nice\\" and that she got used to the quick pace of filming. Badler's debut episode aired on 22 June 2010. When Badler was asked if the door would be left open for Diana to return, she said \\"Oh yes, absolutely. I was contracted for four months and the way that it ended is very up in the air and I'm sure that they will use me whenever they need to shake things up a bit, you know\\". Character development =Characterisation= Before Diana made her first appearance, she was being described as being a \\"mega bitch\\", an \\"Erinsborough villainess\\" and a \\"manipulative businesswoman.\\" Diana is a dangerous femme fatale, who is \\"beautiful, sexy and strong\\". TV Soap said she is a woman on a mission. Badler described her character's background saying she had a dysfunctional upbringing, which made her strong and a fighter. Diana has had to fight for everything in her life, so she works hard in order to survive. Badler added in an interview with Network Ten that Diana is highly ambitious and very driven, which makes her kind of like a man. Diana is one of the chiefs of Lassiter's International, but she knows that she will not get to the top of the company because Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) is the heir to the Robinson fortune. Diana arrives in Erinsborough from New York, on a business trip and she decides that she wants to try to take control of the company. Diana clashes with many other Erinsborough residents and she is not well liked because she is abrupt and does not hide her ambition to bring people down. Diana can be very charming and this hides the fact that she is looking after herself and her interests. Of this, Badler said \\"She is the smiling assassin, but she's irresistible as she has the wit, the brain and the moves to get away with it!\\" To go with her job and personality, Diana has a glamorous wardrobe, which Badler said is the complete opposite of hers. Badler explained that Diana is more conservative as she wears much beige, silver and grey, with Cartier watches. She added \\"There are many power suits and stilettos!\\" =Relationship with Paul Robinson= As well as trying to take over Lassiter's, Diana also wants to \\"settle a score with Paul Robinson\\". Paul stands in her way of achieving her goal as his place within the company is secure for life as Diana's boss, Rosemary Daniels (Joy Chambers), is Paul's aunt. Badler explained that Diana resents Paul as she is not part of his family and knows that she cannot ever be at the top. Further to that, Paul and Diana were once lovers and Diana fell in love with him, but he walked out on her and broke her heart. Stefan Dennis said that Paul and Diana's relationship came at a time when Paul was \\"a philandering playboy and didn't care.\\" Paul became one of a few men that Diana has ever fallen in love with and because he treated her badly, she decides to bring him down. Badler said that Diana has been keeping an eye on Paul and knows everything about what he has been up to. Following her arrival, Diana begins to make Paul's life \\"a nightmare\\" and Badler said \\"Diana's back to force him to fall in love with her again, or destroy him ‚Äì whichever comes first\\". Diana uses Paul's son and stepson to help her plan along. Declan Napier (Erin Mullally) gives Diana inside info about Paul embezzling as he believes he is doing the right thing. Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith) tries to bond with Diana by giving her company information and Diana discovers the extent of Paul's money problems and knows that she has enough details to ruin him. Paul realises that Diana knows the truth and offers to join forces with her to bring down Rosemary instead. Diana becomes friends with Paul's wife, Rebecca (Jane Hall), and she realises that she can \\"shatter Paul's marriage\\" as Rebecca does not suspect anything is wrong. Badler said \\"There is all this history between Paul and Diana and now they seem to be dancing around each other. There's every chance they could catch fire again. Diana is so charming and when people meet her they think she is lovely ‚Äì but she really is not. And that's what makes her even more of a superbitch.\\" Diana asks Paul to prove to her how far he is prepared to go to create an alliance between them and to prove his loyalty he proposes that they sleep together. Diana suspects that Paul is not being genuine, but Paul insists that he is and describes Rebecca as \\"collateral damage.\\" Paul believes that sleeping with Diana is the only option he has got to keep her on side. Dennis added that Paul feels guilty when he takes off his wedding ring and terrible about betraying Rebecca. Badler said that the situation is an \\"ego thing\\" for Diana and afterwards she makes it clear that her plans to destroy Paul have not changed. Badler said she enjoyed working with Stefan Dennis and said he is \\"fantastic\\" and that she felt comfortable with him. She said \\"I kind of felt like it was a well-played tennis match ‚Äì every time you zing him something, he zings it right back. He's right there for you, so I absolutely loved working with him. =Who Pushed P.R?= In July 2010, it was revealed that the 6000th episode of Neighbours would see Paul pushed from the mezzanine of Lassiter's Hotel. This then kicks off a whodunit storyline with Diana being one of six suspects. Susan Bower said that as the Neighbours team was developing the storyline, they decided to add to the story that Paul's financial situation leads to him embezzling, which in turn leads to Diana arriving. Badler said it was \\"great\\" to be involved in the storyline and said she was largely featured in the 6000th episode. Diana becomes a suspect in the attempt on Paul's life because he jilts her \\"in the boardroom and the bedroom\\". Paul then humiliates Diana and sends her packing from Lassiter's. On Diana's reason to kill Paul, Badler said \\"Seeing her name splashed across the Erinsborough News prompts Diana to pull out all the stops in order to bring Paul down. And she still has friends in high places!\\" Diana is seen placing a call asking for something to be taken care of and she hands money over to a stranger just before Paul is pushed. Following the attempt on Paul's life, Diana's earring is found at the scene and the police manage to catch her at the airport before she returns to America. Diana diverts the police attention to Rebecca by telling them that she revealed Paul's affair to her. Storylines Declan Napier calls Diana to tell her that some money has gone missing from the Lassiter's Hotel account and Diana arrives in Erinsborough. She goes to Charlie's for a drink and Declan calls her and says that the situation with the money was down to a software glitch. Diana see Paul Robinson arrive and she goes over to him. Paul introduces her to Declan and Diana tells him that if there is any dirt to be found on Paul, she will find it. Paul later introduces Diana to his son, Andrew, and his wife, Rebecca. Rebecca invites Diana for dinner and Diana asks to meet Declan to discuss why he called her. Diana reveals to Declan that she knows that Paul has been embezzling money from the company. Andrew becomes jealous of Declan and Diana's bond and he gives Diana some of Paul's financial papers when he tells her about his business idea. Diana calls Rosemary Daniels and tells her that she has evidence of Paul's embezzlement. Rosemary asks Diana to keep her updated on the situation. Paul asks Diana to join him in taking over the company and to prove his loyalty, he goes to Diana's hotel room and sleeps with her. Diana hides a camera in the room and after Paul leaves she checks the tape, but finds Paul has wiped the footage. Diana tries to sabotage an event being held at Rebecca's bar, by taking all of the security for a conference at Lassiter's. Declan pleads with Diana to help his mother out, but Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) solves the problem instead. Diana arrives in Erinsborough to try to take over the Lassiter's company. Diana asks Paul's lawyer, Toadfish Rebecchi (Ryan Moloney), to work for her in bringing Paul down and he agrees. Diana discovers that Paul is blackmailing Toadie into covering up his embezzlement. Paul tells Diana that he has sold PirateNet and that his money troubles will soon be over, before giving her cab fare to the airport. Diana tells Rosemary that she was the one who secured the deal to sell PirateNet and that she did the deal to protect Paul. Rosemary is grateful and tells Diana that she will book her a flight home. Diana asks Paul to come to her hotel room and she tries to seduce him, but he pushes her away. Diana tells him that she is not going anywhere and that she will take everything from him. Paul goads Diana when she comes into Charlie's, he tells her that it was fun crushing her and Diana throws her drink in Paul's face. Diana is about to go home, when she hears that Paul has decided to put Declan in charge of Lassiter's for six months, so he can spend more time with his family. Diana asks Declan to help her bring Paul and Rosemary down and he agrees. Diana begins calling the board members in the hope that she can persuade them to vote Rosemary and Paul out. Paul discovers that Toadie and Declan are working against him and he tells Rosemary about Diana's plan. Diana goes to Declan's office and finds Paul waiting for her. He tells her that her plan has not worked and that Rosemary has fired her. Diana discovers that Paul has written a story about her in his newspaper and she confronts him. Diana tells him that she will receive many job offers in New York, but Paul says that no one will be interested as she is toxic. Diana's plane ticket is cancelled and she is thrown out of the hotel by Paul. She asks Declan for help and he tells her that Paul keeps his business papers in the home safe. Diana kisses Paul, and at the same time she takes his house keys from his pocket and she breaks into his house. Diana does not find anything and, in anger, she smashes Paul's possessions. Diana calls a mystery person and arranges for them to hurt Paul. She then goes to Rebecca and tells her about her husband's affair. Someone goes to the Lassiter's mezzanine and pushes Paul from it. Detective Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) discovers one of Diana's earrings at the scene and he stops her at the airport. During questioning, Diana tells him to speak to Rebecca again after revealing her affair with Paul. Andrew, Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas) and Natasha Williams (Valentina Novakovic) follow Diana and see her meeting with Jack Ward (Peter Lowrey), a hitman she called on the night Paul was pushed. Natasha retrieves Jack's phone and the group listen to a message left by Diana, telling him to leave town. Andrew confronts Diana at her hotel and Mark arrives to arrest her for conspiracy to commit murder. Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) receives some emails telling her that Diana did not push Paul and she goes to see her. Diana tells Susan that she has been formally charged, but insists that she is innocent. She realises that Susan believes her and she begs Susan to help. Diana is later released. After Paul wakes up and mentions that he argued with Diana, an anonymous caller informs Diana of what Paul said and she begins packing. Mark and his team arrive at her hotel, but they find the room is empty. Diana goes to the hospital to see Paul, he tries to call for help, but he is too weak. Diana tells him that she did not push him, but if she did, he would be in the morgue. She asks him to tell the truth and do the right thing, before leaving through the side entrance of the room. Reception Badler's co-star, Mullally, praised her appearance in Neighbours. He said that \\"she has so much intensity on screen and sometimes she'll throw in some interesting comedy as well\\". He added \\"She is great to work with, so beautiful, really happy and chirpy. And when she goes on screen she plays this callous, powerful, intimidating persona and her eyes just go straight through you!\\" TV Week said that they have been \\"desperate\\" to see Neighbours cast a new female villain and that their prayers had been answered when Badler joined the cast as Diana. Television critic, Andrew Mercado, said that Neighbours had made its \\"best casting decision in years\\" when they asked Badler to join the show. He hoped that she would be around for a while and he added the show \\"desperately needs a bitch right now\\". Mercado later compared Diana and Paul to Australia's Prime Minister Julia Gillard and her predecessor Kevin Rudd. He said \\"Arrogant men rarely see wily women sneaking up from behind to stab them in the back. Kevin Rudd has just been forced to stand aside as Australian Prime Minister to avoid an embarrassing defeat at the hands of Deputy Leader Julia Gillard and now Neighbours' Paul Robinson could be the next to go with a celebrated 80's superbitch infiltrating Ramsay Street\\". Ruth Deller of television website Lowculture said Diana was a \\"fabulous plot device\\".

It is a transitional zone or region between the predominantly coniferous Boreal Forest and the mostly deciduous broadleaf forest region further south. Location and climate The ecoregion includes most of the southern Canadian Shield in Ontario and Quebec north and west of the Saint Lawrence River lowlands. The portion in Northeastern Ontario includes the eastern shores of Lake Superior, Greater Sudbury, North Bay, Ontario, Lake Nipissing, the Clay Belt and Temagami. Areas in Central Ontario include Muskoka, Parry Sound, Algonquin Park, and Haliburton. The Quebec portion takes in Lake Timiskaming, the southern Laurentian Mountains, Quebec City, the Saguenay River, and Saguenay, Quebec. There is a separate section of the ecoregion in the Adirondack Mountains in upper New York State, United States. However the higher elevations of the Laurentian Mountains and the northern Appalachian Mountains in Canada constitute the Eastern Canadian forests ecoregion. The region has a humid continental climate consisting of warm summers and cold, snowy winters, and is warmer towards the south. Flora The flora in this ecoregion varies considerably based on soil conditions and elevation. These mixed forests are distinct from the deciduous forests south of the Canadian Shield and the cooler boreal forests to the north. =Conifer swamp= Conifer swamps occur in areas that are seasonally flooded. Trees can be very dense or sparse; mats of sphagnum moss cover the ground. Black spruce (Picea mariana) and tamarack (Larix laricina) are the predominant tree species. Where the soil is not saturated year round grows northern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis). Speckled alder (Alnus incana) grows around the edges of these swamps and red spruce (Picea rubens) and white pine (Pinus strobus) grow on higher, drier ground. =Lowland conifer forests= Lowland conifer forests occur on flats, low ridges, and knolls near bodies of water. They are dominated by balsam fir (Abies balsamea) and red spruce, although white pine and paper birch (Betula papyrifera) also occur. The ground is often stony with little vegetation. =Hardwood‚Äìconifer mixed forests= Hardwood‚Äìconifer mixed forests occur in a transition zone between lowland conifer and northern hardwood forests. The ground is less rocky than in the lowland conifer forests and thus supports more vegetation. Trees include red spruce, balsam fir, eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), red maple (Acer rubrum), and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis). The understory vegetation is abundant, with witchhobble (Viburnum lantanoides), honeysuckle (Lonicera spp.), and striped maple (Acer pensylvanicum). The herbaceous layer include common wood sorrel (Oxalis spp.), bunchberry (Cornus canadensis), yellow clintonia (Clintonia borealis), ferns, and mosses. =Northern hardwood forests= Northern hardwood forests occur on the richest, most productive soils. Sugar maple (Acer saccharum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), and yellow birch are the predominant tree species. In secondary forests, red spruce, white pine, white ash (Fraxinus americana), eastern hemlock, black cherry (Prunus serotina), and red maple are present. Witchhobble (Viburnum alnifolium) is a common understory shrub. Ferns and clubmosses grow in the herbaceous layer, along with numerous species of spring-flowering forbs. =Upper slope hardwood‚Äìconifer mixed forests= Upper slope hardwood‚Äìconifer mixed forests are an area of transition between the northern hardwood and the mountain conifer forests. They are similar to hardwood‚Äìconifer forests, but with no red maple. Red spruce and eastern hemlock, together with sugar maple, yellow birch, and American beech are the dominant species, with scattered white pine. =Mountain conifer forests= Red spruce and balsam fir are common at lower elevations of the mountain conifer forests. Hardwoods that grow among the conifers include paper birch, yellow birch, and American mountain-ash (Sorbus americana). With increasing elevation, balsam fir becomes more abundant. Near treeline, black spruce joins balsam fir in the krummholz. Herbaceous plants include wood sorrel, bunchberry, yellow clintonia, and spinulose woodfern (Dryopteris carthusiana). Mosses and lichens cover exposed rocks. =Alpine= Rocks are exposed and covered with lichens and mosses. Low-lying plants more common in the tundra to the north grow here. They include gold-colored deer‚Äôs hair (Trichophorum cespitosum), alpine bilberry (Vaccinium uliginosum), lapland rosebay (Rhododendron lapponicum), bearberry willow (Salix uva-ursi), mountain sandwort (Minuartia groenlandica), and alpine holygrass (Hierochloe alpina). In the Adirondacks, these communities are limited to on 11 peaks. Fauna Old-growth forest such as the pinewoods found in this ecoregion are home to a complex variety of long-established wildlife including many invertebrates and reptiles and birds such as American black duck (Anas rubripes), wood duck (Aix sponsa), hooded merganser (Lophodytes cucullatus), and pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus). Mammals found here include the North American cougar (Puma concolor), moose (Alces alces), American black bear, Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis), snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), wolf (Canis lupus), coyote (Canis latrans), porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). The Lake Nipissing area in particular is home to eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus), mourning dove (Zenaida macroura), northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), and wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina). Hautes-Gorges-de-la-Rivi√®re-Malbaie National Park in Quebec. Threats and preservation These forests have been severely damaged by centuries of clearance for timber, roads, agricultural and urban development. This development now includes ski facilities, while logging and mining are ongoing. Protected areas include: Papineau-Labelle Wildlife Reserve, Mont-Tremblant, Jacques-Cartier, Hautes-Gorges-de-la-Rivi√®re-Malbaie and La Mauricie National Parks in Quebec; Algonquin Provincial Park, Lake Superior Provincial Park, Lady Evelyn-Smoothwater Provincial Park, French River Provincial Park, Killarney Provincial Park and a number of parks in Algoma District in Ontario; and Adirondack Park in New York. Adirondack Park contains the largest areas of original red pine and eastern white pine in the world and one of the largest areas of original forest in the United States, the Five Ponds Wilderness Area.

Henry Gerber, founder of the Society for Human Rights, started publishing the newsletter using his personal typewriter. The purpose of the newsletter was to act as a forum of discussion among gay men. The first issue of the newsletter was published in 1924, and a total of only two issues were published. Friendship and Freedom was the first known gay-interest periodical in the United States. This periodical, along with Jim Kepner's Gay Fan and Lisa Ben's Vice Versa, is described by author of LGBT-issues James Thomas Sears as \\"amateurish\\". The title of the magazine, Friendship and Freedom, was directly translated from a 1920s German gay magazine, Freundschaft und Freiheit. In the 1920s, the United States was less progressive compared to contemporary Germany, where many gay rights organization flourished during this period. As a result, Gerber's room in a boardinghouse was raided by the Chicago Police Department in July 1925, and everything associated with the publication of the newsletter, including Gerber's typewriter and his personal diaries, were seized. Gerber was thrown into jail for three days and the news of his arrest was published in the contemporary press with the headlines, \\"Strange Sex Cult Exposed.\\" All copies of Friendship and Freedom that were not in circulation were seized by the police and destroyed. No copy of Friendship and Freedom survives today. Despite lack of any existing copy, the existence of this publication was verified by American LGBT historian Jonathan Ned Katz through a photograph published by sexologist and LGBT-rights advocate Magnus Hirschfeld in 1927 depicting homosexual publications, among them Friendship and Freedom.

A wanderer and a sailor at first, he drifted in his travels to Tonga, where he became a Christian. Life In 1835, Mateinaniu helped William Cross and David Cargill in their linguistic preparations for the mission to Fiji. He became a preacher and came back to his own land with Cross and Cargill, and was himself a most important factor in the missionary impact made on Lakeba from the start. He went ahead of the first missionaries to Somosomo, and preached there with some success among the Tongans, who were in the service of Tui Cakau at that time, thus making it possible for Hunt and Lyth, to establish that station. Of Mateinaniu, Cargill wrote the following in his wife, Margaret's memoirs: He preached in Bau regularly, long before it was really opened to white missionaries. At the time of Hunt's death, he was stationed at Viwa; he and his wife personally cared for Hunt's family during the long weeks of that final illness. One of the four houses at Lelean Memorial School, a Methodist church secondary school located at Davuilevu, Nausori, is named in honour of Mateinaniu.

Topologically it lies between chalk downs to the north- east, and downland with Grovely Wood to the southwest. The village straddles the A36 road and is on the left bank of the River Wylye, which defines much of the western boundary of the parish; the eastern boundary follows the A360 Salisbury-Devizes road. The parish includes the village of Stoford (not to be confused with Stoford, Somerset) and the hamlets of Little Wishford and Chilhampton. History There is scant evidence of significant prehistoric habitation in South Newton. There has been a settlement in the village since Saxon times and South Newton is largely a 10th-century estate which stretched from the River Wylye to the ridge of the hills to the north-east. The village originated at about the same time as its three neighbours Stoford, Chilhampton and Little Wishford, each village having a strip of land down to the river and up onto the downland of the drainage area. In 1086 the Domesday survey recorded 42 households at Newenton or Newentone. The ancient parish had a detached part at North Ugford, on the other side of the Wylye and bounded to the south by the Nadder. This area (now farmland, and the hamlet of Ugford on the A30) was by 1884 divided between Burcombe and Wilton parishes. Various other portions have been ceded to other parishes during the last 150 years. About south of the church is an ancient watermill on the banks of the River Wylye. In 1837 the workhouse for the Wilton poor law union was built in the far south of the parish, next to what is now the A36 in the area called Burden's Ball (now in Wilton parish). The three-storey building in red brick accommodated 280, in a cruciform plan similar to workhouses designed by Sampson Kempthorne. The railway between Salisbury and Westbury, completed in 1856, runs on the opposite side of the Wylye. Wishford station at Great Wishford was about northwest of South Newton. The station was closed in 1955 but the railway remains open as part of the Wessex Main Line. Parish church The Church of England parish church of Saint Andrew is at the east end of the village and is constructed largely of rubblestone with ashlar dressing, and some flint and stonework chequering. In 1861‚Äì2 the church underwent radical reconstruction to designs by T.H. Wyatt but the chancel retains some 13th-century features. The three-stage west tower was rebuilt in the 14th century. In 1553 it had four bells, two of which are survive as the current tenor and second bell. They were cast by the Salisbury foundry, one in about 1400 and the other in about 1499. The present tenor bell was cast by John Wallis of Salisbury in 1610. The bells that complete the current ring of six were cast by John Warner of Cripplegate in London: one in 1862 and the treble and second bell in 1887, the year of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. In 1992 the parish became part of the Wylye and Till Valley benefice, which is today a group of eight village parishes. Local economy The village has a small light industrial estate containing about 10 businesses. Nearby is a large building and maintenance company. The village also has a large neuro- physiological rehabilitation nursing home. These companies provide significant local employment. Social amenities The village has a public house, The Bell Inn. South Newton has a cricket club and a junior football club.

He wrote more than 20 plays and was involved in the writing and directing of some 25 others. Many of his plays had a political and human rights message during the one party state under Banda. He was the son of the prominent Malawian activist and politician Dunduzu Chisiza. Early life Chisiza was the third son of Dunduzu K. Chisiza, a prominent activist of Malawian Independence who was killed in 1962 six months before Du's birth. His uncle, Yatuta Chisiza, was also a nationalist involved in politics, serving as bodyguard to Banda during the struggle for independence. He was killed following independence during an attempted take-over of the Presidency in 1967. Chisiza became interested in drama at the Henry Henderson Institute in Blantyre as a secondary school student. He wrote and directed 'The Deceased's Attack', which won first prize at the National Schools Drama Festival in 1982. He later moved to the US and was awarded a BFA in Performing Arts at the Philadelphia College of the Performing Arts. He also became a martial arts enthusiast obtaining a black belt and becoming an instructor at the Philadelphia Arts Centre. He returned to Malawi soon after graduation. Wakhumbata Workshop Theatre In 1983, he formed the Wakhumbata Workshop Theatre before he went to the U.S. Wakhumbata in Chichewa and Tumbuka means among them \\"one who hugs\\", \\"one who hatches eggs\\" and \\"those who grieve\\". This workshop helped develop the performing arts in Malawi. After Du Chisiza's death from an AIDS related illness the theatre was led by Gertrude Webster Kamkwatira. Author and playwright Du Junior was Malawi's best known playwright. He wrote about controversial topics in Malawi during one party rule and during multi party rule. He was a fearless writer that dared to write about controversial topics that many would not dare to during the Banda regime. One of his popular works includes Fragments, which he produced after he returned from the U.S. and after learning that he would need to do much of his work abstract in order to get his message across without being banned. Another play, Tatuya Futi was a tribute to his uncle Yatuta Chisiza. Other plays include Papa's Empire, Phumashakire, De Summer Blow, Sir Daniels, Storm On Litada, Operation Tidy, Kabuha Tragedy, Mitsidi Burning, Black Cross, Black Blawizo, and Democracy Boulevard. He was best known for his abstract themed political plays but continued to write and produce during his political career. Political career His plays ranged over a variety of controversial issues that led to some of them being banned by the Banda regime. He began to use artistic talent to disguise his themes. He became very popular for his works of political criticism. In a surprising move, in 1993, he agreed to take on the post of Minister for Sports, Youth and Culture in one of Banda's last cabinets before multiparty elections in 1994. His play Democracy Boulevard commented on the abuses associated with the democratic process, it was particularly hard hitting on the media coverage associated with a multi-party democracy. In the months preceding the first multi-party elections, he was courted by each of the three major political parties. He announced his withdrawal from active politics in 1994 after the MCP was defeated. In 1998 he joined the ruling party, UDF. He announced his candidacy to stand as parliamentary candidate for Karonga South but died prior to the elections.

University of Michigan In 1935, Janke enrolled at the University of Michigan, where he studied geological engineering. He played at the tackle position for the Michigan Wolverines football team from 1936 to 1938. At the start of the 1937 season, Michigan head coach Harry Kipke moved Janke from the tackle position to fullback,(\\"This year Coach Harry Kipke has pulled Fred Janke out of a tackle post and moved him into the backfield as fullback.\\") but Janke returned to the tackle position by early October 1937.

As Janke played through his injuries, Crisler called him \\"the ideal team leader.\\" Writing for the Detroit Free Press, former Michigan quarterback Tod Rockwell credited Janke and Tom Harmon with creating a winning team under new line coach \\"Biggie\\" Munn. Rockwell wrote, \\"Janke belleves that no job on the team is as important as his. He is determined to be the best football player on the squad. He is fully cognizant of the responsibilities of a captain.

He also coached football at St. John High School in Jackson. Janke enlisted in the U.S. Navy during World War II and was stationed in the Philippines. After the war, Janke returned to coaching at St. John's High School in Jackson. He later took a job at Macklin Grinding Wheels.

It was established for the indigenous Kalinago people who inhabited the region prior to European colonization and settlement. The Kalinago Territory was officially formed by British colonial authorities in 1903, in a remote and mountainous area of Dominica's Atlantic coast. Its population remained largely isolated from the rest of the island throughout most of the 20th century, with only a ceremonial chief and no other formal self-governance. An incident later known as \\"the Carib War\\" escalated from a brief skirmish in the Territory in 1930, when law enforcement attempted to crack down on smuggling, to a political controversy ending with the abolition of the post of chief. The Chief was reinstated in 1952, and formalized local government was instituted the same year as part of an island-wide system. The \\"Carib Reserve Act\\", enacted the year of Dominica's independence in 1978, reaffirmed the Kalinago Territory's boundaries, its land management, and institutions of local government. In the last decades of the 20th century, modern utilities and infrastructure were finally introduced to the Kalinago Territory, which also established contacts with foreign governments and other indigenous peoples in the region. The present population of the Kalinago Territory is estimated around 3,000 Kalinago people. Legal residents share communal ownership of all land within the Territory. The Kalinago Territory has limited local government in the institutions of the Kalinago Council, and its head the Kalinago Chief, which are the equivalent in power of village councils and council chairpersons elsewhere in Dominica. The administrative centre is in Salybia, the largest of eight hamlets in the Kalinago Territory. A modern movement in the Kalingo Territory has supported the rediscovery and preservation of Kalinago culture. This has been fueled in part by Dominica's tourist industry. A model Kalinago village was established in the Territory in 2006. Cultural preservation groups stage performances at the model village and other locations, and practice traditional Kalinago crafts, such as making baskets and pottery, that are sold to tourists as souvenirs. Category 5 Hurricane Maria (which would later strike Puerto Rico) made a direct hit onto Kalinago Territory in September 2017 causing severe damage to the territory, leaving residents in need. Electricity, Internet, and wired telephone service became unavailable in the territory and were expected to remain so for several months. History =Establishment of the \\"Carib Reserve\\"= Dominica is the only Eastern Caribbean island that still has a population of pre-Columbian native Kalinago, who were exterminated or driven from neighbouring islands. The Kalinago on Dominica fought against the Spanish and later European settlers for two centuries. Over time, however, their population declined and they were forced into remote regions of the island as European settlers and imported African slaves grew in number on the island.. The first reservation of land for the Kalinago people occurred in 1763, when of mountainous land and rocky shoreline around Salybia, on the east coast, were set aside by British colonial authorities as part of the surveying of the island and its division into lots.; ; . A legend arose that this land was set aside by the request of Queen Charlotte, the wife of George III; from this another legend spread, and persisted among some Kalinago to the present, that Charlotte had set aside half of Dominica for the Kalinago people.. Later colonial officials were unable to locate any record of a title deed for the , however. (\\"...and it was probable that no such title had ever existed.\\"). European settlers continued attempts to turn the Kalinago lands into plantations through the end of the 18th century, but the Kalinago successfully held out, often with the assistance of runaway slaves.. In 1902, Henry Hesketh Bell, the Administrator of Dominica, sent a lengthy report to the Colonial Office on the state of the Kalinago people after he had visited its communities.; . The report was sent on July 26, 1902 to Secretary of State for the Colonies Joseph Chamberlain. He proposed that 3,700 acres (roughly 2% of Dominica's area) be set aside for the Kalinago, and that a Kalinago \\"chief\\" be officially recognized and given a token annual allowance of 6 pounds. Bell's proposals were adopted in 1903, formally establishing the \\"Carib Reserve\\".; ; . Its boundaries were announced in the Official Gazette of Dominica on 4 July 1903.. The Kalinago Chief was subsequently endowed with a silver-headed staff, and a ceremonial sash embroidered with \\"The Chief of the Caribs\\" in gothic lettering.; . At the time the \\"Carib Reserve\\" was established, the Kalinago population of around 400 was extremely isolated from the rest of Dominica, but the community appreciated the token symbols.. =\\"The Carib War\\"= The population of the \\"Carib Reserve\\" remained disconnected from the rest of Dominica, seldom seen and largely self-sustaining apart from some limited illegal trade with the neighboring French islands of Marie Galante and Martinique.; Hulme notes that it was easier for the Caribs to travel to other islands than it was the other side of Dominica, owing to the mountainous terrain. The colonial Administrator decided to crack down on this smuggling due to its impact on revenues, and in 1930, five armed policemen entered the Territory to seize smuggled goods and to arrest suspects.; see also for a more detailed account. When the police tried to seize a quantity of rum and tobacco and to take away suspects in Salybia, a crowd gathered in response and hurled stones and bottles. The police fired into the crowd, injuring four, of whom two later died. The police were beaten but managed to escape to Marigot, without having seized prisoners or contraband. The Administrator responded by summoning the Royal Navy light cruiser HMS Delhi to the coast, which fired star shells into the air and displayed searchlights along the shore; the Kalinago ran in fear from this display of force and hid in the woods. Marines landed to aid local police in the search for the perpetrators of the disturbance. Accurate news of the incident was difficult to come by, and rumors instead spread throughout the island of a Kalinago uprising. The Times incorrectly reported that Kalinago had looted and rioted in the capital, Roseau.. The incident is still hyperbolically known as \\"The Carib War.\\". Kalinago Chief Jolly John subsequently surrendered to authorities in Roseau and was charged, with five other Kalinago, with wounding the police officers and theft, though the prosecution fell apart by the following year.. A commission of inquiry was appointed in 1931 by the Governor of the Leeward Islands to investigate the 1930 incident and the situation of the Kalinago generally. The final report found fault on all sides. As a consequence for the Kalinago, the position of Chief was eliminated, the staff and sash were confiscated, and the former chief was forbidden to call himself \\"king.\\". =Local government and modern developments= The Administrator did not relent to Kalinago petitions for the restoration of the position of Chief until June 1952, when he personally conducted an investiture ceremony and presented the new chief with the staff and sash.. Later that year, the Kalinago Council was created as part of a system of local government for the whole island.; . The \\"Carib Reserve Act\\" was enacted in 1978, the year of Dominican independence. It reaffirmed the boundaries set in 1903, and legally established common ownership of land within the Kalinago Territory.. A broader consequence of the Act was a renewed interest in the distinctiveness of Kalinago identity and in Kalinago culture.. Though under the \\"Carib Reserve Act\\", the area was formerly referred to as the 'Carib Reserve', an amendment was approved and added in 2015 and the area's official name is now the Kalinago Territory.Dominica News Online, \\"Change from Carib to Kalinago now official\\" 2015 (\\"The reserve was renamed 'Carib Territory' by the Caribs themselves.\\"); (\\"This land became known as the Carib Reserve, and then, more recently, the Carib Territory.\\"); (\\"...the Carib Territory, as it is now popularly called...\\"). Considering the word \\"reserve\\" a relic of colonialism and exploitation, as well as negative connotations with the \\"Carib\\" (the root of the word 'cannibal'), given to them by European colonizers, Kalinago Territory residents urged the Dominica House of Assembly to officially change the name.Kalinago Reserve Act, Amendment (\\"The terminology 'Reserve', is a painful reminder of the horrors of colonial rule when native peoples were herded like cattle, and restricted to small unproductive areas of their own country, while the colonialists enriched themselves by exploiting the vast expanses of arable. As a mark of respect for the Carib population and a recognition of their historical and continuing contribution to the building of this nation, an appropriate gesture on the eve of the 21st century might be to erase that racist term from our Statute Books, once and for all.\\"). The Parliament of the Commonwealth of Dominica officially recognized the Kalinago's petition to change the name of \\"Carib Territory\\" to \\"Kalinago Territory\\". The name change applies to the Chief as well, who is now referred to as Kalinago Chief. The communities of the Kalinago Territory remained isolated into the late 20th century. A motorable road was not laid through the Territory until 1970; telephone service and electricity were established in the 1980s.. The Kalinago Territory was one of the last areas of Dominica to receive electricity, which began to be installed in 1986.. By 1990, 55% of Kalinago households still did not have access to electricity, and 85% of households did not live within 5 minutes of their nearest water supply.. The Kalinago people have remained possibly the poorest segment of the population of Dominica, which is in turn one of the poorest countries of the Lesser Antilles.. In the 1980s, the Kalinago Territory began to receive material, financial and ideological support from foreign governments, including the United States, Canada, and United Kingdom.. The Territory's leaders also reached out to other indigenous populations in the region, organizing a conference held in Saint Vincent; the Caribbean Organization of Indigenous Peoples was subsequently formed.. Successive Kalinago Chiefs also worked with the United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations.. Geography The Kalinago Territory is located in the north-east of Dominica, on the Atlantic (windward) coast. It comprises in Saint David Parish, within boundaries first established by colonial authorities in 1903, and reaffirmed in Articles 41 and 42 of the \\"Carib Reserve Act\\" in 1978.. The Dominican government may grant additional lands to the Territory, though it has never done so.Under Article 44 of the Carib Reserve Act; see . Most of the territory is uninhabited.. Though the Kalinago Territory adjoins Dominica's east coast, due to its rugged topography it only has two access points to the Atlantic Ocean, both of which are difficult landings.. The land is mostly of poor quality, with the worst soil erosion on Dominica, and deforestation that has destroyed many streams in the Territory.; attributes this to overuse as a consequence of the communal land ownership. further theorizes that this is because of rapid tenant turnover, which eliminates most incentives for long term land conservation. The Kalinago Council and police station are located in the hamlet of Salybia, the administrative center of the Kalinago Territory.. There are eight other hamlets in the Kalinago Territory: Bataka, Crayfish River, St Cyr, Gaulette River, Mahaut River, Sinecou, Concord and Salybia. Aside from small shops selling Kalinago crafts, these settlements, and the small farms surrounding them, do not differ significantly from the rest of Dominica. (\\"Visibly there is little to differentiate it from any other part of rural Dominica.\\"). Demographics The Kalinago Territory has an estimated population of around 3,000, which makes it the largest settlement of indigenous people in the Caribbean.. The Carib people themselves place the estimate higher, at between 3,500‚Äì4,000 as of 2009. . The population of the Kalinago Territory was only around 400 at the time of its formation in 1903.. This has grown over time, both in absolute numbers and in proportion to the total population of Dominica. In 1970, the population of the Kalinago Territory was 1.6% of Dominica's total population.. As of the 1991 government census, this had increased to 3.5%, with the population of the Kalinago Territory (including the nearby non-Kalinago village, Atkinson) counted at 2,518 people; this increase was reflected in a large proportion of young adults and children.. Residents of the Kalinago Territory are among the poorest in Dominica.. Territory residents are less educated, and have fewer work opportunities than other segments of the island's population.. Government and land management The Kalinago Council comprises five members and the presiding Kalinago Chief. Popular elections are held every five years. Notwithstanding the different titles, these institutions have the same powers and responsibilities as other village councils in Dominica, with the Kalinago Chief equal to a village council chairman. (\\"The council's power was defined as similar to the kind of authority that a Village Council in Dominica would receive\\"); (\\"Except for this title, [the Carib Chief] plays the same role as all the other Village Council chairmen in Dominica.\\") The Kalinago are also represented in the House of Assembly of Dominica as part of the Salybia constituency. Though its Representative has more power in practice, the Kalinago Chief is utilized more as a spokesperson for the Territory.. As established by Article 25(1) of the \\"Carib Reserve Act\\", all land within the Kalinago Territory is under the \\"sole custody, management and control\\" of the Kalinago Council and Chief.. No individuals can buy or sell parcels of land or encumber it as collateral. Kalinago residents instead have usufruct rights: they can claim vacant, unused land to work and build a home upon, subject to approval by the Kalinago Council.. Land left untended for more than a year is considered vacant and may be claimed.. Soil erosion and deforestation have been attributed to this common ownership, as the land is intensively used by a rapid succession of tenants.; . See also tragedy of the commons. Because of the usufruct rights over the communally held land, legal residency in the Territory is a significant issue. Under Article 51 of the \\"Carib Reserve Act\\", an individual becomes a legal resident and member of the Kalinago Territory community by birth; if at least one parent is Kalinago; or after 12 years of lawful residency within the Territory.. The latter criterion has been a target of criticism from the Kalinago people, who view it as a means by which non- Kalinago may appropriate their land.One Carib Council member was quoted as saying, \\"We did not agree with it but it was passed. Technically, what it is saying is, that after 12 years you are a Carib. That's magic.\\" . Culture and tourism Beginning in the late 20th century, the people of the Kalinago Territory have had a renewed interest in Kalinago culture and identity. This has been motivated in part by the tourism industry in Dominica, in the forms of both ecotourism and cultural tourism. (\\"[W]hat tourists actually come to see is the Caribs themselves.\\"). The Territory and its residents receive very little revenue from tourism, however; there is no entry fee for visitors or any site management fees charged for nature activities, and most visitors stay and arrange their travel from outside the Territory.. Images of the Kalinago Territory and its people have also been used to promote tourism to Dominica as a whole, rather than the Kalinago Territory specifically. (\\"Carib images are more likely to be found promoting the entire island rather than the territory itself.\\"). Kalinago arts and crafts are widely sold in the Territory, and elsewhere in Dominica, as souvenirs.; ; (\\"The primary commodity value is through souvenirs, mainly the sale of handicrafts such as baskets woven of the larouma reed or bags made of heliconia leaves.\\"). Chief among these is the larouma reed basket, which is handmade in brown, white, and black traditional designs; this craft has been noted as one of the few enduring aspects of traditional Kalinago culture.Historian Lennox Honychurch has called these baskets the Carib people's \\"strongest link with the past.\\" . See also , and discussion at . The Kalinago Barana Aut√©, a representation of a pre-Columbian Kalinago village, is located in the hamlet of Crayfish River.. In the Kalinago language, the name translates to \\"Kalinago cultural village by the sea.\\" It opened in April 2006, with funding from the Dominican government. The village was based on a concept of Faustulus Frederick, who served as Kalinago Chief from 1975 to 1978. Its goal is to recreate and promote awareness of Kalinago traditions and culture. Its central feature is a karbet, a kind of large hut that used to be located in the center of a Kalinago village.\\"Karbet\\" is actually a French word used to describe the kind of structure; the original Carib word, taboui, has fallen into disuse. See . The main karbet (biggest hut) is used to stage presentations of Kalinago culture, such as dance performances. Other traditional cultural demonstrations at the Kalinago Barana Aut√© include pottery making, cassava processing, and basket weaving.. Numerous organizations seek to preserve, teach, and promote Kalinago culture. Among these are the Karifuna Cultural Group and Karina Cultural Group, which stage music and dance performances for tourists at the Kalinago Barana Aut√© and a small stage in Bataka.. The Karifuna Cultural Group has traveled throughout the Caribbean, as well as South America and Europe, promoting Kalinago cultural heritage. The Karina Cultural Group has also established ties with Amerindian groups in South America. The Waitukubuli Karifuna Development Committee has built several traditional buildings in Salybia. Among these is the church of St. Marie of the Kalinago, which is decorated with murals depicting Kalinago history, and has a Kalinago canoe for an altar.; .

Design and development The first GV-103L, as it was originally called, was a two- or three-seat light touring aircraft first flown in 1969. Later referred to as the GV-103 and powered by an 86 kW (115 hp) Lycoming O-235 flat-four engine, it led to several production variants with two, three and four seats using engines of increasing power within the same airframe. It had a side-by-side seating layout and a fixed tricycle undercarriage with a longer nosewheel which gave the aircraft a pronounced tail-down attitude on the ground. Its construction was primarily metal but included some glass fibre structures and plastic bonding, novel at the time. First flown on 1 May 1969, the GV-103 first appeared in public at the Paris Air Show in June 1969. The first two- seat production prototype GV-1020 Gazelle was on display at the Paris 1971 Show. It was intended to meet a club market for basic and aerobatic training. The second Gazelle to fly was the prototype of the four-seat GV-1031 tourer, powered by a 112 kW (150 hp) Lycoming O-320 flat-four engine. An intermediate, three-seat variant with a Rolls-Royce built 97 kW (130 hp) Continental O-240 engine was planned but may not have been built. A four-five seat variant with a 134 kW (180 hhp) engine and retractable undercarriage was also planned, and feasibility studies of a twin-engine version made, but neither reached the construction stage. Operational history By November 1972 seven Gazelle prototypes were flying and the GV-1301 received its French certification in April that year, with the CV-1020 expected to follow in January 1973.

The fourth tropical cyclone and third named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, Colin developed as a tropical depression from a low-pressure area in the central Atlantic on August 2\\\\. After forming, the storm initially strengthened gradually, attaining tropical storm status early on August 3\\\\. However, due to its acceleration to the west-northwest, Colin was unable to maintain a closed circulation and subsequently degenerated into a trough later that day. The National Hurricane Center noted the possibility of regeneration over subsequent days, and by August 5, Colin had once again become a tropical cyclone. Despite moderate wind shear impacting the system, Colin reached a peak intensity of 60 mph (95 km/h) on August 5\\\\. However, vertical wind shear prevented further intensification and eventually weakened the storm. By early on August 8, Colin had weakened to a tropical depression, and dissipated near Bermuda shortly after. Though it remained well offshore, Colin produced rough seas along the East Coast of the United States. At least 205 ocean rescues were made. In Bermuda, effects were generally minimal. Less than of rain fell and winds remained below tropical storm force. Meteorological history The origins of Tropical Storm Colin can be traced back to an elongated tropical wave that moved westward from Nigeria to Senegal on July 28\\\\. A nearly stationary trough separated from the wave as it continued westward. A larger tropical wave emerged off the west coast of Africa a few days later. A broad area of low pressure resulted from the consolidation of the two waves on August 1, when it was situated about 750 mi (1210 km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands. Over the course of the next 24 hours, shower and thunderstorm activity became increasingly consolidated with the low, but the system lacked a well-defined circulation to be considered a tropical cyclone at the time. However, on the next day, an Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) pass revealed that the circulation center had become sufficiently defined, and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Four at 1200 UTC on August 2. Further organization occurred as the depression moved around the southern periphery of a strong subtropical ridge. Thunderstorm activity became increasingly defined, and it is estimated that the depression became Tropical Storm Colin at 0600 UTC on August 3 while centered 840 mi (1350 km) east of the Lesser Antilles. alt=Satellite image of a tropical cyclone. The storm is a rather disorganized cluster of storms Early on August 3, Colin's forward motion increased, and the cyclone was unable to maintain a closed circulation. The tropical storm degenerated into a trough at 1800 UTC, although tropical storm-force winds persisted. As the remnants passed north of the northern Leeward Islands, a reconnaissance aircraft investigated the system on August 4, but no closed circulation was found. As the remnants approached a weakness in the subtropical ridge across the western Atlantic on August 5, its forward speed gradually slowed as well. A combination of microwave and satellite imagery during the morning hours of August 5 revealed the reformation of a closed low, and Colin's remnants regained tropical storm status at this time while located 280 mi (450 km) north-northeast of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Despite relatively unfavorable vertical wind shear impacting Colin, deep thunderstorm activity developed atop its center of circulation. Data from a reconnaissance aircraft during the afternoon hours of August 5 revealed that the system reached a peak intensity with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 1005 mbar (29.68 inHg). A few computer models, namely the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) and Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting model (HWRF), predicted that Colin would briefly attain hurricane status. However, the surrounding moderate vertical wind shear prevented this. While turning towards the north on August 6, the cyclone entered an area increasingly unfavorable wind shear and cooler sea surface temperatures, subsequently prompting the NHC to downgrade Colin to a tropical depression by 0000 UTC on August 8\\\\. Further weakening occurred over the next few hours as the cyclone's center of circulation became elongated, and Colin once again degenerated into a trough of low pressure at 1200 UTC while located approximately 100 mi (160 km) southwest of Bermuda. The remnant trough persisted until early on August 9, at which time it was situated 150 mi (240 km) northwest of the island. Preparations and impact Following Colin's regeneration into a tropical cyclone on August 5, the Government of Bermuda simultaneously issued a tropical storm warning for the island. Along south- facing beaches, Colin was expected to produce a storm surge between , possibly reaching as high as . Significant rainfall was also anticipated, with totals averaging . These values were later decreased after Colin weakened on August 6, with only a minimal storm surge forecast and rainfall roughly less than previously stated. By August 7, all beaches were closed across the island due to rough seas and dangerous rip currents. The Royal Caribbean cruise ship, MS Explorer of the Seas, arrived in Bermuda that same day and was scheduled to set sail again on August 8; however, due to the threat of Colin, the vessel was forced leave later in the day instead of staying overnight. On August 8, the tropical storm warning in place for Bermuda was downgraded to a watch as Colin weakened to a tropical depression; it was discontinued hours later as the storm quickly dissipated. Due to Colin's weakening to a tropical depression prior to its closest pass to Bermuda, its effects were significantly less than initially anticipated. Winds from the storm reached , with gusts to . Rainfall was limited to isolated showers and thunderstorms; the Bermuda International Airport measured of rain in relation to Colin. Throughout the island, there were no reports of damage. Although situated several hundred miles off the coast of the East Coast of the United States, the outer effects of Colin were expected to create dangerous rip currents along the North and South Carolina coastlines, as well as waves as high as . On August 7, a 51-year-old man drowned off the coast of Ocracoke, North Carolina after being caught in a rip current. Shortly after his death, officials issued rip current and undertow threats for the region. Between August 7 and 9, at least 205 ocean rescues were made along the North Carolina coastline due to rough seas produced by Colin.

Vicer√© Marchese Francesco Jacomoni di San Savino (31 August 1893 ‚Äì 17 February 1973) was an Italian diplomat and governor of Albania before and during World War II. Biography He was born in Reggio di Calabria on 31 August 1893 to a banker's family. In 1914 he enlisted in the army for his national service. Named Lieutenant of Fortress Artillery in June 1915, Jacomoni participated in the campaigns of the Italian Front of World War I. At the same time, he pursued his studies in Law at the University of Rome, and graduated in July 1916. In May 1919 he was appointed as a member of the Italian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, and worked as a liaison with the Austrian, Hungarian and later Bulgarian delegations. In October 1919 he was appointed as secretary in the Italian embassy at Bucharest, a post he held until recalled to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in August 1920. In the next few years he served in various diplomatic missions and delegations as a secretary, including a brief mission to Albania in April 1926, where he laid much groundwork for the Italo-Albanian Friendship and Mutual Assistance Treaty of November 1926. On his return, he became a close associate of Dino Grandi, then Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs and soon to become Minister. Initially head of the Ministry's Historical Service but late rising to be deputy head of Grandi's ministerial office, he participated in a number of missions to the Italian delegations to international conferences regarding the Dawes and Young plans, or the London Naval Conference 1930. In October 1932, Jacomoni married Maja Cavallero, the daughter of General (and later Marshal) Ugo Cavallero. During the next few years, he was engaged mainly in Geneva at the League of Nations. He was appointed as minister to the Kingdom of Albania from 9 September 1936 until shortly after the Italian invasion of Albania in April 1939. On 17 April he was promoted to ambassadorial rank and on 22 April he became the country's Viceroy (Luogotenente del Re, \\"Lieutenant-General of the King\\"). Jacomoni retained this post, which made him the country's effective governor, during much of the Italian occupation. He was replaced with General Alberto Pariani on 18 March 1943, after his policy of severe repression had failed to halt the growth of the Albanian Resistance movement. After the war, he was tried along with other senior officials of the Fascist regime, and sentenced by the Italian High Court to 24 years imprisonment on 12 March 1945. He was however released with the general amnesty issued by the Italian government in June 1946, and his sentence was finally commuted altogether in March 1948. He published his memoirs on his tenure in Albania under the title of La politica dell'Italia in Albania in 1965, and died in Rome on 17 February 1973.

She later became president and sole shareholder of Hollis Crossing Realty, Inc., a real estate marketing and sales company. Tamposi served in the New Hampshire House of Representatives from 1979 to 1986, chairing the House Ways and Means Committee and implementing a rainy day fund for the state. During the 1988 congressional election, Tamposi sought election to the United States House of Representatives from New Hampshire, but lost the Republican primary, largely due to her opponent's assertions that it would be inappropriate for a mother of young children to leave the home and hold political office.\\"Tamposi Family Files for Bankruptcy\\", Boston Herald, Aug. 24, 1991 On August 4, 1989, President of the United States George H. W. Bush nominated Tamposi as Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs; after Senate confirmation, she held this office from October 18, 1989 until November 10, 1992. As Assistant Secretary, Tamposi travelled to 70 countries to assist Americans in need, and implemented measures to make the visa and passport application process more efficient. Tamposi resigned a week after the 1992 U.S. presidential election of November 3, 1992, amidst allegations that she had abused her position as head of the Bureau of Consular Affairs, the bureau responsible for issuing United States passports. According to Tamposi, on September 28, 1992, she was contacted by Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs Stephen K. Berry contacted her on behalf of the White House, asking her to search the consular records for a purported letter in which Democratic presidential candidate Bill Clinton either renounced his U.S. citizenship, or sought information about how to go about renouncing it, during his Vietnam War protest days in the late 1960s.Walter Pincus, \\"Tamposi Implicates Superiors in Passport Search Scandal\\", Washington Post, Nov. 17, 1992 Tamposi directed her subordinates to make such a search. She also later ordered a search of the passport records of third party candidate Ross Perot. When these searches were made public, Acting United States Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger fired Tamposi as Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs on November 10, 1992. Tamposi argued that her superiors in the United States Department of State were aware of these requests and that she was being unfairly singled out for her role in the scandal. Tamposi's name was later cleared of any wrongdoing and President Bush wrote her a hand- written apology stating that she is of \\"good character.\\" From 2005 to 2011, Tamposi was a member of the Board of Governors of the University of New Hampshire.UNH Course Catalog References Category:1955 births Category:United States Assistant Secretaries of State Category:Living people Category:People from Nashua, New Hampshire Category:University of New Hampshire alumni Category:Harvard Divinity School alumni Category:New Hampshire Republicans Category:American women diplomats Category:American people of Romanian descent Category:John F.

In a dynamical system, all possible states are expressed by a phase space. Such systems can experience bifurcation (a qualitative change in behavior) as a function of its bifurcation parameters and often exhibit chaos. Dynamical neuroscience describes the non-linear dynamics at many levels of the brain from single neural cellsIzhikevich, E. Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience: The Geometry of Excitability and Bursting. Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 2007. to cognitive processes, sleep states and the behavior of neurons in large-scale neuronal simulation.Agenda of the Dynamical Neuroscience XVIII: The resting brain: not at rest! Neurons have been modeled as nonlinear systems for decades now, but dynamical systems emerge in numerous other ways in the nervous system. From chemistry, chemical species models like the Gray‚ÄìScott model exhibit rich, chaotic dynamics. Dynamic interactions between extracellular fluid pathways reshapes our view of intraneural communication. Information theory draws on thermodynamics in the development of infodynamics which can involve nonlinear systems, especially with regards to the brain. History One of the first well-known incidences in which neurons were modeled on a mathematical and physical basis was the integrate-and-fire model developed in 1907. Decades later, the discovery of the squid giant axon eventually led Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley (half- brother to Aldous Huxley) to develop the Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley model of the neuron in 1952. This model was simplified with the FitzHugh‚ÄìNagumo model in 1962. Izhikevich E. and FitzHugh R. (2006), Scholarpedia, 1(9):1349 By 1981, the Morris‚ÄìLecar model had been developed for the barnacle muscle. These mathematical models proved useful and are still used by the field of biophysics today, but a late 20th century development propelled the dynamical study of neurons even further: computer technology. The largest issue with physiological equations like the ones developed above is that they were nonlinear. This made the standard analysis impossible and any advanced kinds of analysis included a number of (nearly) endless possibilities. Computers opened a lot of doors for all of the hard sciences in terms of their ability to approximate solutions to nonlinear equations. This is the aspect of computational neuroscience that dynamical systems encompasses. In 2007, a canonical text book was written by Eugene Izhikivech called Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience, assisting the transformation of an obscure research topic into a line of academic study. Neuron dynamics (intro needed here) =Electrophysiology of the neuron= The motivation for a dynamical approach to neuroscience stems from an interest in the physical complexity of neuron behavior. As an example, consider the coupled interaction between a neuron's membrane potential and the activation of ion channels throughout the neuron. As the membrane potential of a neuron increases sufficiently, channels in the membrane open up to allow more ions in or out. The ion flux further alters the membrane potential, which further affects the activation of the ion channels, which affects the membrane potential, and so on. This is often the nature of coupled nonlinear equations. A nearly straight forward example of this is the Morris‚ÄìLecar model: : \\\\begin{align} C {dV \\\\over dt} & = g_{Ca} M_{ss} (V-V_Ca) - g_K N (V-V_K) - g_L(V-V_L) + I_\\\\text{app} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] {dN \\\\over dt} & = {{N_{ss} - N} \\\\over {\\\\tau_N}} \\\\end{align} See the Morris‚ÄìLecar paper for a in-depth understanding of the model. A more brief summary of the Morris Lecar model is given by Scholarpedia.Lecar, H. (2007), Scholarpedia, 2(10):1333 In this article, the point is to demonstrate the physiological basis of dynamical neuron models, so this discussion will only cover the two variables of the equation: *V represents the membrane's current potential *N is the so-called \\"recovery variable\\", which gives us the probability that a particular potassium channel is open to allow ion conduction. Most importantly, the first equation states that the change of V with respect to time depends on both V and N, as does the change in N with respect to time. M_{ss} and N_{ss} are both functions of V. So we have two coupled functions, g(V,N) and g(V,N). Different types of neuron models utilize different channels, depending on the physiology of the organism involved. For instance, the simplified two- dimensional Hodgkins‚ÄìHuxley model considers sodium channels, while the Morris‚ÄìLecar model considers calcium channels. Both models consider potassium and leak current. Note, however, that the Hodgkins‚ÄìHuxley model is canonically four-dimensional.Hodgkin, A. and Huxley, A. (1952): A quantitative description of membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in nerve. J. Physiol. 117:500‚Äì544. =Excitability of neurons= One of the predominant themes in classical neurobiology is the concept of a digital component to neurons. This concept was quickly absorbed by computer scientists where it evolved into the simple weighting function for coupled artificial neural networks. Neurobiologists call the critical voltage at which neurons fire a threshold. The dynamical criticism of this digital concept is that neurons don't truly exhibit all-or-none firing and should instead be thought of as resonators.Izhikevich, E. Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience: The Geometry of Excitability and Bursting. Massachusetts: The MIT Press, 2007. In dynamical systems, this kind of property is known as excitability. An excitable system starts at some stable point. Imagine an empty lake at the top of a mountain with a ball in it. The ball is in a stable point. Gravity is pulling it down, so it's fixed at the lake bottom. If we give it a big enough push, it will pop out of the lake and roll down the side of the mountain, gaining momentum and going faster. Let's say we fashioned a loop-de-loop around the base of the mountain so that the ball will shoot up it and return to the lake (no rolling friction or air resistance). Now we have a system that stays in its rest state (the ball in the lake) until a perturbation knocks it out (rolling down the hill) but eventually returns to its rest state (back in the lake). In this example, gravity is the driving force and spatial dimensions x (horizontal) and y (vertical) are the variables. In the Morris Lecar neuron, the fundamental force is electromagnetic and V and N are the new phase space, but the dynamical picture is essentially the same. The electromagnetic force acts along V just as gravity acts along y. The shape of the mountain and the loop- de-loop act to couple the y and x dimensions to each other. In the neuron, nature has already decided how V and N are coupled, but the relationship is much more complicated than the gravitational example. This property of excitability is what gives neurons the ability to transmit information to each other, so it is important to dynamical neuron networks, but the Morris Lecar can also operate in another parameter regime where it exhibits oscillatory behavior, forever oscillating around in phase space. This behavior is comparable to pacemaker cells in the heart, that don't rely on excitability but may excite neurons that do. Global neurodynamics The global dynamics of a network of neurons depend on at least the first three of four attributes: # individual neuron dynamics (primarily, their thresholds or excitability) # information transfer between neurons (generally either synapses or gap junctions # network topology # external forces (such as thermodynamic gradients) There are many combinations of neural networks that can be modeled between the choices of these four attributes that can result in a versatile array of global dynamics. =Biological neural network modeling= Biological neural networks can be modeled by choosing an appropriate biological neuron model to describe the physiology of the organism and appropriate coupling terms to describe the physical interactions between neurons (forming the network). Other global considerations must be taken into consideration, such as the initial conditions and parameters of each neuron. In terms of nonlinear dynamics, this requires evolving the state of the system through the functions. Following from the Morris Lecar example, the alterations to the equation would be: : \\\\begin{align} C {dV_i \\\\over dt} & = g_{Ca} M_{ss} (V_i- V_{Ca}) - g_K N_i (V_i-V_K) - g_L(V_i-V_L) + I_\\\\text{app} + D(V_i) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] {dN_i \\\\over dt} & = {{N_{ss} - N_i} \\\\over {\\\\tau_N}} \\\\end{align} where V now has the subscript i, indicating that it is the ith neuron in the network and a coupling function has been added to the first equation. The coupling function, D, is chosen based on the particular network being modeled. The two major candidates are synaptic junctions and gap junctions.

(2007), Scholarpedia, 2(10):1380 Beyond neurons While neurons play a lead role in brain dynamics, it is becoming more clear to neuroscientists that neuron behavior is highly dependent on their environment. But the environment is not a simple background, and there is a lot happening right outside of the neuron membrane, in the extracellular space. Neurons share this space with glial cells and the extracellular space itself may contain several agents of interaction with the neurons. =Glia= Glia, once considered a mere support system for neurons, have been found to serve a significant role in the brain. The subject of how the interaction between neuron and glia have an influence on neuron excitability is a question of dynamics.Nadkarni, S. (2005) Dynamics of Dressed Neurons: Modeling the Neural-Glial Circuit and Exploring its Normal and Pathological Implications. Doctoral dissertation. Ohio University, Ohio. =Neurochemistry= Like any other cell, neurons operate on an undoubtedly complex set of molecular reactions. Each cell is a tiny community of molecular machinery (organelles) working in tandem and encased in a lipid membrane. These organelles communicate largely via chemicals like G-proteins and neurotransmitters, consuming ATP for energy. Such chemical complexity is of interest to physiological studies of the neuron. Neuromodulation :Neurons in the brain live in an extracellular fluid, capable of propagating both chemical and physical energy alike through reaction-diffusion and bond manipulation that leads to thermal gradients. Volume transmission has been associated with thermal gradients caused by biological reactions in the brain.Fuxe, K., Rivera, A., Jacobsen, K., Hoistad, M., Leo, G., Horvath, T., Stained, W., De la calle, A. and Agnati, L. (2005) Dynamics of volume transmission in the brain. Focus on catecholamine and opioid peptide communication and the role of uncoupling protein 2. Journal of Neural Transmission, 112:1. Such complex transmission has been associated with migraines. Cognitive neuroscience The computational approaches to theoretical neuroscience often employ artificial neural networks that simplify the dynamics of single neurons in favor of examining more global dynamics. While neural networks are often associated with artificial intelligence, they have also been productive in the cognitive sciences.Gluck, M. 2001. Gateway to Memory: An Introduction to Neural Network Modeling of the Hippocampus and Learning. Massachusetts: MIT. Artificial neural networks use simple neuron models, but their global dynamics are capable of exhibiting both Hopfield and Attractor-like network dynamics. =Hopfield network= The Lyapunov function is a nonlinear technique used to analyze the stability of the zero solutions of a system of differential equations. Hopfield networks were specifically designed such that their underlying dynamics could be described by the Lyapunov function. Stability in biological systems is called homeostasis. Particularly of interest to the cognitive sciences, Hopfield networks have been implicated in the role of associative memory (memory triggered by cues).Hopfield, J.

Etymology The specific name, moojeni, is in honor of Brazilian zoologist Jo√£o Moojen de Oliveira (1904-1985).Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Bothrops moojeni, p. 182).  Description and Behavior  Grows on average 160 cm, with a maximum of 230 cm already reported, has a tan, gray-brown or olive-gray color, with fourteen to twenty- one trapezoidal side marks that are dark gray or completely black, 23 to 29 lines of dorsal scale of the average body, with the belly usually white or cream with dark gray spots scattered, while juveniles have a white tail. It is terrestrial, of nocturnal habits.https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/afpmb/docs/lhd/venomous_animals_byspecies.pdf it is considered very aggressive, able to make vertical boats, sometimes reaching the highest parts of the body. Geographic range and Habitat B. moojeni is found in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay. The type locality is Bras√≠lia, Distrito Federal, Brazil.. www.reptile-database.org B. moojeni inhabits Araucaria moist forests and the Cerrado.Borges RC, Araujo AFB (1998). \\"Sele√ß√£o de habitat em duas esp√©cies de jararaca ( Bothrops moojeni Hoge e B. neuwiedi Wagler) (Serpentes: Viperidae)\\". Revista Brasileira de Biologia 58 (4): 591-601. (in Portuguese). Reproduction B. moojeni is viviparous. Gestation lasts around four months, occurs once a year and 12 to 14 puppies are usually born. Live an average of 15 years.  Diet  It feeds on small mammals, birds, lizards, snakes and amphibians. Common names In South America common names for B. moojeni include cai√ßaca, caissaca, cai√ßara, jacuru√ßu, and jarara√ß√£o.  Venom  Its venom has hemolytic and proteolytic action. B. moojeni venom contains a wide variety of enzymes, such as acidic phospholipase, base A phospholipase, metalloproteinases, serine proteinases, L-amino acid oxidase, and a myotoxin phospholipase A2. The myotoxin phospholipase A2 causes necrosis in muscle fibers, releasing creatinine kinase. Symptoms may include intense local pain, edema, muscular necrosis.The venom has an anticoagulant effect on the blood, makes the blood uncoagulable, causes severe hemorraghes and strokes. The venom has a lethal dose of 0.205 mg / kg for horses. References Further reading *Hoge AR (1966). \\"Preliminary account on Neotropical Crotalinae (Serpentes: Viperidae)\\".

Mexican Coca-Cola has become popular in the United States due to its flavor, which is considered by many to differ from American Coke. History Coca-Cola opened its first bottling franchise in Mexico around 1921 with Grupo Tampico, and then Grupo ARMA. Monterrey-based FEMSA is currently the largest Coca-Cola bottler in Mexico, along with most of Latin America. Mexican Coke is often sold in the United States due to the popularity of its different ingredient makeup. It is so well known that it can be sold in its authentic packaging The Coca-Cola Company originally imported the Mexican- produced version into the U.S. primarily to sell it to Mexican immigrants who grew up with that formula. Mexican Coke was first sold at grocers who served Latino clientele, but as its popularity grew among non-Latinos, larger chains like Costco, Sam's club and Kroger began to stock it. It is now readily available at most grocery stores throughout the United States. In 2013, a Mexican Coca-Cola bottler announced it would stop using cane sugar in favor of glucose-fructose syrup. It later clarified this change would not affect those bottles specifically exported to the United States as \\"Coca-Cola Nostalgia\\" products. Although intended for consumption in Mexico, Mexican Coca-Cola has become popular in the United States because of a flavor that Coca-Cola fans call more \\"natural tasting\\". This purported difference in taste comes from Mexican Coca-cola being sweetened with cane sugar, as opposed to American-made coke which has been sweetened with fructose since the early 1980s. \\"Mexican Coke\\" as sold in America can differ from coke bottled and sold in Mexico; most of the Mexican Coke exported to the United States is made with cane sugar, while some Mexican bottlers may use high-fructose corn syrup for drinks intended for domestic sale in Mexico. A scientific analysis of Mexican Coke found no sucrose (standard sugar), but instead found fructose and glucose levels similar to other soft drinks sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup. =Taste = Results from taste tests have been mixed. In a taste test conducted by a local Westchester, New York magazine, tasters noted that the Mexican Coke had \\"a more complex flavor with an ineffable spicy and herbal note\\", and that it contained something \\"that darkly hinted at root beer or old-fashioned sarsaparilla candies\\". However, participants in a different double-blind taste test overwhelmingly preferred American Coca-Cola. Participants in taste tests conducted by Coca-Cola and others reported no perceptible differences in flavor between American Coke and the Mexican formulation. =Bottle= Mexican Coca-Cola is sold in a thick or glass bottle, which some have described in contrast to the more common plastic American Coca-Cola bottles as being \\"more elegant, with a pleasingly nostalgic shape\\". Formerly, Coca-Cola was widely available in refundable and non- refundable glass bottles of various sizes in the U.S., but nearly all bottlers began phasing them out and replacing most glass bottles with plastic, during the late 1980s. Most exporters of Mexican Coke affix a paper sticker on each bottle containing the nutrition facts label, ingredients, and bottler and/or exporter's contact information, to meet US food labeling requirements. Adding to the nostalgia factor, the Mexican Coca-Cola glass bottle does not have a twist-off cap (for plastic bottles) or a pull-tab (for cans). A bottle opener is required to drink the bottle's contents. =New Zealand= A similar phenomenon exists in New Zealand, where Coca-Cola is available both bottled locally (sweetened with sugar) and imported from the United States (with high- fructose corn syrup).

The team was attacked as it was returning from Nuristan to Kabul. One team member was spared, the rest of the team were killed immediately. Those killed were six Americans, two Afghans, one Briton and one German. The identity of the attackers is unknown. When news of the killings broke, both Hizb-e Islami and the Taliban initially claimed responsibility for the attack, accusing the doctors of proselytism and spying. These claims were later refuted by Taliban leaders in Nuristan and Badakhshan, who stated that they had confirmed the dead were bona-fide aid workers, condemned the killings as murder, and offered their condolences to the families of those killed.The Afghanistan Analysts Network: Ten Dead in Badakhshan 6: Local Taliban Say it was Murder The attack was the deadliest strike against foreign aid workers in the Afghanistan war. The killings underscored the suspicion Christian-affiliated groups face from some Afghans and government opponents and the wider risks faced by aid workers in the country. Background and context Badakhshan province borders Tajikistan and is inhabited by mostly Tajik people. It is one of the few provinces in Afghanistan which was not controlled by the Taliban when it was in power. After coming under increasing pressure by NATO forces in southern Afghanistan the Taliban have become active in areas like Badakhshan Province which were previously calm. In addition they have started using women and children as suicide bombers and targeted tribal elders, things they formerly considered taboo. Foreign aid workers have been attacked in the past but these attacks have been relatively infrequent and Taliban has allowed some aid workers in the areas they controlled. Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission stated that civilian deaths were up five percent in 2010 and Taliban was responsible for 68% of the 1325 deaths till 8 August 2010 and NATO was responsible for 28%. IAM is a Christian organization that has worked in Afghanistan since 1966. They have denied proselytizing, as for non-Muslims it is against the law of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. According to critics propagandists of the Taliban insurgency portray their drive for power as a defense of Islam. The victims of the massacre had indeed been sponsored by a Christian charity, but that organization worked in Afghanistan since 1966, under a monarchy, a communist regime, warlords, and under the Taliban; its aid workers were said to understand the Afghan customs and sensibilities and have scrupulously obeyed prohibitions against proselytizing. None of the Christian non-profit's workers had ever been killed while on duty with the organisation. The publicity on the massacre and its aftermath coincided with the publication of the 2010 Mid-Year Report on Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), in which worries were expressed about the rising number of civilian casualties in Afghanistan and that was directly followed by an advice of human rights organisation Amnesty International that the Taliban should be prosecuted for war crimes. According to the UNAMA report, the tactics of the Taliban and other Anti- Government Elements (AGEs) were behind a 31 per cent increase in conflict- related civilian casualties in the first six months of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. Casualties attributed to Pro-Government Forces (PGF) fell 30 per cent during the same period, driven by a 64 per cent decline in deaths and injuries caused by aerial attacks. Many Afghans blame the international forces for the civilian deaths, \\"stirring up greater violence by fomenting new recruits for the Taliban, for arming militias in the countryside, and for propping up warlords and corrupt Afghan officials\\". Ambush The team, which included a doctor, a dentist and an optometrist, was returning to Kabul after providing eye care to villagers in Parun valley in Nuristan Province, south of Badakhshan Province in Northeast Afghanistan. They had been running an eye camp in Nuristan, for which they had received permission from the Afghan government. They had chosen to travel through a forest in Badakhshan as this was considered a safer route back to Kabul. The team was attacked when they stopped after fording a river. They were killed immediately, without any negotiation. One Afghan driver was spared after he started chanting verses from the Qur'an. When the bodies were recovered, the victims appeared to have been robbed. The two Afghans killed worked as a watchman and a cook. The bodies of the victims were flown back to Kabul on 8 August 2010. The foreigners killed were all unpaid volunteers.

Significant Afghanistan efforts included providing free dental care in the village Wardak, \\"negotiat[ing] the etiquette of the burka\\" to found a Kabul dental clinic (employing a local female dentist), and participating in English teaching at a local school. \\"[U]nassuming and modest,\\" Grams was described by the IAM as \\"one of our favorit[e]\\" aid workers. = Jawed = Jawed, known by this single name, aged 24 years, from Panjshir, Afghanistan, was a civilian contractor that had been at the Eye Hospital of the Afghan Ministry of Public Health in Kabul, and was given leave to serve as the team cook at its Eye Camp. This was not his first service with IAM, where he cooked and helped with dispensing eyeglasses; per the IAM, ‚ÄúJawed had been on several eye camps into Nuristan in the past, and was well loved for his sense of humor,‚Äù and was known for providing his collection of music tapes for weddings and parties. The principal breadwinner for his wife, three young children, and extended family, Jawed had been excited about the $20-a-day in overtime that he was earning on the medical outreach trip. Jawed's brother Abdul Bagin described his killers as \\"infidels; not human, not Muslims... [killing] without any judgment, without any trial‚Äù. = Glen D. Lapp = Glen D. Lapp, aged 40 years, was a nurse and executive assistant from Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States, and a part of Community Mennonite Church of Lancaster. Lapp was a medical volunteer with the IAM and its partner, the Mennonite Central Committee (MCC). He was serving as manager of IAM's provincial Ophthalmology program, and as an executive assistant for IAM in Afghanistan, and had been in Afghanistan for two years. Lapp was an alumnus of Eastern Mennonite and Johns Hopkins Universities, and had assisted the MCC in the weeks following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, with regular prior nursing work Lancaster, Supai, Arizona, and New York City. = Tom Little = Tom Little, aged 61 years, was an optometrist from Delmar, New York, United States, and leader of the IAM team. Little had worked in Afghanistan for more than three decades, having arrived in the late 1970s; he had raised three daughters there, and spoke Dari fluently. Little was posthumously recognized as International Optometrist of the Year by the World Council of Optometry, and the 2010 Presidential Medal of Freedom. = Dan Terry = Dan Terry, aged 64 years, was from Wisconsin, United States, who served as liaison with local communities, aid organizations, and the government; he had performed relief work in Afghanistan since 1971, following in his father's footsteps who had worked for IAM as the Executive Director. He is survived by his wife, three daughters, their spouses and five grandchildren. = Karen Woo = Karen Woo, aged 36 years, daughter of a Chinese father and English mother, was a general surgeon from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, UK, trained at St Mary's Hospital, London and formerly with the English healthcare organisation Bupa. Woo's work involved helping pregnant women, in an area with a high global infant mortality rate. After her death, Woo's family stated that \\"although very spiritual, she did not really believe in organised religion\\" and that her motivations were purely humanitarian. Woo was engaged to be married at the time of her death. = Survivors = The only two survivors of the eye camp team were Said Yasin and Safiullah, both Afghan. Said Yasin had left the team several days earlier and returned to Kabul by another route, whereas Safiullah was spared after reciting verses from the Koran. Responsibility The local officials initially stated that the motive was robbery, but after interviewing witnesses they changed their view and said that Taliban was responsible. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the attacks and accused the victims of being \\"American spies\\" and \\"proselytizing Christianity\\". He also claimed that the victims had Bibles in their possession which had been translated into Dari, the local language. However, another group also was mentioned, the Hizb-i-Islami (HIA) of warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.\\"Hezb-e-Islami killed 2 Afghans and 8 foreigners\\" \\"HIA claims killing medics\\" Earlier claims of the Taliban were refuted by Qari Malang, the representative of the Western Nuristan Taliban. He said that commanders from Nuristan had not carried out the killings and they had launched an investigation to find out who had. \\"We shall inform you of the results when it is concluded. We regret these killings and strongly assert that this is not the work of the Taliban who will never do harm to genuine aid workers‚Ä¶ as soon as we manage to apprehend those responsible for this act, we shall subject them to whatever punishment our laws prescribe.\\" Dirk Frans, executive director of the IAM in Kabul, doubted whether the local Taliban were behind the attack, in contrast to a statement by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton which directly blamed the Taliban for what she described as a \\"despicable act of wanton violence.\\". In her reaction on 8 August 2010, she stated: \\"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this senseless act. We also condemn the Taliban‚Äôs transparent attempt to justify the unjustifiable by making false accusations about their activities in Afghanistan. Terror has no religion (...), they have shown us yet another example of the lengths to which they will go to advance their twisted ideology.\\" Reactions In the weeks following the attack a senior Taliban leader, Qari Malang (the representative of the Western Nuristan Taliban) stated \\"We have checked the facts regarding these foreigners, and our people in the area have confirmed that they were bona fide aid workers and had been providing assistance to the population. Furthermore, we have learnt that among the killed foreigners, was Dan Terry, who had a long history of helping our people, including in Kunar and Laghman provinces and that he had previously provided welfare assistance to the families of those civilians martyred in bombardments‚Ä¶ We pass on our condolences to the families of those killed.\\" After the massacre, the IAM stated that they had no plans to leave Afghanistan. US Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened an investigation into the attacks according to a spokesman from US embassy. Former Afghan presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah who is a physician himself and trained with Tom Little deplored the killings and called the attackers \\"enemies of the Afghan people.\\" United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who emphasized that \\"health workers must have access to treat those in need and must be able to do so without fear.\\" His Special Representative Staffan de Mistura said \\"The United Nations condemns this serious crime and apparent cold-blooded execution.\\" Australian foreign minister Stephen Smith issued a statement condemning the attack and offered condolences to the victims' families. British foreign secretary William Hague condemned the attack and stated \\"This is a deplorable and cowardly act which is against the interests of the people of Afghanistan who depended on the services she [Karen Woo] was bravely helping to provide.\\" United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemned the killings, calling them \\"despicable acts of wanton violence.\\" (see above) Karl Eikenberry, the current United States Ambassador to Afghanistan, speaking to Afghan people said, \\"Their murder demonstrates the absolute disregard that terrorist-inspired Taliban and other insurgents have for your health, have for your security and have for your opportunity, They don't care about your future. They only care about themselves and their own ideology.\\" US special envoy Richard Holbrooke stated the killers do not represent average Afghans, most of whom were shocked by these killings.

During the Second World War she was registered as a volunteer nurse, and was successively assigned to different posts (army, youth camps, children retreated from bombed areas, repatriation of deportees and prisoners). Art career At the beginning of her career, Bertrand painted in an expressionist way, but, later evolved into what can be described as relative abstraction. Bertrand during her long career mixed all manners of painting, jumbling styles and periods and paying only a little attention to dates. In the immediate post war period, she organized exhibitions regularly (Salon d'Automne, Salon de Mai, Comparaison, Salon Women Painters and Sculptors). Her first solo exhibition was organized at the Paris's Galerie Pascaud in 1947. For the artist many other single person exhibitions followed, mostly in Paris and Metz, but also in the other French departments and abroad (i.e. Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, Italy, etc...).http://valerie.dexemple.perso.neuf.fr/fondation/Expositions.html Bertrand gained several honours, including gaining the title of Master Academician in 1985. On May 2005, a sale of 108 of her works achieved success at the H√¥tel Drouot Her work is today in public collections (Museums of Metz, Nancy, Picasso Museum in Antibes, Ch√©ret Museum in Nice, etc...), as well as many private collections. Bertrand died on January 22 of 2011 at the age of 97. Solange Bertrand foundation In 2001, Lionel Jospin, then Prime Minister of France, recognized by decree as a public interest the creation of the Solange Bertrand Foundation, preserving and exhibiting artworks of the artist.

Freeport lies on the eastern banks of the Sacramento River in Sacramento County. The population was 38 at the 2010 census. History Nearly all goods traveling to Sacramento and the California Gold Rush came by boat from the Bay Area. In the early 1860s businessmen grew tired of paying taxes at the Sacramento Embarcadero (port). In 1862 Freeport Railroad Company was created with the idea of building a new port that was free of taxes. Hence ‚ÄúFreeport.‚Äù The idea was to build a railway that bypassed Sacramento connecting with the Sacramento Valley Railroad at a midway point between Sacramento and Folsom. The newly formed town boomed for three years with populations reaching 300-400. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP covers an area of 0.04 square miles (0.1 km), all of it land. Demographics The 2010 United States Census reported that Freeport had a population of 38. The population density was 855.4 people per square mile (330.3/km). The racial makeup of Freeport was 34 (89.5%) White, 0 (0.0%) African American, 0 (0.0%) Native American, 2 (5.3%) Asian, 0 (0.0%) Pacific Islander, 1 (2.6%) from other races, and 1 (2.6%) from two or more races.

The concept was coined by Constantin Carath√©odoryConstantin Carath√©odory: Untersuchungen √ºber die Grundlagen der Thermodynamik, Math. Ann., 67:355‚Äì386, 1909 in 1909 (\\"adiabatische Erreichbarkeit\\") and taken up 90 years later by Elliott Lieb and J. Yngvason in their axiomatic approach to the foundations of thermodynamics. It was also used by R. Giles in his 1964 monograph.Robin Giles: \\"Mathematical Foundations of Thermodynamics\\", Pergamon, Oxford 1964 Description A system in a state Y is said to be adiabatically accessible from a state X if X can be transformed into Y without the system suffering transfer of energy as heat or transfer of matter. X may, however, be transformed to Y by doing work on X. For example, a system consisting of one kilogram of warm water is adiabatically accessible from a system consisting of one kilogram of cool water, since the cool water may be mechanically stirred to warm it. However, the cool water is not adiabatically accessible from the warm water, since no amount or type of work may be done to cool it. Carath√©odory The original definition of Carath√©odory was limited to reversible, quasistatic process, described by a curve in the manifold of equilibrium states of the system under consideration. He called such a state change adiabatic if the infinitesimal 'heat' differential form \\\\delta Q=dU-\\\\sum p_idV_i vanishes along the curve. In other words, at no time in the process does heat enter or leave the system. Carath√©odory's formulation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics then takes the form: \\"In the neighbourhood of any initial state, there are states which cannot be approached arbitrarily close through adiabatic changes of state.\\" From this principle he derived the existence of entropy as a state function S whose differential dS is proportional to the heat differential form \\\\delta Q, so it remains constant under adiabatic state changes (in Carath√©odory's sense). The increase of entropy during irreversible processes is not obvious in this formulation, without further assumptions. Lieb and Yngvason The definition employed by Lieb and Yngvason is rather different since the state changes considered can be the result of arbitrarily complicated, possibly violent, irreversible processes and there is no mention of 'heat' or differential forms. In the example of the water given above, if the stirring is done slowly, the transition from cool water to warm water will be quasistatic. However, a system containing an exploded firecracker is adiabatically accessible from a system containing an unexploded firecracker (but not vice versa), and this transition is far from quasistatic. Lieb and Yngvason's definition of adiabatic accessibility is: A state Y is adiabatically accessible from a state X, in symbols X\\\\prec Y (pronounced X 'precedes' Y), if it is possible to transform X into Y in such a way that the only net effect of the process on the surroundings is that a weight has been raised or lowered (or a spring is stretched/compressed, or a flywheel is set in motion). Thermodynamic entropy A definition of thermodynamic entropy can be based entirely on certain properties of the relation \\\\prec of adiabatic accessibility that are taken as axioms in the Lieb-Yngvason approach. In the following list of properties of the \\\\prec operator, a system is represented by a capital letter, e.g. X, Y or Z. A system X whose extensive parameters are multiplied by \\\\lambda is written \\\\lambda X. (e.g. for a simple gas, this would mean twice the amount of gas in twice the volume, at the same pressure.) A system consisting of two subsystems X and Y is written (X,Y). If X \\\\prec Y and Y \\\\prec X are both true, then each system can access the other and the transformation taking one into the other is reversible. This is an equivalence relationship written X \\\\overset{\\\\underset{\\\\mathrm{A}}{}}{\\\\sim} Y. Otherwise, it is irreversible. Adiabatic accessibility has the following properties: *Reflexivity: X \\\\overset{\\\\underset{\\\\mathrm{A}}{}}{\\\\sim} X *Transitivity: If X \\\\prec Y and Y \\\\prec Z then X \\\\prec Z *Consistency: if X \\\\prec X' and Y \\\\prec Y' then (X,Y) \\\\prec (X',Y') *Scaling Invariance: if \\\\lambda > 0 and X \\\\prec Y then \\\\lambda X \\\\prec \\\\lambda Y *Splitting and Recombination: X\\\\overset{\\\\underset{\\\\mathrm{A}}{}}{\\\\sim}((1-\\\\lambda)X,\\\\lambda X) for all 0 < \\\\lambda < 1 *Stability: if \\\\lim_{\\\\epsilon \\\\to 0} [(X,\\\\epsilon Z_0) \\\\prec (Y,\\\\epsilon Z_1)] then X \\\\prec Y The entropy has the property that S(X)\\\\leq S(Y) if and only if X\\\\prec Y and S(X)= S(Y) if and only if X \\\\overset{\\\\underset{\\\\mathrm{A}}{}}{\\\\sim} Y in accord with the Second Law. If we choose two states X_0 and X_1 such that X_0 \\\\prec X_1 and assign entropies 0 and 1 respectively to them, then the entropy of a state X where X_0 \\\\prec X \\\\prec X_1 is defined as: :S(X) = \\\\sup (\\\\lambda : ((1-\\\\lambda)X_0, \\\\lambda X_1) \\\\prec X) Sources References translated from Andr√© Thess: Das Entropieprinzip - Thermodynamik f√ºr Unzufriedene, Oldenbourg-Verlag 2007, .

It is the second most luminous star in the Quintuplet cluster after WR 102hb. With a luminosity of 2,500,000 times solar, it is also one of the most luminous stars known. Despite the high luminosity it can only be observed at infra-red wavelengths due to the dimming effect of intervening dust on visual light. It is an evolved massive star which has an emission line spectrum from a strong stellar wind caused by high luminosity and the presence of elements heavier than hydrogen in the photosphere. The spectrum is dominated by ionised helium and nitrogen lines due to convectional and rotational mixing of fusion products to the surface of the star. However it is still in a core hydrogen burning phase and hydrogen lines are also visible in the spectrum, in contrast to WN stars without hydrogen which are older, less massive, and less luminous. Despite being a relatively unevolved star, WR 102ea has lost over half its mass already.
