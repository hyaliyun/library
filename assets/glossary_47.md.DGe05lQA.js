Her early research interest included building psychophysical models that examine 4 different visual processes. She has focused in particular on the portions of visual processing that are \\"far from the input end (the light hitting the retina) and also far from the output end (conscious perception and control of action).\\" In 1989, she published her book Visual Pattern Analyzers, which investigated different channels in visual perception that are sensitive to different frequency ranges and orientation, and the development of multidimensional signal detection theory.

Mathilde is a song by Jacques Brel with music by G√©rard Jouannest. It was one of the five tracks appearing on the B-side of his eighth album, Ces gens-l√† (Those people), released in 1966 on a 10-inch record (ref. 80 222s) It is what Brel himself called a \\"monster\\" (a master song of his album). It was one of his favourite songs of his own repertoire, about which he said \\"That song's really good. Structurally speaking, it's well- written.\\" The music was composed by G√©rard Jouannest. Brel performed it for the first time in public on 23 July 1963 at Knokke Casino. The concert was filmed by Belgian television.. The song became the one Brel performed as last song in concerts the following years.  Lyrics  Jacques, the narrator, having learnt about the return of Mathilde, a former lover with whom he had a painful relationship, feeling once more inexorably taken over by passion, calls on many of those close to him: his mother (\\"Mother, now's the time to pray for my soul\\" and later on \\"Mother, stop praying, your Jacques's going back to hell\\"); a maid called Maria who, we might guess, has been an occasional lover (\\"You the maid, you Maria, you'd better change our bed sheets...\\"); a bougnat (coalman and barkeeper) (\\"Bougnat, put away your wine, tonight I'll drink from my sorrow...\\"); his friends (\\"My friends, don't leave me, tonight I'm going back to the front...\\"). He also brings up different parts of his body which symbolise his feelings: his heart (\\"... My heart, stop racing, remember she tore you apart...\\"), his hands (\\"And you my hands, tremble no more, remember when I cried on you...\\"). His pleas will prove vain. The line between love and hate is tenuous (Jacques goes from \\"damned Mathilde\\" to \\"my beautiful Mathilde\\"), and he knows from the start that she will come back to him, though he has loved her as much as she has hurt him. Mathilde's return will spark new passions and new torments. Like Marieke and Madeleine, Mathilde is a song about passionate love for a woman whose name begins with \\"M\\".  Covers  * In 1968, Mort Shuman and Eric Blau translated the lyrics into English for their musical revue Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris, with Shuman performing the song in the show and on the cast recording. Scott Walker also recorded this English version on his first solo album the previous year. * In 1974, the song was covered by Claude Nougaro, (album R√©cr√©ation) who replaced \\"Your Jacques\\" with \\"Your Claude\\" in the line \\"Your Jacques's going back to hell\\". * In 2006, it was featured in Juliette Gr√©co's cover album: Le Temps d'une chanson.

Benson was also an accomplished figure skater, winning the Canadian Junior Singles Figure Skating championship in 1928 and placed third the same year in the Senior Singles division. Career =WWII= At the outbreak of the Second World War, Benson joined the \\"Wrens\\", the Women's Royal Canadian Naval Service as a petty officer, creating a photographic documentary at the Basic Training Establishment in Galt, now Cambridge, Ontario with over 3000. =Montreal Camera Club= Following her honourable discharge, Benson pursued her photographic hobby by studying for a year at the Vermont School of Photography. Upon her return to Montreal she became an active member of the Montreal Camera Club in 1936, eventually serving as the club's first female president from 1965-67. =Kingston Photographic Club= In 1970, Benson moved to Kingston, Ontario, and became a member of the Kingston Photographic Club.

He was first diagnosed by Leo Kanner, and was labeled as \\"Case 1\\". Triplett was noted for his savant abilities, particularly the ability to name musical notes played on a piano, and the ability to perform rapid mental multiplication. Early life Donald Triplett was born to Beamon and Mary Triplett. Initially, Donald was a deeply introverted child who did not respond to his parents' gestures or voices. His language was unusual, he did not play with other children, and he seemed distant from others. Triplett was institutionalized at three years of age, but his parents pulled him out one year later. His father, Beamon, described him as socially withdrawn but interested in number patterns, music notes, letters of the alphabet, and U.S. president pictures. By the age of 2, he had the ability to recite the 23rd Psalm in the Old Testament and memorized 25 questions and answers from some unspecified Presbyterian catechism (likely either the Westminster Larger or Shorter Catechism). He was also interested in creating musical chords. When the Tripletts went to Baltimore, Maryland to meet with Leo Kanner, he was eventually diagnosed him with autism. Education and adult life The diagnosis of Donald Triplett would lead to the complex history of autism, which involved many conflicts among autism personnel and advocates. However, Donald Triplett and his family were distant from all this. He was enrolled in the local high school, where his teachers and classmates were accepting, and in 1958 he graduated with a Bachelor's degree in French from Millsaps College. Later, he returned to his supportive hometown where he worked at the bank that was owned by his family. He learned to drive and traveled around the world in his spare time. Legacy Triplett was tracked down by John Donvan and Caren Zucker so they could find out his life's story for an article \\"Autism's First Child\\" in The Atlantic.

There were 1,500 delegates that participated in the congress and included 700 delegates with a decisive vote rights, 200 had consultative vote rights, and the rest were guests and invited participants.

The purpose and preparation of Congress  The All-Ukrainian National Congress was convened on April 6‚Äì8, 1917 in Kyiv. Its importance was determined by the very purpose of convening the forum - to make the Central Rada the governing body of the Ukrainian national movement and to expand its social base, to refocus the priorities of activities from cultural and educational to state-centered. = The growth of the national movement = During the month of the revolution, after a series of national demonstrations, and in particular the Freedom Day in Kyiv, the Ukrainian liberation movement gained such a magnitude that the Ukrainian Central Rada, in its original composition, could no longer count on its successful leadership. All Ukrainian society of that time, its leadership, also felt the need to transform the Central Rada into a more authoritative and competent body than the one created in early March 1917, mainly by representatives of Kyiv NGOs. At the same time, leading politicians wanted to demonstrate in a unique way their potential on an all-Ukrainian scale and to identify with the support of a reputable national body the principle line of the national liberation struggle, which inevitably became more evident. = Organization of the congress = The first notice of the convening of the congress was published on March 19, 1917, in the newspaper \\"Visti from the Ukrainian Central Council\\". On March 28, the ¬´Kievskaya Mysl¬ª newspaper published a program of the congress and instructions for its election, prepared by Mikhaylo Hrushevsky. The congress is scheduled for Easter holidays - April 6, 7, 8 (Thursday, Friday and Saturday of Easter). The leaders of the Central Rada intended to hold a congress on the principles of territorial representation with the participation of all regions of Ukraine in order to transform the organization into a nationwide one. In his article \\"On the All-Ukrainian Congress\\", published on March 29, 1917, Mykhailo Hrushevsky called on Ukrainians and non- Ukrainians \\"of all regions, territories and nooks and crannies of our national territory standing on the Ukrainian political platform\\" to take an active part in its work, which will contribute to the successful fulfillment of its expectations. The author emphasized: ¬´The central task of the congress is to complete our organization. The Central Rada, created in Kyiv by representatives of all Kyiv strata and supplemented by delegates of extracurricular organizations, is now recognized as a central Ukrainian government by all Ukrainian conscious people. The congress should give it the latest form, select it in its permanent composition‚Ä¶ in a word, systematize and bring to the system and order an all-Ukrainian national organization¬ª [1] The preparation of the forum took place under intense circumstances. There were rumors throughout the city that the Central Rada could be dispersed by military force to prevent the National Congress from being convened and Ukraine's autonomy proclaimed. At a meeting with the Kyiv Executive Committee, Mykhailo Hrushevsky and Dmitry Antonovich expressed the desire of Ukrainian Central Council to build their activities on a legal basis and assured that the Congress did not aim to proclaim the autonomy of Ukraine. At the time, they considered this case a task of the future. = The hidden purpose of the Congress = However, in his memoirs, Mikhaylo Hrushevsky, in his memoirs, cites some facts that reveal the \\"internal logic\\" of congressional preparation. The Chairman of the Central Rada noted that the initiators of the action wanted to conduct it as soon as possible in order to document the seriousness and inaccessibility of the Ukrainian social claims to the central government: ¬´The Provisional Government tended to postpone everything to the Constituent Assembly and packed Ukrainian business there in the complex of the national question altogether.But it recognized the cases of Finland, Poland, the Caucasus noon so clear to himself that it thought it possible to immediately decree his political rights to them, without waiting for the Constituent Assembly. So, we needed to demonstrate the nation-wide imperative nature of Ukrainian claims, perhaps vividly and unequivocally‚Ä¶ Through the heads of our Kyiv enemies and slanderers, we needed to show not only the Provisional Government, but all Russian citizenship, that our claims are common, popular and the people await their fulfillment impatiently, take every wire to heart, and joke with such a delay \\"to the Constituent Assembly,\\" which, when unknown, is not entirely safe.¬ª  Composition and participants  From March 28 until the moment of the convening of the Congress Ukrainian newspapers regularly covered the topic of the convening of April 6, 1917, national Congress, the norms of representation in it and the printed proposed program. In particular, it was emphasized: ¬´Representatives should be sent by all Ukrainian organizations, political, cultural, professional, territorial, which accept the claim of broad national-territorial autonomy of Ukraine and the fullness of political and cultural Ukrainian life, that is: party organizations; societies cultural, educational and economic; working, peasant, military, clergy, clerks, youth of all schools; villages, towns and counties organizations.¬ª [3] = Conditions for participation in the meeting = If the number of members of the organization did not exceed 50, it had the right to send one delegate with a decisive vote, more than 50 - respectively two, more than 100 - three, 200 - four, 300 five (but no more). With an advisory vote, any \\"organized Ukrainian\\" could take part in the Congress, with the permission of the Presidium. This system was developed personally by Mikhail Hrushevsky. In his \\"Memories\\" he wrote: ¬´‚Ä¶ For the —Åongress I created a system of mixed representation, so that in addition to the representation of the national, there was something from the representation of the territorial. Representation was given to Ukrainian national organizations - from every ten Ukrainians organized in any organization, one representative could be sent to the congress; but one representative could send each village community , whatever it wanted, every factory and every military unit. Only such representatives, who are given written mandates, will have the right to cast a decisive vote at the congress - we have emphasized that the tributaries should not be treated as arbitrary and irresponsible gathering - all other guests will be non-voting guests at the congress.¬ª [4] = Arrival of guests and delegates = The organizers feared that due to poor awareness, poor transport performance, and possibly low political activity of the Ukrainian Congress, it would not be sufficiently representative. However, these expectations were not met. The Congress was widely represented by delegates from all Ukrainian provinces, different sections of the population, many political parties (USSR, USDP, UPSF, UPP, social movements, peasant unions, student communities, cooperative organizations). Representatives of Ukrainian communities of Petrograd, Moscow, Kuban, Voronezh region, Bessarabia, Saratov and other territories outside Ukraine also attended the meeting. In total, about 1500 participants (delegates with a decisive and advisory vote, as well as guests) registered. Famous Ukrainian cultural and social figures - Mykhailo Hrushevsky, Volodymyr Vinnychenko, Serhiy Yefremov, Ilya Shrag, Petro Stebnytsky, Lyudmila Staritska-Chernyakhivska, Dmytro Doroshenko, Motepan, took the honorary place among the delegates who arrived at the congress. However, the most important role in this assembly was played by a small element - peasants, soldiers and workers. Together with the intelligentsia and the student youth, they became aware and proudly called themselves \\"Ukrainians\\" for the shortest time. In some ways - intuitively, and in some - consciously, but unconditionally infusing into the ranks of the movement, they thus irrevocably gave him a mass national-political orientation and character. This fact has touched even, for the most part, always academically cold, Hrushevsky: ¬´The sincere impulse immediately united and merged into a single body this multi-thousand-strong community that gathered from different parts of Ukraine for the first time at a large national assembly.¬ª [5  The course of the All-Ukrainian Congress  The meetings of the All-Ukrainian Congress were held in Kyiv in the hall of the Merchant Assembly (now the National Philharmonic of Ukraine, Volodymyr Uzviz, 2). All the work of the congress was a vivid manifestation of strong national unity, a confident transformation of a diverse and diverse army of delegates into a clear, well-defined, purposeful representative body of the nation. The activity of delegates can be characterized as turbulent - in three days more than 300 public speeches took place, not counting the huge number (more than 350) of greetings received at the congress from almost all corners of Ukraine and from beyond its borders. [6] However, the slogans \\"Ukraine for Ukrainians\\" and \\"Independent Ukraine\\" were considered dangerous, \\"Ukrainian autonomy in the Federal Republic of Russia\\" being the most popular. [7] The soul of the forum was Mikhail Hrushevsky, who opened the congress. He was unanimously elected honorary chairman of the meeting, he was constantly at the epicenter of discussions. The speakers agreed with his position. Grushevsky's ideas and theoretical conclusions were transferred to the approved documents. = The first day (April 6, 1917) = On the first day of the Congress, April 6, 1917, the following topics were announced and discussed: *‚ÄúState law and federal competitions in Ukraine‚Äù (speaker Dmitry Doroshenko); *\\"Federalism. Demand of the Democratic Federal Republic of Russia‚Äù (speaker: Alexander Shulgin); *‚ÄúAutonomy - broad and unlimited, national-territorial and national. Claiming the broad national-territorial autonomy of Ukraine and the rights of national minorities and their security‚Äù (speaker Fedir Matushevsky); At the end of the first day of the Congress, at the suggestion of Mikhail Hrushevsky, it was read and after taking into account some amendments, unanimously adopted resolutions that embodied the Ukrainian mood at that time: [8] ¬´1. In accordance with the historical traditions and modern real needs of the Ukrainian people, the Congress considers that only the national-territorial autonomy of Ukraine will meet the needs of our people and all other nationalities living on Ukrainian land. 2\\\\. The autonomous system of Ukraine, as well as other autonomous countries of Russia, will have full guarantees for themselves in the federal system. 3\\\\. Therefore, the only appropriate form of government is the Congress considers the Federal Russian Democratic Republic. 4\\\\. And one of the main principles of Ukrainian autonomy is the full protection of the rights of national minorities living in Ukraine.¬ª The next day, the congress approved an annex to the fourth item of the resolution: ¬´The Congress recognizes the necessity that in those countries of the Federal Russian Republic in which the Ukrainian people constitute a minority of the population, the Ukrainian people are guaranteed minority rights under the same conditions as those in Ukraine provided for minority rights of non- Ukrainians.¬ª = Second day (April 7, 1917) = On April 7, the congress delegates heard the reports: * \\"The main reasons for the organization of Ukrainian autonomy\\" (Mykhailo Tkachenko) * ¬´Method and procedure of actual creation of autonomy of Ukraine¬ª (Fedor Kryzhanovsky) *\\"On the Territory and Population of Autonomous Ukraine\\" (Valentin Sadovsky) *‚ÄúOn Ensuring the Rights of National Minorities‚Äù (P. Ponyatenko) *\\"Specific Ukrainian claims to the Provisional Government\\" (S. Kolos) As a result of the following considerations and provisions, the resolution was adopted following the results of the second day of Congress: [8] ¬´1) The Ukrainian National Congress, recognizing the Russian Constituent Assembly the right to sanction a new polity in Russia, including the autonomy of Ukraine, and the federal system of the Russian Republic, believes, however, that prior to the convening of the Russian Constituent Assembly supporters of the new order in Ukraine cannot remain passive, but in agreement with the smaller peoples of Ukraine, they must immediately create the grounds for her autonomous life. 2) The Ukrainian Congress, meeting the wishes of the Provisional Government on the organization and unification of public forces, recognizes the urgent need to organize a Local Council (Regional Council) of representatives of Ukrainian territories and cities, nationalities and social groups, to which the Ukrainian Central Council must take the initiative. 3) The Ukrainian Congress, recognizing the right of all nations to political self-determination, considers: a) that the borders between states should be established in accordance with the will of border people; b) that in order to ensure this, it is necessary that, in addition to the representatives of the belligerent states, the representatives of those peoples on the territory of which war is taking place, including Ukraine, should be admitted to a peace conference.¬ª Although Mykhailo Hrushevsky later criticized the level of the papers delivered and discussed them, the academic form of the national congress proved to be quite productive, given the conditions under which the Ukrainian Revolution took place. This form, on the one hand, helped to effectively enrich the liberation movement with the latest theoretical assets, to outline the line of struggle, and on the other - to immediately test to the general public how well the course of the revolution was chosen. The Congress convincingly demonstrated that the autonomy-federalist orientations prevailed in the Ukrainian environment almost indivisibly. Few supporters of self-views had every reason to be seriously disappointed. [9] On the same day, congratulations were heard with representatives of different organizations and regions not only of Ukraine, but also of other peoples - Russian, Polish, Jewish, Estonian. * The newspapers solemnly described the second day of the meeting as \\"a day of unforgettably majestic brotherhood of representatives of almost all peoples of Russia\\", in which \\"the mood of all non-state nations seeking freedom\\" was reflected. [10] = The third day (April 8, 1917) = The last day of the Congress was devoted to holding elections to the Central Rada. Mikhail Hrushevsky twice (April 7 and April 8) reported on the principles of the election, the norms of representation, which were approved after the discussion. Initially by secret ballot, at the insistence of Hrushevsky, the Chairman of the Central Rada was elected, then - openly - two of his deputies and, finally, - deputies of the Rada.  Election  The election of the Ukrainian Central Rada head began with a standing ovation: ¬´We have a head¬ª, ¬´Father Grushevsky is our head¬ª. [7] However, at the insistence of Mikhail Hrushevsky, the formal procedure was adhered to: the Ukrainian Central Rada chairman was elected virtually unanimously (by 588 votes, 5 votes were cast for each of the contenders nominated by the congress and also ran for this high post). Volodymyr Vynnychenko and Sergei Yefremov were elected Vice- Presidents.–°–æ–ª–¥–∞—Ç–µ–Ω–∫–æ –í. –§. –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∞ —Ä–µ–≤–æ–ª—é—Ü—ñ—è. –Ü—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—á–Ω–∏–π –Ω–∞—Ä–∏—Å: –ú–æ–Ω–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ—ñ—è. ‚Äî –ö.: –õ–∏–±—ñ–¥—å, 1999. ‚Äî —Å. 151 The Congress elected 115 deputies to the Central Rada:–•–º—ñ–ª—å –Ü. –í. –ù–∞ —à–ª—è—Ö—É –≤—ñ–¥—Ä–æ–¥–∂–µ–Ω–Ω—è —É–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–æ—ó –¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–≤–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—ñ (–£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∏–π –Ω–∞—Ü—ñ–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–∏–π –∫–æ–Ω–≥—Ä–µ—Å-–∑'—ó–∑–¥ 6-8 –∫–≤—ñ—Ç–Ω—è 1917 —Ä–æ–∫—É) ‚Äî –ö., 1989. ‚Äî —Å. 47-50 \\\\- from educational and other organizations of the city of Kyiv - 13; \\\\- from Kyiv military organizations - 8; \\\\- from cooperative organizations, the Peasant Union, teachers and students - 5 each; \\\\- from the Ukrainian Women's Union - 1; \\\\- from the Union of Ukrainian Autonomists-Federalists - 5; \\\\- from USDRP - 4; \\\\- from the USSR and the UDDP - 3 each; \\\\- from Ukrainian People‚Äôs Party - 1; \\\\- from most provincial cities - 3 each; \\\\- from the provinces (except the centers) - 4 deputies each; Ukrainians of Kuban, Bessarabia, Petrograd, Moscow, Rostov, Saratov also received representation in the Central Rada. In total, eight Ukrainian provinces and major cities received 60 seats in the Council, which is more than half. Naturally, the share of the active participants of the liberation movement was high in the composition of the Central Rada (Ivan Steshenko, Lyudmila Staritskaya-Chernyakhivska, Andriy Yakovliv, Dmitry Doroshenko, Vyacheslav Prokopovych, Yevgeny Chikalenko, Fedir Matushevsky, Andriy Nirsnenpsky, Andriy Nirpensky, Mykola Stasyuk, Mykhailo Tkachenko, Valentin Sadovsky, Mykola Mikhnovsky, Mykola Kuzmenko and others). At the same time, many deputy mandates were given to promising young people who did not hesitate to enter the arena of active political activity (Pavel Khristyuk, Mykola Shrag, Mykhailo Eremiev, Levko Chikalenko, Mykola Lyubynsky, Mykola Levitsky, Viktor Pavelko, S. Kolos). It was also decided to unite the agitation and information commission into an organizational one, and its chairman - Dmitry Antonovich - to invite to the Committee by a Comrade of the Chairman.  Formation of the Mala Rada  At the first organizational meeting on April 8, 1917, Mykhailo Hrushevsky proposed to elect an Executive Committee called the Committee of the Ukrainian Central Rada (later called the Mala Rada), consisting of 20 people. It was elected Chairman of the Committee, his deputies Vinnychenko and Efremov, Comrade Chairman - F. Kryzhanivsky, treasurer - V. Koval, secretaries - V. Boyko and S. Veselovsky. = Decision = At the end of the third day of work, the National Congress adopted the following decisions:–•–º—ñ–ª—å –Ü. –í. –ù–∞ —à–ª—è—Ö—É –≤—ñ–¥—Ä–æ–¥–∂–µ–Ω–Ω—è —É–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–æ—ó –¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–≤–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—ñ (–£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–∏–π –Ω–∞—Ü—ñ–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–∏–π –∫–æ–Ω–≥—Ä–µ—Å-–∑'—ó–∑–¥ 6-8 –∫–≤—ñ—Ç–Ω—è 1917 —Ä–æ–∫—É) ‚Äî –ö., 1989. ‚Äî —Å. 44 ¬´1) The Ukrainian National Congress protests against claims made by the Provisional Polish State Council on land claims by the Provisional Polish State Council in a declaration calling on the Provisional Government of the Russian Federation to unite the Polish people with a free Russian state. The Ukrainian people will not tolerate any efforts to seize the rights to the territory of Ukraine. 2) The Ukrainian National Congress, having heard the statements and specific proposals of the Ukrainian delegates of the army and navy, instructs the Central Council to submit those specific requests to the Provisional Government. 3) The Ukrainian National Congress has decided to send greetings to the Ukrainians to the front. 4) The Ukrainian National Congress instructs the Central Rada to take as soon as possible the initiative of the Union of those peoples of Russia who, like Ukrainians, seek national- territorial autonomy on democratic grounds in the Federal Republic of Russia. 5) The Ukrainian National Congress approves the Central Rada to organize a committee of its deputies and representatives of national minorities to develop a draft autonomous statute of Ukraine. This charter must be proposed for approval by the Congress of Ukraine, organized in such a way that it expresses the will of the people of the whole territory of Ukraine. The sanction of the autonomous system of Ukraine is recognized, according to the resolution of the previous days, by the Constituent Assembly. 6) The Ukrainian National Congress, having heard resolutions passed to it from the meeting of the Peasant Union concerning the prohibition, sale and mortgage of land and forests, as well as the long-term lease of underground treasures (coal, ores and others), decides to submit them to the Central Council for a corresponding statement to the Provisional Government.¬ª External links * Khmil, I.

Wang did not go home empty handed that year though, as she teamed up with Ba Dexin to represent China at the 2016 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship. The pair would finish 2nd in their group, having lost only one match, which was good enough to make the playoffs. They would then go on to defeat Denmark, Estonia, and Scotland before losing to Russia in the final, taking home silver medals. Wang would later join the Wang Bingyu rink as her third. They would win a gold medal at the 2017 Asian Winter Games and would represent China at the 2017 World Women's Curling Championship, finishing in 11th place. Wang and Ba represented China in the mixed doubles tournament of the 2018 Winter Olympics, and finished in fifth place. The pair finished the round robin with a 4-3 record, but lost in a tiebreak match against Norway. Wang threw fourth stones for the Chinese women's team in 2019, debuting at the 2019 World Qualification Event, which she won with teammates Mei Jie, Yao Mingyue and Ma Jingyi. This qualified China for the 2019 World Women's Curling Championship, which the team played in.https://nationalpost.com/pmn/sports-pmn/a-capsule-look-at- teams-competing-at-the-world-womens-curling-championship There, the rink finished round robin with a 7-5 record, and then lost in their quarterfinal match against Switzerland.

He served as the Executive Officer of La R√©publique En Marche! and Secretary of State for Relations with Parliament from 2017 to 2018. He served as Spokesperson of the Government under Prime Minister √âdouard Philippe in 2017. He was also spokesperson for Emmanuel Macron during his campaign for the presidential election of 2017. Born in Ollioules in the Var department of the Provence- Alpes-C√¥te d'Azur region, he was a member of the National Assembly for the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence department from 2012 to 2017 and headed the Socialist Party list for the 2015 regional elections in Provence-Alpes-C√¥te d'Azur before joining Macron's En Marche! movement in 2016. He also served as Mayor of Forcalquier from 2001 to 2017 and Vice President of the Regional Council of Provence-Alpes-C√¥te d'Azur from 2004 to 2012. On 18 November 2017, Castaner became the Executive Officer of La R√©publique En Marche! before resigning as Government Spokesman.  Early life and education  The youngest of three children, Christophe Castaner's father was in the military and his mother was a housewife. A poor student, he gained his baccalaur√©at independently (en candidat libre) at the age of 20 in 1986. A graduate of the Faculty of Law and Political Science of the University of Aix-Marseille, he holds a post-graduate diploma in International Business Law and a diploma in Criminal and Criminological Sciences.  Political career  After work experience at the Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) legal department, he was recruited to local government management posts in Avignon and Paris. In 1995 he became office manager for Tony Dreyfus, mayor of the 10th arrondissement of Paris. He was technical adviser to the Minister of Culture, Catherine Trautmann, in 1997 and became her principal private secretary in 1998. He was principal private secretary to Michel Sapin, then Minister of the Civil Service and the State Reform, from 2000 to 2002. = Local government = In 2001 Christophe Castaner stood for mayor of Forcalquier. He won against the incumbent mayor, Pierre Delmar (RPR), who had been mayor from 1983 to 1989 and again from 1995 to 2001 and was also both a national deputy and a departmental councillor. Re- elected as mayor of Forcalquier and president of the district council of Forcalquier-Mount Lure (Communaut√© de communes Pays de Forcalquier - Montagne de Lure) in 2008, he was an active participant in the creation of the intercommunality of the Pays de Haute-Provence.Christophe Castaner biography at the Socialist Party website He was once again re-elected mayor of Forcalquier on 23 March 2014, standing against S√©bastien Ginet (UMP). On 11 April 2014, his vice-president, Pierre Garcin, succeeded him as the president of the district council of Forcalquier-Mount Lure. = Regional government = In 2004, after having been elected to the regional council of Provence-Alpes- C√¥te d'Azur (PACA), he found himself entrusted by the president Michel Vauzelle with responsibility for land use planning. It was the first time this important responsibility fell to an \\"Alpine\\" representative, who was also the youngest vice-president of the PACA region. He was re-elected in 2010 and given a new responsibility: employment, economy, higher education and innovation. Christophe Castaner was named on 5 February 2015 as chief candidate for the 2015 PACA regional elections by members of the Socialist Party with 55% of the vote, ahead of Patrick Allemand (31%) and Elsa di M√©o (14%). In the first round he obtained 17% of the vote, trailing the National Front (40.55%) and The Republicans (26.47%). Following the decision of the Socialist Party, Christophe Castaner decided not to stand in the second round in an act of unity against the National Front. This choice enabled the election of Christian Estrosi with 54.8% of the vote. = National politics =  Deputy for Alpes-de-Haute-Provence  On 17 June 2012, he was elected as a member of the National Assembly for the 2nd constituency of the Alpes de Haute-Provence in the 2012 legislative election, ahead of the UMP candidate, Jean-Claude Castel, mayor of Corbi√®res. A member of the National Assembly's Finance Committee, in July 2012 he was appointed Special Rapporteur of Work and Employment Budgets. On 20 June 2014, Prime Minister Manuel Valls entrusted Christophe Castaner with the vice-presidency of the Council for the Co-ordination of Profit-sharing, Employee Savings and Employee Shareholding (Conseil d'orientation de la participation, de l'int√©ressement, de l'√©pargne salariale et de l'actionnariat salari√© ‚Äî COPIESAS). This authority was in charge of bringing negotiations between unions and management on these measures to a successful conclusion. He sponsored the Bill for Growth, Activity and Equality of Economic Opportunity (Loi pour la croissance, l'activit√© et l'√©galit√© des chances √©conomiques), known as the loi Macron (‚ÄúMacron's law‚Äù). He was spokesperson for and a supporter of Emmanuel Macron during the campaign for the presidential election of 2017. During this campaign, he was repeatedly criticized for dishonesty and tactlessness. He justified his joining with Emmanuel Macron by explaining that in politics one must be \\"at the right place at the right time, without necessarily knowing where you will end up\\". Described as ambitious, he reckons that \\"all politicians have an ego. Or they are liars. Recently, I downloaded La Provence at 5 a.m. to see if my picture was in that day's edition\\". He stood in the 2017 legislative elections on the La R√©publique En Marche! ticket for the 2nd constituency of the Alpes-de-Hautes-Provence and was reelected.  Government Spokesperson and Secretary of State for Relations with Parliament  On 17 May 2017 he was named Secretary of State for Relations with Parliament. He was also appointed as Government Spokesperson for the √âdouard Philippe government. In October 2017, as a result of some arrests, he was named among potential targets of attacks in preparation by far-right activists. Jean-Luc M√©lenchon was also included among the targets. A risk whose seriousness was denied by the Minister of the Interior, G√©rard Collomb, shortly after.  En Marche!  On 25 October 2017, a few days after Emmanuel Macron gave his support, he declared his candidacy for president of the party on RTL radio. It was voted on at the first party convention on 18 November 2017.  Interior Minister  Following Gerard Collomb's resignation as interior minister for the √âdouard Philippe government in early October 2018, Castaner was appointed interior minister on 16 October 2018. A brief handover ceremony at the Interior Ministry was held the same day, and Castaner spoke to journalists citing the issue of security as the Ministry's greatest preoccupation, mentioning the \\"fight against terrorism\\".https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-16/macron-lifts- castaner-into-cabinet-in-limited-ministerial-revamp In the evening, president Macron addressed the French nation in a televised broadcast, in which he announced the nomination of the new interior minister and agriculture minister over a 12 minute-long speech. During the Spring of 2019, Castaner was criticized for his handling of the Gilet Jaune movement. On 9 March 2019, after a day of Gilets Jaune demonstration, Castaner was photographed in a nightclub with a young woman of indeterminate identity. The resulting scandal became a subject of intense embarrassment for the Phillipe government. On 1 May 2019, during the Labour Day manifestations, he announced an attack of the Piti√©-Salp√™tri√®re Hospital by demonstrators, as well as aggression of the nursing staff and a policeman. Videos and testimonies published the next day revealed that what he presented as an attack was in fact peaceful demonstrators trying to escape from police charges. Criticized by journalists and part of the political class, and accused of lying, he recognized that he should not have used the term \\"attack\\". In the aftermath of the Paris police headquarters stabbing Christophe Castaner was criticized for the public statements he had made regarding the motive of the attacker. Castaner had claimed that there were no warning signs prior to the attack in the suspects behavior, while records dating back to 2015 documented several alerts and reports concerning a possible radicalization. Republican spokesman Christian Jacob called for an official inquiry, while other MPs demanded Castaner's resignation.  Political positions  In October 2020, Castaner was one of 48 LREM members who voted in support of a bill introduced by the Ecology Democracy Solidarity parliamentary group that would extend the legal deadline for abortion from 12 to 14 weeks.Elisa Braun (October 9, 2020), Former Macron allies ramp up pressure on green, social agenda Politico Europe.

Despite the early success of GoChat, the app saw its fair share of struggles. Within days of its original release on Google Play and Apple's App Store, GoChat had already amassed millions of active users and was having trouble keeping its servers online. After news of the app went viral, Zarra received many different investment opportunities before accepting funding from angel investor Michael Robertson. Once funded, the app continued to grow to well over 2 million users within its first 2 weeks. GoChat later was acquired and Zarra stepped down as CEO and from the board of directors to pursue other projects. =Wiksi Apps= Zarra then launched The Bulbapedia App under his new mobile software platform \\"Wiksi Apps\\". It was the only app available for Bulbapedia, the online community driven Pok√©mon Encyclopedia. The app was so successful that within 3 days following its release, it was acquired by and made the official app of Bulbapedia. =Short Code Directory= In an effort to combat unwanted SMS text messages, Zarra launched the short code directory.

Its main purpose was to offer an evolved alternative to SMS Marketing by leveraging the billions of users on the Facebook Messenger app directly. In an interview with Forbes, Zarra stated \\"It is our firm belief that an advertisement platform as big as this deserves to be equipped with proper technology to prevent this unwanted abuse of its systems.\\" =Switcher.gg= With the release of the Nintendo Switch and the disappointing online infrastructure, the concept of Switcher.gg was born. In an initial Reddit post, Jonathan was quoted as saying \\"I love Nintendo, but between Nintendo friend code IDs, many games not offering online multiplayer, and the online multiplayer that does exist often being difficult to find new players for, there‚Äôs a real issue here that I believe could use some solving.\\" Within just weeks of the site's release, it grew in popularity and was said to have passed over 40,000 Switch users. The Switch matchmaking website would go on to grow in popularity, spreading throughout the Nintendo community and connecting switch players to this day.

Their initial name was 666. They are considered to be one of the first death metal band from Bangladesh. They are a pioneering band of the East Bengal Extreme Metal scene. Their EP Epitaph of Plassey is widely regarded as one of most influential death metal record in Bangladesh.  History  In 2004, Ahmed Shawki and his friend Saimum Hasan Nahian created a band named 666. It was a bold approach because the band culture of Dhaka was not very much introduced to extreme metal musics like death metal then. Gradually this band became a pioneer of death metal music of Bangladesh. During 2012‚Äì2016, the band was inactive because its vocal Ahmed Shawki left the country and went to Australia. Since then, Riasat Azmi is serving as vocalist of this band. Severe Dementia draws its lyrical themes from ancient and historical events which created a major impact on certain nations and the human race. Their songs provide brutality, blistering speed and technical proficiency in composing. They also introduced aggressive drum blasts, guttural growls and screams and pure aggression rendered guitar lines in their tracks, which were very rare and uncommon in the history of Bangladesh's rock-metal music genre.  Albums and performances  In February 2007, Severe Dementia signed a deal with Demonstealer Records (India) to release an EP in a split album Rise of the Eastern Blood with Demonic Resurrection (India), Dusk (Pakistan) and Helmksey (Singapore). The conceptual EP is entitled as Epitaph of Plassey with 5 continuous songs based on the historical Battle of Plassey between the British East India Company and the Bengal Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah in 1757. Their other tracks are- * Defloracioun of Tiamat (Demo) * Emissaries Of Kingu (Demo) * Shudder Thee Incensed Goddess (Demo) * Slayer Of The Snarling Tormentor (Demo) * The Tormentor * Demented Mentation Severe Dementia undertook a tour in India in April 2007 as being the first ever underground band from Bangladesh to play overseas. The opening of the album took place at the last concert of the tour on April 8, 2007, at Razzberry Rhinoceros, Mumbai. The band played in two shows at Mumbai and Pune. Their next album is going to be in theme of ancient Sumerian mythology. On July 9, 2017 the band revisited India while performing at Kolkata Death Fest (3rd edition) at Jadavpur university Triguna Sen Auditorium, Kolkata.

The workhouse was demolished in 1931, and the site is now occupied by Liverpool's Catholic cathedral. History Initial construction of the workhouse was completed in May 1772. It was extended by addition of six further houses to both the southeast and southwest wings in 1777, a public dispensary (completed in 1780), four houses to form a hospital for casual paupers (1786), a lunatic asylum (1787), and a fever ward (1801). By the 1790s, the workhouse accommodated over 1000 people, and further extensions were added in 1792 and 1796. A report in 1805 by churchwarden Henderson revealed that of 1600 paupers housed in the workhouse and nearby almshouses, only 20 were able-bodied men, with 437 unable to work due to sickness or infirmity. The workhouse was expanded (effectively rebuilt) in the 1840s (to designs by architects Henry Lockwood and Thomas Allom), with a chapel erected in 1855 and a hospital 'for the reception of poor persons suffering from infectious diseases' added in 1863. At its peak it was one of the largest workhouses in the UK with an official capacity of over 3000 inmates but sometimes holding as many as 5000. Nurse training The workhouse also housed one of the largest infirmaries in the country. It catered for 1200 sick paupers. Liverpool philanthropist William Rathbone obtained permission from the Liverpool Vestry to introduce trained nurses (at his own expense for three years) at the workhouse hospital in 1864, and invited Agnes Jones, then at the London Great Northern Hospital, to be the first trained Nursing Superintendent in 1865. The conditions in the infirmary when she arrived were described as \\"disorder, extravagance of every description in the establishment to an incredible degree\\". Soon after she arrived, Jones brought 12 trained nurses and seven probationers (all trained at the Nightingale School of Nursing in London) to the infirmary. This initial group were supplemented by further probationers and 54 able-bodied female inmates who were paid a small salary. This was the first training for nurses in any workhouse infirmary, paving the way for nurse training systems in other workhouses across the UK; social reformer Eva McLaren was among those trained there as a nurse. Closure The need for the workhouse and its hospital gradually reduced during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the institution closing in the late 1920s and the site being put up for sale in 1930. Acquired by the Roman Catholic church, the workhouse was demolished in 1931 and the site is today occupied by the Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral.

The conflict involved an attack by Russian forces on a defensive position held by a numerically stronger Ottoman Turk force. The outcome was a Russian victory which enabled their ongoing Balkan campaign to proceed unhindered. Background The Russo-Turkish wars had been taking place intermittently throughout the second half of the 1700s, interrupted latterly by pressure from Napoleon. In 1810 hostilities were resumed, and the Russians put Count Nikolay Kamensky in command of the Army of the Danube with orders to drive the Ottoman Turks out of the Balkan peninsula. In June Kamensky crossed the Danube into northern Bulgaria. In August he sent part of his force under General L√∂wis to capture the town of Razgrad to protect his flank while he besieged the strongly fortified town of Shumen. There he suffered a setback when the Turks counter-attacked, not helped by the fact that L√∂wis's troops took a wrong road on their return. He therefore left his brother Sergei Kamensky with 30,000 men to control Shumen and led the rest of his army to attack the more important Danubian port of Rustchuk (now Ruse). In the meantime the Ottoman Turks had amassed a strong force in western Bulgaria and were advancing towards them along the south bank of the Danube. Battle of Batin In early August the advancing Turkish led army, some 40,000 strong, clashed with Russian troops under General Ouvarov who had been sent to delay them. Ouvarov retreated before them but to his surprise the Turks halted their advance and dug in. Kamensky contacted his brother at Shumen and ordered him to meet him at Batin with 10,000 of his men and, having left a force to guard Rustchuk, set off with 10,000 of his own men to the rendezvous. The fighting commenced in earnest on 9 September 1810. Kamensky's men formed columns and made a frontal attack up a slope on the Turkish camp. When the attack stalled Kamensky sent his cavalry round the enemy's right flank to attack the Turkish position from the rear. His brother Sergei had meanwhile slipped round their left flank with his cavalry and also attacked from behind. The confusion allowed the frontal attack to press home causing the Turkish morale to break and many Turks to flee. The camp, its commander and artillery pieces were captured. However Muchtar Pasha, son of the infamous Ali Pasha of Ioannina, managed to escape unharmed with some 4,000 Albanian cavalry. Aftermath The Russians had lost some 1,500 men but the Turks had lost 5,000 killed, had 5,000 taken prisoner and suffered the scattering of their army. Kamensky was free to return to Rustchuk to complete the siege and capture of the town. However he was taken irrecoverably ill in February 1811, dying in May, and was temporarily succeeded by Count Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron.

Foreign threats in the postwar Polish propaganda ‚Äì the influence and the reception of the communist mediaIn Memoriam ‚Äì William W. Biddle Although details of his personal life are rare in written records, he made contributions to the field of psychology by developing frameworks in propaganda, education, and community development. Biddle outlined in his writings that propaganda was a form of persuasion for coercing people, illustrating examples from times of war. He established that education systems should develop each individual's intelligence and focus on critical thinking to avoid autistic thinking. Biddle defined and established various community development programs with a focus on environment, descriptive studies, politics, religion, and educational process. There are several noted achievements in his lifetime. His 1931 article \\"A Psychological Definition of Propaganda\\" was one of the early psychological works on the subject of propaganda.The State Historical Society of Missouri He was one of the earliest practitioners of community development in the United States. His book The Community Development Process, written in collaboration with his wife Loureide J. Biddle, was translated into several languages. His written work was consistent with the traditional American values of self help, fair play, and cooperation within the community. For several years, he directed a program at Earlham College known as Community Dynamics.  Contributions to Psychology  = Work on Propaganda = Biddle was one of the earliest practitioners of developing psychological frameworks for propaganda. He illustrated that propaganda is an understated form of persuasion that utilizes multiple methodologies of coercing people. These methods include: persuasion by way of regulating people‚Äôs ideas through rational arguments; appealing to emotion through the use of sentiments and ideas pertaining to emotion; direct suggestion through using repetition in slogans or phrases; and indirectly appealing to emotion through cloaking propaganda as entertainment or news media coverage. He emphasized the importance of the propagandist being hidden when conveying their messages. Whenever a propagandist is unable to keep themselves hidden, the focus of attention on the propaganda will start to shift towards the emotional ideas and desired conduct of the perceiver through the use of direct suggestions. Propaganda during war Periods of war are often littered with all sorts of propaganda. Biddle articulated that during times of war, propaganda can be used to uphold attitudes and morale in favour of ‚Äúour side‚Äù versus the ‚Äúenemy.‚Äù During times of war, propaganda would gradually become more compelling to observers. With this, there were four standard rules that were created for the use of propaganda during war times. The first rule was that propaganda should try to avoid argumentation and should instead apply to specific emotions. The second rule was that propaganda should aim to fit certain situations into the arrangement of ‚Äúus‚Äù versus ‚Äúthe enemy.‚Äù The third rule states that propaganda should motion to apply to certain social groups and not just individuals. The fourth rule highlights the importance of hiding the propagandist from the public. While there has been confusion as to the proper formation of the rules, the second rule is most often well-agreed upon. Propaganda after war After wars have concluded, propaganda still has lasting effects. Biddle demonstrated that during these periods, propaganda would put special emphasis on appealing to emotional themes and motifs in order to avert past the logical, thought-provoking arguments created from using propaganda. He detailed two types of emotional responses associated with propaganda: positive and negative. The importance of conveying a radical version of these emotional responses was explained as well. The propagandist should either convey a strong positive response to elicit feelings of enjoyment, enthusiasm, and love; or they should aim to convey a strong negative response to evoke feelings of avoidance, fear, and dislike. The process of conveying these emotions through propaganda works to separate those in favor from those against the subject of the propaganda. Differentiating the ‚Äúenemy‚Äù from ‚Äúwe,‚Äù a blockage associated with negativism and distrust is created that makes it more difficult to accept facts stemming from the ‚Äúenemy,‚Äù regardless of how rational or logical an argument may be. Biddle simply put this phenomenon as a tendency to believe that there is always an opposing force that has views directly averse to that of ‚Äúwe.‚Äù = Work on Community Development = Biddle argues that there are varied differences in how community development is defined due to differences in the types of programs used as a means to work with people. Firstly, differences in the definition can be noted in the types of populations served. An example of a type of population served includes one‚Äôs own nation focusing on lowest to middle class backgrounds. The method of work done among rural versus urban communities can also differ causing an impact on how we define and perceive community development. Defining and re- defining Community Development Biddle argues that the approach, population served, and other factors are important characteristics of community development and how it is defined. It can be seen as something that is solely for improving rural areas or developing urban areas distinctively. Community is difficult to define, therefore developing one cannot be simply understood according to Biddle. Biddle states that a community developer undertakes pro- social programs to meet people‚Äôs needs that includes a variety of programs such as building economy, social welfare, community organization, public health, education, and recreation. There are various formulas mentioned for the process of community development with many causes. Biddle states that it would become the human phase of every improvement effort. Biddle gives a proposal on the redefinition of community development and also gives his own definition of community development. He argues that even though it may be defined by the program that bears the name, it can be shaped on the other part without forcing on the monotony of agreement. Biddle thinks that all approaches for the present are legitimate contributions, where each interpreter should state their own concepts, purposes, and even biases. Each interpreter can then find their position in the grand scheme of community development, and learn from other peoples' experiences in contrast programs. Through the whole period of the study, everyone should try to find the central core or common denominator among the many varieties. Biddle gives his own definition of community development as a social process which focuses on personality growth through group responsibility. Human beings become more competent and get the control over local aspects of a frustrating and changing world. Biddle argues that most interpreters give major attention to other objectives, saying that human development is basic citizen participation and achievement of local initiative. After this common core, community development will be more clearly distinguished from community organization, instructional adult education, and programs that would mobilize people to serve political objectives. Forms of Community Development (CD): To Biddle, there are five different forms or programs or methods of community development: improvement of environment, descriptive studies, political emphasis, religious emphasis, and educational process. 1.CD on improving the environment Community development programs that focus on improving the environment assume that having stronger social living and social services will ultimately be of benefit to the inhabitants of a community. Programs aimed at improving the environment usually consists of trying to improve the economy along with the natural environment of the community. 2.CD on descriptive studies Programs of a more descriptive nature differ from programs that look for social and economic improvement by way of utilizing methods of measuring public opinion in order to survey life living in a community. 3.CD with political emphasis Programs with a political emphasis come in a few different forms. There are programs that seek to develop a sense of pressure that affects public officials. This style of program aims to gain political leverage and power. There are also programs that have a goal of strengthening government authority. This would encompass any development programs that offer support for a political figure or ideology. Finally, there are programs in place that aid in the planning of cities or regions. Usually, programs of this nature are endorsed by some form of political authority and often seek to gain public support for the vision of the future that is proposed by the program. 4.CD with religious emphasis A religious emphasis is another point of interest for community development programs. Typically, these programs are connected to a political goal of a religious nature. Programs in this respect often offer a mission pertaining to the promotion of democracy or they offer a compromise between competing interests and ideologies in a community. For a compromise between opposing ideologies to occur in a community, faith in the effectiveness of the community‚Äôs social processes is encouraged in order to bring about a compromise between opposing interests through developing a mutual respect to each competing interest. 5.CD with educational focus The final form of community development programs takes an educational focus. The underlying assumption for some community developers with this goal is to include community development into the educational curriculum as a teachable skill or multiple skills. There are also some community developers who are of the mind that community development is actually an open, continuous educational process that is passed down from generation to generation. The collective development of people pertaining to personality and behaviour in general is the driving goal to these types of community developers.  Temptations for the Community Developer  Biddle outlines the important duty that the developer, known as the \\"encourager\\", has on the group for development. With the goal of community development being the betterment of people, the criterion for evaluation in community development is what happens to the people as a result. According to Biddle, the role of the developer is to encourage and help individuals develop themselves toward a greater ethical citizenship. In times of success, the developers‚Äô joy should not overshadow the evaluation of the development in terms of the people‚Äôs progress. The developer must remain objective and keep the progress going. In times of failure, it is important to avoid discouragement. Throughout the process, Biddle articulates that the developer diminishes in power, and the power is transferred to the group members once they have gained enough strength to carry on the process. To Biddle, community development is an educational experience, where the developer acts as a balance wheel to keep the process going. In the end, the success of the developer lies in the success of the group. = Work on Education = Biddle believed that the education system should ‚Äúseek out and develop the intelligence of each individual to its limit‚Äù. He described the education systems as only teaching students what is right and wrong and failed to teach them critical thinking, which makes the students think \\"autistically\\" and prone to more propaganda. Autistic thinking arises from two deficiencies in education: the lack of sufficient information taught in social fields and the inability to understand different points of view. Education in history is essentially a nation‚Äôs propaganda; the nation is always right and just. Such education would cause the students unable to think critically of the nation‚Äôs affairs. Biddle said that community agencies require cooperation in guiding youth to accomplish more effective occupational adjustments. Biddle argues that schools fail to carry out successful educational function without being greatly concerned of student‚Äôs vocational possibilities. He also believes that employment services can not be effective without consistent interaction with schools for receiving pertinent information accumulated of youth. Fixing education Biddle believed that one way to fix autistic thinking in education is to expose children to others with opposing views and to teach them to have respect for them. Experiences of this nature will allow them to have critical thinking and be capable of having a rational opinion while in a debate with those with opposing opinions. Biddle gives general education two definitions: a traditional definition and a functional definition. It is traditionally defined as a frame of cultural subject-matter that is required for students to attain in order to be educated. He defines it functionally as a course of action, and various experiences, by which students rely on as a way of living. Biddle argues that these definitions seem sterile and unreal to many students. He criticizes that such absorption of culture overlooks the central theme of western civilization, moral, and religious values that are critical in giving it meaning and direction. It also functionally gives a vocational emphasis which is conceived as merely an occupational skill and thus students graduate with a lack of background, sense of direction, and as an uncultured artisan. Biddle states that the purpose of general education is to close the gap between adolescence and adulthood and this can be accomplished by the students exploration of his own habits, potentialities, and familiarity with the community and social order.  Death and legacy  Biddle died at the age of seventy two in Columbia Missouri. He was survived by his son, Bruce, who was the chairmen of the Department of Social Psychology at the University of Missouri. After Biddle‚Äôs death, a memorial fund was made in his honor at the University of Missouri where he presented his personal books and paper to the library. Biddle continued to be a spokesmen for community development throughout his writings. In recognition of his books and writing in the field of community development, The Community Development Process has been translated into quite a few languages for universities around the world to access.

Typically, this loop is designed to create a neurochemical reward in the user such as the release of dopamine. Compulsion loops are deliberately used in video game design as an extrinsic motivation for players, but may also result from other activities that create such loops, intentionally or not, such as gambling addiction and Internet addiction disorder. Basis The understanding of the motivations of compulsion loops came out of experiments performed on laboratory animals in operant conditioning chamber or a \\"Skinner box\\", where the animals are given both positive and negative stimuli for performing certain actions, such as providing food by pressing a lever. Besides demonstrating that animals would prefer positive rewards and thus learned to trigger the correct lever, B. F. Skinner found that the effects of random rewards and variable time between awards also became a factor towards how quickly the animals learned the rules of the positive reinforcement system. Ongoing research has shown that dopamine, synthesized in the animal brain, is a key neurotransmitter involved in this process; disabling the ability for receptors to react to dopamine in animal studies can impact how rapidly the animals can be conditioned. Applying these principles to gaming, a compulsion loop creates a three-part cycle: the anticipation of receiving some reward, the activity that must be completed to receive that reward, and the act of finally obtaining the reward. From a neuroscience aspect, it is believed that the anticipation phase is where dopamine is created by the human brain, while it is released upon obtaining the reward. Dopamine creates feelings of pleasure in the brain and drives motivation, and while the neurotransmitter itself is not addictive, can lead to addictive behavior as the user desires to experience the further dopamine release. In game design A core or compulsion loop is any repetitive gameplay cycle that is designed to keep the player engaged with the game. Players perform an action, are rewarded, another possibility opens and the cycle repeats.Keith Stuart: My favourite waste of time: why Candy Crush and Angry Birds are so compulsive, The Guardian, 21 May 2014 A compulsion loop may be distinguished further from a core loop; while many games have a core loop of activities that a player may repeat over and over again, such as combat within a role-playing game, a compulsion loop is particularly designed to guide the player into anticipation for the potential reward from specific activities. The compulsion loop can be strengthened by adding a variable ratio schedule, where each response has a chance of producing a reward. Another strategy is an avoidance schedule, where the players work to postpone a negative consequence. Without a lack of meaningful reward, the player may eventually no longer engage with the game, causing extinction of the player population for a game. Particularly for freemium titles, where players can opt to spend real-world money for in-game boosts, extinction is undesirable so the game is designed around a near-perpetual compulsion loop alongside frequent addition of new content. Compulsion loops in video games can be established through several means. One common approach is to show the player a \\"baseline\\" for how powerful the player-character could become, such as starting the game in an advanced power state and shortly stripping the character of those advancements and having the player rebuild the character to that state, or to show them a powerful non-player character that their starting character could eventually build towards. Another approach is through the difficulty curve of the game, making enemies stronger as the player-characters advances deeper into the game, and requiring the player to spent time to improve the character whether through new gear, abilities, or the player's own performance to progress. In multiplayer games, players may also be simply driven by envy towards other players that have more powerful characters. Some loops can rely on the concept of withdrawal, in that the player may get to a state in the game they are content with, but by some means, the game shows the player a potential of where they could be by improving, and anticipating the player to feel like they are lacking something and will return to engage in the game. A well-known example of a compulsion loop in video games is the Monster Hunter series by Capcom. Players take the role of a monster hunter, using a variety of weapons and armor to slay or trap the creatures. By doing so, they gain monster parts and other loot that can be used to craft new weapons and equipment that is typically stronger than their previous gear. The loop presents itself that players use their current equipment to hunt monsters with a given difficulty level that provide parts that can be used to craft improved equipment. This then lets them face more difficult monsters that provide parts for even better gear. This is aided by the random nature of the drops (a variable ratio), sometimes requiring players to repeat quests several times to get the right parts. Another type of compulsion loop are offered through many games in the form of a loot box or similar term, depending on the game. Loot boxes are earned progressively by continuing to play the game; this may be as a reward for winning a match, purchasable through in-game currency that one earns in game, or through microtransactions with real-world funds. Loot boxes contain a fixed number of randomly chosen in-game items, with at least one guaranteed to be of a higher rarity than the others. For many games, these items are simply customization options for the player's avatar that has no direct impact on gameplay, but they may also include gameplay-related items, or additional in-game currency. Loot boxes work under the psychology principle of variable rate reinforcement, which causes dopamine production at higher rates due to the unpredictable nature of the reward in contrast to fixed rewards. In many games, opening a loot box is accompanied by visuals and audios to heighten the excitement and further this response. Overall, a loot box system can encourage the player to continue to play the game, and potentially spend real-world funds to gain loot boxes immediately. Controversy arose in 2018 around loot boxes with several experts, governments, and concerns citizens fearing that loot boxes could lead to gambling, particularly in youth, and some governments took step to ban loot box practices that involved real-world funds. Compulsion loops can be used as a replacement for game content, especially in grinding and freemium game experience models. The opposite of rewarding predictable, tedious and repetitive tasks are reward action contingency based systems, where players overcome game challenges with clear signals of progress. Psychological effects Encouraging players to return to the game world can lead to video game addiction.Mez Breeze: A quiet killer: Why video games are so addictive, TNW, Jan 12, 2013 Internet addiction disorder can also result from a compulsion loop created by users in checking email, websites, and social media to see the results of their actions. A further concern related to compulsion loops in video games is a potential for violent video games to lead to violent behavior. While the American Psychological Association (APA) had asserted in 2019 that there is no direct connection between violent video games and real-world violent behavior, some still fear that compulsion loops in these types of games can help to reinforce violence tendencies.

Rescuers searching through debris for survivors of the Mocoa landslide From December 2016 and continuing until May 2017, much of western and central South America was plagued by persistent heavy rain events. In Peru, one of the most severely impacted nations, it has been referred to as the 2017 Coastal Ni√±o (Spanish: El Ni√±o costero de 2017). The flooding was preceded by drought-like conditions throughout the region for much of 2016 and a strong warming of sea temperatures off the coast of Peru. Background From 2014 to 2016, the Pacific Ocean experienced a significant El Ni√±o event. By June 2016, the El Ni√±o had subsided but lingering drought-like conditions persisted through the southern spring in late 2016. Starting in November 2016, a localized anomalous warming of the Pacific occurred which is known locally as the Coastal Ni√±o. A Coastal Ni√±o is differentiated from an El Ni√±o event in that the Coastal Ni√±o is localized to the coasts of Ecuador and Peru and does not expand into the equatorial central Pacific Ocean or impact global temperatures. This ocean warming contributed to unseasonably high rainfall in the region and, by January 2017, Peruvian officials had declared the warming a Coastal Ni√±o occurrence. Impacts =Colombia= On December 1, 2016, heavy rains in Cali triggered a landslide that claimed at least six lives. All the fatalities took place in the Siloe neighborhood where 14 homes were destroyed. During the overnight of March 31 ‚Äì April 1, heavy rain affected parts of the Putumayo Department. A total of of rain fell within a few hours near the city of Mocoa. This caused the Mocoa, Sangoyaco, and Mulata rivers to overflow and send mudflows towards residences and infrastructure in the city of Mocoa by 3:00 a.m. Multiple neighborhoods were devastated in the disaster, with numerous residents caught off-guard. By the morning of 6 April, at least 301 people were known dead (including 92 children), more than 400 were injured (including 167 children), and a further 314 were missing. =Ecuador= In Ecuador, at least 16 people were killed by floods or landslides. Coastal Manab√≠ declared a state emergency and the country's largest city, Guayaquil in Guayas experienced abnormally high rain events. Higher elevation regions including Quito experienced severe rains, landslides, and sinkholes towards the tail end of the Coastal Ni√±o event as the ITCZ began moving north towards its more usual latitude. =Peru= Much of the coastal desert region of Peru was particularly hard-hit with incessant, heavy rains starting in January 2017\\\\. Most impacted were the regions of Tumbes, Piura, and Lambayeque where a state of emergency was declared on February 3, 2017. These equatorial parts of Peru are typically dry throughout the summer but can be greatly impacted by climactic changes when adjacent ocean warms and the equatorial trough oscillates further south. During these occurrences, monsoon-like rains can fall in usually bone-dry ecosystems causing mudslides locally known as huaycos. The 2017 Coastal Ni√±o was the worst to hit Peru since 1925. More than 115,000 homes were demolished, leaving approximately 178,000 people homeless. A total of 113 people were killed, 354 were injured, and a further 18 were missing. More than 2,500 kilometers (1,500 miles) of roads were destroyed and an estimated 1.1 million people have been directly affected by the floods. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs noted that 3 million people were at-risk for waterborne diseases. On March 16, a mudflow buried the village of Barbablanca; however, all 160 residents escaped. On March 27, 2017, the Piura River broke its banks and flooded the city of Piura and the towns of Catacaos and Pedregal Chico. In Piura, of rain fell in one day, three times the city's annual average and Catacaos had flood waters rise to high. Further south, La Libertad, √Åncash, and Lima were also impacted. Trujillo experienced severe localized flooding in its ravines and Huarmey was badly flooded. =Elsewhere= In Brazil, Heavy rains on March 11‚Äì13, 2017, including in 24 hours, caused flooding across Rio Grande do Sul, killing 2 people, injuring 70, and leaving 10 others missing. Further south, in Chile, unusually heavy rains affected areas around Santiago starting in February 2017. Flooding and landslides killed at least eighteen people and left few others missing.

The division was assigned to the southern sector of the Soviet-German front during the winter counteroffensive, but took severe losses during the German spring offensive that formed the Izium Pocket, and it was all but destroyed in the opening phase of Case Blue. The division was formed again nearly two years later, this time in the Far Eastern Front, and spent the rest of the war mainly on coastal defense duties.

In October, while still barely formed, the division was assigned to 57th Army, which was also just in the process of forming-up in the Reserve of the Supreme High Command. In December the division and its Army moved to join Southwestern Front, taking part in the Barvenkovo‚ÄìLozovaya Offensive which led to the creation of the Izium salient south of Kharkov. On December 10, Colonel Fofanov was succeeded by Lt. Col. Pavel Mikhailovich Volosatykh. On February 9, 1942, this officer was relieved of his command and replaced by Col. Ivan Afanasevich Shevchenko, who would remain in command for the rest of the first formation. Ten days later, Volosatykh was condemned to eight years front-line duty and was moved to command of 674th Rifle Regiment of the 150th Rifle Division; despite this disgrace he would eventually be promoted to Major General and would become a Hero of the Soviet Union. In April, the 335th was transferred to 9th Army in Southern Front, on the southern flank of the salient.David M.

The 335th was holding a sector to the southeast of Barvenkovo, with a strength of between 5,000 and 6,000 men. The German offensive did not target the division directly, but smashed in the front lines on both flanks, so by day's end on the 17th the division was partly encircled, along with 106th and 349th Rifle Divisions. The next day the beleaguered divisions were able to link up with the remaining units of 5th Cavalry Corps, but a change in direction of the enemy advance cut them off from the crossings to the left bank of the northern Donets River, where 9th Army was trying to reorganize. On May 19, By May 22, the remnants of the 335th was holding the line along the Donets west of Izium; despite its losses, it avoided the fate of the 6th and 57th Armies which were pocketed the same day.Glantz, Kharkov, pp. 227, 231, 238-39, 255-57, 263, 282, 309 =Operation Blue= When 1st Panzer and 17th Army launched the German summer offensive on their sectors on July 7, the 335th was still in Southern Front, but now in 24th Army. This newly-formed army, with just four damaged rifle divisions, was attempting to provide a second echelon for the Front. On July 10 the Front was ordered to form those divisions into a task force along with a special tank group to move northeastward to block the XXXX Panzer Corps in the Chertkovo area. This move availed very little, and led to a good many men of the 335th being killed or captured in the Millerovo pocket.David M. Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, pp. 112, 177-78, 182, 539 By August 1 the division was officially in 24th Army in North Caucasus Front listed as \\"without troops\\".

The OoB of this formation was likely different from the 1st Formation, because many late-war divisions used lower regimental numbers made available by the conversion of rifle divisions into Guards units in 1942-43. Col. Ivan Ivanovich Malinovskii was appointed to command on the same day, which he would hold for the duration. This division was assigned to the 88th Rifle Corps, a separate corps stationed on the Pacific coast near Vladivostok. During the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August, 1945, the 335th was in 1st Far Eastern Front as part of the Chuguevsk Operational Group, a covering force which saw little major combat or offensive action.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 125 Postwar The 335th ended the war without any battle honors or unit decorations.

Kunst was born in 1941 in Miami Beach, Florida. He supported the 1976 Miami-Dade County Ordinance for Gay Rights and was later involved in activism for people with AIDS. Kunst opposed Save Our Children, a Dade County, Florida voter- approved county initiative supported by singer Anita Bryant and her then- husband Bob Green. The initiative repealed the previous anti-discrimination ordinance Kunst had supported. The law was eventually repealed by the state Supreme Court of Florida in 2010. In 1991, after allegations of financial mismanagement were published in the Miami Herald, Kunst was fired as the executive director of Cure AIDS Now. As a Democratic Party politician, Kunst unsuccessfully campaigned in the Democratic primary against Bob Graham in the 1986 United States Senate elections in Florida. Kunst also ran unsuccessfully in the 2010 United States House of Representatives Election, this time as an unaffiliated independent, against incumbent Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, in Florida. Kunst volunteered for the Hillary Rodham Clinton 2008 U.S. presidential campaign in Florida. Kunst was president (1991-2001) of Shalom International, a Jewish group combating global Neo- Nazism and Neo-fascism movements. And he was a co-founder of the Oral Majority in 1982, the liberal and secular counter-protest group of the Religious Right organizations Moral Majority and later the Christian Coalition. In 2018, Kunst protested outside the courthouse where Noor Salman, Omar Mateen's widow, was being tried for complicity in her husband's Pulse nightclub massacre with a sign reading \\"'Fry her till she has no 'Pulse'\\". Noor Salman was found not guilty during a trial that also exposed the fact that she was abused by her husband. Kunst worked in marketing for the Miami Toros professional soccer team in the 1970s.

A 1980s paleoseismic study that included a trench investigation and mapping revealed that a major earthquake had most likely not occurred to the east of the San Fernando rupture area for at least the last several thousand, and possibly the last 11,000 years. The 1971 event was the first in a series (1987 Whittier Narrows, 1991 Sierra Madre, 1994 Northridge) of damaging earthquakes which have occurred on reverse faults in the Los Angeles area. The events triggered discussions concerning the largest magnitude earthquake that could be generated by one of the faults, especially in the Transverse Ranges, but the focal point of earthquake hazard assessments in California are often the San Andreas Fault and other associated dextral faults. Although there is a lack of paleoseismic data on reverse faults in the Los Angeles area, a trench excavation at a site on the Sierra Madre-Cucamonga Fault revealed that two large historic earthquakes occurred in the last 15,000 years. The central Transverse Ranges The fault was studied again in the late 1990s in the Loma Alta Park near Millard Canyon where a fault scarp larger than was accessible along a (late quaternary) elevated stream terrace. The clearly defined fault was exposed in the trench and emerged as a band of coarse gravels lining the hanging wall. By studying the truncated rocks and a wedge-shaped accumulation of gravel and soil, it was possible to visually reconstruct the original geometry of the rock prior to the thrust and eventual and partial collapse of the hanging wall back onto the footwall. An estimate for the maximum slip of the event was given as . The evidence found at the Loma Alta trench investigation site brought new information into the deliberation regarding the maximum size of earthquakes near Los Angeles. The large amount of slip observed there did not correspond with a short rupture length of the Sierra Madre Fault Zone, and instead suggested that the historical thrust earthquakes were much larger in magnitude than what was seen with the 1971 event, given its smaller of maximum observed displacement. Two methods were employed to infer the scope of the events at the site (one regression-based and the other based on the seismic moment) and produced a maximum magnitude of 7.5 or 7.6 for the most recent movement of the fault. The results supported an earlier hypothesis that seismic energy release on the Sierra Madre Fault Zone is characterized by infrequent but large earthquakes. A duplicate event in modern times would rupture to the south towards populated areas and would produce strong ground motion capable of damaging modern buildings and other critical infrastructure.

He specializes in systematic theology, historical theology, and the history of Christian spirituality, engaging especially with Christian mysticism. Since 2014, he has been Professor of Christian Spirituality at Loyola University Chicago. He was previously, from 2009 to 2014, the Van Mildert Professor of Divinity at Durham University and a Canon Residentiary of Durham Cathedral. Early life and education McIntosh was born on 2 February 1960 in Evanston, Illinois, United States. He studied history at Yale University, writing his senior thesis under the supervision of the Christian historian Jaroslav Pelikan, and graduating magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1982. He then moved to England where he trained for holy orders at St Stephen's House, Oxford, an Anglo-Catholic theological college, and studied theology at the University of Oxford. He graduated with a further BA degree in theology 1985. He then returned to the United States to study at the General Theological Seminary, a seminary of the Episcopal Church in New York City; he completed a Master of Divinity (MDiv) degree in 1986. Studying with several experts in systematic and mystical theology, including Bernard McGinn, he completed his PhD in 1993 at the University of Chicago, where he focused on the mystical aspects of Hans Urs von Balthasar's Christology. Career In December 1986, McIntosh was ordained in the Episcopal Church (United States) as a priest by Frank T. Griswold for the Diocese of Chicago. From 1986 to 1989, he served as an assistant to the Dean of St James Cathedral, Chicago, Illinois, and from 2003 to 2006, served as canon theologian to Frank T. Griswold during his tenure as 25th Presiding Bishop and Primate of the Episcopal Church. = Theology = McIntosh has become well known in the sphere of systematic theology, and especially on Christian mysticism. Looking at the works of Balthasar or Bonaventure, C. S. Lewis or Maximus the Confessor, McIntosh provides in his publications a study of many great theologians in order to reveal the underlying ideas, and adding to them with original and masterful thought. Drawing on themes that begin with the pre- Christian thinkers Plato and Plotinus, McIntosh threads together the mystical, philosophical, and epistemological traditions of centuries of Christian thought, assembling an impressive corpus of new interpretations as well as his own theological contributions. In recent years, he has been teaching and researching for projects involving the Divine Ideas, or exemplar forms ‚Äì their relatively unrecognized but crucial place in Christian theology.

It is a cast- iron building in the Italianate architecture style, built in 1869‚Äì70 and designed by D. & J. Jardine. It is the lone survivor of a pair of buildings at 317 and 319 which were known as the \\"Thomas Twins\\". The cast iron for these mirror-twin buildings was provided by Daniel D. Badger's Architectural Iron Works. The building was designated a New York City landmark on August 29, 1989.NYCLPC, p.34 History The site of 319 Broadway, at the northwest corner of Thomas Street and Broadway, was previously owned by the New York Hospital, which sat adjacent to the property. In 1869, the Union Army general and real-estate developer Thomas Alfred Davies leased two lots flanking Thomas Street from the Society of New York Hospital, commissioning the firm of D. & J. Jardine to design a cast-iron building for each lot. The two buildings faced each other until 1971, when 317 Broadway was torn down. Early tenants of 319 Broadway included the Security State Bank and the Metropolitan Life Insurance Corporation. Above the first story, 319 Broadway remains similar to the way it looked at the time of its construction. The stoop was removed in 1912, along with sidewalk encumbrances. Around that time, the basement level was designated as the first story, which classified the building as a five- story structure. The building continues to house offices and a restaurant. Description The Italianate-style building extends along Broadway and along Thomas Street. Faced in cast iron, the building contains many original two- over-two wood sash windows. The Broadway elevation originally contained a stoop at the north and two openings with flattened arches and a corner pier. This pattern was continued on the Thomas Street elevation. Plate glass windows have replaced the flat-arched openings on Broadway, and the first story of the Thomas Street elevation has been largely enclosed by a building addition, although the arched openings are still present. On Broadway, the second through fifth floors have one bay containing three window openings. The north opening of the second floor contains a slightly projecting portico with flanking engaged columns supporting a triangular pediment and brackets with incised neo-Grec ornament, which is likely a later replacement. This opening contains a single-pane window with a decorative metal fanlight above. All of the windows are arched and capped by a scrolled keystone and flanked by Corinthian columns. A pilaster marks the south corner. Stories three through five contain three window openings each, gradually decreasing in size, flanked by Corinthian columns and terminated by piers at each end supporting a cornice. The center window on the fourth floor contains paired glass doors installed in recent years, leading to a fire escape containing wrought-iron filigree extending from the second story to the fifth. The roof is surmounted by a projecting cornice containing dentils and scrolled brackets. The Thomas Street elevation is similar to that on Broadway. It has three bays; the outer two containing five window openings per story and the center bay with four, each bay separated by Corinthian piers. With the exception of the two western openings and the eastern opening, articulated by flattened arches, the first floor has been enlarged since the building's construction. At the base of the service entrance, a metal plaque reads \\"Architectural Iron Works / 14th Street between / A B & C NY.\\" Above the service entrance, each window contains an arched transom with paired wood sash windows. The rear wall, adjacent to the Thomas Street elevation, is covered with gray stucco.

Video game preservation is a form of preservation applied to the video game industry that includes, but is not limited to digital preservation. Such preservation efforts include archiving development source code and art assets, digital copies of video games, emulation of video game hardware, maintenance and preservation of specialized video game hardware such as arcade games and video game consoles, and digitization of print video game magazines and books prior to the Digital Revolution. Importance of preservation Unlike most other forms of media like books, art and photography, and film which can be preserved in a variety of formats that are not ladened with intellectual property (IP) issue, video games typically require specialized and/or proprietary computer hardware and software to read and execute game software. However, as technology advances, these older game systems become obsolete, no longer produced nor maintained to use for executing games. The media formats of the early days of computer gaming, relying on floppy discs and CD-ROMs, suffers from disc rot and degrade over time, making it difficult to recover information. Further, video games tend to rely on other resources like operating systems, network connectivity, and external servers outside control of users, and making sure these boundary aspects to a video game are preserved along with the game are also essential. One period of the video game industry that has received a great deal of attention is up through the 1980s. As a result of the video game crash of 1983, many companies involved in developing games folded or were acquired by other companies. In this process, the source code for many games prior to the crash were lost or destroyed, leaving only previously-sold copies of games on their original format as evidence of their existence. Preservation has become a greater priority for game companies since the 2000s with the ease of redundant digital storage solutions, and thus tend not to be an issue for games issued since that point. Frank Cifaldi said that Electronic Arts had developed an extensive means of preserving their games at the end of the development cycle as well as contact former employees to collect data and assets from past games to help preserve their titles. Legal issues Most issues related to video game preservation are based on the United States, one of the largest markets for video games, and as such, issues related to preservation are limited by laws of the country. In general, the copying and distribution of video games that are under copyright without authorization is considered a copyright violation (often called as software piracy). However, it has generally been allowed that users may make archival copies of software (including video games) as long as they own the original software; if the user sells or give away the original software, they must destroy the archival copies. This is also justification for a person being able to make ROM images from game cartridges that they own. In 1998, the United Congress passed the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), designed to bring copyright within the United States to align with two doctrines published by the World Intellectual Property Organization in 1996. The DMCA make it a criminal offense to develop, sell, or use technologies that are designed to bypass digital rights management (DRM) used in various forms of media. This subsequently made it illegal to backup up one's software for many games distributed via either game cartridge or optical disc, if some form of DRM was used to limit access to the software on the media. The Library of Congress is responsible to open submissions for specific and narrow exemptions from interested parties every three years, and determine which of those, if any, to grant. Through the Library of Congress, some key exceptions to the DMCA have been granted to allow for video game preservation. * In the 2003 set of exemptions, the Library disallowed enforcement of the DMCA for \\"computer programs protected by dongles that prevent access due to malfunction or damage and which are obsolete\\" and for \\"computer programs and video games distributed in formats that have become obsolete and which require the original media or hardware as a condition of access\\". * In the 2015 exemptions, the Library granted permission for preservationists to work around copy-protection in games which required an authentication step with an external server that was no longer online prior to playing the game which otherwise did not require online connectivity; this specifically did not cover games that were based on a server-client mode like most massively-multiplayer online games (MMOs). * In the 2018 exemptions, the Library allowed for preservation and fair use of server-based games like MMOs, permitting preservationists to offer such games where they have legally obtained the game's code within museums and libraries. The DMCA exemptions do not mean all ROM images are legal, and concern about continuing video game preservation was raised in mid-2018, after Nintendo initiated a lawsuit against two websites that distributed ROMs for games from their older platforms. Normal copyright laws and contractual agreements may also hamper legitimate preservation efforts. The game The Operative: No One Lives Forever and its sequel is considered to be copyright limbo due to subsequent business moves that dispersed where the IP may have gone: the game was developed by Monolith Studios which after publication became a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. It had been published by Sierra Entertainment, which had been owned by Fox Interactive, a subsidiary of 20th Century Fox, but later sold to Vivendi Games; Vivendi Games itself eventually was merged into Activision Blizzard. Night Dive Studios, a company with interest in reviving old games, had spent significant time working between Warner Bros., Fox, and Activision to try to track down the ownership of the game's IP but none of the three companies had immediate knowledge of the IP's state, and did not see the value in searching their paper archives to find the required documents, particularly if became a case of jointly-owned IP. Preservation of video game software =Emulation= Video game console emulators use software that replicates the hardware of a video game console or arcade machine. Generally these create a virtual machine on newer computer systems that simulate the key processing units of the original hardware. The emulators then can read in software, such as a ROM image for arcade games or cartridge-based systems, or the game's optical media disc or an ISO image of that disc, to play the game in full. Emulation has been used in some official capacity on newer consoles. Nintendo's Virtual Console allows games from its earlier consoles and other third-parties to be played on its newer ones. Sony had originally released the PlayStation 3 with backwards compatibility with PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 games if players had the original media, but have transitioned to selling emulated games in its PlayStation Store as well as offering the PlayStation Now cloud gaming service that allows PlayStation 3 games to be played on other devices including the PlayStation 4 and compatible personal computers. Microsoft has created a backwards compatibility program through emulation to allow selected Xbox 360 titles to be played on the Xbox One if they own the original game and have made some of these titles available for purchase through Xbox Live. Former console hardware companies such as Sega and Atari have released emulation-based collections of their games for multiple systems. In the PC space, emulation of either a game engine or full operating system are available. In these cases, players are expected to own copies of the game to use the content files. DOSBox emulates a complete IBM PC compatible operating system allowing most games for older computers to be run on modern systems. Emulators also exist for older arcade games, such as MAME. There are legalities related to emulation that can make it difficult to preserve video games in this manner. First, the legality of creating an emulator itself is unclear. Several United States case laws have shown that developing emulation is a legal activity as long as no proprietary information or copyrighted code is incorporated into the emulation. =Datting= Databases (often referred to as \\"dats\\") created by video game \\"datting\\" groups that store hashes and other important metadata provide a quality assurance aspect by comparing different contributors' dump results. Redump.org stores the hash and metadata information for over 70,000 video game disc dumps. No- Intro.org stores the metadata and hashes over 200,000 items for cartridge and DLC based games and content. These systems act as a card catalog to track game releases across various regions, comparing software revisions and other data such as serial numbers and barcodes. Additional databases, both functional and defunct include TOSEC and trurip. =Migration= Migration refers to re- releasing software from one platform to a newer platform, otherwise keeping all the gameplay, narrative, and art assets the same. This can be done through a few routes: * Game engine recreation: A new universal game engine can be developed that uses the original game assets but otherwise runs on any future hardware platform. Such examples include the Z-machine for many of the Infocom text adventure games, and the ScummVM allows players to run nearly every LucasArts adventure game. * Software re-compilation or porting: The original source code for the game is re-compiled for a newer platform, making necessary changes to work on the newer hardware. This requires that the source code for the original game is available for this purpose. Many of the games published by Digital Eclipse are based on decompiling of the original game's code with approval of the copyright owner into their own Eclipse engine which allows for porting to any number of systems. =Abandonware= Abandonware refers to software that may still be capable of running on modern computers or consoles, but the developer or publisher has either disappeared, no longer sell the product, or no longer operate servers necessary for running the software, among other cases. Legally, such software still falls under normal copyright laws; copyright only disappears over time depending on its copyright term (from 75 to 90 years for most video games), and even with shuttered companies, the copyright is an asset that often becomes owned by the liquidator of the closed company. Under the DMCA, the Copyright Office has made exceptions since 2015 for allowing museums and other archivists to bypass copyright issues to get such software into a playable state, a new exception seeks to allow this specifically for multiplayer games requiring servers, specifically massively- multiplayer online games. =Fan-driven efforts= In some cases, fans of a video game have helped to preserve the game to the best of their abilities without access to source code, even through the copyright nature of these fan projects are highly contentious, and more so when monetary issues are involved. Games like Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II and Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines, which had difficult production issues before release, may leave unused assets to be found by players, and in the case of both these games, players have developed unofficial patches that work to complete the content, in some cases, exceeding expectations of the original content creators. =Others= Source code for older games, before rights were strongly controlled by publishers, were often kept by the programmers themselves, and they may release those, or may be part of their estate after death. In one case, a lost Nintendo Entertainment System game, an earlier version of Days of Thunder by Chris Oberth, who had died in 2012, was recovered from source code on floppy discs from his work materials in 2020 by the Video Game History Foundation with permission of his family. Preservation of video game software has come through dubious routes. Notably, the source code for all of the Infocom text adventure games had been obtained by Jason Scott in 2008 via an anonymous user in the \\"Infocom drive\\", an archive file that represented the entirety of the Infocom's main server days prior to the company's relocation from Massachusetts to California in 1989. While Scott was aware this was akin to industrial espionage, he still had published the source code for the games for purposes of preservation. John Hardie of the National Videogame Museum had gone dumpster diving through the trash of shutdown companies to recover materials for his collection. Preservation of video game hardware The only known existing hardware unit of the Super NES CD-ROM - a Sony-produced Super Nintendo Entertain System with a CD-ROM system and the predecessor of the PlayStation While in most cases, digitizing the software for video games is sufficient for preservation, there have been enough unique consoles with limited production runs that can create further challenges for video game preservation as it is difficult to emulate its software. When hardware is in ready supply, white-hat hackers and programmers can freely tear-down these systems to analyze their internals for reverse engineering for preservation, but when systems are in limited supply, such tactics are not appropriate. These systems can also degrade as well. More often, broken or non-functional versions of older hardware can be acquired to demonstrate that such systems existed, but fail to work as a software preservation tool. For example, only one copy of the Super NES CD-ROM, a Sony-produced Super Nintendo Entertainment System with a CD-ROM drive, has been found out of an estimated 200 that were produced before Sony and Nintendo's deal changed. The unit was carefully repaired to be able to use the CD-ROM so that some functionality of its software could be verified and allow the few known software titles to be tested on it. Print media preservation Box art and game manuals accompanied most games published before 2000, and there had been an extensive number of magazines published on video games which have since declined. There is a strong interested in the digital preservation of these materials alongside software and hardware as reference material to help document the early history of video games, which did not received the type of detailed coverage that the field sees as of the 2010s. In most cases, these works are preserved through digital scanning and storage from libraries and user collections. Preservation efforts =Library of Congress= The United States Library of Congress (LoC) launched the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program (NDIIPP) in 2000 to preserve non- traditional media. Around 2007, the LoC started reaching out to partners in various industries to help explore how they archive such content. The LoC had funded the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign (UIUC) from 2004 to 2010 to develop the ECHO DEPository (\\"Exploring Collaborations to Harvest Objects in a Digital Environment for Preservation\\") program.  Preserving Virtual Worlds  Preserving Virtual Worlds was one project funded by the LoC and conducted by the Rochester Institute of Technology, Stanford University, the University of Maryland, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, along with support from Linden Lab, running from 2008 to 2010. The study explored a range of games, from Spacewar! (1962) through Second Life (2003, which was developed by Linden Labs), to determine what methods could be used for preserving this titles. The project concluded while there are technical solutions for preservation of game software, such as identify common formats for digital storage and developing database architectures to track ownership, many issues related to preservation remain legal in nature relating to copyright laws. =National Film and Sound Archive= The National Film and Sound Archive of Australia announced in September 2019 that they will start created an archive of Australian-developed video games for preservation and exhibition, with games to be added on an annual basis. The preservation effort will include not only the software but art, music and other creative assets as well as making considerations for playability in the long-term. =Internet Archive= The Internet Archive started adding emulation of video games from older systems for play. The Archive developed Emularity, a web-browser based emulator to run a number of out-of-production arcade, console and computer emulations, and offer numerous titles to be played through the Archive. The project's maintainer, Jason Scott, said that most companies do not take issue with their ROM images being offered in this manner, but did note that Nintendo has put pressure on them to not include any Nintendo consoles within the collection. =Video Game History Foundation= Frank Cifaldi is one of the leading historians in the video game industry trying to encourage more video game preservation and to help recover games once thought lost. By 2017, he had spent about twenty years trying to encourage preservation as to track video game history, and established the non-profit Video Game History Foundation in 2017. The Foundation not only seeks to preserve games, but box art, manuals, and promotional material from video games, believing that these combined can help future historians understand the culture of games in the past. =National Videogame Museum= The National Videogame Museum in the United States bore out of archival work performed by John Hardie who had run the Classic Gaming Expo. During this time Hardie had collected a number of video game materials from others and his own efforts. The collection of material collected drew interest from industry events including E3 and the Game Developers Conference, helping to promote the collection. Hardie exhibited the materials through traveling shows, and got interest from Randy Pitchford to establish a permanent home for the collection. The Museum was opened in Frisco, Texas in 2016. While some companies have donated materials to the Museum, Hardie stated it has been difficult in convincing other developers and publishers to contribute to the preservation efforts. =Centre for Computing History= The Centre for Computing History's ongoing efforts have resulted in the physical preservation of over 12,000 video games since 2008. Information for every item in the collection is accessible via their online catalogue. The Centre also digitally archives source code for games such as the Magic Knight series by David Jones (programmer), and preserves and hosts scans of original sketches and other development materials from game companies such as Guerrilla Games. Their work emphasises the importance of preserving all aspects of the experience of a game, from marketing materials to the copy protection experience, packaging, and hardware. The Centre's collection also hosts uncommon hardware and operating systems with this in mind. The Centre is also working with current video game developers and publishers, acting as a repository for their ongoing work so that it is actively preserved. =The Strong Institute= Among other educational aspects The Strong institute in Rochester, New York operates the International Center for the History of Electronic Games. =Videogame Heritage Society= The Videogame Heritage Society is an effort started by the United Kingdom's National Videogame Museum along with the British Library, the Museum of London, the Centre for Computing History, the National Science and Media Museum in Bradford, Bath Spa University, and several independent collectors in 2020 to preserve video games developed in the United Kingdom. = Game Preservation Society = Founded in 2011 in Tokyo, the Game Preservation Society preserves the history of Japanese video games. The organization's focus is the preservation of 1980s Japanese computer games for platforms like the PC-88 and Sharp X1. The society's president, French national Joseph Redon, estimates that they will only be able to preserve about 80% of Japanese computer games. = National Software Reference Library = While strictly not set up for preservation, the National Software Reference Library, created and maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has included a number of popular game software among other software principally used for help in digital forensics, storing electronic copies of these games and other programs. The initial games collection was added in 2016 with numerous titles collected by Stephen Cabrinety, who had died in 1995; in 2018, Valve, Activision-Blizzard, and Electronic Arts all donated additional titles to be added to the collection, while NIST itself purchased other popular titles to include. =Hong Kong Game Association (RETRO.HK)= Founded in 2015 in Hong Kong by Dixon Wu and other volunteers with decades of video game knowledge, the Hong Kong Game Association is a non-profit society dedicated to preserve, curate, and showcase video game history, especially focusing on locally developed PC & console games, and traditional Chinese video game literature. The Association organizes the annual RETRO.HK Gaming Expo and RetroCup - free annual retro game events that are dedicated to promoting video game and competitive gaming as a culture and art form to the public. The association has worked with multiple local universities or colleges to promote the cause, such as The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, The City University of Hong Kong, The Open University of Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education (IVE) group. =The Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment= Founded in 2011 in Oakland, California the Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment, the MADE performed the first institutional preservation of an online game when it worked with F. Randall Farmer, Chip Morningstar, Fujitsu, and a group of volunteers to relaunch LucasFilm Games Habitat (video game) . This work lead to collaboration with UC Berkeley to petition for a 1201 DMCA exemption for the preservation of MMO games . The source code to Habitat has since been release as open source software under the MIT license . The MADE continues to work on further digital preservation, focusing on source code and online games. =Flashpoint= The Adobe Flash standard, heavily used in browser- based video games in the 2000s, is scheduled to be fully removed from most web browsers by the end of 2020 due to long-running security issues with the Flash format, and will make these games unplayable. An effort called Flashpoint was established in 2018 to collect as many of the freely-available Flash games as possible for archival purposes, excluding those games that were offered commercially or that require a server to play, and allowing authors to request removal. As of January 2020, the Flashpoint project has more than 38,000 Flash games in its archive. =Rereleases= Companies like GOG.com and Night Dive Studios are recognized for helping to migrate older games to modern systems. Among their efforts include doing the research to track down all legal rights that are associated with a game, including those that have changed hands several times, as to get clearance or rights to republish the title, locate as much of the game's original source code and adapt that to work on modern systems, or when source code is not available, reverse engine the game to either work natively or through emulation (like DOSBox) with modern hardware. GOG.com and Night Dive have successfully freed some games from IP limbo, such as System Shock 2, while identifying titles that remain difficult to republish and preserve legally due to conflicts on IP rights holders, such as No One Lives Forever.

It is a ground orchid with a single, hairy leaf and usually only one greenish-cream flower with red markings. Description Caladenia stellata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber. It has a single, dull green, hairy, linear leaf, 60‚Äì150 mm long and 5‚Äì10 mm wide with reddish-purple blotches near its base. Usually only one flower about 40 mm across is borne on a spike 120‚Äì300 mm tall. The flowers are greenish cream and the sepals have thick, dark red, club-like glandular tips 5‚Äì10 mm long. The dorsal sepal is erect, 25‚Äì40 mm long, 1‚Äì3 mm wide and curves gently forwards. The lateral sepals are 26‚Äì40 mm long and 2‚Äì4 mm wide and spread widely, curving slightly downwards. The petals are 20‚Äì30 mm long, about 2 mm wide and curve downwards. The labellum is 12‚Äì18 mm long, 7‚Äì13 mm wide, and greenish-cream with a dark red tip. The sides of the labellum turn upwards, the tip is curled under and there are six to eight short linear teeth on each side. There are four rows of dark red, club-shaped calli along the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from August to October. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia stellata was first formally described in 1991 by David Jones and the description was published in Australian Orchid Research. The specific epithet (stellata) is a Latin word meaning \\"starry\\", referring to the star-like spreading of the lateral sepals and petals. Distribution and habitat The starry spider orchid occurs in New South Wales south from Rankins Springs and in eastern South Australia where it grows usually grows in Callitris woodland. The South Australian plants may belong to a separate species. Ecology Males of the wasp species Phymatothynnus nitidus have been shown to be the pollinator of this orchid when they attempt to mate with the flower.

When Cortlandt Street crosses Broadway it becomes Maiden Lane. Cortlandt Street is a west-east street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City. It runs one block from Broadway to Church Street, then continues an additional block as the non-vehicular Cortlandt Way from Church to Greenwich Street. At its eastern end, the street continues as Maiden Lane. The street, which was laid out , has varied in length over time. During the early 20th century it was the site of Radio Row, a small business district specializing in the sale and repair of radios. All except one block was razed in the mid-1960s for the construction of the World Trade Center. After the destruction of the original World Trade Center in the September 11 attacks, Cortlandt Way opened in 2012 as part of the new World Trade Center.  History  The street is named after Oloff Van Cortlandt and his family. Van Cortlandt, who arrived in New Amsterdam in 1637, was a rich brewer and leading citizen of the colony - he was burgomaster from 1655 to 1666 - and owned the land on which the street was laid. His son Stephanus Van Cortlandt was the mayor of New York from 1677 to 1678, and again from 1686 to 1688. He was the city's first native-born mayor. Stephanus' brother Jacobus Van Cortlandt was mayor from 1710 to 1711 and from 1719 to 1720. Both served under British rule. The Cortlandt Street Ferry Depot in 1893 The street has existed since before the American Revolution. Of the numerous extant maps of the city, it first appears in \\"Mrs. Buchnerd's Plan\\" which depicts the colony in 1732-35, however it does not appear on the \\"Carwitham Plan\\" of 1730 or the \\"Lyne-Bradford Plan\\" from 1731. Prior to that time, the land on which Cortlandt Street would be laid was the southern border of Trinity Church's \\"Church Farm\\" - previously known as the \\"King's Farm\\" - which went as far north as what is now Christopher Street. The Unitarian preacher John Butler rented a hall on Cortlandt Street in 1794 and lectured before crowds that his critics considered to be \\"truly alarming\\" in size. He was opposed by mainstream preachers, who vehemently criticized him in their sermons.Burrows & Wallace (1999), p.396 In 1807, Robert Fulton began scheduled ferry service from the foot of Cortlandt Street to Albany, New York via the Hudson River. The boat, initially called the North River Steamboat, later became known as the Clermont.Burrows & Wallace (1999), p.343 Ferries also ran from the Cortlandt Street Ferry Depot to New Jersey. Herman Melville's family lived on Cortlandt Street from around 1821 to 1824, during Melville's childhood, as part of their rise in status in the city after their relocation from Boston, where Melville's father was a successful merchant.Burrows & Wallace (1999), p.702 Radio Row in 1936, photographed by Berenice Abbott The former entrance to the East River Savings Bank In 1887, the Brill Brothers men's clothing store chain opened its first store at 45 Cortlandt Street. Max and Maurice Brill, whose name is on the Brill Building in midtown, expanded the one store into a chain of eight. Down the block, at 41 Cortlandt Street, the first Childs Restaurant was opened in 1889. Business owner and entrepreneur Harry L. Schneck opened City Radio on Cortlandt Street in 1921. This was a small business that sold radios and radio parts, which at the time was quite a novelty. Over the following decades, the area developed into a business district in its own right, becoming known as Radio Row., p. 167 \\"The electronic component distribution business started in the 1920s and 1930s, selling radio tubes on lower Manhattan's Cortland St....\\" In 1966, the Radio Row district was demolished and its streets were de-mapped to make way for the construction of the World Trade Center. Cortlandt Street, which until then ran to West Street, was cut back to Church Street, making it only one block long. In 1968, both the City Investing Building on Cortlandt Street and the Singer Building on Liberty Street were demolished to make way for One Liberty Plaza, a full-block 54-story office tower. 22 Cortlandt Street was built directly across from it and both projects were overseen by the Emery Roth & Sons architecture firm. After the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which had operated the World Trade Center, decided to redevelop the street grid within the World Trade Center site. One of the rebuilding proposals included building an enclosed shopping street along the path of Cortlandt Street that laid within the World Trade Center site. However, it was ultimately decided to build Cortlandt, Fulton, and Greenwich Streets, which had been destroyed during the original World Trade Center's construction. The de-mapped portion of Cortlandt Street was re-mapped as \\"Cortlandt Way\\" in 2014 as part of the development of the new World Trade Center. The newly opened portion, which is not accessible to vehicles, lies between Three and Four World Trade Center. Buildings Located at 26 Cortlandt Street is the Neo- classical/Art Deco former East River Savings Bank building, designed by Walker & Gillette and built from 1931 to 1934; it was later expanded upwards. The building is listed in the AIA Guide to New York City. It is now a Century 21 department store. Transportation Cortlandt Street is the location of subway stations on the IRT Broadway-Seventh Avenue Line () and the BMT Broadway Line (). The IRT station was destroyed as a result of the September 11 attacks, and reopened in September 2018. The BMT station was closed for a year after the attacks, and then again in 2005 to allow for construction of various parts of the new World Trade Center, including a passageway linking the station to the Fulton Center. The northbound platform re-opened in 2009 followed by the southbound in 2011. There were formerly stations at Cortlandt Street on the Ninth Avenue and Sixth Avenue elevated lines. A ferry depot, the Cortlandt Street Ferry Depot, formerly operated at the western end of Cortlandt Street along the Hudson River.

At the age of 17, Griffin joined the Irish Constabulary before volunteering to serve for the British Army in the Crimean War where he initially worked as an assistant storekeeper in the commissariat department before obtaining a commission as cornet in the Turkish contingent.The Early History of Rockhampton, J. T. S. Bird, 1904. Republished 2016. Retrieved 15 March 2017. For his service in Crimea, Griffin was awarded medals for distinguished service. When his service in Crimea finished, Griffin accepted an offer of free travel to Australia that was made available to police volunteers who served in the war, arriving in Melbourne in late 1856. During the journey, Griffin is believed to have become acquainted with a wealthy widow, who he later married but then after squandering her money, abandoned her before making her believe he had died by having his own death notice published in a newspaper which he then sent her, pretending it had been sent by one of his friends. Police career With his previous experience with the Ireland Constabulary and his service in Crimea, Griffin entered the police force in Australia. =Rockhampton= Just prior to the separation of Queensland from New South Wales, Griffin arrived in Rockhampton in 1858 as an Acting Sergeant with the New South Wales Police Force before he rose to the rank of Rockhampton's Chief Constable. After serving as Chief Constable in Rockhampton, Griffin was transferred to Brisbane in 1862 where he was appointed Acting Clerk of Petty Sessions, before he was appointed to the position permanently at the beginning of 1863. =Brisbane= During his time in Brisbane, Griffin became enamoured with the sister of a Queensland cabinet minister. It is believed Griffin influenced the minister into appointing him to higher positions by alluding to a desire to marry the minister's sister but expressing a belief that he was unable to marry until he was working in a higher-paying position. As such, Griffin was appointed to gold commissioner and police magistrate in Clermont, Queensland ‚Äì the hub of the Peak Downs goldfields. =Clermont= Griffin spent four years at Clermont, during which he became widely known. He was known to be a compulsive gambler which included frequent visits to a gambling house where it's believed Griffin accrued substantial debts after suffering considerable losses. During his time in Clermont, Griffin's character and personality was polarising. In his 1904 book, The Early History of Rockhampton, historian and journalist J. T. S. Bird described Griffin as having a very suave and attractive manner, readily gaining the friendship of those he desired to stand well with, but was also distant and overbearing and not well-liked. Although courteous to a degree, Griffin was also described as brusque. One of the people that Griffin drew the ire of was magistrate (and future Member for Clermont) Oscar de Satge whom lodged a complaint with the Colonial Secretary in April 1866, detailing various issues he had with Griffin including interference with the Bench and misuse of troopers' time along with other matters that de Satge believe warranted inquiry., including an allegation of Griffin stealing a letter addressed to de Satge.Griffin, Thomas John Augustus (1832‚Äì1868), A. A. Morrison, Australian Dictionary of Biography (Volume 4), 1972. Retrieved 15 March 2017. It was de Satge's name that headed a list of twenty signatures on a petition that was forwarded to the Colonial Secretary asking for Griffin's removal from Clermont, after a public meeting was held which was chaired by the Clermont mayor. At the meeting two resolutions were carried. The first stated that it was desirable for the welfare of the community that Thomas John Griffin should be removed from his position as Police Magistrate in consequence of the inefficient and unsatisfactory discharge of his magisterial duties. The second resolution stated that Griffin was despotic, arbitrary and partial and that Griffin had lost the confidence of the public. At the meeting, Dr. Spiridion Candiottis, who was once a good friend of Griffin's, expressed his scathing views of Griffin stating that he had only been appointed to such a high position by an unscrupulous minister. Griffin denied de Satge's allegations and requested an inquiry be held so he could clear his name. A Civil Service Board was convened in Rockhampton where complaints about Griffin were heard, but it was rule that de Satge's allegations into Griffin's interference with the Bench were unfounded and that there was no evidence to support claims Griffin had used troopers as servants. The evidence presented by manager of the Australian Joint Stock Bank, Thomas Skarratt Hall, was considered to have exonerated Griffin. Despite this, it was decided that Griffin would be removed back to Rockhampton in the position as Assistant Gold Commissioner. Before his departure from Clermont in October 1867, Griffin was afforded a farewell dinner where 35 men dined at Clermont's Leichhardt Hotel where they sang For He's A Jolly Good Fellow at the conclusion of the evening. In his speech on the night, Griffin said he felt honoured by the way his name had been received and that it was proof that the guests did not endorse the allegations that had been made against him, describing the statements made by Dr. Candiottis as false.Extracts from the Peak Downs Telegram, Rockhampton Bulletin and Central Queensland Advertiser, 15 October 1867. Retrieved (via NLA) 15 March 2017. =Return to Rockhampton= After leaving Clermont, Griffin arrived in Rockhampton to take up his new position on 19 October 1867. Two days prior, a gold escort had arrived in Rockhampton from Clermont escorted by Sergeant James Julian and two troopers. Gold escorts were regular delivery services that operated between settlements on the goldfields, such as Clermont, and major towns like Rockhampton, where gold was escorted to the bank by authorised police officers and exchanged for cash, which was then escorted back to the bank's rural branches. When he arrived in Rockhampton, Griffin began making arrangements for when the next gold escort would travel back to Clermont and who the troopers would be that would accompany it. Gold escort The next gold escort, to transport money from Rockhampton to Clermont, experienced a week of delays and false starts. The original party consisting of Griffin, Trooper Patrick Cahill and Sergeant James Julian attempted the journey but turned around and returned to Rockhampton twice. On the first occasion, they had reached Stanwell before returning for their horses to be shod. On the second occasion, they had reached Gracemere before Griffin claimed he had left a parcel of gold behind at the Rockhampton Club which had arrived on the last escort by mistake, and wanted the party to return to Rockhampton to collect it. The party, now consisting of Griffin, Cahill and Trooper John Power, finally left Rockhampton for Clermont on 1 November 1867, with Griffin indicating that he intended to travel with Cahill and Power only part of the way before returning to Rockhampton. Upon reaching the Mackenzie River, the three men camped near the Bedford Arms hotel, run by Alfred Harding Bedford. Bedford made arrangements with Griffin to travel back to Rockhampton with him the following day. Griffin and Bedford camped separately to Power and Cahill who were preparing to begin making their way to Clermont the same night. Bedford later reporting hearing gunshots during the night, which awoke him to discover Griffin not present. When Griffin returned, Bedford asked him about the shots that he had heard, but Griffin explained it away saying that he had gone to look for the horses but had got lost and had fired his pistol in an attempt to attract attention. In the early hours of 6 November 1867, Griffin and Bedford travelled back to Westwood on horseback, camping one night at Gainsford, before catching the train back to Rockhampton from Westwood, which in 1867 was the end of the line with the railway further westward yet to be constructed. Discovery of bodies After Griffin had arrived back in Rockhampton, news broke that Cahill and Power had been discovered dead near where they had camped on the Mackenzie River near Bedford's hotel, with the money that they had been escorting to Clermont missing.Telegraphic (From Our Telegraphic Correspondents), The Brisbane Courier, 11 November 1867.

He appeared to maintain his innocence prior to his death denying his guilt to everyone he saw in the prison including Reverend Alexander Smith from the Presbyterian Church who spent time with Griffin before his death. Smith had earlier complained to the Attorney-General about the police magistrate denying him entry on the grounds that Griffin belonged to the Church of England rather than the Presbyterian Church.

Confession After Griffin's execution, it was reported that he had actually confessed to his crime in his cell, but only after he had been informed that his death warrant had been signed.

Griffin is then believed to have attempted to negotiate with Grant about a possible escape if he confessed to where he hid the money he stole from the gold escort, promising Grant a portion of the money. After Griffin provided a pencil sketch of the money's approximate location, Grant is then said to have planned a night excursion with principal turnkey John Lee. Despite two attempts, Grant and Lee failed to find the hidden money. After informing the Sheriff, they were given permission to attempt to find the money again. After failing again, the Sheriff informed Tom Skarratt Hall who organised a party to search for the money. On this occasion, they found a half burnt tree stump obscured by another tree stump which had been placed up against it. When they removed the second stump, they found the valise with the missing notes which had been rolled up inside it, slightly damaged by the rain. Grant revealed that Griffin had told him that as he approached Power and Cahill's camp, Power fired his weapon at him but the bullet narrowly missed him, passing through his beard. Griffin said he returned fire which woke Cahill. When Cahill attempted to fire his pistol, the cap exploded. On the second attempt, the pistol exploded causing Cahill to accidentally shoot himself. With both the troopers dead, Griffin said he decided to make the best of the situation and steal the money, destroying their wrappers in the camp fire and rolling the notes into a swag-shaped bundle.

McDonald wrote that \\"with the advantage of hindsight, it is apparent that Griffin suffered from some form of mental illness, possibly schizophrenia\\" but as there was little knowledge of such an illness in the 1860s, his trial inevitably ended with his execution.

She is known for performing uaajeerneq, a Greenlandic mask dance that involves storytelling and centers three elements: fear, humour and sexuality. Bathory describes uaajeerneq as both a political and cultural act and an idiosyncratic art form.  Biography  Born and raised in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Bathory is of Inuk and British ancestry. Her mother, Karla Williamson, was one of the original recreators of uaajeerneq in the 1970s Greenlandic folk movement after the dance form was nearly eradicated by colonial missionaries in Greenland in the 18th‚Äì20th centuries. Bathory started learning uaajeerneq when she was thirteen and trained and performed with her mother throughout her teenage years in Saskatoon. She currently resides in Iqaluit, Nunavut with her husband and three children.  Career  = Artistic Practice = Bathory has been active in the Inuit, Indigenous, and Canadian art scenes since the 1990s and describes uaajeerneq as the cornerstone of her artistic practice. In an interview in March 2018 she explained: \\"[Uaajeerneq] makes me both open and brave to try new things, to dig deeper. I write poetry, tell stories, create theatre, performance art, video, and all of it has some sort of aspect of uaajeerneq to it.\\" Bathory describes uaajeerneq as playing with \\"four main themes: our humility as human beings in the vastness of the universe and our connection to our ancestors, sex, fear, and hilarity\\", and said that she \\"[touches] on all these themes in a performance, sometimes all at once, sometimes moving abruptly between them\\". In 2016, Bathory offered her film Timiga Nunalu, Sikulu (My Body, The Land and The Ice) as her contribution to #callresponse, a collaborative project by Indigenous women artists including Christi Belcourt (M√©tis), Maria Hupfield (Anishinaabe), Ursula Johnson (Mi'kmaq), and Tania Willard (Secwepemc). In the film, Bathory works to dismantle stereotypes of the \\"Pocahottie\\" and speaks back against consistent sexual violence perpetrated against Indigenous women. Selected representations of #callresponse projects were displayed at grunt gallery in Vancouver, BC in October‚ÄìDecember 2016. Bathory frequently collaborates with Inuk throat singer and recording artist Tanya Tagaq, including an appearance in Tagaq's 2016 music video for \\"Retribution\\" and a 2015 co-performance for #callresponse. The pair also performed together in March 2018 as part of the Beyond Worlds series presented by the Chan Centre for the Performing Arts. Of her experiences working with Tagaq, Bathory said in 2018: \\"Once we started performing together, we realized how much we sink and fly through the same realms of consciousness to create performance ‚Äì her through her voice and me through my mask dancing. It is an incredible experience to perform together: we are unique from one another and heighten one another at the same time.\\" = Qaggiavuut! Society = Along with several other grassroots Inuit performing artists, Bathory is a founding member of the Qaggiavuut! Society for a Nunavut Performing Arts Centre, a community-based organization that supports Inuit artists and is working toward building a community-centered performing arts centre in Iqaluit. Qaggiavuut! Society has been operating as a volunteer organization since 2009, and in January 2016 won the Arctic Inspiration Prize ‚Äì the first time an arts-based organization has ever won the prize. Beyond its goal of creating a Nunavut performing arts space, the organization also works to expand performing arts training for Inuit artists, to build economic opportunities for artists in the Arctic, to maintain at-risk Inuit performance art forms, and to nurture the creation of new Inuit performing arts work. Bathory began working as a program manager for Qaggiavuut! Society in 2016.

It was released in February 2017. It was one of the first two devices of the new HTC U series (with the other being the HTC U Play).  Specifications  = Hardware = The HTC U Ultra has a glass body with a non-removable 3000 mAh battery, a 5.7-inch capacitive touchscreen display with a 2.05-inch secondary display similar to the LG V20. The rear camera has a 12 megapixel sensor with optical image stabilization, dual LED flash, and a f/1.8 aperture with support for HDR. The front camera has a 16 megapixel sensor that shoots 1080p video and has an auto-HDR mode. Internal storage is either 64 or 128 gigabytes with support for microSD cards up to 256 GB and it weighs 170 grams. = Software = The HTC U Ultra ships with Android 7.0 Nougat overlaid with the HTC Sense UI. It is upgradable to Android 8.0 Oreo.  Reception  The HTC U Ultra received mixed to negative reviews. Android Police's David Ruddock liked the phone's large size and the high-gloss glass construction of the phone as well as the \\"lighter touch\\" of HTC's Sense skin that \\"includes some useful software tweaks\\", but lamented its lack of a headphone jack, its \\"poor battery life\\" which he attributed to the \\"awful\\" screen to battery ratio, its lack of carrier support and no ruggedization features and its $750 price, which he felt was \\"simply way too much\\". Andrew Martonik of Android Central praised the phone's \\"fantastic\\" performance, the \\"great\\" screen, \\"stunning\\" hardware, lack of bloatware the fact that the phone came unlocked and that it \\"absolutely nails the basics\\" but derided its \\"2016-level camera performance\\", lack of a headphone jack, the lack of utility for the second screen, no water resistance and the phone being too big for most hands. In the quick take he said \\"HTC continues to get the basics right with flagships. The U Ultra has a great screen, amazing build quality and stunning design.

Mining in Bangladesh consists mainly of coal , granite, natural gas, and petroleum mining. History In Pre-partition era of British India, coal from Garo hills of Meghalaya was transported and traded through East Bengal. Mining offices opened in Dhaka and trade was aided by British Rail network in India. In 1961 UN-Pak Mineral Survey Project started surveys in then East Pakistan (today Bangladesh) by Geological Survey of Pakistan. In 1962 the survey found 1.05 million ton of coal in Jamalganj, Sunamganj District. The next big discovery came in 1985 when Geological Survey of Bangladesh discovered coal in Dinajpur. In 1989 a coalfield was discovered in khalashpir, Rangpur District and another in 1995 in Dighipara by the Geological Survey of Bangladesh. Multinational BHP discovered Phulbari coalfield in 1997. Global Coal Management is waiting approval for the Phulbari coalfield. Bangladesh has an estimated 2 billion tonnes of coal in underground reserves in the Northwest region of the country. Bangladeshi coal reserves are underexplored because of concerns related to method, technology, and social consequences. Coal and limestone mined in Meghalaya was transported to Bangladesh, and helped the establishment of cement factories there. Coal accounts for two percent of the energy generation in Bangladesh. The government of Bangladesh has not established a unified coal policy. The Government of Bangladesh plans to increase power generation from coal to 50 percent from the present 2 percent by 2021. =Barapukuria coal mine= Barapukuria coal mine is run by the Barapukuria Coal Mining Company Limited. Barapukuria Coal Mining Company Limited is a subsidiary of the state owned Petrobangla. The mine is located in Dinajpur, this is the only active mine in Bangladesh. The locals near the mine have reported damages to their houses. The water bodies near the mine have dried up. In response the government has acquired lands near the mine. In July 2018, it was revealed that the around 142 hundred thousand tons of coal, worth over BDT 227 billion, has been misappropriated by the officials of the Barapukuria Coal Mining Company Limited. The incident became popular as Barapukuria coal scam.

Built in 1828, it is one of a small number of surviving brick district schoolhouses in the state of Massachusetts. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. Description and history The East Charlemont District School stands in a rural setting in eastern Charlemont, on the north side of MA 2 west of its junction with East Oxbow Road and crossing of Oxbow Brook. It is a single-story brick structure, with a gabled slate roof. A wood-frame ell extends to one side. The main facade is four bays wide, with the main entrance in the rightmost bay, topped by a four-light transom window. The other bays are unevenly spaced sash windows set in rectangular openings. There is a chimney at the left of the structure. The school was built in 1828, at a time when there was a small village surrounding the property. It was built largely by the efforts of East Charlemont villagers, its bricks manufactured at a nearby brickyard. The school remained in active use as a school until 1944, by which time a significant number of the village buildings had been demolished, and it served only a small number of students. Its interior has remained remarkably unchanged since its closure, in part due to a decision by the town to preserve the building, using it only for local meetings and educational tours for children.

Formation Named in honor of a father and son, John A. Inglis, a chairmen of the Secession Convention committee, and Captain John C. Inglis, the adjutant of the 8th SC Infantry who died of typhoid in Richmond on October 18, 1862, the Battery mustered into confederate service on March 20, 1862 at Darlington Court House, SC. The Battery was originally promised to fight in Virginia but instead was sent to Charleston during its early service. The company was considered to be from Darlington since most of its men were from the districts of Darlington, Williamsburg, and Charleston, as well as a few men from Chesterfield, Georgetown, Sumter, Marlboro, and Marion Districts. On March 20, 1862, Frederick Fraser Warley was elected Captain. For two years earlier he had commanded the Darlington Guards until half of the company refused to follow the colonel of its current regiment, the 1st SC Infantry (6 Months) commanded by Colonel Maxcy Gregg refused to go to Virginia. Warley helped to create a second company from these men but it is unclear whether this company is related to the Inglis Light Artillery, but Capt Warley and later Capt William Charles appear on both muster rolls. On October 17, 1863 Warley was promoted to Major, with 1st Lieutenant William E. Charles filling his position and being promoted to Captain. It eventually was attached to Lamar's Battalion, South Carolina Artillery, under Colonel Thomas G. Lamar, hero of Secessionville, which would later become the 2nd South Carolina Artillery and with the Inglis Artillery becoming Company D. First Assignments After the formation of the 2nd South Carolina Artillery, Company D was stationed on James Island, SC during the summer of 1862 as part of the First Military District, Department of SC, GA, and FL, which was under the command of Brigadier General Nathan George Evans. During the Battle of Secessionville, it was present but the terrain kept it to limited use. Afterwards Company D was transferred to Battery White in Georgetown, SC as part of the 4th Military District, Department of SC, GA, and FL, under the command of Colonel William Stephen Walker. Armed with light artillery, 32-pounders and rifled guns, it was soon engaged with a federal gunboat expedition on November 11 and within a few minutes of the beginning, the engagement ended with the retreat of the federal gunboats. They remained at Battery White until it was sent across Winyah Bay to Waccamaw Neck in May 1863. After, it was transferred to back to James Island in the First Military District, under the command of Brigadier General Roswell S. Ripley. It was during the Second Battle of Charleston Harbor that the Inglis Light Artillery came to Fort Johnson on James Island, SC. Here they helped repulse the federal attack on Charleston, along with the rest of the garrison, with ease.

It consists of only its type species: Seycellesa braueri, which is endangered and endemic to the Seychelles. Taxonomic history The type species was initially described in 1898 by the French naturalist Eug√®ne Simon, who placed it in the genus Theridion. He chose the specific epithet braueri to honor A. Brauer at the University of Marburg. His description was based on a male specimen. British arachnologist Michael Roberts described a junior synonym, T. purifum, in 1978. The specific name was described as \\"an arbitrary combination of letters\\". His description was based on a female specimen. Michael Saaristo synonymized T. purifum with T. braueri in 1999. In 2006, Saaristo circumscribed a new genus for T. braueri. He named it Robertia after Michael Roberts. However, that generic name was invalid due to a senior homonym: the synapsid genus Robertia. In 2008, Ahmet Ko√ßak and Muhabbet Kemal created a nomen novum for this genus: Seycellesa. Distribution S. braueri is endemic to the Seychelles, where it is found on the islands of Mah√© and Silhouette at elevations of . The type locality for S. braueri is Mah√©; the type locality for the junior synonym S. purifum is Morne Seychellois, central Mah√©. Its habitat is woodland. Species description The total length of the female S. braueri is ; males are smaller, with a length of . The carapace is yellow-orange in color and has a dark border and marking along its median. The color of the chelicerae, maxillae, labium, and sternum is black-tinted yellow. The opisthosoma is spherical and the chelicerae have two anterior teeth. Conservation status The IUCN Red List considers S. braueri to be endangered. Its habitat is deteriorating due to invasive plants like Cinnamomum verum. Its extent of occurrence is and its area of occupancy is .

Company The company was founded in 2000 by Larry Gold, who served as both Chairman of the Board of Directors and as the company‚Äôs first CEO. In 2013, Byron Hewett was appointed as CEO, with Gold continuing to serve as Chairman. Gold previously founded the pharmaceutical company NeXstar Pharmaceuticals, which merged with Gilead in 1999. Hewett stepped down in 2017 and board member Alister Reynolds was appointed the new CEO, who was replaced by Roy Smythe in 2018. Systems The company monitors health and disease through the analysis of protein concentration changes in biological samples. They developed the SomaScan platform, which allows scientists and researchers to identify protein biomarkers for diseases and conditions, and apply them to drug and diagnostic research and development. The hypothesis behind the analysis is that different diseases and conditions each have novel protein profiles, including in early stages of onset. As of 2013, the commercial version of the SomaScan platform could identify and quantify 1,129 protein analytes simultaneously. As of 2017, the number had increased to about 4,200. The platform is based on modified- aptamer binding technology (‚ÄúSOMAmers‚Äù) that bind to their respective target proteins in order to determine their presence and quantity in a sample. Partnerships In 2013, the company partnered with Agilent Technologies to distribute SomaScan systems to American research and educational institutions. They also signed a development deal with Quest Diagnostics to create a blood test for early-stage, non-small-cell lung cancer. They also have partnerships with Otsuka and New England Biolabs. In 2016, a study was published that used the SomaLogic system to identify nine biomarker proteins that could predict the risk of a second heart attack in those who have suffered a previous cardiovascular event. A study in Circulation also used the 9-protein cardiovascular risk score for early detection of the harmful effects of Torcetrapib. In 2016 they also developed a test to diagnose latent tuberculosis, and to predict the progression of the disease after onset. In 2019, a study was published that used the SomaScan platform to build protein- based models for 11 different health indications: liver fat, kidney filtration, percentage body fat, visceral fat mass, lean body mass, cardiopulmonary fitness, physical activity, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, diabetes risk, and primary cardiovascular event risk. The company has a long-term partnership with the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, with Novartis taking an ownership stake in SomaLogic in 2014 as a part of the extension of their initial agreement. In 2016, SomaLogic formed a collaborative partnership with Oxford University, and in 2017 joined the iCarbonX Digital Life Alliance (including an investment by iCarbonX in SomaLogic). In 2018 SomaLogic teamed with the Leeds Centre for Personalised Health and Medicine to test the SomaScan platform in clinical studies in the UK. That year SomaLogic also began to package its insights as diagnostic information for sale to other companies, focusing on proteomic data. In 2019, SomaLogic entered into a new 10-year agreement with Novartis to use the SomaScan proteomics technology in drug discovery and development efforts.‚ÄúSomaLogic Expands Agreement with Novartis‚Äù genomeweb.com. 21 October 2019. https://www.genomeweb.com/proteomics-protein-research/somalogic-expands- agreement-novartis#.XzLRyRNKi-o Also that year, SomaLogic began commercially offering health information tests on the SomaScan Platform to prescribing physicians in Colorado.

Mulder was born in Leiden, Kingdom of the Netherlands as the son of a tobacco trader. He obtained his degree as a civil engineer from what is now TU Delft in 1872. After graduation, Mulder served as a supervisor of water management on the River Waal at Herwijnen. However, after only one year, he was invited by Prince Henry, the son of King William II to establish a trading post at the northern entrance to the Suez Canal, near Port Said in Egypt. Although his contemporaries advised against the venture, Mulder lived in Egypt from August 1873 to August 1876, and built the main house, a warehouse, a coal shed, a goods shed, service residences, two piers and the foundation for a water reservoir as well as a hotel. The trading post proved commercially successful, but the venture was terminated with the unexpected death of Prince Henry in 1876. Mulder returned to the Netherlands, where he built the Change Canal in The Hague, as well as a steam-powered tramway in Haarlem. Mulder was then recruited by the government of Japan in late 1879. He was responsible for improvements to the course of the Tone River,LEAD: Crown Prince Naruhito, Dutch prince visit canal in Chiba Pref.+, AP, 14 september 2010 Kinugawa River, Fuji River, Yodo River and the Sumida River; however, in Japan he became known as a specialist in the redesign and improvements of ports and harbours. In addition to Port of Tokyo, where access had previously been hampered by large mudbanks, he also worked on ports in Okayama, Hiroshima, Hachinohe and Shimonoseki. His contemporaries in Japan included Cornelis Johannes van Doorn and Johannis de Rijke and George Arnold Escher. After his contract expired in 1890, he returned to the Hague. In 1897 he returned to the Netherland, and designed a system of steam-powered tram lines in Nijmegen. He died in Nijmegen in 1901.  References  * Gasteren, L.A. van e.a.

It has a single erect, hairy leaf and one or two pale yellow flowers which have a red-striped labellum with short teeth on its sides.Caladenia straminichila habitCaladenia straminichila labellum detail  Description  Caladenia straminichila is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and which sometimes forms clumps of up to five plants. It has a single erect leaf, 60‚Äì120 mm long, 4‚Äì6 mm wide and pale green with reddish-purple blotches. One or two yellow flowers 80-110 across are borne on a stalk 120‚Äì200 mm high. The sepals and petals are linear to lance-shaped near their base then narrow to a dark brown, thread-like glandular tip. The dorsal sepal is erect, then slightly curved forward, 60‚Äì80 mm long and 2‚Äì3 mm wide. The lateral sepals are 60‚Äì80 mm long and 2‚Äì4 mm wide and spread horizontally near the base, then curve downwards. The petals are 60‚Äì70 mm long and 1‚Äì3 mm wide and arranged like the lateral sepals. The labellum is 11‚Äì13 mm long and 9‚Äì11 mm wide and yellow with red lines and spots. The sides of the labellum have short, broad, forward-facing teeth, its tip is curled under and there are two rows of creamy yellow, glossy anvil-shaped calli up to 1.5 mm long, along its centre. Flowering occurs from August to early October.  Taxonomy and naming  Caladenia straminichila was first described in 2015 by Andrew Phillip Brown and Garry Brockman from a specimen collected near Boyup Brook and the description was published in Nuytsia. Acccording to Brown and Brockman, the specific epithet (straminichila) is derived from the Latin stramineus (straw- yellow) and chilus (-lipped), referring to the colour of the labellum. Within the same article, Brown and Brockman identify chilus as Greek. In classical Latin and ancient Greek, chilus is not attested,Lewis, C.T. & Short, C. (1879). A Latin dictionary founded on Andrews' edition of Freund's Latin dictionary. Oxford: Clarendon Press. while cheilos (œáŒµ·øñŒªŒøœÇ) means 'lip' in ancient Greek.Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940). A Greek-English Lexicon. Revised and augmented throughout by Sir Henry Stuart Jones with the assistance of Roderick McKenzie.Oxford: Clarendon Press. Before its formal description, this orchid was known as Caladenia sp. 'Moodiarrup'.  Distribution and habitat  The Tenterden yellow spider orchid occurs between the Porongurup National Park and Manjimup in the Avon Wheatbelt and Jarrah Forest biogeographic regions where it grows in with scattered shrubs in open woodland.

In the Golgi, Spitz is cleaved by a protease called Rhomboid, which releases Spitz to be trafficked to the cell membrane and released out of the cell. From here it can bind EGFR on the surface of other cells, activating the receptor. Alternatively, Spitz can be bound and inactivated by Argos, inhibiting EGFR activation.

It offers a service for customers to compare a range of general insurance, health insurance, life insurance, energy and personal finance products. The company is well known for its ‚ÄòCompare the Meerkat‚Äô marketing campaign created by communications agency VCCP and starring CGI Russian billionaire meerkat Aleksandr Orlov, voiced by Simon Greenall.  History in Australia  Comparethemarket.com.au was launched in Australia in 2012, six years after the launch of comparethemarket.com in the United States & UK. Using the comparethemarket.com.au service, Australian customers can compare a number of products based on price, features, and more. These products include health insurance, car insurance, and energy. In 2015, the company signed a deal to secure Bupa, one of Australia's largest health insurers, as a participating health fund. The deal ensured that Bupa products could be compared on comparethemarket.com.au, alongside products from health funds like ahm (owned by Medibank) and HBF Health Fund. Comparethemarket.com.au was the first commercial comparison website in Australia to disclose the amount of commission it receives from participating health funds. As of 2016, the standardised flat fee equated to a net present value of 27.75 percent of the first-year premium of the health insurance product sold by the company. Comparethemarket.com.au continues to compete against other comparison services in Australia, like iSelect and Choosi.  Meerkat Campaign  Compare the Market is perhaps best known for its marketing campaigns featuring meerkat characters Aleksandr Orlov and his Head of IT, Sergei. The meerkat advertisements started with Aleksandr Orlov's mission to clear the confusion up for Australians who mistook his website comparethemeerkat.com.au for comparethemarket.com.au. The same marketing campaign was launched years earlier in the United Kingdom for comparethemarket.com, which ended up topping a Nielsen consumer poll to be dubbed ‚ÄúUK‚Äôs most loved ad‚Äù. As of 2017, the UK business continues to use these characters in their own marketing. Another meerkat character, Baby Oleg, was introduced at the end of 2015. The storyline continued with Aleksandr Orlov buying the Compare the Market business, and introduced a human character named Tom. In 2017, the company launched a limited run of meerkat toys for their health insurance customers. Aleksandr's catchphrase, ‚Äúsimples‚Äù, is so well known that it can be found in both the Macmillan English dictionary, as well as the Oxford English Dictionary.

North Sea The Ganzepoot (Dutch for goose foot) is a series of locks and spillways in the inner port of Nieuwpoort, Belgium which connect one river, three water channels and two canals with the mouth of the Yser River and the maritime port. The spillways control the level of the two channels and the drainage of the polders. The Ganzepoot was built in the second half of 19th century but was almost completely destroyed in World War I. The name comes from the fact that infrastructure collectively resembles a six-toed goose foot.

The creek became unnavigable in the 17th century due to the absence of a lock. The pre-1914 reconstruction preserves some markedly different methods than current views. * The obsolete lock Iepersas between the recanalized Yser and its mouth; no longer used for shipping, with a spillway on the left with five openings.

This is the famous spillway where Hendrik Geeraert and Fernand Ume opened the gates on October 29, 1914, flooding the lands between the Yser and the old Nieuwpoort-Diksmuide railroad, and stopping the advance of German troops in World War I. At that time, the sliding gates were opened manually by hand- crank; nowadays the operation is motorized. * The Veurnesas a drainage sluice at the beginning of the Nieuwpoort-Dunkirk Canal.

A male has not yet been identified, and there is very little known about the biology and behavior of this species and its relatives. The original description lacks many of the morphological details helpful for identification, though it is similar to other members of the Bominae subfamily, including Boliscus and Bomis. Eug√®ne Simon described a second species C. tuberculata in 1886, but it was later made the type species of Boliscus.

She was also governor of Dagon from 1364 to 1392. Prior to her brief reign as regent, she had been a close adviser of her brother since 1369, and the de facto ruler of the kingdom since the early 1380s. But she never gained the support of the court. Powerful factions of the court used her alleged long-term affair with her much younger nephew-in-law Smim Maru to undermine her influence. When her nephew and adopted son Binnya Nwe raised a rebellion in 1383, Chief Minister Zeik-Bye secretly sided with Nwe. Her ailing brother formally handed her power in October 1383. She could not defeat Nwe's rebellion. After Binnya U's death two months later, the court chose Nwe, who ascended the throne with the title of Razadarit. The new king reappointed his adoptive mother to her old post at Dagon but purely in a ceremonial role. Early life She was born Mwei Na (,Pan Hla 2005: 394 ) to Princess Sanda Min Hla, and Prince Saw Zein. Her parents were first cousins.Pan Hla 2005: 39 At birth, she received the title Wihara Dewi because she was born during the construction of a monastery donated by her father.Pan Hla 2005: 65 Na had two full siblings: an elder sister Mwei Ne, and a younger brother Binnya U.Pan Hla 2005: 40 Since her younger brother was born in 1323/24,Pan Hla 2005: 161 Na was born in or before 1322. Shortly after her birth, her father became king of Martaban. Na became the king's eldest surviving child as Ne died young. The king gave Na the title \\"Maha Dewi\\", the name by which she would be known. The two siblings became fatherless in 1330 when Saw Zein died.Pan Hla 2005: 41 The young royals remained important as their powerful mother placed two successive kings and made herself their chief queen until 1348.Pan Hla 2005: 42‚Äì44 Princess of Dagon The princess remained unmarried well into her mid-twenties. In 1348, Binnya U ascended the Martaban throne, and made his sister marry Bon La, son of the powerful minister Than-Daw in a marriage alliance. The new king also made Bon La governor of Dagon (modern central Yangon) with the title of Bya Hta-Baik.Pan Hla 2005: 45 In the following years, her husband became an important ally of her brother. In 1362, Binnya U raised the Shwedagon Pagoda in Dagon to 20 meters (66 feet).Harvey 1925: 112 It was also the last year of peace in the kingdom. In 1363, while the king and his retinue were away from the capital Martaban (Mottama), a rival faction led by Prince Byattaba seized the throne. Byattaba's brother Laukpya also raised a rebellion in the Irrawaddy delta. The king sent Bya Hta-Baik with an army to retake the capital. But the commander was killed by poison by Byattaba's wife and Maha Dewi's younger half-sister Tala Mi Ma-Hsan during truce negotiations.Pan Hla 2005: 53 Maha Dewi had little time to mourn. Her brother quickly married her off to Zeya Thura, governor of Hmawbi, whom he had appointed as the next commander-in-chief. But Zeya Thura died in action soon after in the subsequent attack on Martaban. After Zeya Thura's death, Binnya U appointed her governor of Dagon.Pan Hla 2005: 54 Governor of Dagon Maha Dewi proved an able governor. She became a much needed ally to her brother, who was now based out of Donwun, about 100 km north of Martaban. Her effective control of Dagon provided a backstop to Laukpya's forces from coming into the central Pegu province (modern Yangon Region and southern Bago Region). Smim Than-Byat, a brother of Byattaba and Laukpya but loyal to Binnya U, successfully defended the Pegu province from Laukpya's attacks from the west.Pan Hla 2005: 55 But things turned for worse in 1369/70. That year, Byattaba's forces drove out Binnya U from Donwun. Binnya U's territory was now reduced to the Pegu province alone. He moved the capital to Pegu (Bago), about 60 km northeast of Dagon.Pan Hla 2005: 57 Power broker at Pegu Her power grew even as her brother's domain shrank. The king, after the death of his trusted chief minister Pun-So in 1369, came to rely on his sister for advice.Pan Hla 2005: 58‚Äì59 When Gov. Than-Byat of Syriam switched sides, it was Maha Dewi that planned the counterattack. She appointed Gen. Yawga Rat and Smim Maru to retake Syriam, across the river from her fiefdom of Dagon. The operation was successful, and Binnya U held on to the Pegu province.Pan Hla 2005: 66(Pan Hla 2005: 62‚Äì63): Binnya U was still in a precarious position. He decided to accept a truce with Byattaba and Laukpya. According to the Pak Lat Chronicles, he had to pay them 16.33 kg of gold and ten elephants in exchange for the brothers' nominal submission. Her rise however was not universally accepted. A court faction led by Chief Minister Zeik-Bye surreptitiously opposed her. The opposition became stronger about three years later when the princess, now in her 50s, allegedly became involved with a much younger Maru, who was the husband of Binnya U's daughter (and her niece) Tala Mi Thiri. The affair became public, and the people of Pegu began ridiculing her. The chronicle Razadarit Ayedawbon reports two supposedly contemporary verses which in vivid language strongly disparage the princess for having a scandalous \\"home- wrecking\\" affair at an old age with a younger married man.Pan Hla 2005: 67‚Äì68 The affair reportedly is the source of the Mon proverb: \\"The old peahen climbs up a tree to lay a clutch of eggs; the old woman brazenly steals another woman's husband.\\"Fernquest Spring 2006: 5 At any rate, she retained her brother's trust. He handed her more power over the years as his health continued to deteriorate.Pan Hla 2005: 68‚Äì69 Jockeying for power became more fierce. More factions now allied themselves with the princess and Maru.Pan Hla 2005: 72 The Maha Dewi‚ÄìMaru faction was firmly in power by the early 1380s when the king's health rapidly declined. By 1382, she was the de facto ruler.Pan Hla 2005: 81 The main opposition to her rule would come from her nephew and adopted son Binnya Nwe in 1383.Pan Hla 2005: 82‚Äì83 Rebellion by Binnya Nwe The princess had adopted Binnya U's son Binnya Nwe since his birth. (The mother Queen Mwei Daw died soon after giving birth to him.)Pan Hla 2005: 61 Maha Dewi had raised him like her own son who was never his father's favorite. Indeed, the king deemed him \\"ruthless\\", and once told his sister that Nwe was not to ascend the throne.Pan Hla 2005: 64 (The king had chosen the younger son Baw Ngan-Mohn as heir-apparent.) Nwe responded in kind. In 1382, he eloped with his half-sister Tala Mi Daw much to the chagrin of their ailing father. The young couple was soon caught and Nwe was imprisoned. Maha Dewi had to repeatedly plead with her brother to free Nwe, and allow the young couple to be married. Her brother finally relented; she wedded the young couple. It was all for naught. By then, Nwe as well as Ngan-Mohn had come to consider Maha Dewi as the enemy, believing that she would put her lover on the throne instead. Zeik-Bye had been instigating; he had warned Nwe that Maha Dewi and Maru were plotting to arrest him. By 22 April 1383, Nwe had decided to revolt.(Pan Hla 2005: 92): Binnya Nwe decided to revolt before 6th waning of Kason 745 ME (Wed, 22 April 1383). In the wee hours of 5 May 1383, Nwe and his 30 men fled to Dagon, and seized the governor's residence at Dagon.(Pan Hla 2005: 94): Night of Tuesday, 3rd waxing of Nayon 745 ME = Monday, 4 May 1383. The day had turned to Tuesday, 5 May 1383. At first, she did not make much of the \\"rebellion\\". The ailing king was more annoyed, and asked his sister to handle the situation. She thought about sending a battalion. But Zeik-Bye advised against it, characterizing the insurrection as a harmless exercise by a restless teenager.Pan Hla 2005: 105 She agreed and instead sent a delegation to Dagon, asking Nwe to come back. Nwe sent back a conciliatory letter, saying that he still regarded her as his mother, and that he would soon return by August.Pan Hla 2005: 106, 108 But he never planned to. He went on recruiting local governors around Dagon to come over to his side. On 18 August 1383, she sent another delegation.(Pan Hla 2005: 112): 6th waning of Tawthalin 745 ME = 18 Aug 1383 Nwe again told the envoys that he would soon return. Shortly after, she received news that Nwe had sent missions to enlist help from Martaban and Myaungmya. She rushed her own delegations to the nominal vassals.Pan Hla 2005: 122‚Äì123 On 27 August 1383,End of Tawthalin 745 ME = 27 August 1383 she decided to use force at the end of the rainy season.Pan Hla 2005: 125 Regency A 19th century Burmese painting depicting white umbrellas used as regalia Meanwhile, Binnya U's health deteriorated markedly. He could not even attend meetings with the court anymore. In October, he officially handed power to his sister, giving her the right to raise the white umbrella, a symbol of Burmese sovereigns.Per (Pan Hla 2005: 129), Binnya U transferred power on or a few days before the army left for Dagon on 3rd waxing of Nadaw 745 ME (Wed, 28 Oct 1383). The act formalized what had been the reality for sometime. She was now referred to as Min Maha Dewi (\\"Queen Maha Dewi\\").Pan Hla 2005: 150 However, she continued to refer to her brother as the sovereign in her official edicts.Pan Hla 2005: 129 Her first order was to retake Dagon. She had appointed Maru to lead the vanguard force, and Zeik-Bye the rearguard. On 28 October 1383, three armies‚Äîfrom Pegu, Martaban and Myaungmya‚Äîleft for Dagon.(Pan Hla 2005: 129): According to the Razadarit Ayedawbon, three armies from Pegu, Martaban and Myaungmya marched to Dagon. The Pak Lat Chronicles say that an army from Toungoo went too. However, Toungoo was a vassal state of Ava in 1383 as an Ava loyalist Phaungga of Toungoo had taken over Toungoo per (Sein Lwin Lay 2006: 24‚Äì25). Martaban and Myaungmya, which were nominal vassals, sent their armies mainly to monitor the situation. Nwe had already made several defensive preparations based on Zeik- Bye's reports. The three armies set up camp outside Dagon but could not agree on a coordinated plan. Meanwhile, Nwe sent envoys to Myaungmya and Martaban camps that the fight was strictly between him and Maha Dewi. The missions worked. The Myaungmya army first turned back, followed by the Martaban force a few days later.Pan Hla 2005: 145, 147‚Äì148 On 19 November 1383,(Pan Hla 2005: 154): 10th waning of Nadaw 745 ME = 19 Nov 1383 Nwe moved in on Maru's vanguard army. With Zeik-Bye's rearguard staying clear of the fight, Maru was driven back.Pan Hla 2005: 154 Suddenly, it was her regime that was in trouble. She could not comprehend how Nwe's small band of men could have defeated the Pegu army. But she also realized from the open bickering between Zeik-Bye and Maru that she was in no position to organize another attack. She ordered an immediate upgrade of Pegu's moats and fortified walls. Zeik-Bye meanwhile kept Nwe apprised of the developments.Pan Hla 2005: 155 By then, her authority was too weak. When Nwe and his small army appeared outside Pegu's walls on 10 December 1383,(Pan Hla 2005: 156): Thursday, 12th waning of Pyatho 745 ME = Sunday, 20 December 1383. It was more likely Thursday, 2nd waning of Pyatho 745 ME (Thursday, 10 December 1383). she could do nothing other than hunker down inside the city walls.Pan Hla 2005: 156 The stalemate ended with Binnya U's death on 2 January 1384. Maru tried to rally the court but found no support. When he and his wife tried to flee, they were captured.Pan Hla 2005: 157‚Äì158 On 4 January 1384,(Pan Hla 2005: 356, footnote 1): Monday, 12th waxing of Tabodwe 745 ME = 4 January 1384 the Zeik-Bye-led court handed the power to Nwe. The next day, Nwe ascended the throne with the title of Razadarit.Pan Hla 2005: 161 The new king decided not to punish his adoptive mother. He reappointed her to her post at Dagon but strictly in a ceremonial role.Pan Hla 2005: 164 Last years Maha Dewi lived out her last years at Dagon. She was not part of Razadarit's regime. In the next seven years, she saw her adopted son not only reunite the three Mon-speaking regions by force but also successfully withstand three invasions by the northern Ava Kingdom.Harvey 1925: 113‚Äì114Htin Aung 1967: 88 She died 1392.The Razadarit Ayedawbon chronicle (Pan Hla 2005: 203) says that Maha Dewi died in the same year in which Queen Piya Yaza Dewi died and King Binnya Ran I was born. The Razadarit (Pan Hla 2005: 203) states that Queen Piya Yaza Dewi died after Ava troops retreated from the Tharrawaddy frontier, and that Razadarit raised Mwei Ohn- Naung as the chief queen in the month of Kason of that year, without explicitly identifying the year. The prior year mentioned in the chronicle was on (Pan Hla 2005: 197), which says that Ava troops came down to retake Gu-Htut in 754 ME (29 March 1392 to 28 March 1393), and after a dry season campaign, the troops retreated from Tharrawaddy. The narrative (Pan Hla 2005: 197‚Äì203) suggests by the time the queen died, the year had already turned (since he raised the next queen in the month of Kason.) But the dateline of the narrative is inconsistent with that of the standard chronicles. According to (Maha Yazawin Vol. 1 2006: 301‚Äì303) and (Hmannan Vol. 1 2003: 429‚Äì432), Ava troops marched south to retake Gu Htut in 752 ME (1390/91), and went to Tharrawaddy in the dry season of 753 ME (1391/92), and left the frontier in or before 754 ME. According to the standard chronicles, in the dry season of 754 ME (1392‚Äì93), Ava was at war with Mohnyin in the north, and not in the south. It means, if Queen Piya did die after the Ava troops had just left as Razadarit suggests, Piya Yaza Dewi and Maha Dewi likely died a year earlier, in or before Kason 754 ME (23 March 1392 to 21 April 1392). In 1394, Razadarit gave his newborn daughter Shin Sawbu the title of Wihara Dewi, the same title his adoptive mother was given at birth over seven decades earlier.Pan Hla 2005: 368 footnote 1 Ancestry Below is her ancestry according to the chronicle Razadarit Ayedawbon.

It is among the oldest known eukaryotic life forms and dates to about 1600 million years. The genus is named after Rafat Azmi, the Indian paleontologist who discovered other fossils in the same area and whose findings were doubted. Some microfossils as well as small shelly fossils were first described by Rafat Azmi in 1998 from Rohtasgarh limestone, and he described them as Cambrian presumably based on conventional ideas on the origin of life. Accusations were made against Azmi and fraud was suspected (at a time when the major fraud of the Indian paleontologist Vishwa Jit Gupta had been unearthed). These findings were investigated as it was in gross contradiction to the known age of the regions in question. A re-examination by others in the region failed to find the fossils claimed by him. However a Swedish team collected in another nearby region and examined microfossils and also noted that they clearly were not Cambrian but proterozoic as expected for the region. The Vindhyan region is made of older rocks and the presence of fossils raised considerable interest and further studies were carried out and in 2017, these were announced as clear and unquestionably traces of living organisms. The cells have been said to be similar to oscillatoriacean cyanobacteria and probably multicellular red algae (Rhodophyta). It thus pushes back the age of the oldest red alga by about 400 million years to an age of about 1,650 ¬± 89 (2œÉ) million years ago. Rafat Azmi's 1998 studies and claims came under a cloud of doubt and were re-examined by the Geological Society of India which claimed in a report that they failed to find the small shelly fossils reported by him. The 2017 studies were based on visits to sites in central India and fresh collections were made by Swedish researchers led by Stefan Bengtson. Their initial studies showed that their fossils were not Cambrian, but a billion years older. The 2017 studies visualized the filamentous structures using Synchrotron-Radiation X-ray Tomographic Microscopy (SRXTM) renderings and attempted to place the affinities of the life-forms as shown by the evidence. Based on their studies Rafatazmia may be the oldest known confirmably eukaryotic fossil organism.

This effort was overseen by three Spanish kingdoms during the early 16th century: the Crown of Castile in 1500‚Äì1502, followed by Navarre in 1515‚Äì1516, and lastly the Crown of Aragon in 1523‚Äì1526. After Christian kingdoms finished their reconquest of Al-Andalus on 2 January 1492, the Muslim population stood between 500,000 and 600,000 people. At this time Muslims who lived under Christian rule were given the status of Mud√©jar, legally allowing the open practice of Islam. In 1499, the Archbishop of Toledo, Cardinal Francisco Jim√©nez de Cisneros began a campaign in the city of Granada to force religious compliance with Christianity with torture and imprisonment; this triggered a Muslim rebellion. The rebellion was eventually quelled and then used to justify revoking the Muslims' legal and treaty protections. Conversion efforts were redoubled, and by 1501, officially, no Muslim remained in Granada. Encouraged by the success in Granada, the Castile's Queen Isabella issued an edict in 1502 which banned Islam for all of Castile. With the annexation of the Iberian Navarre in 1515, more Muslims still were forced to observe Christian beliefs under the Castilian edict. The last realm to impose conversion was the Crown of Aragon, whose kings had previously been bound to guarantee the freedom of religion for its Muslims under an oath included in their coronations. In the early 1520s, an anti-Islam uprising known as the Revolt of the Brotherhoods took place, and Muslims under the rebel territories were forced to convert. When the Aragon royal forces, aided by Muslims, suppressed the rebellion, King Charles I (better known as Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire) ruled that those forcible conversions were valid; thus, the \\"converts\\" were now officially Christians. This placed the converts under the jurisdiction of the Spanish Inquisition. Finally, in 1524, Charles petitioned Pope Clement VII to release the king from his oath protecting Muslims' freedom of religion. This granted him the authority to officially act against the remaining Muslim population; in late 1525, he issued an official edict of conversion: Islam was no longer officially extant throughout Spain. While adhering to Christianity in public was required by the royal edicts and enforced by the Spanish Inquisition, evidence indicated that most of the forcibly converted (known as the \\"Moriscos\\") clung to Islam in secret. In daily public life, traditional Islamic law could no longer be followed without persecution by the Inquisition; as a result, the Oran fatwa was issued to acknowledge the necessity of relaxing sharia, as well as detailing the ways in which Muslims were to do so. This fatwa become the basis for the crypto-Islam practiced by the Moriscos until their expulsions in 1609‚Äì1614. Some Muslims, many near the coast, emigrated in response to the conversion. However, restrictions placed by the authorities on emigration meant leaving Spain was not an option for many. Rebellions also broke out in some areas, especially those with defensible mountainous terrain, but they were all unsuccessful. Ultimately, the edicts created a society in which devout Muslims who secretly refused conversion coexisted with former Muslims who became genuine practicing Christians, up until the expulsion.  Background  The Capitulation of Granada by Francisco Pradilla Ortiz (1848‚Äì1921), depicting the 1492 surrender of Granada, the last Muslim-ruled kingdom in the Iberian Peninsula. Islam has been present in the Iberian Peninsula since the Umayyad conquest of Hispania in the eighth century. At the beginning of the twelfth century, the Muslim population in the Iberian Peninsula ‚Äì called \\"Al-Andalus\\" by the Muslims ‚Äì was estimated to number as high as 5.5 million; among these were Arabs, Berbers and indigenous converts. In the next few centuries, as the Christians pushed from the north in a process called reconquista, the Muslim population declined. At the end of the fifteenth century, the Reconquista culminated in the fall of Granada, with the Muslim population of Spain estimated to be between 500,000 and 600,000 out of a total Spanish population of 7 to 8 million. Approximately half of the Muslims lived in the former Emirate of Granada, the last independent Muslim state in the Iberian Peninsula, which had been annexed by the Crown of Castile. About 20,000 Muslims lived in other territories of Castile, and most of the remainder lived in the territories of the Crown of Aragon. These Muslims living under Christian rule were known as the Mud√©jars. In the initial years after the conquest of Granada, Muslims in Granada and elsewhere continued to enjoy freedom of religion. This right was guaranteed in various legal instruments, including treaties, charters, capitulations, and coronation oaths. For example, the Treaty of Granada (1491) guaranteed religious tolerance to the Muslims of the conquered Granada. Kings of Aragon, including King Ferdinand II and Charles V, swore to protect the Muslims' religious freedom in their oaths of coronation. Three months after the conquest of Granada, in 1492, the Alhambra Decree ordered all Jews in Spain to be expelled or converted; this marked the beginning of a set of new policies. In 1497, Spain's western neighbor Portugal expelled its Jewish and Muslim populations, as arranged by Spain's cardinal Cisneros in exchange for a royal marriage contract. Unlike the Jews, Portuguese Muslims were allowed to relocate overland to Spain, and most did.  Conversion process  In the beginning of the sixteenth century, Spain was split between two realms: Crown of Castile and the smaller Crown of Aragon. The marriage between King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile united the two crowns, and ultimately their grandson Charles would inherit both crowns (as Charles I of Spain, but better known as Charles V, per his regnal number as Holy Roman Emperor). Despite the union, the lands of the two crowns functioned very differently, with disparate laws, ruling priorities, and treatment of Muslims. There were also Muslims living in the Kingdom of Navarre, which was initially independent but was annexed by Castile in 1515. Forced conversion varied in timeline by ruling body: it was enacted by the Crown of Castile in 1500‚Äì1502, in Navarre in 1515‚Äì1516, and by the Crown of Aragon in 1523‚Äì1526. = In the Crown of Castile =  Kingdom of Granada  Kingdom of Granada (red) within the Crown of Castile (solid black borders) Initial efforts at forcing the conversions of Spanish Muslims were started by Cardinal Cisneros, the archbishop of Toledo, who arrived in Granada in the autumn of 1499. In contrast to Granada's own archbishop Hernando de Talavera, who had friendly relations with the Muslim population and relied on a peaceful approach towards conversions, Cisneros adopted harsh and authoritarian measures. He sent uncooperative Muslims, especially noblemen, to prison where they were treated severely (including reports of torture) until they converted. Cisneros ignored warnings from his council that these methods might violate the Treaty of Granada, which guaranteed the Muslims freedom of religion. Instead, he intensified his efforts, and in December he wrote to Pope Alexander VI that he converted 3,000 Muslims in a single day. The forced conversions led to a series of rebellions, initially started in the city of Granada. This uprising was precipitated by the riotous murder of a constable who had been transporting a Muslim woman for interrogation through the Muslim quarter of Granada; it ended with negotiations, after which the Muslims laid down their weapons and handed over those responsible for the murder of the constable. Subsequently, Cisneros convinced King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella that by attempting a rebellion, the Muslims lost their rights in the treaty, and must now accept conversions. The monarchs sent Cisneros back to Granada to preside over a renewed conversion campaign. Muslims in the city were forcibly converted in large numbers60,000 according to the Pope, in a letter to Cisneros in March 1500. Cisneros declared in January 1500 that \\"there is no one in the city who is not a Christian.\\" Although the city of Granada was now under Christian control, the uprising spread to the Granadan countryside. The leader of the rebellion fled to the Alpujarra mountains in January 1500. Fearing that they would also be forced to convert, the population there quickly rose up in insurrection. However, after a series of campaigns in 1500‚Äì01 in which 80,000 Christian troops were mobilized and King Ferdinand personally directed some operations, the rebellion was defeated. The terms of surrender of the defeated rebels generally required them to accept baptism. By 1501, not a single unconverted Muslim remained in Granada.  Rest of Castile  Unlike the Muslims of Granada, who were under Muslim rule until 1492, Muslims in the rest of Castile had lived under Christian rule for generations. Following the conversions in Granada, Isabella decided to impose a conversion-or-expulsion decree against the Muslims. Castile outlawed Islam in legislation dated July 1501 in Granada, but it was not immediately made public. The proclamation took place on February 12, 1502, in Seville (called the \\"key date\\" of this legislation by historian L. P. Harvey), and then locally in other towns. The edict affected \\"all kingdoms and lordships of Castile and Leon\\". According to the edict, all Muslim males aged 14 or more, or females aged 12 or more, should convert or leave Castile by the end of April 1502. Both Castile-born Muslims and immigrants were subject to the decree, but slaves were excluded in order to respect the rights of their owners. The edict justified the decision by saying that after the successful conversion of Granada, allowing Muslims in the rest of Castile would be scandalous, even though it acknowledged that these Muslims were peaceful. The edict also argued that the decision was needed to protect those who accepted conversion from the influence of the non-converted Muslims. On paper, the edict ordered expulsion rather than a forced conversion, but it forbade nearly all possible destinations; in reality, the Castilian authorities preferred Muslims to convert than emigrate. Castile's western neighbor Portugal had already banned Muslims since 1497. The order explicitly forbade going to other neighboring regions, such as the Kingdoms of Aragon and Valencia, the Principality of Catalonia, and the Kingdom of Navarre. Of possible overseas destination, North Africa and territories of the Ottoman Empire were also ruled out. The edict allowed travel to Egypt, then ruled by the Mamluk Sultanate, but there were few ships sailing between Castile and Egypt in those days. It designated Biscay in the Basque country as the only port where the Muslims could depart, which meant that those from the south (such as Andalusia) would have to travel the entire length of the peninsula. The edict also set the end of April 1502 as the deadline, after which Islam would become outlawed and those harboring Muslims would be punished severely. A further edict issued on September 17, 1502, forbade the newly converted Muslims to leave Castile within the next two years. Historian L.P. Harvey wrote that with this edict, \\"in such a summary fashion, at such short notice\\", Muslim presence under the Mud√©jar status came to an end. Unlike in Granada, there were few surviving records of events such as mass baptisms, or how the conversions were organized. There are records of Christian celebrations following the conversions, such as a \\"fairly elaborate festivity\\" involving a bullfight in √Åvila. = In Navarre = The lands of Navarre south of the Pyrenees (red) were annexed by Castile in 1515, thus extending Castile's prohibition of Islam there. Navarre's queen Catherine de Foix () and her co-ruling husband John III had no interest in pursuing expulsion or forced conversions. When the Spanish Inquisition arrived in Navarre in the late fifteenth century and began harassing local Muslims, the Navarran royal court warned it to cease. However, in 1512, Navarre was invaded by Castile and Aragon. The Spanish forces led by King Ferdinand quickly occupied the Iberian half of the kingdom, including the capital Pamplona; in 1513, he was proclaimed King. In 1515, Navarre was formally annexed by the Crown of Castile as one of its kingdoms. With this conquest, the 1501‚Äì02 edict of conversion came into effect in Navarre, and the Inquisition was tasked with enforcing it. Unlike in Castile, however, few Muslims appeared to accept the conversion. Historian Brian A. Catlos argues that the lack of baptismal records and a high volume of land sales by Muslims in 1516 indicate that most of them simply left Navarre to escape through the lands of the Crown of Aragon to North Africa (the Crown of Aragon was by this time inhospitable to Muslims). Some also stayed despite the order; for example, in 1520, there were 200 Muslims in Tudela who were wealthy enough to be listed in the registers. = In the Crown of Aragon = The Crown of Aragon in Spain Despite presiding over the conversions of Muslims in his wife's Castilian lands, Ferdinand II did not extend the conversions to his Aragonese subject. Kings of Aragon, including Ferdinand, were required to swear an oath of coronation to not forcibly convert their Muslim subjects. He repeated the same oath to his Cortes (assembly of estates) in 1510, and throughout his life, he was unwilling to break it. Ferdinand died in 1516, and was succeeded by his grandson Charles V, who also swore the same oath at his coronation. The first wave of forced conversions in the Crown of Aragon happened during the Revolt of the Brotherhoods. Rebellion bearing an anti-Muslim sentiment broke out among the Christian subjects of Valencia in the early 1520s, and those active in it forced Muslims to become Christians in the territories they controlled. Muslims joined the Crown in suppressing the rebellion, playing crucial roles in several battles. After the rebellion was suppressed, the Muslims regarded the conversions forced by the rebels as invalid and returned to their faith. Subsequently, King Charles I (also known as Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire) started an investigation to determine the validity of the conversions. The commission tasked with this investigation started working in November 1524. Charles ultimately upheld the conversions, putting the forcibly converted subjects under the authority of the Inquisition. Supporters of this decision argued that the Muslims had a choice when confronted by the rebels: they could have chosen to refuse and die, but did not, indicating that the conversions happened out of free will and must remain in effect. At the same time, Charles tried to release himself from the oath he swore to protect the Muslims. He wrote to Pope Clement VII in 1523 and again in 1524 for this dispensation. Clement initially resisted the request, but issued in May 1524 a papal brief releasing Charles from the oath and absolving him from all perjuries that might arise from breaking it. The Pope also authorized the Inquisition to suppress oppositions to the upcoming conversions. On November 25, 1525, Charles issued an edict ordering the expulsion or conversion of remaining Muslims in the Crown of Aragon. Similar to the case in Castile, even though the option of exile was available on paper, in practice it was almost impossible. In order to leave the realm, a Muslim would have had to obtain documentation from Siete Aguas on Aragon's western border, then travel inland across the entire breadth of Castile to embark by sea from A Coru√±a in the northwest coast. The edict set a deadline of December 31 in the Kingdom of Valencia, and January 26, 1526, in Aragon and Catalonia. Those who failed to arrive on time would be subject to enslavement. A subsequent edict said that those who did not leave by December 8 would need to show proof of baptism. Muslims were also ordered to \\"listen without replying\\" to Christian teachings. A very small number of Muslims managed to escape to France and from there to the Muslim North Africa. Some revolted against this orderfor example, a revolt broke out in the Serra d'Espad√†. The crown's troops defeated this rebellion in a campaign which included the killing of 5,000 Muslims. After the defeat of the rebellions, the entire Crown of Aragon was now nominally converted to Christianity. Mosques were demolished, first names and family names were changed, and the religious practice of Islam was driven underground.  Muslim reaction  = Crypto-Islam = A passage from the works of the Young Man of Ar√©valo, a crypto-Muslim writer in the sixteenth century. For those who could not emigrate, conversion was the only option to survive. However, the forcible converts and their descendants (known as the \\"Moriscos\\") continued to practice Islam in secret. According to Harvey, \\"abundant, overwhelming evidence\\" indicated that most forcible converts were secret Muslims. Historical evidence such as Muslims' writings and Inquisition records corroborated the former's retained religious beliefs. Generations of Moriscos were born and died within this religious climate. However, the newly converted were also pressured to conform outwardly to Christianity, such as by attending Mass or consuming food and drink which are forbidden in Islam. The situation led to a non-traditional form of Islam in which one's internal intention (niyya), rather than external observation of rituals and laws, was the defining characteristic of one's faith. Hybrid or undefined religious practice featured in many Morisco texts: for example, the works of the Morisco writer Young Man of Ar√©valo from the 1530s described crypto-Muslims using Christian worship as replacement for regular Islamic rituals. He also wrote about the practice of secret congregational ritual prayer (salat jama'ah), collecting alms in order to perform the pilgrimage to Mecca (although it is unclear whether the journey was ultimately achieved), and the determination and hope among the secret Muslims to reinstitute the full practice of Islam as soon as possible.  Oran fatwa  The Oran fatwa was a fatwa (an Islamic legal opinion) issued in 1504 to address the crisis of the 1501‚Äì1502 forced conversions in Castile. It was issued by North African Maliki scholar Ahmad ibn Abi Jum'ah and set out detailed relaxations of sharia (Islamic law) requirements, allowing Muslims to conform outwardly to Christianity and perform acts that were ordinarily forbidden when necessary to survive. The fatwa included less stringent instructions for the performance of ritual prayers, ritual charity, and ritual ablution; it also told the Muslims how to act when obliged to violate Islamic law, such as by worshiping as Christians, performing blasphemy, or consuming pork and wine. The fatwa enjoyed wide currency among the converted Muslims and their descendants, and one of the surviving Aljamiado translations was dated 1564, 60 years after the original fatwa was issued. Harvey called it \\"the key theological document\\" for the study of Spanish Islam following the forced conversions up to the Expulsion of the Moriscos, a description which Islamic studies scholar Devin Stewart repeated. = Emigration = Muslims who wished to emigrate following the edict in Aragon were required to get documentation in Siete Aguas in the south-east and then travel through an overland route to A Coru√±a in the north-west of Castile. Because this prescribed method was so difficult to complete within the imposed deadline, in practice the Muslims of Aragon had to accept forcible conversion. The predominant position of Islamic scholars had been that a Muslim could not stay in a country where rulers made proper religious observance impossible: therefore, a Muslim's obligation was to leave when they were able to. Even before the systematic forced conversion, religious leaders had argued that Muslims in Christian territory would be subject to direct and indirect pressure, and preached emigration as a way to protect the religion from eroding. Ahmad al-Wansharis, the contemporary North African scholar and leading authority on Spanish Muslims, wrote in 1491 that emigrating from Christian to Muslim lands was compulsory in almost all circumstances. Further, he urged severe punishment for Muslims who remained and predicted that they would temporarily dwell in hell in the afterlife. However, the policy of the Christian authorities was generally to block such emigration. Consequently, this option was only practically doable for the wealthiest among those living near the southern coast, and even then with great difficulty. For example, in Sierra Bermeja, Granada in 1501, an option of exile was offered as an alternative to conversion only for those who paid a fee of ten gold doblas, which most citizens could not afford. In the same year, villagers of Turre and Teresa near Sierra Cabrera in Almeria fought the Christian militias with help from their North African rescuers at Moj√°car while leaving the region. The people of Turre were defeated and the planned escape turned into a massacre; the people of Teresa got away but their properties, except what could fit into their small boats, were left behind and confiscated. While the edict of conversion in Castile nominally allowed emigration, it explicitly forbade nearly all available destinations for the Muslim population of Castile, and consequently \\"virtually all\\" Muslims had to accept conversion. In Aragon, Muslims who wished to leave were required to go to Castile, take an inland route across the breadth of Castile through Madrid and Valladolid, and finally embark by sea on the northwest coast, all on a tight deadline. Religious studies scholar Brian A. Catlos said that emigration \\"was not a viable option\\"; historian of Spain L. P. Harvey called this prescribed route \\"insane\\" and \\"so difficult to achieve\\" that the option of exile was \\"in practice almost nonexistent\\", and Sephardic historian Maurice Kriegel agreed, saying that \\"in practical terms it was impossible for them to leave the peninsula\\". Nevertheless, a small number of Muslims escaped to France, and from there to North Africa. = Armed resistance = The conversion campaign of Cardinal Cisneros in Granada triggered the Rebellion of the Alpujarras (1499‚Äì1501). The revolt ended in royalist victories, and the defeated rebels were then required to convert. After the edict of conversion in Aragon, Muslims also took up arms, especially in the areas with defensible mountainous terrain. The first armed revolt took place at Benaguasil by Muslims from the town and surrounding areas. An initial royalist assault was repelled, but the town capitulated in March 1526 after a five-week siege, resulting in the rebels' baptism. A more serious rebellion developed in the Sierra de Espadan. The rebel leader called himself \\"Selim Almanzo\\", invoking Almanzor, a Muslim leader during the peak of power for Spanish Muslims. The Muslims held out for months and pushed back several assaults until the royalist army, enlarged to 7,000 men with a German contingent of 3,000 soldiers, finally made a successful assault on September 19, 1526. The assault ended in the massacring of 5,000 Muslims, including old men and women. Survivors of the massacre escaped to the Muela de Cortes; some of them later surrendered and were baptized, while others escaped to North Africa. = Sincere conversions = Some converts were sincerely devout in their Christian faith. Cisneros said that some converts chose to die as martyrs when demanded to recant by the Muslim rebels in Granada. A convert named Pedro de Mercado from the village of Ronda refused to join the rebellion in Granada; in response, the rebels burned his house and kidnapped members of his family, including his wife and a daughter. The crown later paid him compensation for his losses. In 1502, the whole Muslim community of Teruel (part of Aragon bordered with Castile) converted en masse to Christianity, even though the 1502 edict of conversion for Castilian Muslims did not apply to them. Harvey suggested that they were pressured by the Castilians across the border, but historian Trevor Dadson argued that this conversion was unforced, caused instead by centuries of contact with their Christian neighbors and a desire for an equal status with the Christians.

Prelude On 10 May 1966 following sightings of large People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) forces west of ƒê·ª©c C∆° and Plei Me Camps, the 3rd Brigade, 25th Infantry Division was deployed to Landing Zone Oasis to sweep the area to the southwest. After a week of fruitless searching the Brigade changed its focus to the west to the Chu Pong Massif. Operation On the morning of 24 May a CIDG patrol was ambushed by an estimated two battalions of PAVN 10 kilometres southwest of Plei Djereng Camp. The patrol was reinforced by a further two CIDG Companies and the fighting continued throughout the day with both sides digging in for the night. On the morning of 25 May, the PAVN attacked the CIDG positions and they withdrew in a running firefight towards Plei Djereng, losses were 18 Montagnards and 2 US Special Forces advisers. The PAVN then proceeded to mortar the camp killing a further 30 Montagnards and wounding 54. BG Glenn D. Walker ordered the 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry Regiment (2/35th Infantry) to relieve Plei Djereng and they operated south of the camp for the next 2 days. On 27 May the 2/35th Infantry moved 20 kilometres south of Plei Djereng to Landing Zone (LZ) Eleven Alfa and on 28 May Company B was landed by helicopter 10 kilometres west at LZ Ten Alfa. LZ Ten Alfa was a \\"hot\\" landing zone and after only 63 men had been landed it was closed to helicopters due to PAVN fire. The men of Company B beat off several PAVN attacks before supporting fire allowed the rest of the Company and Company A 1/35th Infantry to land. After midnight on 29 May the PAVN 66th Regiment launched an attack on LZ Ten Alfa while the PAVN 33rd Regiment attacked LZ Eleven Alfa, both attacks were repulsed and at dawn the Americans found 80 PAVN bodies around LZ Ten Alfa. As the Americans moved beyond the perimeter on LZ Ten Alfa they were met with PAVN fire and forced back into the LZ which was hit by mortar fire and the PAVN then assaulted again. This attack and another several hours later were both beaten back with total PAVN losses of 250 dead. The 3rd Brigade then searched south and west of LZ Ten Alfa for the next 8 days but were unable to locate the PAVN who had presumably withdrawn across the border into Cambodia. On 17 June BG Walker moved the focus of the operation back to the Chu Pong Massif. On 20 June the 2/35th Infantry's reconnaissance platoon, operating 10 kilometres north of the Chu Pong Massif pursued a group of PAVN soldiers and was pinned down by heavy fire and had to be rescued by the Battalion and Troop C 3rd Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment, US losses were 3 killed and 14 wounded. At 10:30 on 24 June the 1/35th Infantry's reconnaissance platoon came under fire near the Cambodian border, the platoon called in air and artillery support which forced the PAVN to withdraw. As the Americans advanced they ran into well entrenched PAVN positions and despite reinforcement by a further two companies and an armored cavalry troop the Americans were unable to penetrate the PAVN positions by nightfall when the PAVN slipped across the border. On 3 July a patrol by Company B 1/35th Infantry was ambushed near the Cambodian border. A platoon from Company B and the Brigade armored cavalry troop was sent to rescue the patrol and they succeeded in rescuing them and withdrawing to the north under cover of air and artillery strikes. US losses were 17 dead and 32 wounded, while 23 PAVN dead were found in the area the following day. At the end of July prisoner interrogation indicated that the PAVN 66th Regiment was located on the north of the Chu Pong Massif and that the PAVN 32nd Regiment was located 10 kilometres southwest of LZ Oasis. BG Walker's Brigade was reinforced by the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment (2/7th Cavalry) and the Republic of Korea Army 3rd Battalion, 1st Cavalry Regiment. While the 3rd Brigade and the Koreans deployed north and east of the Chu Pong Massif, on 31 July the 2/7th Cavalry was deployed by helicopter to LZ Orange 7 kilometres southwest of LZ Oasis. At dawn on 1 August the PAVN 32nd Regiment hit LZ Orange with mortar fire followed by 3 infantry assaults. The Americans called in air support and the PAVN withdrew to the northwest. The Americans lost 5 dead and 40 wounded, while a patrol found 28 PAVN dead. Aftermath Operation Paul Revere officially concluded at midnight on 31 July and was immediately succeeded by Operation Paul Revere II. Total US casualties were 66 killed, while the US had claimed that PAVN losses were 546 killed and a further 68 captured.

The Morse Building, designed by Benjamin Silliman Jr. and James M. Farnsworth, contains elements of the Victorian Gothic, Neo-Grec, and Rundbogenstil style. The Morse Building uses polychrome brickwork and terracotta cladding to highlight its fenestration. Its interior structure consists of a steel frame placed upon a foundation that descends to an underlying layer of sand. The Morse Building was developed by G. Livingston and Sidney E. Morse, nephews of telegraph inventor Samuel F. B. Morse and sons of the site's previous owners. It was constructed from June 1878 to March 1880 and was one of the tallest buildings in New York City when completed, standing at with ten stories. As completed, the building had 175 offices and modern amenities such as steam heat and gas lighting. Bannister & Schell altered the building significantly in 1901‚Äì1902 to an Edwardian Neo-Classical style, bringing the building to 14 stories and . Around 1965, the base was modified again and the balcony and cornice were removed. After a failed redevelopment attempt in the 1970s, it became a residential building in 1980, with 39 apartments. The building was designated a landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 2006. The Morse Building is also a contributing property to the Fulton‚ÄìNassau Historic District, a National Register of Historic Places district created in 2005.  Site  The Morse Building is in the Financial District of Manhattan, just east of New York City Hall, City Hall Park, and the Civic Center. It is bounded on the west by Nassau Street, on the south by Beekman Street, on the east by 8 Spruce Street, and on the north by 150 Nassau Street. 5 Beekman Street is diagonally across the intersection of Nassau and Beekman streets, while the Potter Building and 41 Park Row are directly across Nassau Street. The Morse Building occupies a plot measuring on Nassau Street and on Beekman Street.  Design  The Morse Building stands tall with 14 stories and is one of the oldest remaining fireproof skyscrapers in New York City. Benjamin Silliman Jr. and James M. Farnsworth designed the Morse Building's lowest eight stories, built between 1878 and 1880. The structure was the firm's first major project in New York City; the firm had designed the Morse Building as a 10-story structure, but the top two stories were subsequently rebuilt. The upper six stories were designed by William P. Bannister and Richard Montgomery Schell and built from 1901 and 1902. The building's original design was inspired by the Victorian Gothic, Neo-Grec, and Rundbogenstil styles. The Morse Building's corner location allowed it to have two full facades: the southern elevation on Beekman Street and the western elevation on Nassau Street. The design of the Morse Building contrasts with that of the Temple Court Building (now 5 Beekman Street) and Potter Building, from the same architects. Silliman and Farnsworth's choice of building materials was influenced by the then-recent \\"Great Fires\\" of Boston and Chicago. Brick and terracotta were used as a fireproof material. The terracotta was sourced from a Chicago firm while the brick was made by the Peerless Brick Company of Philadelphia. The project also involved Smith & Prodgers as plasterers, Morton & Chesley as carpenters, and Steward & Vanhorn as the decorators and painters. Numerous other contractors provided various materials for the building, including iron contractor Post & McCord. The 1901‚Äì1902 expansion employed Charles Ward Hall, the building's then-owner, as chief engineer, and Hall & Grant Construction as general contractor. The building was originally tall, making it one of New York City's tallest buildings upon its completion. According to a 1879 count, the former New York Tribune Building and Western Union Telegraph Building were the tallest at , excluding their ornamental clock towers. The completed building was said to be the tallest straight-walled building in the city, or even in the world. Taller structures, including the Tribune and Western Union buildings, had setbacks partway up their facades. The Morse Building was cited as the first structure to use raised vertical terracotta joints, which in turn were credited with preventing rain from washing out the mortar. It was also one of the first structures to use ornamental terracotta. = Facade = Southern facade, seen from the southwest corner of Nassau and Beekman Streets The current facade is divided into three horizontal sections: a two-story base, a six-story midsection from the original design, and a six-story upper section. The building's exterior walls are thick in the cellar and thick at the first floor, narrowing to at the eighth floor. The facade was initially divided into four horizontal sections: a two-story base; two midsections of three stories; and an upper section of one full story, one attic story, and a cornice with a parapet. The current first floor was originally a raised basement. Prominent vertical pilasters subdivide the facade into three segments on Nassau Street and two on Beekman Street; these were designed to emphasize the horizontal lines as much as possible, in order to temper the perceived excessive height of the building. There are five bays facing Nassau Street, divided by the pilasters into a 2-1-2 pattern, and four bays facing Beekman Street, divided by the pilasters into two groups of two. The eastern facade is bare and contains arched windows. During the reconstruction, the lowest of the facade was refaced with blocks of stone, while the rest of the original exterior was unchanged to a height of . The first floor contains four storefront openings each facing Nassau and Beekman Streets, as well as an entrance to the residential units in the center bay on Nassau Street. The second floor has five rectangular windows on Nassau Street and four facing Beekman Street. The third- through eighth-story windows are set in brick and terracotta. On the current third and sixth stories (and in the original eighth story), each bay has two semicircular arched windows, while on the fourth, fifth, seventh, and eighth stories, each bay has two flat-arched windows within a segmental arch. The segmental arches were evocative of those of the Tribune Building, and the red and black brick added emphasis to the facade. A fiberglass cornice runs above the eighth story. The ninth through thirteenth stories are set within brick. The pilasters from the lower stories continue upward, and each bay contains a single three-part window on each floor. A fiberglass cornice runs above the thirteenth story. There is a space between the tenth and eleventh story, between which was a balcony and cornice. The fourteenth story serves as an attic with another cornice above it. On the roof is an elevator room. = Foundation = At the bottom, the walls were offset to , where they rested on continuous concrete footings, each of which was thick. The walls exert a pressure of on the foundation, which descends to a layer of sand below curb level. The Morse Building's northern wall abuts 150 Nassau Street and was underpinned with brick and concrete during the construction of that building. The foundations of 150 Nassau Street descended to below ground level; the new footings installed during that project were only thick and were flush with the original wall. During the 1901‚Äì1902 expansion of the building, these footings were found to be insufficient to support the weight of the extra stories. A force of 12,000 pounds per square foot (578,200 Newtons per square meter) would have been exerted on these footings, causing unequal settlement. As a result, a trench was dug along the north wall below the sub-basement level. Four longitudinal distributing beams were installed, serving as grillages for short vertical center posts that rose to horizontal transverse girders; these transverse girders served as cantilevers, more evenly distributing the force placed on each footing. = Features = The floors were constructed of iron I-beams placed at intervals of and supported at both ends by brickwork. These beams were spanned by fireproof corrugated arches infilled with concrete. Two transverse partition walls, whose centers were apart, separate the building into three unequal sections from north to south. These partitions, along with the exterior walls, carry all of the iron beams. The partitions were also fireproof, since Smith & Prodgers covered them with laths of iron and layers of plaster. Post & McCord installed the iron beams in the frame with a steam derrick, marking the contractor's first use of that tool. The original building did not need to use any interior columns because its entire weight was supported on the exterior piers. When the upper six stories were constructed, the exterior walls were moved slightly and steel beams were installed to provide support for the frame. A \\"cap\\" of beams was installed above the eighth floor, from which these steel beams descended to the lower stories. On the upper stories, eighteen steel beams were installed on the outer walls and five interior columns were placed atop grillage beams. The wall girders were concealed by the projecting eighth-floor belt course. Originally, the building had an iron stairway with marble and slate treads at its center. There were also two hydraulic elevators made by Otis and a dumbwaiter for items. There were water tanks with of capacity. Fireplaces in each room connected to a steam-heating system, with a boiler and smokestack. The windows were glazed with plate glass while the hardware was made of bronze; the floors were made of wood. The original basement was below street level with a ceiling, and a flight of stairs connected to the original first story, which had a ceiling. During the 1901‚Äì1902 reconstruction, the lowest two floors were raised several feet, and a new staircase and three elevators made by the Portland Company were installed, replacing the old staircase and elevators. The original oil lamps and gas pipes were replaced with electric lighting and steam heating; the plumbing was replaced; and the boiler was brought to the top of the new roof. The Morse Building housed offices when it was completed, but in 1980, it was converted to 39 apartments with three units on each floor, ranging from in size. History = Construction = During the late 19th century, the surrounding area had grown into the city's \\"Newspaper Row\\". Several newspaper headquarters had been built on the adjacent Park Row, including the New York Times Building, the Potter Building, the Park Row Building, the New York Tribune Building, and the New York World Building. Meanwhile, printing was centered around Beekman Street. The previous building on the Morse Building's site was occupied by the religious newspaper The New- York Observer between 1840 and 1859. Richard Cary Morse and Sidney Edwards Morse were the Observer founders; they were the brothers of Samuel Morse, who had invented Morse code and the electrical telegraph, and had used one of the Observer building's rooms to experiment with his invention. Richard and Sidney had an ownership stake in the land by 1845. The Observer moved across Nassau Street to the Old Brick Church site (now 41 Park Row) in 1859. The building was also occupied by other newspapers, and after they moved out during the mid-19th century, Savery's Temperance House was formed in one section of the building. The Temperance House later became the Park Hotel, which was losing patronage by the 1870s because of bad management. In 1878, the Morse brothers transferred land ownership to their respective sons, Gilbert Livingston Morse and Sidney Edwards Morse Jr., who subsequently planned a speculative office building to replace the hotel. Plans for the demolition of the Park Hotel were announced in April, with work to commence the following month. Silliman and Farnsworth had been hired to design the speculative office building , containing banking quarters on the lower floors and offices on the upper floors. By June, work had started on the new building, to cost $175,000. The Real Estate Record and Guide noted in 1879 that the \\"immense pile of masonry far overtopping adjoining structures\\" had thousands of bystanders. At the time, the top three floors had already been rented. Construction was completed in March 1880, at an ultimate cost of $200,000. The original structure was when completed, and contained 175 offices. = Early use = 1893 view Upon the Morse Building's completion, office buildings were being erected in Lower Manhattan, as part of a development trend that had started after the Panic of 1873. The Real Estate Record and Guide stated in 1882 that the Tribune, Times, Morse, and Temple Court buildings were close to the courts of the Civic Center, making these buildings ideal for lawyers. When the old New York World building across Nassau Street burned in January 1882, the lower floors of the Morse Building suffered minor damage. Some of the decorative elements and windows were damaged, and one of the Morse cousins characterized the responding firefighters' actions as vandalism, blaming them for allowing part of the World building to fall onto the Morse Building. Nonetheless, in an 1883 article, the Morses said that they were receiving a 10% return on the building. The Morse Building was reportedly constantly occupied by merchants and lawyers during the late 19th century. The building contained the office and rooftop studio of the Vitagraph Company of America, which became the first motion-picture company in America; the company filmed Burglar on the Roof, their \\"first posed picture\\", at the building in 1897 or 1898. Other establishments such as the New York Canoe Club and the Multiple Speed and Traction Company were also housed in the Morse Building. Gilbert Livingston Morse died in 1891, and a mortgage in his half-interest was given to Matilda C. McVicker. The next year, Sidney Jr. sold Gilbert's share of the building to lawyer Nathaniel Niles, who purchased the building as an investment. In 1894, when a crack appeared in the facade during construction of the adjacent 150 Nassau Street, there were fears that the Morse Building was structurally unstable, though engineers said it was not serious. The American Tract Society, who was constructing 150 Nassau Street, was held liable for damages. Sidney Jr. sold his own share to Niles in 1895, though Sidney Jr. kept an office there until he died in 1908. The Washington Life Insurance Company started foreclosure proceedings against Niles in 1898 for failure to pay the mortgage. Early next year, the Morse Building was placed for sale at a foreclosure auction, and after a three-week adjournment of the auction, Washington Life Insurance bought the building for $601,000. In November 1900, Washington Life Insurance signed a contract with Charles Ward Hall to exchange the Morse Building with Hall's Hamilton Building at 125th Street and Park Avenue in East Harlem. At the time of the transaction, the buildings were worth $1.5 million in total. The property title was transferred the next month. Hall planned to rename the Morse Building to the Hall Building and remodel the interior, which included lowering the entrance to street level. The Morse Building instead became known as the Nassau‚ÄìBeekman Building, a move possibly inspired by the naming of 277 Broadway at Chambers Street as the Broadway‚ÄìChambers Building. The Nassau‚ÄìBeekman Building was already seen as \\"small and old-fashioned\\", especially when compared with the adjacent 23-story building at 150 Nassau Street, despite having been completed only twenty years prior. = Expansion = Bannister and Schell filed plans for the expansion in December 1900, at which point work was estimated to cost $150,000. Work started the following April. The expansion converted the former basement into a full story, increasing by one the floor number of all other stories. The lowest two stories were refaced in rusticated stone. The attic and the walls of the former eighth story were dismantled, and a temporary wooden roof and walls were built around the eighth story (which was slated to become the new ninth story). A new tenth story was built, and four additional brick-clad stories were erected to make the Nassau‚ÄìBeekman Building a fourteen-story building. A cornice with large scroll brackets was built above the tenth story, supporting a balcony. The architects had to work around existing tenants with minimal interruption in operations. For instance, foundation work had to be done in two phases since the cellar tenant could only make half of the cellar available at any given time. Elevator service was also maintained throughout the project, and so work on the new elevators was done one floor at a time. The project faced several legal issues. A cafe owner at the Morse Building's ground level unsuccessfully tried to file an injunction to stop construction after Hall built a temporary bridge in front of the cafe to protect pedestrians; this decision was affirmed by the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division. Another tenant refused to pay rent, claiming that he was being harassed due to construction, and Hall unsuccessfully tried to evict him. The project was completed by March 1902. = Later history = Seen from the ground Several incidents involving the building's elevators occurred after the building's expansion. An elevator dropped two stories in 1904, leaving its occupants unharmed, and two people died in the elevator shafts in separate accidents in 1905 and 1907. Another incident in 1910 involved an elevator cab dropping and injuring six people. In addition, the building was damaged in 1916 by a fire at a nearby low-rise building on Beekman Street. Metropolitan Life Insurance foreclosed on the Nassau‚ÄìBeekman Building in 1918 after Hall failed to pay the mortgage of $600,000. The next year, the building was sold to William E. Harmon; at the time, the building was valued at $1 million. Harmon's company, the United Cities Realty Corporation, renamed the building to the United Cities Realty Building. Ownership was later passed to Metropolitan Life in 1942; Nassau Offices Inc. in 1945; Peter I. Kenmore in 1951; and Clarendon Building Inc. in 1952. Around 1965, the base was remodeled in the neo-Classical style and the 10th-story cornice was removed, based on plans by John J. Tudda and Richard R. Scherer. Chatham Associates bought the property in 1968, a year after the Morse Building's tax lot was combined with an adjacent lot to the east. The New York World and Tribune buildings immediately to the north had been demolished in the 1950s and 1960s, and Pace College (later Pace University) built 1 Pace Plaza on the site of the latter. Pace also acquired the Morse Building and other nearby buildings in 1972, with plans to destroy them and build an office tower. These plans did not proceed and Pace University sold the Morse Building in 1979 to a joint venture composed of Martin Raynes and the East River Savings Bank. The building was converted the next year to a housing cooperative with 39 apartments. Minor modifications were made to the facade in 1995, with some pressed-metal elements being replaced with fiberglass. The pressed-metal cornice over the eighth floor was replaced around 2004 with a fiberglass cornice. Residents commenced an effort to give the Morse Building city landmark status in the 1990s, and the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the building as such on September 19, 2006. Additionally, on September 7, 2005, the Morse Building was designated as a contributing property to the Fulton‚ÄìNassau Historic District, a National Register of Historic Places district.  Critical reception  While Lower Manhattan's late-19th century skyscrapers generally received mixed reception, the building was mostly praised during its construction. American Architect and Building said in January 1879 that \\"the construction seems to have been carefully studied and well carried out\\". The same magazine said in July 1879 that \\"Many who watched the uprising walls wondered whether they would ever cease growing sky-wards\\", and applauded the building for exhibiting \\"contrast, diversity, and change\\". Another publication, The Manufacturer & Builder, said in June 1879 that the design was \\"decidedly agreeable in its general appearance as well as in its details\\". The Manufacturer and Builder mentioned the flat roof as a minor criticism, but that it was better than having a roof proportional to the building's height, which would be \\"extravagantly high\\" like the Tribune Building's \\"abominable roof\\". Upon the Morse Building's completion, several publications lauded the relatively simple design of the facade as well as the usage of brick and terracotta. Carpentry and Building magazine said, \\"Although there have been many tall buildings erected in New York of late years, this one outstrips them all\\". The Building News said that the Morse Building was \\"a very quiet and pleasing structure\\", rather than being gaudy. The Century Magazine stated in 1884 that the building's design was \\"not without evidence of effort in the right direction\\", especially when compared with nearby office structures, which were described as either \\"hideous\\" or \\"commonplace\\". Moses King, in his 1893 Handbook of New York, praised the use of brick and terracotta in the Morse Building, \\"a solid handsome structure\\". Architectural critic Montgomery Schuyler called the Morse Building among the \\"last\\" and \\"best\\" buildings in New York City designed in the Gothic Revival style, but that through the addition of four stories, the new owner was spending \\"good money in spoiling what it would have cost him no money at all to leave alone\\". Modern architectural critics also discussed the effect of the building's articulation on its overall appearance. In 2006, Christopher Gray of The New York Times said \\"the completed Morse Building looked like two or three warehouses stacked on top of one another.\\" Architecture writers Sarah Landau and Carl Condit said that the piers and articulation of the facade \\"imparted a quality of wholeness not typical of early skyscrapers.\\"  See also  * List of New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan below 14th Street References = Notes = = Citations = = Sources =  * * External links * Category:1880 establishments in New York (state) Category:Civic Center, Manhattan Category:Historic district contributing properties in Manhattan Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1880 Category:Edwardian architecture Category:Financial District, Manhattan Category:Gothic Revival architecture in New York City Category:Neoclassical architecture in New York City Category:New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan Category:Residential buildings completed in 1880 Category:Romanesque Revival architecture in New York City Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Manhattan ","title":"Morse Building"},{"id":"53540959","text":"Sasolburg Regiment was a light infantry regiment of the South African Army.

It formed part of the South African Army Infantry Formation as well as the South African Territorial Reserve. History =Origin= Oil was the one major raw material not available in South Africa except synthetically from coal. This priority resource was therefore placed under a high degree of control by the government, which expected to meet 50% of its oil needs from the SASOL program. The South African Coal Oil and Gas Corporation was a state controlled company. Three large plants were developed and eventually considered National Key Points. =The first industrial Commando= The SASOL Commando was formed from workers from the refinery to protect these installations as they were already trained in the safety protocols and how to handle the inherent dangers involved. These members had been originally part of the Heilbron Commando but were released on 14 February 1962 to form this first industrial commando.

It was founded by Dada Bhagwan and later spread to Maharashtra and Gujarati diaspora communities around the world. After death of Dada Bhagwan, the movement split in two factions: one led by Niruben Amin and the other led by Kanubhai Patel. The principal doctrine of the Akram Vignan movement is gnan bhakti which means devotional surrender (samarpan) to Simandhar Swami and his interlocutor Dada Bhagwan to gain knowledge of salvation. Fundamentals Statue of Simandhar Swami at Trimandir, the temple at Adalaj The Akram Vignan movement draws some principles from Jainism and teaches about two paths. Jains believe that liberation (Kevala jnana and moksha) is not possible in current times as no suitable condition for liberated being exists which is based on Jain cosmological assumption. This is believed in dominant Kramik or step-by-step path of Jainism. By contrast, Akramik or stepless path believes that the moksha can be achieved directly by grace (kripa) of Simandhar Swami, the present Jain Tirthankara who lives in mythical land of Mahavideha in Jain cosmology. The Akram Vignan movement claims to offer 'instant salvation' by a medium (nimitta) or interlocutor who directly connects to Simandhar Swami through magical means. The principal medium was A. M. Patel who was known as Dada Bhagwan who founded the movement. The principal doctrine of the Akram Vignan movement is jnan bhakti which means devotional surrender (samarpan) to Simandhar Swami and his interlocutor Dada Bhagwan to gain knowledge of salvation. In contrast to traditional Jainism, it rejects or is indifferent to scriptural knowledge, physical asceticism, rituals and practices in favour of self-knowledge (atma-jnan) through direct grace of Simandhar Swami and devotion to his medium (gurubhakti). Fl√ºgel regards the movement to be a form of Jain-Vaishnava syncretism, a development analogous to the Mahayana in Buddhism. History Followers of Akram Vignan Movement gathered on occasion of Guru Purnima at Trimandir temple, Adalaj near Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. July 2017. ;Early years The movement was founded by Ambalal Muljibhai Patel who had achieved self-realization in June 1958 as described in his discourses or conversations. He is known as Atmagnani or Dada Bhagwan by his followers though he had differentiated between self and his empirical self as Patel and Dada Bhagwan. Initially he had not revealed his experiences to public but some of his close relatives and friends knew it. In 1962, during conversation with him, a person named Chandrakant Patel from Uganda experienced sudden self- realization. Such experience is described in traditional Jainism as kshayaka samyatva which is only achieved in presence of Tirthankara. Kanubhai K. Patel was the second person, who was also his business partner, who received instant knowledge in 1963 from Dada Bhagwan. ;Expansion Between 1962 and 1968, very few close people received \\"knowledge\\" through Dada Bhagwan. Following 1968, he bestowed \\"knowledge\\" who requested to be blessed. This is the foundation of the movement. He said that he was initially reluctant due to fear of public opinion as in case of Shrimad Rajchandra but after his visit to a Rishabha temple in Khambhat he decided to public performance of Gyanvidhi, a practise to transfer of \\"knowledge\\" for self-realisation. In 1968, the first Gyanvidhi was held at Bombay (now Mumbai). Over the years, the Gyanvidhi became more elaborate and achieved its present form in 1983. He continued to give religious discourses. He emphasised contact of \\"knower\\" (jnani) to gain knowledge over scriptural or ritual knowledge. His followers were initially spread in his hometown Vadodara and Bombay. The movement expanded in 1960s and 1970s to southern Gujarat and Maharashtra and in Gujarati diaspora in East Africa, North America and UK. In 1983, he had reportedly around 50,000 followers. When he died in 1988, his funeral was attended by about 60000. In 1999, their magazine Akram Vignan claimed to have 3,00,000 followers. Jay Sachchidanand Sangh, the major organisation of Akram Vignan movement, was founded under the auspices of Dada Bhagwan in Mumbai. Khetsi Narsi Shah, a head of local Dada Bhagwan Vitarag Trust, was appointed as the first sanghpati, the community leader of it. He was succeeded by G. A. Shah of Ahmedabad. The organisation manages activities and movements of religious leader and his chief followers called Aptaputras and Aptaputris (celibate disciples who are invited around the world). It also manages community funds and supervises building activities along with publication of books and magazine, Akram Vignan (first published in 1979). Now the organisation is led by local sanghpatis in Ahmedabad, Surat, Mumbai, London and US. ;Successions Niruben Amin, a gynecologist was one of the followers of Dada Bhagwan. When Dada Bhagwan suffered from fractured leg and required constant medical attention, she joined him to serve him with her medical knowledge and continued to tour with him including his foreign visits from 1982 to 1987. During the same period, Kanubhai had continued to operate a company in which Dada Bhagwan was partner before he attained self realization. Soon after death of Dada Bhagwan, the movement split in two factions. One led by Kanubhai Patel and backed by Jay Sachchidannad Sangh and other led by Niruben Amin. Niruben claimed that she was instructed and trained in Gyanvidhi by Dada Bhagwan. Niruben formed her own organisations; first Dada Bhagwan Foundation Trust of Ajit Patel in Chennai and Ahmedabad, and later Simandhar Swami Aradhana Trust in Ahmedabad and Mahavideh Foundation in Mumbai. She became popular leader of movement and was addressed as Niruma by her followers from 1999. After death of Niruben in 2006, she was succeeded by Deepakbhai Desai. Kanubhai Patel, also known as Kanudada, was close to Dada Bhagwan before 1978. He claims succession and presents a recorded tape in which Dada Bhagwan had instructed about it (succession). He is seen as future Tirthankara by his many followers. His faction refers their teaching of Akram Vignan as Vitrag Vignan. Doctrines Niruben Amin organised the movement by publishing the discourses of Dada Bhagwan, formalising Gyanvidhi, construction of temples and composing ritual worship (puja). Niruben Amin had tape-recorded the discourses of Dada Bhagwan between 1974 and 1988 which amount to about 4000 tapes. These tapes are transcribed, compiled and published as Aptavani (Words of Truth). The fourteen volumes are published. The first one and half volume was compiled by Niruben Amin and Kanubhai Patel together. The first volume was published by Jay Sachchidanand Sangh in 1974. After 1983, almost all of volumes are based on tapes recorded by Amin. Other texts of Dada Bhagwan include Swarup Vignan, the collection of satsang notes by Natubhai Patel 'Vasudev', published in 1980s. These printed compilations are not used in any rituals as Dada Bhagwan refused to write religious texts. He only wrote two short ritual texts, Namaskar Vidhi (1971‚Äì73) and Nav Kalamo (1977). Namskar Vidhi is a devotional hymn which includes all beings worthy of worship; Panch Parmeshthi of Jain Namokar Mantra to Krishna to Dada Bhagwan himself in descending order. Nav Kalamo (Nine Precepts) is a prayer to Dada Bhagwan which is considered as 'the essence of all scriptures'. Tri-mantra (Three-fold mantra) is modified version of Jain Namokar Mantra which also includes respect to Jina, Krishna and Shiva which is used at the opening of every religious event. Nishchay-Vyavahar Charan Vidhi (Absolute-Relative Foot Worship) written by Vanubhai Patel in 1968 at the request of Dada Bhagwan and Amin is an important text used in daily worship as well as in Gyanvidhi. The opening chants of Gyanvidhi currently used were composed by Navneet Patel, a songwriter from Mumbai, in 1970. Niruben Amin has also composed an aarti dedicated to Simandhar Swami. Jay Sachchidanand Sangh, led by Kanubhai, published several books including volumes of Aptasutra and Aptavani (Vol. 1 to 9), Anubhav Gnan Sutras, Panch Agna Paramarth, poetry of Navneet Sanghvi. Temples Trimandir at Adalaj, Gujarat After initial reluctance, Dada Bhagwan agreed to build a temple, Trimandir, which included images of Simandhar Swami, Krishna and Shiva to present message of universal religion. In 1993, a temple and dharmashala (rest house) was constructed in Surat managed by the Mahavideh Tirthdham Trust. It had all three images and has a chamber underneath a temples which had photos of A. M. Patel (Dada Bhagwan) and Kanubhai Patel. It is managed by the Jay Sachchidanand Sangh. Mahavideh Tirthdham, a Trimandir was also built by Niruben Amin in Ahmedabad in 1999. More than 20 Trimandirs were built later by the Dada Bhagwan Foundation.

IfNotNow is an American Jewish progressive activist group opposing the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The IfNotNow movement consists of young Jewish Americans who demonstrate against politicians, US Government policies, and Jewish institutions perceived to support the occupation, primarily through direct action and media appearances. Founding  IfNotNow was founded in July 2014 to protest American Jewish institutional support for Israel's actions during the 2014 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict. The name IfNotNow is derived from a saying by the 1st century Jewish sage Hillel the Elder: \\"If I am not for myself, who will be for me? And being for myself, what am 'I'? If not now, when?\\" Their first action was to recite the Jewish prayer of mourning, the Mourner's Kaddish, for all Palestinian and Israeli victims of the war outside the offices of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.  Strategy  IfNotNow is a movement-based organization, designed to appeal directly to the public through social media and direct action; their refusal to participate in closed-door meetings has been criticized by leaders of established Jewish institutions. As part of the broader #JewishResistance coalition, IfNotNow has sought to highlight similarities and ties between the Trump administration and the administration of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

The tip of the labellum curls under and there are four to six rows of thick, crowded, reddish-black calli up to 2 mm long, along the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs from September to November. Taxonomy and naming This orchid was first formally described in 1984 by Robert Bates from a specimen collected on the Yorke Peninsula. He gave it the name Caladenia dilatata var. stricta and published the description in the Journal of the Native Orchid Society of South Australia but in 1987 raised the variety to species status. The specific epithet (stricta) is a Latin word meaning \\"draw together\\". Distribution and habitat The upright spider orchid occurs in the Little Desert and Big Desert areas of Victoria and in south-eastern areas of South Australia. It grows in mallee scrub and woodland. Conservation Caladenia stricta is classified as \\"vulnerable\\" in Victoria under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988.

His publishing record based on work purportedly made over 20 years consisting of more than 400 research papers came under scrutiny after an Australian geologist, John Talent, researched his claims and work for nearly nine years so as to make a clear case of fraud. The discovery of the fraud began with Talent and John Pickett, who visited a road cut site in Nepal where Gupta had reported prolific numbers of Devonian conodont fossils. They found no fossils at nearly all the twenty sites he had mentioned but they found one site which yielded a fossil of a Silurian age. They subsequently chanced on his use of the same image in two papers and initially considered the possibility of error by adding the wrong photograph. A more detailed examination showed them that Gupta had used illustrations of fossils that were similar to specimens collected near New York by George Jennings Hinde in 1879. They interviewed coauthors, talked to Gupta on several occasions and made a detailed accusation on the willful nature and scale of fraud after nine years of research. Gupta attempted to respond to the claims by noting the credentials of his coworkers. The case unravelled with several co-workers realizing that they had been misled and having assumed good faith with a colleague and overlooked obvious contradictions and paradoxical results arising from assuming that Gupta had collected the fossils where he claimed they had been found. A range of other malpractices were also reported including the reuse of specimens which were claimed from various locations, the use of a specimen that was found missing elsewhere and plagiarism of images. John Talent received death threats from Gupta. In an interview to ABC he went on record to note that a technician in Gupta's department who threatened to reveal details of the fraud was reportedly killed in hit-and-run accident. Talent reported that Gupta had offered money to hitmen to inflict injury on his enemies. The aged mother of one of the Indian co-authors of the report by Talent published by the Senckenberg Museum was hit in a road accident and was seriously injured and broke several ribs. A four-year enquiry was conducted and Gupta was suspended from the post of director of the Institute of Paleontology at the Panjab University in Chandigarh but was reinstated subsequently following a court order and retired \\"normally\\" with super-annuation benefits in 2002.

Early life  Susan Cox was born in Hagerstown, Maryland in 1807. She was the second wife of Isaac \\"Ike\\" Cox, a Canadian- American blacksmith, whom she married in 1847 in West Jefferson, Ohio. Her husband served as a member of the 83rd Illinois Infantry during the Civil War. In 1867, Cox and her husband moved to a farm in Johnson County, Nebraska. She had 12 children with him, and became mother to the three children he had from a previous marriage. Only four of her children survived to adulthood. She and her husband were Baptists.  Participation in the Civil War effort  Cox enlisted in October 1862, in Knox County, Illinois. She served with her husband in the 83rd Illinois Infantry Nurse Corps throughout her career as a Civil War Nurse, serving at Fort Henry, Fort Donelson, and Clarksville. Because Cox remained with the same regiment, and spent much of her time with them at Fort Donelson, her experiences weren't as varied as the stories of some Civil War nurses. Civil War nurses did much more than change bandages, tend wounds, and dispense medicine. They also passed out supplies, wrote letters for soldiers and read to them, cooked and served meals, and did laundry. At Fort Donelson, Cox witnessed daily fight with the enemy. This work exposed Cox to enemy fire and camp life difficulties as she cared for the ailing soldiers. Cox's husband was also part of the infantry; one day, as Cox was following her husband and his company up the Cumberland River, a skirmish broke out. Cox also witnessed a man publicly executed for desertion. After many challenging experiences, Cox's service ended June 1864.  After the war  After the war, Cox stayed at home as a housekeeper, according to an 1880 census.United States Census, 1880; https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:33SQ- GYB4-JPH?cc=1417683&wc;=QZ27-2CZ%3A1589408354%2C1589398337%2C1589395226%2C1589398303 She continued to receive pension for her services in the war.

He was an early pioneer and settler in Fort Edmonton and made contributions to its development from a fur trade post to a major city in Western Canada. Life John Walter was born in 1849 in Orkney, Scotland. As his family had some connection to Canada through the Hudson‚Äôs Bay Company, he signed a five-year contract as a York boat builder and carpenter with HBC and arrived at Fort Edmonton on December 24, 1870. During those five years Walter contributed to many early Edmonton buildings, including the McDougall Methodist Church. When his HBC contract ended, he settled in the south bank of the North Saskatchewan River which was outside the Fort and began his own boat building and ferry operation across the river. Walter continued to expand his business by opening a blacksmith and carriage shop in 1886, a small coal mine in 1887, and a sawmill in 1893, all in relation to the rapidly growing settlements of Edmonton and Strathcona. The location where he settled grew into a vibrant community known as Walterdale. In October 1886, John Walter married Annie Elizabeth Newby, an Englishwoman who came to Canada employed as a nanny. They had two sons, John William Walter (b. 1887) and Stanley Walter (b. 1890). Outside the business realm, John Walter was also an active participant in the local community affairs, serving as the Chairman of the first South Edmonton School Board, sitting on the first Strathcona Town Council, and contributing money for recreational facilities and hospitals. John Walter's business started to decline on June 7, 1907 when an accident occurred in his coal mine that killed 5 of his employees. As the railway expanded, the use of the river diminished. In 1913, his ferry service came to an end due to the opening of the High Level Bridge. With the collapse of the real estate boom and the dwindling demand for housing in 1913 his lumber mill also suffered significantly. In 1915, a great flood struck Edmonton, causing great damage and huge losses to his assets and the community of Walterdale. Never able to fully recover from these losses, John Walter died in Edmonton on December 25, 1920, after an operation for appendicitis. Legacy The neighbourhood on the south shore of the North Saskatchewan River where John Walter settled is named River Valley Walterdale. The hill on its south overlooking the valley is called Walterdale Hill, and a nearby bridge spanning the river is called Walterdale Bridge. The three houses that John Walter had constructed as his residence are still standing, which are now part of the John Walter Museum, owned and operated by the Edmonton City Council since 1959. File:John walter house 1.jpgJohn Walter's first house was built in 1876 on the south side of the river. It is the oldest personal residence still standing in Edmonton. File:John walter house 2.jpgThe second house was built in 1884 in order to separate business from home. This is where John Walter started his wedded life. File:John walter house 3.jpgThe third house was constructed between 1899 and 1901. At the time of its completion it was one of the largest homes in Edmonton, equipped with running water, electricity, boiler heater, and a telephone.

Anna, the lead character of the novel, finds herself in a situation where she is made to ponder on the differences between her native Caribbean, where her parents live, and her adopted lifestyle in Manhattan, and how race affects it. The novel was longlisted for the 2011 International Dublin Literary Award.  Plot  Anna Sinclair is an established and in- demand book editor settled in Manhattan. On a vacation trip getting away from her work pressures, she visits her parents in her native Caribbean island. The Sinclairs are a well-known Black family in a White dominated island. On her visit, Anna finds out that her mother, Beatrice, is suffering with breast cancer and is at an advanced stage. She is appalled by the fact that her father, John, is aware of the illness but the couple have opted not to seek any serious medical help. Anna tries to persuade them to fly to the United States with her, where treatment would be made available including surgery to remove the large tumor. Beatrice is of the opinion that she would only get second grade service over there due to her color. Beatrice's opinion puts Anna in a dilemma and makes her think of the differences in the two worlds in which she and her parents live. She thinks of how race plays a vital role in their lives. Anna is happy to know that despite the grave situation, her parents stick together in thick and thin, whereas her own marriage has ended in divorce.  Publication and development  Nunez at the 2008 Brooklyn Book Festival Anna In-Between was published in 2009 by Akashic Books. The 2003 novel The In-Between World of Vikram Lall by M. G. Vassanji and published by Doubleday Canada narrates a story of Vikram Lall in the colonial and post- colonial Kenya. Nunez, who grew up in Trinidad and later moved to the United States notes on how she relates with the story of Vikram Lall of being straddled in the two different worlds. When Nunez wrote her novel Anna In- Between and portrayed Anna, a character struggling in two identities, she said \\"[she] just stole Vassanji's line, 'in-between'\\". The novel was long-listed for the 2011 International Dublin Literary Award where Let the Great World Spin by Irish author Colum McCann eventually won. It was awarded at the 2010 PEN Oakland/Josephine Miles Literary Award for literary excellence.  Reception and reviews  The novel received a starred review from Publishers Weekly and appreciated it for \\"[the] expressive prose and convincing characters that immediately hook the reader\\" and for handling family conflicts and immigration identity vividly. Author Ishmael Reed called it Nunez's best work and noted that \\"as long as she writes her magnificent books, characters like the Sinclairs, characters with depth and integrity, will not be hidden from us\\". Poet Lorna Goodison notes that the novel will \\"affect the way in which many readers now view the Caribbean\\". The World Affairs Journals editor, Amy Finnerty, reviews the novel as \\"a psychologically and emotionally astute family portrait, with dark themes like racism, cancer and the bittersweet longing of the immigrant\\". Arlene M. Roberts of The Huffington Post notes that the novel \\"is a woman's journey through the maze of the publishing industry which can often be unwelcoming to different perspectives, an establishment where decision makers 'refuse to find themselves in black characters'.\\"  References  Category:2009 American novels ","title":"Anna In-Between"},{"id":"53541363","text":"Donus is a genus of true weevils in the tribe Hyperini.

History Robb was born in Lislaird near Castlederg, County Tyrone, Ireland, to Arthur Robb and his wife Sarah Robb, n√©e Bird. In 1854 Robb and two brothers Robert (aged 18) and Samuel (aged 15) left for Australia aboard Fitzjames, arriving at Melbourne in October 1854. He joined the rush to the goldfields, teamed up with fellow Fitzjames passenger Thomas Stranger carting stone, then formed a partnership Overend & Robb with Best Overend (c. 1833 ‚Äì 30 November 1877) as contractors. Thomas Stranger, whose sister Elizabeth he later married, was with them from the outset and served as their supervising engineer to at least 1888. Around 1860 Overend & Robb won a contract to demolish Batman's Hill to make way for the projected Spencer Street railway station. Later projects of Overend & Robb were the Sunbury Industrial Schools and sewerage and water supply works at Coleraine and Yan Yean in Victoria. He won contracts to build railway lines in Victoria: *1874 Wangaratta to Beechworth *The first section of the Geelong to Colac railway, including the tunnel *Morwell to Mirboo *Murtoa to Warracknabeal *Ararat to Hamilton and Hamilton to Portland He built railways in other States: South Australia, Western Australia, Queensland and Tasmania. *1868 Launceston and Western Railway in Tasmania (Launceston and Deloraine railway). *1877 line from Kapunda, South Australia to the North West Bend, Murray River. It was while engaged on this project that Overend died, perhaps of heatstroke. *Narracan Valley line *Cairns railway in Queensland, whose costs exceeded ¬£50,000, and the subject of considerable litigation. Robb was also involved in water reticulation and sewerage projects in Victoria and South Australia, and the screwpile jetty and breakwater at Victor Harbor, South Australia, at the time heralded as an engineering marvel. His last project was a section of the Cairns-to-Kuranda railway line in far North Queensland between Kamerunga & Myola, which involved a steep climb up the Barron Gorge. Robb‚Äôs 1887 tender of ¬£290,094 was accepted, but proved inadequate for the work and expense involved, and though he was awarded another ¬£20,000 after a lengthy legal battle, he lost substantially on the project. He was in 1894 found to be insolvent. The completion of the project is commemorated by a cairn at Kuranda. Robb was a strong man who barely had a day's illness in his life, and died suddenly of apoplexy. His remains were buried in the Melbourne Cemetery. Other interests *He was partner with Arthur Blackwood in Talawanta Station, near the Queensland border *He had large sugar plantations on the Tweed River, New South Wales *He had interests in mines of Ballarat, Rutherglen, and the tin-fields of Tasmania *He was a major shareholder and founding director of the South Australian Brewing Company *He was largely responsible for the building of the Wesleyan Church, Toorak *He was associated with the Presbyterian Church *He was a founding director of the Federal Bank in 1881 *He built the Royal Exchange on King William Street, Adelaide in 1888, as a private speculation.

It is related to the Naples and Toscana viruses, which also cause sandfly fever.  Discovery  The virus was discovered in Palermo, Sicilia, Italy where it affected troops of the World War II Allied Army Forces after the 1943 Sicily landings.  Clinical  Sandfly fever is a nonfatal influenza-like illness. The incubation period is 3‚Äì6 days, and signs and symptoms include high fever that lasts 3‚Äì74 hours, malaise, abdominal pain, headache, severe retro-orbital pain, lower back pain, photophobia, and anorexia. Marked leukopenia may occur. Patients may also experience transient diarrhea or constipation with abdominal discomfort. The only sandfly fever virus known to be neurotropic is Toscana virus. However, there have been a report of encephalitis and aseptic meningitis associated with SFSV. Treatment is supportive but ribavirin may be beneficial in severe or rapidly decompensating cases. There is little or no serologic cross-reactivity between sandfly fever viruses. Infection can be confirmed through serologic IgM testing.  Epidemiology  The virus is found in the Mediterranean, Middle East, and parts of central and southern Asia, such as Italy, Egypt, Pakistan, Iran, Cyprus, Algeria, and Turkey. The peak incidence occurs in warm months, especially August, when the Phlebotomus papatasi sandfly vectors, which transmit the virus during blood feeding, are most active. One study has suggested that living near wastewater treatment facilities and the presence of livestock inside the home are risk factors for infection.

The Viet Cong, primarily armed with RPG-2, recoilless rifles and small-arms had engaged and destroyed some vehicles in a convoy but were prevented from overwhelming the convoy through a massive response of US armoured, artillery and aerial support. Much of the attacking ambush had slipped past the aerial and armoured cordon set-up. Background The commander of the 1st Infantry Division, General William E. DePuy tasked Col Sidney Berry with luring the Viet Cong to attack an apparently vulnerable US supply convoy and then ambushing and destroying the Viet Cong. Based on signals intelligence that indicated the presence of a Viet Cong Regiment in the area, Col Berry chose the Minh Thanh Road/Route 245, which branched off Highway 13 as the best site for the operation. A convoy of bulldozers and supply vehicles with a light armored cavalry escort would be sent from An L·ªôc to Minh Thanh, ostensibly to repair the Minh Thanh airfield. On 7 July two artillery firebases were established, Firebase 1 was established 6 kilometres southwest of An L·ªôc and west of Highway 13 with a mixed battery of artillery and Firebase 2 was established 8 kilometres south of An L·ªôc and east of Highway 13 with a battery of 105mm guns. The 2nd Battalion, 2nd Infantry Regiment (2/2nd Infantry) was deployed to Minh Thanh joining the 1st Battalion, 18th Infantry Regiment (1/18th Infantry). On 8 July the 1st Battalion, 28th Infantry Regiment (1/28th Infantry) deployed 2.5 kilometres east of Firebase 1 and the 1st Battalion, 16th Infantry Regiment was deployed at Qu·∫ßn L·ª£i Base Camp. Col. Berry then informed the local Province Chief and his staff of the planned convoy movement. A member of the staff was a suspected Viet Cong informant. Battle At 07:00 on 9 July the convoy, designated Task Force Dragoon, comprising Company B, 1/2nd Infantry and Troops B and C 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment left An L·ªôc. As the convoy moved onto the Minh Thanh Road air and artillery strikes hit likely ambush sites. At 11:00 the lead units from Troop C detected an L-shaped ambush along the road. At 11:10 the Viet Cong launched their ambush attacking Troop C's 1st Platoon with automatic weapons, mortar and recoilless rifle fire. The tanks and M113s deployed to direct fire against the Viet Cong attack, while air, artillery and gunship strikes soon followed. Two platoons of Troop B were moved forward to support Troop C and engage the main body of the Viet Cong on the north of the road. By 12:30 the Viet Cong were beginning to withdraw and the 2/2nd Infantry and 1/18th Infantry were deployed to the north in an attempt to block their escape. Most of the attacking forces had escaped the cordon nevertheless. At 13:30 aerial reconnaissance saw a large Viet Cong force regrouping northwest of the ambush site and 1/28th Infantry was deployed by helicopter to engage them. A two hour long moving firefight took place before the Viet Cong withdrew and 1/28th Infantry swept the area before setting up a night defensive position north of the Minh Thanh Road. At 16:00 the 1/18th Infantry located a small Viet Cong unit and following an artillery strike overran their position, allegedly killing 12 Viet Cong. Most of the Viet Cong attacking force escaped the cordon despite an overwhelming deployment of US forces attempting to encircle them, as slow-moving infantry sweeps did not catch up to them. Aftermath The Battle of Minh Thanh Road was considered a US victory as it showed US forces responding to an effective ambush. Total US casualties were 25 killed and 113 wounded, while initial reports claim Viet Cong losses were 238 killed (body count) and a further 300 were believed to have been killed, but the bodies were removed. Captured North Vietnamese documents acknowledged that the 272nd Regiment had \\"suffered heavy losses\\" due to its \\"unsatisfactory organization of its withdrawal from the battlefield\\". A total of 44 weapons were recovered, and 13 crew-served weapons were found.http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/387606.pdf A combination of massive aerial, artillery and armoured responses held off a lightly-equipped attacking group, demonstrating the considerably asymmetry of the battle. A post-war assessment of the battle from PAVN sources listed 128 killed and 167 wounded.

It has a single erect, hairy leaf and up to three pale greenish-yellow and white flowers and is only known from a small area near the Harvey Estuary.labellum detail Description Caladenia swartsiorum is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and which sometimes grows in small clumps. It has a single erect leaf, 200‚Äì230 mm long, 6‚Äì13 mm wide and pale green with reddish-purple blotches. Up to three pale greenish-yellow and white flowers 80-100 across are borne on a stalk 300‚Äì350 mm high. The sepals and petals suddenly narrow about one-third along to a brownish-black, densely glandular tip. The dorsal sepal is erect, then slightly curved forward, 50‚Äì80 mm long and 2‚Äì3 mm wide. The lateral sepals are 50‚Äì90 mm long, 3‚Äì4 mm wide and spread horizontally near the base, then curve downwards with a drooping tip. The petals are 50‚Äì70 mm long and 3‚Äì4 mm wide and arranged like the lateral sepals. The labellum is 16‚Äì21 mm long, 18‚Äì21 mm wide and white to pale yellow with red lines and spots. The sides of the labellum have linear, forward- facing, red and white teeth, decreasing in length towards the tip of the labellum which is curled under. There are four rows of red, anvil-shaped calli up to 1.5 mm long, along its centre. Flowering occurs from late September to October. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia swartsiorum was first described in 2015 by Andrew Phillip Brown and Garry Brockman from a specimen collected south of Mandurah and the description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (swartsiorum) honours Eric and Nigel Swarts who brought the orchid to the attention of Brown and Brockman. Distribution and habitat The Island Point spider orchid is only known from a small area near Mandurah in the Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic region where it grows in woodland on the verge of winter-wet areas. Conservation Caladenia swartsiorum is classified as \\"Priority One\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is known from only one or a few locations which are potentially at risk.
