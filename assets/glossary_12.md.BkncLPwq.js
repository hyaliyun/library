It is mentioned by Pliny the Elder in his Natural History as lying on the Menoba River (Guadiamar) near the towns of Laelia and Olontigi. He mentions it again as a town in the Celtic region, whose boundaries are not clear, but may extend from M√°laga to the Guadiana. Its exact location has been debated by historians since the 19th century. The following sites have been proposed, in chronological order: *Zahara de la Sierra, in the Sierra de Grazalema, Province of C√°diz; proposed by Rodrigo Caro, on the basis of Pliny's second mention of the town in the same list as Arunda (Ronda), Acinipo, etc. However, the same list includes Aruci and Turobriga, near Portugal. *Castuera, Badajoz; proposed by Miguel Cort√©s y L√≥pez, on the basis of Pliny's second list, despite its broad range. *On the Guadiamar, near Aznalc√≥llar; proposed by Antonio Delgado, who suggested downstream sites for Laelia (Cortijo de la Pisana or Pizana) and Olontigi (Aznalc√°zar). *The coast of Huelva; proposed by Francisco Mateos Gago. *Dehesa de Cresp√≠n (or Crisp√≠n), west of the confluence of the Agrio and Guadiamar rivers, between Aznalc√≥llar and Olivares; proposed by historian Juan Cuveiro Pi√±ol, on the basis of Pliny's first mention of the Menoba river. *Cerro de la Cabeza, near Olivares, proposed by numismatic researcher Leandre Villaronga, but this site most likely corresponds to Laelia. *Los Merineros, near Aznalc√≥llar; the latest proposal. The idea that Pliny might have referred to two towns with the same name is generally rejected. Numismatic evidence places Lastigi near Laelia and Olontigi and rejects the hypotheses of Zahara and Castuera. The ore-rich area around Aznalc√≥llar and the navigability of the Guadiamar support the notion that these cities lie in this region along the river.

Their origins were obscure with different accounts claiming or proposing Tanukhid or Ma'nid ancestry. From at least the early 17th century they were the traditional leaders of the Yaman faction among the Druzes, which stood in opposition to the Qays, led by the Tanukhid Buhturs, traditional chiefs of the Gharb area south of Beirut, and the Ma'ns. A likely chief of the family, Muzaffar al- Andari, led the Druze opposition to the powerful Ma'nid leader Fakhr al-Din II until reconciling with him in 1623. The Alam al-Dins' first definitive appearance in the historical record was in 1633 under their chief Ali, who was appointed by the Ottomans to replace Fakhr al-Din as the tax farmer and paramount chief of the Druze districts. Ali soon after exterminated the Ma'ns' Buhturid allies. Although he lost control of the Chouf district to the Ma'ns in 1636, Ali retained control of the remaining Druze districts of the Gharb, Jurd and Matn until his death in 1660. He was succeeded by his sons Muhammad and Mansur, who lost the districts to the Ma'ns under Fakhr al-Din's grandnephew Ahmad in 1667. The family retired to Damascus or the Hauran and, under Muhammad's son Musa, unsuccessfully attempted to recapture the chieftainship of the Mount Lebanon Druze in 1693, 1698 and 1711. On the last occasion, they were defeated and killed by the Shihabs and the Qays at the Battle of Ain Dara. Before the end of the 18th century, surviving members of the family relocated to Baaqlin in the Chouf, while others settled in Hasbaya in Wadi al-Taym and Suwayda in the Hauran. Origins The origins of the Alam al-Din family are uncertain. The historian Kamal Salibi proposed that the family was possibly descended from Alam al-Din Sulayman, one of a number of chiefs of the Druze Ma'n dynasty mentioned by the local Druze chronicler Ibn Sibat (d. 1521) as a chieftain of the Chouf in 1518; the other Ma'nid chief was Qurqumaz ibn Yunis, the ancestor of Fakhr al-Din II. Salibi argued that the omission of Alam al-Din Sulayman from later local histories, namely the works of Ahmad al-Khalidi (d. 1624) and Istifan al-Duwayhi (d. 1704) was due to their close association with the Ma'nid descendants of Qurqumaz. The 19th- century local histories of Haydar al-Shihabi and Tannus al-Shidyaq, respectively a member and an agent of the Ma'n's marital relatives and successors, the Shihab dynasty, may have had a similar interest in omitting the Alam al-Dins' possible Ma'nid origins. The Alam al-Dins posed a serious challenge to the Shihabs' paramount leadership of the Druze in Mount Lebanon until the demise of the Alam al-Dins in 1711. Shidyaq traced the origins of the Alam al-Dins to a certain 14th-century Tanukhid chieftain of the village of Ramtun in the Gharb, Alam al-Din Sulayman ibn Ghallab, who is mentioned by the Buhturid chronicler Salih ibn Yahya (d. 1435). Althouh Shidyaq's version was accepted by the historians Henri Lammens and Philip K. Hitti, Salibi considered it \\"confused and entirely unconvincing ... pure fancy\\". Research by Alexander Hourani, based on the Sijill al-Arslani (genealogical records of the Arslan family of Choueifat), holds that the Alam al-Dins were descendants of Alam al-Din Ma'n ibn Mu'attib, a descendant of the Abd Allah ibn al-Nu'man ibn Malik branch of the Tanukh confederation; the Arslans are purported descendants of Raslan ibn Malik, the uncle of Abd Allah ibn al-Nu'man. The Sijill al-Arslani dates the arrival of the Alam al-Din and Arslan families in Mount Lebanon to the late 8th century. The Alam al-Dins had marital ties with the Arslans, as well as the Buhturids, which was also a Tanukhid family. The historian William Harris considers Salibi's theory of Ma'nid ancestry of the Alam al-Dins to be without evidence. He notes that the Alam al-Din's likely Tanukhid ancestry gave them enough traditional authority to claim rights of chieftainship over the Druze. =Muzaffar al-Andari of the Jurd= The Alam al-Dins moved from Ramtun to Ain Dara in the Jurd in the 16th century. A certain Druze muqaddam (local chieftain) \\"Alam al-Din\\" of the Matn, a Druze district bordering the Jurd to the north, is mentioned in Ottoman documents as having surrendered his muskets and defected to the Ottomans during their 1585 expedition against Qurqumaz Ma'n and his Druze warriors. The preeminent chieftain of the Jurd in the early 17th century, Shaykh Muzaffar al-Andari, was likely a member of the Alam al-Din. Hourani notes that he was \\"apparently identical\\" to the Muzaffar ibn Salah al-Din Yusuf ibn Zahr al-Din Husayn ibn Nur al-Din Ishaq Alam al-Din mentioned in the Sijill al-Arslani as the brother-in-law of an Arslan chief. Muzaffar was among the early Druze opponents of the governor of Sidon-Beirut and Safad, the powerful Ma'nid chief Fakhr al-Din. He provided key military assistance to the army of the governor of Damascus, Hafiz Ahmed Pasha, and the Sayfas during their invasion of the Ma'n-dominated Chouf in 1613. Muzaffar and Husayn Sayfa burned and looted several villages in the Chouf, but were stopped by Hafiz Ahmed Pasha from completing the burning of the Ma'nid seat of Deir al-Qamar. Fakhr al-Din fled to Europe on that occasion, remaining there for the next five years. In that year Muzaffar was transferred the tax farms of the Jurd, Keserwan, Matn, Gharb and Shahhar districts, all of which were held previously by Fakhr al-Din or his proxies. He held onto the tax farms in 1614. According to Salibi, Shaykh Muzaffar led the Yaman faction, composed of the Arslans under Muhammad ibn Jamal al-Din and the Druze Sawwaf family chiefs of Shbaniyya in the Matn. The Yaman stood in opposition to the Qays led by the Buhturs and the Ma'ns. The Ma'n regained the good graces of the Ottomans by 1616 and used the momentum to confront their Druze rivals. Muzaffar, the Sawwafs and the son of Muhammad ibn Jamal al-Din, backed by the Sayfas, were routed by the Ma'n led by Fakhr al- Din's son Ali and brother Yunis in four August engagements at Naimeh near Beirut, Abeih in the Gharb, and Ighmid and Ain Dara, both in the Jurd. Fakhr al-Din returned in 1618 and launched an offensive against the Sayfas, with whom Muzaffar has taken refuge after the 1616 defeats. He was holed up in the Krak des Chevaliers with Yusuf Sayfa when Fakhr al-Din besieged the fortress in 1619. Muzaffar reconciled with Fakhr al-Din in December 1619/January 1620 and was appointed by him his subordinate chieftain in the Jurd. Fakhr al-Din's reasoning for reinstating Muzaffar in the Jurd was because Muzaffar \\"was originally from there and his ancestors had long been its governors\\", according to Khalidi. He joined Fakhr al-Din's coalition in the major Battle of Anjar in 1623, in which the governor of Damascus was routed and captured. Paramount chiefs of the Druze =Chieftainship of Ali= The first mention of Ali Alam al-Din in the sources was by Duwayhi in 1633. Duwayhi notes Ali was the leader of the Yaman faction of the Druze (opponents of the Qays faction headed by the Tanukh and Ma'n families). In that year he was appointed by the Ottomans to replace Fakhr al-Din of the Ma'n as the multazim (tax farmer) of the Druze Mountain, i.e. the predominantly Druze districts of the Chouf, Gharb, Jurd and Matn in southern Mount Lebanon. Fakhr al-Din had been captured in an Ottoman military expedition and imprisoned in Constantinople. Ali proceeded soon after to kill Fakhr al-Din's allies, the Tanukh chiefs of Abeih in the Gharb, Yahya al-Aqil, Sayf al-Din, Nasir al-Din and Mahmud, and their three young children, thereby eliminating the Tanukh family. They were replaced as the leaders of the Qays Druze by Fakhr al-Din's nephew Mulhim Ma'n, who led the opposition to Ali and the Yaman. In 1635 Ali and his Druze ally Zayn al-Din Sawwaf supported Ali Sayfa in his struggle to gain control of Tripoli from his uncle Assaf Sayfa in 1635. After initial successes, which saw Ali Sayfa regain control of Tripoli city, Byblos and Batroun, the allies fought a bloody stalemate against Assaf before being expelled from the Tripoli Eyalet in 1636. Assaf and the Janissaries of Damascus launched an offensive later that year against Ali for backing Ali Sayfa and failing to remit owed taxes from his Mount Lebanon tax farms. Ali and Ali Sayfa were then driven out of southern Mount Lebanon by the Qaysi Druze and holed themselves up in the Arqa fortress near Tripoli. There they were defeated again by Assaf and the Damascene Janissaries. However, after their defeat Ali Sayfa and Assaf reconciled under mediation by the Al Fadl tribe and the two Sayfas subsequently escorted Ali back to Beirut to resume his leadership position. By 1636 Mulhim had gained control of the Chouf, though Ali retained his chieftainship over the Gharb, Jurd and Matn. Ali continued to control these districts at the time of Mulhim's death in 1658, by which time Mulhim's tax farms had expanded to the Safad Sanjak (e.g. the Galilee and Jabal Amil) and Batroun. Mulhim was succeeded in his tax farms and leadership of the Qays by his son Ahmad. =Chieftainship of Muhammad= Ali died in 1660 and was succeeded by his sons Muhammad and Mansur. The former became the paramount chief of the Druze-dominated southern Mount Lebanon in 1662. The following year Mansur defeated a Qaysi Druze force at Adma. In 1667 Ahmad Ma'n defeated the Alam al-Dins in a battle outside of Beirut and took over their domains across the Druze districts and Keserwan. After their 1667 defeat the Alam al- Din chiefs resettled in Damascus and became politically inactive in Mount Lebanon. In 1669‚Äì1671 Muhammad held the tax farm for the village of Hubran near modern Suwayda in the Hauran, according to Ottoman tax records. Druze oral tradition in the Hauran recorded in the 20th century holds that the Alam al-Din chiefs led two hundred men and their families from Mount Lebanon to settle the Hauran in 1685, the first major wave of Druze migration to the area. =Attempts to return and demise under Musa= According to the history of Duwayhi, in 1693 a son of Muhammad, Musa, successfully petitioned the Sublime Porte (imperial Ottoman government) in Constantinople for a commission to evict and replace Ahmad Ma'n. With Ottoman backing, he forced Ahmad out of Deir al-Qamar, but shortly after he withdrew to Damascus and Ahmad was restored to his seat. Firmans from the Porte dated June 1694 and May 1695 appointed \\"the prominent emir, Musa Alam al-Din\\" to replace Ahmad in the latter's tax farms. In June 1695 another firman noted that Musa fled his Mount Lebanon districts while he was collecting taxes due to attacks by the Ma'ns and the Ma'ns' non-Druze marital relatives, the Shihabs of Wadi al-Taym. The firman orders the governor of Sidon Eyalet to restore Musa to his position and suppress the Ma'ns and Shihabs. Ahmad died in 1698 without male progeny. His chieftainship was inherited by his non-Druze marital relatives, the Shihabs of Wadi al-Taym. At Ahmad's death Musa again attempted to replace his successor, Bashir Shihab I, by order of the Sublime Porte, but the Ottomans denied his request. The Yamani Druze of Mount Lebanon led by Mahmoud Abi Harmoush of Samqaniyeh revolted against Bashir's successor and cousin, Haydar Shihab, in 1709‚Äì1711. Under Abi Harmoush's auspices Musa returned to Mount Lebanon with his kinsmen and supporters to lead the revolt and attempt to take over the paramount chieftainship of the Mount Lebanon Druze. The Shihabs and their Qaysi supporters routed the Alam al-Dins and the Yaman in the Battle of Ain Dara in 1711, which ended with the deaths of Musa and six other Alam al-Din chiefs. Their defeat precipitated a mass migration of Yamani Druze to the Hauran. There, the Alam al-Dins were succeeded as the chiefs of the Druze by their associates, the Hamdan family. Although the general consensus among historians is that the family was exterminated in the Battle of Ain Dara, Sami Swayd's Historical Dictionary of the Druzes holds that surviving members of the Alam al-Din fled to Baaqlin in the Chouf, and a number of them relocated from there to Hasbaya in Wadi al-Taym. By the end of the 18th century, part of the Alam al-Dins moved to Suwayda. Swayd's dictionary holds that in the present day members of the family also live in Jordan, Europe, Australia and the Americas.

Aristotle depicted. Philip of Tripoli, sometimes Philippus Tripolitanus or Philip of Foligno (fl. 1218‚Äì1269), was an Italian Catholic priest and translator. Although he had a markedly successful clerical career, his most enduring legacy is his translation of the complete Pseudo- Aristotelian Secretum secretorum from Arabic into Latin around 1230. Little is known of Philip's origins and early life. He seems to have received a good education, specializing in law. His career was divided between various appointments in the Holy Land, where he spent most of the late 1220s and late 1250s, and service to the Papacy. He was a papal subdeacon by 1225, when he left for the east to hold the castle and fief of Cursat. In 1227 he was made a canon of Tripoli and in 1238 of Byblos. In 1238 he served as apostolic legate in Frankish Greece. In 1248 he exchanged his canonry in Byblos for another in Tyre and added an archdeaconry in Sidon to his portfolio. Philip won a disputed electiopn to the archdiocese of Tyre during the vacancy of 1244‚Äì1250, but declined to accept it. He took up a cantorship at Tyre in 1250 instead. In 1251 he was made a papal chaplain, an office he held until his death. In 1266‚Äì1267 he was deputy apostolic legate in the Kingdom of Sicily. In 1267 he accepted an archdeaconry at Tripoli. He served the cardinals during the papal election of 1268‚Äì1271, being appointed an auditor general in 1269. He died not long after. Life =Education and early postings= Philip was probably born between about 1195 and 1200 in Umbria. One document refers to him as a \\"clerk of Foligno\\". His uncle Rainier, who was from the county of Todi, served as Latin patriarch of Antioch from 1219 until 1225. Philip received a prebend in Trent in 1218, at which point he would have to have been at least 22 years old unless granted a papal dispensation. Between about 1222 and 1225, he was in Antioch. By at the latest 1225, he had become a papal subdeacon, probably working in the papal chancery. Something of Philip's education can be inferred from papal documents and his translation. In papal documents, he is regularly referred to as a magister (master), a title which indicates that he had received a higher education, probably but not necessarily a university degree. If he did study at university, it was probably the University of Paris or possibly that of Bologna. He evidently had a legal education, and the popes praise his scientia litterarum (knowledge of letters). At least one 13th- century manuscript of the Secretum refers to its translator as magister philosophorum (\\"a master of philosophers\\"), and his language regarding Aristotle in the prologue suggests that he had some formal education in philosophy. His Latinity is good which, together with his affected modesty, suggests formal training in rhetoric. Some possible interpolations in the text of the Secretum in defence of astrology have been attributed to Philip, and a correction to its astronomy was almost certainly made by him. Throughout his career, he was a pluralist, which had only been permitted under canon law since the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215, when an exception was carved out for \\"learned persons\\". During his time in the Holy Land Philip seems to have picked up French, the lingua franca of the Crusader states, to judge by some gallicisms in his translation. =Antioch to Greece= In 1225, Philip was in his uncle's service at Antioch. When Rainier returned to Italy that year, he gave his nephew charge of the castle and fief of Cursat (Qu·π£ayr), where the patriarchal treasury was located. Philip was tasked with preventing the castle and treasure from falling into the hands of the cash-strapped Prince Bohemond IV of Antioch. Rainier praised Philip to the pope for the assistance he had rendered him during his bouts of illness. He died in September, apparently still in Italy. Pope Honorius III wrote to Philip ordering him to hand the castle over to the proper representatives of the patriarchate during its vacancy. Philip was still in east in 1227, when Pope Gregory IX granted him a canonry at Tripoli for his services to his late uncle. Philip may have already been an Augustinian, and was almost certainly a priest. He is described as having survived the perils of sea travel and the loss of property in the line of duty while serving Rainier. In 1230, Philip was back in Rome. His uncle's successor, Albert of Rizzato, requested his return to Antioch, but the pope gave him a dispensation to hold his benefices in absentia. He is also described at this time as the prior of Todi. The competition for Philip's services may have owed something to his knowledge of Arabic, a useful diplomatic skill. Philip may have remained in Italy a long time. In or shortly before 1238, he was granted a canonry in Byblos, but he was in Italy in 1238, when Gregory IX sent him as apostolic legate to Greece. There he collected a tax of one third on income and movable property from the Latin church in order to aid the Latin Empire. Gregory IX also ordered him to investigate the finances of the archdiocese of Patras. =Preferment under Innocent IV= Philip was back in Rome in 1243, when he denounced the bishop of Byblos as too poorly educated for his office. He had \\"neither read Donatus nor opened the books of Cato\\", in Philip's words. That same year, Pope Innocent IV re- appointed him to a canonry in Tripoli, having learned that two had recently become vacant. Philip had evidently never actually received a prebend upon his original appointment, presumably because none were available. The number of canonries attached to the Tripolitan cathedral had been reduced from eighteen to twelve in 1212 owing to the shrunken resources of the diocese. Although Gregory had appointed three men to assure Philip actually received a prebend, it does not appear to have worked. Even when Innocent was careful to wait for confirmation of a vacancy, Philip still had to fight for his canonry between 1243 and 1248. He also fought for at least nine years to receive his canonry in Byblos. The practice of papal provision of canonries could easily lead to situations like Philip's, in which numerous expectative canons were waiting at any time to receive an actual benefice. Innocent IV showed favour to Philip throughout his pontificate. They may have been personal friends going back to their days in the papal chancery in the early 1220s. On 11 September 1245, Philip was in Genoa as the nuntius (envoy) of Patriarch Robert of Jerusalem and archbishop of Nazareth to take possession of some relics they had purchased. He may have attended the First Council of Lyon in June and July as the patriarch of Jerusalem's representative. In 1247, he was with the pope in Lyon when Innocent IV ordered the patriarch to reward him with a benefice \\"notwithstanding the fact that he already had others\\". He was at that time acting as the patriarch's procurator (legal representative) in Europe. Between 1247 and 1251 Philip seems to have resided mainly in Rome, although he is known to have been away from the papal court on business at one point in 1248. Innocent IV wrote many letters on his behalf during this period of Roman residence. Possibly Philip was teaching law at the Studium Curiae established by Innocent in 1245. In 1248, with papal permission, he resigned his canonry at Byblos to his nephew, the scholar Nicholas. At that time he is first referred to as an honorary chaplain of Cardinal Hugh of Saint-Cher, an honour he held at least as late 1250. In or shortly before 1248, Philip was excommunicated by an unknown process. In 1248, Innocent IV, acting with the advice of Cardinal Pietro da Collemezzo, nevertheless confirmed him in the archdeaconry of Sidon to which he had been appointed and ordered the patriarch of Jerusalem and the bishop of Lydda to undo whatever action had been taken against Philip. Philip was by this time also a canon of Tyre, but the bishop of Tripoli was still opposed to him receiving his prebend at Tripoli. =Tyre and Tripoli= In 1250, Philip declined his disputed election to the archdiocese of Tyre, handing over the office to the pope. (He may have been elected several years earlier, the previous archbishop having died at the battle of La Forbie in 1244.) Nicholas Larcat succeeded to the vacant see and the pope appointed Philip to Nicholas' former office of cantor of Tyre. This was a non-resident office with substantial revenue, out of which Philip would hire the actual music director. The pope also rewarded him with all of the possessions of the bishop of Bethlehem in Tyre while confirming his prebends in Tyre and Sidon. By 1251, Philip was an honorary papal chaplain. That year, Innocent IV forbade any sentence (as of excommunication) to be levelled against him without an express papal mandate. He named the patriarch of Jerusalem and the abbot of Belmont as conservators of this order. In 1256, Pope Alexander IV sent Philip on a mission to the Holy Land: to restore property that rightfully belonged to the archdeacon of Tortosa. He can also be traced in the Holy Land in 1257, when he took out a loan from the Hospitallers on behalf of his superior, Opizo Fieschi, Innocent IV's nephew and the bishop of Tripoli, to finance the latter's voyage overseas. In 1259, he confirmed the Hospitallers' right to the tithe in the lands they possessed within the diocese of Tripoli. This was based on an original agreement of 1125, also made with a cantor of Tripoli named Philip. =Last years in Italy= By 1267, Philip was archdeacon of Tripoli. (Possibly he was the anonymous archdeacon to whom Pope Urban IV wrote in 1263.) He is referred to in documents with the title dominus (lord), an indication of an elevation in status. He remained an honorary papal chaplain under Pope Clement IV (1265‚Äì1268). He served as Cardinal Raoul de Grosparmy's deputy on his legatine mission to the Kingdom of Sicily. He settled an ecclesiastical dispute in Laurino (1266?) and was present when the legate pronounced a sentence at Cosenza (1267). During the prolonged conclave of 1268‚Äì1271, Philip worked for the assembled cardinals. His title changed from capellanus papae (chaplain of the pope) to capellanus sedis apostolicae (chaplain of the apostolic throne) during the long papal vacancy. In April 1269, the cardinals sent him to recoup the castle of Lariano, usurped by a certain Riccardello, and they granted him the power to excommunicate in order to do it. In May, they tasked him with determining the purpose of a group of armed Romans on their way to Viterbo (where the conclave was meeting). In October, he excommunicated Riccardello. He is last mentioned in 1269 with the title of general auditor of causes of the Sacred Palace (auditor generalis causarum sacri palatii), meaning that he could hear cases brought before the papal court and pass judgement subject to papal approval. Philip died probably not long after 1269. There was a new archdeacon of Tripoli by 1274. Translation Around 1230, Philip translated the complete Pseudo-Aristotelian Secretum secretorum from Arabic into Latin. There is evidence for the existence of his translation from the 1230s or 1240s at the latest. In the prologue of his translation, Philip describes how he was on a visit to Antioch with his bishop, Guy of Valence, when a manuscript of the Arabic Secretum was discovered there. At Guido's urging, he translated it into Latin. He dedicated it to the bishop. It is a \\"remarkably close and accurate\\" translation. Nonetheless, the only reference in the papal registers to Philip's literary abilities is Innocent IV's praise of him as scientia litterarum. Describing his method of translation in the prologue, Philip writes, \\"I have translated ... sometimes literally, and sometimes according to the sense, since there is one way of speaking among the Arabs and another among the Latins\\". The later Old French translator John of Antioch, also active in the Holy Land, may have been influenced by Philip's prologue. Over 200 manuscripts of Philip's translation survive from the 13th through 16th centuries. It was the first complete translation from Arabic, although the medical portions had been translated a century earlier by John of Seville, whose translation Philip utilized in his own. Roger Bacon edited and wrote a commentary on Philip's translation between 1243 and 1254, but Michael Scot in his Liber physiognomiae between 1228 and 1236 seems to have used the original Arabic version. A late medieval copy of the Book on the Inspections of Urine made for the Emperor Frederick II in 1212 attributes it to Philip of Tripoli and Gerard of Cremona. By that time, Philip's reputation was high and was associated with medicine. Some modern scholars have also suggested that he had training in medicine because he owned a copy of John of Seville's translation of the medical chapters and he was credited with helping his uncle during his illness. Another medical treatise, Experimentu notes minime reprobanda, is sometimes ascribed to Philip, but this is a modern misattribution. It is anonymous in all manuscripts but one, which attributes it to Thomas of Cantimpr√©.

Caecilius Jucundus in Pompeii, ca. 50‚Äì79 AD, Naples National Archaeological Museum. A concubinatus (Latin for \\"concubinage\\" ‚Äì see also concubina, \\"concubine\\", considered milder than paelex, and concubinus, \\"bridegroom\\") was an institution of quasi-marriage between Roman citizens who for various reasons did not want to enter into a full marriage. The institution was often found in unbalanced couples, where one of the members belonged to a higher social class or where one of the two was freed and the other one was freeborn. However it differed from a contubernium, where at least one of the partners was a slave.  In Roman law  What legally differentiated a concubinage from a marriage was a lack of affectio maritalis (\\"marital affection\\"), which was the desire of having a legal spouse, raise their rank, make them their equal, or the corresponding intent from the other party involved. A person registered in a concubinatus was not allowed to have a spouse at the same time. Emperor Augustus' Leges Juliae gave the first legal recognition of concubinage, defining it as cohabitation without marital status. Concubinatus came to define many relationships and marriages considered unsuitable under Roman customs, such a senator's desire to marry a freedwoman, or his cohabitation with a former prostitute. A quasi-marital relationship involving a Roman citizen and a foreigner was not considered a concubinage but was rather equated to a marriage between non-Romans (matrimonium juris gentium), without legal consequences except those deriving from the Jus gentium. While any couple could live in a concubinage instead of entering into a marriage, they were compelled to give notice to the authorities. This type of cohabitation varied little from actual marriage, except that heirs from this union were not considered legitimate. Often this was the reason that men of high rank would live with a woman in concubinage after the death of their first wife, so that the claims of their children from this first marriage would not be challenged by the children from this later union.  Concubina  The title of concubine was not considered derogatory (as it may be considered today) in ancient Rome, and was often inscribed on tombstones. Concerning the difference between a concubine and a wife, the jurist Julius Paulus wrote in his Opinions that \\"a concubine differs from a wife only in the regard in which she is held\\", meaning that a concubine was not considered a social equal to her patron, as his wife was. Concubines did receive much protection under the law, aside from the legal recognition of their social stature. They largely relied upon their patrons to provide for them. Early Roman law sought to differentiate between the status of concubinage and legal marriage, as demonstrated in a law attributed to Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome, circa 716‚Äì673 BCE: \\"A concubine shall not touch the altar of Juno. If she touches it, she shall sacrifice, with her hair unbound, a ewe lamb to Juno\\"; this fragment gives evidence that concubines existed early in the Roman monarchy, but also notes the banning of their involvement in the worship of Juno, the goddess of marriage. Later the jurist Ulpian wrote on the Lex Julia et Papia, \\"Only those women with whom intercourse is not unlawful can be kept in concubinage without the fear of committing a crime\\". He also said that \\"anyone can keep a concubine of any age unless she is less than twelve years old\\".  Concubinus  A masculine of concubine, concubinus, \\"man in a concubinage\\", \\"male-lover\\", was also regularly used in Latin, although it is attested less often than concubina. See, for instance, Tac. A. 13, 21: \\"Nunc per concubinum Atimetum et histrionem Paridem quasi scaenae fabulas componit.\\" (\\"Now through her paramour, Atimetus, and the actor, Paris, she is, so to say, concocting a drama for the stage\\").  Polygamy  Despite traditional Roman aversion against polygamy and the fact that according to the Roman law a man could not have a concubine while he had a wife, there are various notable occurrences of this, including the famous cases of the emperors Augustus, Marcus Aurelius, and Vespasian. Suetonius wrote that Augustus \\"put Scribonia [his second wife] away because she was too free in complaining about the influence of his concubine\\". Often, in return for payment, concubines would relay appeals to their emperor. This de facto polygamy ‚Äì for Roman citizens could not legally marry or cohabit with a concubine while also having a legal wife ‚Äì was \\"tolerated to the degree that it did not threaten the religious and legal integrity of the family\\".

Completed and commissioned in August 1944, she served in World War II and was converted into a kaiten suicide attack torpedo carrier in January 1945. She was sunk in February 1945 while operating during the Battle of Iwo Jima. Construction and commissioning I-368 was laid down on 15 July 1943 by Yokosuka Navy Yard at Yokosuka, Japan, with the name Submarine No. 5468. She was renamed I-368 on 25 January 1944 and provisionally attached to the Sasebo Naval District that day. She was launched on 29 January 1944 and was attached formally to the Sasebo Naval District that day. She was completed and commissioned on 25 August 1944. Service history Upon commissioning, I-368 was assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 for workups. On 2 November 1944 she was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 7. In January 1945, I-368 was converted from a transport submarine into a kaiten suicide attack torpedo carrier, the conversion involving the removal of her deck gun and Daihatsu-class landing craft and their replacement with fittings allowing her to carry five kaitens on her deck, On 10 January 1945, she and the submarine took part in simulated kaiten attacks against towed targets in the Seto Inland Sea that lasted 15 days. The Battle of Iwo Jima began on 19 February 1945 when U.S. forces landed on Iwo Jima. The landings had occurred sooner that the Japanese expected, so they ordered I-368 to cease kaiten trainingg early and formed the Chihaya Kaiten Group, made up of , , and the submarine , with orders to proceed to the waters off Iwo Jima and attack American ships there. On 20 February 1945, I-368 became the first kaiten carrier to get underway for Iwo Jima, departing the kaiten base at Hikari. I-368 was dead in the water on the surface west of Iwo Jima at 03:05 on 26 February 1945 when a United States Navy Grumman TBM-1C Avenger torpedo bomber of Composite Squadron 82 (VC-82) operating from the escort aircraft carrier detected her on radar. The Avenger overshot I-368 on its first pass, and she submerged. The Avenger returned and dropped a float light marker and sonobuoys, followed by a Mark 24 \\"Fido\\" acoustic homing torpedo. At 03:38, I-368‚Ä≤s conning tower briefly broke the surface near the float light marker, but she quickly dived again.

She is considered one of the earliest deaf feminists due to her advocacy for the equal education of deaf women. Her poems and articles were published in publications across the United States; in 1908 the deaf newspaper The Silent Worker called Fischer \\"one of America's great deaf poets\\". Early life and education Angeline Ashby Fuller was born in Savanna, Illinois on August 11, 1841. She attended local schools until the spring of 1854, when she lost her hearing after becoming ill with whooping cough and typhoid fever. Her family was unaware of any special education available for the deaf, but after seeing an article in the Northwestern Christian Advocate in 1859 she applied to the school for the deaf in Jacksonville, Illinois. She was eighteen years old when she began attending the Illinois School for the Deaf. She began writing her first poems and her teachers recognized and encouraged her to continue developing her talent for poetry. Severe problems with her sight caused by her earlier illness plagued her throughout her life. Spells of blindness and other illness cut her education short and she spent only two years at the school. Advocacy for deaf women After leaving school, Fischer developed an interest in helping the deaf community. She raised funds for St. Ann's Church for the Deaf in New York City. She instructed several deafblind children and in 1880 took a position as a residential dean at the Texas School for the Deaf, but poor health required her to return to her family's home in Savanna. After writing articles in the Deaf-Mutes' Journal, a publication offering advice and support to deaf women, Fischer became the leading feminist in the deaf community of the United States. Fischer attended the first convention of the National Association of the Deaf, arguing for the participation of women in NAD. She met her future husband at the convention: George E. Fischer was the deaf editor of a county newspaper. They married in May 1887 and lived in Omaha, Nebraska. In 1886, Fischer and Georgia Elliott began a letter-writing campaign to argue for admitting women to Gallaudet. Fischer threatened to start a separate deaf women's college as far from Gallaudet as possible if the administrators did not change their policy. In response, Gallaudet agreed to admit six women in 1887. Writing Her book of verse, The Venture, published in 1883, was one of the first literary accounts from a deaf perspective. Fischer wrote that deafness or blindness could not be understood solely as a hardship or a lack of ability. Ideas she presented in her poetry were so radical that they would take over a century to be revisited by scholars; these include the concept that deaf and disabled people have played central roles in foundational texts (such as the Bible), as well as arguing that disability was not located within individuals but as a result of the societal conditions that did not meet everyone's communication needs. Fischer's friends Oliver Wendell Holmes and John Greenleaf Whittier gave favorable reviews to the book. Fischer was considered one of the leading deaf writers of her era. One of her sonnets was featured in Harper's Monthly Magazine and her poems were featured in several anthologies. She published articles and verse in newspapers such as The Wisconsin Times, the Omaha Monitor, and the Thorold Post (Ontario). Fischer also managed a distributing agency with her husband. When her husband died in July 1904, she moved to live with her sister in Rockford, Illinois, and continued to write poetry and articles for the deaf community. She advocated for establishing a home for elderly deaf people. Her last article in The Silent Worker was a 1915 call for a memorial to Sophia Fowler Gallaudet in honor of Gallaudet's many contributions to the education for the deaf. Fischer died on April 2, 1925. Her efforts in promoting deaf women's rights have earned Fischer the recognition by disability scholars as one of the first deaf feminists.

Early life and education √úlo √ïun was born and raised in Tartu, one of two children of Ado and Alma √ïun (n√©e Lellep). He graduated from Tartu Secondary School No. 2 (now, the Miina H√§rma Gymnasium) in 1958. Afterward, he studied mathematics at Tartu State University (now, the University of Tartu) for a year, before enrolling at the State Art Institute of the Estonian SSR (now, the Estonian Academy of Arts) to study visual arts, with an emphasis on sculpting. He graduated from the institution in 1966. Career After graduating, √ïun worked as a taxidermist at the Estonian Museum of Natural History. His first exhibition was held at the Tallinn Art Hall gallery, with sculptors Ellen Koll and Aili Vint in 1970. In 1971, he became a freelance artist and began sculpting, mainly portraits and figural sculptures. He rose to national prominence in the 1970s, with a style that art critics have described as \\"friendly grotesque\\"; √ïun's sculptures could not easily be associated with any art movement known in Estonia at that time or compared with any \\"significant work\\". He distinguished himself from the generation of Estonian sculptural innovators of the 1960s by his characteristic deformation of form. √ïun was fascinated by color, fluidity, and the variability of forms in his work and addressed the subjective spiritual nature of man. His early exhibitions aroused passionate support and admiration from the public and critics, but was not without detractors. Isa ja poeg (1977) on K√º√ºni Street in Tartu One of √ïun's most notable sculptures is Isa ja poeg (English: Father and Son), created in plaster in 1977. The sculpture depicts √ïun and his 18-month-old son Kristjan nude, holding hands and standing at the same height. The work symbolizes the relationship between different generations, and the ephemeral period of childhood. The sculpture caused a furor when it was initially exhibited at the Tallinn Art Hall in 1977. In 1987, it was cast in bronze and originally installed in Tallinn. In the autumn of 2001, the Tartu City Government bought the sculpture and intended to install it on the slope of Toomem√§gi next to the Inglisild (Angel's Bridge). A granite base for the sculpture was made, but an ordinance was brought to light that only artwork and monuments related to the University of Tartu could be installed on Toomem√§gi. The sculpture was later unveiled for permanent display on K√º√ºni Street on Child Protection Day, 1 June 2004, in Tartu's Central Park, facing Town Hall Square. Isa ja poeg has become a well-known landmark of Tartu. In 1978, √ïun created portrait sculptures of Estonian cultural figures: painter Tiit P√§√§suke, artist Kaljo P√µllu, and actor and theater pedagogue Voldemar Panso, for which he won the Kristjan Raud Art Prize the following year. Other portrait scupltures by √ïun include those of composers Gustav Ernesaks and Veljo Tormis, author Eduard Vilde, actor and poet Juhan Viiding, actress Elle Kull, zoologist Harald Haberman, artists J√ºri Palm and Villu J√µgeva, and actors and theater pedagogues Kaarel Ird, Theodor Altermann, Paul Pinna, and Mikk Mikiver. His monument to Baltic German physiologist and professor Alexander Schmidt was opened in Kassitoome park on the grounds of the University of Tartu in 1982. √úlo √ïun's artistic output was prolific during his twenty-year career.

This misdiagnosis can come in the form of providing a BPD diagnosis to a person who does not actually meet criteria or providing an incorrect alternative diagnosis in the place of a BPD diagnosis.  Alternative diagnoses  A misdiagnosis of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) can be a result of a number of factors. One of these factors is the overlapping of symptoms between different disorders. As BPD consists of mood instability, Bipolar Disorder is often given as an alternative diagnosis. Additionally, trauma has long been looked at as a component of BPD can, therefore make the differentiation between Complex Post- Traumatic Stress Disorder and BPD challenging. = Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD) = Complex post-traumatic stress disorder (C-PTSD) is a diagnosis that was introduced in the International Classification of Diseases, 11th Edition (ICD-11) but is not present in the American Psychological Association‚Äôs Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 5th edition (DSM-5). C-PTSD is characterized by a combination of previously defined PTSD criteria (reexperiencing, avoidance, and hypervigilance) and criteria unique to C-PTSD (emotional dysregulation, interpersonal difficulties, and negative self-concept). The fact that these unique C-PTSD criteria are also core features of BPD makes the separation of C-PTSD and BPD comorbid with PTSD challenging. An evaluation looking to distinguish the difference between C-PTSD and BPD comorbid with can evaluate factors such as how criteria present differently between these groups. Criteria such as emotional dysregulation presents more often in the form of reactive anger and/or substance use in people with C-PTSD. In contrast, it presents more in the form of self-injury or suicidality amount people with BPD. Relationship instability presents more as rapid shifting between intense idealization to the belittlement of the relationship among people with BPD. In contrast, people with C-PTSD tend to have relationship instability as a result of not forming a close connection with their partner. As for self-image, people with BPD may have frequent shifts in their self-concept, while people with C-PTSD tend to have a more solidified negative self-image. These major differences offer insight into ways in which C-PTSD can either be incorrectly given instead of BPD comorbid with PTSD or vice versa. This is why it is important for clinicians to have completed a comprehensive evaluation prior to giving either of these diagnoses. = Bipolar disorder (BD) = Bipolar disorder (BD) is a mood disorder that is characterized by varying degrees of mood swings. BD can further be specified as either Bipolar Disorder I or II. The DSM-5 requires that a person with Bipolar I has experienced at least one manic episode and a person with Bipolar II has experienced at least one hypomanic episode and at least one depressive episode. Both manic and hypomanic episodes consist of \\"abnormally and persistent elevated, expansive, and irritable mood and...increased goal-directed activity or energy...\\" While misdiagnosis of BPD in regard to BD can come in both the form of diagnosing someone with BPD who actually has BD or vice versa, the more common occurrence is people being diagnosed with BD who actually better meet criteria for BPD. One study cited that almost 40% of people who were diagnosed with BPD were provided with a misdiagnosis of BD at some point in their lifetime in comparison to only 10% of people in the general population receiving a misdiagnosis of BD. The exact reasoning for this high rate of misdiagnosis is debated among researchers. Some theories posit that these errors are being made due to the instability of BPD being mistaken for the symptoms of a manic or hypomanic episode. Another study cites the simple ambiguity of BPD criteria as being the reason for misdiagnosis as people who met more criteria for a BPD diagnosis were less likely to be misdiagnosed with BD.  Consequences of misdiagnosis  Misdiagnosis of BPD can result in a number of negative consequences. The reasoning for diagnosis is that of debate within the mental health field. Still, it is primarily looked at as serving the function of providing health professionals of the patient's mental health state, to inform treatment approaches, and to aid in accurately reporting successful treatment approaches. Therefore, misdiagnosis can result in outcomes such as not having access to appropriate psychiatric medications or not being provided evidence- based psychological treatment for their disorders. = Medical = As diagnosis is an essential part of determining what medications to prescribe to a patient or if a patient would benefit from psychopharmacotherapy, being misdiagnosed can have a range of adverse outcomes. Current research has indicated while some prescription medications can help with specific symptoms of BDP, there is no medication proven to decrease BPD symptoms as a whole. In contrast, disorders such as BD have a range of psychiatric medications (e.g., Lithium, anticonvulsants, GABA analogs) being used as a first-line approach to treatment. By providing people with BPD with misdiagnoses such as BD, people with BPD can be subject to receiving medications that will not impact their symptomology and may result in adverse side effects. Alternatively, people who are diagnosed with BPD who may instead have BD or C-PTSD may be deprived of psychopharmacological interventions that would decrease symptoms severity. = Psychological = Misdiagnosis of BPD can also result in adverse psychological consequences as a diagnosis is used in determining evidence- based treatment approaches used in the therapeutic setting. Treatment approaches such as dialectical behavior therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy for borderline personality disorder are two evidence-based treatments shown to be effective in the treatment of BPD. By providing a misdiagnosis, a person with BPD would likely not have access to these specific treatment approaches, and therefore, their access to evidence-based treatment for their BPD would be delayed until an accurate diagnosis is given.

She was a paddle steamer schooner, built of pohutukawa, with kauri planks. In 1853 she left her Tamaki River service in Auckland and was sold in Melbourne in 1852 during the gold rush, but was soon serving as a ferry in Tasmania, until she had her primitive engines removed in 1858. She sprang a leak and became a beached wreck in 1873. She was built at Stone & Lanford's Freemans Bay yard for the builder's brother, C. J. Stone, and his partners, F. Gardiner, and Captain A. Cook. The ship was launched sideways on 24 December 1851. Her two steeple engines were fed by a double tubed Lancashire boiler, built by William Bourne's foundry. The foundry tools were rudimentary and work was delayed until an American boilermaker, Mr. Brown, arrived. He had no shears, rollers, or punching machine, but made a clay mould to bend the plates and had the holes manually punched in the boiler. The vessel was towed to Wynyard pier, where the Mayor named her. An anonymous letter to the New Zealander had said she was to be named after the Governor. A 1909 account said no name had been chosen, but that the governor was very pleased, so the name Governor Wynyard was chosen. Governor Wynyard made a trial trip on the Tamaki River on 10 January 1852, with one of her owners, Captain Cook, Mr. Brown being engineer. Due to his inexperience the boiler primed and he opened the safety valve, but drained too much water, so that the fire had to be damped down and water added with a bucket. After the initial delay she reached 8 knots. Her exhaust steam blew into her paddle-boxes, making an explosion on every piston stroke. A contemporary report said, \\"she makes full as much noise as speed\\". For her first 6 months she ran on the Tamaki River to Panmure and ≈åtƒÅhuhu, where some roads were not fit for carts, but settlers were reported to be annoyed if she didn't wait for goods beyond departure time. She then made a trial trip to Bay of Islands. A later source said there was insufficient trade on the Tamaki. In 1853 her paddle-boxes were removed and she sailed across the Tasman Sea to Melbourne, where she arrived on 26 August, worked on a ferry to Williamstown and was sold by her builder on 28 December 1852 for ¬£2,300. Several later accounts said she worked on the Yarra for many years, earning up to ¬£60 a day. However they are probably not true, as she started a Tamar River ferry service between Launceston and George Town in February 1854, owned by Benjamin Hyrons. She collided with the steamer Royal Shepherd in the Tamar in 1855, but was still on the George Town service in 1857, having had a major overhaul. Her engines were removed in 1858, leaving her as a sailing schooner. In 1899 it was said her engines had been transferred to her replacement on the ferry service, Tamar Maid. On Sunday 20 July 1873, during a voyage from Duck River to Launceston, Governor Wynyard sprang a leak and was beached as a wreck at Stanley.

Description Ventral view Like most orb-web spiders, A. australis shows considerable sexual size dimorphism; females (~25mm) are considerably larger than males (~6mm). When viewed from above, the abdomen is bright yellow with black cross-wise stripes and has an obvious knobby outline. When viewed from below the body is more finely detailed, and appears more black with patterns of yellowish spots and lines arranged symmetrically along the longitudinal axis. The legs have alternating bands of light (e.g. white, orange, yellow) and dark (brown, black) color. Web The circular web is usually constructed among shrubbery branches in the flight path of insects within about a meter of the ground. The spider remains on the web waiting for prey to become entrapped. The same web is used for a number of days and is repaired as needed. Taxonomy There has been considerable confusion both within the Argiope genus and the australis species. The Argiope were some of the first tropical spiders to be described, as far back as the early 1700s, probably a result of their relatively large size and colorful appearance. Because of this long history and the fact that early descriptions focused on coloration, which varies widely within a species, and abdominal shape, which is not diagnostic, numerous \\"different\\" species have been described which are in fact the same. Differences in genetalia are now recognized as being necessary for adequate diagnosis. In addition, many early descriptions were of females only; some Argiope species are still without descriptions for males. Distribution Argiope australis is found throughout eastern sub-Saharan Africa, including South Sudan. It is found as far west as the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, Angola and Namibia. It has also been found in Senegal.

Rather than seek reelection, Barnes instead decided to instead run for the state senate in 2020. Early life and education Barnes was born Donna Lisa Stone to Mr. and Mrs. Donald R. Stone in Nash County, North Carolina. She graduated from Southern Nash High School and Peace College before marrying Johnny Carson Barnes at Middlesex Church of God on December 12, 1987. She received a bachelor of arts degree in political science from North Carolina State University in 1988 and completed the legal assistant program at Meredith College. Political career Barnes ran for the 4th district seat on the Nash County board of commissioners in 2012, challenging incumbent Republican Danny Tyson. Central to the race was a proposed Sanderson Farms poultry processing plant, which Tyson, who was running for a third term, supported. Barnes, having previously cited environmental concerns about the project during her tenure on the county planning board, opposed it. She went on to win the primary and defeated Bert Daniel in the general election, becoming the county's youngest commissioner. In 2018, Barnes defeated former state representative Glen Bradley for the Republican nomination in North Carolina's 7th state house district. That November, she succeeded in unseating incumbent Democratic representative Bobbie Richardson, whose district was heavily redrawn in response to a federal lawsuit alleging racial gerrymandering by the state legislature. Barnes was sworn into office by North Carolina Supreme Court associate justice Paul Martin Newby. A year into her term, Barnes announced her intention to run for the 11th district state senate seat being vacated by the retiring Rick Horner in 2020. After defeating Johnston County commissioner Patrick Harris and retired Air Force colonel Dennis Nielsen in the March primary by a wide margin, she will face the Democratic nominee, former senator Allen Wellons in November. Honors In 2020, Barnes was listed as a \\"champion of the family\\" in the NC Values Coalition Scorecard. Personal life Barnes lives in Spring Hope, North Carolina with her husband, Johnny, president of Barnes Farming Corporation. They have three children: Bethany, Joshua, and Jacy. They attend the Ridgecrest Worship Center in Rocky Mount, where Barnes has served as co- president of Women‚Äôs Ministries.

She is well known for her criticism of the Thai monarchy. During the 2020 Thai protests, she has pioneered several rallies and Harry Potter-styled demonstrations calling for major structural reform of the Thai monarchy.  Biography  Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul was born in 1998 in Nonthaburi as the youngest child in her family and has two sisters. She was born in a middle class family which runs an auto workshop. She grew up with little political knowledge. Panusaya apparently had a quite introverted personality and grew up as quite a shy person. She was bullied by her friends at primary school. Her parents sent her to a five-month student exchange program in the United States which eventually helped her to express herself with more confidence and to be more proficient in public speaking. She initially had little interest in politics. Her father strongly encouraged her to research politics following the 2014 Thai coup d'√©tat. She became more interested in politics, having discussions and arguments on the subject with her friends at high school, after revising for her university entrance exams about the history of Thai politics. She is currently pursuing higher studies at the Faculty of Sociology and Anthropology at Thammasat University.  Activism  Panusaya entered Thammasat University and became more interested in politics. She began her political activism as a third year undergraduate student. In 2018, she joined a student union political party called Dome Revolution. In February 2020, she was part of the fresh pro-democracy protests against the Constitutional Court's decision to abolish the Future Forward Party, a popular reformist party which had the support of many Thai youth. In June 2020, she was issued an arrest warrant for violating the COVID-19 safety measures and for breaching the COVID-19 pandemic emergency rule after taking part in a protest conducted by the Student Union of Thailand over the forced disappearance of prominent Thai activist Wanchalerm Satsaksit. On 10 August 2020, she led demonstrations under the banner Thammasat will not tolerate calling for major monarchical reform and delivered a speech on a 10-point manifesto (the 'Thammasat Manifesto') in front of thousands of students. The speech was deemed controversial and sparked a political backlash in Thailand as authorities warned that the demonstration had seriously defamed the monarchy. Her speech included phrases such as \\"All humans have red blood. We are no different\\" and \\"No one in this world is born with blue blood\\", an allusion to the Thai monarchy. Following her controversial and widely reported comments, some critics and observers compared her to Agnes Chow of Hong Kong because of risking up to 15 years imprisonment under the provisions of the Thai l√®se majest√© law. On 20 September 2020, Panusaya along with fellow activists and protesters installed a people's plaque near Grand Palace in Bangkok. The protesters claimed victory after submitting their monarchical reform demands to the authorities.

The company is reported to be owned by China Zhenhua Electronics Group, which is owned by China Electronics Technology Group (CETC), a state- owned military research enterprise.

The company claims to work with the Chinese government, including Chinese intelligence agencies and the military. Zhenhua Data‚Äôs CEO has publicly supported \\"hybrid warfare\\" and \\"psychological warfare\\". Winston Peters, the Foreign Affairs Minister of New Zealand, stated that it would be 'naive' to think there was no connection to the Chinese state. In September 2020, a data leak revealed that Zhenhua was globally monitoring over 2.4 million people. The databases, collectively called the Overseas Key Information Database (OKIDB), was leaked to an American academic who shared the data with Internet 2.0, an Australian based cybersecurity consultancy. On 14 September 2020, a consortium of media outlets published the findings. Researchers found out that about 20% of the data was not from open source locations. Investigation by journalists in New Zealand found that some people with no online presence were profiled in the database. . There have been \\"conflicting assessments\\" of the value of the data, from it being an entirely \\"aspirational\\" venture, to it being a small peek into the world of hybrid warfare and psychological warfare being waged by the Chinese.

Prominent people in the database include prime ministers Boris Johnson and Scott Morrison and their families. Australians in the database include Natalie Imbruglia, Larry Anthony, Emma Husar, Ellen Whinnett and Junaid Thorne. Around 10,000 people and organisations from India were also on the list, including senior India diplomats such as Harsh Vardhan Shringla and Sanjeev Singla, policymakers such as Amitabh Kant, academics such as Romila Thapar, and sportspeople such as Sachin Tendulkar. Numerous Indian think-tanks were also being monitored.

The game is \\"reputed to be ancient\\", possibly dating to the Whaling Period before 1721.  Cards  A 36-card, French-suited pack is used with the cards A K Q J 9 8 7 6 and 5 in the four suits of Clubs, Spades, Hearts and Diamonds. In addition the K is replaced by the 3. The two, equal-ranking, highest cards or matadors are Toqutsit (\\"hangman\\" or \\"executioner\\"), the J, and Voormsi, the K. If both are played to a trick the second one wins. The third matador is the 8. Next in order are the Nines, Aces, remaining Jacks, Sixes, Fives, remaining Eights, Queens and remaining Kings. Within each rank they beat each other in the aforementioned suit order. The 3 is useless when led, but unbeatable if added to a trick. The Sevens have their usual Brusbart privileges: unbeatable when led except by the 3, a higher Seven or the K. If the K has been led or played on a Seven, it may be beaten by the K, a card that is otherwise useless. This feature appears in Brus, the Danish member of the Brusbart family. If the 3 is led and a Seven played second, the Seven has the same privileges as if it had been led.  Description  The following description is based on Smith (1998), supplemented by McLeod (2000):Vorms/Voormsi at pagat.com. Retrieved 18 September 2020. The aim is to score points by winning tricks and by capturing certain high cards. There are four players in two teams of two, the partners sitting opposite one another. Deal and play are clockwise and there are 9 tricks. The playing cutting the lowest card deals first, giving 4 cards to each player. The trick is won by the highest ranking card (subject to the rules above) and the trick winner leads to the next. After each trick, the trick winner replenishes his cards, followed by the others in order until the stock is exhausted. The game features double, triple and quadruple tricks whereby the player on lead may play a single card as normal or may lead two, three or four cards of the same rank. The others must play the same number of cards and must beat each of the led cards separately to win the trick, albeit not necessarily with cards of equal rank. If Voormsi is played and wins the trick (except as the last card or if Toqusit has already been played), 1 bonus point is scored and the Voormsi player shows his hand to an opponent to prove he did not have Toqusit. If the opposing team have Toqusit when Voormsi is played, they must play it, in which case they win the trick and score 2 bonus points. If a player beats his partner's Voormsi with Toqusit they lose all points and the game. Beating Voormsi with the 3 also earns a bonus point, whoever owned it. Beating Toqusit when it has just beaten Voormsi earns 2 points and the Toqusit bonus is forfeited. The winning team scores 1 point for taking five tricks plus 1 point for each additional trick taken. Winning the first five tricks earns 2 points, but winning all nine nullifies the deal. Play cannot end while one side has an unbroken sequence of tricks. A team scoring too many points goes bust and incurs penalty points to the value of his overshoot points. Players draw a ladder to score and erase or tick off one rung on their side of the ladder for each point. Game is nine points. This may be attained simultaneously by both teams e.g. if the trick breaking a sequence gives points to one side while the other's sequence is scored.  Variants  There are also two- and three-player variants.  Footnotes   References   Bibliography  *  External links  * Vorms/Voormsi at pagat.com.

He is renowned in Thailand for openly criticizing the monarchy of Thailand, breaking the country's taboo. He was initially regarded as a prominent human rights defender during his tenure as a human rights lawyer and later accumulated multiple criminal charges due to his active involvement in political activism. He is considered to be one of the leading figures of the 2020 Thai protests.  Biography  Anon Nampa was born in a family background rich in agriculture in Roi Et Province. His parents were rice farmers.  Career  Anon being dragged by officers upon his first arrest Anon completed his higher education at Ramkhamhaeng University graduating in law. He became interested in human rights in 2006. In 2008, he pursued a career as a human rights lawyer and went onto to defend court cases on behalf of prominent high profile activists, including Ampon Tangnoppakul and Phai Dao-din, during the 2010 Thai political protests. His ability in handling the court cases earned him the nickname of 'lawyer for the Red Shirts'. Following the 2014 Thai coup d'√©tat coup, Anon assisted fellow Thai lawyers in many human rights cases. He also started to engage in political activism himself. In 2015, he eventually co-founded the Resistant Citizen Group. Since becoming actively involved in political activism, several official cases have been brought against him, accusing him of violating the law. On 19 August 2020, Anon along with student activist Parit Chiwarak were arrested by officials after being charged for holding massive anti-government rallies on 18 July 2020 in Bangkok amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand. They were also charged for violating COVID-19 safety health guidelines under Section 116 of the Criminal Code. After the 18 July demonstrations, another rally was held by Anon Nampa along with fellow prominent activist Panupong Jadnok on 3 August 2020. During the demonstration, Anon called for structural reform of monarchical rule in Thailand and further accused King Maha Vajiralongkorn of creating unprecedented changes in the constitution. His remarks on the monarchy and royal family were deemed controversial by the authorities as defamation of the Thai monarchy is illegal and could incur a sentence of 15 years as per the provisions of l√®se majest√© in Thailand. He was arrested around three times in August 2020 for conducting two different rallies on 18 July and 3 August. In September 2020, the court revoked the bail appeal of Anon and Panupong Jadnok, and they were remanded until further notice. The court ruled that both of them had breached their bail terms by taking part in protests. Anon has been accused by ultra-royalist conspiracy theorists of being part of a 'People's Revolution' global conspiracy against Thailand.

It was the ninth episode of the fourth season of Playhouse 90 and the 126th episode overall. Plot The plot is a tragic love story set during World War I. A British Army officer (Capt. Leslie Cronyn) deserts his unit after becoming disillusioned with the war. He meets an American nurse (Janet Marshall) who holds a romantic view of the war as a glorious contest. The two fall in love and he finds new meaning in life, but complications arise, including Marshall's husband serving at the front and Cronyn's efforts to elude the military police and flee from France. Production Robert Stevens was the director. David Davidson wrote the teleplay based on Maurice Edelman's novel of the same title. The cast included Stephen Boyd as Capt. Leslie Cronyn, Dolores Hart as Janet Marshall, Judith Anderson as Madame Duvier (Marshall's superior), Boris Karloff as Guibert (an expert at smuggling deserters out of France), and Sam Jaffe as Schiller (a German grocer in France). To the Sound of Trumpets aired on a Tuesday evening, the first installment of Playhouse 90 after it ceased airing on a regular basis in its traditional time slot on Thursdays at 9:30 p.m. Reviews Fred Danzig of the UPI wrote that it was \\"filled with clinkers in acting, plot and technical details\\" and was often repetitious, yet it provided \\"some curiously gripping, moving moments\\" focusing on one man's responsibility to his fellow man. Danzig found Hart's performance to be \\"consistently excellent\\". On the other hand, he wrote that Karloff's performance appeared to be a satire of old Boris Karloff movies. Cynthia Lowry of the Associated Press found it entertaining and wrote that Playhouse 90, even in its new time slot, \\"remains one of television's enduring delights.\\" Another reviewer wrote that the production \\"has a tendency to ramble, but it contains some strong scenes and the message, which, while not new, bears repetition.\\" References Category:American television films Category:American films Category:Playhouse 90 Category:1960 television plays ","title":"To the Sound of Trumpets (Playhouse 90)"},{"id":"65338459","text":"Radulf of Barcelona was a Catholic Bishop of northern Spain between (about 885‚Äì942).Villanueva, Jaime.

History  = World War II = At the outbreak of hostilities, the 7th Division occupied the easternmost section of the Covering Position at the confluence of the Albert Canal and the Meuse river. As such it directly bordered the Netherlands, implying few obstacles existed between the German onslaught and its lines since the Dutch army did not defend the Maastricht area of Limburg province. Moreover, before any targets on the Dutch side could be engaged by artillery, express permission from general HQ had to be given. Compensating for these apparent weaknesses was the presence of the fortress of Eben-Emael, which was built alongside the Albert Canal and was considered at that time to be 'impregnable'. The 7th Division was to prevent an early breaktrough of the Albert Canal line by destroying the bridges of Kanne, Veldwezelt and Vroenhoven as soon as the invasion began. Unfortunately for the Belgians, the German invasion plan featured an all-out assault on this part of the Belgian front as part of the feint attack which was to distract the allies from the main attack at Sedan. So, when the Germans struck in full force early in the morning of May 10th, they made good use of novel airborne tactics on the lines of the 7th division. The Belgians managed only to destroy the bridge of Kanne, while the fort of Eben-Emael was neutralized by the Germans after just a few hours of fighting. By the early morning the Germans, supported by Stuka dive bombers, established wide bridgeheads on the West bank of the Albert Canal. Minor counterattacks, among others by the division's tank destroyer company, were easily repulsed by turning captured anti-tank guns against the Belgians. As soon as the main body of the German Panzer Divisions started crossing the Canal, the fate of the 7th Division was sealed. By the morning of the 11th, two of its regiments (the 18th Line and 2nd Carabiniers) disintegrated and remaining forces were in full retreat. The division's chief of staff and three regimental colonels were captured during the German's advance, along countless soldiers. 483 soldiers are estimated to be killed in action. After the initial fighting, the remaining troops of the 7th division were sent to Leuven and to France for regrouping and refitting.

The type species is L. begaaensis, which was named and described in 2020 from sediments of the Kem Kem Group in Morocco. It was a small animal with a long, slender bill which is thought to have been used to probe sediments for worms and other invertebrates, similar to kiwi birds and curlews. Leptostomia is likely a member of the Azhdarchoidea. Etymology In 2020, paleontologists Roy E. Smith, David Michael Martill, Alexander Kao, Samir Zouhri and Nicholas R. Longrich named the pterosaur species Leptostomia begaaensis. The generic name is a combination of the Ancient Greek leptos (meaning \\"slim\\"), and stoma (meaning \\"mouth\\"). The species name refers to the oasis village Hassi El Begaa, near the Aferdou N 'Chaft site where the pterosaur was found. Discovery The holotype specimen of Leptostomia, FSAC-KK 5075, was found in a layer of a river deposit of the Ifezouane Formation of the Kem Kem Group in Morocco. The age of which is uncertain, but it is believed to date back to the Cenomanian or perhaps Albian stages of the middle Cretaceous, about 112-94 million years ago. The holotype consists of part of the upper beak, located in front of the nasoantorbital fenestra. Specimen FSAC-KK 5076, a second fossil of the species, and the paratype specimen of Leptostomia, consists of the anterior part of the dentary symphysis. The preserved portion of the lower jaws may have lain in front of the holotype rostrum according to the authors' interpretation, with some overlap. The specimens of Leptostomia were examined by means of a CT scan. Description Leptostomia was a small, long-beaked animal with adaptations for sediment probing. The holotype consists of two beak fragments. The fragments of Leptostomia were mostly flat, and had thick walls, unusual for a pterosaur. The holotype of Leptostomia measured in length, and from this measurement, paleontologists have estimated a skull length measuring between . The muzzle of the animal is extremely elongated, only deep at the front. The jaws are toothless and slightly upcurved, and taper gradually toward the front. The jaws were also strongly flattened. The upper jaw had a narrow ridge, similar to that seen in many other pterosaurs, which would have occluded with a groove in the lower jaw. Classification Smith et al. suggest that Leptostomia was a pterodactyloid, and likely a member of the clade Azhdarchoidea, but its affinities remain unclear because of the fragmentary nature of the fossils. Because no pterosaurs closely resembling Leptostomia have been described before, it is unclear whether it belongs to a known family such as Azhdarchidae or Chaoyangopteridae, or represents a new azhdarchoid clade. Paleobiology The beak of Leptostomia is unlike that of any previously described pterosaurs. Instead, it closely resembles birds that feed by probing in sediment, such as kiwis, ibises, hoopoes and snipes. These birds typically feed on invertebrates such as earthworms (in soil) or polychaete worms, fiddler crabs, or bivalves (in estuarine or marine intertidal settings). Leptostomia's prey could have been sought by a sensitive system of nerve endings capable of detecting movement at a distance.  References  ?

Pigmentation has extensively been studied in Drosophila melanogaster. It has been used as a model for understanding the development and evolution of morphological phenotypes. Pigmentation shows enormous phenotypic variation between species, populations, and individuals, and even within individuals during ontogeny.It gives rise to natural variation, polyphenism and sexual dimorphism.It also varies between species, contributing to species recognition, mate choice, thermoregulation, protection (warning signals), mimicry, and crypsis. Changes in pigmentation are often adaptive and vital to the fitness of the organism. Much is known about the genes that regulate the biochemical synthesis of pigments in D. melanogaster and the genes that control the temporal and spatial distribution of this biosynthesis. Not only is body pigmentation ecologically relevant in Drosophila but it is also a relatively simple and easily measured phenotype to study the genetic architecture of natural variation in complex traits. Each tergite of female D. melanogaster generally has a stripe of dark coloration (melanin) on a lighter tan background (sclerotin). During pre-and post-ecdysis, the epidermal cells underlying the cuticle secrete tyrosine-derived catecholamines into the cuticle for sclerotinization and melanisation. The melanin/sclerotin biosynthetic pathway and its underlying genetic basis have been well studied. However, many of the genes known to affect D. melanogaster pigmentation do not form part of this pathway or any parallel pathway. Furthermore, the genes that lead to natural variation in body pigmentation are not necessarily the same genes that are directly involved in the biosynthesis of melanin and sclerotin. By mapping the genetic basis of natural variation in body pigmentation, new genes affecting pigment biosynthesis as well as regulatory regions that determine when and where pigmentation will develop were discovered.  Y gene  The y gene is required for the production of black melanin and in the absence of y, black melanin is replaced by brown melanin. In Drosophila melanogaster, y is sex- specifically regulated in the posterior abdomen. Furthermore, the evolution of wing or abdominal pigmentation patterns between Drosophila species correlates with modifications of y spatial expression. Temperature also controls the spatial expression of y in the abdominal epidermis of pharate females. By contrast, y expression associated with bristles is not modulated by temperature. y is known to be required but not sufficient for black melanin production.Studies have indicated that the black melanin is Dopamine-melanin and not Dopa-melanin. The combined over-expression of y and t at 29 ¬∞C is necessary and sufficient to reproduce the black phenotype observed at 18¬∞C. Thus, the stronger expression of y at 18¬∞C also contributes to thermal plasticity of female abdominal pigmentation. y is required but not sufficient for production of black pigment. Indeed, y gain- of-function must be combined to e down-regulation or t up-regulation to induce a fully black pigmentation. In order to test whether the strong expression of y and t is sufficient to explain the black pigmentation observed at 18 ¬∞C, the researcher increased their expression in abdominal epidermis at 29 ¬∞C to mimic the effect of lower temperature. On comparing the cuticles of wild-type females and females over- expressing either y (pnr-Gal4/UAS-y), t (UAS-t/+; pnr-Gal4/+) or both y and t (UAS-t/+; UAS-y/pnr-Gal4) at 29 ¬∞C. The y over-expression does not change pigmentation whereas t over-expression induces dark pigmentation in the anterior region of the tergites. However, careful examination revealed that this ectopic pigmentation was not as dark as the normal pigmentation in the posterior region of the tergites. This was more visible in A4 and A5 segments. By contrast, when both y and t were over-expressed in the dorsal region of the abdomen, the anterior region of the tergites was as black as the posterior border of the tergites. This shows that y and t combined over-expression at 29 ¬∞C is necessary and sufficient to reproduce the pigmentation phenotype observed at low temperature.  Production of dopamine-melanin by yellow gene  Yellow gene is required for the production of Dopamine-melanin. Yellow is related to two other enzymes, Yellow-f and Yellow-f2, which can be used as substrate for Dopachrome with a higher efficiency than Dopamine-chrome. Some authors have proposed that the black pigment in abdominal cuticle was Dopa- melanin produced from Dopa. Incubation of abdominal cuticles or wings of unpigmented pharates with Dopamine is sufficient to produce black pigment, which suggests that this black pigment is produced from Dopamine and is therefore Dopamine-melanin. It is also known that Ddc down-regulation leads to a complete loss of black and brown pigments.  Effect of temperature  Abdominal pigmentation in Drosophilids represents an appropriate model to dissect the molecular bases of phenotypic plasticity as it is sensitive to temperature in many species.Abdominal pigmentation of Drosophila melanogaster females is darker when they develop at low temperature. This is particularly pronounced in posterior abdominal segment. Plasticity of abdominal pigmentation is likely to have functional consequences as abdominal pigmentation has been linked to thermoregulation and resistance to UV, pathogens or parasites. Abdominal pigmentation is also associated to resistance to desiccation. Abdominal pigmentation differs between males and females in several Drosophila species and has been used as a model to dissect the genetic bases of sexual dimorphism. Furthermore, as abdominal pigmentation is highly evolvable, it has been investigated to study the molecular bases of morphological variation within species. The genes involved in Drosophila abdominal pigmentation are relatively well known, in particular those encoding the enzymes required for the synthesis of cuticle pigments. It has been reported recently that the thermal plasticity of female abdominal pigmentation in Drosophila melanogaster involves transcriptional modulation of the pigmentation gene tan (t). This gene encodes a hydrolase implicated in the production of melanin. t is seven times more expressed at 18 ¬∞C than at 29 ¬∞C in the posterior abdominal epidermis of young adult females. = Temperature modulation = It is shown by RT-qPCR that y expression is modulated by temperature in the epidermis of abdominal segments A5, A6 and A7 in female pharates (1.97 fold more expressed at 18 ¬∞C than at 29 ¬∞C). In order to analyse the spatial expression of y, many researchers performed in-situ hybridization of female pharates grown at 18 ¬∞C or 29 ¬∞C and could distinguish three stages of y expression (A, B and C) based on the degree of maturation of abdominal bristles . These stages correspond approximately to a transition from stage P11(i) to stage P12(ii) as described by Bainbridge and Bownes with morphological markers at 25 ¬∞C. In stage A pharates, two cells at the base of bristles expressed y. This expression had a similar intensity when pharates were raised at 18 ¬∞C and at 29 ¬∞C. These two cells are likely to be the socket and the shaft, the only pigmented cells of the bristle organ. In addition, y was expressed in the posterior region of each tergite in segments A2 to A6. This expression was much broader and stronger in pharates grown at 18 ¬∞C compared to 29 ¬∞C. In A6, y was expressed in the whole tergite at 18 ¬∞C, and only in the posterior region of the tergite at 29 ¬∞C. In A7, at 18 ¬∞C, the whole tergite expressed y at a high level, whereas it was much weaker at 29 ¬∞C. In stage B pharates, y expression was reduced in the socket and the shaft, while the bristle began to be pigmented. Furthermore, y was still more expressed in the abdominal epidermis of pharates grown at 18 ¬∞C than at 29 ¬∞C. In stage C pharates, y was no longer expressed at the base of bristles and the bristles were almost fully pigmented. Furthermore, its overall expression in tergites was reduced compared to stage B and more similar between pharates grown at 18 ¬∞C and 29 ¬∞C. Regulation of pigmentation Hox genes have been implicated in the evolution of many animal body patterns. Hox protein directly activates expression of the yellow pigmentation gene in posterior segments. In D. melanogaster, the male has fully pigmented tergites in the fifth and sixth abdominal segments (A5 and A6), whereas the female‚Äôs tergites have only a narrow pigment stripe. This sexually dimorphic pigmentation pattern is controlled by a genetic regulatory circuit involving the Hox gene Abd-B. Loss- of-function mutations of Abd-B cause the loss of male-specific pigmentation, while gain-of-function alleles, such as Abd-BMcp, cause the expansion of pigmentation to the A4 segment or even to the thorax. The sexually dimorphic pigment pattern depends upon regulatory interactions among the Abd-B, bab, and dsx genes. Pigmentation of the posterior male abdomen is a trait found in many members of the melanogaster species group but not in several other major groups. The dimorphic regulation of bab expression is closely correlated with dimorphic pigmentation as well other pigmentation patterns. It is not known, however, which regulatory interactions among Abd-B, bab, dsx, and pigmentation genes are direct and which are indirect.

He was arrested in 2001 following the results of a DNA profiling test, after being the prime suspect in several murders for many years. Before his arrest, two other men were wrongly convicted of several murders later attributed to Mosley: Frank Lee Smith, who spent 15 years in prison and died behind bars before he could be exonerated, and Jerry Townsend, who spend 22 years in prison before being released. Mosley's true victim count is unknown, with authorities speculating that he committed at least 16 murders and dozens of rapes.  Biography  Eddie Mosley was born on March 31, 1947, as the third of ten children of a Fort Lauderdale family. Complications during his birth later led to him developing an acute respiratory disease as a child, causing him a slew of issues. In addition, from an early age he began to show signs of an intellectual disability and mental instability, had problems learning and suffered from anterograde amnesia, because of which he repeated his second year of elementary school several times. In 1960, at the age of 13, Eddie was forced to leave school for good as a 3rd grade student. During his teenage years, he lived in poor conditions, and began to show signs of an antisocial personality. Owning to lack of formal education, he was forced to engage in low-skilled labor, but soon, due to financial difficulties, he turned towards crime. Since 1965, he had been arrested 9 times on varying charges, including indecent behavior, robbery, assault, attempted rape and murder, for which he spent 5 and a half years in prison and almost 6 in various psychiatric wards.  Crimes  In the period between November 1971 and July 1973, almost 150 rapes of girls and women were recorded in the northwestern part of Fort Lauderdale. In all cases, the perpetrator was described as a young, tall black man with an athletic build and a scar of his left cheek, whom, under the threat of physical violence, lured them to wastelands and other isolated areas, where he choked and sexually abused the victims. On July 23, 1973, three rape victims identified Mosley as their assailant, who, due to his physique and tall stature, well matched the composite of the rapist. After his arrest, his photographs were shown to other victims, resulting in more than 40 women identifying him as the rapist. During this period, Eddie was also the prime suspect in the rape-murders of two black girls in Fort Lauderdale, killed in early 1973, but since there was not enough evidence, he was only charged with three assault with subsequent rape. However, following a mental evaluation, he was found to be insane, and was ordered involuntary commitment at the Florida State Hospital, where he spent five years. During his imprisonment, no other similar rapes or murders were recorded. On February 1, 1979, Mosley was transferred to the South Florida State Hospital in Pembroke Pines. After completing a five-month treatment course, in the summer of that year, he was deemed cured and no longer a danger to society, and was released, but had to continue his treatment on an outpatient basis by visiting a psychiatrist at the Henderson Mental Health Clinic, in southwest Fort Lauderdale. After his release, Eddie moved back into his parents' house. Over the next seven months, seven young girls were found raped and murdered in the area. All of the murders were committed in the vicinity of Mosley's home, and he quickly became the prime suspect. In early 1980, fearful of the increased attention of law enforcement against him, left the city and moved to Lakeland, where his grandmother lived. Not long after, he became the prime suspect in the disappearances of two girls, Ida Eagles and Letha Mae Williams, who went missing shortly after his arrival. Mosley was arrested and subsequently interrogated, but was released, as the victims' bodies couldn't be located. He returned to Fort Lauderdale, where on April 12, 1980, he was arrested while attempting to rape a young girl. He was found guilty, and sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. While Mosley was in prison, the skeletal remains of Eagles and Williams were discovered near Lakeland. While incarcerated at the Broward County Jail, Eddie exhibited very aggressive behavior, often physically and sexually harassing other prisoners, and on one occasion, even confronting the guards and threatening to set the place ablaze. His family later hired a lawyer who filed an appeal to overturn his verdict in a new trial, citing the incompetence of Mosley's previous lawyer, who hadn't filed for a psychological examination of his client. The Appellate Court found significant flaws in the procedure, and would eventually overturn the conviction. At the new trial, the court took into account the mitigating factors and resentenced Mosley to a shorter prison term. Since he had spent more than 3 years in prison by that time, on December 15, 1983, he was paroled following a court decision. In January 1984, Mosley came under police suspicion again after the bodies of 35-year-old Geraldine Buffett and 54-year- old Emma Cook were found in northwestern Fort Lauderdale, raped and subsequently killed by suffocation. On May 24th, he was arrested for rape and attempted strangulation. Mosley was forced to take a psychological examination, which determined that he posed a danger to society and those around him. At trial, he plead not guilty, claiming that the sexual intercourse had been on mutual agreement. His lawyers managed to prove that the victim, who had previous convictions for drug possession and extortion, was prone to committing such offenses, and in October of that same year, Eddie was acquitted and released. After committing two more murders in the vicinity of Fort Lauderdale, the Broward County Sheriff's Office contacted the FBI, which, based on provided data, compiled an offender profile which was very consistent with Eddie Mosley's. In the spring of 1987, Mosley came under police scrutiny again , for the February 24th rape and strangulation of 24-year-old Sentreyl Love. On May 17, 1987, Mosley was arrested for theft. By that time, his blood group was matched with the semen samples taken from the bodies of the murder victims, and it was found to be a match. In the interrogations, Eddie showed evidence of his involvement in numerous crimes committed over almost two decades, all committed in the city or near his home. Faced with detailed descriptions of where the bodies were found, their names and descriptions, Mosley tried to make up an alibi, but began to mess up his testimony, getting dates, geographic data and even seasons wrong. In the end, he confessed to the murders of Teresa Giles and Emma Cook, with which he was charged. His trial began on July 22, 1987, with a number of sex workers working at the Fort Lauderdale red-light districts testifying that Mosley had repeatedly demonstrated aggressive behavior towards women in front of crowds of witnesses. Based on various tests, the defendant's IQ was measured at 51 points, below the average intelligence rate. Because of this, it was ruled that he was incompetent to stand trial, and on October 23rd, he was sentenced to compulsory treatment at the Florida State Hospital.  Exposure  For the remainder of his life, Mosley was shuffled between various clinics and mental institutions in the state. In 2000, a sample of his saliva and blood were taken for DNA testing, which proved his guilt in the following murders: 29-year-old Loretta Young Brown, killed in 1984; 34-year-old Vetta Turner, killed on July 9, 1973; 13-year-old Sonya Marion, killed in July 1979; 21-year-old Terri Jean Cummings, found dead in August 1979; and finally, the murders of Emma Cooo and Teresa Giles, to which he had confessed in May 1987. In addition, he was connected to the April 1985 murder of 8-year-old Shandra Whitehead, who had been raped and killed in her home. Another Fort Lauderdale man, 38-year-old Frank Lee Smith, who was intellectually disabled, was convicted in her murder. In 1960, at the age of 13, Smith killed 14-year-old John Wesley Spahn, but was released from custody in the mid-1960s, only to be later charged with the shooting death of 38-year-old Herbert DeWitt in 1966, who was killed during a robbery. He plead guilty to that murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment, but released on parole in 1981. In April 1985, he was arrested and charged with killing Shandra, after the girl's mother wrongfully identified him as the killer, based solely on photographs she had been shown. Despite the lack of physical evidence linking him to the crime, Smith was found guilty and sentenced to death in 1986. From the beginning, he had claimed his innocence in this killing. He died on death row on January 30, 2000, from cancer-related complications, only months away before a DNA test proved his innocence. Mosley was also charged with the murder of 15-year-old Naomi Gamble, thus proving the innocence of 49-year-old Jerry Frank Townsend, who was arrested in Miami in 1979 on charges of raping a girl. After his arrest, he confessed to killing Gamble, as well as five other girls and women, among them Barbara Brown (killed in Broward County in 1973) and Sonya Marion. The charges against Townsend were later dropped, and he was released on June 15, 2001, after spending 22 years behind bars. Like Eddie Mosley, Townsend had been diagnosed with as intellectually disabled from a young age. Aside from his proven murders, the investigators tried to connect Mosley to other murders: among them were that of 24-year-old Santrail Love; 19-year-old Arnette Tewkes, killed on February 22, 1980; 21-year-old Susan Boynton, killed in December 1979 and 16-year-old Gloria Irving, found murdered in 1980. However, Mosley's and the killer's DNA was deemed to be mismatched. Despite this, he hasn't been excluded from the list of suspects. After establishing his guilt, the Fort Lauderdale police issued an arrest warrant for Mosley. However, according to the results of two independent psychiatric tests, conducted at the end of 2001, Mosley was again declared insane and thus couldn't be imprisoned. Over the years of treatment, he earned a reputation as an exemplary patient, was never disciplined and acted friendly towards management and staff members. As a result of this, in the late 1990s, he was transferred to the low-risk unit and was allowed leave the hospital under supervision of staff, so he could make purchases in a nearby Walmart.  Death  In the 2010s, due to his ailing health, Eddie Mosley was transferred to the Sunland Hospital in Marianna. In the spring of 2020, he was diagnosed with pneumonia and moved to the Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, where he died on May 28, 2020, at the age of 73. Shortly before his death, he tested positive for COVID-19, which was later listed as the cause of death.

It was the 16th episode of the fourth season, and also the final broadcast in the four-year run of the CBS television series, Playhouse 90. The play depicted the struggles of Jews living in the Warsaw Ghetto in the months before the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Rod Serling wrote the teleplay, and the cast included Charles Laughton, Arthur Kennedy, Susan Kohner, and Robert Redford.  Plot  The play is set in the Warsaw Ghetto in the months before the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. It opens with a Nazi calling out names of Jews to be deported and closeups of grim Jewish faces as a song of Jewish mourning plays in the background. A Nazi asks: \\"They call them in here to pick out the ones who are to die, and yet they sing. Jews. Who can explain Jews?\\". Rabbi Adam Heller lives with his beautiful daughter Rachel. His son Paul returns home in the first act after escaping from a Nazi prison camp. The rabbi and his son are at odds: the rabbi believes faith will guide the Jews through the war, but Paul has seen the savagery of the Nazis and advocates resistance. A Christian peddler, Josef Chinik, aids the Hellers with food and books. Another character, Israel, collects weapons for an army of resistance forming in the ghetto. At the end of the first act, a German officer, Capt. Richter, and a younger German soldier, Sgt. Lott, arrive to investigate rumours that the building is being used by a resistance group. In the second act, Capt. Richter rapes Rachel. On learning of the rape, Rabbi Heller becomes disillusioned and says, \\"My life has been an endless prayer and prolonged supplication to a God without ears, to a God without eyes.\\". Paul takes a knife and leaves the apartment to kill Richter. In the final half hour, the Nazis conduct a search for Richter‚Äôs killer. Chinik falsely confesses that he killed Richter in order to save his Jewish friends. Chinik is executed, and his death causes Rabbi Heller to break down. Three months pass, and Rachel is pregnant. Paul and Israel talk of the uprising planned for that evening. Sgt. Lott returns to the Hellers' apartment, professes his love for Rachel, begs the rabbi for forgiveness, and offers to escape with her. The rabbi forgives Lott. Initially, Paul resists the idea of Rachel leaving with a Nazi but then relents, allowing them to leave. The play closes as the uprising begins with gunfire heard outside the apartment. Paul and Rabbi Heller walk down the stairs to join the uprising, a rifle in Paul's hand and a book in the rabbi's hand. Production Peter Kortner was the producer. Fielder Cook was the director, and Rod Serling wrote the teleplay. The cast included Charles Laughton as Rabbi Adam Heller, Arthur Kennedy as Paul Heller, Susan Kohner as Rachel Heller, Oscar Homolka as Josef Chinik, George MacReady as Capt. Richter, Sam Jaffe as Emmanuel, Robert Redford as Sergeant Lott, Otto Waldis as Kohn, and Bernard Kates as Israel. =Serling's script= Rod Serling originally submitted the story, then titled Epitaph for a Walled City, in April 1959. In the original story, Paul refused to consent to his sister leaving with Lott, and Rabbi Heller killed his son so that his daughter would have a chance to live. The script was approved by CBS, but was shelved when two of the sponsors objected to the \\"depressing\\" subject matter. A writer's strike in January 1960 created a shortage of scripts, and Serling's Warsaw Ghetto story was scheduled for production. The production was ultimately sponsored by Allstate Insurance, a consortium of natural gas companies, and Camel cigarettes. A commercial aired during the play extolling the benefits of \\"silent gas\\" has been criticized as \\"utterly inappropriate.\\" In one scene, Capt. Richter explains the purported virtue of anti-Semitism, telling Sgt. Lott \\"there is morality in hatred\\" as \\"nations can feed on it and be strengthened by it and in the process become unified.\\" Jack Gould of The New York Times found the exchange to be \\"absolutely chilling.\\" The play's title is taken from Psalm 23:5: \\"Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.\\"King James Bible, Psalms 23:5. Serling's teleplay was remade in 1997 for Showtime, also under the name In the Presence of Mine Enemies. Reception =Reviews= Jack Gould of The New York Times called it \\"a drama of searing tragedy and nobility.\\" He gave high praise to Serling's teleplay and its \\"moving affirmation of the dignity and indestructibility of the human being.\\" Fred Danzig of the UPI gave a mixed review. He wrote that \\"Serling's dialogue, as usual, was eloquent, sharp and rolled forth with great smoothness.\\" However, he found the overall dramatic effect to be that of \\"a debating society atmosphere where raw, desperate human feelings were called for.\\" Cynthia Lowry of the Associated Press called it a well-acted, grim and impactful drama that \\"pulled no punches\\" and \\"carried its bitter lesson.\\" In The Boston Globe, Percy Shain gave it a mixed review. He called it \\"powerfully written\\" and \\"grim, strong fare -- a story of stature -- something TV usually tries to avoid.\\" He also praised CBS for airing it and called it \\"a worthy requiem to a distinguished series.\\" On the other hand, he concluded it was \\"not entirely successful\\" as a drama as it lacked \\"the full-blooded flow of action\\" and ended up as \\"primarily a study in words rather than in deeds.\\" While he praised the performances of Kennedy and Kohner, Shain criticized the performances of Homolka, Jaffe, and Laughton. He found Laughton to be miscast and a \\"caricature of a man.\\" Serling also reportedly \\"loathed\\" Laughton's performance. Bill Fiset in the Oakland Tribune praised Laughton's performance as \\"superb\\" and wrote that \\"[t]elevision's most distinguished program\\" \\"went out in considerable style.\\" =Criticism as anti-Semitism= The CBS switchboard was flooded with calls after the broadcast, some complaining of the show's purported anti-Semitic aspects, including Paul's derision of his father's religious devotion and the sympathetic portrayal of Sgt. Lott. The novelist Leon Uris sent a telegram to CBS president Frank Stanton declaring the play to be \\"the most disgusting presentation in the history of American television\\" and demanding that the negative be burned. Stanton replied to Uris with a defense of the production and an expression of \\"shock that an eminent author would demand action tantamount to book burning.\\" References Bibliography * Category:Holocaust films Category:American films Category:Playhouse 90 Category:1960 television plays ","title":"In the Presence of Mine Enemies (Playhouse 90)"},{"id":"65339697","text":"Frankfurt am Main (A1412) is the second ship of the Berlin-class combat replenish oiler.

The road is sometimes referred to as the Nyanza Sugar Belt Road. Location The road starts at the neighborhood within Kisumu, known as Mamboleo, along the Kisumu‚ÄìKakamega‚ÄìWebuye‚ÄìKitale Road. From there, this road travels eastwards, through Miwani, Kibigori, Chemelil, to end in Muhoroni, approximately , from Mamboleo. For the most part, the road is within Kisumu County. Between the towns of Miwani and Kibigori, the road forms the border between Kisumu County to the south and Nandi County to the north. It travels through Nandi County for a short distance, between Kibigori and Chemelil. Overview This road was constructed in the 1960s, by the government of Kenya. Due to neglect, over the past two decades, the road deteriorated, developing potholes and gulleys. Public service vehicles abandoned the dilapidated road and instead used the Kisumu‚ÄìAhero‚ÄìAwasi‚ÄìMuhoroni Road, that is better maintained. The road is of economic importance to Kenya, because along this road lie at least three large sugar plantations and factories. Miwani Sugar Factory, Chemelil Sugar Factory and Muhoroni Sugar Company, all lie along this road. When upgraded, the road will ease the transportation of raw cane to the factories and of crystalline sugar to markets. The road is designated as a Class C road, (named C4 on map), and is under the jurisdiction of Kenya National Highway Authority (KeNHA). Upgrading and widening In 2020, the Government of Kenya, through its parastatal KeNHA allocated funds for the rehabilitation of this road. Tendering was done in March 2020. In August 2020, the government allocated KES:4.9 billion (approximately US$45.6 million) towards the resurfacing of this road to class II bitumen standard. Other improvments include widening the road to , with shoulders, culverts, drainage channels, passing lanes, bus stops and access roads in urban centers.

Photo of Oyster Boats by Owen Early life Owen was born in Bristol, England in 1808. He worked as chief cashier for the Great Western Railway of Isambard Kingdom Brunel. His first wife, Mary Anne, died in a home fire in 1846. His interest in photography began shortly thereafter, said by some observers as being a coping mechanism after her death. Learning photography It is likely that he learned paper negative techniques from Henry Fox Talbot. He perfected the silver calotype process in experiments conducted at his Bristol home. This complex process involved sensitizing the paper with a silver nitrate solution to produce images upon wet plates. Owen‚Äôs efforts rapidly received attention and he went on to be an early member of the Edinburgh Calotype Club in 1847. He was a founding member of the Photographic Society of London, attending its Inaugural Meeting on 20 January 1853. He was a vocal opponent of Frederick Scott Archer‚Äôs collodion process, particularly after he badly stained his fingers in 1855, when using the chemicals required by that process, although the use of chemicals such as collodion would soon supersede the calotype process. The Great Exhibition Owen‚Äôs calotypes were exhibited at the Great Exhibition in London in 1851. His images so impressed the Commissioners that, along with his French contemporary Claude-Marie Ferrier, he was asked to make 155 photographs of the exhibits. More than 140 bound sets of reports and accompanying photographs known as the Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations, 1851: Reports by the Juries on the Subjects in the Thirty Classes into which the Exhibition was Divided were presented to, among others, Queen Victoria, Heads of Foreign Governments, the Exhibition commissioners, and the British Museum. These remain Owen‚Äôs most famous photographs, and provide a good insight into how he approached his work. He tended to concentrate on individual objects in sharp focus, contrasted with shadowed backgrounds. Owen exhibited at the Royal Society of Arts in 1852 and a review in The Times listed him among the best photographers of the day. He rarely went too far from his Bristol home although he is known to have visited Portugal in 1853 or 1854, when he met the amateur photographer, Joseph James Forrester, and is likely to have also met another Porto-based photographer, Frederick William Flower. Although he gave up photography relatively early, he remained active in historical preservation, authoring the well-received Two Centuries of Ceramic Art in Bristol. He left his collection of ceramics to the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery. He became a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. Rediscovery Owen died in 1897. Although his work has been relatively neglected by historians, there are several of his photographs housed in museums and private collections, most notably in the City of Bristol archives, but also in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City; The J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles; and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Building on a collection of Owen‚Äôs photographs made by the Bristol photographer and historian, Reece Winstone, an exhibition of his landscapes, entitled Hugh Owen Rediscovered, was held in New York City in 2016, the first exhibition devoted to his work since the 19th century.

Moreover, progressively greater increases in healthcare capacity (raising the line) such as by increasing bed count, personnel, and equipment, help to meet increased demand. Mitigation attempts that are inadequate in strictness or duration‚Äîsuch as premature relaxation of distancing rules or stay-at-home orders‚Äîcan allow a resurgence after the initial surge and mitigation. Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve. This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed. Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning. More drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans. Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced the mass screening and localised quarantines and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges. Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems. Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed. Until now, the evidence for public health (nonpharmaceutical) interventions such as social distancing, school closure, and case isolation comes mainly from epidemiological compartmental models and, in particular, agent-based models (ABMs). Such models have been criticized for being based on simplifying and unrealistic assumptions. Still, they can be useful in informing decisions regarding mitigation and suppression measures in cases when ABMs are accurately calibrated. Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs. In August 2020, a working paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) questioned major effects of many mitigation and suppression measures. The authors compared the development of casualties connected to SARS-CoV-2 until July 2020, in 25 US states and 23 countries that had counted more than 1.000 overall deaths each. From the date a state passed a threshold of 25 deaths, the statistical study observed a largely uniform development, independently from type and time frame of governmental interactions. Thus, the growth rate of casualties dropped to zero within 20‚Äì30 days, and the variability between regions was low, except at the beginning of the epidemics. The authors computed the effective reproduction number Reff with the aid of different models like the SIR model, and found it hovering around one everywhere after the first 30 days of the epidemic. Hence, they did not find evidence for an influence of lockdowns, travel restrictions or quarantines on virus transmission. With link to the complete NBER Working Paper, August 2020, there Figure 2, p. 18. For contradicting studies, they assume an omitted variable bias. Candidates for ignored effects could be voluntary social distancing, the structure of social interaction networks (some people contact more networks faster than others), and a natural tendency of an epidemics to spread quickly at first and slow down, which has been observed in former Influenza pandemics, but not yet completely understood. The reviewer Stephen C. Miller concludes ‚Äúthat human interaction does not conform to simple epidemiological models‚Äù.Andrew Atkeson, Karen Kopecky und Tao Zha: Four stylized facts about Covid-19. NBER Working Paper, August 2020, Introduction p. 2‚Äì4, Conclusion p. 15‚Äì16. Retrieved 2020-09-12.  Contact tracing  Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and to prevent further transmission. The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has prompted privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than a hundred other organisations issuing a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance. Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7April 2020 more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions such as using Bluetooth to log a user's proximity to other cellphones. (Users are alerted if they have been near someone who subsequently tests positive.) On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced an initiative for privacy-preserving contact tracing based on Bluetooth technology and cryptography. The system is intended to allow governments to create official privacy-preserving coronavirus tracking apps, with the eventual goal of integration of this functionality directly into the iOS and Android mobile platforms. In Europe and in the U.S., Palantir Technologies is also providing COVID-19 tracking services.  Health care  An army-constructed thumb Increasing capacity and adapting healthcare for the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by the WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure. The ECDC and the European regional office of the WHO have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary healthcare services for shifting of resources at multiple levels, including focusing laboratory services towards COVID-19 testing, cancelling elective procedures whenever possible, separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and increasing intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds. In addition, in an attempt to maintain physical distancing, and to protect both patients and clinicians, in some areas non-emergency healthcare services are being provided virtually. Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chains, some manufacturers are 3D printing healthcare material such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts. In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently required a ventilator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver in the timescale required, a local startup received legal threats due to alleged patent infringement after reverse- engineering and printing the required hundred valves overnight. On 23 April 2020, NASA reported building, in 37 days, a ventilator which is currently undergoing further testing. NASA is seeking fast-track approval.

She was a leader of the Sakdal movement. Algabre was born in 1896 to an upper-class family in Laguna. Her father was Maximo Algabre, a landowner from Cabuyao, and her mother was Justina Tirones, a seamstress. Only nine survived out of her six siblings. Education Algabre was sent to Manila in 1903-1909 to obtain formal education. She lived with her uncle in Tondo, Manila. She was able to finish grade four until her mother made her stop due to fears of being taken away to the United States by her American teacher. She was privately tutored until 1st year high school. Family Algabre's family has a history of participation in the country's revolution. Her grandfather led the town as gobernadorcillo until he was banished because he refused to kiss the hand of Spanish friars. He slashed his throat as a gesture of protest against the civil authority of the colonizers. His father eventually lost his land properties. Both his grandfather and father fought as soldiers on battles against the Spaniards. Her uncle and relatives were also a member of the organization that spearheaded the country's revolution against Spanish colonial rule: Katipunan. Some of her relatives were exiled due to their illicit participation. Algabre had many suitors and chose Severo Generalla. She married him at 21 years old in 1915. Her husband was the president of the Tobacco Workers Union of the Philippines. Her husband got involved in labor movements and it led to some troubles so they left Manila and returned to her hometown in Cabuyao. There they owned a stall at the local public market and worked as farmers, despite the loss of their lands as they relocated back to the province. Revolutionary involvement Algabre and her husband worked as a landless peasant, and she lamented over oppressive land tenacy, claiming that the agreed percentage of shares weren't really achieved. Discussions with Filipino leaders and petitions expressed to the US government were fruitless. It prompted her to join the Sakdal movement at 36 years old. She was the only female member all throughout. When she met its founder, Benigno Ramos, Algabre agreed to organize and disseminate the movement in Cabuyao. Her house became its frequent meeting place. She eventually rose the ranks until she became its leader. She participated and led uprisings, piloting a troop of men to blockade roads and capture municipal buildings. The government, however, successfully crushed the rebellion in an uprising in 1935. Many were killed and Algabre was arrested. She was later released. A scholar once implied to Algabre the failure of the movement and Algabre claimed that she never regretted being part of it as it was the highlight of her life, and that: The movement's efforts didn't end in vain as the congress decided to consider and grant some of its appeals.

It is recognized as a prodotto agroalimentare tradizionale (traditional regional food product). Being deeply rooted in local cuisine, it is often defined as \\"The red gold of Basilicata\\". It is also fairly common in Calabria and limited uses can be found in Apulia, Abruzzo, and Molise.  Description  It is a dried and sweet-flavoured type of capsicum annuum. Usually the Senise pepper variety is used for its preparation, for the thin pulp and low water content which make it easier to be dried. It can assume three shapes: pointed, conical or hooked.  Cultivation  Sowing begins in spring and harvest between July and August. Peppers are placed on cloths for three days in shady and dry places. Afterwards, they are tied with a lace forming garlands, called serte, and dried outdoors in the summer period. By tradition, they are hanged on windows, balconies and houses' walls.  Culinary uses  The peperoni cruschi are a staple of the Lucanian cuisine. They can be consumed on their own as a vegetable chip, as a side dish, and as a flavour enhancer. Regularly they are cleaned with a dry cloth or kitchen paper, deprived of the petiole and the seeds and flash-fried for one or two seconds in hot olive oil, achieving a crispy texture after cooling down. Among traditional dishes with peperone crusco as a relevant ingredient are pasta con i peperoni cruschi, baccal√† alla lucana, acquasale, pane cotto. It is also used as a powder flavour to enrich meat, legumes, bakery products, chocolate and ice cream.

As co-founder and head of public relations company Savage & Best, Savidge is widely credited as being one of the main instigators of the Britpop musical movement that swept the UK in the mid 1990s. During this time Savage and Best represented many of the artists associated with the scene including Suede, Pulp, The Verve, Elastica, Longpigs, Menswear, Marion, Ultrasound, Echobelly, The Auteurs, Black Box Recorder, 60 Ft. Dolls and Kula Shaker. Savage & Best also started a record label, Parkway Records, in 1995 which released records by Powder (fronted by Pearl Lowe) and the all-girl punk band Fluffy. Savidge's first book Lunch With The Wild Frontiers: A History Of Britpop And Excess in 13 and a 1/2 Chapters was published by Jawbone in May 2019. Education and career Savidge was born in Derby. She was educated at Nottingham High School and Sherborne School, an independent school in the Market town of Sherborne, Dorset, before obtaining a degree in Philosophy at the University of Nottingham. In 1987 after leaving university, Savidge began her PR career working at Mel Bell Publicity where she represented Danielle Dax, The Wonder Stuff, Gaye Bykers on Acid, Green on Red, The Rhythm Sisters, Daniel Johnston, Soul Asylum, Thin White Rope and US record label Homestead Records. In June 1988 Savidge started work as a press officer at Virgin Records where she began representing Roy Orbison, Youssou N'Dour, Gary Moore, Jim Steinman, Suicidal Tendencies, Mary Margaret O'Hara and Peter Gabriel's Real World label amongst others. In 1990 Savidge left Virgin Records to join John Best at Best in Press and the company began managing publicity for bands such as Cocteau Twins, Pixies, Pale Saints, Dead Can Dance, The Farm, Moose, Lush, Curve, Suede and The Verve. The company was situated in the Camden Town area of London and many of the bands on its books were part of the shoegazing scene which Melody Maker later dubbed \\"The Scene That Celebrates Itself\\". Some members of this scene (Blur, Lush, Suede) would go on to play a leading part in Britpop but it was Savidge's PR success with Suede ‚Äì eighteen front covers of UK publications before their debut album was released ‚Äì that led to the acquisition of three Music Week PR Awards and the company morphing into its Savage & Best incarnation. Savage & Best are often acknowledged as launching Britpop since the company represented many of the movement's protagonists at the time including Suede, Pulp, The Auteurs, Black Box Recorder, Echobelly, Menswear, Elastica, Dubstar, Space, Kula Shaker, 60 Ft. Dolls, Ultrasound, Longpigs, Marion and The Verve. The latter were managed by Savage & Best for their first two albums. Savidge was featured in the film Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Brit Pop, a 2003 documentary film written and directed by John Dower. Savage & Best represented many other artists and projects during the 1990s including Tank Girl (The Movie), The Jesus and Mary Chain, Spiritualized, Texas, The Fall, Nine Inch Nails, Erasure, The Charlatans, The Cranberries, Faithless. Fluke and Fat Les. Savage & Best also founded a record label, Parkway Records, and released records by Powder (fronted by Pearl Lowe) and the all-girl punk outfit Fluffy. In December 1999 Savage & Best dissolved and Savidge formed Savidge & Savidge. The following year Savidge again represented Damien Hirst (who she had befriended through Fat Les) for Hirst's Art Tube project and for Keith Allen's Glastonbury Play which featured Hirst's stage designs. Savidge continued to represent Suede and Keith Allen amongst other artists but also diversified into club PR handling PR accounts for Soho House and Babington House as well as Home in Leicester Square. Around this time she also represented A.R. Rahman, multi-million selling composer of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Bombay Dreams. Savidge began representing David A. Stewart in 2001, and helped launch Stewart and Paul Allen's ¬£100 million Hospital Club project in Covent Garden. She also set up The Hospital Committee responsible for Club membership and in recent years Savidge has launched PR initiatives for Digital Animal and MOJN whilst continued to represent many of the artists she represented earlier in her career. Savidge's recent representations include James, Prefab Sprout, Chris Rea, The Stranglers, Don Black, Michael Nyman, Tony Mortimer, Gang of Four, Unkle Bob, Gregory Darling, and Michael Des Barres. Writing Savidge wrote sleeve notes to accompany all eight Eurythmics albums which were rereleased in 2005 and has written sleeve notes for other artists including Suede, James, Ride and Curve. Savidge's first book Lunch With The Wild Frontiers: A History Of Britpop And Excess in 13 and a 1/2 Chapters was published by Jawbone in May 2019 to much critical acclaim. The Glasgow Herald hailed the book as a \\"20th century glitterball take on Machiavelli's The Prince\\". Q magazine also praised the book as \\"an eye- opening, read in one sitting autobiography\\", whilst Classic Pop magazine awarded it five stars and heralded it is \\"an exhilarating and hilarious expose of the scene, recounted in a gloriously gossipy style with a vibrancy that sees it begging to be adapted for the screen, an addictive read which lifts the lid on the stories that hit the headlines as well as a fair few that were deliberately concealed. By far the finest book on Britpop to date.\\" Record Collector went further, calling her book \\"a rum old blast from a wonderfully ridiculous past whilst the fun lasts‚Äù , whilst Stylist magazine saw it as \\"a tale of the messy, exciting and truly invigorating whirl that created an unparalleled moment in British music. It's also a fascinating and funny step back in time to a world where demo cassettes and weekly music papers ruled Britain.\\" Awards Savidge has won several awards for PR in music. In 1991 Savidge won a Music Week award for Curve. In 1992 the Music Week Best PR Campaign went to Savage & Best for Suede. In 1995 and 1997 Savidge received 2nd place Music Week PR Campaign awards for Suede.

Nicolae Ghica-Bude»ôti was the architect, while Costin Petrescu painted the interior in 1908-1910. The paintings were cleaned and the iconostasis was gilt in 1926; further repairs were carried out in 1949. A choir gallery was added in 1919. The wooden iconostasis sculpted with floral designs has icons painted by Petrescu in 1907. Thorough repairs were carried out in 1992-1995, when the interior and part of the exterior frescoes were repainted. The church is triconch in form, with walls up to 1.5 meters thick. Adhering to the Moldavian style of church architecture, its dimensions are 22.65 x 10.60 meters. A large stone cross was placed on the right side of the church in 1906.

The play was premiered in 1955 by Andr√© Barsacq at the Th√©√¢tre de l'Atelier in Paris. The leading role of Valentin was created by Jacques Duby. Synopsis The young and imaginative Valentin is a supervisor at a private school. Although he is in love with the secretary Sylvie, he is still in the midst of a miserable, joyless human world. Egoism and malice, greed and avarice, lust for pleasure and uncontrolled instinct, mendacity and jealousy characterize the life of the directorate family related to him; Chabert and Valentin themselves are haplessly married, their marriages a pointless formality: parents and children are at war; Old Chabert suffers from the agony of work, his daughter Elisa from her ugliness, his sons-in-law are professional wretches who only know how to bring forth an excess of unwanted children, while his wife leads her unfulfilled life through the luxury of flashy hats and more amorous ones Seeks to enhance escapades. Poverty and quarrels in the school management's family are unpleasantly punctuated by the rebelliousness, stupidity and instinctiveness of the students, by the cruelty and dissolute lifestyle of their parents. In view of this overall less than human existence, Valentin decides to transform humanity all around into birds, which he typically calls a \\"spiritual operation\\", i.e. no magic, no trick game. In this way, on the spur of the moment and without much fuss, Valentin enchants everyone who \\"embarrasses him (!)\\", As he calls it. The lustful math teacher Bobignot, the lewd and untalented students Duperrier and Arbelin, the arrest-mad and \\"rough\\" inspectors Malfrin and Grindet, the sadistic Papa P√©risson, the humorless bureaucratic representatives of the school authorities and finally almost everyone around him. The transformed, however, by no means turn out to be cast out and subject to an evil curse, but rather as liberated and happy. After all, the moonbirds, which become humans again at the new moon, testify to the higher moral quality of their bird existence, because they have finally gained an eye for the essentials. Broadway The Broadway Premiere was released in 1959 by Leo Kerz and produced by Harry Belafonte. The production stars in Opening Night Cast Wally Cox as Valentin, Phyllis Newman as Sylvie and Mark Rydell as Raoul Martinon. Adaptations The drama was filmed in 1963 by Peter Zadek starring Klaus Kinski as Valentin and Ilse Pag√© as Sylvie. A television film was made in France in 1971 starring Jacques Duby as Valentin and Claude Jade as Sylvie. The film was directed by Andr√© Barsacq, who had staged the premiere of the play in 1955, in which Jacques Duby had played Valentin at the time. * * Category:1955 plays Category:French plays adapted into films Category:Adultery in plays Category:Broadway plays ","title":"The Moon Birds"},{"id":"65340196","text":"Doncaster UTC is a university technical college in Doncaster, South Yorkshire which opened in 2020.

In 1953, the Hellenic Parliament unanimously ratified the Council of Europe's human rights treaty, the European Convention on Human Rights, and its first protocol. Greece filed the first interstate case before the European Commission of Human Rights, Greece v. United Kingdom, in 1956, alleging human rights violations in British Cyprus. In 1967, following a military coup, the Greek junta abolished democracy, bringing itself into conflict with the Council of Europe. In September 1967, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands filed an interstate application with the Commission regarding human rights abuses in Greece. The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe also appointed a rapporteur, Max van der Stoel, to investigate the situation in Greece. On 12 December 1969, following the leaking of the Greek case report of the commission, Greece left the Council of Europe before the matter could be brought to a vote. After the fall of the junta, Greece rejoined the Council of Europe on 28 November 1974. Greece is the only state to have left the Council of Europe. The Constitution of Greece forbids proselytism, a blanket ban which European Court of Human Rights has ruled to be incompatible with Article 9 in multiple influential cases, including Larissis and others v. Greece and Kokkinakis v. Greece. In both cases, the Court found that, while banning proselytism may be justified under certain circumstances, a blanket ban violates freedom of religion.

Since its establishment in 1997, it has promoted biochemical and clinical research on the substance Coenzyme Q10 in an attempt to increase the body of knowledge about the preventive and therapeutic health effects of Coenzyme Q10. Coenzyme Q molecules are naturally occurring lipid-soluble redox molecules. In humans, they are found in the form of Coenzyme Q10. The most common source of industrially produced Coenzyme Q10 is a yeast fermentation process. The oxidized state of Coenzyme Q10, called ubiquinone, is essential to the process of mitochondrial bioenergetics. It plays a decisive role in the production of ATP energy. In its reduced state (known as ubiquinol), Coenzyme Q10 is an important lipid-soluble antioxidant. Coenzyme Q10 also regenerates alpha-tocopherol, the active form of vitamin E. Together with vitamin E, Coenzyme Q10 protects lipoproteins from oxidative damage. Research has shown that Coenzyme Q10 supplementation helps to counteract endothelial dysfunction and has anti-inflammatory effects. As such, Coenzyme Q10 supports good cardiovascular function.  History  In 1996, on the occasion of the Ninth International Symposium on Biomedical and Clinical Aspects of Coenzyme Q in Ancona, Italy, Dr. Karl Folkers, the chemist who had determined the structure of the Coenzyme Q10 molecule, laid the plans for the founding of the International Coenzyme Q10 Association. Dr. Folkers was assisted in the planning by Professor Gian Paulo Littarru, Ancona, Italy; Dr. Svend Aage Mortensen, Copenhagen, Denmark; Mr. Sven Moesgaard, Vejle, Denmark; and representatives of Kaneka Nutrients, all of whom were also attending the symposium in Ancona, Italy.Moesgaard S. Correspondence with Dr. Karl Folkers. 11 April 1996 and 18 November 1996. The plans called for the formation of a board consisting of leading Coenzyme Q10 researchers and a secretariat associated with the chairman of the board. The purpose of the new association was to promote biochemical and clinical studies of Coenzyme Q10. The first supporting partners of the International Coenzyme Q10 Association were Kaneka Nutrients, Japan, and Pharma Nord, Denmark. In 2020, the current supporting members are Jarrow Formulas, mse Pharmazeutika GmbH, and Nutrisan Nutraceuticals. The following Coenzyme Q10 researchers became the first board members: Gian Paulo Littarru (Chairman), Karl Folkers (Life Trustee), Svend Aage Mortensen (Vice chairman), Fred L. Crane (Vice chairman), Franz Enzmann, Takeo Kishi, Giorgio Lenaz, Anthony Linnane, Magnus Nylander, and Sven Moesgaard.  Structure and activities  As the first chairman of the association, Professor Gian Paulo Littarru established a secretariat in Ancona, Italy. When in 2013, Professor Pl√°cido Navas succeeded Professor Littarru as the chairman, he kept the secretariat in Ancona. Mr. Moesgaard and Dr. Folkers listed the following main purposes for the newly founded International Coenzyme Q10 Association: * To establish a forum for the exchange of information about Coenzyme Q10 research and to coordinate cooperation among leading world experts in the field of research in Coenzyme Q10. * To monitor the total field of Coenzyme Q10 research in a database. * To keep track of all major Coenzyme Q10 research projects on a volunteer reporting basis. * To offer advice on Coenzyme Q10 researchers with respect to study protocols, data collection, and data analysis. * To initiate research needed on a large scale to substantiate current uses and new uses of Coenzyme Q10. * To offer scientific know-how and advice to universities, governmental organizations, companies, and the public in the field of Coenzyme Q10. * To counteract health-scare issues and false statements about Coenzyme Q10 in the media. * To issue scientific information about Coenzyme Q10 on request and in the form of journal articles. * To plan and conduct international scientific symposia in the field of Coenzyme Q10.  By-Laws  In 1996, Dr. Folkers and the planning group drafted the original by-laws for the founding of the association. The by-laws had then to be amended to conform to Italian law, as the association was headquartered in Ancona, Italy. The current statutes, as last revised in Kobe, Japan, on 25 March 2014, can be found at https://icqaproject.org/statutes-of-the-association/.  Chairmen  From 1997 to 2013, Professor Gian-Paulo Littarru, Polytechnic University of Marche, Ancona, Italy, served as chairman of the association. From 2013 until the present (2020), Professor Pl√°cido Navas, Pablo de Olavide University, Sevilla, Spain, has been the chairman.  Board members  The following Coenzyme Q10 scholars are currently board members of the association (2020): Urban Alehagen (University of Link√∂ping, Sweden), M. Flint Beal (Weill Cornell Medical College, USA), Kerstin Elisabet Brismar (Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden), Maria Luisa Genova (University of Bologna, Italy), Keiichi Higuchi (Shinshu University, Japan), Michio Hirano (Columbia University, USA), Makoto Kawamukai (Shimane University, Japan), Peter Langsjoen (East Texas Medical Center, USA), Guillermo L√≥pez Lluch (Pablo de Olavide University, Spain), Franklin Rosenfeldt (Swinburne University, Australia), Roland Stocker (Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, Australia), and Luca Tiano (Polytechnic University of Marche, Italy).

Research publications  It is not possible to list all of the Coenzyme Q10 research projects that Professor Littarru and Professor Navas, as chairmen of the International Coenzyme Q10 Association, have encouraged and supported. Herewith a selection. = Aging and Coenzyme Q10 = In 2020, Professor Navas and the association arranged for the publication of a compendium of articles on the subject of Coenzyme Q in Aging. The articles show the importance of Coenzyme Q10 in the progression of aging and in aging-related diseases. Coenzyme Q10 is an essential factor involved in two main aspects of cell function: bioenergetics and antioxidant protection. The chapters in the book present current knowledge on the bio- synthesis of Coenzyme Q10, the nature of CoQ10 deficiency, and the results of clinical trials based on CoQ10 supplementation. = Bioavailability of Coenzyme Q10 = Professor Navas and Professor L√≥pez-Lluch and a team of researchers conducted a double-blind crossover study of the bioavailability of seven different Coenzyme Q10 formulations over a 48-hour period after ingestion of 100 mg. The researchers measured the Cmax and the area under the curve for each CoQ10 formulation in 14 healthy volunteers. They used a four- week washout period between the administration of each formulation. The study results showed that a ubiquinone Coenzyme Q10 formulation produced with a patented heating and cooling crystal dissolution process had a 48-hour area under the curve that was approximately four times greater than the corresponding area under the curve for a ubiquinone CoQ10 formulation not subjected to the same process. Similarly, the 48-hour area under the curve for a ubiquinol formulation was only 52% of the area under the curve for the patented ubiquinone CoQ10 formulation. The study illustrated that the formulation of the CoQ10 supplement is more important for absorption and bioavailability than the form is, i.e. whether ubiquinone or ubiquinol. = Cardiovascular disease and Coenzyme Q10 = Professor Littarru was a co-author on the Mortensen Q-Symbio Study of the effect of adjunctive Coenzyme Q10 treatment on morbidity and mortality in chronic heart failure patients. The study showed that daily supplementation with 3 x 100 mg for two years significantly improved the survival and symptoms compared to placebo treatment. In the European sub-population of the Q-Symbio Study, researchers found significantly fewer major cardiovascular adverse effects, significantly reduced risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, significantly reduced NYHA classification, and significantly reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. The KiSel-10 Study evaluated the effect of combined Coenzyme Q10 (2 x 100 mg) and selenium-enriched yeast (1 x 200 microg) daily for four years on the risk of heart disease in community living senior citizens. Compared to placebo, the combined Coenzyme Q10 and selenium treatment significantly reduced the risk of heart disease, improved heart function, and improved health-related quality of life. The beneficial effects of the supplementation persisted through the 12th year of follow-up. The researchers attributed the positive effects of the supplementation to the reduction of oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, and fibrosis. Professor Littarru was the lead author on a review of the effect of Coenzyme Q10 on endothelial dysfunction in ischemic heart disease. Compared with placebo, Coenzyme Q10 supplementation improved endothelial dysfunction in statin-treated type 2 diabetic patients. The average improvement in endothelium-dependent relaxation was six times greater in patients with plasma Coenzyme Q10 levels higher than 2.4 microg/mL as compared to patients with plasma Coenzyme Q10 levels below 2.4 microg/mL. = Physical activity and Coenzyme Q10 = In 2014, Professors Navas and L√≥pez- Lluch reported research results that showed that physical activity affects plasma Coenzyme Q10 levels differently in young and old humans. In young people, more strenuous physical activity was correlated with lower plasma CoQ10 levels; in older adults, greater physical activity was related to higher plasma CoQ10 levels and higher Coenzyme Q10 to cholesterol ratios. The higher plasma CoQ10 levels were associated with lower lipid peroxidation and lower oxidized LDL levels in elderly people. In a second study, the researchers showed that elderly people with higher levels of functional capacity had higher levels of plasma Coenzyme Q10 as well as lower plasma levels of cholesterol and lipid peroxidation. Elderly people with greater physical capacity had higher ratios of Coenzyme Q10 to cholesterol and Coenzyme Q10 to LDL lipoproteins. Safety of Coenzyme Q10 The association supported work on a review of the safety profile of Coenzyme Q10 based on animal and human data. Coenzyme Q10 has low toxicity and does not induce serious adverse effects in humans. Clinical trial data indicates that the observed safety level for Coenzyme Q10 intakes is 1200 mg/day/person. Exogenous Coenzyme Q10 does not influence the biosynthesis of endogenous Coenzyme Q10; Coenzyme Q10 does not accumulate in plasma or tissues after the cessation of supplementation. The data from preclinical and clinical studies indicate that Coenzyme Q10 is highly safe for use as a nutritional supplement.

He died on 15 November 2012 at the age of 76. Early life and career In 1936 Kader Bhayat was born in a wealthy family which originated from Surat in the state of Gujerat, India. He travelled to England where he studied law and was called to the Bar at the Lincoln's Inn. Political career He joined the Mauritian Militant Movement (MMM) in 1972 and soon became one of the party's foremost spokesperson, along with Anerood Jugnauth and Paul B√©renger. He is credited for his efforts to keep the party alive when its leadership was thrown in jail by the Labour Party-PMSD regime for close to a year in 1972 following the 1970 Triolet No.5 by-elections and the December 1971 strikes. Kader is the one who maintained communication between the political prisoners and their supporters known as \\"militants\\". He was elected to the Legislative Assembly in 1976 in Constituency No.2 Port Louis along with MMM candidates No√´l Lee Cheong Lem and Rajiv Servansingh. In 1977 he became the first Lord Mayor of Port Louis to be elected from within the MMM. At the 1982 general elections he was elected with the highest number of votes in No.2 Port Louis along with Vijay Padaruth and No√´l Lee Cheong Lem. He formed part of the Front Bench of the MMM-PSM ruling coalition under Prime Minister Aneerood Jugnauth's leadership and Kader became Minister of Commerce and Industry. Other members of that 1982 Front Bench were Harish Boodhoo and Paul B√©renger. When Jugnauth created his new party MSM in 1983 Kader Bhayat left the MMM and joined the MSM. At the 1983 elections Kader Bhayat was candidate at No.10 along with Sir Satcam Boolell. Although he had been presented as the next Deputy Prime Minister he only secured the position of Minister of Commerce and Maritime Transport as Ga√´tan Duval was made Deputy Prime Minister. In January 1986 he resigned from the MSM-Labour government along with Anil Gayan, Kadress Pillay and Kailash Purryag. Legal career In 1978 Kader Bhayat was politician Am√©d√©e Darga's defence attorney during the Sheik Hossen Scandal.During that same year Kader Bhayat represented MMM parliamentarian Vijay Jandoosing who was being prosecuted for having openly criticised the fine of Rs 500 which had been imposed on his colleague Krishnalall Coonjan by a magistrate in 1977. Jandoosing was sentenced to 6 months' jail by judge Maurice Rault. In 1989 he was the defence lawyer of Sir Ga√´tan Duval who had been arrested on charges of having plotted the murder of Azor Adelaide (1971) following statements made by ex-prisoners Paul Sarah and Moorgesh Shummoogum. In 1991 he was a candidate of the Labour Party against the MMM-MSM alliance. But at the 2000 elections he supported the campaign of the MSM-MMM alliance. From 2007 he formed part of the management board of the Bank of Mauritius where he supported Manou Bheenick during his term in office. Legacy Throughout his career Kader Bhayat ensured the welfare of his electorate. In 1977 when he was elected Lord Mayor of Port Louis he nominated a dock-worker called R√©gis Grivon as his assistant to remain close to the common folk. Later Kader Bhayat donated his private property in Mare Gravier, Beau Bassin to enable construction of a local mosque.

Life  Remmert was born in Gmina Grƒôbocice. She received her first piano lessons from her mother and the family tutor.Dieter Nolden, 2015. She took piano lessons from 1860 to 1865 in G≈Çog√≥w with Ludwig Meinardus and in 1865 and 1866 with Wilhelm Tappert, a pupil of Theodor Kullak. Probably against her parents' will, Remmert went to Berlin around 1867 to study piano with the aforementioned Kullak and Carl Tausig.Silke Wenzel, 2008. She lived there with her grandmother Friederike Sp√§th. When her grandmother died in 1871, her parents tried to persuade Martha to give up her studies. Through the intercession of Anton Rubinstein, whom she had met in Berlin, the Grand Duchess Elena Pawlowna supported Remmert financially in her education. She was thus able to continue her education in Berlin until 1871. From 1871, she continued her piano studies with Franz Liszt, first in Weimar and then in Budapest. From 1873 to around 1900, she built up a successful international career as a soloist and chamber musician. She undertook concert tours which took her through Germany, the Baltic States, Russia and to Greece, Egypt and Turkey. From around 1900 Remmert became more involved in institutionalised musical life. Here she sought to make the artistic and pedagogical approaches of Franz Liszt fruitful. In 1900, she founded the \\"Franz Liszt-Academie\\" in Berlin, where musicians received a wide range of training. In 1905, she founded the \\"Franz Liszt-Gesellschaft\\" and was its director until 1929. In this function, she organised numerous music festivals. During this period, she worked as conductor, composer and music writer. Remmert died in at the age of 87.

The 304th Infantry Division was deployed twice, once in November 1940 and once again in February 1945, after the destruction of the previous formation in January of that same year.  History  = First deployment = The 304th Infantry Division was formed as a static infantry division on 15 November 1940 as part of the 13th Aufstellungswelle in the area north of Leipzig. Its initial recruits were drawn from a third each of the 56th and 294th Infantry Divisions. The division was initially commanded by Heinrich Krampf. Initially, the 304th Infantry Division consisted of the following parts: * Infantry Regiment 573 (three battalions), drawn from members of the 56th Infantry Division. * Infantry Regiment 574 (three battalions), drawn from members of the 294th Infantry Division. * Infantry Regiment 575 (three battalions), drawn from members of both the 56th and the 294th Infantry Divisions. * Artillery Regiment 304 (three detachments), drawn from members of the 56th, 294th, and 162nd Infantry Divisions. * Division Units 304 The Artillery Regiment initially consisted of three detachments rather than the usual four, and those three detachment were understaffed in terms of batteries, only receiving the third battery of each detachment as late as 19 July 1942. On that same day, the three infantry regiments received their respective fourteenth companies. The thirteenth companies were only added in December 1942. In May 1941, the 304th Infantry Division was transferred to Belgium for occupation duties. The division was restructured from a static division to an attack division on 21 October 1942. It was transferred to the Eastern Front in December 1942. There, it fought against Red Army formations in the southern Don river area in the winter of 1942/1943. The division's first action was in the Donets sector, where it performed poorly. Starting on 16 November 1942, Ernst Sieler took command of the division, beginning his first of four tenures as division commander of the 304th Infantry Division. Said tenure ended on 1 February 1943, when he was briefly replaced by Alfred Philippi, but Sieler once again took the post on 1 March 1943 to begin his second tenure. On 20 February 1943, during the military reorganizations in the immediate aftermath of the German defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad, Infantry Regiment 574 was dissolved. Another regiment carrying the same ordinal number, the Grenadier Regiment 574, was reassembled on 4 May 1943, using forces from Security Regiment 610, then part of the 403rd Security Division. The retreat of Army Group Don from Stalingrad caused significant disarray in the sector at large and in the 304th Infantry Division in particular. The 304th Infantry Division was refreshed with new reinforcements in April 1943. The second and third battalions of Infantry Regiment 375, then attached to the 454th Security Division, became the new third battalion of Infantry Regiment 575 and the new third battalion of Infantry Regiment 573, respectively. These two new battalions were shortlived; they were deleted from the registry of the German military postal service in December 1943. Between March and September 1943, the 304th Infantry Division defended a sector of the Mius river. The division suffered heavy losses at Taganrog, and withdrew under significant Soviet pressure to the Dnieper bend. On 30 August 1943, Sieler was replaced as divisional commander by Norbert Holm, but once again returned to the post for a third tenure starting in October 1943. After Army Group North Ukraine was redeployed to the Generalgouvernement, the 304th Infantry Division was strengthened by the third battalion of Grenadier Regiment 685, previously part of the 336th (\\"Crimean\\") Infantry Division. The attached artillery regiment, Artillery Regiment 304, was supplied with parts of the first battery of Artillery Regiment 214 and of Reserve Artillery Detachment 14, the latter having previously been part of the 174th Reserve Division. as well as four additional artillery batteries. The 304th Infantry Division was destroyed in January 1945 in the southern Vistula region. The Soviet penetration of the Baranov/Sandomierz bridgehead had shattered the German defense in the region. The remaining survivors of the 304th Division were sent to Prague to prepare for the division's redeployment. On 10 January, Sieler had been replaced temporarily as divisional commander by Ulrich Liss, only to return on 22 January for his fourth and final tenure as divisional commander of the 304th Infantry Division, a post he would hold until 6 April. = Second deployment = The 304th Infantry Division was redeployed on 28 February 1945. By April, the division consisted of the following parts: * Grenadier Regiment 573 (two battalions), drawn from the first and second battalions of Grenadier Regiment B√∂hmen-M√§hren. * Grenadier Regiment 574 (two battalions), drawn from the remnants of the previous iteration of the 304th Infantry Division. * Grenadier Regiment 575 (two battalions), drawn from the F√ºhrer Youth Grenadier Regiment 1247. * Division Fusilier Battalion 304, drawn from the first battalion of Grenadier Regiment B√∂hmen-M√§hren. * Artillery Regiment 304 (three detachments (numbered I, III, IV)), fourth detachment drawn from the fourth detachment of Artillery Regiment 83 of the 100th J√§ger Division. The redeployed 304th Infantry Division was trapped in the Deutsch-Brod pocket and taken prisoner by the Red Army, capitulating after German surrender on 9 May 1945. The final two commanders of the division had been Robert Bader, who took the post from Sieler on 6 April 1945, and one Oberst Friedrich Kr√ºger (not to be confused with Friedrich- Wilhelm Kr√ºger of the SS), who surrendered to the Soviet forces on 9 May 1945.

Anthropogenic environmental and geographical changes brought to habitats when urbanization takes place are known to have a significant evolutionary impact on organisms inhabiting these city areas.Hendry, A. P., Gotanda, K. M. & Svensson, E. I. Human influences on evolution, and the ecological and societal consequences. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. B 372, 20160028 (2016) Biologists have observed evolutionary change in numerous species compared to their rural counterparts on a relatively short timescale. Strong selection pressures due to urbanization play a big role in this process. The changed environmental conditions lead to selection and adaptive changes in city-dwelling plants and animals. Also, there is a significant change in species composition between rural and urban ecosystems. Shared aspects of cities worldwide also give ample opportunity for scientists to study the specific evolutionary responses in these rapidly changed landscapes independently. How certain organisms (are able to) adapt to urban environments while others cannot, gives a live perspective on rapid evolution.  Urbanization  With urban growth, the urban-rural gradient has seen a large shift in distribution of humans, moving from low density to very high in the last millennia. This has brought a large change in environments as well as society. Urbanization brings transformation of natural habitats to completely altered living space which sustains large human populations. The increasing congregation of humans accompanies the expansion of infrastructure, industry and housing. Vegetation and soil are mostly replaced or covered by dense grey materials which alter the previous space. The process of urbanization is still rapidly expanding already established cities or building new ones. Three factors have come to the forefront as the main evolutionary influencers in urban areas: the urban microclimate, pollution, and urban habitat fragmentation.Schilthuizen, M. Darwin Comes to Town: How the Urban Jungle Drives Evolution (Quercus, London, 2018) These all influence; natural and sexual selection, mutation, gene flow or genetic drift. Which are the processes that drive evolution. = Urban microclimate = A microclimate is defined as any area where the climate differs from the surrounding area, and modification of the landscape and other abiotic factors contribute to a changed climate in urban areas. The use of impervious dark surfaces which retain and reflect heat, and human generated energy lead to an urban heat island in the center of cities, where the temperature is increased significantly. And a large urban microclimate does not only affect temperature, but also rainfall, snowfall, air pressure and wind, the concentration of polluted air, and how long that air remains in the city. These climatological transformations bring selection pressure and certain species have shown to be adapting to the urban microclimate. = Urban pollution = Species are evolving (or failing) to cope with contaminants in their environment in higher concentrations than naturally would occur. This is especially true in urban environments, since humans produce pollutants en masse when their population density rises. There are two main forms of pollution which lead to selective pressures: energy or chemical substances. Energy pollution can come in the form of artificial lighting, sounds, thermal changes, radioactive contamination and electromagnetic waves. Chemical pollution leads to the contamination of the atmosphere, the soil, water and food. All these polluting factors can alter species‚Äô behavior and/or physiology. Which in turn can lead to evolutionary changes. = Urban habitat fragmentation = The fragmentation of previously natural habitats into smaller pockets which can still sustain organisms leads to selection and adaptation of species. These new urban habitats come in all shapes and sizes, from parks, gardens, plants on balconies, to the breaks in pavement and ledges on buildings. The diversity in habitats leads to adaptation of local organisms to their own niche. And contrary to popular belief, there is higher biodiversity in urban areas than previously believed. This is due to the numerous microhabitats. These remnants of wild vegetation or artificially created habitats with often exotic plants and animals all support different kinds of species, which leads to pockets of diversity inside cities. With habitat fragmentation also comes genetic fragmentation, within small isolated populations, genetic drift and inbreeding results in low genetic variation of the gene pool. Low genetic variation is generally seen as bad for chances of survival. This is why probably some species aren‚Äôt able to sustain themselves in the fragmented environments of urban areas. However, in populations with lower genetic variation in the gene pool and less gene flow between populations this could provide opportunities. For certain smaller populations occupying niches, adaptive radiation may happen quicker.  Urban evolution examples  That urban evolution is happening can be seen in multiple examples of city-dwelling organisms. * The common blackbird (Turdus merula) may be the first example of actual speciation by urban evolution, due to the urban heat island and food abundance the urban blackbird has become non-migratory in urban areas. The birds also sing higher and at different times, and they breed earlier than their rural counterparts which leads to sexual selection and a separated gene pool. Natural behavioral differences have also formed between urban and rural birds. * The peppered moth is an example of industrial melanism. These moths changed color from light to dark due to anthropogenic air pollution during the industrial revolution. The black melanism phenotype frequency saw a rise during the time of heavy air pollution and a fall after cleaner air became more normal again in cities. * Urban Anole lizards (Anolis) have evolved longer limbs and more lamellae compared with anolis lizards from forest habitats. This because the lizards can navigate the artificial building materials used in cities better. * The urban Hawksbeard plant (Crepis) has evolved a higher percentage of heavier nondispersing seeds compared to rural hawksbeard plants, because habitat fragmentation leads to a lower chance of dispersing seeds to settle. = Genetic traits = Some already existing genetic traits can have an influence on the outcome which species can thrive in urban environments. The difference in standing genetic variation, which normally would not affect a species‚Äô population, can result in a dissimilarity in ability to adapt to environmental changes. The predisposition of some species to certain aspects of urban habitats also plays a role in how capable these species are to adapt to city life. Aspects, such as the physical similarity of their original niche, trophic requirements or behavior all make some species seem pre-adapted to their new anthropogenic environments. Urban environments can also lead to an evolutionary trap, this occurs when a sudden anthropogenic change in the environment causes an organism to make a decision that normally would be adaptive, but now results in a maladaptive outcome, although better alternatives are available. This leads to selection (natural when it kills the animal and sexual when is distracts from copulating)  References  Category:Ecology terminology Category:Community ecology Category:Habitat Category:Ecological processes Category:Evolutionary ecology ","title":"Urban evolution"},{"id":"65340932","text":"√âmile Desterbecq (born 31 January 1890, date of death unknown) was a Belgian racing cyclist.

The court found that legislative chambers in Australia have an implied power to compel their members to produce papers to the house, together with an implied power to counter obstruction where it occurs. In particular, the New South Wales Legislative Council had the power to compel Michael Egan to produce certain documents to the chamber, and when he refused to do so; the forced removal of him from the chamber by the Usher of the Black Rod did not constitute a trespass. The case is notable for having established that the powers and proceedings of Australia's legislative chambers are justiciable issues for the courts. Politically the case is notable as a significant embarrassment at the time for the Carr Government. Law professor Gerard Carney described the 'constitutional significance' of the case as 'profound', as they serve to 'judicially confirm the fundamental role of each House of Parliament to scrutinize the activities of the Executive Branch'.  Facts  In 1995 the NSW Legislative Council passed a resolution that there be tabled in the house, documents relating to various activities of the Government. In 1996 a further resolution was passed stating that it would be a sufficient compliance 'for the Minister to table the documents required by delivering them to the Clerk of the House'. Six days later the NSW Cabinet decided that they would decline to comply with the resolution. Michael Egan, a Member of the Legislative Council, had in his possession at least four documents capable of falling within the 1996 resolution. He asserted that the Legislative Council was unable to compel compliance with their resolution. He was ejected from the chamber for refusing compliance, and in response sued in trespass. The central question of the appeal was whether there was any justification for the trespass constituted by his removal from the chamber; a question which presented an issue as to the powers of the Legislative Council with respect to its 1996 resolutions.  Decision  The court found that 'If a member will not produce documents sought by the House there may be some limits to the steps it may take in response', and that '... one of the steps that the House may undoubtedly take is to resolve that the member be suspended for a limited time from the service of the House, and that is what happened here.'

Having become a Internet meme, the Lo-Fi Girl has been seen more than 218 million times.  History  Originally from Colombia, Juan Pablo Machado moved to Lyon in 2013, to study at the √âmile-Cohl design school, after a stint at the art school of Bogota. In September 2018, during his last year of his Master's degree, he decided to respond to a call for tenders received by his school.https://actu.fr/auvergne-rhone-alpes/lyon_69123/pop-culture-lofi-girl- live-youtube-lofi-hip-hop-radio-habite-lyon_32988561.html One such call for tenders came from the ChilledCow channel on YouTube, which continuously streams lo-fi hip hop. ChilledCow's visuals used to consist of scenes from copyrighted anime series, for which it has been taken down at least once; they thus put the word out for a creator to make original visuals for them. The tender called for a \\"student busy revising for her classes, with Miyazaki- esque visuals\\"; Machado, who was not previously familiar with lo-fi aesthetic, decided to send in his sketches. Several positions were tested for the Lo-Fi Girl, including a lying position, at the end of which she would return to her initial position; this did not carry over into the final product, because it took too long to animate. The background was also originally just plain black, in order to save animation time. But Machado eventually decided to make La Croix-Rousse appear in the window instead. ChilledCow began using the Lo-Fi Girl for their streams on 19 March 2018. She quickly went viral, and was established as an Internet meme in short order. In South Korea, the character was so successful that Machado was contacted by the Seoul museum to include her in an exhibition. However, the exhibition did not take place, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In popular culture The Lo-Fi Girl, localised to Scotland as an example of the September 2020 trend. Lo-Fi Girl has been widely referenced in popular culture. An example is contained within Steven Universe, where the character Connie is depicted studying in the same pose and environment as the Girl. In September 2020, a trend started on Reddit whereby the Lo-Fi Girl would be redrawn to match the context of a certain country or place. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, Daxed Digital writer Sophia Atkinson referred to Lo-Fi Girl as a \\"social distancing role model\\", it seemingly being \\"crystal clear that the anime girl was always operating in a post-coronavirus reality\\".

It is to be released on March 26, 2021. Gameplay As with other Monster Hunter titles, Monster Hunter Rise has the player take the role of a Monster Hunter, tasks with slaying or trapping large monsters using a variety of weapons, tools, and environmental features to damage and weaken them while surviving their attacks. Successful completion of the offered quests provide loot, typically in the form of various monster parts from the monster, which are used to forge new armor and weapons that can be used to take on more powerful monsters, forming the series' notable core loop. Several of the series' monsters return along with a host of new monsters developed for Rise. All fourteen weapon types that have been present in both Monster Hunter Generations and World, which mix archetypes of swords, shields, staves, bows, and guns, will be in Rise. Rise uses the game seamless map approach introduced in Monster Hunter World unlike the zoned area approach typical of earlier games in the series. Its maps are more focused on vertical movement than previous games, as implied by its title, so new tools are given to the player to help with quickly vertical scaling. One is the companion Palamute, a dog-like creature that the player can ride without losing stamina. The Palamute can quickly scale cliffs and can also be ridden and perform attacks while fighting monsters, alongside the player's cat-like companion Palico. A new tool, similar to the Clutch Claw added in Monster Hunter World: Iceborne, is the Wirebug, which can allow a player to grapple and swing across gaps or to higher locations as needed. The Wirebug also has different interactions with each weapon type, adding to that weapon's set of moves and combos. Rise features both single-player and online multiplayer modes with up to four hunters in a group. In single player modes, the player hunts with both their Palico and Palamute campions. In the online modes, players select either the Palico or Palamute to join them. The game will have cross-compatibility features with Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin, to be released after Rise, but which have not been detailed in full. Development Monster Hunter Rise is considered to be the series' next main game following Monster Hunter World, despite not being numbered in a similar fashion to previous titles. The game's producer Ryozo Tsujimoto said that with both World and Rise, they wanted to move away from the use of numbering for the main titles in the Monster Hunter series and instead name them based on a central concept that the game was built around, with Rise reflecting the verticality of the game's levels and gameplay elements. The verticality resulted in level design that resembled a medieval Japanese/Asian aesthetic, which had not been an initial goal of the design team but was happenstance from their design. Rises pre-planning development started after the completion of Generations and Generations Ultimate, and was co-developed alongside World, with ideas being shared between the development teams of the two games. The new title runs on the RE Engine that was developed for Resident Evil 7 and since used on other games like Resident Evil 2 Remake. As this is the first time this engine was used for a game of this type, it delayed some of the production as they worked to assure smooth gameplay within Worlds zoneless approach on the Switch and maintaining a reasonably high 30 frames-per-second framerate, considered essential for reacting quickly to the game's monsters. Further, the Palamute companion was developed with the portability of the Switch in mind, eliminating the depletion of stamina as the player rode it around the game world. Rise is expected to launch on the Nintendo Switch worldwide on March 26, 2021. Alongside its release, Monster Hunter Rise will include three Amiibo figurines of the Palico, Palamute, and the game's signature monster, the Magnamalo.

He was sentenced to death for his crimes, and executed in 2019.  Murders  On December 12, 2004, at around 23:40, 18-year-old vocational school student Nana Kubota was walking in a park in Iizuka, when she was attacked, raped and strangled with her scarf. The killer tried to steal her wallet, but was frightened off by passer-by. On December 31st, at around 7 o'clock, 62-year-old seasonal worker Toshiko Onaka was stabbed in the chest and back with a kitchen knife on the streets of Kitakyushu, with her assailant stealing her bag and wallet, containing 6,000 yen. Onaka would later die from her injuries. On January 18, 2005, at around 5:30, 23-year-old office worker Keiko Fukushima was attacked at a park in Fukuoka's Hakata-ku ward. The assailant originally planned to rape her, but refrained from the idea due to fear of being seen by a passer-by. He then stabbed Fukushima to death with a kitchen knife, stealing her mobile phone, purse and bag, which jointly contained around 46,000 yen. On March 8th, the investigators received a signal one of the victims' phones, which was being used in N≈çgata. They tracked down the signal and caught the criminal red- handed trying to embezzle a business. He had been using the phone for a dating service. The man, 35-year-old Yasunori Suzuki, was arrested two days later on suspicion of committing the murders. At the time of the murders, Suzuki was in debt of a total of 8 million yen, accumulated from drinking, gambling at pachinko machines and paying for online dating services, following a failed marriage.  Trials  = First instance, Fukuoka District Court = On June 29, 2006, days after the prosecution finalized its argument, the prosecuting Fukuoka Public Prosecutors Office demanded a death sentence for the accused.'3 death sentences for murdered of women: 'Brutal violator chose the weak' (June 29, 2006) Yomiuri Shimbun [in Japanese] On November 13, 2006, the Fukuoka District Court, headed by Justice Hiromi Suzuki (no relation), officially sentenced Yasunori Suzuki to death.Fukuoka District Court (2006) [in Japanese]'3 Death sentences for a man who killed a woman in Fukuoka, decision by Fukuoka District Court' (November 13, 2006) Tokyo Shimbun [in Japanese] A week after his sentence was announced, he lodged an appeal to the Fukuoka High Court.'Murderer of 3 women, Suzuki, appeals to the Fukuoka High Court' (November 21, 2006) Yomiuri Shimbun [in Japanese] = First appeal, Fukuoka High Court = On February 7, 2008, the appeal trial was held at the Fukuoka High Court, headed by Justice Katsuhiko Masaki.

After that, on February 18th, Justice Okabe notified that the verdict would be announced on March 8th.'Fukuoka women murders: Supreme Court will decide verdict on March 8th' (February 9, 2011) Mainichi Shimbun [in Japanese] On said date, Justice Okabe formally rejected the appeals from both the previous trials, effectively finalling Suzuki's death sentence.Supreme Court Trial (2011)'Defendant in the Fukuoka threefold murders's death sentence appeal dismissed' (March 9, 2011) Tokyo Shimbun [in Japanese] Suzuki would later file a petition to Okabe for a retrial, but on March 25th, his petition was rejected.'Suzuki, the murderer of the three Fukuoka women, had his death sentence confirmed' (March 29, 2011) Tokyo Shimbun [in Japanese] Two days later, he was sent to death row to await execution.  Execution  On July 31, 2019, then-Minister of Justice Takashi Yamashita officially signed Yasunori Suzuki's death warrant, set to take place at the Fukuoka Detention House. Just two days later, on August 2nd, the 50-year-old Suzuki was finally executed. On that day, 64-year-old Koichi Shoji was also executed at the Tokyo Detention House for two murders he committed in Yamato, Kanagawa. They were the two of three criminals executed in the country for that year.

They provided long-range early warning capabilities but also had the accuracy needed for interception plotting and \\"putting on\\" of other weapons systems like surface-to-air missiles. The name comes from the Martello towers that provided defence in earlier years. A key feature of the new design was its solution to measuring altitude. Earlier mechanically scanned 3D radars used multiple feed horns in a vertical stack, but this was difficult to make in a mobile form. Newer phased arrays used electronic phase shifters to sweep up and down to measure angles, but this required expensive electronics. Martello used fixed phase shifters to produce a pattern of eight stacked beams, recreating the multiple feed horn pattern in a small box that was inexpensive to implement. The system was initially offered to the RAF, whose Linesman radar network was the subject of much concern over its survivability due to its fixed locations and single control centre in London. It was suggested it should be replaced as quickly as possible by a mobile, distributed system. Around the same time, NATO was beginning the process of upgrading their Europe-wide radar network, NADGE, and their basic requirements were similar to the UK's. Martello was conceived to fill both requirements. The first S713 was introduced in 1978 and entered RAF service in 1982 as the AMES Type 90. Changes to the NATO specification led tp the S724, introduced in 1984 and entering service with the RAF in 1986 as the AMES Type 91. The S724, and product-improved S734 version found a number of international buyers. At least 22 members of the S700 family were sold between the late 1980s and early 2000s. The Lockheed Martin AN/TPS-77 has replaced the Martellos in the UK, as the AMES Type 92. History =S600= Marconi was the leading supplier of ground-based radars in the UK for many years, mostly working with designs developed at the Royal Radar Establishment (RRE) and its predecessors. These generally used large radars for 2D scanning to a plan-position indicator (PPI) display and separate height finding radars for measuring target altitudes. In the early 1960s, the company carried out several industry studies to better understand the future market. A new product concept emerged from this process, a long-range air-scanning radar to provide battlefield overview and early warning, what the British Army called a tactical control radar. The key feature was mobility; the design had to be able to be pulled by Land Rovers, slung under a Sea King helicopter, and fit within a single C-130 Hercules aircraft. The design also intended to use the same components to serve different roles, including air traffic control and fixed-place systems. It combined a traditional rotating radar scanner for detection and measurement of bearing with one or more height finder radars to measure altitude. A unique feature was that the main scanner optionally mounted two antennas back-to-back and could be operated in the S band and L band at the same time. Advanced moving target indication (MTI) systems were also included to suppress clutter. This concept emerged as the Marconi S600, which was first announced in May 1967 and demonstrated at the 1968 Farnborough Air Show. Orders began to arrive almost immediately, and over the next several years the company sold 74 systems worth over ¬£100 million to 15 countries around the world. This was a huge success, especially given the ¬£2.5 million cost of developing the system. =3D scanning= In the late 1960s a similar study started to look for new product lines to supplant or even replace the S600. This process produced several new requirements; like the S600, the system should be mobile or at least transportable, that it have improved jamming resistance, and that the era of the 2D radar and separate height finder used in the S600 was over and that the new design had to have a single 3D antenna. Normally a search radar's beam is shaped like a fan, very narrow from side to side in order to accurately determine bearing, and very wide top to bottom in order to catch any aircraft no matter its altitude. If one desires to accurately measure altitude with the same radar, the beam will need to be narrow in both directions, producing a \\"pencil beam\\" that has to be scanned in both directions. Marconi had worked on 3D systems in the past, notably the Orange Yeoman radar of the early 1960s. These used multiple feed horns to generate a series of pencil beams, each at a different vertical angle. The waveguide network and horns were complex and had to be accurately aligned during setup and maintenance, and a version robust enough to be mobile would be difficult to build. Another concern was the feedhorns generated side lobes with the first lobe on the order of -20 to -25 dB of the main beam. This meant that radar jammers were picked up multiple times as the radar rotated, both in the main beam and the sidelobes. One possible solution was found by accident; the AMES Type 14 and AMES Type 80 radars used an end-fed slotted waveguide to feed the radar signal to the antenna. When the magnetron was replaced during maintenance, the new one would have a slightly different frequency and this would cause the signal to shift several degrees. This undesirable effect became known as \\"squint\\". Development of feed systems that avoided squint was a major part of the S600 design. During the 1960s, several experiments were carried out to examine whether squint could be used to scan the beam in altitude while the antenna as a whole rotated to provide azimuth scanning, culminating in SQUIRT radar of 1967. This worked well, but it also meant that any aircraft flying at a constant altitude would always see the same frequency signal, making it easy to jam. Squint-steer went on to be widely used for civilian applications, but saw less use in military circles. Among its notable successes was the Plessey AR-3D. At the opposite end of the complexity scale was an experimental system designed beginning in 1965 by the Royal Radar Establishment as the Storage Array Radar, or STAR. STAR used a wide-beam transmitter that sent out pulses covering the entire area in front of the radar, as had been the case in Chain Home. An array antenna received the returned echos and each antenna in the array was equipped with the first stage of a superheterodyne receiver, converting the original microwave frequency signal to a much lower intermediate frequency (IF). A series of analog delay lines performed phase shifting on the IF to steer the beam electronically as well as store the resulting signal. The output of the delays thus stored the reception of the entire radar pulse. Radio correlators were then used to look for signals in common between the delays and thus pick out targets. In 1970 the RRE gave Marconi a contract to develop a prototype of a commercial version of STAR. They built a system combining an S600 transmitter with a new phased receiver that could be offered as an upgrade to existing S600 systems. Ultimately the system instead demonstrated that the concept was too costly to be economically attractive. This early work continued to be supported through the 1970s. =New concept= The majority of the cost of the STAR system was the complex signal handling system. This had to store the received returns over the entire period of the transmission pulse and then correlate the returns in that signal using a series of variable signal delays. In the new concept, the variable delays of STAR would instead fixed and produce a series of fixed-angle vertical lobes. Horizontal scanning would be achieved as it had in the past, by rotating the entire antenna array. Such a system can steer the beam vertically by delaying the signal as it is sent to the elements, and this phased array radar concept was being actively researched, especially in the United States. However, this required each element to have its own transmitter as well as receiver, and in the era of electronics made of individual transistors, these were very expensive. In contrast, Marconi's concept sent out a single fan-shaped beam as in STAR, and required only the receivers to be individual to each element. After conversion to the IF, the signal from each element was sent into a series of fixed delays, the \\"beam-forming network\\". These mixed the signals from different sections of the array, creating outputs that were sensitive in certain directions. The end result was a series of outputs, nine in the original design, eight of which were aimed in a different vertical direction while the ninth was an all-sky beam used for early detection. The aimed outputs were identical to those created by the separate physical feed horns in a system like Orange Yeoman, but implemented completely in electronics in a box about the size of a minibar. The system could be re- purposed to provide more vertical coverage or change the coverage pattern by replacing this box, with no changes to the antenna. Altitude information was extracted as it had been in Orange Yeoman; comparing a received pulse's strength in adjacent outputs allowed the vertical angle to be measured with some degree of accuracy. Such systems are known as \\"stacked beam radars\\". =Linesman and UKADGE= While development on new 3D systems continued, the Royal Air Force (RAF) was in the final stages of the installation of its latest radar network, Linesman. Linesman had been designed in 1958, in the era when the NATO response to any attack by the Warsaw Pact would be widespread use of its overwhelming superiority in air power to deliver tactical nuclear weapons against high-value targets. Any attack on the UK was assumed to be by bombers carrying strategic-sized hydrogen bombs, so no attempt had been made to harden the radar sites or the single centralized command center, L1. By the late 1960s, the USSR was reaching some level of parity in both tactical and strategic weapons, and the idea that any war in Europe would be met by the early use of nuclear bombs was obsolete. If the war was going to stay conventional, the USSR could easily risk an attack on Linesman with no fear of triggering a nuclear response. The RAF had long complained that the L1 station was highly vulnerable to any form of attack, even a truck filled with explosives, and the shore-side location of the radars made them easy to attack by low-flying aircraft. They repeatedly demanded that control of the interceptor aircraft take place at the radar stations rather than L1, ensuring that a single attack would not destroy the entire network. Even more worrying was that the data was communicated over microwave relay, which opened it to the possibility of being jammed, rendering the entire network useless. Other changes through this period including the new \\"plot extraction\\" systems that were highly effective at picking out moving aircraft, especially when they combined the information from more than one radar. By digitizing this data early in the process, it could be passed from site to site using modems on conventional telephones lines, which would provide much higher security and some level of redundancy. The pan-European counterpart to Linesman, NADGE, had semi-automated this process, but Linesman lacked the ability to read this data and plots being forwarded from NADGE had to be entered manually by voice telephone calls. Starting in 1972, the government redirected the money originally earmarked for upgrades to the Linesman system to be used to replace it as soon as possible with a new network known as UKADGE. Marconi joined a consortium with Hughes Aircraft and Plessey which won the contract to supply the networking systems, with Marconi supplying over 200 of the standardized operator terminals based on their Locus 16 computers. =Rampart= Marconi saw the introduction of the UKADGE system as an opportunity to make practical use of their stacked-beam design. They proposed a new radar with the same performance as the Linesman radars, but in a form that was semi-mobile, or \\"transportable\\" in UK parlance. Backup systems could be stored away from the radar stations and then set up rapidly in the event the station was attacked. Chain Home had only survived attacks by the Luftwaffe due to the availability of backup radar systems that could be put into operation within hours, and Marconi noted their design could offer the same capability. The proposal generated considerable interest and was formalized in 1973 as \\"Rampart\\". As Rampart was generally designed to meet the performance of the Type 85 and Type 84 radars of Linesman, it had several specific requirements. Among them was a very high maximum scanning angle to allow it to track aircraft as they passed overhead at high altitudes, rapid scanning to provide up-to-date data as interceptor aircraft approached their targets and a range on the order of . In 1975 they began building a prototype version for this mission, which became the Improved UKADGE (IUKADGE) project. =Martello S713= Although the UK was playing catch-up to NADGE with UKADGE, NADGE itself began its own upgrade process as well. Like UKADGE, this called for mobile radar systems and a decentralized command and control network. Preliminary specifications for the new radars had been released in 1973, and it appeared Rampart could be adapted to the NATO standard. One part of the standard specified the use of the S band for the radars. Marconi suggested using the L band instead, which would require much less power to reach the same range. This is a side-effect of the free-space path loss, which states that the energy captured by an antenna varies with the square of the wavelength, meaning that longer wavelengths are more efficiently received on an antenna of the same size. Longer wavelengths also suffer less reflection from very small objects like raindrops, making their performance in bad weather much better. The UK Ministry of Defense took up their cause within NATO, and in 1974 the requirement for S band was dropped. At this point, Marconi had what appeared to be a sure contract win with the RAF but that would be a small number of radars; Linesman had only three main sites and two secondaries. They also had what they believed was winner for the NADGE requirement. Based on this, they began development of a design specifically meant to meet the still-emerging NATO standard, which became Martello. The prototype, known as model S713, was shown at the Farnborough Air Show in 1978. IUKADGE was formalized as Air Staff Requirement 1586, which called for two D band radars and another three E/F band ones. Marconi won the contract for the D band with S713, whilst Plessy won the contract for the E/F band systems with a modified version of their civilian frequency-scanned systems. Further expansion was carried out using NATO funding as part of NADGE, leading to three further units which were installed in remote locations. =S723= By 1978 the NADGE process had produced a rather different set of updated requirements and the S713 was not able to meet the new specifications. Among the changes was the demand for higher angular resolution, while the required vertical angle resolution was relaxed. Feeling they still had a high chance of winning contracts for NADGE, Marconi took it upon themselves to develop a new version of the same basic system to meet the new requirements, the S723. During this period, semiconductor technology had been improving dramatically, especially in the high-power market where transistors were now available that were capable of controlling tens of kilowatts of power. Marconi decided to modify the original design by replacing the single twystron with a series of individual transistorized transmitter modules, one on each horizontal row. These had significantly less power output, even in aggregate, so to meet the range requirements the pulse length was extended. This would normally result in less range resolution, but this was addressed with pulse compression in the receiver, compressing the 150 ¬µs pulse to 0.25 ¬µs, the same length as the compressed pulse in the S713. To meet the angular resolution requirement, the number of antennas per row was doubled to 40 and the arms themselves made longer to hold them. Fewer arms were needed as the vertical coverage was not as great, and the number of outputs from the beam-forming network could be reduced to as few as six. The total area of the antenna increased from in the S713 to in the S723. The combination of the larger antenna aperture and newer electronics lowering the noise factor from 4 to 2.5 dB, resulted in the detection range increasing from just over in the S713 to over in the S723, in spite of the reduction in peak power from 3 MW to only 132 kW. The changes in electronics also resulted in a smaller system overall. The main spar now carried all of the electronics and no longer required the separate transmitter semi-trailer, and all of the processing and display was reduced to a single ISO container. This, along with the reduction in module count, reduced the setup time significantly. Lacking a single transmitter, the system could continue operating with as many as three elements out of service. The redesign also gave time to design packaging changes so the entire assembly now fit onto the antenna trailer and two ISO containers. S723 was introduced at the September 1984 Farnborough show.The RAF ordered four, and the first was delivered in June 1986. By 1989 the RAF had accepted the S713 in service as the AMES Type 90, and the S723s as the AMES Type 91. Another was ordered using NATO funds for installation in the Faroe Islands and operated by the RAF. Martello initially won only a single contract outside the UK under NADGE; the Royal Danish Air Force ordered two S723s, one of which they mounted on a tall tower. The first sale outside of NATO was the July 1985 sale to the Sultanate of Oman of two S713s, delivered in 1987/88. The Royal Jordanian Air Force ordered an unknown number in 1986. =S743 and S753 = By the late 1980s, new designs using active electronically scanned arrays for 3D scanning were becoming more widely available and the Martello design began to look dated. In response, Marconi began an upgrade process to produce the S734. This system was similar to the S724 in most ways, but introduced an entirely new data processing side that further improved performance and reliability. Greece ordered two with an option for a third in March 1990, and took up the option in March 1995. In 1988, Marconi was part of wide-reaching deal with Malaysia which delivered two S743's in 1992. Thailand chose the S743 over the US-built AN/FPS-117, concluding that two Martellos would provide the same coverage as three FPSs. A contract for four S743's for the Philippines was canceled in December 1995. Marconi introduced the S753 derivative at the September 1992 Farnborough Air Show. This was a reduced- resolution version of the system that was much smaller physically and thus easier to set up. It is not clear if any were sold. In 1998, GEC-Marconi and Alenia-Finmeccanica joined to produce Alenia Marconi Systems. They made their first sale in 1999, supplying two S743-D radars to Oman in 2002. No further sales of the system are known, as the new company had better success with their Selex RAT-31 system which had fully active scanning and won a number of contracts. Forecast International estimates that 22 S723's were produced. =S763 Lanza= In 1994, Marconi partnered with Ceselsa (today known as indra) to produce a new version of Martello for the Spanish market. This produced the S763, or LANZA as it is known in Spain. It is most similar to the S753 as it also uses the reduced module stack of 32 elements, but the new electronics increases mean power slightly to 5.35 kW. The Spanish Air Force ultimately purchased 10 units for their SIMCA radar network, which the first unit entering service in 2000. This led to a further version with reduced stack height of only 16 elements, the LANZA-MRR (for Medium Range Radar), with the original retroactively becoming LANZA-LRR. The MRR comes in two forms, one on a trailer that combines the entire system and can be set up and run as soon as power is supplied, and a similar version for use as a long-range naval radar. Description =S713= The original S713 design used a series of sixty wide horizontal arms, each holding 32 dipole antennas. These were clustered together into \\"modules\\" of five horizontal arms each, producing twelve removable panels that could be stacked on a flatbed trailer for shipping. The antenna modules were designed to withstand winds and the turntable had to retain their proper pointing angle at up to . They were also required to hold of ice with a total load of . A separate secondary surveillance radar (SSR) was normally mounted on top. The modules were mounted onto a vertical spine that was mounted on a turntable to provide azimuth scanning. The transmitted pulse was sent into a waveguide running along the spine through a rotating waveguide joint. The spine was raised using a hydraulic ram and stabilized with swing-out legs with their own rams for leveling. Installing the modules, raising the spine and connecting the systems together took about six hours. The beam-forming network produced nine stacked beams for altitude measurements. A single 3 MW twystron provided power to the entire set of 1920 antennas via the waveguide in the spine. The transmitter was large enough that it required its own semi-trailer, the main vertical spine and turntable were another separate semi-trailer, and the module stack another. Another ISO container held the electronics, communications, and the operator consoles, another the generator, and finally a custom trailer held the modules during shipping. The system used pulses of 10 ¬µs at about 250 pulses per second, for a mean transmitted power of about 10 kW. The beamwidth is 2.8¬∫ horizontal, and 1.5¬∫ vertical (at the horizon). It has a maximum detection range of about at 2¬∫ above the horizon. At its maximum altitude angle 30¬∫ it can detect targets up to 150,000 ft altitude at a range of . Altitude accuracy was about 1000 ft at . =S723= To meet the requirement for additional resolution for NADGE, the horizontal rows of antennas were made longer, holding 64 antennas per row on longer long horizontal arms. These were grouped into four modules of ten rows, for a total of 40 horizontal arms and 2560 individual antennas. The vertical spine was somewhat larger because it now held both the transmitters and receivers, but eliminated the need for the separate transmitter trailer and was somewhat shorter at tall. The number of vertical beams in the beam forming network was reduced from nine to eight, while the S723C model further reduces this to six. Each individual row had its own transmitter located where the waveguide feed would have been in the S713. Because there was no central transmitter, the transmitter trailer was removed from the convoy and the need to attach it to the spine was eliminated. Additionally, the receiver-side electronics, processing and display systems were all upgraded and now fit into a single ISO container. The result is that the entire system now uses only three trailers in total, the antenna, the operations consoles and the generator. With greatly reduced peak power of 132 kW, and the mean power roughly halved to 5 kW the pulse length was increased 15 times to 150 ¬µs to increase the amount of energy in the pulses back to about what it was in the S713. On reception, pulse compression reduced this to the same 0.25 ¬µs as the S713. Maximum detection altitude was reduced to about 20¬∫ but detection altitude at that angle was increased to about 200,000 ft at . Altitude accuracy was roughly half that of the S713, about 1700 ft at . =S743 and S753 = Continued improvements in solid state electronics, and especially microprocessors, led to the development of the S734, a product- improved S724. The primary change was the selection of a new transmitter module with a wider bandwidth, 130 MHz up from 100, and improved reliability. The signal processing system was also upgraded to a dramatically more powerful system using an array of 4,000 INMOS Transputers. The antenna was slightly modified to have 62 antennas per row, reducing beamwidth slightly from the 723's 1.6¬∫ to 1.4¬∫. The S753 is a tactical control radar version of the S734 with the explicit goal of reducing setup times. While the S723 required around six hours to set up, the S743 reduced this to four hours, and the S753 to one hour. To aid this, the vertical coverage is reduced by removing one module, leaving 32 elements, reducing the number of antennas per element to 40, and using the smaller beam-forming system with six beams.

The Vincennes Phase is a Mississippian Culture phase dating from 1100-1350 CE. This poorly-understood phase occupied much of the Lower Wabash Valley in western Indiana and eastern Illinois. Robert Barth proposed that the Vincennes phase evolved from the Allison-Lamotte culture, however this isn't universally agreed upon.. The Vincennes phase people were agriculturalists, dependant on maize to sustain their population. They were a multi ethnic people, composed of cultural traits from Middle Mississippian, Upper Mississippian, Fort Ancient, and Woodland cultures.  Etchison Complex  This complex is defined by strong relations with Cahokia, with a lack of the typical Vincennes ceramics found in the southern Vincennes area. The focal point of the complex is the Collins site, a multi-mound ceremonial center. This is the earliest Mississippian settlement in the region, and thought to represent a Cahokian attempt of spreading Mississippian religion. Joshua Wells posits a conjoining of the Etchison Complex and Southern Vincennes cultural area as a hegemonic Vincennes Phase.  Settlement Pattern  Vincennes phase towns and villages are usually located near a floodplain of a secondary river of the Wabash River. However in some cases such as the Merom site, the settlement was located atop a hard to access bluff, persumembly for defense. Large Vincennes phase sites contain central plazas surrounded by platform mounds and residential clusters. = North Vincennes = North Vincennes sites have a number of woodland components to them, namely Albee Phase housing styles, ceramics, and lithics being commonplace in north Vincennes settlements. Villages seem to be disjointed from the ceremonial sites. Northern Vincennes sites: * Secondino-Shew * Smith-Phelps * Farrand = South Vincennes = The Southern Vincennes cultural area is more reminiscent of Middle Mississippian communities, with Otter Pond being a large multi-mound ceremonial and residential center. Secondary settlements exist in a smaller form, seemingly subject to Otter Pond in some way. In short, this settlement pattern is suggestive of a chiefdom similar to those recorded by De Soto in the mid 16th century. Southern Vincennes sites: * Otter Pond * Gray's Pond * Merom * Blann Village * Heaton Farm  Material Culture  The material culture of the Vincennes Phase is unique for having influences from surround Woodland and Oliver Phase cultures. = Ceramics = The Vincennes everted rim jar is a major pottery type of the Vincennes Phase, representing 62% of all pottery recorded from Vincennes sites. Ceramics from Vincennes sites are often a hybrid, shell tempered Mississippian pottery being made in a Woodland Albee Phase style. Grit tempered pottery is also present in Vincennes ceramic assemblages. = Lithics = By far the most prominent lithic type of the Vincennes Phase is the Madison Triangular form. This exhibits an intensive use of the bow and arrow by the Vincennes people. Humpbacked knives and flint drills make up the rest of the Vincennes Phase lithic assemblage. Chunky stones and human effigy figurines are also present in Vincennes sites, often as grave goods.

Origins  The text was composed during the abbacy of √Ülffl√¶d of Whitby (680-714). Since the monastery was a double house, with both monks and nuns, it is possible that the text was composed by a woman.

Academic Career  Nikita Lomagin graduated from the Faculty of History of the Saint-Petersburg State University in 1986, briefly worked for the Russian Academy of Sciences and then returned to his alma mater to join the newly-founded Faculty of International Relations as professor of Global Policy. In 1997 he also graduated from the Faculty of Law of his University, since 1999 - professor of Global Economics in the Department of Economics of his alma mater. In 2000 he joined European University at Saint-Petersburg where from 2014 onwards he has served as a professor in the Department of Political Science at EUSP, Academic Director of the ENERPO program, Director of the ENERPO Research Center. Main subject of his studies in the Russian history is the Blockade of Leningrad during the Great Patriotic War. Lomagin's first thesis considered the counter- measures of the Communist Party against the German Nazi propaganda in Leningrad under siege. The thesis accomplished in 1989 was classified for official use only due to its content considered then politically-sensitive. His second thesis that earned him a doctoral degree was accomplished in 2005 and concerned the political control over the population of besieged Leningrad. Lomagin extensively worked in the archives on the topic of the Nazi blockade of Leningrad published \\"In the Vise of Hunger\\" - a collection of documents of German military and paramilitary forces as well as of the Soviet NKVD (People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs) that reflect the German aims, plans and actions that concern the besieged city, and the situation inside the starving Leningrad, on its supply routes and on the frontline. The book also features the letters that the city dwellers exchanged with their relatives and friends living on the non-occupied Soviet territory. Based on the revealed documents, Lomagin concludes that despite the tremendous death toll of the starving, but resisting Leningrad the perspective of surrender to the German Wehrmacht would have brought far overreaching human losses and strategic obstacles to the allied war effort against the Axis. In 2016 he was appointed the official opponent to the thesis of a revisionist historian Kirill Alexandrov that was dedicated to the phenomenon of Soviet collaborators to the occupying Nazi regime. Other areas of scientific interest for Lomagin are international economic and political relations of Russia, international cooperation in the Arctic region.

She was the first Mexican-American woman to earn a PhD in botany in the United States. She is currently a full professor of biology at the California State University- Northridge, studying plant development. She is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the first Latina fellow of the American Society of Plant Biologists, the first Latina fellow of the American Society of Cell Biology, and an elected fellow of the Institute of Science. In 2000, she was awarded the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring, which recognises individuals who have increased the participation of underrepresented minorities in their fields.  Early life and education  Zavala grew up in La Verne, California, and was one of five children. When she was young, her parents were farm workers, and picked lemons in the farms of Southern California. She credits her interest in plant biology to her grandmother, who was a curandera (a traditional medicine healer), and her father, who grew roses in their garden. She carried out her first experiments in plant biology at the age of seven, when she compared the growth of lentils in the sunlight and in the shade. In high school, she worked as a teaching assistant in chemistry and biology. She was also in her school band. Zavala went to Pomona College, where she majored in botany in 1972. She was awarded a Ford Foundation doctoral fellowship to continue her studies, and went on to do a PhD in plant cell biology at the University of California, Berkeley, graduating in 1978.  Research and career  Throughout her career, Zavala has worked at the United States Department of Agriculture, Yale University, as well as Michigan State University. She has worked at the California State University-Northridge since 1988. Zavala's research focuses on plant development, specifically the structure of roots. She focuses her research on beans and corn, with the aim of creating crops that can resist cooler temperatures. Her research has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the United States Department of Agriculture, and the National Institutes of Health. Zavala has also taken a keen interest in education equity, by helping to develop science curricula, and by establishing and directing programs to champion the participation of women and minorities in science. For example, she has been involved in American Women in Science, Women in Science and Engineering, Women in Cell Biology, the American Society of Plant Biologists Minority Affairs Committee, and the American Society for Cell Biology Minority Affairs Committee. Between 2001 and 2002, Zavala also served as the first Chicana president of the Society of Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science. She spoke at the 2017 Los Angeles March for Science. Additionally, she has been the director of CSUN‚Äôs Maximizing Access to Research Careers (MARC) Undergraduate Student Training in Academic Research (U-STAR) program since 1990, as well as the Research Initiatives for Scientific Enhancement (RISE) since 1993. She contributed to the book \\"Flor y Ciencia: Chicanas in Mathematics, Science and Engineering\\".  Awards and honours  Zavala is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

The design also evokes the opening line of the Ode to Labrador: \\"Dear land of mountains, woods and snow.\\" The three white mountain peaks represent the founding peoples of Labrador: the Innu, the Inuit, and the Settlers. The four spruce trees symbolize the four points of the compass and the great extent and diversity of the territory, its landscapes, and its communities and ways of life. The wavy bars symbolize the lakes and rivers, the bays and the sea. The alternation of white and blue represents the changing of the seasons, and by extension, the history of thousands of years of life in Labrador. The gold star is the Pole Star, symbolic of our northern environment and culture. As a symbol of navigation, it points the way to a bright future. Its points are our grandchildren, for whom we hold the land, its resources, and its heritage in trust. Compartment : A field of Labrador tea and caribou moss.

Description  The male has a total length of 5.3 mm, legs I to IV, have a length of 24.5, 31.8, 20.4 and 23.6 mm, the palp can be 5.4 mm long, females are larger, measuring about 8.5 mm in length, with legs ranging from 15.1, 16.0, 13.1 and 15, 5 mm, the palp of females measures 3.8 mm. Both male and female carapace ranges from dull yellow to orange brown, covered with black and subpretiated bristles. The cephalica pars varies from dark orange- brown to reddish-brown, with a U shape contrasting with the yellowish pars thoracica. The tubers of the eyes are enlarged, while the lateral marens are not dark, the abdomen is grayish or blackened, with the dorsal part darker than the ventral part, the leg segments vary from orange-brown to reddish- brown.  Behavior  It is a very shy spider, with nocturnal habits, building irregular webs under fallen tree trunks and debris, usually in dark places. They can also be found in human environments, in socks, clothes, blankets, wardrobes, garages and among others dark places. Their food, as well as that of several recluse spiders, is based on insects such as cockroaches, crickets and beetles. They have been reported to attack other arthropods such as scorpions. It breeds in the hottest months of the year, laying about 20 eggs taking 46 days for the juveniles to hatch. The female builds a bag-shaped web where the eggs are deposited.  Range  Loxosceles intermedia is native to Brazil and Argentina. They are found in temperate and warm regions of South America in southeastern and southern Brazil, as well as northern Argentina. They live in dark, very dry cracks, warm regions with elevations below 500 m, quite common around or inside the houses of humans.  Bites to humans  It's responsible for 1.000 envenomations in Brazil alone. As well as the Chilean recluse spider, the venom of Loxosceles intermedia has a concentration of the enzyme sphingomyelinase D, responsible for local and systemic effects, and is one of the main species attributed to deaths in South America, since the systemic effects of the bite occur frequently. The symptoms are not immediate, which leads the victim to believe that the bite was mild. They usually take hours to manifest, and begins with severe pain, redness, inflammation and blisters, in more severe cases evolving to tissue necrosis. Systemic effects, include hemolysis, minor hemorrhages, cardiac problems, vascular collapse and kidney failure. Moderate symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, fever and muscle pain are common with Loxosceles bites, especially from this species.

Completed and commissioned in May 1944, she served in World War II and conducted transport missions between Japan and Wake Island until she was converted into a kaiten suicide attack torpedo carrier 1945. She was sunk during her first kaiten mission in May 1945. Construction and commissioning I-361 was laid down on 16 February 1943 by the Kure Navy Yard at Kure, Japan, with the name Submarine No. 5461. She was renamed I-361 on 20 October 1943 and provisionally attached to the Yokosuka Naval District that day. She was launched on 30 October 1943 and was attached formally to the Yokosuka Naval District that day. She was completed and commissioned on 25 May 1944. Service history Upon commissioning, I-361 was assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 for workups. With her workups complete, she was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 7 on 15 August 1944. =Transport missions= On 23 August 1944, I-361 departed Yokosuka bound for Wake Island on her first transport mission. She arrived at Wake Island on 7 September 1944, discharged 70 tons of cargo, embarked 30 passengers, and got back underway the same day for her return voyage. She arrived at Yokosuka on 17 September 1944. While in Japan, she briefly ran aground on 4 October 1944. I-361 got underway from Yokosuka on 17 October 1944 for her second transport voyage, again setting course for Wake Island, which she reached on 29 October 1944. After unloading 67 tons of ammunition and taking five passengers aboard, she left the same day bound for Yokosuka, where she arrived on 9 November 1944. On 9 January 1945, I-361 began her final supply voyage, again destined for Wake Island. Calling there on 22 January 1945, she unloaded her cargo, embarked passengers, and got back underway the same day. She arrived at Yokosuka on 7 February 1945. =Kaiten carrier= After returning to Japan, I-361 was converted from a transport submarine into a kaiten suicide attack torpedo carrier, the conversion involving the removal of her deck gun and Daihatsu-class landing craft and their replacement with fittings allowing her to carry five kaitens on her deck, On 20 March 1945, Submarine Squadron 7 was deactivated, and I-361 was reassigned to Submarine Division 15. Between 26 and 29 March 1945, U.S. forces captured advanced bases and anchorages in the Kerama Islands southwest of Okinawa, and the Battle of Okinawa began when U.S. forces landed on Okinawa itself on 1 April 1945. By 24 May 1945, I-361 was part of the Todoroki (\\"Thunderclap\\") Kaiten Group along with the submarines , , and . With five kaitens on board, she got underway from the kaiten base at Hikari that day bound for a patrol area southeast of Okinawa. =Loss= On 28 May 1945, a United States Navy minesweeper detected I-361. The minesweeper alerted the escort aircraft carrier and the four destroyer escorts screening her of the contact, and Anzio and her escorts headed for the scene, with Anzio launching aircraft from her embarked Composite Squadron 13 (VC-13) to conduct a series of searches for I-361. At 04:36 on 31 May 1945, a VC-13 TBM-1C Avenger torpedo bomber established radar contact on I-361, which was on the surface southeast of Okinawa. Dropping out of a cloud, the Avenger sighted I-361 at a range of about , misidentifying her as an \\"I-161-class submarine\\" without a deck gun and not reporting any kaitens on her deck. The Avenger fired four rockets at I-361, and the plane‚Ä≤s crew believed they had scored two hits. I-361 crash- dived. The Avenger then dropped sonobuoys and a Mark 24 \\"Fido\\" acoustic homing torpedo. The Fido homed in on I-361‚Ä≤s propeller noises and exploded. The approaching destroyer escort felt a strong underwater shock away, and when she and the destroyer escort arrived on the scene of the sinking they sighted a heavy oil slick and floating debris. It marked the end of I-361, sunk with the loss of all 81 men on board ‚Äî her entire crew of 76 and all five of her embarked kaiten pilots ‚Äî at . On 25 June 1945, the Imperial Japanese Navy declared I-361 to be presumed lost with all hands southeast of Okinawa. She was stricken from the Navy list on 10 August 1945.

It is also known by the longer title The Provok'd Husband: or, a Journey to London. Vanbrugh had worked on a projected play A Journey to London for Cibber, a sharp comedy in the Restoration-style. Unfinished at his death in 1726, Vanbrugh left the manuscript to him.Koon p.112 In need of a new play for the Drury Lane Theatre where he was a manager, Cibber finished it under a new title The Provoked Husband which echoed one of Vanbrugh's most popular works The Provoked Wife. He reworked it substantially, softening the character of Lady Loverule who was renamed Lady Townly, and adding a more conventional happy ending than Vanbrugh had intended.Koon p.113-114 The original cast included Robert Wilks as Lord Townly, Anne Oldfield as Lady Townly, Mary Porter as Lady Grace, John Mills as Manly, Colley Cibber as Sir Francis Wronghead, Sarah Thurmond as Lady Wronghead, Jane Cibber as Jenny, Joe Miller as Moody and Roger Bridgewater as Count Basset. The play was a huge success and enjoyed a lengthy run at the theatre, boosting the finances of the struggling Drury Lane. It appeared to be the hit of the season, only to be eclipsed by the even more dramatic success of John Gay's The Beggar's Opera which opened three weeks later at the rival Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre.Koon p.118 The Provoked Husband was revived frequently over the following century, become a staple part of the repertory in many theatres.

Located in Humboldt Park, a major urban park in the Humboldt Park neighborhood, the statue depicts Alexander von Humboldt, a Prussian polymath and the park's namesake. The statue was dedicated in 1892.  History  The park and surrounding neighborhood were named in honor of Alexander von Humboldt, a Prussian polymath who, among other things, made numerous scientific voyages throughout the Americas during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Despite never having visited Chicago during any of his journeys, he became the park's namesake in 1869. According to Chicago's NPR affiliate, the name was chosen due to \\"ethnic politics,\\" as German Americans made up a significant portion of the neighborhood's population and were considered a growing voting bloc in the politics of Chicago. The monument was payed for by Francis Dewes, a German-born brewer who is also known for the Francis J. Dewes House in Chicago. The statue was dedicated on October 16, 1892. The unveiling ceremony, which saw speeches given in English, German, and Swedish, attracted approximately 20,000 spectators. The bronze figure of Humboldt was sculpted by a German sculptor named Felix G√∂rling and was cast in the Gladenbeck foundry in Berlin. The pedestal was designed and crafted by H.C. Hoffman & Co., a Chicago-based company, using granite imported from Freeport, Maine. Notable speakers at the unveiling included Chicago Mayor Hempstead Washburne and University of Chicago professor Albion Woodbury Small. The statue is one of several of Humboldt erected in the United States during the 1800s, alongside statues in Philadelphia, St. Louis, and the Cleveland Cultural Gardens.  Design  The monument features a bronze sculpture of Humboldt atop a granite pedestal, with the entire height of the monument being approximately . Humboldt is posed as a lecturer, with a flower in his raised right hand and a book in his left hand, which is resting on a tree stump. A globe and other smaller symbols of some of the scientific fields Humboldt was involved in are present near his feet.

It is currently housed at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., which acquired it in June 2007. Background The sculpture was produced in the early part of Duquesnoy's career in Rome. The Fiammingo was sent to study in Italy by his patron Archduke Albert. He settled in Rome in 1618. After the death of his benefactor the archduke (1621), Duquesnoy was forced to carve works in ivory and wood to support himself. In the 1620s, Duquesnoy produced an ivory crucifix as a gift to the pope. It is likely that Duquesnoy produced the Christ Bound at this time. Sculpture The sculpture depicts Christ with his eyes downcast and his body elegantly bent into a precarious and yet balanced pose. The curve of his body might be following the curve of the single piece of tusk from whence this figure was cut. This sculpture is early evidence of Duquesnoy's aesthetic vision, his maniera greca. Similarly to Duquesnoy's Saint Andrew and its Laoco√∂n-like torso, the Christ is here depicted in a way which is reminiscent of Ancient sculpture. The Christ Bound's proportioned, slim and toned body is a fundamental aspect in Duquesnoy's own vision of valuable Ancient Roman and Greek sculpture. The sculpture is housed at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., wherein it is located on the ground floor of the West Building, in Gallery 10.

Production Fred Coe was the producer. He made a pitch to produce a drama on the subject of mental health. Roger O. Hirson was hired to write the teleplay with John Bartlow Martin serving as a consultant on mental health issues. Hirson conducted research at the Columbus State Hospital in Ohio and at St. Vincent's Hospital in New York. To ensure accuracy, Hirson's script was submitted for review to the American Psychiatric Association and the National Association for Mental Health. The production required a year of production time.

They also wished to entirely disrupt the tobacco industry because the colonists used the tobacco trade to fund their war effort against Britain. This complemented existing efforts by the British Royal Navy to seize shipments of tobacco leaving American ports. General Benedict Arnold attempted to bargain with the colonists for their tobacco.

Jefferson did not negotiate with Arnolds or turn over the tobacco. The troops led by Phillips burned about 8,000 hogsheads of tobacco in Petersburg, Manchester, Blandford, and Osborne.

It monitors the treatment of Palestinian prisoners arrested in the West Bank by the occupying power, and provides legal assistance. History Addameer was established in 1992. It defines its aims as twofold:support for Palestinian political prisoners held in Israeli and Palestinian prisons and the provision of \\"free legal aid to political prisoners, advocates their rights at the national and international level, and works to end torture and other violations of prisoners' rights through monitoring, legal procedures and solidarity campaigns\\" Khalida Jarrar, its former director, has been held repeatedly under administrative detention without trial. The director of Addameer since 2006 has been Sahar Francis. IDF raids on Addameer offices The offices of Addameer have been raided, and documentation in their care seized, on three occasions. =2002= The first Israeli raid on Addameer offices was conducted in 2002, during the Israeli invasion of Rtamallah in that year. =2012= The second incident took place in 2012. The timing coincided with the expiry of the annual International Human Rights Day. On 11 December, at approximately 3 am, the IDF conducted raids on the offices of Addameer and two other Palestinian NGOs, and from Addameer's offices 4 computers from the legal and documentation units containing information on prisoners and their cases, a hard drive, a video camera and employees' business cards were confiscated. The soldiers also ripped off and tore up posters of prisoners and hunger strikers pinned on the office walls. In the view of Allam Jarrar of the Palestinian NGO Network, the raid's timing was to seen seen in the context of the United Nations General Assembly's recognition of Palestine as a de facto state two weeks earlier, on 29 November. Executive Director Sahar Francis told Human Rights Watch that video equipment and paper files of prisoner's cases were also missing after the raid According to a military spokesperson, the raids were based on a suspicion that the three NGOs were affilioated with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), though no evidence has been produced to substantiate the claim, and the N¬ßOS themselves deny the assertion. The Israeli Human Rights NGO B'Tselem, also in the name of several other human rights organisations such as Gisha and Yesh Din, issued a strong protest, demanding not only the restitution of the confiscated property but that protection be given to civil society organizations, in particular those engaged in upholding the cause of human rights. Human Rights Watch also demanded that compensation be made for the damage caused. Joe Stork deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch stated: > 'In the absence of warrants or demonstrated military necessity, these raids > are nothing but an unlawful attempt to seriously harm the work of groups > supporting the local population.. The Israeli military needs to justify why > it was absolutely necessary to ransack the offices of Palestinian rights > groups and seize their property.' =2019= At 2 o'clock in the morning of 19 September 2019, an IDF unit broke into the offices of Addameer and after ransacking it, took away, according to the inventory left, 'five laptops, memory cards, three laptop memories, one laptop card and several books'. According to the Al-Haq NGO, the raid and expropriation was in contravention of several principles of international law: private property in such circumstances is protected; and the pillaged items bore no relation to military needs. The loss of the material caused difficulties for the group ar a time when 5,150 Palestinian prisoners, many assisted by Addameer, were incarcerated by Israel, and often in Israel, in contravention again of international law.

Biography  Between 2006-09, Soto Garc√≠a worked as a reporter for WKAQ 580 AM station. He was Moca's public relations director and its head of the office of recreation and sports between 1996-2000. From 2000-2008 he was director of news, journalist and moderator on the WABA 850 AM station in Aguadilla. He holds a degree in marketing from the University of Phoenix in Puerto Rico. Later, he obtained a juris doctor from the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico School of Law, however he has not passed the bar. Soto Garc√≠a then worked as the Senate Chief of Public Affairs under senate president Thomas Rivera Schatz. He currently functions as Secretary of Public Affairs and Political Affairs at the Fortaleza. According to the Governor's Office, he has lead multimillion projects in the private factor and as consultant in federally funded projects. He also worked as Auxiliary Administrator of the Work Development Administration of the Department of Labor.  Comptroller Nomination  On 15 September 2020, Governor Wanda V√°zquez Garced, nominated him to the position of Comptroller of Puerto Rico, in a communication that also stated the nominations of 28 judges, 38 prosecutors and several individuals to other political positions. = Criticism = There has been a notable opposition to his nomination, especially from the majority New Progressive Party, which controls both houses and the executive branch. The requirements for the job are limited to an age minimum of 30, American citizenship and Puerto Rico residency, but not for the person to be a CPA. Doubts have been cast as to his ability for the ten-year, $129,000 a year salary position of comptroller since he is not a CPA. Both the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Carlos \\"Johnny\\" M√©ndez, and the President of its Health Committee, Juan Oscar Morales, announced publicly that Soto Garc√≠a would face difficulties with his confirmation in that body, since the post requires confirmation by both House and Senate. Morales was opposed since he had done an investigation the previous May related to the buying of tests during the COVID-19 Pandemic, and Soto Garc√≠a, as Secretary of Public Affairs and Political Affairs, \\"criticized the investigation into possible acts of corruption.\\" Migdalia Padilla, president of the Senate Treasury Committee, stated that she would vote against Soto Garc√≠a. Popular Democratic Party Senator, Jos√© Luis Dalmau, stated \\"I have an excellent opinion with Mr. Osvaldo,\\" however, for Comptroller, \\"the figure of a CPA has always been sought.\\" The Senate PNP spokesperson, Carmelo R√≠os, stated that he \\"thought the governor made a mistake in naming him\\" before the November elections. R√≠os further stated that the public opinion holds his nomination as \\"a political favor\\", additionally, even if he had worked in the Senate, members of that body might vote differently and they have suggested other political figures such as: Francisco Par√©s Alicea, Secretary of the Treasury; Manuel Torres, Secretary of the Senate; Edwin Garc√≠a Feliciano, former mayor of Camuy; and Javier Jim√©nez, mayor of San Sebasti√°n. Speaker of the House, M√©ndez N√∫√±ez later stated he would provide for public hearings to enable Soto Garc√≠a to \\"convince\\" him, since hwhen he haeard of the nomination he knew that Soto Garc√≠a would not have enough votes for his confirmation. M√©ndez N√∫√±ez would provide for an opinion from the College of Certified Public Accountants of Puerto Rico in the hearings which are set to commence on Monday, September 21. In a radio interview, the president of the College, Rosa M. Rodr√≠guez Ramos, stated that they would \\"support a CPA\\" and \\"could not support him...Osvaldo Garc√≠a Soto.\\" 2020 gubernatorial candidate, Pedro Pierluisi, who defeated governor Wanda V√°zquez for the party nomination, rejected the nomination of Soto Garc√≠a and urged the Legislature to \\"make an exhaustive evaluation of the nominee.\\" Several former Secretaries of the Treasury used social media to express their oppositions. Juan Zaragoza stated that his \\"appointment...is another blow to the already battered government institutions.\\" For her part, Teresita Fuentes, suggested and endorsed the present Secretary, Francisco Par√©s, stating \\"he is a CPA, Secretary of the Treasury, with experience in a prestigious international firm and academic background in accounting.\\" = Response = Soto Garc√≠a has defended his nomination by stating that the Comptroller's office needs \\"a person who would give it a totally different perspective, more investigative.\\" He has also assured that he would bring in more federal funds for the auditors, he is not a CPA, but that the auditors are the one's who work on that area, and that even though he is a member of the New Progressive Party he would \\"point out whoever and whenever, without distinction of persons.\\" For her part, V√°zquez Garced has stated his nomination is not based on \\"politics\\" and other non-CPAs have occupied the post of Comptroller. She rejected the concept that she was \\"screwing\\" Soto Garc√≠a into Comptroller so as to leave a legacy in the government. V√°zquez Garced affirmed that he posseses \\"the moral and professional ethics essential to ensure the proper use of our public resources in the three branches of government.\\" She considered several auditors and even Francisco Par√©s, the present Secretary of the Treasury.

Pakistan's High Commission in Wellington, New Zealand, is concurrently accredited to Samoa. Pakistan also has an honorary consul in Apia. Diplomatic relations Diplomatic relations between Pakistan and Samoa were formally established on 7 March 1983. The relationship has been characterised as cordial; both countries are member states of the United Nations (UN), Commonwealth of Nations and Group of 77, and have interacted with each other at the UN and other multilateral fora on issues of mutual importance. On 1 June 2000, Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf felicitated Samoa's head of state Malietoa Tanumafili II and prime minister Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi on the occasion of Samoa's independence day: In May 2004, Samoa was a member of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group which endorsed Pakistan's readmission into the Commonwealth. In September 2014, Pakistan participated in the Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States (SIDS) hosted by Samoa. On 18 October 2016, Afrasiab Mehdi Hashmi became Pakistan's first High Commissioner to receive concurrent accreditation to Samoa. He presented his credentials to Tui Atua Tupua Tamasese Efi during a ceremony at the head of state's residence in Apia, following a traditional welcome in an  ªava ceremony. He served in the position until October 2017. Hashmi underlined his government's desire to further strengthen the bilateral relationship, while Tupua noted the two sides had forged a \\"close and friendly association\\" in recent years in matters of peace, climate change and sustainable development, all of which were key issues for both governments. Tupua thanked Pakistan for its support to Samoa in the SIDS conference. During his visit, Hashmi held meetings with the prime minister and members of the Samoan Chamber of Commerce, where he focused on improving trade relations. He also donated books covering Pakistan's history and foreign relations to the Samoa Public Library, which were accepted by the chief executive of Samoa's Ministry of Education, Sports and Culture, Karoline Afamasaga-Fuata'i. On 20 October 2016, it was announced that the president of Pakistan had appointed businessman and cricket administrator Tiumalu Geoffrey Clarke as Pakistan's first honorary consul-general in Samoa. According to the High Commissioner, the appointment provided Pakistan a diplomatic presence in Apia and enabled a \\"balance of what we want and desire\\" in the context of Pakistan‚ÄìSamoa relations. Abdul Malik is the current High Commissioner of Pakistan to Samoa. He arrived in Apia on 3 March 2019 and presented his credentials to head of state Tuimalealiifano Va'aletoa Sualauvi II at Vailele. Malik said Pakistan attached \\"great importance\\" to its relations with the South Pacific region, and that it was keen to augment political ties, cultural exchanges and economic interaction with Samoa through its honorary consulate. Tuimalealiifano said the relationship was shaped by mutual respect and cooperation, and acknowledged the shared economic and environmental interests of both countries. Economic relations Bilateral trade between Pakistan and Samoa is limited, and was valued at approximately US$500,000 as of 2018. Pakistan exported $454,000 worth of goods to Samoa, comprising almost entirely seafood commodities such as frozen and fresh fish. This reflected an annual growth rate of 30.4%, increasing from $5,000 in 2001. Samoa's exports to Pakistan in the same period were valued at $42,000, and consisted mainly of gas and liquid flow measuring instruments and thermostats. This constituted an annual increase of 17.2%, from $2,820 in 2003. Samoa is reportedly amongst the tax havens where significant amounts of Pakistani capital is invested using offshore bank accounts. In October 2016, it was reported that Pakistan's Federal Board of Revenue would approach Samoa regarding the sharing of tax information. Samoan authorities notified Pakistan that the details could be shared pursuant to a bilateral tax information exchange agreement, which had not yet been signed but which they were willing to start negotiations on. The process to solemnize an agreement was eventually initiated in 2017. Cultural relations Samoa has a very small Muslim community, which includes some with Pakistani connections. Pakistani citizens visiting Samoa enjoy a visa-on- arrival entry, while Samoan citizens are also entitled to a visa-on-arrival in Pakistan. Sport, including cricket, is one of the areas of mutual interest between both nations. In September 2015, a 13-member Pakistani contingent from four sporting disciplines competed in the fifth Commonwealth Youth Games, which were held in Samoa. Pakistan bagged two silver medals in the tournament.

Alongside fandom academics Alexis Lothian and Robin Anne Reid, she coined the term \\"queer female space\\" in 2007. Early life and education Busse was born on November 29, 1967. She earned her diploma and intermediate examination at the University of Mainz in Germany before travelling to the United States to complete her graduate degrees at Tulane University. Career Upon joining the faculty in the Philosophy department at the University of South Alabama (USA), Busse published her first co-edited book with Karen Hellekson titled Fan Fiction and Fan Communities in the Age of the Internet. The book was a collection of essays on the topic of fan fiction; such as fan culture, fanfiction communities, and fan experiences. Alongside fandom academics Alexis Lothian and Robin Anne Reid, she coined the term \\"queer female space\\" in 2007 to describe the construction of a ‚Äúfannish fantasy space as a place where women can experiment and explore‚Äù within slash fan communities on Livejournal. As a board member of the Organization for Transformative Works (OTW), Busse collaborated with Helleksonto establish the Transformative Works and Cultures academic journal through the OTW. They came to the idea of an academic fan studies journal after witnessing disucsisons for an archive. Together, they found an open-access platform to share their records and picked an editorial board to oversee their research papers prior to print. Busse continued her research into fandom communities and published her second book with Louisa Stein in 2012 titled Sherlock and Transmedia Fandom. Similar to her first book, this was a collection of essays examining the cultural intersections and fan traditions surrounding the Sherlock Holmes fandom. As a result of her scholarship in fanfiction, Busse and Hellekson co- edited The Fan Fiction Studies Reader, a collection of texts surrounding the field fandom, identity, and feminism. They argued that the study of fanfiction was becoming increasingly more important because of the success of fanfiction turned movies, such as the Fifty Shades trilogy series.

In 2019, chronic kidney disease was estimated to have a prevalence of more than 15 percent among adults in the United States, and nearly 100,000 Americans were waiting for a kidney transplant. The purpose of the Advancing American Kidney Health initiative was to improve this situation and thereby reduce healthcare costs by encouraging preventive modes of care, creating incentives to increase the proportion of home dialysis treatment and making kidney transplants available to more patients. Goals The initiative stated three explicit goals: to ensure that 80 percent of patients newly diagnosed with kidney failure would either receive a transplant or at-home dialysis by 2025; to reduce the instances of kidney failure by one fourth by 2030; to make twice as many kidneys available for transplant by 2030. The means to achieve the goals would include a restructuring of payment models within Medicare, thus making home therapy more financially attractive and in-center therapy less so. Public reception The initiative was generally well received at the time of launch, with patient advocates and officials within the United States Department of Health and Human Services commenting that the existing health system for kidney care was overdue for reform and had failed to create incentives for early detection and prevention. The implementation of reforms was slowed down by the impact of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.

He was a quarrelsome individual, and his list of enemies included Jonathan Swift, the publisher George Faulkner and Josiah Hort, Bishop of Kilmore and future Archbishop of Tuam. He was born in Midleton, County Cork in 1689. He was possibly a son or grandson of Thomas Bettesworth, who was appointed one of the original burgesses of the town in 1672. He entered the Middle Temple in 1710, was called to the Irish Bar in 1716, and took silk in 1728. He entered the Irish House of Commons, sitting for Thomastown 1721-7 and for Midleton from 1727 to his death. He was appointed second Serjeant-at-law at the Irish Bar in 1732. Bettesworth was the subject of numerous jeering satires by his enemies. Foremost among these was Jonathan Swift. From the early 1730s Bettesworth, who was a Nonconformist in religion, was strongly associated with the anti-clerical party in the Irish House of Commons, who supported any move to weaken the Church of Ireland, and in particular pressed for the reduction of agricultural tithes.Fabricant and Mahoney 2010 Swift as a result attacked Bettesworth in a vicious anonymous satire \\"The Booby Bettesworth\\". Swift attacked Bettesworth's apparent ignorance of the law, stating that he was one \\"who knows in law nor text, nor margent (margin)\\". Swift also commented on his inability to make any money from his practice, and ridiculed Bettesworth's habit of referring to all his acquaintance as \\"brother\\" (although this was a common practice among Nonconformists at the time). He was particularly scathing about any comparison between Bettesworth and his \\"brother\\" (i.e. fellow Serjeant-at-law) Henry Singleton, whom Swift greatly admired. Bettesworth, infuriated, is said to have spent ¬£1200 in trying to discover the author. He called on Swift at his home, demanded he admit his authorship, and according to Swift threatened him with \\"revenge\\". Swift said that Bettesworth, who had himself some claim to be a poet, threatened simply to use his pen, but some of Swift's friends claimed that Bettesworth threatened to stab him, or, according to Laetitia Pilkington,Pilkington Vol.1 p.473 to cut his ears off, and his friends pledged to defend him against attack. Fabricant and Mahoney 2010 Swift, undeterred, published a further satire on Bettesworth: \\"The Yahoo's Overthrow\\". His antipathy to Bettesworth and another old enemy, Richard Tighe, MP for Newtownards and member of the Privy Council of Ireland (\\"that puppy pair of Dicks\\" as Swift called them), did not lessen with the years. Scott 1829 Vol.2 p.281 Josiah Hort, Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh, a former enemy of Swift but now on friendly terms with him, also wrote his own satire on Bettesworth, \\"A new proposal for the better regulation and improvement of quadrille\\". He proposed that all disputes about the popular card game quadrille be referred to Betteswworth for arbitration, but, since Bettesworth's judgment was not much regarded, Hort humorously suggested that there be a right of appeal to the \\"Upright Man\\", a wooden figure which hung in Essex Street in Dublin city centre. It was printed by the publisher George Faulkner. Faulkner was committed to prison for libel on an MP, being released after two days. In 1741 Bettesworth was sitting as an extra judge of assize (a task regularly performed by the Irish serjants-at-law at the time) when he caught the gaol fever and died.

Prior to the building of the M4 motorway flyover through the centre of the town in the 1960s, it was in the centre of a residential area, but it is now dominated by junction 40 of the motorway. The land was originally donated by C. R. M. Talbot, MP, the owner of the Margam Abbey estate, as a church for local people who could not get to the abbey itself to worship. The church was built in 1827 by the Shrewsbury architect Edward Haycock Sr., with William Bruce Knight as its first vicar, and fell within the parish of Margam, as a chapel of ease to Margam Abbey. It had a capacity of 500. After the building of St Theodore's Church, Port Talbot, Holy Cross became a subsidiary of the new parish of Taibach. In 1903 Holy Cross was upgraded, with G. E. Halliday as architect, to bring it up to the standard of a parish church, and a rood screen was added. The parents of the actor Anthony Hopkins were married at the church in 1936. Closure The church closed at the end of December 2008 after part of the ceiling collapsed. It was declared redundant by the Archbishop of Wales, Barry Morgan, in 2009. The cemetery contains several war graves in the care of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. A proposal to turn the church into a private residence met with opposition from those with relatives buried in the churchyard. It was then proposed to convert the building into a chapel of rest instead. The chapel was taken over by a local funeral director in 2016.

Life Overd was born in Langport in 1838. Her parents were Elizabeth (n√©e Suttiett) and Charles Weaver. She was brought up by her father's mother as her own mother died when she was young. She worked in agriculture from a child including stripping willow saplings. The wood could be used for basket work. She was a keen singer who would entertain drinkers with local songs. She came to the notice of Cecil Sharp in 1904 who heard of her skill at folk singing. Sharp had already met local singers Lucy White and Louie Hooper. Sharp was Principal of the Hampstead Conservatoire of Music. Overd met Cecil Sharp and is reputed to have said Lor, girls, here's my beau come at last! in reply to his interest. Sharp enthused about her singing and transcribed many of her songs. \\"Six Pretty Maidens\\" in 1904 from Emma Overd transcribed by Cecil Sharp Sharp's income was derived after 1905 largely from lecturing and publishing folk music. Overd's songs Bruton Town, Wraggle-Taggle Gipsies, Sweet Kitty and Geordie were included in the first volume of Sharp's and Marson's Folk Songs from Somerset which was published in 1905. Her songs The Crabfish, Briery Bush and New Year's Song were in his later volumes. Sharpand Overd met five times over the next eleven years and Overd introduced him to other folk singers she knew. After 1909 she was given an old age pension which allowed her to buy a beer each week at Langport's Railway Hotel where she would frequently sing. William died in 1914. Overd died a widow in Langport in 1928 and she was buried in Curry Rivel but the precise location is unknown.

During the massacre, soldiers from the Atonal Battalion attacked and killed four Dutch journalists and a disputed number of guerrillas from the Farabundo Mart√≠ National Liberation Front (FMLN).  Background  On 15 October 1979, the Salvadoran Army overthrew the government of Carlos Humberto Romero in a bloodless coup d'√©tat. The military established the Revolutionary Government Junta which governed the country from 18 October 1979 until the democratization of El Salvador on 2 May 1982. During the junta's rule, Far- right paramilitaries and death squads operated in the country and terrorized the civilian population. The paramilitaries and death squads targeted rural peasants, journalists, and human rights workers, labeling them as guerrillas and co-combatants of the Farabundo Mart√≠ National Liberation Front (FMLN).  Dutch journalists  Photo of Koos Koster from 1973. On 24 February 1982, four Dutch journalists arrived at the Hotel Alameda in San Salvador in preparations to do reporting on the ongoing Salvadoran Civil War. The journalists were working for Interkerkelijke Omroep Nederland (IKON), a Dutch public broadcaster. The Dutch journalists were: *Koos Koster (nl) (9 January 1936 ‚Äì 17 March 1982), producer *Jan Kuiper (19 March 1942 ‚Äì 17 March 1982), director *Joop Willemsen (31 March 1937 ‚Äì 17 March 1982), cameraman *Hans ter Laag (? ‚Äì 17 March 1982), sound technician The journalists were arrested by the Treasury Police on 11 March for making contact with FMLN guerrillas. The were questioned for around four to five hours and then released. Koster later made remarks of his arrest saying, \\"it was just another way for the military to intimidate us into discontinuing our reports on El Salvador.\\" A few days later, the Maximiliano Hern√°ndez Mart√≠nez Anti-Communist Brigade, a far-right death squad name after former President Maximiliano Hern√°ndez Mart√≠nez, published a list of 35 journalists they intended to kill for being \\"Soviet- Cuban-Sandinist accomplices,\\" but none of the Dutch journalists were on the list. The fact that non of the men were on the list convinced Koster to continue with his team's reporting despite the others being concerned about the situation. The team planned to head for Chalatenango, an area that was mostly held by the guerrillas, on Wednesday 17 March to film the fighting in the area.  Massacre  The journalists left the hotel for Chalatenango at 2:00pm local time on 17 March. They picked up an FMLN commander, \\"Commander √ìscar,\\" and a child soldier, \\"Rub√©n,\\" who was their guide for the trip in San Salvador. At around 4pm, the crew stopped at a bridge colloquially called \\"the Golden Bridge,\\" which marked the border between government and guerrilla territory, and they filmed themselves with the soldiers guarding the bridge. When the crew passed the El Para√≠so barracks, they noticed a jeep began to follow them but it eventually went away. At around 5pm, the journalists and their guide turned off the main road and drove up a road called Calle Santa Rita connecting El Para√≠so to Cant√≥n Piedras Gordas, Santa Rita, and San Rafael, where they met 3 more guerrillas named \\"Mart√≠n,\\" \\"Carlos,\\" and \\"Tello,\\" after which, their driver, Armin Friedrich Wertz, returned to San Salvador since they planned to stay with the guerrillas for several days. The 9 men walked into the jungle, but they were ambushed by the army with 8 of the being killed. \\"Mart√≠n\\" was the only survivor. According to Thomas Buergenthal, a member of the United Nations' Truth Commission for El Salvador, \\"the military waited for them and basically executed them.\\" Their driver was notified of the massacre at 7am the next day. The bodies of the journalists were returned to San Salvador.  Aftermath  A memorial in Amsterdam for the 4 journalists and 40,000 victims of the civil war. News of the massacre was broadcast in the Netherlands on 18 March which sparked demonstrations calling for the removal of the junta. A memorial for the journalists and the 40,000 victims of the civil war was created in Amsterdam on 16 April. The Salvadoran Army stated that there was not an ambush or a massacre, but instead, the journalists were caught in crossfire between the army and the guerrillas. Jos√© Napole√≥n Duarte, the President of the junta, visited the site and stated on 25 March, \\"it was not a premeditated act, in my opinion, it was an accident.\\" The Dutch conducted an investigation into the incident and came to the conclusion that it was in fact a massacre. They also discovered that US soldiers were present at the base the day of the massacre. The United Nations conducted their own investigation in 1993 and identified Colonel Mario Reyes Mena as the man who ordered the ambush. The Truth Commission stated that the attack violated international human rights law and international humanitarian law. However, due to an amnesty bill passed in 1993, Reyes Mena was never arrested nor charged with the massacre. Bruce Hazelwood, an American military trainer present at the barracks that day, confirmed that the army knew about the meeting between the journalists and the guerrillas and that they planned an ambush. He confirmed Reyes Mena ordered the attack. A new Dutch organization, ZEMBLA, tracked down Reyes Mena using declassified US documents. Reyes Mena left El Salvador for the United States in 1984 where he since lived in Virginia. Journalists interviewed him at his home on 24 September 2018 but he defended himself stating that both Duarte and the US conducted investigations and found no evidence of him ordering the massacre. He accused the journalists of never telling the truth and being part of a communist conspiracy. In 2016, the 1993 amnesty law was repealed after it was found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. Since then, the Fundaci√≥n Comunic√°ndonos and the Salvadoran Association for Human Rights (ASDEHU) have been pushing for justice for the Dutch journalists. Raquel de Guevara from the Human Rights Advocate of El Salvador announced that they would also be seeking justice for the journalists. Dutch civilians have also wanted Reyes Mena to be prosecuted. Those seeking justice remain hopeful since Jos√© Guillermo Garc√≠a, another Salvadoran war criminal, was extradited to El Salvador in 2016. However, since 2019, legislators have been pushing for a new amnesty bill.

History  When work on the Riihim√§ki‚ÄìSaint Petersburg railway began in 1868, Lappila was one of the headquarters for workers along with Riihim√§ki. The nearby village of Tillola became site for the third field hospital founded for the railway workforce, after those in Oitti and Lahti. The class IV station building was completed in 1869; it was however replaced by a smaller barracks-style building in 1967. Industry began to settle in Lappila after the arrival of the railway; facilities founded include two sawmills (1897, 1908) as well as brick factories and a furniture workshop. After the last sawmill closed in 1959, Lappila's population number took a downturn after peaking in 1960 at over 700. Lappila was home to 283 inhabitants in 2018.Urban settlements by population and population density, 2018. Statistics Finland. On 18 October 1961, the Railway Administration made the decision to purchase a set of 800 concrete sleepers from abroad, the first of their kind in Finland; in July 1962, they were installed on the section of track between Lappila and J√§rvel√§. The trials were successful, and on 12 June 1963, the first batch of concrete sleepers from Finnish manufacturers was ordered. Lappila became an unmanned station in 1976, its freight traffic was discontinued in 1981, and its railyard disassembled in 1987.

The Court held 8‚Äì1 that an arbitration clause in a contract the plaintiff David Heller had signed with Uber was unconscionable, and hence unenforceable. As a result, it held that Heller's proposed class action lawsuit against Uber could go forward.  Background  David Heller was a driver with Uber Eats in Ontario. As part of his engagement with Uber, Heller executed a standard form contract with the company. Among other things, Heller's contract with Uber purported to require that Heller pursue arbitration against Uber in the courts of the Netherlands, according to the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce. The cost of filing such a claim would amount to approximately . Ontario's Employment Standards Act imposes certain requirements on employers operating within Ontario, including a minimum wage of per hour. Heller brought a class action lawsuit against Uber under the Employment Standards Act, on his behalf and on behalf of Uber drivers working in Ontario since 2012. Arguing that he and other members of the proposed class were Uber's employees, not independent contractors, Heller claimed he was owed minimum wage, overtime, and vacation pay. The claims of the class as a whole totalled approximately .  Lower courts  Uber brought a motion to stay Heller's class action pending resolution of arbitration in the Netherlands. The Ontario Superior Court of Justice, the court of first instance in the action, granted the stay. The Court of Appeal for Ontario reversed the motion judge's decision, holding that the contract which purported to require arbitration was unconscionable. According to Peter Quon, the Court of Appeal's decision was the first in which a Canadian court had found an arbitration clause unconscionable.  Decision  In an 8‚Äì1 decision, the Court held that the arbitration clause in Heller's contract with Uber was unconscionable. Further, the majority held that the contract was void because it attempted to contract out of the Employment Standards Act. As a result, the Court allowed Heller's class action lawsuit against Uber to proceed to trial. Justice Russell Brown, in a concurring opinion, argued that the arbitration clause was unenforceable because it effectively denied Heller access to justice and was therefore contrary to public policy. Uber Technologies did not settle the question of whether Heller and other members of the proposed class were in fact employees. Rather, it established only that the arbitration clause in Heller's contract with Uber was unenforceable in Ontario, and that Heller could pursue his complaint against Uber in Ontario courts.  Aftermath  In response to the decision in Uber Technologies, Uber stated that its contracts with Canadian drivers would be modified in accordance with the ruling.  Analysis  According to Michael Geist, a professor at the University of Ottawa Faculty of Law, Uber Technologies will influence the use of arbitration clauses in online contracts generally. Professor Jassmine Girgis of the University of Calgary Faculty of Law argued that the version of the doctrine of unconscionability adopted in Uber Technologies is too expansive, and does not provide sufficient guidance to lower courts. Professor Alan Bogg of the University of Bristol, calling Uber Technologies a \\"momentous victory\\" for Heller, suggested that the decision \\"represents a powerful countermovement against the use of arbitration clauses in employment contracts\\". Tamar Meshel of the University of Alberta Faculty of Law argued that the decision indicates a need for Canadian provinces to reassess whether employment issues ought to be subject to statutes governing the use of arbitration.

Axelrad (born October 22, 1938) is an American Reform rabbi, author, educator, and community leader. He fostered the American Jewish counterculture of the 1960s-1980s. He also served as Jewish chaplain at Brandeis University and Executive Director of its B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation from 1965 to 1999.  Life and career  Albert Sidney Axelrad was born in Brooklyn in 1938. He attended the Yeshivah of Flatbush and then earned a BA in sociology at Columbia University. He received an MA and, in 1965, rabbinic ordination from Hebrew Union College‚ÄìJewish Institute of Religion in New York. As Hillel director at Brandeis, Axelrad pioneered a number of programs that were adopted widely in American Jewish life, leading one student to dub him a \\"Jewish impresario.\\" The annual Jewish Arts Festival introduced there became a part of Hillel programming around North America. Under Axelrad's leadership, the Berlin Chapel, the Jewish chapel at Brandeis, for several years housed the office of the young Jewish counterculture's quarterly magazine Response: A Contemporary Jewish Review, which had been founded by Jewish students in New York in 1967. His commitment to pluralism in Jewish communal life earned him widespread respect, even among groups for whom his religious and political views were anathema. One official of the central Hillel Foundation organization described Axelrad in the 1980's as \\"not a Hillel director; the Hillel director.\\" Axelrad was one of the founders in 1968 of Havurat Shalom in Somerville, Massachusetts, which was originally envisioned as a \\"community seminary\\" to offer a new model of rabbinic training. The Brandeis student \\"egalitarian minyan\\" prayer groups, with Axelrad's active involvement, were among the earliest spinoffs of the new approach to Jewish prayer developed by Havurat Shalom. When Axelrad understood that many adult members of the university community, especially women, had not celebrated their bar/bat mitzvah decades earlier, Axelrad arranged for the first \\"adult bar and bat mitzvah\\" training and celebrations in the early 1970s., reprinted in Meditations of a Maverick Rabbi, pp. 61-64. He and his students and friends helped popularize the practice in all denominations of North American Judaism. Beginning in the first years of his rabbinate, Axelrad advocated for rabbinic officiation at marriages of a Jew and a non-Jew, although only under limited circumstances. Noting that supportive non-Jewish spouses could be involved in raising Jewish children, he proposed that rabbis should be understanding of a non-Jewish partner's reluctance to convert to Judaism for any of a variety of reasons. For couples willing to raise Jewish children, Axelrad proposed that the cooperation and support of a rabbi at the outset of the marriage could be crucial in their decision to do so.  Advocacy and other interests  Arriving at Brandeis as American involvement in the Vietnam War reached its peak, Axelrad became involved in advising students considering seeking conscientious objector status in the Selective Service military draft system. He was an active member of the Jewish Peace Fellowship. Axelrad came to describe himself not as a \\"pacifist\\" but as a \\"pacifoid,\\" doing everything possible to avoid war, but also recognizing that in extreme cases war may be necessary., reprinted in Meditations of a Maverick Rabbi, pp. 129-142, and in Peace, Justice, and Jews: Reclaiming Our Tradition, ed. Murray Polner and Stefan Merken (New York: Bunim & Bannigan, 2007), pp. 215-219. Another area of Axelrad's political advocacy was in the movement for divestment from South Africa as a way of pressuring the government there to abandon apartheid. He remained troubled by the anti-Israel bias of many who shared his divestment position. From 1973 through 1977, Breira, the first national Jewish organization to advocate for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel, counted Axelrad among its leaders. In the 1970s and 1980s, Axelrad was involved in the plight of Jews in the Soviet Union, who were unable to practice Judaism and also unable to emigrate. He made Brandeis University a center of activity in the Soviet Jewry Movement of those years. His 1978 trip to the Soviet Union, the first of two such journeys to visit refuseniks, is documented in a brief book he wrote, Refusenik: Voices of Struggle and Hope. He visited again, with a rabbinic colleague from Boston, in February, 1991. Axelrad's interest in nonviolent resistance to tyranny led him to focus on the biblical midwives of the Hebrew women of Egypt, Shifra and Puah. He publicized one of two visits to Brandeis by Avital Sharansky during her efforts to free her husband Anatoly Shcharansky (later Natan Sharansky) from imprisonment in the Soviet Union led Axelrad to create the Shifra and Puah Award, presented annually by Brandeis Hillel. After his retirement from Brandeis, Axelrad served as the founding director of the Center for Spiritual Life and adjunct professor of religion at Emerson College in Boston, and as a part-time chaplain at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear, a specialty hospital in Boston.

In the club's first season, chairman Kristian Pedersen primarily served as the head coach and has later also took over the coaching duty briefly in connection with a suspension for the coach. Before the start of the 2006 season, however, the club's board hired a paid coach to optimise training and ensure another promotion. The club's first coach was Ren√© Christensen, who was picked up from a coaching job at F√∏rslev IF. The club's first team promoted twice in its first two seasons and membership constantly increased during the first two years, which meant that in 2006, the club established a second team and later a third team.

Inspired by Dr. Kenneth H. Cooper's 1968 book on aerobic exercise, she created for women an aerobic dance routine to music in 1969 in Puerto Rico, teaching U.S. Air Force wives. She expanded this concept into a teaching method and studio franchise, Aerobic Dancing Inc., that rose to 1,500 locations and 4,000 instructors teaching 170,000 students in 1981 at its peak. The Lotto shoe company came out with the \\"Jacki\\" signature aerobics shoe in 1982. Eight years later, after experiencing declining profits because of competition, Sorensen changed her business name to Jacki's, Inc., and soon integrated the new step aerobics style. Jacki's continues today with instructors and studios in the U.S., Australia and Japan. Called the \\"mother of aerobic dancing\\", Sorensen served on the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports for six years in the 1970s, and was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award by that body in 2012.

Sorensen took dancing classes as a child and by age 12 she was teaching. To master one routine combining tap dance with skipping rope, she skipped rope frequently until she could breathe comfortably at the same time. She danced professionally while still in her teens. She danced the hula at 16, appeared in an Oakland beauty contest at 17, and danced in a Gay '90s chorus line troupe at 18. She found that professional dancers needed to be taller than her height of , so she enrolled in university. In June 1962, she competed as Miss Southern Alameda County in the Miss California beauty pageant, winning the dancing category.Several newspaper clippings about the 1962 beauty pageant:  She met Neil A.

Sorensen accompanied her husband to his next assignment at Ramey Air Force Base in Puerto Rico in 1969.

She studied recent exercise publications including Kenneth H. Cooper's 1968 book Aerobics, which recommended jogging for a healthy heart. Sorensen took his Cooper test and scored \\"excellent\\" even though she had never jogged; she realized that her dancing was an equivalent exercise to jogging. She wrote to Cooper and he encouraged her, saying her idea of a dance-based exercise was better, since jogging by itself was not interesting enough for most women to maintain a steady regimen. He recommended that she administer his test to her students, to see how far they could run in 12 minutes. She later said that Cooper's book \\"changed my life...

They‚Äôre worrying about the little muscles in their inner thighs, when they should be worrying about the most important muscle ‚Äì their hearts.\\" Sorensen reassured her students that they would not be judged by their performance or their style. She avoided large mirrors so that the students could feel the exercises internally rather than be distracted by external appearances. Classes were conducted with Sorensen facing away from the students, allowing them to soften the more challenging moves without being scolded. She tested her students regularly to check pulse rate and breathing, and all of them improved after 12 weeks. Agreeing to the request of Air Force producers, she put together a television show called Aerobic Dancing on a TV station in San Juan, recording eight broadcasts per visit because it was a long drive from Ramey AFB. She found that her students reduced their waistlines but they did not usually lose weight. In 1970, Neil finished his military service, and began selling aviation insurance in South Orange, New Jersey. Before joining him, Sorensen recorded more programs of Aerobic Dancing in Puerto Rico to finish the series. Searching around New Jersey, Sorensen looked for opportunities to teach her aerobic dance classes, but was turned down everywhere until she found a friendly church basement YMCA class in Maplewood, teaching six women, starting in January 1971. These women loved the 12-week program and brought their friends, helping Sorensen slowly pick up a following, finding more students at other YMCA locations, park recreation programs, and through word-of-mouth. Some of her workshops were at Bloomfield College and Seton Hall University, where she also took graduate classes in exercise physiology. When business picked up, Sorensen found herself teaching 25 classes a week in New Jersey. She started running most evenings to calm herself for sleep, four miles in each session, four or five times a week. She ran the 26.2-mile (42.2 km) Atlantic City Marathon organized by the Road Runners Club of America on October 31, 1971, coming in second place in the women's division, behind Nina Kuscsik. Sorensen's elapsed time was about 3.5 hours. Working toward a master's degree, Sorensen conducted research on aerobic exercise at Seton Hall and at East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania. She also served as Seton Hall's women's intramural sports director, and as assistant director of recreation. She gave a demonstration of aerobic dancing at the National Intramural Association convention in April 1971, and Albert \\"Sonny\\" Rooker, head of the Texas State Intramural program, asked Sorensen to show her methods to Texas educators. Over the next two years, Sorensen trained and certified more than 200 aerobic dancing instructors in Texas, for which she was accorded the Texas Honor Award by the Governor's Commission on Physical Fitness ‚Äì she was the first non-Texan to receive this award. Rooker introduced her to C. Carson \\"Casey\\" Conrad, the executive director of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. Conrad invited Sorensen to travel the U.S. as a clinician, bringing her methods to teachers and students at every level from elementary school through college. Neil Sorensen's job was transferred across the country, and the couple arranged to move to Northridge, California. To prepare for her absence from New Jersey, Sorensen incorporated as Aerobic Dancing, Inc., and she trained five of her first six students to take over. These \\"clinicians\\" started their own aerobic dance classes under her banner. Classes were held within rented spaces such as community centers and gyms. Her curriculum was based on the student learning one extended dance routine for 12 weeks, consisting of two or three sessions lasting a total of 90 to 120 minutes per week. There was a new routine every 12 weeks, with themed choreography to new music selections. Sorensen compared this to professional dancers learning a Broadway show, which was more fun than rote exercise. Sorensen required her clinicians to meet an exacting set of standards: they must not be smokers or drinkers, they must maintain their weight within a narrow optimal range relative to height, their hearts must be strong as measured by resting and active heart rates, they must be able to run in 12 minutes, they must memorize all of the current dance routines, and they must represent the company while wearing pantyhose under white polyester dance shorts of Sorensen's design. There was no maximum age restriction. In 1973, Sorensen created a \\"Sheer Energy\\" fitness program for L'eggs pantyhose employees. After moving to California, Sorensen toured American schools on the President's program eight times a year, and in mid-1973 she was hired by L'eggs pantyhose company to formulate and administer an exercise regimen for 600 women who drove for L'eggs and stocked the pantyhose in stores. L'eggs was rolling out the Sheer Energy line in the fall, and Sorensen created a \\"Sheer Energy\\" aerobic dancing fitness program for the fleet of distributors. In between President's Council responsibilities, she visited 26 cities over the course of three months, teaching her fitness program to L'eggs representatives. Also in 1973, Sorensen began recording a series of exercise records for schoolchildren. She attended a cardiovascular health clinic in San Diego given by doctors John Boyer and Fred Kasch, authors of the 1968 book Adult Fitness. Inspired by them, Sorensen opened a new Aerobic Dancing center in San Diego. By May 1975, the company was so successful that Neil shifted careers to manage the business side of Aerobic Dancing, Inc. (ADI). The San Diego location was very active locally, sponsoring a dance-a-thon to fund Special Olympics, a walkathon for the American Heart Association, and a benefit to rebuild the Old Globe Theatre. By 1977, about 30,000 people had taken classes in Sorensen's Aerobic Dancing. She had formulated 150 different dance routines to keep it interesting for her students, the music ranging from ragtime to contemporary pop and dance. By 1984, the number of routines had passed 1,000. In September 1979, Sorensen published Aerobic Dancing, promoting it on radio and TV with a book tour through the U.S. Many new students were attracted through classes held in YMCA nonprofits. One year later, she put out an exercise record for adults on vinyl LP. In 1981, ADI reached its peak, counting 1,500 locations, 70 clinicians (supervisor instructors), and 4,000 certified instructors. Some 170,000 students were enrolled, including ones in Japan and Australia. After this, the business steadily lost instructors because it paid an hourly wage rather than allowing entrepreneurship of its franchisees, and because it abandoned the popular YMCA base for dedicated dance studios. ADI was losing ground to Judi Missett's Jazzercise franchises and to the new crop of home video releases inspired by Jane Fonda's Workout in 1982. Carol Woody designed the dancer logo Sorensen lent her image to Kraft Foods reduced-calorie salad dressing, appearing in magazine advertisements in 1982, the ad including a Kraft proof- of-purchase offer to obtain the Aerobic Dancing book at a discount. She promoted shoes by Lotto Sport Italia: the $38.95 \\"Jacki\\" signature model made in 1982 specifically for aerobic dancing. Sorensen kept her business operating through the 1980s, releasing another book in 1983, keeping the company headquarters to Northridge while she and her husband moved to Malibu. Her annual music licensing fees were $70,000. Men's routines and classes were added in 1981, and the company reported 28 male instructors among the hundreds of women. Sorensen's husband Neil started exercising for the first time with her in 1983, wearing a t-shirt that said, \\"Jane Fonda Does Not Work Out Here.\\" Around this time, Sorensen removed the requirement that ADI instructors wear pantyhose. Eunice Kennedy Shriver (left) accepts a $4,000,000 check from Sorensen to benefit Special Olympics in 1982 Sorensen trademarked \\"Jacki's, Inc.\\" in 1990.Sorensen, Jacki (May 18, 1990).

The logo's silhouette of a dancer was designed by Carol Woody, and purchased by the company; it is used on branded clothing and exercise gear. Sorensen introduced StrongStep by 1992, her take on step aerobics. Today, Sorensen's aerobic dancing style is taught in Jacki's Dance and StrongStep classes in Australia, Japan and the U.S. Honors and legacy Sorensen won the Texas Honor Award in August 1974 for \\"outstanding contribution to fitness\\" in Texas. She served the White House for six years in the 1970s as a clinician associated with the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. She served the Women's Sports Foundation on their advisory committee starting in 1978. In 1979 she signed a letter urging the president to support Title IX legislation which would ensure girls receive the same physical education opportunities as boys. LeRoy Neiman painted a portrait of Sorensen in motion, and the painting was published on the cover of the Fall 1981 issue of Sorensen's Aerobic Dancing in-house magazine. She was honored by the IDEA Health and Fitness Association with their first Lifetime Fitness Achievement Award in 1985. The National Fitness Hall of Fame inducted Sorensen in 2007. In 2012, Sorensen was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the President's Council on Sports, Fitness, and Nutrition.

Located in the city's Lincoln Park, the monument was installed in 1952, having been completed several years prior in 1939.  History  The monument honoring Alexander Hamilton was proposed by philanthropist Kate Sturges Buckingham before her death in 1937. Her will included a $1 million earmark to the Art Institute of Chicago for monument's construction. Buckingham felt that Hamilton was an underappreciated figure in the creation of the United States, and before her death, she commissioned sculptor John Angel to design a statue of Hamilton and architect Eliel Saarinen to create an column that the statue would rest on. The statue was completed in 1939, while the column idea was never executed. Following this, the statue would remain in storage for over 12 years due to bronze shortages during World War II. The monument was dedicated in Lincoln Park in 1952, accompanied by a large plinth behind it made of limestone and granite designed by Samuel A. Marx. However, this plinth was later removed in October 1993, and shortly thereafter the monument was placed on a new, red granite pedestal.

He was promoted to the rank of Inspecteur, working in Privas with considerable distinction. But, as soon as his years of service gave him the right to retire, he retired in order to collect plants and study botany. From 1884 until his death in 1905 he was a member of the Soci√©t√© Botanique de France. In retirement he first lived in Nice and then moved to his property in Plascassier, where, in addition to his house, a number of buildings were reserved exclusively for his herbarium and his library. Due to his unceasing labor, both the herbarium and library acquired considerable value, with many specimens and documents excellently presented and classified. His herbarium and library were made available to botanists with the greatest liberality. Vidal's botanical activity is reflected almost entirely in the correspondence he maintained with many distinguished botanists, such as Charles Flahault, Julien Foucaud, Antoine Le Grand (1839‚Äì1905), and Casimir Arvet-Touvet. In his last years, Vidal worked closely with Ludovic Legr√© (1838‚Äì1904). These two botanists gathered materials for the publication of a flora of Provence but the work was not ready for publication when they died. Vidal greatly contributed to the knowledge of the flora of the Maritime Alps through his numerous collections and distributions of plants from this region. He also took an active part in the organization of the Soci√©t√© Botanique de France's Barcelonnette session. Upon his death at age 70, Vidal's will endowed the City of Nice with the valuable collections of his library and herbarium, together with the money necessary for their installation and maintenance.

Precipitation runoff from this mountain drains into tributaries of the Colorado River. The nearest town is Moab, to the northwest, and the nearest higher neighbor is Mount Peale, to the south. The mountain's name honors Rudolf E. Mellenthin (1884‚Äì1918), forest ranger of La Sal National Forest, who was shot to death near this peak on August 23, 1918, while attempting to apprehend two draft evaders. This geographical feature's name was officially adopted in 1932 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. Climate Spring and fall are the most favorable seasons to visit Mount Mellenthin. According to the K√∂ppen climate classification system, it is located in a Cold semi-arid climate zone, which is defined by the coldest month having an average mean temperature below 32 ¬∞F (0 ¬∞C), and at least 50% of the total annual precipitation being received during the spring and summer.

The translation is not unique as an Andalusian translation of a Christian text into Arabic, but few others survive as they were no longer preserved once Arabic ceased to be widely read in the Iberian peninsula. In the assessment of Ann Christys, the unique manuscript of the Arabic Orosius is now 'their most important representative.'  Origins  Both the content and the presence of Arabic words of Hispanic origin suggest that the translation was produced in al-Andalus, but the date of its origin is uncertain. Medieval historians speculated about its origin, suggesting that it was by ·∏§af·π£ ibn AlbƒÅr, noted for his translation into Arabic of the Psalms, and associated with the court of al-·∏§akam II, but while this may not be wrong, there is no convincing evidence to support these claims.  Style  According to Ann Christys, > the translators were obviously struggling with their material. Orosius' > convoluted style was difficult to understand, and they may have been working > with a corrupt version of the Histories. They took great liberties with the > text, abbreviating and transposing it and sprinkling their effort with > disclaimers, such as 'we have suppressed this, but through a love of > conciseness and not wanting to go on at length'. They left out almost the > whole of Orosius' prefaces to Books 5, 6 and 7. Some sections may have been > omitted because they were incomprehensible. Others were glossed extensively. > There are many spelling mistakes, particularly in the names of places and > people, although some of these may be the fault of later copyists. There are > many instances of muslim influence on the text, which begins with the > bismillah, the opening words of the Qur æan. The clearest example of > Arabicizing is the presentation of personal names in their Arabic form X ibn > Y This necessitated the invention of names for the forgotten fathers of the > heroes of antiquity. The founder of Rome became Romulus ibn Marcus ... > Emperors were almost always made the son of their predecessor. Some of the > biblical characters were given the forms of their names as they appear in > the Qur æan. Mount Ararat, where the Ark came to rest, was identified with > Mount Judi, according to islamic belief. A quotation from the verse of Virgil was rendered into Arabic verse. There are many additions to Orosius's material, many of which could have come from the works of Isidore of Seville, particularly his Chronicle.  Manuscript  The text is known from one, paper manuscript, Columbia University library MS X-893 712 H, of 129 pages. The manuscript is thought to be missing a couple of pages from the beginning and its contents list shows that it is missing several pages from the end, which moreover once extended Orosius's history as far as the Umayyad conquest of Hispania in 711. The origin of the manuscript is uncertain: somewhere in Hispania or North Africa (more likely the latter), perhaps from the thirteenth or fourteenth century (again, more likely the latter). Both the translation and the surviving manuscript could have been made for either a Muslim or Christian audience: the manuscript contains both a gloss in Latin, suggesting a Christian reader, and glosses on two folios in Arabic criticising Christian belief.Ann Christys, Christians in al-Andalus (711-1000) (Abingdon: Routledge, 2002), .  Influence  The translation was influential on Arabic historians, especially Ibn Khald≈´n, who was the only Muslim historian to quote from it extensively.

It was likely cast in the 1630s, but certainly before 1636, when an engraving of the sculpture was produced in Rome. The bronze is currently part of the private collection of the Liechtenstein Museum in Vienna. Another bronze by Duquesnoy of about the same size, and dating to the same period, the Apollo and Cupid, is likewise housed at the Liechtenstein Museum. Background The sculpture was commissioned from Duquesnoy by Vincenzo Giustiniani, a frequent commissioner for Duquesnoy and a friend of his. In the 1630s, Giustiniani helped Duquesnoy finishing one of his masterpieces (the Saint Andrew) by advancing Duquesnoy 300 scudi for a sculpture of the Virgin he commissioned from the Fiammingo. Giustiniani was of Greek origin, and a lover of Ancient sculpture and Greek art. He therefore was a supporter of a revival of the Greek style, and found in Duquesnoy (perhaps the most prominent exponent of the group of traditionalist artists in Rome) and his Greek Ideal a perfect artist to patronize. His commission of the Mercury (or Hermes) from Duquesnoy emphasizes Giustiniani's enthusiasm for Duquesnoy's maniera greca and the revival of the Greek style. Background According to Giovanni Pietro Bellori, the sculpture was originally designed as a pendant to a bronze of Hercules in possession of Giustiniani. In Bellori's Vita delli musei, said Herlucs, Duquesnoy's Mercury, and a sculputre of Athena are described as the highlights of Giustiniani collection. In a 1638 inventory, the Hercules and Duquesnoy's Mercury are reported as standing side by side on the same table. Mercury his standing up, resting his right hand on a tree stump while gracefully bending his body to the right. He is bending his knee to the left in elegant pose. Mercury leans back to look at an infant putto tying wings at his feet. However, the original cupid, or amorino, is now lost. Duquesnoy's Mercury testifies to his vision and own interpretation of valuable Greek sculpture. Among Duquesnoy's precepts, there were the toned slimness and the seemingly manneristic extent lenghtwise of limbs. Both features are evident in the Mercury. The Austrian sculptor Georg Rafael Donner greatly admired Duquesnoy's Mercury and his Apollo and Cupid. Duquesnoy's authorship was forgotten in the eighteenth century, and the work was thought to be an antique. The Mercury was among the ancient sculptures which Donner admired and copied, although in fact the bronze wasn't ancient at all.

The king's efforts to impose changes on the church in the 1630s caused widespread protests across Scotland, leading to the organisation of committees to coordinate opposition to the king. Facing royal opposition to the movement, its leaders arranged the creation of the National Covenant, which was designed to bolster the movement by tapping into patriotic fervour and became widely adopted throughout most of Scotland. The Covenant opposed changes to the Church of Scotland, and committed its signatories to stand together in the defence of the nation's religion. Charles saw this as an act of rebellion against his rule, leading to the Bishops' Wars, the result of which required him to call an English Parliament. This parliament passed acts limiting the king's authority, and these disputes ultimately led to the First English Civil War.  Background  Riots over the Prayer Book, set off by Jenny Geddes The 16th century Reformation resulted in a Church of Scotland which was Presbyterian in structure and Calvinist in doctrine. In 1560, the Scottish Parliament designated the kirk as the sole form of religion in Scotland, and adopted the Scots Confession which rejected many Catholic teachings and practices, including bishops. The origins of the National Covenant arose from different perspectives on who held ultimate authority over the kirk; James VI argued the king was also head of the church, governing through bishops appointed by himself. The alternative view held the kirk was subject only to God, and its members, including James, were subject to the discipline of presbyteries, consisting of ministers and elders. James successfully imposed bishops on the kirk in 1596, but it remained Calvinist in doctrine; when he also became king of England in 1603, a unified Church of England and Scotland was the first step in building a centralised, Unionist state. The problem was that while both were nominally Episcopalian in structure, and Protestant in doctrine, the Church of England was very different from the kirk in its forms of worship, and even Scottish bishops objected to many of these. The outbreak of the Thirty Years' War in 1618 and the Counter Reformation led to a general perception that Protestant Europe was under attack, and increased sensitivity to changes in church practice. This was especially strong in Scotland, which had close economic and cultural links with the Dutch Republic, then fighting for independence from Catholic Spain. In addition, many Scots ministers were commonly educated in French Calvinist universities, which were suppressed in the Huguenot rebellions of the 1620s. After James died in 1624, attempts to create one church were continued by his son Charles I, who was raised in England and lacked familiarity with Scottish institutions. First imposed on the Church of England, many of his reforms were rejected by English Puritans who wanted a church similar to the kirk, creating opposition in both countries. In 1636, the Scottish Book of Discipline was replaced by a new Book of Canons, while anyone who denied the king's supremacy in church matters was subject to excommunication. When followed in 1637 by a new Book of Common Prayer, it resulted in a riot, supposedly started when a market-trader named Jenny Geddes threw a stool at the dean of St Giles' Cathedral. Protests quickly spread across Scotland, with hundreds of opponents gathering in Edinburgh.  Organisation  Following the Prayer Book riots protestors became more organized, and in November 1637 began claiming councillors had encouraged them to elect commissioners to represent their case to the government. This action was endorsed by Sir Thomas Hope, the king's advocate, and the protestors created a nationwide network of committees known as 'Tables', with committee in each shire sending representatives to four Tables in Edinburgh, one each for nobles, shire commissioners, burgh commissioners and ministers. A fifth Table was elected by these four which coordinated the movement as a whole. In February 1638, Charles declared he was personally responsible for introducing the Prayer Book, rather than his bishops or councillors, and that anyone opposing it was a traitor. His opponents now recognized they were challenging Charles directly and for reasons of self- preservation introduced the Covenant in an attempt to unite the nation behind them. The document itself was drafted by Archibald Johnston, an Edinburgh lawyer, and Alexander Henderson, the minister of Leuchars in Fife.  Content  The National Covenant starts by repeating the Negative or King's Confession, signed in 1581 as an anti-Catholic statement by James VI. This is followed by a list of parliamentary statutes defining the polity and liturgy of the church in Scotland. The Covenant concludes with a bond committing the signatories to stand together to maintain the nation's religion and oppose any changes to it. Signatories were also committed to upholding the king's authority, although it was understood this did not include obedience to an ill-advised king. The Covenant had the appearance of working within constitutional precedent, contributing to its success in appealing to all areas of Scottish society by drawing on a sense of patriotic outrage at the rule and policies of Charles as an absentee monarch, as well as the provincialization of Scotland within a system dominated by England. The Covenant was also vague enough to avoid putting people off, for example by implicitly supporting Presbyterianism, without explicitly condemning episcopacy. The precise details were less important than the sense that political and religious authority started with the community, rather than with the king.  Adoption  William Hole The National Covenant was formally adopted on 28 February 1638 by a meeting at Greyfriars Kirk in Edinburgh, and copies were then distributed across Scotland. Many of those who were reluctant to sign were intimidated into doing so, with clergymen who opposed it being deposed. By the end of May the western highlands, Aberdeenshire and Banff were the only places the Covenant had not been widely accepted, with resistance in these areas being led by George Gordon, the Marquess of Huntly. In November 1638 the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland met in Glasgow, where it approved the Covenant and passed resolutions abolishing bishops and the use of the new Prayer Book. In August 1638 the privy council agreed that all the king's subjects should subscribe to it, although in November the act was removed from the council's register. It 1640 the Covenant was sanctioned by the Scottish Parliament, and this act would be published under the king's name in 1641.  Consequences  Following the signing of the Covenant it was clear to Charles that his Scottish subjects were in rebellion against him. This would be confirmed when they seized strongholds and began to raise forces. The king responded by hastily gathering his forces and marching on Scotland in 1639, starting the First Bishops' War, where his forces proved no match for the Covenanters. This would be followed in 1640 by the Second Bishops‚Äô War, which concluded with the Treaty of Ripon allowing Scottish forces to remain in control of Northumberland and Durham until a final peace treaty was agreed with the English Parliament. Charles would not be able to disband this Parliament, which began to pass acts limiting his power and leading to the arrest of his councillors. In time, these disputes would lead to the First English Civil War, which started in 1642. The success of the Covenanters encouraged opponents of the king in his other realms of England and Ireland, with leaders of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 later admitting to being inspired by their example. In 1643 the Covenanters would sign the Solemn League and Covenant with the English Parliament, turning the tide in the First English Civil War.

The twentieth tropical depression, nineteenth named storm, eighth hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, Teddy initially formed from a tropical depression that developed from a tropical wave on September 12\\\\. Initially, the depression's large size and moderate wind shear kept it from organizing, but it eventually intensified into Tropical Storm Teddy on September 14\\\\. After steadily intensifying for about a day, the storm rapidly became a Category 2 hurricane on September 16 before moderate wind shear caused the storm to fluctuate in intensity. It then rapidly intensified again on September 17 and became a Category 4 hurricane. Internal fluctuations and eyewall replacement cycles then caused the storm to fluctuate in intensity before it weakened some as it approached Bermuda. After passing east of the island of Category 1 hurricane on September 21, Teddy restrengthened back to Category 2 strength due to baroclinic forcing. It weakened back down to Category 1 hurricane the next day before becoming a post-tropical as it approached Atlantic Canada early on September 23\\\\. It then weakened to a gale-force low and made landfall in Nova Scotia with winds of 65 mph. It executed a large loop as it accelerated first northward then eastward north of Newfoundland, briefly strengthening back to a storm-force low before weakening again and losing its identity on September 27\\\\. Tropical storm watches and warnings were issued for both Bermuda and Atlantic Canada in prepartion for Teddy. Its large size and strength caused high waves and rip currents to impact areas hundreds of miles from its path, ranging from the Lesser and Greater Antilles to the East Coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada. Two people in Puerto Rico drowned from the strong waves while another person drowned in New Jersey. Teddy's total damage was estimated to be in the millions. Meteorological history The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began to monitor a tropical wave over West Africa at 00:00 UTC on September 7. Development of this wave was expected and at 00:00 UTC on September 9, it was given a high chance to develop within five days despite still being well inland. The wave entered the Atlantic Ocean at 12:00 UTC on September 10, and began to steadily organize, forming a broad low-pressure area at 18:00 UTC on September 11, although its large size kept it from organizing quickly. The next day, the low finally became more defined and at 21:00 UTC on September 12, the NHC designated the disturbance as Tropical Depression Twenty. At first, the depression struggled to organize for over a day due to its large size and moderate wind shear. After the shear decreased, the system became better organized and strengthened into Tropical Storm Teddy at 09:00 UTC on September 14, becoming the earliest 19th tropical or subtropical storm on record in an Atlantic hurricane season, surpassing the old mark of October 4, which was previously set by the unnamed \\"Azores\\" subtropical storm in 2005. It continued to intensify as it became better organized, with an eye beginning to form late on September 15. It then rapidly intensified into a hurricane around 06:00 UTC the next day. The storm continued to intensify, becoming a Category 2 hurricane later that day. However, some slight westerly wind shear briefly halted intensification and even weakened the storm to a Category 1 at 03:00 UTC on September 17. However, as the shear relaxed again, the storm began a second rapid intensification phase, becoming the season's second major hurricane at 15:00 UTC that day. Teddy continued to intensify at a rapid pace and became a Category 4 hurricane six hours later, reaching its peak intensity of 140 mph (220 km/h) and a pressure of 945 mb (27.91 inHg). Afterwards, internal fluctuation and an eyewall replacement cycle caused the storm to weaken slightly to a Category 3 hurricane at 09:00 UTC on September 18. Soon after, Teddy briefly restrengthened into a Category 4 hurricane before another eyewall replacement cycle weakened it again. Continued internal fluctuations caused the eye to nearly dissipate and Teddy weakened below major hurricane status at 12:00 UTC on September 20. Teddy continued moving north, weakening to a Category 1 hurricane as it began to merge with a trough late on September 21\\\\. At 15:00 UTC that day, the storm made its closest approach to Bermuda as a strong Category 1 hurricane before accelerating northwestwards away from the island. A Hurricane hunters flight found that Teddy had strengthened a bit, due to a combination of baroclinic energy infusion from the trough and warm oceanic waters from the Gulf Stream and it was upgraded back to Category 2 status. Teddy also doubled in size as a result of merging with the trough. The hurricane kept expanding and started an extratropical transition while it neared the Atlantic Canada coast. Although Teddy appeared to be a post- tropical cyclone, Hurricane hunters found a warm core in Teddy's center. Just before transitioning into an post-tropical cyclone, the diameter of gale-force winds measured up to 850 mi (1,370 km) across from northeast to southwest, making Teddy the 4th largest Atlantic hurricane on record. By then, Teddy had weakened back down to a Category 1 hurricane before transitioning to a post- tropical cyclone at 00:00 UTC on September 23. At 12:00 UTC, the storm made landfall near Ecum Secum, Nova Scotia with winds of 65 mph (105 km/h) with a minimum central pressure of 964 mb (28.47 inHg). It continued to weaken and the NHC issued their final advisory at 03:00 UTC on September 24. Post- Tropical Cyclone Teddy then accelerated northward before making a large loop north of Newfoundland and turning east, briefly strengthening back to a storm- force low before weakening again and losing its identity on September 27. Preparations, impact, and records A wave height of 42 feet was recorded during Hurricane Teddy by buoy 44150 near Nova Scotia. Large swells were generated by the storm, which affected the Lesser Antilles, the East Coast of the United States, Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada. One buoy operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in the open northern Atlantic off the coast of Nova Scotia reported a wave height of early on September 22. Another wave height of was reported later in the day by the same buoy. Waves reached at another buoy just north of Teddy on the afternoon of September 22, with winds gusting near . =Bermuda= Tropical storm watches, which were later upgraded to warnings, were issued for Bermuda due to the impacts expected from Teddy. The Government of Bermuda shut down the island on September 21, closing all government services such as public transportation and schools. The L.F. Wade International Airport was closed during the storm, but reopened on September 22 after the storm passed. 220 homes lost power on the island, mainly in Hamilton and Pembroke parishes. Beach erosion was also reported. =United States= Storm surge from Teddy affecting North Carolina on September 20, with North Carolina Highway 12 being entirely flooded in this picture. The National Weather Service warned of high winds and coastal flooding in eastern New England. A high wind warning was issued for Nantucket and coastal Plymouth County on September 22. In addition, a high surf advisory was issued for those areas and for Bristol County. A wind advisory was issued for other coastal communities on mainland Massachusetts. For all of Massachusetts, a Red Flag warning was issued, signalling that critical fire weather conditions were possible due dry weather and gusty winds. In North Carolina, a coastal flood warning was in effect for the Northern Outer Banks and Hatteras Island until September 21, but minor coastal flooding was forecasted by the National Weather Service until September 22. A coastal flood advisory was extended to for Pamlico, Southern Craven, Carteret and coastal Oslow counties as well as Ocracoke Island and Core Banks until the afternoon of September 22. The same advisory for Beaufort County and Tyrrell Counties expired early on September 22. A high surf advisory was issued and extended for beaches north of Cape Lookout until September 23. On September 18, a man and a woman drowned in the waters off La Pocita Beach in Lo√≠za, Puerto Rico due to the rip currents and churning waves that Teddy had caused in the north of the Lesser and Greater Antilles. Charleston, South Carolina, experienced high tides topping out at major flood stage for three straight days from September 19 to 21. This was the first time such an event had been documented for three days in a row in records dating to at least 1934. The city reported some flooding in its historical downtown district, along with some other areas near the coast. In North Carolina, coastal communities experienced beach erosion and coastal flooding. North Carolina Highway 12 was closed from September 20 to September 22 due to persistent storm surge and sand being carried onto the road. In addition, more than 80 dunes were washed away at Cape Hatteras National Seashore. Rip currents along the eastern seaboard also led to a drowning near Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey. No rain was reported in Massachusetts, however wind gusts over were reported near Cape Cod. In Maine, very large waves pounded the coast, drawing onlookers and surfers. A fence was taken out by storm surge in Scarborough. Emergency officials were on standby across southern Maine in case flooding became a hazard. In Camp Ellis, the storm threatened to erode the shoreline. Some people in the town decided to put up storm shutters during the storm in case houses were flooded. =Canada= Hurricane Teddy approaching Nova Scotia on September 22, shortly before becoming extratropical Tropical Storm Watches were issued as the storm approached the region, these were later upgraded to warnings. Municipal sports fields, all-weather fields, tracks and baseball diamonds were closed on September 23 and all bookings were cancelled. School was also cancelled for many regions around the province. Halifax Transit stopped services during most of the storm, but resumed its services at 12:00 ADT (15:00 UTC) on September 23. Ferry service began immediately, while buses became fully operational an hour later. The Halifax Public Gardens reopened at the same time as Halifax Transit, but residents and tourists were asked to avoid visiting municipal parks until the storm passed due to safety concerns. Teddy spread moderate to heavy rainfall in Nova Scotia, peaking at in Ingonish. In addition, a peak wind gust of was reported in Grand √âtang.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova- scotia/teddy-storm-nova-scotia-1.5735080 In Bedford, the Sackville River overtopped its banks, flooding a nearby park. around 20,000 customers lost power across the province, but impacts in Nova Scotia were lesser than originally predicted.

He went to Southbridge Academy and Williston Seminary, and then attended Yale University, graduating in 1862. During the Civil War, he fought for the Union for nine months as a sergeant in the 45th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment. He later graduated from the Andover Theological Seminary, and held pastorates in Monson, Massachusetts (at Monson Academy), West Somerville, Massachusetts, Tucson, Arizona, Pomona, California, and Claremont, California. In 1888, he left the Pilgrim Congregational Church in Pomona to become Pomona College's \\"financial agent with supervisory authority\\", a position in which he assumed the duties of a college president. During his tenure, the college began teaching its first classes in Ayer Cottage and acquired of land in Piedmont Mesa north of Pomona for a planned permanent campus. In October 1888, the college acquired an unfinished hotel in Claremont (today's Sumner Hall) and moved there in the following months. In 1890, he helped recruit Pomona's first official president, Cyrus G. Baldwin. Sumner remained a Pomona College trustee until his retirement in 1924. He also taught biblical literature at the college between 1888 and 1899. In 1892, he opposed the college's decision to make Claremont its permanent home, but he later relocated his house to Claremont in 1901, living in it during the six-week move. In 1910, Pomona gave him the college's first honorary doctorate, a Legum Doctor degree. In 1914, he published a comprehensive history of the college. Sumner was also involved in the development of citrus fruit marketing cooperatives, and served as the president of the Indian Hill Citrus Association and San Dimas Orange Association, and the director of the San Dimas Lemon Association. He died on July 11, 1927, of pneumonia. Legacy Sumner's daughter, Helen, and son, George, both graduated from Pomona's first class of students in 1894. George later taught economics at Pomona and became its controller in 1923. His grandson, George Charles Sumner Benson, became the founding president of Claremont McKenna College. Sumner's house was occupied by his son and grandson, and later rented to faculty and used as a dormitory for vegetarian students. It has served as the college's guest house since 1992. Pomona's first building, Sumner Hall, was named for his wife, Mary Louisa Stedman Sumner, in 1893. It serves as the college's office of admissions today.

Geology The Soda Dam was formed by calcium carbonate and travertine deposits from thermal spring water that was built up over the course of 7,000 years. The river flows through the dome-like bridge created by the deposition of these minerals across the river. There is also a waterfall at the site. It is over 300 feet long, 50 feet high, and 50 feet wide at the base. The hot spring water is heated by volcanic magma of the Valles Caldera. The water percolates through shale and limestone, following cracks in the Jemez geological fault zone to emerge at the springs. Because algal filaments are contained within the carbonate rock, the site is used to study ways in which possible ancient life on Mars may be detected through examination of rocks. History The springs were used by local indigenous people before the arrival of settlers. Artifacts and archaeological finds have been discovered at Jemez Cave near Soda Dam; evidence of human use as long ago as 2,500 B.C. In the 1960s, New Mexico state highway #4 was built which involved blasting the rock to build the road. The course of the spring water changed at that time, and now most of it flows into ditches on either side of the road. Some of the springs stopped flowing entirely.

It is believed to have been founded by the Byzantines in the 6th century AD and it was destroyed and rebuilt several times over subsequent centuries. The last reconstruction began in 1505 to designs of the architect Cristoforo da Legname, and it was completed by Jacopo Sansovino in 1557. This church was a significant example of Venetian Renaissance architecture, and it was well-known for being ornate and richly decorated. The building was demolished in 1807 in order to make way for the Napoleonic wing of the Procuratie, and many of the artworks it contained were distributed among other churches and museums.  History  According to tradition, the first church of Saint Geminianus in Venice was established in around 554 to 564 AD by the Byzantine general Narses. It is said to have been built in order to thank the Venetians for their assistance during a siege of Ravenna. It is unclear if this building was destroyed by fire in 976, and the church is first documented with certainty in 1023. It might have been destroyed during a series of fires and earthquakes in 1106. In the late 12th century, during the tenure of Doge Sebastiano Ziani, the church was demolished and rebuilt in another location in order to make way for the expansion of Piazza San Marco. Venice: Piazza San Marco looking west towards San Geminiano ( 1723‚Äì24), painting by Canaletto in the Royal Collection The 12th century church was demolished and replaced once again in the early 16th century. Construction began in 1505 to designs of the architect Cristoforo da Legname, but by the middle of the century the building remained incomplete. In 1552 the church's procurator Tommaso Rangone commissioned the architect Jacopo Sansovino to design a fa√ßade for the building, which was to include a statue of himself. The Senate denied this proposal, but a statue of Rangone was later featured on the fa√ßade of the nearby church of San Zulian. After Sansovino finalised the church's design, works resumed and the building was completed in 1557. Sansovino was buried within the church after his death in 1570, and his children Fiorenza and Francesco were later also buried with him. Plan of San Geminiano (right) and a plan and elevation of the Napoleonic wing of the Procuratie which replaced it (centre and left) After the fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797, the church was used as barracks because of its strategic position at the centre of the city. It was later torn down in order to make way for the Napoleonic wing of the Procuratie, with demolition commencing on 19 May 1807. At this point, the church's artworks were dispersed among other churches and museums, Jacopo Sansovino's remains were reburied at the Seminario della Salute, and the relics of St Geminianus which had been held in the church were transferred to . The church's demolition had been opposed by many artists including Leopoldo Cicognara. In his 1842 Hand-book for Travellers in Northern Italy, Sir Francis Palgrave lamented the demolition of San Geminiano as \\"Gallic vandalism, which has inflicted such irreparable injury upon the fine arts.\\" Today, the site where the church formerly stood is marked by an inscription together with an elevation of its fa√ßade.  Architecture  San Geminiano was a small but richly decorated church which was planned around a central dome. The fa√ßade had elegant proportions and it was decorated with marble and stone from Istria. Internally, the building had a nave which ended in a chapel containing the high altar, along with aisles on either side which ended in smaller chapels. The interior was lavishly decorated. The author Leonico Goldini described the building as \\"almost like a ruby among pearls\\" when compared to other churches in Venice, while Francesco Sansovino, whose father had designed the church, described it as \\"extremely rich and well-conceived in design.\\"  Artworks  Saint Mary Magdalene and Saint Barbara (1490) by Bartolomeo Vivarini, formerly part of an altarpiece at San Geminiano The church contained several significant works of Renaissance art, and after its demolition many of its artworks have been distributed to museums or other churches. The church contained a 1490 altarpiece by Bartolomeo Vivarini, and two panels from it (Saint Mary Magdalene and Saint Barbara) have been in the Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia since 1812. The doors of the church's organ had large panel paintings of Saints Geminianus and Severus and smaller paintings of John the Baptist and Menna. These were the work of Paolo Veronese, and they had been commissioned by Benedetto Manzini. They are now located in the Galleria Estense in Modena. One of the church's altars included the painting Saint Helena with Saints Geminianus and Menna ( 1510) by Bernardino da Murano, which is now in the Accademia. Angel Foretelling Saint Catharine of Her Martyrdom ( 1560‚Äì70) by Tintoretto The Scuola di Santa Caterina had an altar within the church, and it had an altarpiece which depicted Saint Catherine of Alexandria by Giovanni Bellini. This was replaced by the painting Angel Foretelling Saint Catharine of Her Martyrdom by Tintoretto in around 1560‚Äì70, and the Bellini painting has since been lost. When the church was demolished, Tintoretto's work was acquired by the Galleria dell'Accademia in Florence until it was sold in 1818. It was subsequently in the hands of various private collectors, including David Bowie who purchased it in 1987. Since 2019, the painting has been exhibited at the Doge's Palace on a long-term loan. The church's marble high altar was designed by Cristoforo da Legname and it included statues of saints sculpted by within niches. The has been relocated to Venice's church of San Giovanni di Malta. Busts of the priests Matteo e' Eletto and Benedetto Manzini which were sculpted by Bergamasco and Alessandro Vittoria respectively originally flanked this altar, and they are now located in the Galleria Giorgio Franchetti alla Ca' d'Oro. Another bust by Vittoria which depicted Tommaso Rangone was located on a vestibule and it is now found in the Ateneo Veneto. The church also contained works by Gerolamo Santacroce, Giuseppe Scolari, Ludovico Spinelli, Alvise dal Friso, Gerolamo Brusaferro, Sebastiano Ricci and Gregorio Lazzarini.

The Lacquered Stella, Stella Day-Date, or Stella, as it is more commonly called, is a variant of the Rolex Day-Date self-winding chronometer, which features vivid, bright-color dials. Rolex introduced the Stella dial watches in the 1970s to Middle Eastern and Asian markets and was rumored to be named after the American painter Frank Stella. Like the Rolex Day-Date, the Stella dial features the date and the day, spelled in full, but unlike the standard edition Day-Date which traditionally features dial colors in black, gold, or silver, the Stella features dial colors in red, orange, oxblood, blue, green, turquoise, peach, salmon, pink, yellow, or purple.  History  Originally introduced in the 1970s, the Stella dial was considered unpopular due to the vibrancy of colors, as Rolex buyers preferred the more conservative Day-Date dials, like white, black, and silver. Due to a limited production and the possibility Rolex destroyed several Stella pieces due to lack of commercial success, the Stella has become popular among vintage watch collectors and is considered to be an inspiration to newer Rolex models with vividly colored dials. The Stella model with 18k gold and yellow lacquered dial is considered one of the rarest, with one selling at Christie's for $131,250 USD in 2019, with another selling for 275,000 Swiss Francs (approximately $300,000 USD) at Phillips. Other models with different dial color and band combinations have been sold for over CHF50,000. In 2013, Rolex released a new Day-Date with vividly colored leather straps and matching colored dials that Rolex enthusiasts also dubbed \\"Stella.\\" In September 2020, Rolex introduced five new Oyster Perpetual watches featuring bright, vibrant colored, enamel lacquered dials like the original Stella from the 1970s.https://content.rolex.com/dam/new-watches-2020/media/brochures/grand- public/2020_Oyster_New_Models_en.pdf  References  Category:Rolex watches ","title":"Rolex Stella"},{"id":"65345809","text":"Felix Beiersdorf (born 1 August 1998) is a German footballer who plays as a midfielder for Leipziger SV S√ºdwest.

Completed and commissioned in July 1944, she served in World War II and conducted transport missions between Japan and outlying islands until she was converted into a kaiten suicide attack torpedo carrier. She survived the war, but sank after striking a mine in the weeks immediately following its conclusion. Construction and commissioning I-363 was laid down on 1 May 1943 by Kure Navy Yard at Kure, Japan, with the name Submarine No. 5463. She was renamed I-363 on 20 October 1943 and provisionally attached to the Yokosuka Naval District that day. She was launched on 12 December 1943 and was completed and commissioned on 8 July 1944. Service history Upon commissioning, I-363 was attached formally to the Yokosuka Naval District and was assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 for workups. She departed Hikari on 8 August 1944. With her workups complete, she was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 7 on 15 September 1944. =Transport missions= On 9 October 1944, I-363 departed Yokosuka bound for Mereyon Island at Woleai in the Caroline Islands on her first transport mission, carrying 75 metric tons of food and supplies and 15 metric tons of other cargo. En route, he stopped at Truk from 21 to 24 October 1944, where she picked up another 10 metric tons of cargo for Mereyon consisting of food and uniforms. She arrived at Mereyon on 28 October 1944, unloaded five tons of fuel and supplies, embarked seven passengers, and got back underway the same day. She returned to Truk on 31 October 1944, unloaded 33 metric tons of fuel oil, embarked 83 Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service personnel, and put back to sea on 2 November 1944 bound for Yokosuka, which she reached on 15 November 1944. She got underway from Yokosuka on 30 November 1944 for a training exercise, but returned the same day after her commanding officer suffered an injury. I-363 departed Yokosuka on 10 November 1944 for her second transport voyage carrying a cargo of 88 metric tons of food, 10 metric tons of ammunition, and 10 metric tons of other supplies, this time setting course for Marcus Island, which she reached on 17 November 1944. After unloading her cargo and embarking 60 passengers, she left the same day bound for Yokosuka, where she arrived on 26 December 1944. She then began an overhaul. With the overhaul complete, I-363 put to sea from Yokosuka on 5 March 1945 for her third supply voyage, again bound for Marcus Island. She arrived at Marcus on 13 March 1945, unloaded her cargo, and headed back to Yokosuka. During her voyage, Submarine Squadron 7 was deactivated on 20 March 1945 and she was reassigned to Submarine Division 15. She reached Yokosuka on 30 March 1945. =Kaiten carrier= While I-363 was on her return voyage from Marcus Island, U.S. forces captured advanced bases and anchorages in the Kerama Islands southwest of Okinawa between 26 and 29 March 1945, and shortly after her arrival at Yokosuka, the Battle of Okinawa began when U.S. forces landed on Okinawa itself on 1 April 1945. After reaching Yokosuka, I-363 was converted from a transport submarine into a kaiten suicide attack torpedo carrier, the conversion involving the removal of her deck gun and Daihatsu- class landing craft and their replacement with fittings allowing her to carry five kaitens on her deck, First kaiten mission By 28 May 1945, I-363 was part of the Todoroki (\\"Thunderclap\\") Kaiten Group along with the submarines , , and . With five kaitens on board, she got underway from the kaiten base at Hikari that day bound for a patrol area between Okinawa and Ulithi Atoll. On 15 June 1945, I-363 sighted a convoy southeast of Okinawa. With the seas too rough for her to launch her kaitens, she attacked with conventional torpedoes instead. Her commanding officer believed she sank one merchant ship, although in fact she inflicted no damage. On 18 June, she received orders to end her patrol and proceed to Hirao, Japan, which she reached on 28 June 1945. She moved on to Kure on 29 June 1945. Second kaiten mission Assigned to the Tamon Kaiten Group along with the submarines , , , , and , I-363 departed Hikari on 8 August 1945, the last of the group‚Ä≤s submarines to get underway. She was assigned a patrol area north of Palau, but on 12 August 1945 received orders to instead patrol in the Sea of Japan to defend the Japanese archipelago against a possible Soviet invasion. She was on the surface northwest of Kyushu on 14 August 1945 when aircraft of United States Navy Task Force 38 strafed her, killing two members of her crew but inflicting only minor damage on her. =End of war= On 15 August 1945, while I-363 was at sea, World War II ended with Emperor Hirohito‚Ä≤s Jewel Voice Broadcast announcing the cessation of hostilities between Japan and the Allies. I-363 arrived at Kure on 18 August 1945 and surrendered to the Allies on 2 September 1945, the same day that Japan formally surrendered in a ceremony aboard the battleship in Tokyo Bay. =Loss= On 27 October 1945, I-363 got underway from Kure bound for Sasebo. She was off the coast of Miyazaki Prefecture on 29 October 1945 when she struck a mine that had been laid during World War II. She sank with the loss of 36 lives. There were 10 survivors. She was stricken from the Navy list on 10 November 1945. Final disposition The Fukada Salvage Company refloated I-363‚Ä≤s wreck on 26 January 1966. The wreck was scrapped at Etajima.

In 1890, Randall opened his own office in New York, and during his brief career specialized in residential work, noted examples of which were a number of large country estates. The following year in 1891, Randall went into partnership with Percy Griffin (1866-1921), who had also graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and worked in the office of H. H. Richardson. In the early 1890s, Griffin & Randall, with Randall as designer, was chosen to design the Baltimore Music Hall. Selection of an architect was made by competition, with the entries judged by Richard Morris Hunt and Griffin & Randall beating out Carr√®re and Hastings. Randall designed the Hall along the same lines as the Neues Gewandhaus of Leipzig, but his plans for an imposing Baroque circular front never materialized due to a lack of funds. The Hall was built between 1893 and 1894 and opened on October 31, 1894, with a gala concert by the Boston Symphony, directed by Emil Faur. Griffin & Randall was also chosed by James W. Allison, a successful fertilizer producer, to design his house in Richmond, Virginia. Randall chose the Colonial Revival design, one of the first of that style built in Richmond. In 1895, Griffin and Randall decided to part ways in the middle of the construction of the Allison house. Allison choose Randall to oversee the completion of his house as he was the senior partner and had the most influence over the building's design. Later, Griffin designed the Hotel Caribbee in Montego Bay, Jamaica, in 1896. In the late 1890s he was awarded the commissions for the Jefferson Davis Monument in Richmond and the Colored Orphan Asylum on West 114th Street. In 1899, construction was completed on the Neoclassical Woodward Hall (named for Henry Williams Woodward, father of banker James T. Woodward) which was designed for the Annapolis campus of St. John's College. The brick building initially housed the college library, biological laboratory, chemical and physical laboratories, and the armory. In 1997, Woodward Hall was rededicated as the Barr-Buchanan Center, housing the Graduate Institute and King William Room. In 1903, construction was completed on Randall's second of two buildings for St. John's. The brick Beaux-Arts building was constructed to house the college dining hall, kitchen, and dormitory rooms. It was originally known as Mess Hall and Senior Hall, but was officially renamed Randall Hall in honor of his brother, John Wirt Randall, in 1912. Henry Yates Satterlee, the first Bishop of Washington, commissioned Randall to design the temporary baptistry of Washington National Cathedral, today known as The Herb Cottage. Construction began in 1903 and was completed in the spring of 1904, several years before the Cathedral itself began in 1907. Randall was a member of the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects and the Architectural League of New York. =Major projects= * First National Bank Building in Baltimore, Maryland * Epiphany Church (alterations) in Washington, D.C. * Ingleside, the Bernard N.

It is scheduled to be released on 30 October 2020 through Capitol Records. The album was originally titled To Die For and was due for release in June 2020 but was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Smith also felt it was insensitive to use the word \\"die\\" due to what many people were going through. Background In an interview with Zach Sang in October 2019, Smith confirmed that their third album would be released in 2020, and said it will feature \\"fewer ballads and plenty of poppier tracks\\" than their previous albums, which they called an \\"acoustic-y, soulful version of pop music\\". Smith went on to explain that the reception to their recent songs had \\"almost given me permission to kinda do what I've always dreamed of doing but I was always scared to do, which is pop music.\\" Smith opened a pop-up store in Soho, London named after the album in February 2020 before the release of the single \\"To Die For\\". Release and title Originally titled To Die For, Smith's third album was due to be released on 1 May 2020, but was then pushed back to 5 June 2020. By the end of March, Smith had confirmed that they had decided to delay the album till later in the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On their social media account, they posted the following message: \\"I have done a lot of thinking the last few weeks and feel that the title of my album and imminent release doesn't feel right ... I have to come to the decision to continue working on the album and make some important changes and additions. I will be renaming the album and pushing back the release date‚Äîboth of which are to be confirmed at this time\\". On Friday 17 April, Smith explained the reasons for changing the album during an interview with Zoe Ball on BBC Radio 2, stating that the \\"album had the word 'die' in the title, which I just felt really uncomfortable with, with what's happening [coronavirus] and it's so important for me to be sensitive to my fans and to people listening to my music. This has been a really sad and awful time for us, so I've changed the album title, I'm going to change the album cover.\\" The original cover art depicted Smith facing head-on with hands all around them. The hands on the album cover belong to Smith's \\"chosen family\\", Shea Diamond, Alok Menon, Jeff Hova, and Madison Phillips. Upon postponing the album, Smith announced that a new cover art would be produced. Singles Before its pushback, Smith had released a number of singles in promotion of the album. \\"Promises\\" with Calvin Harris, \\"Fire on Fire\\" from the miniseries Watership Down, \\"Dancing with a Stranger\\" with Normani, \\"How Do You Sleep?\\", \\"I Feel Love\\" (Smith's cover of Donna Summer's 1977 single), \\"To Die For\\", and \\"I'm Ready\\" with Demi Lovato were all included on the album's original preorder, but are now all included as bonus tracks on the album, with the exception of \\"I Feel Love\\". \\"My Oasis\\" featuring Burna Boy was released as the lead single from the album on 30 July 2020, followed by the second single \\"Diamonds\\" on 18 September 2020.

It was one of the series of paintings that he made when he was a British official war artist in World War I. The painting has the dimensions of 63.5 cm by 76.2 cm. It belongs to the collection of the Tate in London.Zonnebecke, Tate Description The painting follows the same pattern of brutal realism of those he had created the previous year, while in France, when he witnessed the Battle of the Somme. In 1918, he was doing more allegorical paintings on the subject of the war, but he still made some realistic works.Zonnebecke, Tate This painting takes his name from the municipality of Zonnebeke, in Flanders, Belgium, which had been completely destroyed as part of the Passchendaele campaign, from June to November 1917. The offensive took a massive toil of British and German lives, while the Allies had just advanced five miles at the end of the campaign. The painting depicts the desolate landscape of a battlefield, with grey skies, the remains of the trenches filled with water, and a corpse lying at the right, while a heavily damaged tree is at the left.Zonnebecke, TateSir William Orpen - The Official Artist of the First World War, Daily Art Magazine, 7 February 2017 Orpen wrote on his memoirs of the war, An Onlooker in France 1917-1919 (1921), that a British officer described the scenery of the battle in these words: \\"‚ÄòI remember an officer saying to me, Paint the Somme? I could do it from memory ‚Äì just a flat horizon line and mud-holes and water, and the stumps of a few battered trees.‚Äô but one could not paint the smell.\\".William Orpen, An Onlooker in France 1917-1919 (1921) Orpen also described what he had seen vividly, as reflected in this work: ‚ÄúA hand lying on the duckboards, a Bosche and a Highlander locked in a deadly embrace at the edge of Highwood; the ‚ÄòCough-Drop‚Äô with the stench coming from its watery bottom; the shell-holes with the shapes of bodies faintly showing through the putrid water ‚Äì all these things made one think terribly of what human beings had been through.‚ÄùWilliam Orpen, An Onlooker in France 1917-1919 (1921) References Category:1918 in art Category:1918 paintings Category:Paintings by William Orpen Category:War paintings ","title":"Zonnebeke (painting)"},{"id":"65346459","text":"Professor and the Madman is a four-piece rock band featuring co- frontmen/songwriters Alfie Agnew and Sean Elliott, drummer Rat Scabies and bassist Paul Gray. Agnew had been in the punk bands Adolescents and D.I. and Elliott had played guitar in D.I. Scabies and Gray were the rhythm section of The Damned, and they appeared together on a pair of The Damned's studio albums: The Black Album (1980) and Strawberries (1982). Gray also played in Eddie and the Hot Rods and UFO. After playing in punk bands as an adolescent, Agnew left the scene for college at 18, and got out of music in the early '90s while going to graduate school. He is currently a math professor at CSU Fullerton. In 2015, his ex-bandmate, Sean Elliott, got in touch with him about playing music together again in a cover band called The Critens. Having reunited, they began collaborating on original music as Professor and the Madman. The band's name is a nod to Agnew's professorial career, while also a reference to the novel, The Professor and the Madman: A Tale of Murder, Insanity, and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary by Simon Winchester. In 2015, Elliott contacted Agnew to play a reunion show with The Critens for a private Christmas party in Costa Mesa, California. At this gig, they met Scabies, who sat in with them for an encore of The Damned song \\"Smash It Up\\" ‚Äì both Agnew and Elliott were fans of The Damned's The Black Album. They quickly invited Scabies back to Agnew's home studio to collaborate on an early Professor and the Madman song. Pleased with the results, they invited him to be a permanent addition to the band and Scabies has played on all five Professor and the Madman albums. As a trio, they recorded the first two albums, 2016's Elixir 1: Good Evening, Sir! and Elixir 2: Election. After that, they brought Gray into the project. In December 2016, Elliot reached out to him on Facebook, sent him some music, and Gray joined the band. Co-produced by the band and David M. Allen (The Cure, The Damned, The Sisters of Mercy), the Disintegrate Me album was released February 23, 2018 on the band's own Fullertone Records. Agnew and Elliott wrote the music and lyrics and took turns singing lead. The video for the track \\"Space Walrus\\" premiered on Alternative Press on January 17, 2018. Agnew, Elliott, Gray and Scabies made their live concert debut as Professor and the Madman at London's 100 Club on August 10, 2018. This resulted in the live album, Live at the 100 Club, released by Fullertone Records on January 29, 2019. Due to the fact that Agnew and Elliott reside in Southern California, and Gray and Scabies in the UK, scheduling concerts for the recording quartet has proved challenging. As a result, Agnew and Elliott have occasionally performed in the Los Angeles area with guest musicians Frank Agnew (Adolescents, T.S.O.L., 45 Grave), Mark Tolbert (Doggy Style, Crash Kills Four), and local drummer Nick Scalzo. The band's fifth album, S√©ance, scheduled for release November 13, 2020 on Fullertone Records, is a concept album revolving around a group of friends who hold a s√©ance to say goodbye to their loved ones. The album was recorded remotely with Agnew and Elliott sending sound files from California to Scabies and Gray in the U.K. to record the drums and bass.

The merged school continued to be known as the Ernestinum. Until 1947, when it was closed, it was considered the oldest gymnasium in the German-speaking world. It was re-founded in 1991, shortly after German reunification. History The school's earliest forerunner was a Latin school at the parish church of St Mary, which is mentioned in 1291.Christoph K√∂hler et al. (eds.), Festschrift zum 475-j√§hrigen Schuljubil√§um des Gymnasium Ernestinum Gotha 1524‚Äì1999 (Gotha, 1999), p. 8 Friedrich Myconius, founder On 21 December 1524, the school was founded by Friedrich Myconius, a friend of Martin Luther, in the cloister of the Augustinian monastery of Gotha, which was in the process of being dissolved, and was given the Latin name Gymnasium Gothanum.150 Jahre Gymnasium Ernestinum Jahresheft 2008/09 at ernestinum-gotha.de, accessed 17 September 2020 As a result of the Reformation, in the middle of the 16th century the curriculum was changed significantly, under the direction of (1562‚Äì1568). His focus was grammar, the understanding of Roman authors, and careful written work by the students, and he also introduced declamation.K√∂hler et al. (1999), pp. 10‚Äì12Historia Gymnasii Ernestini 1524‚Äì2014 at ernestinum-gotha.de, accessed 17 September 2020 Around 1600, the school's name was honoured by the addition of \\"illustrious\\" by Duke John Casimir of Saxe-Coburg. Under the rector Andreas Wilke (1592‚Äì1631) the number of schoolmasters and classes increased.K√∂hler et al. (1999), p. 20 In the 17th century, the school was further sponsored by Duke Ernest I of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. He gave asylum to sons of persecuted Lutherans from Hungary, Silesia, Poland, Russia, and Scandinavia, who joined the school. Under the rector Andreas Reyher (1641‚Äì1673), the Gotha school system was reformed on the principles of Wolfgang Ratke, and the school became known internationally. The number of subjects increased, with the introduction of Mathematics, poetry, and history, and for the first time there was teaching in German. Rhetoric, logic, ethics, and metaphysics, were taught in the Selecta, or final year.K√∂hler et al. (1999) By 1723, the school was already known as the Gymnasium Ernestinum.Johann Christian Martini, Kurtze und deutliche Anweisung zur neuen Staats-Geographie (Lochner, 1723): p. 432: ‚ÄúGotha... ein Gymnasium Illustre, welches Ernestinum heisset.‚Äù In the 18th century, the Enlightenment reshaped education in much of northern Europe, and the school received great support from Duke Ernest II of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, guided by the principle that good education in all subjects was essential for the economic and political stability of the Duchy. Under Johann Gottfried Gei√üler as rector (1768‚Äì1779), the time given to ancient languages was reduced in favour of the natural sciences and German, English, and French literature. The school enjoyed notable rectors, including Friedrich Andreas Stroth (1779‚Äì1785), and Friedrich Wilhelm D√∂ring (1786‚Äì1833), and also renowned schoolmasters such as Johann Georg August Galletti, Johann Friedrich Salomon Kaltwasser, Adolf Heinrich Friedrich von Schlichtegroll, Johann Kaspar Friedrich Manso, and Friedrich Jacobs. In 1807, the future philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer was admitted to the schoolDavid Cartwright, Schopenhauer: A Biography (Cambridge University Press, 2010, ), p. 128 and in 1808 was expelled for a prank.Arthur Schopenhauer at brandeis.edu, accessed 23 September 2020 The new building in the Bergallee, pictured about 1840 Between 1837 and 1838, a new school building was built in the classical style in the Bergallee. However, the school was challenged by a new competitor, founded in 1836 by the reigning Duke for the benefit of the bourgeoisie, the Real-gymnasium Ernestinum, which had a chiefly scientific and mathematical curriculum. At the older school, chemistry, physics, and geology began to be taught as separate subjects, and the modern languages French and English overtook Latin in importance. On 12 April 1859, the Illustrious Gymnasium and the Ducal Realgymnasium were merged into a single school, which was named Gymnasium Ernestinum Gothae in honour of Duke Ernest I of Saxe- Coburg-Gotha. The new school was given a new rector, Joachim Marquardt, (1859‚Äì1882), notable for securing discipline without harsh punishments. The school grew, gaining an auditorium, new library rooms, and a gymnasium. Marquardt medallion, 1883 Following Marquardt's death in 1882, the school commissioned a medallion to commemorate him, made by the local engraver Ferdinand Helfricht.S. Krmnicek und M.

Fischer, 1994), pp. 12, 46 A new rector, Otto K√ºttler (1938‚Äì1945), took the school through the Second World War, when it suffered from masters and boys departing on military service. During the war the school library was evacuated to Friedenstein Palace. The school was by then considered the oldest grammar school in the German-speaking world. After the war, the school found itself in the Soviet occupation zone. With the introduction of a new educational system, a humanistic grammar school was no longer required. The last Abitur exams were held in the 1945/46 school year, and in the spring of 1947, the school was closed.Detlef Ignasiak, Das literarische Gotha: von den Anf√§ngen bis zum Ausgang des 20. Jahrhunderts (Quartus-Verlag, 2003), p. 372 (in German) On 10 April 1947, the boys were transferred to a school called the Arnoldischule. The former school buildings were taken over by a new middle school, and then in 1959 by a polytechnic high school, which in 1965 was named POS Albert Schweitzer. Refounding in 1991 On 1 November 1991, following German reunification, the Ernestine Gymnasium was re-established, with Lutz Wagner as Schulleiter, or Principal, and in 1993 the first Abitur examinations took place, after a gap of 48 years. Until 1947, the school had been for boys only, but it was decided to make the newly refounded school coeducational.

History The area covered by the street lay partly within the walls of Roman Eboracum, and entirely within the current Mediaeval York city walls. It emerged as a narrow lane running immediately south-east of the boundary wall of St Leonard's Hospital. It was first recorded in the 1260s as Ffotlesgayle, or \\"Footloose Lane\\", possibly referring to people resident at the hospital who were unable to walk easily. The section north-east of Lendal later became known as \\"Finkle Street\\", a name which has since been reused for a different street in the city centre. By the 18th-century, the entire length of the street was known as Back Lendal. It became increasingly important, as St Leonard's Landing lay at its south-western end, from which the Lendal Ferry ran across the River Ouse. In 1782, the street was widened, the wall of the hospital and part of the building being demolished, but the construction of a new terrace on the north-west side again restricted its width. In 1830, the Yorkshire Museum was opened to the north of the former hospital, and the grounds became the Museum Gardens, with the main access from Back Lendal. In 1846, it was widened with the demolition of the terrace erected in 1782, and around this time, the Museum Chambers concert hall was constructed. By 1852, the road had become known as \\"Museum Street\\". In 1863, the Lendal Ferry was replaced by a new Lendal Bridge, accessed by a gentle ramp from the street, although its old route down to St Leonard's Landing also survives. Layout and architecture Looking east along the street, from Lendal The street runs north-east, starting by the River Ouse at Lendal Bridge, or alternatively at St Leonard's Landing, where it meets Dame Judi Dench Walk. On its north-west side lie firstly Lendal Tower, the neighbouring 18th-century Lendal Hill House, and then a former engine house for the city's waterworks, built in 1836. These adjoin a short section of the York city walls, at the other end of which is a lodge building and the main entrance to the Museum Gardens. Next are the remains of St Leonard's Hospital, then Library Square, onto which the York Library faces, followed by 2-4 Museum Street, two listed buildings. The street ends at its junction with Blake Street, Duncombe Place and St Leonard's Place. Notable buildings on the south-east side of the street include 1 Museum Street, built as the city's register office, now its main tourist information centre, and Thomas' Hotel, built about 1700; and on the other side of Lendal, Club Chambers and River House, two large Victorian buildings near the river.

History  The station owed its existence to rivalry between the first railway companies in Preston. The Bolton and Preston Railway (B&PR;) intended to convert the Lancaster Canal Tramroad for its use, and in 1837 reserved a site at the north end of the tramroad for a station. This site, which was behind the Victoria Hotel in Fishergate and was then occupied by Maxwell House, was near the planned southern end of the Lancaster and Preston Junction Railway (L&PJR;).Greville, M.D. and Holt, G.O. (1960) \\"Railway Development in Preston\\", Railway Magazine, vol. 106, , Feb no. 706, pp. 94-112. When the latter railway was completed, it initially had permission to use the North Union Railway's station (the present-day Preston railway station), but the two companies fell into disagreement and permission was revoked, to take effect from 1 January 1842. The L&PJR; then approached the B&PR; who agreed to complete construction of their station (as a small station with single platform) in time for the L&PJR; to use it from 1 January. The North Union Railway (NUR) responded by allowing L&PJR; trains to use their station, but charged a toll of 6d per passenger (equivalent to ¬£0 in ) through the tunnel under Fishergate that connected their station with the station at Maxwell House. Most passengers avoided the toll by walking the between the two stations. On 1 January 1844, the NUR bought the B&PR;, thus gaining possession of the station at Maxwell House which the L&PJR; was then banned from using. For several weeks L&PJR; passengers alighted on the trackside at nearby Dock Street (off Pitt Street). The NUR and L&PJR; came to agreement on 12 February 1844, and regular passenger trains used the NUR station from then onwards. The station at Maxwell House was used only for occasional excursion trains for several months afterwards. The site was redeveloped into sidings that served the nearby factories.

She died in childbirth, and Jackson cares for her son after she dies. Production Herbert Brodkin was the producer. Robert Mulligan was the director. Horton Foote adapted a William Faulkner short story into the teleplay. Foote's teleplay was remade into the 1972 film, Tomorrow, starring Robert Duvall. The cast included Richard Boone as Jackson Fentry, Kim Stanley as Sarah Eubanks, Chill Wills as Mr. Pruitt, Beulah Bondi as Mrs. Hulie (a midwife), Charles Bickford as Pa Fentry, Arthur Hunnicutt as a circuit-riding preacher, and Elizabeth Patterson as Mrs. Pruitt. Reception In The New York Times, John P. Shanley wrote that the production was written in \\"the plain talk of untutored, uncomplicated persons\\" and was executed with \\"warm, genuine and poignant\\" performances by Stanley and Boone. Dwight Newton of The San Francisco Examiner wrote that the production \\"brilliantly and effectively essayed\\" Faulkner's story. Newton also reacted angrily to a statement by a CBS executive that he saw only \\"a slim possibility\\" that the series would continue much longer. Critic Charlie Wadsworth called it \\"a powerful, expanded adaption\\" of Faulkner's story. He praised the \\"superb\\" supporting cast, including Bondi, Patterson, and Wills, as one of the strongest in Playhouse 90 history.

Impact glue, contact glue or neoprene glue, is a type of glue, used mainly to glue plastic foams, laminates, metal panels, etc. . It also allows the mounting of supports of different types (metal on wood, cork on plaster, wood on cement, etc). Contact-type adhesives do not exclusively designate neoprene adhesives, but also all other adhesives characterized by high instant adhesion.  Special Features  Impact glue has a high adhesive capacity, and it is very resistant, it must be applied in thin layers. Impact adhesives are used in strong bonds with high shear-resistance like laminates, such as bonding Formica to a wooden counter, and in footwear, as in attaching outsoles to uppers. Natural rubber and polychloroprene (Neoprene) are the most commonly used contact adhesives. Both of these elastomers undergo strain crystallization. Contact adhesives must be applied to both surfaces and allowed some time to dry before the two surfaces are pushed together. Some contact adhesives require as long as 24 hours to dry before the surfaces are to be held together. Once the surfaces are pushed together, the bond forms very quickly.Definition of contact adhesive on About.com It is usually not necessary to apply pressure for a long time, so there is less need for clamps.  Inhalation  The neoprene glue is a well kown inhalant, with effects that range from an alcohol-like intoxication and intense euphoria to vivid hallucinations, depending on the substance and the dose. Some inhalant users are injured due to the harmful effects of the solvents or gases or due to other chemicals used in the products that they are inhaling. As with any recreational drug, users can be injured due to dangerous behavior while they are intoxicated, such as driving under the influence. In some cases, users have died from hypoxia (lack of oxygen), pneumonia, cardiac failure or arrest, or aspiration of vomit. Brain damage is typically seen with chronic long-term use of solvents as opposed to short-term exposure. Even though contact adhesives are legal, there have been legal actions taken in some jurisdictions to limit access by minors. While solvent glue is normally a legal product, a Scottish court has ruled that supplying glue to children is illegal if the store knows the children intend to abuse the glue. In the US, thirty-eight of 50 states have enacted laws making various inhalants unavailable to those under the age of 18, or making inhalant use illegal  Presentation  Neoprene adhesives exist in two forms, the so-called \\"liquid\\" form suitable for horizontal surfaces and the thixotropic \\"gel\\" intended for vertical or indoor installation (gel does not flow downwards). It may be packed in a classic glue tube (domestic use), in a pistol cartridge or in a can for large quantities.  Possible confusion about names  The neoprene adhesives discussed here should not be confused with the adhesives under the name \\"neoprene-type glue\\" that have certain characteristics in common with the former but do not have the same composition. The confusion related to the misleading name of these glues, as well as the difference in composition comparing \\"genuine\\" to these \\"imitation glues\\", can be very troublesome when joining certain materials. In fact, \\"neoprene-type glue\\" may be ineffective in places where \\"neoprene glue\\" would not give any gluing problem.  Precautions  Most neoprene glues contain volatile and flammable solvents, it is prudent to use them in a ventilated room and wear a mask that protects the nose and mouth from vapors.  Application  * Wet both surfaces with a spatula (thin, uniform layer of approximately 150 gramms per square meter). * If the support is porous, proceed with a double damping of the surface: the first layer will penetrate the support and the second will be ready to stick. * Drying: allow to dry until the solvents evaporate (15 to 20 min.). * When the adhesive film seems to no longer stick (at the touch of finger), perform the assembly. Attention, the adhession is immediate.  See also  * Adhesive References Bibliography * Ebnesajjad, Sina (2010). \\"History of Adhesives\\".

It lies at the east edge of the national forest. It is about 2 miles north of the entrance of Juniper Creek, and it is along the edge of Big Scrub. There is a short spring run that is about 0.75 miles long and goes to Lake George. The site is managed by Ocala National Forest ‚Äì Lake George Ranger District and run by a private concessioner. It is a popular day use area as well as an archaeological site.  History  Native Americans inhabited the St. Johns River around 5000 years ago, evidenced by radiocarbon dating of shell mounds along the river. Artifacts such as stone age tools, pottery, and other relics have been uncovered at Silver Glen Springs. Silver Glen was previously a large private campground. Later, it gradually transformed into a wilderness setting.  Description  Sixty-five million gallons of water a day come out from two spring vents. At the southwest corner of the spring pool is a small spring vent called ‚ÄúNatural Well‚Äù which contains fish and the occasional manatee. It is not accessible by water to protect the natural habitat, but can be seen from land. Natural Well is 12-15 feet in diameter and 40 feet in depth. The spring vent at the eastern part of the pool is 18 feet deep. The spring pool is large and semicircular, measuring 200 feet north to south and 175 feet east to west. The pool bottom is composed of sand and limestone with some aquatic grass. The water is clear and cool at 72 degrees Fahrenheit. Sometimes large schools of striped bass travel from the lake to the headspring. Also, tilapia can be seen going to the spring and building nests. Mullet can be seen as well. There is an immense cave system under the picnic area adjacent to the spring. The park has the Spring Boils Trail that goes through the woods and leads to a boardwalk that goes to several sand boils, where water bubbles up through the sand. There is an old Native American mound east of the springhead, where Native American groups sometimes have ceremonies. The area around the springs are relatively isolated with some private hunt camps. The Juniper Club is at the eastern entrance to the springs. This all-male club owns three thousand acres of land in the area.  Activities  Silver Glen Springs is a very popular site with large crowds of visitors, especially on the weekends. There is a fee to access the site. Snorkelers can see saltwater and freshwater fish in the same headspring pool. No lifeguards are on duty. Scuba diving and fishing in some areas are prohibited. Canoe rentals are available. There is a picnic area with tables, charcoal grills, and a volleyball net. A small general store provides some goods such as ice and volleyball rentals for the nearby volleyball area. Pets and alcohol are not allowed; in fact, there is a designated cooler checkpoint to screen for alcohol at the entry of the spring area. Restrooms are on site. The park does not permit overnight camping, only day use.  In popular culture  In 1941, the movie company Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer arranged with the Juniper Club to film some scenes of The Yearling at their property. During the filming, a barge sank in Silver Glen and it can still be seen today.

The commission was conceived partly as a response to The New York Times 1619 Project,Trump remarks at a 2020 White House Conference on American History which proponents claim views history from an important new lens and which a group of scholars from Texas State University, Princeton University, City University of New York, and Brown University have argued contains historical inaccuracies. However, Adam Serwer of The Atlantic, argued that the group mainly disagreed with the conclusion that anti-black racism was still a pervasive problem in the United States. As a result of that criticism, The New York Times issued an response defending the project and the connections that it has drawn between the historical and current status of black Americans. However, an update and clarification was later issued, in which the editor wrote that they still stood by the statement that one of the motivations of independence was a concern that the British would disrupt the institution of slavery. But text of the project was modified to make it clear that this was only a motivation for some, not all colonists. Background President Donald Trump had first talked about a \\"patriotic education\\" as early as September 2, 2020. Various federal laws prohibit the federal government from regulating school curricula, which are determined by school districts under rules established by state governments. However, the federal government influences state and local decisions through funding. Trump reiterated his intention to establish the commission in a proclamation on October 6, 2020.

CorCenCC is a freely accessible collection of multiple language samples, gathered from real-life communication, and presented in the searchable online CorCenCC text corpus. The corpus is accompanied by an online teaching and learning toolkit ‚Äì Y Tiwtiadur ‚Äì which draws directly on the data from the corpus to provide resources for Welsh language learning at all ages and levels. Launched in September 2020, CorCenCC is the first corpus of the Welsh language that includes all three aspects of contemporary Welsh: spoken, written and electronically mediated (e-language). Composition CorCenCC extends to 11 million words of naturally occurring Welsh language (note: the version of the corpus available on the CorCenCC website reports results in tokens rather than words). The creation of CorCenCC was a community-driven project, which offered users of Welsh an opportunity to contribute to a Welsh language resource that reflects how Welsh is currently used. The dataset, therefore, offers a snapshot of the Welsh language across a range of contexts of use, e.g. private conversations, group socialising, business and other work situations, in education, in the various published media, and in public spaces. A full list of contexts, genres and topics included are available on the project's website. Conversations were recorded by the research team, and a crowdsourcing app enabled Welsh speakers in the community to record and upload samples of their own language use to the corpus. The published CorCenCC corpus was sampled from a range of different speakers and users of Welsh, from all regions of Wales, of all ages and genders, with a wide range of occupations, and with a variety of linguistic backgrounds (e.g. how they came to speak Welsh), to reflect the diversity of text types and of Welsh speakers found in contemporary Wales.

Frick cared for the fliers, sometimes with true kindness, but kept them imprisoned and ignorant of the war's conclusion. The fliers spend their time recalling the past and dreaming of escape. One of the fliers works on a book of his boyhood recollections. Frick is stricken with a heart attack and releases his fliers. He feels a bond with the fliers and begs to be allowed to stay with them as their servant in England. Production Sidney Lumet was the director. Adrian Spies wrote the teleplay, which was adapted from an English novel by Robert Shaw.

The ≈ªele≈Ñski family's coat of arms is the Cio≈Çek coat of arms, which is one of the oldest in medieval Poland. The ≈ªele≈Ñski family reached notable power under the late Piast dynasty, under the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, during the Partitions of Poland, and in the 20th and 21st centuries.  Origins  The ≈ªele≈Ñski family have been actors in the history of Poland since the 11th century.

History  The surname became noted for its many branches in the region, each house acquiring a status and influence which was envied by the princes of the region. In their later history, the name became a power unto themselves and were elevated to the ranks of nobility as they grew into this most influential family. In 1801, the ≈ªele≈Ñski family's nobility was recognized by the Habsburg Monarchy / Austrian Empire / Kingdom of Hungary. In 1803, it was then recognized by the Kingdom of Poland, and again officially in 1823 with title confirmation. The noble title is now honored by the Polish Republic for the ≈ªele≈Ñski Family Foundation's major contributions to educational and infrastructure sectors. From 1912 onwards it was an acknowledged noble family by England due to the ≈ªele≈Ñski family's wealth and business contacts in the British Monarchy, though England did not ever recognize its sovereignty. In 1982, England officially recognized the ≈ªele≈Ñski family and the ≈ªele≈Ñski Family Foundation (Polish: Fundacja Rodziny ≈ªele≈Ñskich) for their support in the 'Blackout Era' of Britian, as well as for their generous wedding gift to Princess Diana and Prince Charles in the form of a multi-million dollar donation to a selection of Princess Diana's charities, including the Middlesex Hospital AIDS ward, The Leprosy Mission, Centrepoint, and the English National Ballet.

Early life  Nilla Cram Cook was born in Davenport, Iowa, the daughter of playwright George Cram Cook and his second wife, journalist Mollie Anastasia Price. Her father and stepmother Susan Glaspell brought her to Greece as a girl, to study languages and culture there.  Career  In 1931, Cook left her husband in Greece and brought her young son to Kashmir, where she became a follower of Gandhi, converted to Hinduism, and studied Sanskrit, Hindi, and Persian literatures. After she left Gandhi's ashram, with a shaved head and barefoot, she crashed a car, and was detained as a vagrant and hospitalized for a month in 1934, in Calcutta, then deported with her son back to the United States. On arrival at Ellis Island, she made odd pronouncements (\\"delusions of grandeur\\", according to her brother), and news stories remarked on the \\"dramatic\\" and \\"hectic\\" scene. She wrote about this part of her life in a memoir, My Road to India (1939). Mary Sully painted an abstract portrait titled \\"Nila Cram Cook\\" in the 1930s. In 1939, she became Europe correspondent for an American weekly, Liberty. She covered World War II from Greece, until she escaped Nazi detention in July 1941, and fled with her son to Tehran. She worked as a cultural attach√© at the American Embassy in Tehran from 1941 to 1947. During that time, Cook converted to Islam, and spent years on a personal project, editing and translating the Koran into English, with her own commentary. She held a high position in Iran's Ministry of Education, oversaw film censorship, and went on radio to read her translations of poetry. She helped build national theatre, ballet, and opera programs in Iran in the 1940s. She worked with a fellow American expatriate, dancer Xenia Zarina, in Iran. Cook took a renewed interest in Kashmir in 1954, and compiled a book of translated poems, titled The Way of the Swan: Poems of Kashmir (1958).  Personal life  At age 18, in 1927, Nilla Cram Cook married Greek poet and government official Nikos Proestopoulos; they had a son, Serios Nicholas Proestopoulos (also known as Sirius Cook), and divorced in 1932. She married again very briefly, to Albert Nathaniel Hutchins in 1934; that marriage was annulled. Cook toured in Greece with her son and cousin and their wives in 1965.

Since August 2020, a second suspension bridge over the Hokitika River at the gorge provides the opportunity for a round track. Location The Hokitika Gorge was ground out of granite by the Hokitika River. The gorge is a 40-minute drive of inland from Hokitika, located in the South Island's West Coast. History Picnic party at the Hokitika Gorge in 1910 MƒÅori people crossed the Southern Alps from the headwaters of the Rakaia River via Rurumataikau (later named Whitcombe Pass after Henry Whitcombe) and reached the West Coast via Hokitika Gorge. Whitcombe and Joseph Lauper made this crossing in 1863 (Whitcombe would soon after drown on the same journey in the Taramakau River) searching for a suitable road link between Canterbury and the West Coast to profit from the West Coast Gold Rush (the route was far too challenging and soon after, Arthur's Pass was chosen instead). In 1865, Julius von Haast explored the Hokitika River by canoe but did not get beyond Hokitika Gorge as the river was too swift. Gerhard Mueller, the chief surveyor for Westland, revived the discussion about a road over Whitcombe Pass in 1880 but nothing came of this. The earliest recorded gold mining in the gorge was in 1887. In 1898, 50 possums were released to establish a fur trade. In 1900, the Westland Acclimatisation Society was given four moose calves imported from Canada and these were released at the gorge. The last moose was sighted in 1914 and it is believed that they never bred. In 1906, the Westland Acclimatisation Society applied for government support for tourism opportunities. The government responded by building a road to Hokitika Gorge. In March 1914, William Massey was the first prime minister to visit the gorge and he was most impressed by the scenic beauty. The first commercial tours from Hokitika to the gorge were available from 1922. In 1953, were gazetted by the government as a scenic reserve known as Hokitika Gorge Scenic Reserve. In 2004, Air Walkways Ltd applied for a consent for a canopy walkway at Hokitika Gorge. There was strong public opposition to the proposal and the Department of Conservation turned down the application in May 2006. Some years later, the West Coast Treetop Walk at Lake Mahinapua was instead built by a different different. =Bridges= In 1924, the Minister of Public Works, Gordon Coates, promised funding for a footbridge over the gorge. But it was not until 1930 that serious moves were made to build a bridge. A simple suspension bridge suitable to get people and livestock across the river opened in October 1933, jointly funded by the government (NZ¬£100) and Westland County Council (NZ¬£250). This bridge still exists and is now the lower (downstream) bridge. On 16 August 2020, the Department of Conservation opened a second suspension bridge. At , it is one of New Zealand's longest suspension bridges. It crosses the river upstream from the 1933 bridge where an island is located in the river; the bridge leads through the treetops on the island. At the same time, a new track opened that turned the previous one-way track into a loop track through Hokitika Gorge Scenic Reserve. Tourism Some 40,000 people visit the Hokitika Gorge per year, making it the third-most popular tourist attraction in the Hokitika area according to Tripadvisor.
