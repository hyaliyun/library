Its name was derived from the grouping of Flemish settlers who made their homes in this landlocked valley, in the municipality of Horta. The population in 2011 was 1,604, in an area of 14.62 km¬≤.Eurostat It contains the localities Cruz do Bravo, Farrobo, Lameiro Grande, Rua Nova, S√£o Louren√ßo and Tafoneiro. History The chapel of S√£o Jo√£o, in the foothills of Flamengos is the focus of annual festivals on 24 June The first settlers that arrived in the area that became known as the Vale dos Flamengos (, or literally, Valley of the Flemish people), were seeking a sheltered area that provided access to potable water. Their original beachhead, on the Lomba dos Frades, in the Praia do Almoxarife valley was a disaster for the first Captain-Donat√°rio Josse van Huerter (in 1465. His return in 1466-67 began a new phase in the island's history; discovering the fertile and sheltered geomorphology of the interior valley allowed the group of Flemish settlers to establish a foothold on the island (1468).Daniel, Lu√≠s; Soares, Natacha, eds (2003) , p.124 These early colonizers cultivated small parcels of land along the river, taking advantage of the springs and fertile volcanic soils, cultivating oranges, corn, legumes, as well as servicing the town and other parishes on the island. The community's primitive church (dedicated to Nossa Senhora da Luz) was constructed shortly after the first settlers established their homes, and was a large three-nave over five pillars, sturdy and well constructed (as the historian Gaspar Frutuoso recounted in his Saudades da Terra). In 1597, Flamengos was raided by English privateers, who remained in the valley for days, pillaging and destroying homes. In 1606 the village of Flamengos had been restored, through the assistance of Jer√≥nimo de Utra Corte Real, and later expanded in 1736, through the initiatives of Manuel Brum da Silveira. Raul Brand√£o, in his As Ilhas Desconhecidas (1926), described the parish in these terms: \\"This use to be more animated and rich. Everything around Horta and Flamengos was houses, orchards full of oranges, plants and flowers, the Estate of S√£o Louren√ßo, the Estate of the Silveiras, the Estate of the Dabneys...\\". Brand√£o was referring to a period when the wealthy, rich property owners and farmers had their summer homes and estates within the valley: by 1926, the area was less important for the upwardly mobile, who concentrated in their salons in Horta. On 31 December 1936, a violent earthquake destroyed most of the buildings and homes in the parish. Unfortunately, a similar event occurred on 23 November 1973 and later on 9 June 1998, which permanently destroyed the church of Nossa Senhora da Luz (). The church was rebuilt and inaugurated on 3 April 2016. Geography The valley of Flamengos, in the foothills of the central caldera, as seen from Monte Carneiro The Ribeira dos Flamengos, a constant water source for early settlers Flamengos is located about 5 minutes (and 5 kilometers) from the centre of Horta, via several ancillary roadways along the eastern and southern margins of the Atlantic Ocean. The Flamengos valley is an \\"amphitheater\\"-shaped area, relatively planar and intersected by ravines that extend from the slopes of the Cabe√ßo do Fogo. Farmlands dominate the eastern areas and the Flamengos valley, although the flanks of the mountain are used as pastureland and forests. Much of the population is employed in agriculture business, primarily dairy production. = Ecoregions/protected areas= *Parque Florestal de Falca (') Economy The agricultural characteristics of the parish are well known and in cases represent the characteristics of Beiras and Beiras e Tr√°s-os-Montes. The chimneys represent the typical characteristics of southern Portugal. Architecture =Civic= * Fountain of the Bicas (), located along the Rua do Capit√£o was a public fountain used until 1852; it was one of the few fountains used as a public laundry, used communally by the residents of the village, and may have pre-dated the creation of the parish; * Bridge of Flamengos (), this bridge, another symbol of early 20th Century construction, was begun in 1903 and completed by 1908. * Estate of S√£o Louren√ßo (), the old property of Tom√°s de Porra Pereira, former Captain-Donatorio of Faial, and recently transferred to the islands's Servi√ßos Agr√°rios do Faial ('), where for many years it has been used as the location of the island's fairs, expositions, folklore festivals and other activities. * Botanical Garden of Faial (), an interpretative center for common endemic and endangered plants, as well as many varieties of medicinal herbs, used by local residents on the island; =Religious= * Hermitage of S√£o Jo√£o Baptista (), the chapel is located at a junction of the Estrada da Caldeira (Largo Jaime Melo-Estrada da Ribeira Funda) in the foothills of the central caldera, an access that islanders traditionally used for pilgrimages () to the caldera on the feast day of John the Baptist (24 June).Daniel, Lu√≠s; Soares, Natacha, eds (2003), p.127 The erection of a hermitage/chapel came from Manuel da Silveira Brum (who had a summer residence there) and the parish vicar Father Jo√£o Goulart Cardoso. From the placing of the cornerstone (24 June 1921) the responsibility for the chapel's construction fell to the proprietor and was supported by donations from the local congregation. But the project ran slowly, then stopped in 1925, before being restarted by a stipend from Jos√© Rodrigues de Amaral, before his death. In 1944 the chapel was concluded, and blessed on the annual feast day by Father Ant√≥nio S. de Medeiros, and the first mass held by Father Goulart Cardoso. The isolated chapel is constructed from basaltic stone in the form of a central nave and tower (constructed over the main entranceway). Culture Traditionally, Flamengos has been the centre of annual S√£o Jo√£o da Caldeira celebrations (or simply Festas de S√£o Jo√£o) on the island, held on 23‚Äì24 June. These festivals, which have occurred popularly since the 15th-16th century, included pilgrimages from around the island that journeyed to the central caldera, where they would play music, danced and jumped bonfires during the quasi-religious festivities. While the religious pilgrimages were discontinued, the annual festivities continued as a social event with popular marches, food kiosks, picnicking, dances and the community Fogueira de S√£o Jo√£o (bonfire) highlighting the celebration around midnight. Meanwhile, the following day (24 June) is a municipal holiday (island-wide), that includes a mid-day eucharistic celebration at the hermitage of S√£o Jo√£o (along the intersection of the Estrada Regional E.R.1-2¬™ and Rua da Caldeira, midway towards the summit of the caldera). A community lunch, that includes sardines, musical groups, popular marches, exhibitions, traditional folklore dances are held within the shadow of the small chapel, and rounds out the celebrations. The Sociedade Filarm√≥nica Nova Artista Flamenguese (), founded on 23 January 1881, was the first band established in Flamengos. Between 1899 and 1912, its musical director was Maestro Francisco Xavier Simaria, but today M√°rio Francisco Leal Abreu is currently conducting the brass band. Besides this, there is the Tuna e Grupo Folcl√≥rico Juvenil dos Flamengos () was founded in 1978 by Ant√≥nio da Luz Rodrigues, who served as its director, which recently (1 March 1999) established an ancillary group, the Grupo de Cantares Sons do Vale ().

It is the final installment of the DisneyToon's Mickey Mouse movies. A sequel to Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas (1999), the film features Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Pluto, Goofy, Max, Donald Duck, Daisy Duck, Huey, Dewey, and Louie and Scrooge McDuck in five different segments. Stories The narrator recites the first ten words of The Night Before Christmas before saying, \\"Oh, wait. Different story, but we'll still see a mouse\\". The narrator then announces new tales of giving and loving, and a book opens to show pop-up elves. =Belles on Ice= The narrator said it all started on the first segment when Minnie Mouse and Daisy Duck were competing in an ice skating competition. The girls each are joined by their boyfriends, Mickey and Donald, as they prepare to take the ice. Daisy becomes envious of the crowd's reaction to Minnie and attempts to steal the spotlight for herself. Minnie performs several daredevil stunts to regain the spotlight while Daisy summons the Fantasia Hippos, who become her backup skaters while her counterpart summons the alligators from the 1940 film. Fed up, Daisy and Minnie argue and shove each other, putting each other at risk and then try pulling dramatic stunts to draw the attention of the crowds as Mickey and Donald watch with worry. When Minnie accidentally slips on a fallen handbell while landing from a stunt blindfolded, Daisy helps Minnie up while feeling sorry for her actions. Minnie feels the same way, and they perform a grand finale. =Christmas: Impossible= The second segment tells the story of Huey, Dewey, and Louie celebrating Christmas Eve with Donald and Daisy Duck at Uncle Scrooge's mansion in Duckburg. After causing trouble at dinnertime, the boys know that they are on the naughty list for sure, so they travel to the North Pole to write their names on Santa's good list. At Santa's workshop, the trio cause more trouble such as messing the elves' jobs up, but they and the elves help clean up the mess and save Christmas. Before they leave, they luck into an opportunity to add their names to the good list; however, they add Uncle Scrooge's name instead, mindful of the fact that he was never written onto the list either. On Christmas Day, Santa leaves them a note that explains that their actions have caused them to be also put on the good list. =Christmas Maximus= The third segment's focus is about Max Goof and his father Goofy celebrating the holidays. A young adult Max brings home his girlfriend Mona to meet his father, Goofy. However, Max is unsure whether or not he wants Mona to meet his dad (Most of the story takes place within the song \\"Make Me Look Good\\"). Max at first is embarrassed by his dad, who shows baby pictures to Mona and wipes cocoa off Max's face. While wondering outside, he notices that his scarf is made by Goofy and realizes that Goofy is always, well, goofy, and that is why he loves him. Max then forgets about being embarrassed and decides to join in the fun when the popcorn making machine goes haywire. Max tries to stop the machine but has popcorn filling his clothes until he lets go. He becomes embarrassed after having his clothes inflate in front of his girlfriend, Mona and flies across the room. Goofy tries to stop it next, but he is swung around in the air by the machine. Max, Goofy and Mona are all pushed up by the popcorn through the chimney and onto the roof. Following this, Mona then reveals to have the same kind of teeth like Goofy and Max; they all laugh and make snow angels on the roof. =Donald's Gift= The fourth segment focuses on Donald Duck and his Christmas wish of peace and quiet. Daisy Duck and Huey, Dewey, and Louie also appear. As Donald returns home from grocery shopping, he daydreams and misses his bus. He runs to catch after it, but he is slowed down by a series of well- wishers that begin to sing \\"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\\". Donald becomes increasingly annoyed by the joyous people, and at home, he is annoyed to hear the same Christmas carols on his radio. When Daisy and his nephews arrive, Donald becomes annoyed that they want to go out so soon after he returned home, but Daisy drags him out. At the mall, Donald grabs a cup of hot chocolate and discovers various objects seeming to play the same Christmas carol; Donald thinks he is in complete peace inside a secret room, where he finds animatronics singing. Donald immediately wrecks them until he notices he is destroying the show at Mousy's that Daisy, Huey, Dewey, and Louie and also the crowd were trying to see; Dewey tricks Donald into being heartbroken by saying Donald is not their uncle anymore, and Daisy agrees to leave with the boys. After he is thrown out of the mall by the mall guard for his lack of Christmas spirit and destroying the Mousy's show, Donald walks home alone while feeling guilty for his lack of Christmas spirit. He finds Christmas carolers having trouble with singing \\"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\\", to which he urges to mentor the performers in singing. The other town residents join in to sing along. When Daisy, Huey, Dewey and Louie arrive, Donald apologizes and everyone happily sings the song, eventually Donald, who gets used to it. =Mickey's Dog-Gone Christmas= The fifth and final segment stars Mickey as he makes decorations for the Christmas party, which Pluto keeps interrupting. When Pluto attempts to help by putting the star on the tree, he inadvertently destroys all the decorations (especially knocking down the Christmas tree), causing a frustrated Mickey yells at his dog, and sends Pluto to his doghouse as a punishment. Feeling like he is rejected from his owner, Pluto decides to run away from home and then finds himself shipped to the North Pole, where Santa's reindeer adopt him. Back at home, Mickey redecorates the house and, ashamed of how he unleashed his anger at Pluto, attempts to reconcile with him, only to find him missing. Mickey posts several \\"lost dog\\" posters and eventually turns to a department store Santa, who turns out to be the real one. Meanwhile, Pluto becomes homesick to which Santa and the reindeer help Pluto return home. As Mickey's friends arrive, Pluto completes the Christmas tree decorations and everyone celebrates Pluto's return, even Donald and Daisy Duck, who had just showed up with Huey, Dewey and Louie, Uncle Scrooge, Max, Goofy and Minnie Mouse (who is also entranced by the decorations). The film concludes with a medley of various carols as the book closes.

Robert Pardi of TV Guide rated the film 3/5 stars and wrote, \\"A candy-cane palate and a festive soundtrack bolster this omnibus, which allows Disney favorites a chance to strut some new stuff.\\" References External links * * Category:2004 films Category:English-language films Category:2004 computer-animated films Category:2004 direct-to-video films Category:2000s Christmas comedy films Category:2000s fantasy-comedy films Category:2000s children's comedy films Category:2000s American animated films Category:American films Category:American anthology films Category:American children's animated comedy films Category:American children's animated fantasy films Category:American Christmas comedy films Category:American computer-animated films Category:American sequel films Category:Animated Christmas films Category:Direct-to-video sequel films Category:DisneyToon Studios animated films Category:Disney direct-to-video animated films Category:Mickey Mouse films Category:Donald Duck films Category:Goofy (Disney) films Category:Films directed by Matthew O'Callaghan Category:2004 comedy films ","title":"Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas"},{"id":"1166827","text":"Martin Puryear, M√©tissage / Camouflage, 2016 Bearing Witness at the Environmental Protection Agency, Ronald Reagan Building, Washington, DC Martin L. Puryear (born May 23, 1941) is an American artist known for his devotion to traditional craft. Working in wood and bronze, among other media, his reductive technique and meditative approach challenge the physical and poetic boundaries of his materials.Shearer, Linda. Young American Artists 1978 Exxon National Exhibition. New York: The Solomon Guggenheim Museum, 1978 The artist's Martin Puryear: Liberty/Libert√† exhibition represented the United States at the 2019 Venice Biennale. Life Born in 1941 in Washington, D.C., Martin Puryear began exploring traditional craft methods in his youth, making tools, boats, musical instruments, and furniture.Lewallen, Constance. Martin Puryear: Matrix/Berkeley 86. Berkeley, California: University Art Museum, 1985 After receiving a BA in Fine Art from the Catholic University of America in 1963, Puryear spent two years as a Peace Corps volunteer in Sierra Leone where he learned local woodworking techniques.Elderfield, John. Martin Puryear. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 2007 From 1966‚Äì1968, he studied at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm, returning to the United States afterward to enroll in the graduate program for sculpture at Yale University.Benezra, Newal and Robert Storr, eds. Martin Puryear. Chicago: The Art Institute of Chicago, 1991 Although he discovered Minimalism at a formative period in his development, Puryear would ultimately reject its impersonality and formalism. After earning his MFA from Yale, Puryear began teaching at Fisk University in Nashville and University of Maryland in College Park. In 1977, following a devastating fire in his Brooklyn studio, Puryear had a solo show at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington. Shortly after he moved to Chicago. In both 1979 and 1981, and again in 1989, his work was included in the Whitney Biennial at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City. He travelled to Japan in 1982 through a Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship where he investigated architecture and garden design. In 1989, he was awarded the MacArthur Foundation Fellowship. He received the Gold Medal in Sculpture by the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2007, and was recently awarded the National Medal of Arts. Puryear has lived in New York's Hudson Valley since 1990 where he works in a studio of his own construction. An African-American, he does not speak frequently about his identity but has expressed appreciation for the life of James Beckwourth. Artwork (selection) The artwork of Martin Puryear is a product of visibly complex craft construction and manipulation of pure material; its forms are combinations of the organic and the geometric. His process can be described as reductive, seeking to bring work and material close to its original state and creating rationality in each work derived from the maker and act of making. This is what Puryear calls \\"inevitability\\", or a \\"fullness of being within limits\\" that defines function. Often associated with both Minimalism and Formalist sculpture, Puryear rejects that his work is ever non-referential or objective. The pure and direct imagistic forms born from his use of traditional craft are allusive and poetic, as well as deeply personal. Visually, they encounter the history of objects and the history of their making, suggesting public and private narratives including those of the artist, race, ritual, and identity.Golden, Deven K., ed. Martin Puryear: Public and Personal. Chicago: Chicago Public Library Cultural Center, 1987. His work is widely exhibited and collected both in the United States and internationally. Included amongst Puryear's public works is his large-scale composition Ark (1988) which was designed for York College and can be viewed presently on the school's campus in Queens, New York. Puryear has also created several permanent outdoor works, such as Bodark Arc (1982) and Pavilion in the Trees (1993), and collaborated with landscape architects on the design of public spaces. A 30-year survey, organized by the Museum of Modern Art, New York and which traveled to the National Gallery of Art, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, included installations of some of the artist's largest works, notably the dramatically foreshortened 36-foot Ladder for Booker T. Washington (1996) made from a single, split sapling ash tree. = Bask, 1976 = Bask rests low on the floor in black, made of staved pine wood tapered at each end and swelling gently at the center. The subtle curvature of the work is achieved through the use of a ship making technique called strip planking once used to build the hulls of ships. Geometric in its construction of lines and arcs, it demonstrates well the influence of Minimalism in the early work of Martin Puryear. = Ark, 1988 = Martin Puryear's 36 foot tall and 70 foot long copper tubing installation, Ark, was constructed in 1987 and installed on the campus of York College in 1988 where it can be viewed to this day. Ark was commissioned by the college as a result of New York City's Percent for Art law. York approached Puryear in 1981 and his proposal for Ark was submitted in 1985. The armature made of copper tubing consists of looping and intertwined oval and circular shapes, swelling slightly at the center and sagging at the bottom, evoking the skeletal framework of a ship's hull. Puryear designed Ark specifically for the location in which it hangs, suspended from rafters by cables in the Academic Core Building. The piece was mounted in the space between the glass walls of the library and the second and third floor balconies. The installation floats unobtrusively in the soft, natural light that filters through the Academic Core Mall and reflects imagery consistent with recurring motifs of Puryear's work such as ships and embryonic forms which are visible in pieces such as, Bask (1976) in which both the shape and construction of ships is referenced by the piece's form and the technique used to build it.Brenson, Michael. \\"Review/Art; Works for Urban College Raise Hard Questions.\\" The New York Times, 8 Apr. 1988, www.nytimes.com/1988/04/08/arts/review-art-works-for-urban-college-raise-hard- questions.html?pagewanted=all.Elderfield, John, and Michael Auping. Martin Puryear: Museum of Modern Art, 2007. = The Load, 2012 = Lacking any means of conveyance, the full-size two-wheeled cart in The Load sits poised as if ready to move at a moment's notice, with its twelve-foot harness pole parallel to the ground resting on a center prop. Mounted atop the axle of the cart is a gridded wooden box that encages a white sphere fitted with a glass aperture. The glass aperture faces the rear of the cart, an accessible portal through which a viewer can glimpse the complex interior structure of the wooden sphere. The cart is an immediately recognizable object, although from no particular time or place in history. Two-wheeled carts have been in use since the second millennium BCE, and are common in cultures worldwide, making it both culturally and temporally ambiguous.Levi Strauss, David. Martin Puryear: New Sculpture. New York: McKee Gallery, 2012 In futuristic white, the sphere juxtaposes the aged wood of the cart. The Load revisits the wheel as an object with functional and symbolic meanings in the work of Puryear, who often deals with escapism, flight, and mobility.

During Lent, Roman Catholics and some other Christians traditionally abstained from the consumption of meat and poultry, hence the term \\"carnival\\", from carnelevare, \\"to remove (literally, \\"raise\\") meat.\\" Rhythm, participation, and costumes vary from one region of Brazil to another. In the southeastern cities of Rio de Janeiro, S√£o Paulo, and Vit√≥ria, huge organized parades are led by samba schools. Those official parades are meant to be watched by the public, while minor parades (blocos) allowing public participation can be found in other cities, like Belo Horizonte, also in the southeastern region. The northeastern cities of Recife, Olinda, Salvador, and Porto Seguro have organized groups parading through streets, and public interacts directly with them. This carnival is also influenced by African-Brazilian culture. It is a six-day party where crowds follow the trios el√©tricos through the city streets, dancing and singing. Also in northeast, Olinda carnival features unique characteristics, heavily influenced by local folklore and cultural manifestations, such as Frevo and Maracatu. The typical genres of music of Brazilian carnival are, in the Southeast Region in general, mostly cities of Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo: the samba-enredo, the samba de bloco, the samba de embalo and the marchinha; and in the Northeast Region including Pernambuco (mostly cities of Olinda and Recife): frevo and maracatu, and Bahia (mostly the city of Salvador): samba- reggae, pagode (also a type of Samba) and the main genre ax√© music; all of which are linked back to Afro-Brazilian culture. Carnival is the most popular holiday in Brazil and has become an event of huge proportions. Except for industrial production, retail establishments such as malls, and carnival- related businesses, the country unifies completely for almost a week and festivities are intense, day and night, mainly in coastal cities. Rio de Janeiro's carnival alone drew 4.9 million people in 2011, with 400,000 being foreigners. This cultural manifestation is generally an extension of Afro- Brazilian culture, though could also be historically traced to the Portuguese Age of Discoveries when their caravels passed regularly through Madeira, a territory which already celebrated emphatically its carnival season, and where they were loaded with goods but also people and their ludic and cultural expressions. By Region  = Rio de Janeiro = Crowds watch the Carnaval parade in the Sambadrome Marqu√™s de Sapuca√≠, in Rio de Janeiro. In the late 18th century, the \\"cord√µes\\" (literally \\"cords\\", laces or strings in Portuguese) combined with the \\"dan√ßa do coco\\" (literally \\"coconut dance\\" an Afro-Brazilian dance troupe form) were introduced in Rio de Janeiro. These were pageant groups that paraded through city avenues performing on instruments and dancing. Today they are known as Carnaval blocos (blocks), consisting of a group of people who dress in costumes or special T-shirts with themes and/or logos. Blocos are generally associated with particular neighbourhoods; they include both a percussion or music group and an entourage of revelers. They eventually became the \\"fathers\\" of what everyone today knows as the famous and internationally renowned samba-schools in Brazil. Samba- schools (not only in Rio de Janeiro, but in S√£o Paulo and several other cities) are the cultural epicenter of the Brazilian carnival, in terms of the \\"parading style\\". The first registered samba-school was called \\"Deixa-falar\\", but disappeared later and the first official samba-school contest happened in 1929, with only three groups, and \\"Oswaldo Cruz\\" group won the competition, with a samba written by Heitor dos Prazeres. GRES Esta√ß√£o Primeira de Mangueira Samba-School, represented by Cartola, and Est√°cio de S√° samba School, represented by Ismael Silva, were the other 2 contestants. Eventually, \\"Oswaldo Cruz\\" became Portela Samba School, the greatest winner of Rio's Carnival with 22 Titles. Although many Brazilians tend now to favor other forms of national music culture to that of Rio's samba schools, the carnival of Rio de Janeiro remains the national festival par excellence, and the samba of Rio de Janeiro continues to be an agent of national unification.Vianna H, The Mystery of Samba: Popular Music and National Identity in Brazil, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro 1995, trans. Chasteen J, University of North Carolina Press 1999. p.107. Samba dance Carnaval blocos, also known as Blocos de Rua (\\"Street Blocks\\") occur in nearly every neighborhood throughout the city and metropolitan areas, but the most famous are the ones in Copacabana, Ipanema, Leblon, Lagoa, Jardim Bot√¢nico, and in downtown Rio. Organizers often compose their own music themes that are added to the performance and singing of classic \\"marchinhas\\" and samba popular songs. \\"Cord√£o do bola preta\\" (\\"Polka Dot Bloco\\"), that goes through the heart of Rio's historical center, and \\"Suvaco do Cristo\\" ('Armpit of Christ the Redeemer', referring to the angle of the statue seen from the neighborhood), near the Botanical Garden, are some of the most famous groups. Monobloco has become so famous that it plays all year round at parties and small concerts. The formalized samba schools are very small groups of performers, financed by respected organizations (as well as legal gambling groups), who work year- round in preparation for Carnival. Samba Schools perform in the Sambadrome, which runs four entire nights and is overseen by LIESA. They are part of an official competition, divided into seven divisions, in which a single school is declared the winner, according to ten judging categories that include costume, flow, theme, and band music quality and performance. Some samba schools also hold street parties in their neighborhoods, through which they parade along with their followers. All performers at the Sambadrome have to wear a costume. Some honored members of the school or community may receive one for free, but normally, most will have to pay for their own. Tourists can have the same experience on the \\"Commercial Area\\" of some Samba Schools but need to buy their own costume from the school, or through an agent, either of which can be quite costly. =Bahia= Circuit Barra-Ondina, the most famous line of Brazil where attractions sing above the trio el√©trico in the city of Salvador, Bahia There are several major differences between Carnival in the state of Bahia in Northeastern Brazil and Carnival in Rio de Janeiro. The musical styles are different at each carnival; in Bahia there are many rhythms, including samba, samba-reggae, ax√©, etc., while in Rio there is the multitude of samba styles: the \\"samba-enredo\\", the \\"samba de bloco\\", the \\"samba de embalo\\", the \\"funk-samba\\", as well as the famous \\"marchinhas\\" played by the \\"bandas\\" in the streets. Carnival circuit of the city of Salvador. In the 1880s, the black population commemorated the days of Carnival in its own way, highly marked by Yoruba characteristics, dancing in the streets playing instruments. This form was thought of as \\"primitive\\" by the upper-class white elite, and the groups were banned from participating in the official Bahia Carnival, dominated by the local conservative elite. The groups defied the ban and continued to do their dances. By the 1970s, four main types of carnival groups developed in Bahia: Afox√™s, Trios El√©tricos, \\"Amerindian\\" groups, and Blocos Afros. Afox√™s use the rhythms of the African inspired religion, Candombl√©. They also worship the gods of Candombl√©, called orix√°s. An Electric Trio is characterized by a truck equipped with giant speakers and a platform where musicians play songs of local genres such as ax√©. People follow the trucks singing and dancing. The \\"Amerindian\\" groups were inspired by Western movies from the United States. The groups dress up as Native Americans and take on Native American names. Blocos Afros, or Afro groups, were influenced by the Black Pride Movement in the United States, independence movements in Africa, and reggae music that denounced racism and oppression. The groups inspired a renewed pride in African heritage. Today, Bahia's carnival consists mostly of Trios El√©tricos, but there are still Blocos Afros and Afox√™s. Every year, about half a million tourists are attracted to Salvador. It's also possible to watch everything from the Camarotes (ringside seats) spread out along the way, offering more comfort to the visitors. =Pernambuco= Recife Carnival, in the capital city of the State of Pernambuco, Recife. The North East state of Pernambuco has unique Carnivals in its present capital Recife and in its colonial capital Olinda. Their main rhythms are the frevo and the maracatu. Galo da Madrugada is the biggest carnival parade in the world, considering the number of participants, according The Guinness Book of World Records. It means \\"dawn's rooster\\" and parades, as the name suggests, in the morning only. Frevo is Pernambucan-style dance with African and acrobatic influences, as it is fast and electrifying, often using an open umbrella and frequent legs and arms movements. Unlike Salvador and Rio, the festivities in Recife, Olinda and Itamaraca do not include group competitions. Instead, groups dance and play instruments side by side. Tro√ßas and maracatus, mostly of African influence, begin one week before Carnival and end a week later. = S√£o Paulo= Carnival parade in S√£o Paulo, Gavi√µes da Fiel Torcida Samba School. The carnival in S√£o Paulo takes place in the Anhembi Sambadrome on the Friday and Saturday night of the week of Carnival, as opposed to Rio's Carnival, which is held on Sunday and Monday night. Various \\"samba schools\\" compete in a huge parade. Each school presents a different theme, which they expose through their costumes, dance, music, and the allegorical cars or \\"carros aleg√≥ricos\\", huge vehicles decorated according to the theme designed specifically for the parade. The schools are responsible for choosing their own themes, which usually revolve around historical happenings or some sort of cultural or political movement. Vai-Vai is the oldest school and has been the Special Group champion most times (15 total, including the 2015 championship). It also is the most popular, for it has a larger fan base and many supporters among the people of the city. = Esp√≠rito Santo= The Carnival in Vit√≥ria are performed one week before Carnival, more precisely in Samb√£o do Povo. The schools are responsible for choosing their own themes, which usually revolve around historical happenings or some sort of cultural or political movement. More than the traditional school parade, the carnival in Espirito Santos includes a large set of attractions, especially in the beach areas of the state, from north to south. =Minas Gerais= Carnival parade of Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais. Minas also holds some important carnival parades in Belo Horizonte and the historic cities of Ouro Preto, Mariana, S√£o Jo√£o del Rei, and Diamantina. They are held mostly by students' houses, which attract a majority of young people from the neighbor states. There are also other major parades in the region, such as the one in Pomp√©u. Carnival in Minas Gerais is often characterized by blocos carnavalescos with varying themes and costume styles, almost always accompanied by a brass and drums band. However, Minas Gerais carnival was first influenced by the Rio de Janeiro Carnival (several cities have their own samba schools). Later, some Ax√© groups from Bahia came to play in the state every carnival season. The first carnival party in Belo Horizonte happened in 1897, even before the inauguration of the city. In 2017, Belo Horizonte had the largest carnival in its history and the third largest in Brazil. There were more than three million people on the streets, with about 500,00 tourists. The Baianas Ozadas block hit a record audience of 500,000 people. The Carnival of the city of Ouro Preto is very popular with college students in the area. The city has a large proportion of students, who during the year live in places called Rep√∫blicas (a rented house maintained and ruled by themselves). During carnival, the Rep√∫blicas are literally packed with residents and many visitors coming from all over the country. The hills prevent traffic of heavy sound trucks, but don't stop people from feasting all night and day. The Carnival of the city of Juiz de Fora is that already came to be in the mid 80, one of the three largest carnivals in Brazil. that is currently falling on descredito due to deadlock between the League in the organization of the parades of the samba schools between LIESJUF and Funalfa, not having parades in the city since 2016. now being the LIESB, which administers the parades in Intendente Magalh√£es as their mediator in the management of the carnival. =Others= Some southern cities such as Uruguaiana, Florian√≥polis, Manaus, and Porto Alegre have smaller samba school groups or blocos, but like S√£o Paulo state towns, they seem to prefer balls to street dancing. Curitiba hosts modest carnival celebrations similar to those of other Brazilian cities and events such as Curitiba Rock Festival and a carnival Zombie Walk, all supported by Cultural Foundation of Curitiba which operates under supervision of government of Curitiba. Samb√≥dromo The Samb√≥dromo of Rio. The Carnival parades in Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo take place in their samb√≥dromos, located close to the city center. In the Rio Samb√≥dromo, the parades start at 20:00 or 21:00 (depending on the date) and end around 5:00 in the morning. The Rio de Janeiro Metro operates 24 hours during the main parade days. Music =Samba= Singer Carmen Miranda led samba to the world in her films. Originated in Rio de Janeiro between the end of the 19th century and the first years of the 20th century, the samba is still one of the most popular music styles of Brazil. From intimate samba- can√ß√µes (samba songs) sung in bars to explosive drum parades performed during carnival, samba always evokes a warm and vibrant mood. In the 1930s, a group of musicians led by Ismael Silva founded in the neighborhood of Est√°cio de S√° the first samba school, Deixa Falar. They transformed the musical genre to make it fit better the carnival parade. In this decade, the radio spread the genre's popularity all around the country, and with the support of the nationalist dictatorship of Get√∫lio Vargas, samba became Brazil's \\"official music.\\" In the following years, samba has developed in several directions, from the gentle samba-can√ß√£o to the drum orchestras which make the soundtrack of carnival parade. One of these new styles was bossa nova, a musical movement initially spearheaded by young musicians and college students from Rio de Janeiro. It got increasingly popular over time, with the works of Jo√£o Gilberto and Antonio Carlos Jobim. In the sixties, Brazil was politically divided, and the leftist musicians of bossa nova started to draw attention to the music made in the favelas. Many popular artists were discovered at this time. Names like Cartola, Nelson Cavaquinho, Velha Guarda da Portela, Z√© Keti, and Clementina de Jesus recorded their first albums. In the seventies, the samba got back to radio. Composers and singers like Martinho da Vila, Clara Nunes, and Beth Carvalho dominated the hit parade. In the beginning of the eighties, after having been sent to the underground due to styles like disco and Brazilian rock, Samba reappeared in the media with a musical movement created in the suburbs of Rio de Janeiro. It was the pagode, a renewed samba, with new instruments, like the banjo and the tantan, and a new language, more popular, filled with slang. The most popular names were Zeca Pagodinho, Almir Guineto, Grupo Fundo de Quintal, Jorge Arag√£o, and Jovelina P√©rola Negra. Various samba schools have been founded throughout Brazil. A samba school combines the dancing and party fun of a night club with the gathering place of a social club and the community feeling of a volunteer group. During the spectacular Rio Carnival, famous samba schools parade in the Samb√≥dromo. =Frevo= Frevo dancers. The Frevo was included on the UNESCO's list of intangible heritage. Frevo is a wide range of musical styles originating from Recife and Olinda, Pernambuco, Brazil, all of which are traditionally associated with Brazilian Carnival. The word frevo is said to come from frever, a misspeaking of the Portuguese word ferver (to boil). It is said that the sound of the frevo will make listeners and dancers to feel as they are boiling on the ground. The word frevo is normally used interchangeably either to mean the frevo music or the frevo dance. The frevo music came first. By the end of the 19th century, bands from the Brazilian Army regiments based in the city of Recife started a tradition of parading during the Carnival. Since the Carnival is originally linked to religion, they played religious procession marches and martial music, as well. A couple of regiments had famous bands which attracted many followers and it was just a matter of time to people start to compare one to another and cheer for their favorite bands. The two most famous bands were the Espanha (meaning Spain), whose conductor was of Spanish origin, and the 14, from the 14th regiment. The bands started to compete with each other and also started playing faster and faster, louder and louder. =Ax√©= The Brazilian ax√© singer Daniela Mercury. Ax√© is not exactly about a style or musical movement, but rather about a useful brand name given to artists from Salvador who made music upon northeastern Brazilian, Caribbean, and African rhythms with a pop-rock twist, which helped them take over the Brazilian hit parades since 1992. Ax√© is a ritual greeting used in Candombl√© and Umbanda religions, and means \\"good vibration.\\" The word music was attached to Ax√©, used as slang within the local music biz, by a journalist who intended to create a derogatory term for the pretentious dance-driven style. As singer Daniela Mercury began her rise to stardom in Rio and S√£o Paulo, anything coming from Salvador would be labeled Ax√© Music. Soon, the artists became oblivious to the derogatory origins of the term and started taking advantage of it. With the media pushing it forward, the soundtrack of Carnival in Salvador quickly spread over the country (through off-season Carnival shindigs), strengthening its industrial potentials and producing year-round hits along the 90s. Tested within the height of Carnival heat, Ax√© songs have been commercially successful in Brazil throughout the past decade. The year 1998 was particularly fortunate for the artists from Bahia: together, Daniela Mercury, Claudia Leitte, Ivete Sangalo, Asa de Aguia, Chiclete com Banana, Araketu, Cheiro de Amor, and √â o Tchan sold over 3.4 million records.  TV broadcasting  The Brazilian Carnival Parades were first broadcast in the late 1960s on television on Rede Globo, which brought the Rio celebrations live, bringing the celebrations to more people all over the nation. By the 1970s, color broadcasting and satellite transmissions made the broadcasts to be beamed to other parts of the nation in real time, by then featuring the top schools under, since 1984 the Liga Independente das Escolas de Samba do Rio de Janeiro - also known as the Special Group (since 1990), and formerly under the Associa√ß√£o das Escolas de Samba da Cidade do Rio de Janeiro. Now defunct, Rede Manchete broadcast the event on several occasions and mounted a joint broadcast with Globo for the 1987 event. Since 1991, Globo's broadcast of the parades, now dubbed Globeleza, at the Sambodrome in Rio and S√£o Paulo have become the center of national and international attention. Until 2017, fans of the samba schools on parade also expected to watch a short preview of the performances of the schools involved to be broadcast during the duration of the event. By 2018 lyric video style adverts appeared in their place, complete with the colours of the competing schools in attendance, featuring the lyrics of the songs to be performed by the schools. Globo acquired also the rights to air the parade of samba schools of S√£o Paulo in 1990, and victory parades there were later aired in other local TV channels. Parades belonging to the Access Group (5th Division) and the B Series schools in Rio were also broadcast on several TV stations and are still the case today (in 2015 Rede Record and NGT aired the parades of the lower-level schools). Since 2014, Globo also has full rights to the A Series (Rio) and Paulista parades, which were co-shared with the Viva Channel before its closure in 2015 (which aired lower-level parades and the victory parades of the two cities' winning schools for the year) and regionally, RBS airs the Carnivals of Florianop√≥lis and Porto Alegre, and since 2015, cable channel TVCOM display the gaucho parades in the south. The Rio parade can also be heard on radio and seen via online streaming as well (thru TVG Rio and from 2015 in G1, which offers an online live streaming of the victory parade). The Carnivals of Recife and Salvador are shown by Band since the early 2000s, and Band also holds broadcast rights for the victory parade. Both fall under the Band Folia brand. This is also the case for SBT which also broadcasts the events under the SBT Folia banner and is also, since recently, seen via live streaming on YouTube.

Darye literally refers to \\"etiquette for tea\\" or \\"tea rite\\" and has been kept among Korean people for over a thousand years.Heiss, Mary Lou and Heiss, Robert J. \\"The Story of Tea: A Cultural History and Drinking Guide\\". Berkeley: Ten Speed Press, 2007 p.197-8 The chief element of the Korean tea ceremony is the ease and naturalness of enjoying tea within an easy formal setting. Tea ceremonies are now being revived in Korea as a way to find relaxation and harmony in the fast-paced new Korean culture, and continuing in the long tradition of intangible Korean art. History = Early history = The first historical record documenting the offering of tea to an ancestral god describes a rite in the year 661 in which a tea offering was made to the spirit of King Suro, the founder of the Geumgwan Gaya Kingdom (42-562). Records from the Goryeo Dynasty (918-1392) show that tea offerings were made in Buddhist temples to the spirits of revered monks.An Sonjae (Brother Anthony of Taize) and Hong Kyeong-hae \\"The Korean Way of Tea: An Introductory Guide\\" (Seoul: Seoul Selection, 2007) p.90 Important national rituals involving tea drinking were being presided over by the government officials of the \\"Tabang\\" department.An Sonjae (Brother Anthony of Taize) and Hong Kyeong-hae \\"The Korean Way of Tea: An Introductory Guide\\" (Seoul: Seoul Selection, 2007) p.91 There is at least one ritual recorded in the Goryeosa Yaeji, or The Official History of Goryeo, mentioned as part of receiving a Chinese messenger to the court.Yoo, Yang-Seok The Book of Korean Tea (Seoul: The Myung Won Cultural Foundation, 2007) p.68 = Joseon dynasty = During the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910), the ritualistic drinking of tea continued and was further refined. \\"Tabang\\" sustained and organized main royal ceremony. The royal Yi family and the aristocracy used tea for simple rites, the \\"Day Tea Rite\\" was a common daytime ceremony, whereas the \\"Special Tea Rite\\" was reserved for specific occasions. They were codified in the 1474 \\"National Five Rites\\" (Gukjo Oryeui, ÂúãÊúù‰∫îÁ¶ÆÂÑÄ, Íµ≠Ï°∞Ïò§Î°ÄÏùò).Kang, Don-ku \\"Traditional Religions and Christianity in Korea\\" Korea Journal (Autumn, 1998) p.103 These terms are not found in other countries. But plantation problems changed many ways Korean tea was governed. Unlike tea plantation areas in China or Japan, the climate of the Korean Peninsula is much colder and Tea harvesting season occurs just before the spring. So at that period, the tea tree forested areas in the mountains were still so cold and also dangerous because of wildlife. The old Korean name of tea, ÏÑ§Î°ù(\\"Seollok\\", Èõ™Á∂†), means the first flush tea leaf was harvested on the snow field of a mountain. This situation brought much trouble during the Goryeo Dynasty and Joseon Dynasty. The tea tree forested area is also the traditional Breadbasket of Korea and the tea leaf harvesting season and cereal seeding season overlap each other. Because of its value, farmers who lived around tea tree forested regions paid a steep tea tax to the King. So harvesting and treating tea leaf is pointed out as the major cause of the decrease in annual tea crop harvest. In the Goryeo Dynasty, there were hundreds of appeals by many lieges and scholars as Lee Je-hyun or Lee Gyu-bo. And finally at the end of the Goryeo Dynasty, recorded in the \\"Yuduryurok(Ïú†ÎëêÎ•òÎ°ù, ÈÅäÈ†≠ÊµÅÈåÑ)\\", farmers burnt or chopped their tea trees to protest their tea tax. In the case of Joseon Dynasty, governed based by Confucianism, Tabang was sustained for tea ceremony but reduced the scale of tea production in order to protect the agricultural balance. Because of this reason, the development of the tea industry was prevented for a very long time. And except Yangban and the Royal family, Korean original tea drinking culture and ceremony remained in a limited area around tea tree forested regions.Hwang Yun-sook, \\"Beautiful tea of korea\\" (Seoul: Korean traditional food research, 2007) p.54 However, by the middle of the Joseon dynasty, there appears to have been a decline in tea drinking except for the ceremony for anniversary. It is said, that when the Ming Commander, Yang Hao, told King Seonjo (r.1567-1601) during the Japanese invasion that he had discovered high-quality tea plants in Korea, and that \\"if you were to sell the tea in Liaodong, you could get a silver coin for every ten pounds of tea. Altogether, that would be enough silver to buy ten thousand horses.\\" King Seonjo, however, replied \\"We do not have a tea drinking custom in our country.\\"Choi Ha-Rim \\"Tea Ceremony and Implements\\" Koreana (11)4 1997 pp.22-27 = Post-Joseon dynasty = Towards the end of the Joseon Dynasty, commoners joined the trend and used tea for ancestral rites. Mainly Scholars of Silhak, like Jeong Yak-yong, Kim Jeong- hui, had interests in tea \\"drinking\\" culture and its production at their exile period on tea forested region. These people corresponded with monks who still had tea drinking culture. It started from Silla and Goryeo Dynasty that monks formed and administrated tea forest around the temple and it passed down as their possession. And Buddhist tea ceremony and drinking culture stylized in the traditional temple. And these two cultural leader group's relationship influenced both Seonbi society and contemporary monks.Hwang Yun-sook, \\"Beautiful tea of Korea\\" (Seoul: Korean traditional food research, 2007) p.54 Equipment Pottery for tea Korean tea ceremonies follow the seasons, and the ceramics and metalware used vary. Religious traditions were influential. Stoneware was common, earthenware more frequent, mostly made in provincial kilns, with porcelain rare, imperial porcelain with dragons the rarest. Examples of equipment used in this ceremony are also discussed in the general entry Korean Ceramics as well as the more specific Korean pottery with images cited. Historically the appearance of the bowls and cups is naturalistic, with a division according to religious influence. Celadon or jade green, \\"punchong\\" (hangul:Î∂ÑÏ≤≠, hanja:Á≤âÈùë), or bronze-like weathered patinas for Buddhist tea rituals; the purest of white with faint designs in porcelain for Confucian tea rituals; and coarser porcelains and ash-stone glazes for animist tea rituals, or for export to Japan where they were known as \\"gohan chawan\\". An aesthetic of rough surface texture from a clay and sand mix with a thin glazing were particularly prized and copied. The randomness of this creation was said to provide a \\"now moment of reality\\" treasured by tea masters. Glazing has very rich texture and variations between many tones occur that change colour according to light and season. Clay used was generally light, with celadon clays being particularly prized. Glazing tricks could imitate most materials: from bamboo, through pebbles in rivers, through tree-bark, to human skin, with rare and unique glazes that gave tiger's eye, peach, or snow-like attributes in deep snow-drift glazes or fine etched white porcelain. Thus enhancing memories of seasons, poems, writings, or still moments. Potting style, glazing, form vary according to date. Old designs are still kept up, and exports to Japan were significant, from the late 16th century onwards. Korean potters such as the Yi Sukkwang (Ïù¥ÏàôÌô©) and Yi Kyeong (Ïù¥Í≤Ω), brothers transferred traditional styles abroad that became known as the \\"Hagi\\" styles. Individual families of potters and provincial kilns provided highly individual glazes whose depth identifies the best middle Joseon jagi (Joseon wares). Summer tea equipment consisted of \\"katade\\" bowls that were 5 cm tall and 12 cm wide. The dimensions exposed a maximum surface area to aid in cooling boiled water. Hot water would be poured into the bowls, allowed to cool a bit, then poured into a teapot. The water was cooled because pouring boiling hot water over tea leaves extracts too much of the bitter taste and results in a bitter tea. With two hands, the tea would be poured into smaller matching cups with covers, placed on a rough wood or lacquer table. The tea was drunk by lifting the cup cover while drinking so as not to show the open mouth. Tea would be taken cool. Autumn and winter tea equipment consisted of taller narrower bowls, such as the \\"irabo\\" style, that would contain and maintain heat. Typically of spiral construction, shallow, with a high rim. Once again tea made within that bowl would then be poured into heated teapots, and poured centered over a smaller matching cup with cover. Tea would be taken hot. And once again repeatedly poured in small spurts from cup to cup so as to prevent flavour concentrated in one cup. Unlike the Chinese tradition, no Korean tea vessels used in the ceremony are tested for a fine musical note. Judgment instead is based on naturalness in form, emotion, and colouring. A natural approach to tea A typical setting for a Korean tea ceremony disregarding a contemporary tiled rather than paper covered floor. Central to the Korean approach to tea is an easy and natural coherence, with fewer formal rituals, fewer absolutes, greater freedom for relaxation, and more creativity in enjoying a wider variety of teas, services, and conversation. This leads to a wider variance of teahouse design, tea garden entries and gardens, different use and styles of teawares, and regional variations in choice of tea, choice of cakes and biscuits and snacks, seasonal and temporal variations, and the acoustic and visual ambiance of Korean teahouses. Tea storage containers were often large - being made of clay coils, finished on potter's wheels, and 3/4 glazed from within the kiln itself as wood burned. Natural green ash glazes were typical. A wood scoop with a long handle often a split bamboo with a scoop end would be used to retrieve the tea. Generally the best local water is used to make the tea, and at times some of the best Korean teahouses had their own small springs. Water is brought to boil above a wood fire, poured into a teapot and brought immediately to service. Tea is poured initially by a tea hostess into warmed cups from a heated teapot at a distance above the first cup so as to create a controlled flow of tea with attractive bubbles. This is done to create good luck. Tea ceremonies have always been used for important occasions such as birthdays, anniversaries, remembrance of old friends, and increasingly a way to rediscovering the joys of Seon meditation. As Korean tea was often green tea, even small leaves were rare. One of the modern variations of the Korean tea ceremony involves a low tea table around which the guests and master sit. The tea master or host will sit on one side and will heat and pour and clean the tea ware as part of the whole ceremony from start to finish. The host or master will often keep all the tea ware on the tea table all year, and will cover it with a cloth while not using it. The collection is often made up of several different teapots, often with many different color & shape teacups. The ceremony begins with all the guests sitting around the table and as the water heats the host will begin the conversation, usually with informal or casual questions, such as asking about the guests' family. The host will start the official ceremony by first heating the pot, cups and decanting bowl with hot water, then after this is complete, will pour the tea leaves - usually green tea - into the pot. Then the host pours hot water onto the leaves and will then pour out the water very quickly, thereby rinsing the leaves of any dust and opening them up slightly. Then, the host will pour the hot water into the decanting bowl and allow it to cool to the correct temperature for the tea they are using. This depends on when the tea is picked; tea picked earlier in the season, such as the first buds picked in early April, will be steeped at lower temperature () than tea leaves picked in June (). Once the water is at the right temperature, the host will pour the water into the pot and steep it for anywhere from 20 seconds to two to three minutes, depending on the tea. After steeping is complete, the host pours the tea into the decanting bowl, which serves to get the water off the leaves in the pot and also to give the tea an even mixture. Then it is poured into the cups. The guests will wait until the host or master picks up their cup first, then will pick up theirs. This is repeated until they are finished, which sometimes can be several hours later. The whole ceremony is very relaxing and is a wonderful way to get to know someone or to ease into a business transaction. Kinds of tea The earliest kinds of tea used in tea ceremonies were heavily pressed cakes of black tea, the equivalent of aged pu-erh tea still popular in China. Vintages of tea were respected, and tea of great age imported from China had a certain popularity at court. However, importation of tea plants by Buddhist monks brought a more delicate series of teas into Korea, and the tea ceremony. While green tea, \\"chaksol\\" or \\"chugno\\", is most often served, other teas such as \\"Byeoksoryung\\" Chunhachoon, Woojeon, Jakseol, Jookro, Okcheon, as well as native chrysanthemum tea, persimmon leaf tea, or mugwort tea may be served at different times of the year. Korean teas were divided into the five different tastes: bitterness, sweetness, astringency, saltiness and \\"sourness\\". Aging is rare and most teas are consumed as fresh as possible, with particular note to new harvests. Tea regions were famous for producing teas with characteristic compositions of the five taste elements: Jeju Island, contemporarily, has teas with more salt in them due to ocean winds; other elements are brought out by different means of cooking the leaves, or hardness of water. Teas also evoke four kinds of thought for Korean Buddhists: peacefulness, respectfulness, purity and quietness. Those teas that bring out more of these qualities are prized. Kinds of Tea Ceremonies Buddhist monks incorporated tea ceremonies into votive offerings. However, the Goryeo nobility and later the Confucian yangban scholars formalized the rituals into things of beauty. There are at least 15 major tea ceremonies that are performed, and they include, they are listed according to age and fame: * Day Tea Rite - Joseon dynasty daily palace tea ceremony * Special Tea Rite - Joseon dynasty ceremony welcoming visiting foreigners, trade and tribute missions, and at royal weddings * Queen Tea Ceremony - a special tea ceremony shown upon occasion in royal Korean soap operas: only for women friends, family and servants of the Queen, but often including the Crown Prince. Matcha, or powdered green tea, has also enjoyed limited popularity in Korea. Tea leaves ground into very fine powder are traditionally associated with the Japanese Tea Ceremony, but in Korea this form of tea has regained a certain amount of regard, especially with Buddhists. Myeong-san cha, or meditation tea is a form of meditation in and of itself. It is said to have been popular among monks practicing meditation for many days without sleep. Matcha contains more nutritional value than even regular ip-cha, or leaf tea. All of the tea leaf is consumed and it contains higher amounts of vitamin C, tannins and polyphenols. With the advent of Christianity in Korea, this kind of meditation tea is viewed as Buddhist and is largely ignored by many, based solely on religious beliefs. True da-in, or tea people relish the physical and cerebral benefits of matcha. Traditional Tea Ceremonies and Modern Restorations The modern times represent the period of revival and restoration of the traditional Korean tea culture and tea ceremonies in Korea. Of many involved in various traditional cultural efforts, Myung Won, Kim Mi-Hee held the first ever Korean tea culture research and academic conference in 1979, and in the subsequent year of 1980, Myung Won held the first ever public presentation of the comprehensive procedures of traditional Korean tea ceremonies at the Sejong cultural center. The tea ceremonies of the royal court, Buddhist temple tea ceremonies, Guest Greeting tea ceremonies and Everyday tea ceremony were resorted and presented. These traditional Korean tea ceremonies are being carried on today by Myung Won's second daughter, Kim Eui-Jung, who is the proprietor of the Intangible Cultural Asset 27 of Seoul, the Royal Court Tea ceremony. With the recognition of healthful effects of tea and increasing awareness of traditional culture, there is an increasing awareness of Korean tea culture and practice of tea ceremonies and there are many interest groups in Korea today. Contemporary revival of Tea Ceremonies at Panyaro Institute The Panyaro Institute for the Promotion of the Way of Tea was founded to perpetuate the lifelong work of the celebrated Korean Tea Master, the Venerable Hyodang, who devoted sixty years of his life to a study of the teachings of the great Korean spiritual master Wonhyo and to the elaboration of methods of using tea in meditation. Hyodang contributed to the culture of tea in three major ways: First, he published the first Korean book consecrated to the Way of Tea, \\"The Korean Way of Tea\\", a work that continues to inspire readers interested in Korean tea culture. Second, he transmitted the particular method of making the green tea known as Panyaro. Third, he founded the first association of Koreans interested in the study of tea, the \\"Korean Association for the Way of Tea\\". Hyodang was also the first to give ordinary readers an awareness of the significance of the life of the Venerable Ch'o-ui, the early 19th century tea master, through a series of articles published in a popular newspaper. Just as Ch'o-ui led the revival of interest in tea in his time, so Hyodang led the modern revival. In 1981 Chae Won-hwa launched what became the Panyaro Institute for the Promotion of the Way of Tea, and by November 1995 she had established a formal graduation ceremony for those who had completed the full course of study. Such ceremonies are now held each year.

Originally built by Baekje, it was occupied in turn by each of the Three Kingdoms. It stands on Achasan Mountain, in Gwangjin-gu, Seoul, South Korea, at an altitude of 200 meters above sea level. It has a perimeter of roughly 1 kilometer and an area of about 3375 m¬≤. The first mention of this fortress in historical records comes from the Samguk Sagi's statement that King Chaekgye of Baekje ordered it to be fortified against an expected Goguryeo invasion. At that time, Achasanseong Fortress would have played a key role in the defense of the Baekje capital Hanseong from the north. In 475, Goguryeo overran this and the other defenses of Baekje, and King Gaero of Baekje was brought to Acha and executed. The fortress and the rest of the Han River valley were conquered by Silla in 553. The Goguryeo general Ondal later died here while trying to reclaim the fortress. Achasanseong Fortress was designated as a historic landmark in 1973, and has since become a common local tourist destination.

Biography Jones' birthplace was on a farm about one mile northwest of the town of Smyrna, Delaware. His father was a farmer of exemplary moral and religious character and his mother was of a family greatly respected. She died when he was an infant. His father soon followed her to the grave and at four years of age he was an orphan. It is not clear how he became a doctor. Educated in medicine and practicing as a doctor, he was later appointed as Clerk of the Delaware Supreme Court. He was married to Anna Matilda Sykes, daughter of James Sykes the 15th Governor of Delaware; she died before he joined the United States Navy. =Midshipman= Jones joined the United States Navy in 1799 at the age of 31, very old for the times, when a midshipman could be as young as 10. Some think he joined the Navy because of grief after the death of his wife. He spent 22 months as an acting midshipman. =Lieutenant= During the Quasi-War with France, he served under Commodore John Barry in the frigate and was commissioned a lieutenant 27 February 1801. Jones joined the crew of on 24 May 1803 as second lieutenant (2nd mate). On 31 October 1803, he was taken prisoner with the rest of Philadelphias crew by the Bey of Tripoli and held until liberated in June 1805. =Master Commandant= On April 20, 1810, Jones received promotion to master commandant, and on June 4, he took command of . In October 1812, Jones and Wasp sailed on an Atlantic cruise. On 13 October he captured the British 12-gun brig HMS Dolphin. Despite storm damage to his ship, he attacked a British convoy on 18 October and, following an intense battle, captured the Royal Navy sloop of war , in a battle that became quite famous. Both combatants were seriously damaged and he soon fell victim to the powerful ship of the line . Still, Jones was widely admired and when he returned to the United States after an exchange of prisoners, he received a gold medal from the United States Congress. =Captain= Jones was promoted to the rank of captain in March 1813 and given command of the frigate . He spent time in Decatur's squadron, which was bottled up at New London during 1814. Later, Captain Jones was sent to the Lake Ontario theater, where he commanded the frigate during the last year of the war. During the second and final Barbary War, in 1815, Jones again commanded Macedonian. Service as captain of the frigate followed in 1816‚Äì1818. =Commodore= Jones was Commodore of the United States' squadrons in the Mediterranean in 1821‚Äì1823 and in the Pacific in 1826‚Äì1829. He was a Navy Commissioner in Washington, DC, between those tours at sea and held important commands ashore at Baltimore and New York during the 1830s and 1840s. He received his final assignment, as commandant of the Philadelphia Naval Asylum in 1847. Commodore Jacob Jones held that position until his death. Death and legacy Jacob Jones Memorial in Wilmington and Brandywine Cemetery Jones died on August 3, 1850 and is interred at the Wilmington and Brandywine Cemetery in Wilmington, Delaware.

Barton (born May 7, 1952 New York City, NY), is an American chemist. She worked as a Professor of Chemistry at Hunter College (1980‚Äì82), and at Columbia University (1983‚Äì89) before joining the California Institute of Technology (1989-to present). In 1997 she became the Arthur and Marian Hanisch Memorial Professor of Chemistry and from 2009 to 2019, the Norman Davidson Leadership Chair of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at Caltech. She currently is the John G. Kirkwood and Arthur A. Noyes Professor of Chemistry. Barton studies the chemical and physical properties of DNA and their roles in biological activities. The primary focus of her research is transverse electron transport along double-stranded DNA, its implications in the biology of DNA damage and repair, and its potential for materials sciences applications such as targeted chemotherapeutic treatments for cancer. Among many other awards, Barton has received the 2011 National Medal of Science and the 2015 Priestley Medal. Early life and education Jacqueline Ann Kapelman was born on May 7, 1952, in New York City. Her father served in Assembly for nearly a decade before serving as a trial judge in the New York Supreme Court next two decades. Her father was one of the trial judges in the Son of Sam serial murder case. Jacqueline Kapelman attended Riverdale Country School for Girls in Riverdale, New York, where her math teacher, Mrs. Rosenberg, insisted that she be allowed to take calculus at the boys' school. Her interest in chemistry began at Barnard College, where she studied physical chemistry with Bernice Segal. She loved laboratory work and chemical transformations and found Segal an inspiration as a teacher. During her last year at Barnard she married first year medical student Donald J. Barton, receiving her B.A. from Barnard College as Jacqueline Kapelman Barton, summa cum laude, in 1974. She then studied inorganic chemistry at Columbia University under the supervision of Stephen J. Lippard. While at Columbia she began studying transition-metal complexes and their possible applications to chemotherapy. She earned a PhD in Inorganic Chemistry in 1979, addressing The structure and chemical reactivity of a blue platinum complex: the interaction of antitumor platinum drugs and metallointercalation reagent with nucleic acids. Alternate link via Columbia University. Career and research After earning her Ph.D. from Columbia in 1979, Barton held post- doctoral appointments at Bell Labs and Yale University, where she worked with Robert G. Shulman. She used nuclear magnetic resonance imaging technology to examine the metabolism of yeast cells. Barton became a Professor of Chemistry at Hunter College from 1980 to 1982, and began to develop her own laboratory, the Barton Research Group. While at Hunter, she studied the interactions of zinc ions with DNA, and later the interactions of ruthenium(II) and cobalt(III) complexes with DNA. This enabled her to roughly model complexes on a DNA helix and to begin studying the photophysical and photochemical properties related to enantiomers. In the 1980s, she moved to Columbia University where she taught from 1983 to 1989. She became a full professor in 1986 and was the first woman to receive tenure in the Chemistry department at Columbia. Her research focused on the use of organo-ruthenium complexes to examine the physical structure of DNA. With Nicholas Turro and Vijay Kumar she studied the interactions of ruthenium phenanthroline complexes and DNA and was able to design binding molecules targeted to specific DNA sequences. Photosensitive ruthenium complexes would glow brightly when they attached to the DNA double helix. When rhodium complexes were attached to the DNA, they would attract the electron causing the glow, and \\"turn off\\" the effect. During her time at Columbia, Barton obtained two patents for this method of analyzing DNA structure. In 1989, Barton moved to Caltech, where her research has focused on charge transport in DNA. By using specially-designed chiral metal complexes as probes of DNA she has been able to study how DNA is damaged and repaired. In DNA-based diagnostic tests, complexes are used to determine whether electrons can flow across the DNA. If an electron could not move along the DNA, the DNA would continue to glow, indicating that there was damage in the DNA genetic molecule. The research that Barton, Catherine J. Murphy, Megan N√∫√±ez and others have done at Caltech has supported the idea of fast long- range electron transfer over DNA, challenging accepted scientific views and causing considerable controversy. Based on years of studies, Barton and her group theorize that DNA operates like a wire, supporting a type of long-range signaling that enables repair proteins to detect and correct mistakes in DNA. This view of DNA is deeper and more dynamic than previous views of DNA as a static library. Understanding the mediation of electron-transfer chemistry by the DNA double helix has laid a foundation for the development of new diagnostic tools and for the possible design of novel chemotherapeutics. Barton, Erik Holmlin, Shana Kelley, and Mike Hill created the company GeneOhm Sciences to explore the development of sensitive diagnostics for detecting DNA mismatches. The company has since been acquired by BD Diagnostics. Barton has taught more than 100 graduate and postdoctoral students, many of whom are women. Recognized as a \\"superb role model, not just for young women but for all young scientists\\", Barton advises others that \\"the best thing that I can do for women in science is first to do good science\\". She became the Arthur and Marian Hanisch Memorial Professor of Chemistry in 1997. She was named chair of the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering of California Institute of Technology, effective July 1, 2009. Barton has been a Member of the Board of Dow Chemical since 1993. She has also served on the Gilead Sciences Scientific Advisory Board (1989‚Äì2008) and recently became a member of Gilead's Board of Directors In 1990, she married Peter Dervan, a fellow chemist and professor at Caltech, who is also a National Medal of Science winner. She has two children, a daughter, Elizabeth (born in 1991), and a stepson Andrew. =Research summary= Barton (third right) receiving the National Medal of Science at the White House in 2011 Barton introduced the application of transition metal complexes to probe recognition and reactions of double helical DNA. She has designed chiral metal complexes which mimic the properties of DNA-binding proteins, allowing other researchers the capability to simulate and analyze experiments in this nature. Barton additionally established that DNA charge transport chemistry is extremely sensitive to intervening perturbations in the DNA base stack, as with single base mismatches or lesions. This discovery has been a cornerstone for the development of DNA-based electrochemical sensors. Awards and honors Barton was awarded the National Medal of Science by Barack Obama in 2011, \\"For discovery of a new property of the DNA helix, long-range electron transfer, and for showing that electron transfer depends upon stacking of the base pairs and DNA dynamics. Her experiments reveal a strategy for how DNA repair proteins locate DNA lesions and demonstrate a biological role for DNA-mediated charge transfer.\\" Other awards include: * Alan T.

He has spent about half his life in Spain, which has led to the distribution of his more central continental style within Iberia. The book Sokolov by the renowned Basque poet and critic Marrod√°n is to be found at the libraries of the many Spanish Universities and Royal Academies of Fine Art. The sculptor studied and lived in the studios of Miklos Dallos at his outset in Paris in the mid-1970s. Sokolov was seen by Marrod√°n as emanating from the French School of sculpture and there is a chain of teaching influence through Miklos Dallos and Marcel Gimond back to Antoine Bourdelle and Aristide Maillol. Sokolov, who in French manner elicits response within the bare subject of the torso and the nude, as does Dallos, also has, like Gimond, a strength for portraiture. That specification of sculpture as tension of force between the under-lying helicoidal axis and superposed rhythm of planes in Sokolov is tempered by the artist's choice to work, free from preparatory modelling, in direct-carving. The modernism of the French school of Sculpture developed in modelling but Sokolov's direct-carving is informed by the revolutionary carving influences of Br√¢ncu»ôi and the later Henry Moore. As a portraitist, Sokolov is unusual as working by taille directe, but the helicoidal axis teaching shapes the majority of his large body of work in the human figure and nude. Such movement about the axis would be a continuation of the Italian Art termed Mannerist. Alexander Sokolov, who has worked between studios in Ireland and Olula del Rio in Spain, has exhibited seventeen one man shows in European cities.

Possessing a wide-ranged voice, Rose would regularly meet in Kingston with singers, musicians, writers, and producers such as Dennis Brown, Big Youth, The Wailers, Gregory Isaacs, Sly and Robbie, and others. Career Rose started his recording career as a solo artist for record producers Yabby You and Niney the Observer. He joined Black Uhuru in 1977 after the departure of Don Carlos and Garth Dennis. He led them to international success in the early 1980s, having written most of their popular material. They won the first-ever Grammy Award for reggae in 1985 for the album Anthem, with the hallmark voice of Rose in the forefront. After the release of Anthem, Rose left Black Uhuru and retired to the Blue Mountains in Jamaica to start a coffee farm. He released a string of singles in Jamaica, but nothing much was heard of him outside the island until 1989, when he was signed to RCA and released the strongly pop influenced album Proud in Europe and Japan. The deal with RCA was short-lived however, and Rose returned to Jamaica to record a new string of Sly and Robbie produced singles. He also recorded for other producers but the only albums during this period were the Japan only releases Bonanza (1991) and King Of General (1992). The Sly and Robbie produced singles were eventually released on the vinyl only Sly And Robbie presents: Mykall Rose ‚Äì The Taxi Sessions in 1995 also saw his American debut as a solo artist with the album Michael Rose on Heartbeat Records. The single \\"Short Temper\\" reached No. 2 on the Gavin reggae chart. In the period 1995‚Äì2004 Heartbeat Records released a total of nine albums including Party in Session: Live and a compilation entitled Happiness: The Best Of Michael Rose. Next to these albums, a great amount of different recordings appeared on dozens of Jamaican vinyl singles and several albums, including \\"Last Chance\\" which was No. 1 on the UK reggae charts for several weeks. He also recorded \\"Michael Rows the Boat Ashore\\" in 2001. In 2002, Rose recorded two albums: Babylon 9/11 Tip Of The Iceberg (released on Love Injection in 2004), and a yet untitled album for African Star records. In August 2002, Rose was reported arrested in Miami Airport by U.S. Marshals in a case of mistaken identity. Although he was released, it resulted in Rose losing his U.S. work permit. Rose re-joined Black Uhuru in February 2004, and performed several concerts in Jamaica and Europe with the group. They also released a Jamaican single \\"Dollars\\" and reportedly have recorded a yet untitled and unreleased album. Yet, in spite of his reunion with Black Uhuru, Rose still tours, records and releases material as a solo artist. In 2007 he recorded the number 1 single \\"Shoot Out\\" for producer John John. His latest album was released early 2008 on the Rhythm Club record label, entitled Great Expectations.

A spinoff called Lady Stalker: Challenge from the Past was released in Japan for the SNES in 1995. The Sega Saturn game Dark Savior (produced by the same company) is considered its spiritual successor. The main characters from Landstalker, Nigel (Ryle in Japan and France, Niels in Germany) and Friday, reappear in the Dreamcast game Time Stalkers. It has been re-released several times: on the Wii's Virtual Console in 2007, Steam in 2011, and on the Sega Genesis Mini in 2019. A remake for the PlayStation Portable was announced in 2005, but was later cancelled. Gameplay The player, as Nigel the treasure hunter, is tasked with searching for clues that lead to the treasure of King Nole. This is accomplished primarily by travelling through both outdoor areas and dungeons. All gameplay and plot-advancing scenes take place in an isometric view. From the outset of the game, Nigel may walk, jump, swing his sword, climb ropes and ladders, talk to various non-player characters, and pick up and throw various objects. With very few exceptions, these basic actions do not change throughout the game, although Nigel's weapons and armor may be replaced with better versions. There are a variety of items throughout the game, most of which either increase or restore health and attacking power or are important to advancing the plot or solving puzzles. Much of the game's dungeons and overworld are filled with monsters, mostly creatures from fantasy and mythology like ogres, skeletons, ghosts, golems, and more; many may be avoided or killed for gold or other collectables, while others must be killed to advance the plot and the game. Many traps and puzzles also appear requiring the player to jump from platform to platform press switches and move blocks to climb on. Locked doors inhibit the player's progress, the player must find keys or beat enemies or puzzles to unlock them and progress further. Many dungeons and areas have a boss to defeat at the end. The monsters, puzzles and dungeons increase in difficulty as the game progresses. The player has health which is kept track of by hearts; health and the maximum health limit may be increased with items purchased in towns or found in dungeons. The player is not prevented from revisiting old towns and dungeons, and is frequently required to do so to advance the plot. There are several optional side quests found in the game involving helping out the non-player characters. Nigel can complete these tasks for benefits, like increased attacking power and use of shortcut warps to travel across the overworld quicker. These can help the player but are not necessary to complete the game. Plot The game's intro starts in Gamul Date 312 where Nigel, a treasure hunter who is 88 years old, far older than he appears, is shown traversing a dungeon of rolling boulders and moving platforms called Jypta Ruins to acquire the Statue of Jypta. After selling this statue to a shop owner in a port town, Nigel is accosted by a wood nymph named Friday. She explains that she is being chased by three persistent yet bumbling thieves named Kayla, Ink, and Wally because she knows the location of the legendary treasure of King Nole. Once Nigel spends most of his money on a bird to carry him to the island, Friday admits that while she doesn't know the exact location of the treasure she has a \\"feeling\\" where it is. The player controls Nigel from here on where he and Friday, who accompanies him for the entire game, first journey through a dungeon until they fall into a river and end up in the care of the red-furred bear-people of Massan. When Nigel awakes, he finds his way to the neighboring village of Gumi, where the yellow-furred bear-people are ready to sacrifice the daughter of Massan's leader, Fara. Nigel follows the crazed tribe into their shrine and breaks them of their curse, freeing Fara and earning the respect of both tribes and a clue to help him to the treasure. Nigel and Friday travel westward until they come to the lighthouse town of Ryuma which has been attacked by thieves. Nigel goes to the thieves' cave and rescues the mayor and some other men who have been kidnapped. He also finds a lithograph of a dragon, which Friday tells him is a clue to the treasure. Before he can leave, Kayla, Ink, and Wally show up and hold Friday hostage until Nigel hands them the lithograph. Nigel's heroics earn him a place in the court of Duke Mercator, who orders him to go and defeat an old wizard, Mir, who is locked in a tower nearby and who has been terrorizing the town and extorting the Duke. Nigel braves a crypt and the wizard's tower and faces him in single combat. Defeated, Mir confesses all he knows about King Nole's treasure and then explains that the Duke is his brother and had been using him as a scapegoat for years. Nigel returns to the Duke and is about ready to confront him when he is tossed into a dungeon. While imprisoned he finds out that the princess of Maple, his home country, who had been a guest at the castle, has been taken away by the Duke's dragon-like henchman, Zak. He manages to escape to find the castle knights in open revolt and ships stuck in the harbour because the lighthouse in Ryuma is broken. Nigel saves Arthur, the Duke's general, and is given the key to the Greenmaze, where the Sunstone can be found, the gem that powers Ryuma's lighthouse. Nigel navigates the maze despite the best efforts of troublesome gnomes and restores the lighthouse. He then takes a ship to pursue the Duke. He makes landing up the coast of the island at Verla, which has practically become a ghost town. The Duke had enslaved the population of the town and forced them to work in nearby mines searching for a legendary treasure. Nigel frees the townspeople, and they give him a legendary sword they found but had hidden from the Duke. Nigel continues through the mine to find the Duke sailing, via rafts, across a lake to an island temple. Nigel finds a way over and navigates through the labyrinth to fight the Duke but is caught off-guard by Zak. Nigel is teleported to safety by Mir before the Duke and Zak can finish him off. Mir then proceeds to give Nigel some more information about King Nole's treasure. Mir also gives a magical axe to Nigel which allows him to cut down trees with a single swing of his sword. Nigel retakes his sword in hand, and Friday leads him up through mountains to get to the entrance to the underground dungeon where King Nole hid his treasure. They encounter Zak again, who has decided that while he doesn't like working for the Duke any longer he still wants to face Nigel one on one. After Nigel proves his superiority, Zak gives Nigel something he stole from the Duke that will allow Nigel to enter the underground. Zak departs defeated. Nigel finds himself back at the same cave he started in, this time filled with monsters but no traps. He gets to the Duke just as he uses the Princess to open the gate between the above and below worlds (referencing the song In-A-Gadda-Da- Vida). Nigel charges through into the center of the island and into King Nole's labyrinth, a massive confusing dungeon guarding King Nole's palace. After making it through the labyrinth and the palace, Nigel makes it to the room which held the treasure. After all the challenges so far, things are not quite finished for King Nole's restless Spirit attacks Nigel but Nigel makes quick work of him. The Duke then shows up and as he thanks Nigel for doing the dirty work for him, Gola, the Dragon God that King Nole worshipped, burns him alive. Nigel fights Gola using all of his strength and cunning, and when the beast is finally vanquished, the treasure is his. With vast sums of gold under his control he decides that rather than retire he and Friday will continue their adventures. In the original ending in the Japanese and European version the treasure vanishes after Gola's last stand. Nigel isn't very upset and suggests taking Friday with him to the main country for new adventures. Localization changes *In one scene, Kayla is taking a bath. Nigel can either join or try to leave her, but in the end he will be beaten by Friday or Kayla's Henchmen. In the North American and European versions, script and dialogues for this scene are present and translated in cartridge's data but a maid was added in front of a door, so that Ryle/Nigel can't get into the room where this scene happens. *‚ÄúMadam Yards Pink Palace‚Äù (brothel) was renamed ‚ÄúBallet Studio‚Äù for North America and Europe. *The ending differs slightly between the American version and the European/Japanese version. *Items with erotic references in the original Japanese version were changed in the American and European versions: **Oracle Stone is a bunny playmate called \\"Bunny-chan\\" in the Japanese version. **Spellbook is an erotic book in the Japanese version. **Shortcake is a bunny playmate costume (Usagi no fuku) in the Japanese version. **Pawn Ticket is a G-String in the Japanese version. *In the crypt, the sign reading \\"WHOUDINI\\" (NA/EUR versions) reads \\"KAN NAITO\\" (Landstalker's chief programmer and executive producer) in the original Japanese version. *Some characters' names differ between versions: **Ryle (JP, FR) ‚Äì Nigel (NA, EUR) ‚Äì Niels (DE) **Kayla Kowalski (NA, EUR) ‚Äì Kala Kowalski (JP) **Wally & Ink (NA, EU) ‚Äì Goose & Zwam (JP) **Princess Lara (NA, EUR) ‚Äì Princess Rolia (JP) **Zak (NA, EUR) ‚Äì Zed Saw(JP) **Arthur (NA, EUR) ‚Äì Don mel (JP) **Pocket (NA, EUR) ‚Äì Morio Reception The game was reviewed in 1995 in Dragon #217 by Jay & Dee in the \\"Eye of the Monitor\\" column. Jay gave the game 3 out of 5 stars, while Dee gave the game 4 out of 5 stars. The game was praised in the Australian-based Megazone magazine, where it received a 9 out of 10. The game received extremely positive attention in GameFan magazine, getting reviewed twice, once for the import version, then again for the American release. The import review gave it a perfect 10 out of 10, stating that it was \\"the perfect action/RPG\\" and that if \\"this was an American release, I would give it game of the year, it's that good.\\" According to Next Generation, Landstalker met with critical acclaim in Japan, and was a major system seller for the Mega Drive there.

It uses a Wild West setting. It follows retired U.S. Marshal James Anderson, who seeks to bring justice to a gang of criminals who killed his wife and kidnapped his daughter. It uses an enhanced version of the Jedi game engine, first seen in Star Wars: Dark Forces. It is also largely credited as the first shooter game with a sniper zoom, as well as one of the first to feature a gun reloading mechanic. LucasArts' INSANE animation engine was used to render computer graphics animation sequences. These have special filters to look hand-drawn, and play between each mission and set up the action in the next area. The game received generally favorable reviews from critics. While the graphics were often the topic of scrutiny and comparison to better looking titles of the time, such as Quake, reviewers were largely unanimous in praising the game's orchestral soundtrack, composed by Clint Bajakian, and solid gameplay. The voice cast includes veteran talent such as John de Lancie, Richard Moll and Jack Angel. A free expansion, entitled Handful of Missions, was released in 1998. Community-created expansion levels are also available and have received media coverage. Although not a huge financial success, the game has a cult following. Gameplay Outlaws features one of the earliest examples of a sniper zoom system. Unlike many modern shooters, which switch to a full screen zoom, here only the scope itself is affected by the zoom. Outlaws is a first- person shooter. Players control the character as he utilizes several American Old West weapons and items, such as a rifle, shotgun, dynamite and revolver. The player can activate the lantern inventory item to lighten dark areas, and use a shovel in specific areas to dig holes. In the lower difficulty levels, termed Good and Bad, the player is able to sustain several bullet wounds with no apparent ill effects. In the hardest difficulty level, Ugly, the player's resistance is reduced to one or two shots. This forces the player into a different style of play. Where on the easier difficulty levels a player might charge into a gunfight heedless of Anderson's personal health, in Ugly mode, the player must use stealth and cover to win.\\"The New Sheriff in Town\\". Ryan, Michael E. PC Magazine. July 1997 Aside from the main single player campaign, Outlaws includes a set of five discrete missions that chronicle Anderson's rise to the rank of U.S. Marshal. Each of the missions requires Anderson to either capture or kill a specific outlaw. Ranks (Deputy, Sheriff, and Marshal) are awarded on the accumulation of a set number of points. Points are awarded for recovering stolen gold, capturing/killing the outlaw, and for killing enemies. Each outlaw that the player captures or kills appears in a jail cell in Anderson's field office. More points are awarded for capturing an outlaw than for killing one, due to the difficulty in capturing one alive. Completion of the Historical Missions is not a requirement for playing the single player campaign. Outlaws also features a multiplayer deathmatch in for variants, including a Kill the Fool with the Chicken mode. Multiplayer can be played over local area network, and it was one of the featured games on the MSN Gaming Zone before its demise. The player can assume the role of one of six characters from the main game: Matt \\"Dr. Death\\" Jackson, \\"Bloody\\" Mary Nash, James Anderson, Chief Two-Feathers, \\"Gentleman\\" Bob Graham, and \\"Spittin'\\" Jack Sanchez. Each character has its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of speed/maneuverability, weapons selection, and resistance. Plot James Anderson, a retired U.S. Marshal, comes home after a trip to the general store to find his wife Anna dying and that his daughter Sarah has been kidnapped by two outlaws known as Matt \\"Dr. Death\\" Jackson and \\"Slim\\" Sam Fulton, under the employ of the railroad baron Bob Graham. Graham has hired several wanted outlaws to \\"enlighten\\" the people of the county to sell their land to him, so that he can make money on a huge railway. However, the psychotic Dr. Death misinterprets Graham's meaning of enlightenment, attacks Anna and leaves her for dead, kidnaps Anderson's daughter, and burns his home to the ground. After burying his wife, the retired Marshal picks up his gun once again and rides off to find his daughter. He travels around the old West, shooting his way through each member of Graham's hired outlaws. On his journey Anderson is haunted by dreams of his father's murder as a child. He recalls that while the two were camping out in the wild, an unknown assailant shot his father in his sleep, but left young James alive, telling him \\"to keep that fear [of death], kid\\". After questioning more and more outlaws, Anderson is confronted by Dr. Death in an old mine. Anderson eventually gets the drop on him; he gets tangled up in a rope above a deep mine shaft. Dr. Death tells him that his daughter is hidden in an old Indian cliff village. After finding out that Anderson is not going to let him out of the pit, he teases Anderson about the murder of his wife. Anderson is enraged and puts his cigar in the pulley from which the rope is hanging, eventually burning up the rope and sending Dr. Death plummeting to his demise at the bottom of the shaft. At the Indian village, Anderson is ambushed by renegade Indian Two Feathers. After defeating him, Two Feathers praises Anderson's strength in battle, and out of sympathy because he once had a child he had lost, tells him the real location of Sarah: Bob Graham's estate, Big Rock ranch. Anderson blasts his way into Graham's villa, and finally confronts him. After a fierce gunfight, Graham is believed dead and falls to the ground, and Anderson reunites with his daughter. Graham, clinging to life and gun trained on Anderson, reveals that he was the one who murdered Anderson's father. Just as Graham is about to finish off Anderson, Sarah manages to shoot Graham with Anderson's gun avenging her grandfather's death. After a tearful reunion, father and daughter ride into the sunset. Development Outlaws is powered by an upgraded version of the Jedi engine, which was previously used on Star Wars: Dark Forces. LucasArts' INSANE animation engine is used to display the game's cutscenes. The game was also originally planned to have 12 unique multiplayer characters, each with their own in-game attributes. The final release halved that number to six characters. The game was inspired by western films such as The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and A Fistful of Dollars, as well as other Clint Eastwood westerns. It was released for Microsoft Windows on April 7, 1997. It is the first video game to feature a sniper zoom, and one of the earliest examples of a reloading mechanic. Despite the serious tone of the game, Outlaws maintained a few easter egg jokes, including Max of the Sam & Max series, hidden inside a building, a pair of grey aliens experimenting on a cow, and several references to the Indiana Jones series of games and movies. In 1997, LucasArts released a patch to update the game to version 1.1 to add Glide and Aureal A3D, and another one to add Direct3D compatibility to the game in 2001, complementing the existing software rendering support. Shortly after the initial release, a small official expansion pack called Handful of Missions was released for free. It added four single player missions as well as multiplayer maps and updated the game to version 2.0. Outlaws is listed as one of noted game designer John Romero's all-time favorite games. On March 19, 2015, Disney Interactive re-released the game for Digital distribution on GOG.com. In contrast, the community created XL Engine allows players to use their original CD to play through the game in a modern setting. In 1998, LucasArts released a set of four single player missions, called Handful of Missions, for download from the official website. The package includes several new multiplayer missions, and a patch to update the game to version 2.0. The single player missions take place outside of the original game's story, and each level is unrelated to the next. Third party levels have been created by the game's community. On April 5, 2013 GameSpot and several other media outlets organized a playthrough of several LucasArts games to honor the then recently closed developer. GameSpot staff noted that the \\"community for [Outlaws] has created like 75 user generated maps.\\" In reality more than 1,500 custom multiplayer maps have been created since Outlaws was released, and maps continued to be released until late 2012. Music for the game was scored by composer Clint Bajakian. An orchestra was used with authentic instruments which was uncommon at that time. In total, Mixed Mode CD contains fifteen different audio tracks which were suitable for playback on a regular CD player. It is noteworthy that the crystal case of the game's original release had a tracklist printed on its back side as it is the case with most normal audio CDs. Several veteran actors lend their voices to the game. John de Lancie portrays Matt Jackson, Richard Moll of Night Court plays Bob Graham. Veteran voice actor Jack Angel portrays two characters, George Bowers and Jack Sanchez. Jeff Osterhage, himself a veteran of western television films, voices the game's protagonist, U.S. Marshal James Anderson. Reception Outlaws received mostly positive reviews from critics. It has been featured in multiple Best Of lists since its release. Complex.com writer Gus Turner included it in his list of The 25 Best LucasArts Games. Of its legacy Turner said it was not a \\"major financial success, the title has only been able to attract a cult following since its release.\\" Brittany Vincent of ShackNews placed it on her list of Five LucasArts Classics Ripe for Remakes, and noted that it \\"deserves another chance to woo gamers.\\" Next Generation stated that \\"Outlaws uses the Dark Forces engine, and it shows. The graphics are a bit outdated, a bit disorienting, and more than a bit pixelated in close. The game's saving grace is its plot, admittedly and oft-overlooked aspect of this genre.\\" GameSpot reviewer Chris Hudak commended the game's story and cinematic cutscenes, calling it a \\"movie-worthy experience\\" and citing the cinematic and musical influences of Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns and Ennio Morricone's scores, respectively; he overall praised the game and called it \\"the most complete and faithful Old West shooter in the industry to date\\". In a retrospective review of the game, Kotaku editor Luke Plunkett praised the game's soundtrack and called the multiplayer \\"excellent.\\" Plunkett cited the release of the visually superior Quake a year earlier and Half-Life not long after as factors that led to the game fading into obscurity for most players. The Escapist's Stew Shearer gave high marks for the game's villains; he called them \\"fun to hate.\\" He stated that Outlaws \\"isn't just Doom with cowboys; you can tell that the developers put some real hard work into making the player feel like they're the hero in a Sergio Leone flick.\\" The reviewer for Computer Games Magazine noted that while the game did not look as visually appealing as its competitors, other developers should \\"show as much thought in level and multiplayer design.\\" Some reviewers were more critical of the game. The reviewer for Computer Gaming World said that \\"There's nothing really wrong with Outlaws. There just isn't much right with it.\\" The reviewer noted that the game had excellent music and art, but felt that the game had nothing new or innovative to offer players. Edge magazine's reviewer stated that \\"not for the first time, shown that it's not infallible.\\" Charlie Brooker of PC Zone (UK) had to take time to warm up to the game. \\"when you start playing Outlaws, it feels downright cruddy.\\" Brooker stated that after a lengthy amount of play his opinion changed, and ultimately he gave the game a favorable review. Computer Gaming World gave the soundtrack for Outlaws its 1997 \\"Musical Achievement\\" award. Outlaws was a finalist for the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences 1997 \\"Outstanding Achievement in Sound and Music\\" award, which ultimately went to PaRappa the Rapper. In 2008 IGN selected the soundtrack from Outlaws to its \\"10 Great Videogame Albums\\" list.

The park protects important tracts of forest and savannah, and is considered a conservation priority for West Africa as a whole. History Areas of low human impact are comparatively rare now in Guinea, and found only in areas of low population density. One such area is that of the Mafou Forest, the last remaining area of dry forest in Guinea and one of the few left in West Africa. This area has a low population because of the widespread incidences of river-blindness and as a result of the atrocities of Samory Tour√© in the latter part of the 19th century. The area has been little disturbed in the last 50 years. The park comprises two zones, a core protected zone and a buffer zone in which local people are encouraged to use the resources of the part in a sustainable way. Farming and the collecting of non-timber forest products is permitted. The government manages fishing, hunting and timber harvesting in cooperation with local communities. Since 2005, the protected area is considered a Lion Conservation Unit. Ecology of the park The park covers several ecological zones, the dominant is that of savannah, consisting of woodland and bushland. A smaller area of the park consists of riparian forests along the Niger and Mafou Rivers. Around five percent of the park is agricultural, along the edges of the park. The park is subject to frequent fires during the dry season. Fauna of the park Surveys in the park conducted during 1996‚Äì97 revealed a diverse mammalian fauna of 94 species including: *24 rodents *18 bats: Franquet's epauletted fruit bat (Epomops franqueti), horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus alcyone) *17 carnivores: Caracal (Caracal caracal), Egyptian mongoose (Herpestes ichneumon), Gambian mongoose (Mungos gambianus), spot- necked otter (Lutra maculicollis) *14 ungulates: giant forest hog (Hylochoerus meinertzhageni), kob (Kobus kob), waterbuck (K. ellipsiprymnus) *nine insectivores: four-toed hedgehog (Atelerix albiventris), climbing shrew (Suncus megalura) *seven primates: chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), Senegal galago (Galago senegalensis) *giant pangolin (Manis gigantea) and tree pangolin (M. tricuspis), and *African savanna hare (Lepus victoriae). The African elephant (Loxodonta africana) once occurred in the park but is now extinct. African manatee (Trichechus senegalensis) has been recorded. In 1997, lion (Panthera leo) returned to the protected area, probably migrating from the Tinkisso River region. Threats to the park There is a large trade in hunted animals from the park. At present this is carefully managed by park authorities, who feel that creating incentives for careful management of the resources is the best way to protect the forest as a whole. This is in line with current trends in community conservation.

Boothe achieved an international reputation as one of Jamaica's finest vocalists through a series of crossover hits that appealed to both reggae fans and mainstream audiences. Biography Ken Boothe was born in Denham Town, Kingston. He attended Denham Primary Elementary School and during this period developed an interest in music after receiving encouragement from his eldest sister, Hyacinth Clover, who was an established vocalist.Ken Boothe Biography at Trojan Records Author: Laurence Cane-Honeysett. Retrieved 1 June 2013.Ken Boothe Interview at Reggaeville Interviewer: Angus Taylor. Published: 22 March 2013. Retrieved 1 June 2013. Boothe cites singer Owen Gray as a major influence, particularly after hearing Gray perform the Leiber and Stoller rhythm and blues version of the 1920s blues standard, \\"Kansas City Blues\\", written by E L Bowman and notably performed by Jim Jackson in 1927. Stranger Cole, who was an established artist and neighbor to Boothe, had already worked with Boothe on the Sir Percy sound system as well as recording two songs for independent producer Sir Mike though Boothe's major breakthrough came in 1963 after Cole arranged an audition at Duke Reid's studio. The audition with Cole and Boothe performing the song \\"Uno Dos Tres\\" was a success and Boothe and Cole formed the duo 'Stranger & Ken' with the first track released by them being \\"Hush Baby\\" on the B-side of Cole's Island Records single \\"Last Love\\". This was followed by the singles \\"Thick in Love\\" both released in 1963 on R&B; Records.Thompson, Dave (2002), Reggae & Caribbean Music, Backbeat Books, , pp. 336, 368. They released several more popular singles between 1963 and 1965, including \\"World's Fair\\", \\"Hush\\", and \\"Artibella\\". Boothe also recorded as a duo with Roy Shirley (as Roy & Ken), which resulted in the release of the single \\"Paradise\\" in 1966. Boothe's first solo tracks were recorded in 1966 after Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd had signed him to his Studio One Label. He also recorded material for Phil Pratt and Sonia Pottinger the same year. He had almost immediate success with songs including \\"The Train Is Coming\\" (on which he was backed by the Wailers), the first, ska version, of later reggae song You're No Good with Soulettes (the group Bob Marley's future wife Rita Anderson was in) on B-side, and \\"Lonely Teardrops\\". The following year, Boothe and Alton Ellis had a successful UK tour with the Studio One session group, the Soul Vendors. Boothe was promoted as \\"Mr. Rock Steady\\" by Dodd during this period. The rocksteady classic \\"Moving Away\\" was released in 1967 or 1968 on the Coxsone label. \\"Moving Away\\" is a song still popular today, and covered or sampled by many artists, among them Dennis Brown, Jackie Mittoo (\\"Macka Fat\\"), Jack Radics I-Roy, U-Roy (\\"African Message\\"), Janet Key, Jaime Hinckson, Romain des Bois, Bruno Mars, Al Campbell (\\"Dress Black\\" Garnett Silk (\\"It's Growing\\"), Half Pint (\\"Substitute Lover\\"), Wayne Wonder (\\"Time To Say Good Bye\\"), Leroy Smart (\\"Talk About Friends\\"), Sanchez (\\"Don't Worry\\"), Admiral Tibet (\\"Nuthin Nah Run\\" among many others. Many of Boothe's songs have been reused in one way or another. On the B-side of the single \\"Moving Away\\" was the instrumental \\"Streets Of Gold\\" by the Skatalites. Boothe continued to record for Dodd until 1970, when he switched to producer Leslie Kong's Beverley's Records and reggae, where his success continued with hits such as \\"Freedom Street\\" and \\"Why Baby Why\\".Larkin, Colin (1998) The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae, Virgin Books, , p. 34. After Kong died, Boothe recorded for many of Jamaica's top producers during the early 1970s, including Keith Hudson, Herman Chin Loy, Vincent \\"Randy\\" Chin, and Phil Pratt. He then formed the group Conscious Minds with B. B. Seaton. Under a new direction from record producer Lloyd Charmers, Boothe released \\"Everything I Own\\" on Trojan Records, which reached Number One in the UK Singles Chart in 1974. The song, written by David Gates, was given a sympathetic light reggae feel and it received airplay and an appreciative audience in the West Indies and was regularly played on the radio stations of the UK due to its \\"crossover\\" appeal. David Gates' own group, Bread, had had a minor UK hit with the song in the spring of 1972, but it had only reached No. 32. Boothe's reggae version of the song \\"Everything I Own\\" reached Number One in the UK Singles Chart on 26 October 1974, and stayed at the top of the charts for three weeks. It featured Lloyd Parks on bass guitar, Paul Douglas a.k.a. Paul Williams on drums, Willie Lindo on guitar, and Lloyd Charmers on organ, piano and percussion. The recording was produced by Lloyd Charmers. Boothe had one more hit in the UK Singles Chart during the 1970s, \\"Crying Over You\\", which made No. 11, with Trojan Records' collapse and a split with Charmers losing much of the momentum built up by his two hits. Boothe recorded a reggae version of the standard \\"When I Fall In Love\\" which was released in 1974 on the Studio One label. In 1978, along with Dillinger, Leroy Smart, and Delroy Wilson, Boothe was referenced by lyricist Joe Strummer in the Clash's song, \\"(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais\\". Boothe reunited with Charmers in the late 1970s when a revived Trojan Records released the albums Blood Brothers (first issued on LTD in 1976) and Who Gets Your Love, but the reunion proved to be short-lived. He continued to record during the 1980s and had a few hits during 1986 and 1987.

Its basin is composed of shallow freshwater lakes and marshes surrounded by areas of dense vegetation. It forms the center of the island's most important rice-growing region. It is a rich habitat for wildlife, including some rare and endangered species, as well as an important fishing ground. Lake Alaotra and its surrounding wetlands cover , and include a range of habitats, including open water, reedbeds, marshes, and rice paddies. The lake itself covers . Lake Alaotra was declared a wetland of international importance under the international Ramsar Convention on February 2, 2003. The longfin tilapia (Oreochromis macrochir) was introduced into Lake Alaotra from the mainland in 1954 and proliferated quickly. By 1957, it provided 46% of the catch, perhaps because it was moving into an empty ecological niche as a phytophagous species. The fertile plain surrounding Lake Alaotra is Madagascar's most important rice-producing region. The hills surrounding the lake were formerly forested but have mostly been cleared for farmland in past decades. Severe erosion on these vulnerable hill slopes has caused considerable sedimentation of the lake, which is fast disappearing; the lake is now only deep during the dry season. Pressure to create more rice fields has also led locals to burn the reedbeds surrounding the lake. These reedbeds provide the sole habitat of the endemic Alaotra gentle lemur (Hapalemur griseus alaotrensis). The Alaotra gentle lemur is now limited to only of remaining reedbeds, and in recent years, its population rapidly declined by 60%, from about 7,500 individuals in 1994 to 3,000 in 2001, mostly from habitat loss, but also from hunting by local villagers. The lake is also an important but increasingly threatened habitat for waterbirds, including the endangered Meller's duck (Anas melleri). Two waterbird species were endemic to northern Madagascar, the Madagascar pochard (Aythya innotata) and the Alaotra grebe (Tachybaptus rufolavatus). The Madagascar pochard is now critically endangered and no longer found on the lake, although very small numbers exist elsewhere. The Alaotra grebe was declared extinct in 2010. The area of the lake may have been its only habitat.Lake Alaotra at BirdLife International The Ambato River provides the lake with water and also drains it. After 381 km, the river flows into the Indian Ocean.

In 1961, he encountered a young Jimmy Cliff outside of his shop singing a song he had written called \\"Dearest Beverley,\\" in the hopes that the mention of the establishment would convince Kong to record him.Alleyne, Mike (2012) The Encyclopedia of Reggae, Sterling, , p. 146 This encounter led Kong to launch his own record label, Beverley's, and to record Cliff's song, launching Cliff's career in the process. Cliff took on an A&R; role for the label, and brought Bob Marley to Kong's attention. In 1962, Kong recorded Marley's first single: \\"One Cup of Coffee\\" and \\"Judge Not\\", and Jimmy Cliff's first hit, \\"Miss Jamaica\\". Kong, known in Jamaican music circles as \\"the Chinaman\\", quickly established himself as the island's leading producer of local popular music. Throughout the 1960s Kong kept recording many leading Jamaican artists from ska to reggae through rocksteady including Joe Higgs, Desmond Dekker, Toots & the Maytals, Derrick Morgan, John Holt and Stranger Cole. A wise businessman, Kong was one of the original shareholders in Island Records along with Chris Blackwell and Australian engineer Graeme Goodall. Starting in 1963 Kong began licensing ska recordings to Blackwell for release in the UK on Island's Black Swan imprint. After Blackwell bought out Kong and Goodall's share in Island, in 1967 Kong formed a second partnership with Graeme Goodall, who created the Pyramid label in the UK for the successful release of Kong's rocksteady and early reggae productions. When Pyramid folded in 1969, the licensing successes continued with Trojan Records. Kong is known for being the first Jamaican producer to get international hits with long-time collaborator Desmond Dekker, in 1967 with \\"007 (Shanty Town)\\" and, above all, in 1969 with \\"Israelites\\" which topped the UK Singles Chart in April 1969 and went to number nine on the US charts in July 1969, selling over two million copies. During the early reggae period, he worked with Bob Marley and The Wailers (The Best of the Wailers) and enjoyed several successful hits with The Pioneers' \\"Long Shot Kick The Bucket\\", and The Melodians' \\"Rivers of Babylon\\" and \\"Sweet Sensation\\". His works with The Maytals also led to many hits including \\"54-46 That's My Number\\" and the UK charting single \\"Monkey Man\\". Matthew Sherman explains the relationship between The Maytals and Leslie Kong as, \\"From '69 to '71, Toots (Toots Hibbert) could do no wrong recording for Leslie Kong. With the consistent nucleus of musicians, the Beverley's All-Stars (Jackie Jackson, Winston Wright, Hux Brown, Rad Bryan, Paul Douglas and Winston Grennan) and the Maytals‚Äô brilliant harmonizing, Toots wrote and sang his unmistakable voice about every subject imaginable.Sherman, Matthew. \\"The Rise of Reggae and the Influence of Toots and the Maytals.\\" The Rise of Reggae, and the Influence of Toots and the Maytals. The Dread Library, n.d. Web. 18 Sept. 2016. http://debate.uvm.edu/dreadlibrary/sherman.html\\" Other vocalists who recorded for him and the Beverley's label include Ken Boothe, Bruce Ruffin, The Gaylads and Delroy Wilson. Ex-Skatalites saxophonist Roland Alphonso cut numerous instrumentals for Kong during the rocksteady period. When reggae arrived in late 1968, lead instrumental duties were handled by organists Ansell Collins and Winston Wright. Kong's plans to release a compilation album of tracks from the singles he produced by the Wailers led to Bunny Wailer allegedly threatening Kong with a curse, telling him that if he issued the record he would die. Kong went ahead with the release in 1970. Kong makes a cameo appearance in the now-classic Jamaican film The Harder They Come, playing a recording engineer in a scene in which Jimmy Cliff's character watches a studio recording session, by Toots and the Maytals, of the song \\"Sweet and Dandy\\" (Kong was the actual producer of that recording). Kong died of a heart attack, aged 38, in August 1971.

Biography Born in Turner, Maine, he was educated in local schools and at Maine's Hebron Academy. He was admitted to the bar in 1857 and served for nine years as prosecuting attorney for Hancock County, Maine. He was elected to the Maine Legislature 1867-68, to the U.S. House of Representatives 1869-79, serving in the 41st and four succeeding Congresses. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1878 to the 46th Congress. He was elected to succeed Hannibal Hamlin in the U.S. Senate in 1881; reelected in 1887, 1893, 1899 and 1905 and served from March 4, 1881, to March 3, 1911. During his time in the Senate, he served several committees, chairing, during various Congresses, the U.S. Senate Committee on the Census, the U.S. Senate Committee on Private Land Claims, the U.S. Senate Committee on Printing, the U.S. Senate Committee on Naval Affairs, the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations and the U.S. Senate Committee on Public Expenditures. He was Republican Conference Chairman from 1908 to 1911. Eugene Hale Although he declined the post of United States Secretary of the Navy in the Rutherford B. Hayes administration (and had previously declined a Cabinet appointment under Ulysses S. Grant), Senator Hale performed constructive work of the greatest importance in the area of naval appropriations, especially during the early fights for the \\"new Navy.\\" \\"I hope\\", he said in 1884, \\"that I shall not live many years before I shall see the American Navy what it ought to be, the pet of the American people.\\" Much later in his career, he opposed the building of large numbers of capital ships, which he regarded as less effective in proportion to cost and subject to rapid obsolescence. He was served as a member of the National Monetary Commission. Hale received an LL.D. from Bates College in 1882. During the late 1890s, Hale and Senator George F. Hoar of Massachusetts were the most vocal opponents of American intervention into the ongoing insurrection in Cuba. Hale disdained expansionism and jingoism and often challenged claims made by senators on Cuban military victories and Spanish atrocities. He so frequently engaged in verbal jousts with Cuban sympathizers in the Senate that they unfairly accused him of parroting Spanish propaganda and called him \\"The Senator from Spain.\\" Senator Hale retired from politics in 1911 and spent the remainder of his life in Ellsworth, Maine, and in Washington, D.C., where he died. He is buried in Woodbine Cemetery, Ellsworth, Maine. Two ships were named USS Hale for him. He was the father of Frederick Hale, also a U.S. Senator from Maine, and of diplomat Chandler Hale.

The bust has been said to show evidence of hemiplegia. Found in 1823 near the Jardin des Plantes and the amphitheatre of Lyon. On display at the Gallo-Roman Museum of Lyon. Lucius Munatius Plancus ( in Tibur - in Gaeta) was a Roman senator, consul in 42 BC, and censor in 22 BC with Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus. Along with Talleyrand eighteen centuries later, he is one of the classic historical examples of men who have managed to survive very dangerous circumstances by constantly shifting their allegiances. Early career Plancus's early career is rather unclear, and we know little about him, only that he was the namesake of his father, grandfather and great-grandfather. He was part of Julius Caesar's officer corps during the conquest of Gaul and the civil war against Pompey. His funerary inscription attests that he founded the cities of Augusta Raurica (44 BC) and Lugdunum (Lyon) (43 BC)Funerary inscription of Lucius Munatius Plancus Uchicago.edu and in June 43 BC, some letters attest to his passage through the village of Cularo (present Grenoble) in the Dauphin√© Alps.Cicero, Ad Familiares, X, 17, 18 & 23 Civil war A statue of Plancus in the city hall of Basel, Switzerland, the city's founder. When Caesar was assassinated on 15 March 44 BC, Plancus was the Proconsul of Gallia Comata. In the political confusion that followed, Plancus revealed himself as a master of non-committance in his extensive correspondence with Cicero. While Antony besieged Decimus Brutus in Mutina, Plancus wrote to the Senate in March 43 about his loyalty to the commonwealth, as well as of his need to disguise this during the consolidation of his position.D R Shackleton Bailey trans., Cicero‚Äôs Letters to his Friends (Atlanta 1988) p. 552-4 Thereafter he claimed that he would be unable to assist Brutus, as Marcus Aemilius Lepidus would block the movement of his troops: as he wrote to Cicero in May, ‚ÄúI should be ashamed to chop and change in my letters, were it not that these things depend on the fickleness of another person...Lepidus‚Äù.D R Shackleton Bailey trans., Cicero‚Äôs Letters to his Friends (Atlanta 1988) p. 580 After crossing the Alps into Gaul, apparently in support of Brutus, he repeatedly held back his troops from combat on the grounds that the time was not ripe;D R Shackleton Bailey trans., Cicero‚Äôs Letters to his Friends (Atlanta 1988) p. 634 and once Lepidus, Antony and Octavian formed the Second Triumvirate, he abandoned Brutus (and Cicero) to their fates by joining decisively with their opponent, Antony.D R Shackleton Bailey trans., Cicero‚Äôs Letters to his Friends (Atlanta 1988) p. 812 Thereafter he held the consulship with Lepidus in 42 BC, and became proconsul of Asia in about 40 BC. During Mark Antony's expedition (36 BC) to Armenia and Parthia, to avenge Crassus' death (17 years earlier) he was proconsul of Syria. But when Antony's campaign against the Parthians failed, he chose to leave him and join Octavian. According to Suetonius, Plancus was the one who suggested Octavian adopt the title \\"Augustus\\" rather than be called Romulus as a \\"second founder of Rome.\\"(Suet. Aug. 7) Under Augustus On 16 Jan. 27 BC, he proposed the title Augustus \\"revered one\\" be granted to the young princeps senatus. In 22 BC, Augustus appointed him and Aemilius Lepidus Paullus to fill the office of censor.Suet. Aug. 37Claud. 16Dio, liv.2 Their censorship is famous not for any remarkable deeds, but because it was the last time that such magistrates were appointed. According to Velleius Paterculus' Roman history,(II.95) it was a shame for both of the senators: In Suetonius' Life of Nero,(ch. 4) we read that the emperor Nero's grandfather, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, whose wife was Antonia Major, daughter of Mark Antony, \\"was haughty, extravagant, and cruel, and when he was only an aedile, forced the censor Lucius Plancus to make way for him on the street\\"; the story seems to hint at the poor reputation Plancus held after his censorship. Legacy Mausoleum of Plancus in Gaeta Plancus is one of the very few important Roman historical figures whose tomb has survived and is identifiable, although his body has long since vanished. The Mausoleum of Plancus, a massive cylindrical tomb now much restored (and consecrated to the Virgin Mary in the late 19th century), is in Gaeta, on a hill overlooking the sea: it houses a small permanent exhibit in honor of him. Plancus' children included one son and one daughter. His son was Lucius Munatius Plancus (ca 45 BC - aft. 14), consul in AD 13 and legate in 14, who married Aemilia Paulla, daughter of Aemilius Lepidus Paullus and wife Cornelia Lentula. In AD 14 the son went to Germany to help suppress the Rhine legions' mutiny with little success.Tacitus Annals, 1.39 Plancus' daughter Munatia Plancina (ca 35 BC - aft. 20) married the infamous Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, and they had two sons, Gnaeus and Marcus Piso. Plancina and her husband were accused of poisoning Germanicus.Tacitus Annals, 2.43.4, 2.74.2, 3.8-18; Dio 57.18.9 In Syria, she offended common sensibility by attending cavalry exercises and hired a notorious poisoner.Tacitus Annals, 2.55.5, 2.74.2 After the death of Germanicus, Piso and Plancina first tried to take back control of the province, then slowly returned to Rome, where they were put on trial for fomenting civil war and for poisoning Germanicus. Eventually Livia intervened to save Plancina and she was pardoned. Many years later in AD 34 she was again prosecuted and driven to suicide.Tacitus Annals, 6.24.4; Dio 58.22.5 Her two sons survived her.

It tells the story of two half-brothers, Michel and Bruno, and their mental struggles against their situations in modern society. It was translated into English by Frank Wynne as Atomised in the UK and as The Elementary Particles in the US. It won the International Dublin Literary Award for writer and translator. Plot Despite the essentially elaborate scope of the plot revealed in the novel's conclusion, the narrative focuses almost exclusively on the bleak and unrewarding day-to-day lives of the protagonists, two half-brothers who barely know each other. They seem devoid of love, and in their loveless or soon-to-be loveless journeys, Bruno becomes a saddened loner, wrecked by his upbringing and failure to individuate, while Michel's pioneering work in cloning removes love from the process of reproduction. Humans are proved, in the end, to be just particles and just as bodies decay (a theme in the book) they can also be created from particles. The story unfolds as a sort of framed narrative, so despite the events described therein having taken place mostly in 1999, the story is essentially set some fifty or so years in the future. A similar device was used by Kurt Vonnegut in the novel Gal√°pagos; however, unlike Vonnegut, Houellebecq only reveals the frame to the reader in the epilogue. Large sections of the story are presented in the form of suppertime storytelling dialogues between Michel, his childhood sweetheart Annabelle, Bruno, and Bruno's post-divorce girlfriend Christiane. The story focuses on the lives of Bruno Cl√©ment and Michel Djerzinski, two French half-brothers born of a hippie-type mother. Michel is raised by his paternal grandmother and becomes an introverted molecular biologist, who is ultimately responsible for the discoveries which lead to the elimination of sexual reproduction. Bruno's upbringing is much more tragic as described: shuffled and forgotten from one abusive boarding school to another, he eventually finds himself in a loveless marriage and teaching at a high school. Bruno grows into a lecherous and insatiable sex addict whose dalliances with prostitutes and sex chat on Minitel do nothing to satisfy him, to the point where he finds himself on disability leave from his job and in a mental hospital after a failed attempt at seducing one of his students. Reception The novel sold hundreds of thousands of copies and propelled Houellebecq into the French intellectual and literary spotlight during the summer and autumn of 1998. The vivid, almost pornographic, sexual descriptions were a frequent target of criticism, and Houellebecq himself attracted both scorn and praise for his erratic proclamations and behaviour in television interviews and the like. The author was eventually awarded the Prix Novembre in recognition of the novel. He became the last one to get this prize under this name. Philippe Dennery, the founder of the Prix Novembre, disapproved of awarding the prize to Houellebecq and resigned; the prize got a new patron‚ÄîPierre Berg√©‚Äîand a new name: Prix D√©cembre. In April 2008, Houellebecq's estranged mother, Lucie Ceccaldi, returned to France to publish The Innocent One, a rebuttal of his alleged mis-characterization of her parenting as contained in the novel. In press interviews, she promised that \\"if he has the misfortune of sticking my name on anything again he'll get my walking stick in his face and that'll knock his teeth out.\\" Film adaptation A film version premiered at the 2006 Berlin Film Festival and won the Silver Bear award. The German film Elementarteilchen was directed by Oskar Roehler, and had reportedly been sold to distributors in 23 countries within days of its premiere at the Berlin Film Festival.

The impounded off-stream reservoir is Waranga Basin and forms part of the Goulburn River irrigation system, irrigating an area of . The dam and reservoir are located in Shire of Campaspe near the City of Greater Shepparton and is located northeast of , southwest of Tatura, and near . When full, the reservoir covers an area of . The area now covered by the Waranga Basin includes a swamp that was known as Warranga (an indigenous word) or Gunn's after one of the early pastoralists who established his squatting run, also called Waranga, in the area surrounding the swamp. Gold was discovered near Waranga Swamp in 1853, making it one of Victoria's oldest goldfields. Construction Construction of the earth dam began in 1905 and was completed in 1915 using picks, shovels and horse-drawn scoops. The site of the basin was a former swamp in the then Waranga Shire. Construction of the dam was commissioned by the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission of Victoria for the irrigation of the Western Goulburn Valley. At the time of construction, the Waranga Basin embankment was described as the largest project of its sort in the world with an embankment height of and length of . Between 1915 and 1926, the embankment was raised in stages and a core wall was inserted. By 1921, the embankment was raised to allowing the storage capacity to be increased to , its current capacity. The major road between Tatura and Rushworth crosses the outlet. Distribution of the water Waranga Basin stores water flowing downstream from Lake Eildon as well as having a catchment area of its own. Waranga Basin supplies water to the Central Goulburn Irrigation Area and Rochester Irrigation Area. However, the Waranga Western Channel takes some of the water to Pyramid Hill and Boort.

In the last decade, gasoline engines equipped with indirect injection systems, wherein a fuel injector delivers the fuel at some point before the intake valve, have mostly fallen out of favor to direct injection. However, certain manufacturers such as Volkswagen, Toyota and Ford have developed a 'dual injection' system, combining direct injectors with port (indirect) injectors, combining the benefits of both types of fuel injection. Direct injection allows the fuel to be precisely metered into the combustion chamber under high pressure which can lead to greater power, fuel efficiency. The issue with direct injection is that it typically leads to greater amounts of particulate matter and with the fuel no longer contacting the intake valves, carbon can accumulate on the intake valves over time. Adding indirect injection keeps fuel spraying on the intake valves, reducing or eliminating the carbon accumulation on intake valves and in low load conditions, indirect injection allows for better fuel- air mixing. This system is mainly used in higher cost models due to the added expense and complexity. Port injection refers to the spraying of the fuel onto the back of the intake port, which speeds up its evaporation. An indirect injection diesel engine delivers fuel into a chamber off the combustion chamber, called a prechamber, where combustion begins and then spreads into the main combustion chamber. The prechamber is carefully designed to ensure adequate mixing of the atomized fuel with the compression-heated air.  Gasoline engines  An advantage of indirect injection gasoline engines versus direct injection gasoline engines is that deposits on intake valves from the crankcase ventilation system are washed by the fuel.  Diesel engines  =Overview= The purpose of the divided combustion chamber is to speed up the combustion process, in order to increase the power output by increasing engine speed.Stone, Richard. \\"An introduction to ICE\\", Palgrace Macmillan, 1999, p. 224 The addition of a prechamber, however, increases heat loss to the cooling system and thereby lowers engine efficiency. The engine requires glow plugs for starting. In an indirect injection system the air moves fast, mixing the fuel and air. This simplifies injector design and allows the use of smaller engines and less tightly toleranced designs which are simpler to manufacture and more reliable. Direct injection, by contrast, uses slow-moving air and fast-moving fuel; both the design and manufacture of the injectors is more difficult. The optimisation of the in-cylinder air flow is much more difficult than designing a prechamber. There is much more integration between the design of the injector and the engine.Two-stroke engine It is for this reason that car diesel engines were almost all indirect injection until the ready availability of powerful CFD simulation systems made the adoption of direct injection practical. =Gallery= Cylinder head of a small Kubota indirect injection diesel engine.

About 50% of the air enters the swirl chamber during the compression stroke of the engine, producing a swirl. After combustion, the products return through the same throat to the main cylinder at much higher velocity. So more heat loss to walls of the passage takes place. This type of chamber finds application in engines in which fuel control and engine stability are more important than fuel economy. These are Ricardo chambers, named after the inventor, Sir Harry Ricardo. Precombustion chamber This chamber is located at the cylinder head and is connected to the engine cylinder by small holes. It occupies 40% of the total cylinder volume. During the compression stroke, air from the main cylinder enters the precombustion chamber. At this moment, fuel is injected into the precombustion chamber and combustion begins. Pressure increases and the fuel droplets are forced through the small holes into the main cylinder, resulting in a very good mix of the fuel and air. The bulk of the combustion actually takes place in the main cylinder. This type of combustion chamber has multi-fuel capability because the temperature of the prechamber vaporizes the fuel before the main combustion event occurs. Air cell chamber The air cell is a small cylindrical chamber with a hole in one end. It is mounted more or less coaxially with the injector, said axis being parallel to the piston crown, with the injector firing across a small cavity which is open to the cylinder into the hole in the end of the air cell. The air cell is mounted so as to minimise thermal contact with the mass of the head. A pintle injector with a narrow spray pattern is used. At its top dead centre (TDC) the majority of the charge mass is contained in the cavity and air cell. When the injector fires, the jet of fuel enters the air cell and ignites. This results in a jet of flame shooting back out of the air cell directly into the jet of fuel still issuing from the injector. The heat and turbulence give excellent fuel vaporisation and mixing properties. Also since the majority of the combustion takes place outside the air cell in the cavity, which communicates directly with the cylinder, there is less heat loss involved in transferring the burning charge into the cylinder. Air cell injection can be considered as a compromise between indirect and direct injection, gaining some of the efficiency advantages of direct injection while retaining the simplicity and ease of development of indirect injection. Air cell chambers are commonly named Lanova air chambers. The Lanova combustion system was developed by the Lanova company, which was founded in 1929 by Franz Lang, Gotthard Wielich and Albert Wielich. In the US, the Lanova system was used by Mack Trucks. An example is the Mack-Lanova ED diesel engine fitted to the Mack NR truck. =Advantages of indirect injection combustion chambers= *Smaller diesels can be produced. *The injection pressure required is low, so the injector is cheaper to produce. *The injection direction is of less importance. *Indirect injection is much simpler to design and manufacture; less injector development is required and the injection pressures are low (1500 psi/100 bar versus 5000 psi/345 bar and higher for direct injection) *The lower stresses that indirect injection imposes on internal components mean that it is possible to produce petrol and indirect injection diesel versions of the same basic engine. At best such types differ only in the cylinder head and the need to fit a distributor and spark plugs in the petrol version whilst fitting an injection pump and injectors to the diesel. Examples include the BMC A-Series and B-Series engines and the Land Rover 2.25/2.5-litre 4-cylinder types. Such designs allow petrol and diesel versions of the same vehicle to be built with minimal design changes between them. *Higher engine speeds can be reached, since burning continues in the prechamber. *Alternative fuels like bio-diesel and waste vegetable oil are less likely to clog the fuel system in an indirect-injection diesel engine. In direct-injection engines, debris from previous use in the food industry can clog the injectors when waste vegetable oil is used. =Disadvantages= *Fuel efficiency is lower than with direct injection because of heat loss due to large exposed areas and pressure loss due to air motion through the throats. This is somewhat offset due to indirect injection having a much higher compression ratio and typically having no emissions equipment. *Glow plugs are needed for a cold engine start on diesel engines. *Because the heat and pressure of combustion is applied to one specific point on the piston as it exits the precombustion chamber or swirl chamber, such engines are less suited to high specific power outputs (such as turbocharging or tuning) than direct injection diesels. The increased temperature and pressure on one part of the piston crown causes uneven expansion which can lead to cracking, distortion or other damage due to improper use; use of \\"starting fluid\\" (ether) is not recommended in glow plug, indirect injection systems, because explosive knock can occur, causing engine damage.

Her music combines traditional and contemporary material. Lamond is known as the vocalist on Ashley MacIsaac's 1995 hit single \\"Sleepy Maggie\\", and for her solo Top 40 hit \\"Horo Ghoid thu Nighean\\", the first single from her 1997 album Suas e!. Her 2012 collaboration with fiddler Wendy MacIsaac, Seinn, was named one of the top 10 folk and americana albums of 2012 by National Public Radio in the United States. Early life and education Born in Kingston, Ontario, the youngest of five children, Lamond moved a number of times during her childhood, to a series of cities and towns in Ontario and Quebec. Her parents were both originally from Nova Scotia, however, and she often visited her father's parents in Cape Breton during her summer vacations. There she was first exposed to Celtic culture in general and to Gaelic music and the Gaelic language in particular. Lamond graduated from Westmount High School in Montreal, and then returned to Nova Scotia to enroll in the Celtic Studies program at St. Francis Xavier University, where she studied the school's collection of 350 field recordings of traditional Scots-Gaelic songs. She graduated with a minor in Music at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, Nova Scotia. Career While still a student, Lamond recorded an album of traditional material called Bho Thir Nan Craobh (From the Land of the Trees), which she released independently in 1994. Among the musicians on the album was fiddler Ashley MacIsaac. MacIsaac had first seen Lamond perform in 1991 with a local band in Antigonish and was impressed with what he saw as her \\"punk attitude,\\" even as she was singing Gaelic songs. MacIsaac and Lamond collaborated again in 1995 on the song \\"Sleepy Maggie\\" for his album Hi‚Ñ¢ How Are You Today?, which became a breakthrough recording for both of them. Lamond followed this up with a solo album in 1997 called Suas e! (which in English means, roughly, \\"Go for it!\\"). The album was nominated for a Juno Award and an East Coast Music award. She released L√†n D√πil in 1999, which cultural magazine PopMatters said \\"should establish her as a major talent in Celtic and world music. Orain Gh√†idhlig, most of which was recorded live in North River, Cape Breton Island, followed in 2001. After 2000, Lamond mostly put her solo recording career aside for a variety of other projects, including composition for film and stage, and working with a variety of cultural agencies. Her most recent solo album to date is the 2005 recording St√≤ras, which means \\"a treasure\\" in English. Also in 2005, she contributed the song \\"Mo Mhaeli Bheag Og\\" to the charity album Voyces United for UNHCR. She has been active in the ongoing preservation and revitalization of the Scottish Gaelic culture in Cape Breton as a member of the Gaelic Council of Nova Scotia and the Creative Nova Scotia Leadership Council, and as a teacher of Gaelic language and song workshops. In September 2012, Lamond and fiddler Wendy McIsaac released the album Seinn. \\"Their guitar-and-fiddle matchup is beautifully balanced, behind butter-smooth vocals and timeless melodies,\\" said a reviewer on NPR, which named the album as one of the year's top 10 folk and Americana albums. In November 2013, Seinn won a Canadian Folk Music Award for traditional album of the year and a Music Nova Scotia award for traditional/roots recording of the year. Current work In September 2017, Lamond announced a new collaborative project, Patchwork, \\"a project dedicated to the presentation of traditional song in a contemporary context.\\" Patchwork consists of Lamond and her first cousin, Laurel MacDonald, who perform Gaelic and English language songs. They perform a show entitled \\"She Sings as She Flies: Revisiting the Helen Creighton Song Collection,\\" and will be joined by Nicole LeBlanc, Kirsten Olivia, and Naomi Dawn Poulette singing songs from the Acadian, African Nova Scotian, and Mi'kmaq communities, respectively.

He was appointed a Midshipman in November 1826 and was assigned to the Boston Navy Yard until 1830, when he began two years at sea on board the brig Porpoise. For the rest of the 1830s and the 1840s he had duties ashore and afloat, receiving his commission as Lieutenant in 1837, while serving in the ship of the line North Carolina. He was an officer in the steamer Princeton during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and executive officer of the frigate St. Lawrence in 1851. Promoted to the rank of Commander in 1855, Boggs commanded two mail steamers during the next four years and was a lighthouse inspector at San Francisco, California in 1860-1861. Civil War service In December 1861 Boggs was given command of the gunboat . The following April, during the Capture of New Orleans, he commanded her with distinction: > In the attack of the squadron on the Mississippi forts, April 18‚Äì24 ... he > destroyed six of the Confederate gunboats, but finally lost his own vessel, > after driving his antagonist ashore in flames.

The selections include short stories, plays, and excerpts of material cut from her novels We the Living and The Fountainhead. Publishing history Author Ayn Rand died in March 1982, after a long career that included four published novels, two Broadway plays, several produced screenplays, and numerous non-fiction essays and speeches. She left her literary estate, including her unpublished manuscripts, to her longtime friend and prot√©g√© Leonard Peikoff. Peikoff compiled a selection of her unpublished fiction into The Early Ayn Rand. Although many of the pieces included were never meant to be published, the collection shows Rand's development as a writer. In the introduction, Peikoff writes he \\"decided to publish this material because I believe that admirers of Miss Rand will be interested to learn by what steps she developed her literary abilities. They can now see the steps themselves.\\"Peikoff, Leonard. \\"Introduction\\". In This book is volume two of the \\"Ayn Rand Library\\" series edited by Peikoff. It was first published in a hardcover edition by New American Library in 1984. They published paperback edition in 1986. A revised and expanded edition was published in 2005. Contents The first edition begins with four unpublished short stories written in the 1920s. The next section starts with a synopsis of Red Pawn, a 1932 screenplay that was Rand's first professional sale as a writer.Peikoff, Leonard. \\"Editor's Preface\\" to Red Pawn. In This is followed by unpublished excerpts from Rand's first novel, We the Living, which was completed in 1934 and published in 1936. The section ends with a previously unpublished and unproduced play, Ideal, which was written in the mid-1930s. (Ideal was later produced in 1989 by Michael Paxton.) The third section begins with Think Twice, a theatrical murder mystery written in 1939. Peikoff writes that in conversation about this play, Rand told him \\"She could not ... write a series of mysteries, because everyone would know who the murderers were.\\"Peikoff, Leonard. \\"Editor's Preface\\" to Think Twice. In It is followed by unpublished excerpts from Rand's 1943 novel The Fountainhead - especially, the sections describing the relationship of the protagonist Howard Roark with actress Vesta Dunning, an episode of considerable importance in the original text and removed from the final version. The revised edition adds two short stories. \\"The Night King\\" was a previously unpublished story written in around 1926. \\"The Simplest Thing in the World\\" was written in 1940 and previously published in a 1967 issue of The Objectivist and in Rand's 1969 book The Romantic Manifesto. Reception Upon its initial publication in 1984, the book received only a few reviews, which were mostly positive. These included reviews in the Los Angeles Times and the Detroit Free Press. In a review for the libertarian magazine Reason, literature professor Stephen D. Cox said the collection was \\"very interesting\\" and revealed details of Rand's personality, although the writing in the selections was inferior to her previously published work. Looking back on the book years later, Rand scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein said reading it is \\"a pleasurable experience\\" that shows Rand's \\"nascent virtuosity\\". In her article about Rand for Contemporary Women Philosophers, Jenny Heyl said the selections show Rand's \\"strong flair for the dramatic\\" and foreshadow themes from her later work.

Selmer, a French manufacturer, produced the instrument from 1932 to about 1952. History Reconstruction of a portion of the Selmer-Maccaferri guitar workshop (1933), Mus√©e de la Musique exhibition, 2012 In 1932 Selmer partnered with the Italian guitarist and luthier Mario Maccaferri to produce a line of acoustic guitars based on Maccaferri's unorthodox design.https://www.vintageguitar.com/1742/maccaferri-history/ Although Maccaferri's association with Selmer ended in 1934, the company continued to make several models of this guitar until 1952. The guitar was closely associated with jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt. Construction In its archetypal steel-string Jazz/Orchestre form, the Selmer is distinguished by a fairly large body with squarish bouts, either a \\"D\\"-shaped or longitudinal oval sound hole, and a cutaway in the upper right bout. The strings pass over a movable bridge and are gathered at the tail, as on a mandolin. Two \\"moustache\\" markers are fixed to the soundboard to help position the movable bridge. The top of the guitar is gently arched or domed--a feature achieved by bending a flat piece of wood rather than by the violin-style carving used in archtop guitars. The top is also rather thin, at about . It has a comparatively wide fretboard (about at the nut) and a snake-shaped, slotted headstock. The back and top are both ladder-braced, which was the norm for French and Italian steel-string guitars of the time (unlike American guitars, which frequently employed X-braced tops by this period). Other models can be more conventional in appearance and construction, with the Mod√®le Classique, for example, essentially being a standard fan-braced, flat-top classical guitar. Early days - \\"Maccaferri\\" or D-hole guitar Tony Green's \\"Gypsy Jazz\\" group photographed in New Orleans in 2012. The lead player (right) performs on a \\"petite bouche\\", oval hole Selmer-style instrument; the rhythm player (left) uses a modern modification of the original Selmer \\"grande bouche\\" / D-hole instrument, with 14 frets clear of the body as opposed to the 12 frets of the original design. Early models have a large, D-shaped sound hole (the \\"grande bouche\\", or \\"big mouth\\"), which was shaped specifically to accommodate an internal resonator invented by luthier Mario Maccaferri ‚Äì this was designed to increase the volume of the guitar and to even out variations in volume and tone between different strings. The scale, at 640 mm, and fretting of the early guitars was very similar to other contemporary guitars (including the Gibson and Martin guitar designs from which most modern acoustic guitar patterns ultimately derive), but with a wide fretboard more typical of a classical guitar; they also had 12 frets clear of the body, although left hand higher fret access was facilitated by a (then novel) cutaway in the upper right bout. These guitars were made in several versions, including gut string (classical), steel string, seven string (Hawaiian) and four string (\\"Grand\\" and \\"T√©nor\\") versions, plus a special four string \\"Eddie Freeman\\" model (see below). Many of these guitars, produced during 1932 and 1933, were sold to the UK market via Selmer's London showroom (which also distributed the guitar to regional dealers) and it was during this period that the guitars became known as \\"Maccaferris\\" to Britons. Post-Maccaferri or Oval-Hole guitar Original (?) oval-hole / \\"petite bouche\\" Selmer guitar being played by Stochelo Rosenberg, 2012 Maccaferri designed the original guitars and oversaw their manufacture, but his involvement with Selmer ended after 18 months. Over the next few years, the design evolved without his input (including some transitional models with round soundholes). By 1936, the definitiveCharle, Story of... p.123 version of the Selmer guitar had appeared, with an oval hole in pace of the large D-shaped hole, no internal resonator, and a neck with 14 frets clear of the body in place of the original 12. It was officially called the \\"Mod√®le Jazz\\", but also known as the \\"Petite Bouche\\" (small mouth) or \\"Oval Hole\\". These later guitars also have revised internal bracing and a longer scale length of . The vast bulk of guitars produced after the Maccaferri period were sold in Selmer's native France; these later guitars are always referred to as \\"Selmers\\" (as are the earlier guitars by the French). While Maccaferri may no longer have been around (and his resonator had been abandoned), the later guitars retain many unusual characteristics of his original innovative design, including the cutaway, the world's first sealed oil-bath machine heads and a top that is bent, mandolin-style, behind the floating bridge - something that contributes to the guitar's remarkable volume when played. Use Before the advent of amplification, the Selmer guitar appealed to European players the way archtop guitars did in America: it was loud enough to hear over other instruments in a band. The \\"petite bouche\\" model has an especially loud and cutting voice, and remains the design preferred by lead players in Django-style bands, while the accompanying rhythm players often use D-hole instruments. (This was the lineup in Django's Quintette du Hot Club de France during its classic period in the late 1930s, and it remains the pattern for bands that emulate it.) Modern exponents of the style often amplify their instruments in concert, but may still play acoustically in small venues and jam sessions. Gypsy jazz players usually couple the guitar with light, silver-plated, copper-wound Argentine strings made by Savarez (or copies of these), and heavy plectrums, traditionally of tortoiseshell. Today, the Selmer guitar is almost completely associated with Django Reinhardt and the \\"gypsy jazz\\" school of his followers. From the 1930s through to the 1950s, however, Selmers were used by all types of performer in France and (in the early days) in the UK. The first Selmers sold in the UK were used in standard dance bands, and were associated with performers such as Len Fillis and Al Bowlly. In France, the Selmer was the top professional guitar for many years, and is heard in everything from musette to the backing of chansonniers. Leading players included Henri Crolla and Sacha Distel. More recently, the style of guitar (albeit a modification developed by Favino) has been associated with Enrico Macias. Other Selmer guitars Though best known for its steel-string D-hole and oval-hole guitars (known initially as the \\"Orchestre\\" and later the \\"Jazz\\" model), during the Maccaferri period Selmer also made and sold Maccaferri-designed classical guitars, harp guitars, 6- and 7-string Hawaiian guitars, tenor guitars, a 4-string \\"Grande\\" model and the \\"Eddie Freeman Special\\", a 4-string guitar with the scale-length and body-size of a standard guitar, designed to use with a special reentrant tuning that was briefly successful in the UK market. Most of these instruments featured Macaferri's distinctive D-shaped sound hole and cutaway design, and many contained the resonator. Production of all but the Mod√®le Jazz ended by the mid-1930s. Selmer also contracted the well-known American luthier John D'Angelico to construct a small number of archtop guitars to be sold under the Selmer brand for the U.S. market; this arrangement was short-lived and apparently only three instruments were constructed, of which a single one (from 1934) is known to survive (see DjangoBooks website).  Copies, replicas and similar guitars  Copy of a Selmer Maccaferri guitar. Selmer did not make many guitars‚Äîfewer than 1,000‚Äîand the company stopped all production by 1952. Playable original Selmers are rare and command high prices. Before the current rise in interest in Django and his guitars, other European builders produced instruments that emulated the Selmer design with their own variations. These instruments began to appear in the 1930s with Busato, Di Mauro and‚Äîfrom the 1940s‚ÄîJacobacci, Favino, Anasatasio, the G√©r√¥me Brothers, Olivieri, Rossi, Bucolo, Patenotte, Siro Burgassi, and a few others.Charle, Story of... p.217 In the 1970s, Selmer copies were produced in Japan for CSL and Ibanez, and in the 1980s for Saga Musical Instruments under the \\"Saga\\" brand. Meanwhile, a few French luthiers continued production. These include Jean-Pierre Favino and, more recently, Maurice Dupont. Elsewhere, some high grade luthiers have offered Selmer-style guitars. These include Jerome Duffell, AJL (Ari-Jukka Luomaranta), John Le Voi, David Hodson, Rob Aylward, Chris Eccleshall, and Doug Kyle in the U.K., Michael Dunn and Shelley D. Park in Canada, Leo Eimers in the Netherlands, and Rodrigo Shopis in New York City. More recently, inexpensive factory instruments from Asia have become available under the Gitane and Dell'Arte/John S. Kinnard brands. Common departures from the original designs include omitting the internal resonator, adding a scratchplate, using solid (non-laminated) woods, and building D-hole models with a 14th fret neck-join rather than the original 12th fret join. Surviving original Selmers The number of surviving original Selmer guitars is not known exactly. Fewer than 200 are publicly known, and appear on the list below. Previously unknown instruments surface from time to time, and some no doubt remain undocumented in the hands of gypsy players or in private collections.

Following his severance from Selmer, in 1939 Maccaferri moved to the United States and became interested in plastic manufacturing. He produced plastic classical and steel-string guitars -- of similar shape to his Selmer designs, albeit with F-holes -- in the 1950s and 60s, along with many musical and non-musical plastic products. Produced first under his own name, and after 1964 under the name \\"Mastro\\", the guitars were of short scale, but accurately fretted and intonated. These instruments were not a huge success at the time and are now considered oddities.Plastic Maccaferri However, the many variants of Maccaferri's plastic ukulele enjoyed a considerable vogue in the 1950s and sold in large numbers.Wright, Michael (3 March 2002). \\"Maccaferri History: The Guitars of Mario Maccaferri\\". Maccaferri also collaborated with Ibanez guitars in the late 1970s and early 1980s to produce 440 updated versions of his original D-hole design (additional information herehttp://www.djangobooks.com/Item/csl-maccaferri). They were individually signed by him and are considered quite playable and collectable.  Sources  * Charle, Fran√ßois. L'Histoire des guitares Selmer Maccaferri.

Wheeled robots are typically quite energy efficient and simple to control. However, other forms of locomotion may be more appropriate for a number of reasons, for example traversing rough terrain, as well as moving and interacting in human environments. Furthermore, studying bipedal and insect-like robots may beneficially impact on biomechanics. A major goal in this field is in developing capabilities for robots to autonomously decide how, when, and where to move. However, coordinating numerous robot joints for even simple matters, like negotiating stairs, is difficult. Autonomous robot locomotion is a major technological obstacle for many areas of robotics, such as humanoids (like Honda's Asimo).  Types of locomotion  = Walking = * See Passive dynamics * See Zero Moment Point * See Leg mechanism * See Hexapod (robotics) Klann linkage walking motion Walking robots simulate human or animal gait, as a replacement for wheeled motion. Legged motion makes it possible to negotiate uneven surfaces, steps, and other areas that would be difficult for a wheeled robot to reach, as well as causes less damage to environmental terrain as wheeled robots, which would erode it. Hexapod robots are based on insect locomotion, most popularly the cockroach and stick insect, whose neurological and sensory output is less complex than other animals. Multiple legs allow several different gaits, even if a leg is damaged, making their movements more useful in robots transporting objects. Examples of advanced running robots include ASIMO, BigDog, HUBO 2, RunBot, and Toyota Partner Robot. =Rolling= In terms of energy efficiency on flat surfaces, wheeled robots are the most efficient. This is because an ideal rolling (but not slipping) wheel loses no energy. A wheel rolling at a given velocity needs no input to maintain its motion. This is in contrast to legged robots which suffer an impact with the ground at heelstrike and lose energy as a result.Segway in the Robot museum in Nagoya. For simplicity most mobile robots have four wheels or a number of continuous tracks. Some researchers have tried to create more complex wheeled robots with only one or two wheels. These can have certain advantages such as greater efficiency and reduced parts, as well as allowing a robot to navigate in confined places that a four-wheeled robot would not be able to. Examples: Boe-Bot, Cosmobot, Elmer, Elsie, Enon, HERO, IRobot Create, iRobot's Roomba, Johns Hopkins Beast, Land Walker, Modulus robot, Musa, Omnibot, PaPeRo, Phobot, Pocketdelta robot, Push the Talking Trash Can, RB5X, Rovio, Seropi, Shakey the robot, Sony Rolly, Spykee, TiLR, Topo, TR Ara√±a, and Wakamaru. =Hopping= Several robots, built in the 1980s by Marc Raibert at the MIT Leg Laboratory, successfully demonstrated very dynamic walking. Initially, a robot with only one leg, and a very small foot, could stay upright simply by hopping. The movement is the same as that of a person on a pogo stick. As the robot falls to one side, it would jump slightly in that direction, in order to catch itself. Soon, the algorithm was generalised to two and four legs. A bipedal robot was demonstrated running and even performing somersaults. A quadruped was also demonstrated which could trot, run, pace, and bound. Examples: * The MIT cheetah cub is an electrically powered quadruped robot with passive compliant legs capable of self-stabilizing in large range of speeds. * The Tekken II is a small quadruped designed to walk on irregular terrains adaptively. =Metachronal motion= Coordinated, sequential mechanical action having the appearance of a traveling wave is called a metachronal rhythm or wave, and is employed in nature by ciliates for transport, and by worms and arthropods for locomotion. =Slithering= Several snake robots have been successfully developed. Mimicking the way real snakes move, these robots can navigate very confined spaces, meaning they may one day be used to search for people trapped in collapsed buildings. The Japanese ACM-R5 snake robotACM-R5 can even navigate both on land and in water.Swimming snake robot (commentary in Japanese) Examples: Snake-arm robot, Roboboa, and Snakebot. =Swimming= *See Autonomous underwater vehicles =Brachiating= Brachiation allows robots to travel by swinging, using energy only to grab and release surfaces.\\"Video: Brachiating 'Bot Swings Its Arm Like An Ape\\" This motion is similar to an ape swinging from tree to tree. The two types of brachiation can be compared to bipedal walking motions (continuous contact) or running (richochetal). Continuous contact is when a hand/grasping mechanism is always attached to the surface being crossed; richochetal employs a phase of aerial \\"flight\\" from one surface/limb to the next. =Hybrid= Robots can also be designed to perform locomotion in multiple modes. For example, the Bipedal Snake Robo Rohan Thakker, Ajinkya Kamat, Sachin Bharambe, Shital Chiddarwar and K. M. Bhurchandi. ‚ÄúReBiS- Reconfigurable Bipedal Snake Robot.‚Äù In Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, 2014. can both slither like a snake and walk like a biped robot.  Biologically inspired Locomotion  The desire to create robots with dynamic locomotive abilities has driven scientists to look to nature for solutions. Several robots capable of basic locomotion in a single mode have been invented but are found to lack several capabilities hence limiting its functions and applications. Highly intelligent robots are needed in several areas such as search and rescue missions, battlefields, and landscape investigation. Thus robots of this nature need to be small, light, quick, and possess the ability to move in multiple locomotive modes. As it turns out, multiple animals have provided inspiration for the design of several robots. Some of such animals are: Pteryomini (Flying Squirrel) Illustrative image of the flying squirrel (Pteromyini) The Pteryomini exhibits great mobility while on land by making use of its quadruped walking with high DoF legs. In air, the Pteryomini glides through by utilizing lift forces from the membrane between its legs. It possesses a highly flexible membrane that allows for unrestrained movement of its legs. It uses its highly elastic membrane to glide while in air and it demonstrates lithe movement on the ground. In addition, the Pteryomini is able to exhibit multi-modal locomotion due to the membrane that connects the fore and hind legs which also enhances its gliding ability. It has been proven that a flexible membrane possesses a higher lift coefficient than rigid plates and delays the angle of attack at which stall occurs. The flying squirrel also possesses thick bundles on the edges of its membrane, wingtips and tail which helps to minimize fluctuations and unnecessary energy loss. Image showing the location of the uropatagium The Pteromyini is able to boost its gliding ability due to the numerous physical attributes it possesses The flexible muscle structure serves multiple purposes. For one, the Plagiopatagium, which serves as the primary generator of lift for the flying squirrel, is able to effectively function due to its thin and flexible muscles. The Plagiopatagium is able to control tension on the membrane due to contraction and expansion. Tension control can ultimately help in energy savings due to minimized fluttering of the membrane. Once it lands, the Pteromyini contracts its membrane to ensure that the membrane does not sag when it is walking The propatagium and uropatagium serve to provide extra lift for the Pteromyini. While the propatagium is situated between the head and forelimbs of the flying squirrel, the uropatagium is located at the tail and hind limbs and these serve to provide the flying squirrel with increased agility and drag for landing. Additionally, the flying squirrel possesses thick rope-like muscle structures on the edges of its membrane to maintain the shape of the membrane s. These muscular structures called platysma, tibiocarpalis, and semitendinosus, are located on the propatagium and, plagiopatagium and uropatagium respectively. These thick muscle structures serve to guard against unnecessary fluttering due to strong wind pressures during gliding hence minimizing energy loss. The wingtips are situated at the forelimb wrists and serve to form an airfoil which minimizes the effect of induced drag due to the formation of wingtip vortices. The wingtips dampen the effects of the vortices and obstructs the induced drag from affecting the whole wing. The Pteryomini is able to unfold and fold its wingtips while gliding by using its thumbs. This serves to prevent undesired sagging of the wingtips. The tail of the flying squirrel allows for improved gliding abilities as it plays a critical role. As opposed to other vertebrates, the Pteromyini possesses a tail that is flattened to gain more aerodynamic surface as it glides. This also allows the flying squirrel to maintain pitch angle stability of its tail. This is particularly useful during landing as the Pteromyini is able to widen its pitch angle and induce more drag so as to decelerate and land safely Furthermore, the legs and tail of the Pteromyini serve to control its gliding direction. Due to the flexibility of the membranes around the legs, the chord angle and dihedral angle between the membrane and coronal plane of the body is controlled. This allows the animal to create rolling, pitching, and yawing moment which in turn control the speed and direction of the gliding. During landing, the animal is able to rapidly reduce its speed by increasing drag and changing its pitch angle using its membranes and further increasing air resistance by loosening the tension between the membranes of its legs Desmodus Rotundus (Vampire Bat) Image showing the Desmodus Rotundus (vampire bat) The common vampire bats are known to possess powerful modes of terrestrial locomotion, such as jumping, and aerial locomotion such as gliding. Several studies have demonstrated that the morphology of the bat enables it to easily and effectively alternate between both locomotive modes. The anatomy that aids in this is essentially built around the largest muscle in the body of the bat pectorialis profundus (posterior division). Between the two modes of locomotion, there are three bones that are shared. These three main bones are integral parts of the arm structure namely: humerus, ulna, and radius. Since there already exists a sharing of components for both modes, no additional muscles are needed when transitioning from jumping to gliding. Image showing the schistocerca gregaria (desert dwelling locust) A detailed study of the morphology of the shoulder of the bat shows that the bones of the arm are slightly more sturdy and the ulna and the radius have been fused so as to accommodate heavy reaction forces from the ground Schistocerca gregaria (Desert Dwelling locust) The desert dwelling locust is known for its ability to jump and fly over long distances as well as crawl on land. A detailed study of the anatomy of this organism would provide some detail about the mechanisms for locomotion. The hind legs of the locust are developed for jumping. They possess a semi-lunar process which consists of the large extensor tibiae muscle, small flexor tibiae muscle, and banana shaped thickened cuticle. When the tibiae muscle flexes, the mechanical advantage of the muscles and the vertical thrust component of the leg extension are increased. These desert dwelling locusts utilize a catapult mechanism wherein the energy is first stored in the hind legs and then released to extend the legs. In order for a perfect jump to occur, the locust must push its legs on the ground with a strong enough force so as to initiate a fast take off The force must be adequate enough in order to attain a quick take off and decent jump height. The force must also be generated quickly. In order to effectively transition from the jumping mode to the flying mode, the insect must adjust the time during the wing opening to maximize the distance and height of jump. When it is at the zenith of its jump, the flight mode becomes actuated.  Multi-Modal Robot locomotion based on Bio-inspiration  Modeling of a multi-modal walking and gliding robot after the Pteryomini (Flying squirrel) Following the discovery of the requisite model to mimic, researchers sought to design a legged robot that was capable of achieving effective motion in aerial and terrestrial environments by the use of a flexible membrane. Thus, to achieve this goal, the following design considerations had to be taken into account: 1\\\\. The shape and area of the membrane had to be consciously selected so that the intended aerodynamic capabilities of this membrane could be achieved. Additionally, the design of the membrane would affect the design of the legs since the membrane is attached to the legs. 2\\\\. The membrane had to be flexible enough to allow for unrestricted movement of the legs during gliding and walking. However, the amount of flexibility had to be controlled due to the fact that excessive flexibility could lead to a significant loss of energy caused by the oscillations at regions of the membrane where strong pressure occur. 3\\\\. The leg of the robot had to be designed to allow for appropriate torques for walking as well as gliding In order to incorporate these factors, close attention had to be paid to the characteristics of the Pteryomini. The aerodynamic features of the robot were modeled using the dynamic modeling and simulation. By imitating the thick muscle bundles of the membrane of the Pteryomini, the designers were able to minimize the fluctuations and oscillations on the membrane edges of the robot thus reducing needless energy loss. Furthermore, the amount of drag on the wing of the robot was reduced by the use of retractable wingtips thereby allowing for improved gliding abilities. Moreover, the leg of the robot was designed to incorporate sufficient torque after mimicking the anatomy of the Pteryomini‚Äôs leg using virtual work analysis. Following the design of the leg and membrane of the robot, its average gliding ratio (GR) was determined to be 1.88. The robot functioned effectively, walking in several gait patterns and crawling with its high DoF legs. The robot was also able to land safely. These performances demonstrated the gliding and walking capabilities of the robot and its multi- modal locomotion Modeling of a multi-modal jumping and gliding robot after the Desmodus Rotundus (Vampire Bat) The design of the robot called Multi-Mo Bat involved the establishment of four primary phases of operation: energy storage phase, jumping phase, coasting phase, and gliding phase. The energy storing phase essentially involves the reservation of energy for the jumping energy. This energy is stored in the main power springs. This process additionally creates a torque around the joint of the shoulders which in turn configures the legs for jumping. Once the stored energy is released, the jump phase can be initiated. When the jump phase is initiated and the robot takes off from the ground, it transitions to the coast phase which occurs until the acme is reached and it begins to descend. As the robot descends, drag helps to reduce the speed at which it descends as the wing is reconfigured due to increased drag on the bottom of the airfoils. At this stage, the robot glides down. The anatomy of the arm of the vampire bat plays a key role in the design of the leg of the robot. In order to minimize the number of Degrees of Freedom (DoFs), the two components of the arm are mirrored over the xz plane. This then creates the four-bar design of the leg structure of the robot which results in only 2 independent DoFs. Modeling of a multi-modal jumping and flying robot after the Schistocerca gregaria (Desert Dwelling Locust) The robot designed was powered by a single DC motor which integrated the performances of jumping and flapping. It was designed as an incorporation of the inverted slider-crank mechanism for the construction of the legs, a dog- clutch system to serve as the mechanism for winching, and a rack-pinion mechanism used for the flapping-wing system. This design incorporated a very efficient energy storage and release mechanism and an integrated wing flapping mechanism. A robot with features similar to the locust was developed. The primary feature of the robot‚Äôs design was a gear system powered by a single motor which allowed the robot to perform its jumping and flapping motions. Just like the motion of the locust, the motion of the robot is initiated by the flexing of the legs to the position of maximum energy storage after which the energy is released immediately to generate the force necessary to attain flight. The robot was tested for performance and the results demonstrated that the robot was able to jump to an approximate height of 0.9m while weighing 23g and flapping its wings at a frequency of about 19 Hz. The robot tested without its flapping wings performed less impressively showing about 30% decrease in jumping performance as compared to the robot with the wings. These results are quite impressive as it is expected that the reverse be the case since the weight of the wings should have impacted the jumping  Approaches  * Product optimization * Motion planning * Motion capture may be performed on humans, insects and other organisms. * Machine learning, typically with reinforcement learning.

The name Pialligo has been used for the area since at least 1820, and is probably of Aboriginal origin. It was also the name for the parish in the area. Streets in Pialligo are named with Aboriginal words. Beltana Road in Pialligo is home to many of Canberra's nurseries. Canberra Airport is located adjacent to Pialligo across Pialligo Avenue. Geology Quaternary alluvium covers the main western part of Pialligo. Calcareous shales from the Canberra Formation are deep underneath. The Woolshed Creek runs into the north end of Pialligo. This is a significant place, because in the bed of the creek the Rev W B Clarke first recognised Silurian fossils. These fossils were brachiopods, mostly Atrypa duntroonensis. He discovered them around 1844 century and it was the first time that Silurian rocks were identified in Australia, and at the time were the oldest known rocks in Australia.

It currently has three active battalions, and is readily identified by its nickname, The Old Guard, as well as Escort to the President. The regimental motto is Noli Me Tangere (from Latin: ‚Äì \\"Touch Me Not\\"). The regiment is a major unit of the Military District of Washington (MDW). The regiment is the oldest currently-active regiment in the Regular Army, having been first organized as the First American Regiment in 1784.U.S. Army. (1999.) \\"Organizational History\\". United States Army Center of Military History, website publication, page 29. Retrieved on 4 October 2007. An American Revolutionary War unit in the 3rd US Infantry lineage was Captain John Doughty's Company of the 2nd Continental Artillery Regiment which had been attached to the 1st American Regiment (1783-1784) and then was part of the First American Regiment of 1784‚Äì1791. It has been the official ceremonial unit of the US Army since 1948. Mission The regiment's mission is to conduct memorial affairs to honor fallen comrades and ceremonies and special events to represent the U.S. Army, communicating its story to United States citizens and the world. Although The Old Guard primarily functions in a ceremonial role, it is an infantry unit and thus required to meet standards for certification in its combat role. The unit also trains for its support role to civil authorities in a wide range of scenarios and for deployments in support of overseas contingency operations. On order, it conducts defense in support of civil authorities in the National Capital Region and deploys elements in support of overseas contingency operations. Memorial affairs and ceremonial mission thumb Memorial affairs missions include standard and full honors funerals in Arlington National Cemetery and dignified transfers at Dover Air Force Base. Old Guard soldiers also perform all dignified transfers of fallen soldiers returning to the United States. The Old Guard's ceremonial task list includes full honor arrivals for visiting dignitaries, wreath ceremonies at the Tomb of the Unknowns, and full honor reviews in support of senior army leaders and retiring soldiers. Special events include the Twilight Tattoo, a weekly performance in the adjacent Washington area on Wednesday evenings from May to July, and the Spirit of America, a historical pageant presented at three national venues in September. The Old Guard is the only unit in the U.S. Armed Forces authorized, by a 1922 decree of the War Department, to march with fixed bayonets in all parades. This was granted in honor of the 1847 bayonet charge by the regiment during the Battle of Cerro Gordo in the war with Mexico. =Specialty units= In addition to the marching platoons, there are also elements of The Old Guard that serve special roles unique both to the regiment as well as the US Army. Among these include the sentinels of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, maintaining a twenty-four-hour watch over one of the nation's most sacred sites; the Continental Color Guard, which presents the nation's colors at special events across the Capitol Region; the Presidential Salute Battery, which renders honors to senior dignitaries at arrival and wreath ceremonies, reviews, and full honors funerals; and the US Army Caisson Platoon, which provides horses and riders to pull the caisson (the wagon that bears a casket) in military and state funerals. The Old Guard's Caisson Platoon at Arlington National Cemetery The Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps on parade in October 2006 The Caisson Platoon also provides the riderless horses used in full honors funerals and supports wounded warriors participating in the Therapeutic Riding Program. Other elements of The Old Guard include the Commander-in-Chief's Guard (Company A), replicating the personal guard of General George Washington; wearing Colonial blue uniforms, powdered wigs, and cocked hats; and bearing Brown Bess muskets and halberds at ceremonies and special events; the US Army Drill Team, which demonstrates its skill and precision around the nation, and Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps, which plays traditional arrangements of marching music, dating back to the time of the Continental Army. The Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps marches in Colonial style red coated uniforms‚Äîto be \\"better seen through the smoke of battle\\"; the uniforms also include cocked hats and white powdered wigs. The drum major of the Fife and Drum Corps traditionally bears an espontoon (a historic pike-like weapon) in his right hand to direct and command his unit. As such, he is the only soldier in all the U.S. Armed Forces authorized to bear a spontoon and to salute with the left hand (although U.S. Navy personnel are allowed to salute with the left hand under certain conditions). Rounding out The Old Guard are the 289th Military Police Company, the 947th Military Working Dog Detachment, the 529th Regimental Support Company, two battalion headquarters companies, and the regimental headquarters company.

Generally, line infantry companies delegate the escort role to their 1st platoon. This platoon is generally composed of the tallest soldiers assigned to the unit. The regiment's Presidential Escort Platoon, Honor Guard Company, is based at Fort Myer. A former member of the platoon who served in the early 2000s reported that 6 foot 5 inches was the minimum height required by the platoon at that time. The platoon serves at presidential funerals, inaugurations, Pentagon retirements, state dinners and state visits at the White House, and during presidential speeches in the Rose Garden, among other duties.

After a 31-year hiatus from service, the 2nd Battalion was reactivated on 15 March 2001 as part of the US Army's first Stryker brigade (inactive) combat team. It served as part of the first deployment of a Stryker brigade combat team in 2003. It then served a 15-month deployment in 2006‚Äì2007. It deployed to Iraq again in 2009 and Afghanistan in 2011. From 1966 to 1970, the 2nd Battalion was part of the 199th Light Infantry Brigade and 23rd Infantry Division in Vietnam. * Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC), 2nd Battalion, 3rd US Infantry Regiment ** Scout Platoon ** Mortar Platoon ** Medical Platoon ** Battalion Staff Sections: (S1, S2, S3, S4, S6) * Alpha Company ** First Platoon ** Second Platoon ** Third Platoon ** Mortar Section * Bravo Company ** First Platoon ** Second Platoon ** Third Platoon ** Mortar Section * Charlie Company ** First Platoon ** Second Platoon ** Third Platoon ** Mortar Section * Golf Company ** HQ/Field Feeding Team Platoon ** Maintenance Platoon ** Distribution Platoon =4th Battalion 3rd US Infantry Regiment= From 1966 to 1974, the 4th Battalion was part of the 11th and 198th Infantry Brigades and 23rd Infantry Division in Vietnam. The 4th Battalion was reactivated at Fort Myer in 2008.

The 1st Infantry saw its first combat in an unsuccessful campaign against the Miami tribe near modern-day Fort Wayne, Indiana in 1790. This was followed by devastating losses at St. Clair's Defeat in 1791. Artists depiction of Anthony Wayne near the banks of the Maumee River in Ohio, August 1794 In 1792 the United States Army was reorganized into the Legion of the United States, with the 1st Infantry forming the nucleus of the 1st Sub-Legion. (Sub-Legions were the remote ancestors of today's Brigade Combat Teams, with organic Infantry, Cavalry and Artillery units.) On 20 August 1794, along with the most of the Legion's units under the command of Major General Anthony Wayne, the 1st Sub-Legion was engaged at the decisive victory of the Legion over the Miamis at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. In 1795 the Legion was reorganized along more traditional lines and reverted to being called the United States Army. In the reorganization the 1st Sub-Legion was redesignated as the 1st Infantry Regiment. As of 1805, six of the regiment's ten companies were in St. Louis, Missouri, with the other four located at Fort Massac, Fort Dearborn, Fort Adams, Mississippi and Fort Wayne in Detroit. =War of 1812 and reorganization of the Army= During the War of 1812 the 1st Infantry served in Upper Canada and saw action at the battles of Chippewa and Lundy's Lane. These actions give the regiment campaign credit for the War of 1812. After the end of the War of 1812 in early 1815, the Army had a total of 44 Infantry regiments which were consolidated into only eight regiments. Rather than preserving the existing designations of the Army's oldest units, it was decided instead to consolidate units based on their geographic proximity rather than seniority. This is why the 3rd Infantry is the oldest Infantry unit in the active United States Army rather than the 1st Infantry. =1815 to 1861= As of 30 November 1819, the regiment was located on the northwestern frontier at Fort Howard in Green Bay, Wisconsin. As of 9 November 1822, the regiment had 6 companies in Green Bay, two in Sarnac and two in Chicago. The annual report of the Army from 1826 showed that the regiment had been re-located to Jefferson Barracks, Missouri. As of November 1837 the regiment's headquarters and six companies were at Fort Jesup in Louisiana with the other four companies at Fort Towson in Oklahoma. From 1840 to 1843 the 3rd Infantry fought in the Seminole War in Florida. During the Mexican War the regiment fought in most of the major battles of the war including Palo Alto, Monterey, the invasion and Siege of Vera Cruz, Cerro Gordo, Churubusco and Chapultepec which led to the capture and occupation of Mexico City. From 1856 to 1860 the regiment served in New Mexico where it fought the Navajo Indian tribe. After serving in New Mexico, the regiment was spread out to various posts on the Gulf of Mexico from Florida to Texas. =American Civil War= The 3rd Infantry saw extensive service during the American Civil War and was credited with 12 campaigns. Detachments from the regiment were serving at Fort Pickens in Florida and in Saluria on the Gulf Coast of Texas when the war began in April 1861. Three companies of the 3rd Infantry surrendered on 25 April. Five of the regiment's 10 companies were engaged at the Battle of Bull Run on 20 July 1861. The regiment spent most of the war assigned to the Army of the Potomac and served mostly in Virginia. From May 1862 to March 1864 it served with 1st Brigade, 2nd Division of the 5th Corps. In March 1864 it was reassigned to the 4th Brigade, 1st Division of the 5th Corps. It participated in the Siege of Yorktown (part of the Peninsular Campaign), the Battle of Cold Harbor, the Battle of Malvern Hill, the Second Battle of Bull Run, the Battle of Antietam, the Battle of Fredericksburg, the Battle of Chancellorsville, the Battle of Gettysburg and the Battle of Appomattox. =1865 to 1917= After the Civil War, the 3rd Infantry served in Kansas, Colorado and the Indian Territory (later the state of Oklahoma) from 1866 to 1874. It then served in Louisiana and Mississippi from 1874 to 1877 and Montana, Minnesota and South Dakota from 1877 to 1898.Circular Showing the Distribution of Troops of the Line of the United States Army. 1 January 1866, to 30 June 1909. pp. 47-48. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the regiment served in Cuba from 14 June ‚Äì 25 August 1898, where it participated in the Santiago Campaign and fought at the Battle of San Juan Hill. After returning from Cuba, the 3rd Infantry was stationed at Fort Snelling in Minnesota. On 5 October 1898, a force of about 80 men‚Äîincluding soldiers of the 3rd Infantry, U.S. Marshals and Indian Police‚Äîfought in the Battle of Sugar Point against 17 members of the local Pillager Band of Chippewa Indians near the Leech Lake Reservation. The United States forces lost 6 soldiers and one Indian Police officer killed and another 14 wounded. There were no casualties among the Chippewa. Hospital Steward (later Major) Oscar Burkard received the Medal of Honor for rescuing casualties during the battle. The Battle of Sugar Point was the last battle fought between the United States Army and Native Americans. The 3rd Infantry also served in the Philippines during the Philippine Insurrection from 3 February 1899, to 15 April 1902. It then returned to the United States where it was stationed in Kentucky, Ohio and Illinois. It was then sent to Alaska where it served from 1 July 1904, to 6 August 1906, when it was sent to Washington state until it was sent back to the Philippines about 1909. As of August 1914 the Regiment's headquarters, along with the 2nd and 3rd Battalions, were located at Madison Barracks, New York. The 1st Battalion was located at Fort Ontario, New York. =Mexican Border and World War I= In 1916 the 3rd Infantry, then commanded by Colonel Julius Penn, was sent to the Texas-Mexico Border during the Pancho Villa Expedition and guarded against a possible invasion. One of the Regiment's officers at this time was 2nd Lieutenant James Van Fleet, who graduated West Point in 1915 and would rise to four-star general during the Korean War. During World War I, the headquarters of the 3rd Infantry, along with the 3rd Battalion, was posted at Camp Eagle Pass in Texas. The 1st Battalion was located at Del Rio, Texas and the 2nd Battalion was at Fort Sam Houston. Throughout the war the regiment was assigned to patrolling the Mexican Border and did not see action. During World War I, recent West Point graduate Captain Matthew Ridgway was assigned to the 3rd Infantry. Ridgway would go on to have a highly distinguished 38-year career including assignments as commander of the 82nd Airborne Division, XVIII Airborne Corps, 8th United States Army, United Nations Command Korea, Supreme Allied Commander Europe and Chief of Staff of the United States Army. =Interwar period (1919‚Äì39)= Following the establishment of the United States Border Patrol, the 3rd Infantry was relocated to Camp Sherman in Ohio on 14 October 1920. The Regiment marched 941 miles from Camp Sherman to Fort Snelling, Minnesota, arriving on 17 November 1921. Upon arrival the 2nd and 3rd Battalions were inactivated on 18 November 1921 and the 1st Battalion assumed garrison duties. The regiment was re-organized as a combat regiment when the 2nd and 3rd Battalions were re-activated on 8 June 1922. On 24 March 1923 the regiment was assigned to the 7th Division. On 15 August 1927 the regiment was reassigned to the 6th Division. On 1 October 1933 the regiment reverted to being assigned to the 7th Division. On 22 April 1939 the regiment conducted a review for Crown Prince Frederick and Princess Ingrid of Denmark. =World War II= During World War II, the 3rd Infantry served most of the war as a separate regiment and was not assigned to a combat division until 50 days before the German surrender. On 16 October 1939 it was relieved from assignment to the 7th Division and assigned to the 6th Division at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. In November 1940 the 1st Battalion was relocated to Fort Crook, Nebraska. The regiment was relieved from assignment to the 6th Division on 10 May 1941. The 3rd Battalion departed from New York on 20 January 1941 and was sent to St. Johns, Newfoundland before moving to Fort Pepperrell in the Newfoundland Base Command in November 1941. The 1st Battalion was inactivated 1 June 1941 at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, with its soldiers being assigned to the 63rd Infantry and was re-activated 14 February 1942 in Newfoundland. The remainder of the regiment was sent to Camp Ripley, Minnesota, on 13 September 1941 and returned to Fort Snelling on 26 September. When the United States declared war on Japan in December 1941 the regiment was stationed at Fort Snelling. The 2nd Battalion was inactivated 1 September 1942 at Fort Snelling. The regiment arrived in Boston on 17 September 1943 and moved to Camp Butner, North Carolina, on 22 September 1943 where it was attached to the XII Corps. The 2nd Battalion was re-activated on 22 October 1943 at Camp Butner. The regiment was moved to Fort Benning, Georgia, on 8 March 1944, where it provided cadre for the Infantry School. Late in the war, the regiment staged at Camp Myles Standish, near Taunton, Massachusetts, on 27 February 1945, and departed from Boston bound for France on 8 March 1945. The regiment arrived in Le Havre, France on 18 March 1945, and was attached to the reconstituted 106th Infantry Division with the mission of containing the isolated German garrison at St. Nazaire. The regiment moved with the 106th Division into Germany on 26 April 1945 ‚Äî twelve days before the surrender of Germany ‚Äî and processed prisoners of war. The regiment was then assigned to duty in the occupation of Germany and was located at Babenhausen. The 3rd Infantry was inactivated on 20 November 1946 in Berlin.World War II Order of Battle. Shelby L. Stanton. Galahad Books. pg. 199. The 3rd Infantry was credited with the American Theater streamer for its defense of Newfoundland. It was also credited with the European Theater Northern France Campaign streamer, even though the Northern France Campaign technically ended on 14 September 1944. However theater commanders were authorized to award Campaign Participation Credit to select campaigns even after the technical end of that campaign, the Northern France Campaign being one of those, since the 3rd Infantry Regiment assisted with the mission of containing the German Garrison at St.Nazaire. =Post World War II= The 3rd Infantry Regiment (less the 2nd Battalion) was re-activated on 6 April 1948 at Fort Myer, Virginia. The 2nd Battalion was concurrently re-activated at Fort Lesley J. McNair, Washington, D.C. This was when the unit assumed the role it is best known for today as the official ceremonial unit of the United States Army. The regiment's reactivation was shortly before the state funeral of General of the Armies John J. Pershing held on 19 July 1948 in which soldiers of the 3rd Infantry played a prominent role. This was the beginning of the 3rd Infantry's current mission of performing ceremonial duties in the Washington, D.C. area. The Old Guard gained national attention for the support it provided to the state funeral of President John F. Kennedy in November 1963. Aside from the Kennedy funeral, the Old Guard has also supported state funerals for the Unknown Soldiers of World War II, Korea and Vietnam as well as presidents Herbert Hoover, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson, Ronald Reagan and Gerald R. Ford. Other persons who have received state funerals the Old Guard has supported included General John J. Pershing, General Douglas MacArthur, Vice President Hubert Humphrey and Medal of Honor recipient Senator Daniel Inouye. Aside from supporting military and state funerals, the 3rd Infantry also assumed the responsibility for providing the guard detail at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Arlington National Cemetery and for providing honor guards at the White House for high ranking dignitaries. =Subordinate battalions= The 3rd Battalion of the 3rd Infantry, from 1963 until its inactivation in 1994, was one of the three light infantry battalions that made up the Army Reserve's 205th Infantry Brigade (Light)(Separate), which in turn was the round-out brigade for the Regular Army's 6th Infantry Division (Light), based at Fort Richardson and Fort Wainwright, Alaska. The 205th Infantry Brigade was headquartered at Fort Snelling, Minnesota, until its inactivation. It was inactivated on 25 August 1994. The 3rd Battalion was scheduled to activate at Fort Carson as part of the 5th IBCT/4th Infantry Division. The activation was cancelled when the army froze at 45 brigades. The 5th Battalion was activated on 24 November 1967 and assigned to the 6th Infantry Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. It was relieved from assignment to the 6th Infantry Division on 24 July 1968, and inactivated on 21 July 1969 at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. The 6th Battalion was activated on 24 November 1967 and assigned to the 6th Infantry Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. It was relieved from assignment to the 6th Infantry Division on 24 July 1968, and inactivated on 1 February 1969 at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. The 7th Battalion was activated on 24 November 1967 and assigned to the 6th Infantry Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. It was relieved from assignment to the 6th Infantry Division on 24 July 1968, and inactivated on 25 July, concurrent with the inactivation of the 6th Infantry Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. =The 4th Battalion in Vietnam (1967‚Äì68)= The 4th Battalion of The Old Guard was officially activated at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, on 1 July 1966, and commanded by LTC Harold J. Meyer. The battalion consisted initially of Headquarters and Headquarters Company and A Company, containing one officer/five enlisted men and twenty one enlisted men respectively. By 31 December 1966, the battalion strength had increased to 37 officers, two warrant officers and 492 enlisted men. When the battalion was reactivated, it utilized facilities formerly occupied by elements of the 25th infantry Division. During the period of 1 July 1966 through 10 September 1966 the battalion conducted preparation for Basic Unit Training since most of the Old Guard's lower enlisted personnel had never served with a regular unit. The non-commissioned officers, on the other hand, were greatly experienced with many recent returns from Vietnam. During its preparation for service in South Vietnam, the 4th Battalion was assigned to the 11th Infantry Brigade. On 15 August 1967 the 11th Infantry Brigade adopted the \\"light Infantry\\" concept. By selecting one rifle platoon and personnel from the weapons platoon from each line company, an additional line company, delta, was introduced to the battalion. Further by removing the 4.2\\" mortar and reconnaissance platoons and the ground surveillance section from the former headquarters company, a combat support company, Echo, was created with these two changes to the battalion, the revised strength authorization totaled 44 officers, 1 warrant officer and 886 enlisted men. On 7 July 1967 the battalion conducted a farewell review for its departing commander, Lieutenant Colonel Meyer and simultaneously Major C. Hartsfield assumed interim command of the battalion. On 20 July, the battalion welcomed Lieutenant Colonel Alvin E. Adkins as its new commander. Adkins had previously served in World War II, the Korean and Vietnam Wars. On 25 December personnel of the advance party, including LTC Adkins, the company commanders and additional key staff members departed by aircraft for South Vietnam. Shortly thereafter at 23:30 on 5 December the main body left Honolulu pier 40 on the . After 14 days at sea, the main body arrived at Qui Nhon harbor and proceeded by vehicle convoy north along Highway 1 to ƒê·ª©c Ph·ªï Base Camp and a base of operations known as Carentan. In-country training and combat operations commenced immediately, throughout the remainder of 1967 the battalion conducted search and destroy (since relabeled \\"sweep and clear\\", an important distinction when handling possibly unfriendly local non-combatants) missions outside Carentan and to the west of ƒê·ª©c Ph·ªï, sustaining light casualties and grasping a firm hold on the combat situation. Here Delta Company recorded the brigade's first Purple Heart recipient SP/4 Bobby L. Godwin, who was wounded in the leg while on patrol. Other medal recipients in 1967: * Major Roy Holck ‚Äì Bronze Star; * Specialist 5 Robert Olsen ‚Äì Air Medal; * Sergeant Frank Villigas ‚Äì Bronze Star; * Sergeant Phillip Bridges- Bronze Star; * Second Lieutenant Kendrick- Silver Star; * Sergeant Maddox- Bronze Star / V device (posthumously') 1 January 68 to 1 June 1968 The following is a generalized summary of the activities of the battalion and related companies: HHC: * 26 January, PFC James Schliebner (Medic) wounded during mine explosion * SSG Jose Alvarez Sanchez (battalion Mess) Wounded mortar attack * 12 February, SP/4 Maurice Lee (medic) Silver Star On 11 March atop LZ Sue, a fire broke out in one of the mortar platoons ammunition bunkers. An imminent disaster was averted by the quick reaction and leadership on the part of the officers and non-commissioned officers in the vicinity, Major Howard Hartsfield, battalion executive officer and Captain John McAnaw, S-3 Air, were recommended for the Soldier's Medal and Bronze Star respectively, for their part in preventing the destruction of the fire base and all its personnel.

Another historic event occurred on 15 December 2003, when Bravo Company of the 1st Battalion deployed from Fort Myer, Virginia, for duty in the US Central Command area of operations. This was the first deployment of an element of The Old Guard's 1st Battalion since World War II. Bravo Company, also called Task Force Bravo and Team Battlehard, arrived in the US Central Command area of operations to take up duty in Djibouti on the Horn of Africa on 17 December 2003. The soldiers of The Old Guard served in support of Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) and Operation Enduring Freedom. Based at Camp Lemonnier, their missions in the region included force protection to civil affairs and engineer personnel, engaging in joint operations with other US and regional military forces and constant training to stay prepared. Team Battlehard redeployed back to Ft. Myer in July 2004. In 2007, 1st Battalion's Delta Company was deployed to Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti as part of CJTF-HOA, supporting humanitarian missions and local military training in the region.Van Der Weide, Nancy.

The band was formed in Seattle under the name Smoosh in 2000 and adopted their current name in 2012. The band consists of two sisters, who founded the band as children: singer/keyboardist Asya \\"Asy\\" Saavedra (born February 2, 1992) and drummer Chloe Saavedra (born March 5, 1994). They released three LPs as Smoosh, and have produced two further EPs, several singles, and a fourth full- length album as Chaos Chaos. History =Smoosh: 2000‚Äì2012= Smoosh started in 2000 when the family was at a Seattle music store The Trading Musician, standing in line to restring a violin. Asy and Chloe wandered into the drum section of the store, where Chloe met Jason McGerr, the drummer for Death Cab for Cutie. The family eventually left with a $600 drum kit for Chloe, McGerr's card from the Seattle Drum School, \\"and no violin.\\"Smoosh , Pattern 25 Records. Accessed 16 November 2006. When McGerr learned that Asy had been playing the piano and writing songs since she was very young, he offered to help them both. Neither Asy nor Chloe read music.Alexander Lauence, An Interview with Indie Sensation, Smoosh, Free Williamsburg, February 18, 2005. Accessed 11 December 2006. Asy began piano training but soon quit because she found it boring. In 2000, Smoosh released Tomato Mistakes, a two- track single that they mailed free of charge to anyone who wanted it. Four years later, in September 2004, Smoosh's full-length debut She Like Electric was released under Pattern 25 Records. By the time Smoosh released their second LP, on June 6, 2006, titled Free to Stay, they were signed to Seattle- based indie label Barsuk Records. Its third and title track, \\"Free to Stay\\", was an early song featured on Tomato Mistakes. Asy also plays guitar on the track 'Waiting for Something' off Free to Stay. The second album also features the song \\"Find A Way\\" which Smoosh performed on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on July 12, 2006, marking their first performance on late night TV.

Earlier that year, they also performed a headlining spring tour on the east coast with The Postmarks. The band played \\"Pajama Party Time\\" on Zoom episode 20 of Season 4, originally broadcast in 2002, and again in episode 5 of season 1 of Yo Gabba Gabba in 2007.

The term was coined in the 1940s to describe corrupt labor contracts that were favorable to the employer rather than the workers, and usually involved some kind of kickback or special treatment for the labor negotiator. The term is also applied to special arrangements between private corporations and government entities, whereby the corporation and sometimes a government official reap the benefits, rather than the public. No-bid contracts may be awarded to people who have political connections or make donations to influential politicians. Sometimes a sweetheart deal involves tax breaks or other inducements to get a corporation to do business in that city or state. A \\"sweetheart settlement\\" may also occur in a legal context. For example, in a class-action lawsuit the attorneys representing a class of plaintiffs may reach an agreement with the defendant in which the primary result is a lucrative fee for the attorneys rather than maximum compensation for the class members.

When not mineralized, the presence of debris is known as chronic caseous tonsillitis (CCT). Symptoms may include bad breath. Generally there is no pain, though there may be the feeling of something present. Risk factors may include recurrent throat infections. Tonsil stones contain a biofilm composed of a number of different bacteria. While they most commonly occur in the palatine tonsils, they may also occur in the lingual tonsils. Tonsil stones have been recorded weighing from 0.3g to 42g. They may be found during medical imaging for other reasons. If tonsil stones do not bother a person, no treatment is needed. Otherwise gargling salt water and manual removal may be tried. Chlorhexidine may also be tried. Surgical treatment may include partial or complete tonsil removal. Up to 10% of people have tonsil stones. Males and females are affected equally. Older people are more commonly affected. Signs and symptoms Tonsil stones may produce no symptoms or they may be associated with bad breath. The smell may be that of rotting eggs. Occasionally there may be pain when swallowing. Even when they are large, some tonsil stones are only discovered incidentally on X-rays or CAT scans. Other symptoms include a metallic taste, throat closing or tightening, coughing fits, and choking. Larger tonsil stones may cause recurrent bad breath, which frequently accompanies a tonsil infection, sore throat, white debris, a bad taste in the back of the throat, difficulty swallowing, ear ache, and tonsil swelling. A medical study conducted in 2007 found an association between tonsilloliths and bad breath in patients with a certain type of recurrent tonsillitis. Among those with bad breath, 75% of the subjects had tonsilloliths, while only 6% of subjects with normal halitometry values (normal breath) had tonsilloliths. A foreign body sensation may also exist in the back of the throat. The condition may also be an asymptomatic condition, with detection upon palpating a hard intratonsillar or submucosal mass. File:Tonsilstone.jpgA tonsillolith protrudes from the tonsil File:Tonsilloliths 20091119 prior to tonsillectomy.JPGLarge tonsillolith half exposed on tonsil File:Tonsillolith close up.jpg Closeup of a tonsillolith  Pathophysiology  Low-power microscope magnification of a cross-section through one of the tonsillar crypts (running diagonally) as it opens onto the surface of the throat (at the top). Stratified epithelium (e) covers the throat's surface and continues as a lining of the crypt. Beneath the surface are numerous nodules (f) of lymphoid tissue. Many lymph cells (dark-colored region) pass from the nodules toward the surface and will eventually mix with the saliva as salivary corpuscles (s). The mechanism by which these calculi form is subject to debate, though they appear to result from the accumulation of material retained within the crypts, along with the growth of bacteria and fungi ‚Äì sometimes in association with persistent chronic purulent tonsillitis. In 2009, an association between biofilms and tonsilloliths was shown. Central to the biofilm concept is the assumption that bacteria form a three dimensional structure, dormant bacteria being in the center to serve as a constant nidus of infection. This impermeable structure renders the biofilm immune to antibiotic treatment. By use of confocal microscopy and microelectrodes, biofilms similar to dental biofilms were shown to be present in the tonsillolith, with oxygen respiration at the outer layer of tonsillolith, denitrification toward the middle, and acidification toward the bottom. Diagnosis CT scan of tonsilloliths. Diagnosis is usually made upon inspection. Tonsilloliths are difficult to diagnose in the absence of clear manifestations, and often constitute casual findings of routine radiological studies. =Classification= Tonsilloliths or tonsil stones are calcifications that form in the crypts of the palatal tonsils. They are also known to form in the throat and on the roof of the mouth. Tonsils are filled with crevices where bacteria and other materials, including dead cells and mucus, can become trapped. When this occurs, the debris can become concentrated in white formations that occur in the pockets. Tonsilloliths are formed when this trapped debris accumulates and are expressed from the tonsil. They are generally soft, sometimes rubbery. This tends to occur most often in people who suffer from chronic inflammation in their tonsils or repeated bouts of tonsillitis. They are often associated with post-nasal drip. =Giant= Much rarer than the typical tonsil stones are giant tonsilloliths. Giant tonsilloliths may often be mistaken for other oral maladies, including peritonsillar abscess, and tumours of the tonsil. =Differential diagnosis= Imaging diagnostic techniques can identify a radiopaque mass that may be mistaken for foreign bodies, displaced teeth or calcified blood vessels. CT scan may reveal nonspecific calcified images in the tonsillar zone. The differential diagnosis must be established with acute and chronic tonsillitis, tonsillar hypertrophy, peritonsillar abscesses, foreign bodies, phlebolites, ectopic bone or cartilage, lymph nodes, granulomatous lesions or calcification of the stylohyoid ligament in the context of Eagle syndrome (elongated styloid process). Differential diagnosis of tonsilloliths includes foreign body, calcified granuloma, malignancy, an enlarged temporal styloid process or rarely, isolated bone which is usually derived from embryonic rests originating from the branchial arches.Images Treatment If tonsil stones do not bother a person, no treatment is needed. Otherwise gargling saltwater and manual removal may be tried. Chlorhexidine may also be tried. Surgical treatment may include partial or complete tonsil removal. Some people are able to remove tonsil stones using a cotton swab or finger. Oral irrigators are also effective. Most electric oral irrigators are unsuitable for tonsil stone removal because they are too powerful and are likely to cause discomfort and rupture the tonsils, which could result in further complications such as infection. Irrigators that connect directly to the sink tap via a threaded attachment or otherwise are suitable for tonsil stone removal and everyday washing of the tonsils because they can jet water at low-pressure levels that the user can adjust by simply turning the sink tap, allowing for a continuous range of pressures to suit each user's requirements. Or, there is a tonsil stone remover in the manual pump system. Manual pump-type tonsil stone remover can adjust the water pressure depending on the number of pumps, effectively removing tonsil stones. More simply still, gargling with warm, salty water may help alleviate the discomfort of tonsillitis, which often accompanies tonsil stones. Vigorous gargling each morning can also keep the tonsil crypts clear of all but the most persistent tonsilloliths. =Curettage= Larger tonsil stones may require removal by curettage (scooping) or otherwise, although thorough irrigation will still be required afterward to effectively wash out smaller pieces. Larger lesions may require local excision, although these treatments may not completely help the bad breath issues that are often associated with this condition. =Laser= Another option is to decrease the surface area (crypts, crevices, etc.) of the tonsils via laser resurfacing. The procedure is called a laser cryptolysis. It can be performed using a local anesthetic. A scanned carbon dioxide laser selectively vaporizes and smooths the surface of the tonsils. This technique flattens the edges of the crypts and crevices that collect the debris, preventing trapped material from forming stones. =Surgery= Tonsillectomy may be indicated if bad breath due to tonsillar stones persists despite other measures. Epidemiology Tonsilloliths or tonsillar concretions occur in up to 10% of the population, frequently due to episodes of tonsillitis. While small concretions in the tonsils are common, true stones are less so. They commonly occur in young adults and are rare in children.

Archive.org ‚Äì 23 September 1849) was the founder of the Hibbert Trust. Biography The third and posthumous son of John Hibbert (1732‚Äì1769), a Jamaica merchant, and Janet, daughter of Samuel Gordon, he was born in Jamaica; hence he spoke of himself as a Creole. His mother died early. Between 1784 and 1788, he was a pupil of Gilbert Wakefield at Nottingham. He entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in 1788, and graduated B.A. in 1791. At Cambridge he formed a lifelong friendship with William Frend, the social reformer. At a later period (1800‚Äì01), when Wakefield was imprisoned in Dorchester for writing a political pamphlet, Hibbert, though not wealthy then, sent him ¬£1,000. In 1791, Hibbert went to Kingston, Jamaica, as partner in a mercantile house (a trading partnership, Hibbert, Purrier and Horton) founded by his cousin Thomas (not to be confused with his father's eldest brother, Thomas Hibbert). Another cousin, George Hibbert, son of another Robert Hibbert (1717-1784) was one of the principals of the West India Dock Company which instigated the construction of the docks of that name on London's Isle of Dogs. Returning to England in about 1803, he bought the estate of East Hide (now called Hyde), near Luton, Bedfordshire. In Jamaica, he had acquired considerable property (in 1791 he purchased two sugar plantations, Georgia and Dundee, both in Hanover Parish) and he was not convinced by the arguments of Frend that his ownership of slaves was immoral. Besides plans for their material benefit, he sent out as a missionary to the negroes on his estates, in October 1817, Thomas Cooper (died 25 October 1880, aged 88). Cooper, a Unitarian minister recommended by Frend, remained on the island until 1821, endeavouring, with little success, to improve their moral and religious condition. A somewhat acrimonious controversy followed the publication of Cooper's report. After 1825, Hibbert's Jamaica property declined in value and in about 1836 he sold it at considerable loss. He had previously (1833) sold his Bedfordshire estate and moved to London. He died at Welbeck Street, London, on 23 September 1849, and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery. While in Jamaica, he married Elizabeth Jane, daughter of John Nembhard, M.D., who died on 15 February 1853. =Hibbert Trust= On 19 July 1847, Hibbert executed a deed conveying to trustees $50,000 in 6% Ohio stock, and ¬£8,000 in railway shares. The trustees, on the death of his widow, were to apply the income 'in such manner as they shall from time to time deem most conducive to the spread of Christianity in its most simple and intelligible form, and to the unfettered exercise of the right of private judgment in matters of religion'. The trustees were always to be laymen. Appended was a scheme for the administration of the trust, which the trustees were empowered to revise, and were directed to revise at least once in every twenty-five years. In the original scheme the trust was called 'the Anti-trinitarian Fund', and its object was, by a provision of divinity scholarships, to encourage learning and culture among unorthodox Christians. The breadth of the actual trust is largely due to the counsels of Hibbert's solicitor, Edwin Wilkins Field, but, in opposition to Field, Hibbert 'determined on insisting that all recipients should be hetero-dox', his intention being 'to elevate the position and the public influence of the unitarian ministry'. In addition to scholarships and fellowships, the number and conditions of which are settled by the trustees from year to year, the trust, from the revision of 1878 until 1887, maintained an annual Hibbert Lecture, the first series being delivered by Professor Max Muller in 1878; between 1902 and 1968 it issued The Hibbert Journal, a quarterly magazine.

Included in the photograph are William Ewart Gladstone and his wife Catherine and daughter Mary, as well as the Earl of Rosebery (seated at front, facing right) and his Countess and the Countess's cousin Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild. The Midlothian campaign of 1878‚Äì80 was a series of foreign policy speeches given by William Ewart Gladstone, leader of Britain's Liberal Party. It is often cited as the first modern political campaign. It also set the stage for Gladstone's comeback as a politician. It takes its name from the Midlothian constituency in Scotland where Gladstone (of Scottish ancestry) successfully stood in the 1880 election. When Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli attempted to distract public opinion from the economic and financial problems of Britain by calling attention to the worsening British-Ottoman relations, Gladstone in four speeches charged the government with financial incompetence, neglect of domestic legislation, and mismanagement of foreign affairs. The Midlothian campaign unified the Liberal Party under Gladstone's leadership and probably forced the government to think in terms of dissolution sooner. It created a momentum that carried the Liberals to power in the election.David Brooks, \\"Gladstone and Midlothian: The Background to the First Campaign,\\" Scottish Historical Review (1985) 64#1 pp 42-67 Background In 1876, news of a series of atrocities by the Ottomans during their suppression of the Bulgarian April Uprising reached the British press, despite the strong censorship of the Turkish authorities. British public reaction was generally one of dismay, fuelled by the public prints, but the government of Benjamin Disraeli continued its policy of support for the Ottoman Empire, an ally in the Crimean War and a bulwark against possible Russian expansion in the area. Gladstone took up the issue slowly, at first appearing uninterested. By 1878 he was publishing articles in favour of ending British economic support for the Ottoman government in response. The campaign By 1880, Gladstone's dogged focus on the issue had dragged it to the forefront of public attention, and in the general election of 1880, Gladstone toured a series of cities giving speeches of up to five hours on the subject. The nature of his orations has often been compared to that of sermons, and his fiery, emotive, but logically structured speeches are credited with swaying a large number of undecided voters to the Liberals in the 1880s, and ousting Disraeli's last Conservative government. Equally important to the large scale of attendance at these meetings (several thousand came to each, and given the relatively narrow scale of the franchise, this meant Gladstone could address a large proportion of electors in each district) was the widespread reporting of Gladstone's speeches and the public reaction to them. Paul Brighton argues that it was a highly successful media event: :What was new about Midlothian was not that Gladstone spoke from the platform. This was already common-place for many front-rank politicians. It was the fact that the campaign was effectively designed as a media event, with specific attention to the deadlines and operational requirements of the journalists covering it and crafted for maximum impact in the morning and evening papers. Content Gladstone's speeches covered the entire range of national policy, he gave his large audiences an advanced course in the principles of government that was both magisterial and exciting. The major speeches constitute a statement of the Liberal philosophy of government, reinforced by the fervour of his own deeply- held Anglican faith. Scotland, at this time, was a nation fixated on the promotion this sort of religious and moral rectitude and probity. His focus was usually on foreign affairs. Gladstone presented his commitment to a world community, governed by law, protecting the weak. His vision of the ideal world order combined universalism and inclusiveness; he appealed to group feeling, the sense of concern for others, rising eventually to the larger picture of the unity of mankind.Robert Kelley, \\"Midlothian: A Study In Politics and Ideas,\\" Victorian Studies (1960) 4#2 pp 119-140.

Upon its entry to the air-breathing world, the newborn must begin to adjust to life outside the uterus. The outside environment is a drastic change for the neonate, therefore the neonate must be assessed frequently and thoroughly. The apgar scale is an assessment performed immediately following birth. It consists of the assessment of heart rate, respiratory effort, muscle tone, reflex irritability, and generalized skin color. Apgar scoring is performed one minute and five minutes after birth. Scoring ranges from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating severe neonatal distress and 10 indicating a smooth transition to extrauterine life. Newborns transitioning into extrauterine life will undergo periods of reactivity. These periods are divided into three stages. The first stage occurs in the first 30 minutes of life; during this stage the infant is alert and responsive with heart rate peaking at 160-180 beats per minute and then stabilizes to a baseline rate of 100-120 beats per minute. Crackles upon auscultation and irregular respirations are a normal finding. In the second stage, there is a decrease in responsiveness and motor activity which is often manifested as sleep. This period can last from 1-2 hours. The third stage marks the second period of reactivity. This period can occur anywhere in the first 2 to 8 hours after birth and lasts anywhere from 10 minutes to several hours. Tachycardia and tachypnea may be present during brief periods. Passing of meconium also occurs. Cardiac Physiology: In utero, the placenta delivers oxygenated blood to the fetus through the umbilical vein. Upon delivery, the umbilical cord is cut. The cardiovascular system must now adapt. The detachment of the placenta causes an increase in systemic vascular resistance, which leads to an increase in pressure gradient from the left atrium. The left atrium now has higher pressure than the right atrium causing the foramen ovale to close. Within the first 10 minutes of birth, blood begins to flow left-to-right through the ductus arteriosus. This causes a significant increase in output of the left ventricle and increase in stroke volume. Subsequently, calcium channel activity increases and potassium channel decreases furthering ductal constriction. Functional closure of the ductus arteriosus occurs within the first 24 hours, with permanent closure following within 4 weeks. Lastly cardiac output increases to nearly double what it was in utero. All of these cardiovascular system changes result in the adaptation from fetal circulation patterns to an adult circulation pattern. During this transition, some types of congenital heart disease that were not symptomatic in utero during fetal circulation will present with cyanosis or respiratory signs. Changing the composition of hemoglobin before and after birth. Also identifies the types of cells and organs in which the gene expression (data on Wood W.G., (1976). Br. Med. Bull. 32, 282.) Manifestations: When the newborn cries, there is a reversal of blood flow through the foramen ovale which causes the newborn to appear mildly cyanotic in the first few days of life. The heart rate of the newborn should be between 110-160 beats per minute and it is common for the heart rate to be irregular in the first few hours following birth. The heart sounds will have a variation in pitch, duration, and intensity than that of an adult. Blood pressure readings should range from 60 to 80 mm Hg systolic and 40-50 mm Hg diastolic. Mean arterial pressure should be the same as the weeks of gestation at birth. Within the first hour after birth, there may be a drop of up to 15 mm Hg in the systolic blood pressure. Delayed cord clamping is defined as waiting more than 2 minutes to clamp the newborn‚Äôs umbilical cord. This has been proven to be beneficial in improving hematocrit and iron while also decreasing anemia. These benefits can last up to 6 months for the newborn. Assessments/Interventions: Assessment and monitoring of vital signs and skin color are important in detecting cardiovascular issues in the infant. The apical pulse rate should be auscultated for one full minute when the newborn is calm or sleeping. Any irregular heart rate after the first few hours of life that is not related to crying or another outside factor should be monitored and evaluated. Blood pressure will be taken with an appropriately sized cuff, preferably when the newborn is at rest. Consistent tachycardia should be evaluated for conditions such as anemia, hyperthermia, hypovolemia, and sepsis. Consistent bradycardia could be an indication of congenital heart block or hypoxemia. Pallor and central cyanosis (cyanosis in hands and feet is a common and normal finding) can also indicate cardiovascular issues. Ventilation and Oxygenation Physiology: Upon birth, the newborn's lungs become the center for gas exchange. There are a variety of factors that influence newborn respiratory functions; these factors include chemical, mechanical, thermal, and sensory. Respirations begin when fetal aortic and carotid chemoreceptors are stimulated by the varying concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide. During vaginal birth, the newborn's chest is compressed by the birth canal. Upon delivery, negative pressure allows air into the lungs. The first cries of the infant allow for alveoli expansion and absorption of fetal lung fluid. Temperature changes and other sensory stimulation contributes to respiratory function as well. Manifestations: Breathing patterns are often irregular and shallow. The infants respiration rate should be between 30-60 breaths per minute with preference for nasal breathing. Ribs expands horizontally. Breath sounds should be clear and equal in both lungs. Abdominal breathing is normal. Acrocyanosis is a normal finding. Assessments/Interventions: Suctioning of nasal and oral secretions promotes fluid clearance. Auscultation of lung sounds to assess for any abnormalities. Pulse oximetry is performed to determine oxygen saturation. Monitor signs of respiratory distress such as: nasal flaring, grunting, central cyanosis. Metabolic Physiology: At birth, the newborn is cut off from the mother‚Äôs glucose supply and will begin to rely on stored fat for energy. Glycogen stores are maximal at term. Within the first hour of life, blood glucose will typically reach its lowest point and then stabilize within 2 to 4 hours, hence breastfeeding is promoted immediately. In cases where feeding is delayed, the neonate can use lactate, free-fatty acids, and ketone bodies. Manifestations: Normal blood glucose levels range from 40-50mg/dl. Rooting and sucking reflex should be present and the neonate will eat small amounts frequently. All vital signs should be within normal limits coinciding with the neonates presentation of calmness and satiation. Assessments/Interventions: Monitor blood glucose level and encourage breastfeeding or formula feeding as early as possible. Lactation and breastfeeding education should be provided as appropriate. Temperature regulation Physiology: Newborns lack the ability of thermogenesis due to underdeveloped shivering mechanism. Body heat is lost through conduction, convection, and radiant heat. Thermoregulation is achieved through several methods: the metabolism of brown fat and Kangaroo care, also known as skin to skin. \\"Brown fat\\" is specialized adipose tissue with a high concentration of mitochondria designed to rapidly oxidize fatty acids in order to generate metabolic heat. Skin to skin to care is the immediate placement of the neonate directly onto a caregiver's bare chest. This promotes thermoregulation of the neonate through heat generated from caregiver. Manifestations: Normal temperature ranges between 97.7¬∞ and 100.0¬∞ Fahrenheit (36.5¬∞ to 37.78¬∞ Celsius). Cold infants may cry or appear restless. The neonates' arms and legs maintain a fetal position, lessening their body surface area and reducing heat loss. Assessments/Interventions: Dry neonate immediately after birth and initiate skin-to-skin contact. Provide warm blankets and a hat. Utilize a radiant warmer if skin-to-skin is not appropriate. Frequently monitor axillary body temperature. Limit neonate‚Äôs exposure during diaper changes and assessments.

Biography Johnston was born in Kentucky and was appointed from that state as a United States Navy Midshipman in 1832. He achieved the rank of Lieutenant in 1843 and had not received further promotion when he resigned from the service in April 1861. Johnston joined the Confederate States Navy in the same month as a First Lieutenant and was promoted to Commander in June 1864. His initial Confederate service was as a lighthouse inspector. He was assigned to the New Orleans Station in 1861 and to the forces on Mobile Bay, Alabama, later in that year. Johnston commanded the ironclads CSS Baltic in 1861-63 and CSS Tennessee in 1864. He was captured with the latter ship during the Battle of Mobile Bay on August 5, 1864, and held as a prisoner of war until the following October. After he was exchanged, Commander Johnston returned to duty in the Mobile area, remaining there until the end of the U.S. Civil War in May 1865, when he surrendered and was paroled. On the 9th of May 1896, he died in Savannah, Georgia and was laid to rest in Cedar Grove Cemetery, Norfolk, Virginia.

It is caused by retained fetal lung fluid due to impaired clearance mechanisms. It is the most common cause of respiratory distress in term neonates. It consists of a period of rapid breathing (higher than the normal range of 30-60 times per minute). Usually, this condition resolves over 24‚Äì72 hours. Treatment is supportive and may include supplemental oxygen and antibiotics. The chest x-ray shows hyperinflation of the lungs including prominent pulmonary vascular markings, flattening of the diaphragm, and fluid in the horizontal fissure of the right lung. Pathophysiology Due to the higher incidence of transient tachypnea of the newborn in infants delivered by caesarean section, it has been postulated that it could result from a delayed absorption of fetal lung fluid from the pulmonary lymphatic system. The increased fluid in the lungs leads to increased airway resistance and reduced lung compliance. It is thought this could be from lower levels of circulating catecholamines after a caesarean section, which are believed to be necessary to alter the function of the ENaC channel to absorb excess fluid from the lungs. Pulmonary immaturity has also been proposed as a causative factor. Levels of phosphatidylglycerol (an indicator of lung maturity) were found to be negative in certain newborns Mild surfactant deficiency has also been suggested as a causative factor. Diagnosis Transient tachypnea of the newborn is a diagnosis of exclusion as it is a benign condition that can have symptoms and signs similar to more serious conditions, such as respiratory distress syndrome. A chest X-ray may show a radiopaque line - fluid - in the horizontal fissure of the right lung, fluid infiltrate throughout alveoli or fluid in individual lung lobes. The lungs may also appear hyperinflated.  Treatment  Supportive care is the treatment of choice for transient tachypnea of the newborn. This may include withholding oral feeding in periods of extreme tachypnea (over 60 breaths per minute) to prevent aspiration, supplemental oxygen, and CPAP. Evidence from clinical trials investigating the use of postnatal corticosteroids for transient tachypnea of the newborn is inconclusive.  Epidemiology  Transient tachypnea of the newborn occurs in approximately 1 in 100 preterm infants and 3.6-5.7 per 1000 term infants.

It is a two-dimensional side- scrolling platform game. Its working titles were \\"The Adventures of Zonk\\" and \\"Cosmo Kid from Space\\", but Stephen Hornback ultimately gave it the final name. The game was released in mid March 1992 on the DOS platform.Apogee Software December 1991 Catalog Implementation Typical gameplay shot Cosmo features 16-color EGA graphics at 320√ó200 screen resolution. Although the game had superior graphics capabilities in the form of three-layer masked horizontal parallax scrolling, this feature came at the cost of the game's frame rate, moving the graphics in increments of 8 pixels (the size of one game tile) instead of 1 pixel. A file contained with the shareware version of the game urged people not to download it if their computers could not handle it. The game was written with 24,500 lines of code. =Music and sound= While the game supports AdLib music, it does not support SoundBlaster sound. The sound effects are instead generated by the PC speaker. One can cycle through all the sound effects in the game through the sound test option in the main menu. Plot The storyline is about a little alien boy named \\"Cosmo\\". Cosmo's parents are taking him to Disney World for his birthday. A comet hits their ship, forcing them to land on an unknown planet (called Zonk in WIP) and repair the ship. Cosmo goes exploring, and when he returns, his parents are missing. Seeing large footprints, Cosmo thinks that his parents have been captured and sets off to rescue them before they are eaten. There are 3 episodes in the game series in which Cosmo must navigate through 10 alien- themed levels for each episode. At the end of the first episode, Cosmo unexpectedly gets swallowed by a large creature. The story continues in the second episode, where Cosmo ends up in the creature's body and has to find a way out. At the end of the second episode, Cosmo finds the city where he thinks his parents might have been taken. In the final episode, Cosmo finds his parents (who were in no danger of being eaten the whole time) and has a great time at Disney World for his birthday. Gameplay The player controls Cosmo, and the objective is to reach the exit of each level. Cosmo can walk and jump, and can hang onto most walls with his suction-cup hands. Combining the hanging and jumps allows Cosmo to climb to higher places. There are some interactive objects, including pushable ceiling buttons, teleporters, and springs that make Cosmo jump higher. There are also hovercrafts (floating pads that allow Cosmo to fly) and hint globes (which cause a message to be displayed if Cosmo runs into one; destroying one with a bomb earns 12,800 points). The player has access to bonus levels after each level if enough stars are collected. Cosmo has a health meter with three units. Each time an enemy or hazard damages Cosmo, he loses one unit of health. If he takes further damage after losing all health units, or falls off a chasm, the player restarts the level. Cosmo has unlimited lives. There are power-up modules that restore one health unit each. There are also two hidden cheeseburgers in each episode. Picking one up earns Cosmo an additional empty health unit, allowing Cosmo's health meter to reach a maximum of five units. Enemies hurt Cosmo by touching him or firing projectiles at him. Cosmo can kill many of them by jumping on them. Bombs can also be collected and used to destroy enemies. Cosmo can carry at most 9 bombs at a time. After Cosmo drops a bomb, it takes a few seconds to explode, and it can hurt Cosmo if he is too close. Bombs can also be used to destroy other objects and hazards. Shield cubes, once collected, provide a temporary invincibility shield for Cosmo. Reception Computer Gaming World stated that Cosmo's Cosmic Adventure was \\"especially playable and extremely addicting\\", and that fans of Commander Keen and side- scrolling platform games \\"will find Cosmo much to their liking ... hours of pleasure without excessive destruction\\". The game was reviewed in 1993 in Dragon #197 by Sandy Petersen in the first \\"Eye of the Monitor\\" column. Petersen gave the game 2 out of 5 stars.

Career =College= An outstanding youth soccer player, Quill was offered a contract by Ajax Amsterdam as a teenager, but declined the opportunity to go to Europe. He instead stayed in the United States, following the conventional route by going to Clemson University to play college soccer in 1996. After scoring six goals and five assists as a freshman for the Tigers, however, Quill decided to go pro, signing a Project-40 contract with MLS. =Professional= Quill was allocated to the Tampa Bay Mutiny for the 1997 season, but saw little playing time. After appearing extensively as a substitute in 1999, Quill finally broke into the team's starting lineup in 2000, when he started 25 games, registering five goals and eleven assists. Quill returned and played just as well in 2001, finishing the year with two goals and eight assists in 23 starts. The Mutiny were contracted at the end of 2001, however, and Quill was selected fourth overall by the Kansas City Wizards in the 2002 MLS Dispersal Draft. Quill immediately stepped into the Wizards' left midfield position, but numerous injuries limited him to 13 starts and one assist on the season. Having recovered in 2003, Quill had a solid campaign, starting 25 games and scoring three goals and seven assists. However, Quill was traded in the offseason to the Dallas Burn along with Carey Talley for Shavar Thomas. Quill had a disappointing season with the Burn, and although he beat out Brad Davis for his left midfield position, he only registered one goal and three assists on the year. He was let go by the club early in 2005 and signed with the MetroStars in August. Quill was released by the club in November 2005. Unable to find a club, Quill turned to coaching, spending time as the assistant coach and recruiting coordinator with the women's soccer team at the University of Houston in 2007 and 2008. In early 2009, Quill was coaxed out of semi- retirement to play in the Premier Development League for Houston Leones, where he was expected to lend his experience to the team's midfield.Houston Leones roster =International= Although he has been called up to camps, Quill has never played for the United States national team. He has, however, played for the U-23, U-20, and U-16 sides.

The movie stars Robert Mitchum and Curt J√ºrgens as the American and German commanding officers, respectively, and was directed and produced by Dick Powell. The film was based on a novel by Denys Rayner, a British naval officer involved in anti-submarine warfare throughout the Battle of the Atlantic. For the audible effects, Walter Rossi received the 1958 Academy Award for Best Special Effects. Plot The American USS Haynes detects and attacks a German U-boat that is on its way to rendezvous with a German merchant raider in the South Atlantic Ocean. Lieutenant Commander Murrell (Robert Mitchum), a former officer in the merchant marine now an active duty officer in the Naval Reserve, has recently taken command of Haynes, even though he is still recovering from injuries incurred in the sinking of his previous ship. Before the U-boat is first spotted, one sailor questions the new captain's fitness and ability. However, as the battle begins, Murrell shows himself to be a match for wily U-boat Kapit√§n zur See von Stolberg (Curd J√ºrgens), a man who is not enamored with the Nazi regime, in a prolonged and deadly battle of wits that tests both men and their crews. Each man grows to respect his opponent. Murrell skillfully stalks the U-boat and subjects von Stolberg and his crew to hourly depth charge attacks. In the end, von Stolberg takes advantage of Murrell's too-predictable pattern of attacks and succeeds in torpedoing the destroyer escort. Although the Haynes is fatally wounded and sinking, it is still battle capable, and Murrell has one last trick up his sleeve. He orders his men to set fires on the deck to make the ship look more damaged than it actually is. Then he orders the majority of his crew to evacuate in the lifeboats, but retains a skeleton crew to man the bridge, engine room, and one of his ship's guns. As Murrell had hoped, von Stolberg decides to surface before firing his torpedos, keeping the deck gun trained on the ship. Murrell orders his gun crew to fire first at the U-boat's stern to immobilize it, and then at the deck gun. Murrell orders his executive officer, Lieutenant Ware (Al Hedison), to ram the U-boat. With his boat sinking, von Stolberg orders his crew to set scuttling charges and abandon ship. Murrell, the last man aboard, is about to join his crew in the lifeboats when he spots von Stolberg standing on the conning tower of the sinking U-boat with his injured executive officer, Oberleutnant zur See Heini Schwaffer (Theodore Bikel). Murrell tosses a line to the submarine and rescues the pair. It is clear that Schwaffer is dying, but von Stolberg refuses to leave his friend behind. Ware returns with American and German sailors in the captain's gig to take the three men off before the U-boat's scuttling charges detonate. Later, aboard another American ship, the German crew consigns Schwaffer's remains to the deep in a traditional ceremony, as the American crew respectfully watches.  Changes from the book  The movie script differs substantially from the original book. The ship is changed from British to American. More important, the final scenes of mutual respect between the protagonists is not how the book ends. In the book the destroyer captain takes a swing at the U-boat captain while they are in the lifeboat, because the latter claims that the destroyer crew are his prisoners. The movie also vaguely alludes to the \\"enemy\\" being evil (or the devil), not particularly the Nazis (\\"You cut off one head and it grows another...\\"). This gives the title \\"The Enemy Below\\" a double meaning not present in the book.

Production The destroyer escort USS Haynes (DE-181) was portrayed by the , filmed in the Pacific Ocean near Oahu, Hawaii. Many of Whitehursts crewmen acted in the film: The phone talkers, the gun and depth charge crews, the sailor fishing, and all of the men seen abandoning ship, were real Whitehurst crewmen. The ship's commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Walter Smith, played the engineering officer. He is the man seen reading comics (Little Orphan Annie) during the lull before the action. In the same scene an enlisted man can be seen reading The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. The Whitehurst was sunk as a target in 1971.

The actual DE-181 was a , . These ships were scrapped in 1969 and 1974 respectively. Music The tune sung by the U-boat crew on the ocean floor between depth charge attacks is from an 18th-century march called \\"Der Dessauer Marsch\\".

He was a hugely prolific composer of Protestant church music, especially motets, and assisted in bringing the stylistic innovations of the Venetian School north across the Alps into Germany. Life Details of his early life are sparse, as is common for composers of the time. He was born in Zittau, and possibly studied with Christoph Demantius there, and also later with Adam Gumpelzhaimer in Augsburg. By 1601 Franck was in Nuremberg, as a music teacher; there he met Hans Leo Hassler, and learned from him both the Venetian polychoral style and the polyphonic style of the high Renaissance, both of which he incorporated into his own composition. In 1602 he took a position as Kapellmeister in Coburg to Prince Johann Casimir, and he remained in Coburg for the rest of his life. For the earlier portion of this time, the situation was ideal for him; he was supported by his patron, and had the resources necessary to carry on his composing. Unfortunately the Thirty Years' War devastated the region around Coburg; in addition to the military depredations, typhus brought by the armies depopulated the entire region and ruined the economy. Franck was fortunate in being able to make a living throughout this terrible period as a musician, unlike his contemporary at Halle, Samuel Scheidt, who lost his Kapellmeister post. Unfortunately, though, Franck's wife and two of his children died. Works Franck was a popular composer, and wrote an enormous amount of music, including more than 40 books of motets for a total of over 600 motets alone; in addition he wrote secular songs, including quodlibets, psalm settings, bicinia, tricinia, instrumental dances and numerous miscellaneous pieces. His motets are varied in style. Many are chorale motets, an exclusively Protestant variation of the motet, and these are written in German. Almost all use the late Renaissance idiom of Lassus, with carefully controlled dissonance and smoothly flowing polyphony. Some are simple and homophonic, and pay unusually close attention to text setting (this was also a trend in the music of the concurrent Catholic Counter-Reformation, and represented a reaction against the music of the previous generations). Others are written in the polychoral style related to the Venetian practice, with the important difference that there is no spatial separation of the choirs: the antiphonal parts are all within the group. However the most unusual is a collection from 1602 called Contrapuncti, which are early examples of fugues. They are strictly contrapuntal, and include real answers; occasionally the points of imitation use stretto. Each successive point of imitation uses as its text the successive verse of the chorale being set. Even though most of his motets use frankly Renaissance contrapuntal idiom, he often used the basso continuo, a relatively recent innovation of the early Baroque, and also used instrumental doublings of the vocal parts. Franck was a conservative composer who was contemporary with the more famous, and much more progressive, Heinrich Sch√ºtz; however his works were popular and often reprinted during his lifetime.

It was built in the suburb of Yarralumla to produce the bricks used to build many of Canberra's early buildings. It opened in around 1913 and operated until its closure in 1976. * Exploring the ACT and Southeast New South Wales, J. Kay McDonald, Kangaroo Press, Sydney, 1985, p41 It is known for producing the bricks used to build itself. Narrow gauge goods railway lines for the transportation of bricks linked Yarralumla to some of the major building sites in central Canberra such as Old Parliament House, and the Kingston Power House. No sign of this early Canberra transport system remains today. The original brick kilns were built according to Walter Burley Griffin's designs with fan forced short chimneys intended to stay below the height of the surrounding pine trees. In 1950 after World War II increased building demands in Canberra meant that a large 46 metre natural-draft chimney was built for the new kilns. This greatly increased brick production capacity. The tall chimney is visible from many locations around central Canberra. In recent years a report found that the tall chimney was not earthquake-safe. As the chimney was heritage listed and located within falling distance of nearby homes, an engineering firm was called in to make it safe. A frame was built inside the chimney to support it without affecting its external appearance. The brickworks today is closed to the public but has had various uses over the past 20 years. There have been several recent ideas that haven't eventuated, including using the site for Canberra's new gaol, making the site the new permanent home for Floriade (a yearly Canberra flower festival) or to turn the brickworks into a holiday resort. Future plans for the site are still undecided. As of February 2015 it was proposed that a housing estate could be constructed on the site, consisting of 1800 dwellings.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-02-24/revised- plan-for-yarralumla-brickworks/6230708 References Category:Manufacturing plants in Australia Category:Buildings and structures in Canberra Category:Brickworks in Australia Category:Australian Capital Territory Heritage Register ","title":"Yarralumla brickworks"},{"id":"1167201","text":"Urodon is a small genus from the family Fabaceae native to southwestern Australia.

Despite the popularity of the service on its primary route, which parallels busy Interstate 95 along much of the eastern coast of the United States in five states, the company failed financially after operating for almost 10 years. After a hiatus, a similarly named and operated service (Auto Train) was begun under the government-financed Amtrak in 1983, which became one of the railroad's most popular services.  History  An idea of Auto- Train Corporation founder Eugene K. Garfield, a former employee of the US Department of Transportation, the novel approach allowed families to relax en route and save the expense and unfamiliarity of a rental car on arrival.. The Auto-Train consists included passenger cars, autoracks, and a caboose.. Although the company had its own locomotives and rolling stock, Auto-Train Corporation trains initially operated on Seaboard Coast Line (SCL) and Richmond, Fredericksburg & Potomac (RF&P;) tracks. Auto-Train Corporation's new service began operations on December 6, 1971, between Lorton, Virginia, and Sanford, Florida. The service was a big hit with travelers. Before long, the ambitious entrepreneurs of Auto-Train were looking to expand into other markets, and even established a short-lived service between Louisville and Sanford, Florida. Lack of success from the Louisville expansion, high crew costs, and several accidents put Garfield's company into bankruptcy. Auto- Train Corporation was forced to end its services in late April 1981. = Amtrak revival = Operating for almost 10 years, Auto-Train had developed a popular following, particularly among older travelers. No one else offered a similar service until, after a gap of almost two years, service was revived by Amtrak (the National Railroad Passenger Corporation), a federally chartered corporation that operates most intercity passenger trains in the United States, as their Auto Train service.  Rolling stock  = Locomotives = Auto-Train utilized a fleet of sixteen GE U36B locomotives as the primary motive power for its trains. Also included in the roster were Baldwin S-12, Baldwin VO-1000, and ALCO S-2 locomotives that were used as switchers in the terminal stations. = Dome cars = Auto-Train 707, a \\"Maxi-Dome\\" coach, in 1978 Auto-Train acquired a significant number of dome cars, so many that in 1974 it did not roster any conventional coaches. These included seven ex- Western Pacific dome coaches, each seating 36, which Auto-Train called \\"Mini- Domes\\". These had previously run on the California Zephyr. It also acquired all but one of the Santa Fe's Big Domes (six dormitory-lounges and seven of eight full lounges) and the lion's share of the Union Pacific's Astra Dome fleet: seven coaches, nine dining cars, and 14 lounge-observation cars. Two of the Big Dome lounges and two of the Astra Dome lounges were rebuilt as \\"Night Club\\" cars. The remainder of the Astra Domes were dubbed \\"Maxie-Domes\\", as opposed to the \\"Mini-Domes\\". = Food service cars = Auto-Train acquired a wide variety of food-service cars. These included ex-Seaboard kitchen- dormitory cars, ex-Seaboard dining cars rebuilt as buffet cars, and five Norfolk and Western and Western Pacific coaches which were also rebuilt as buffet cars. = Sleeping cars = Sleeping cars acquired by Auto-Train included six ex-Santa Fe Regal series sleeping cars (four bedrooms, four compartments, two drawing rooms), five ex-Union Pacific Ocean series sleeping cars (five bedrooms, two compartment, two drawing rooms), and three ex- Seaboard sleepers (five bedrooms, one compartment, four sections, four roomettes). = Nonpassenger stock = Auto-Train 125, an autorack, in 1978 The centerpieces of the Auto-Train were the 62 ex-Canadian National bilevel autoracks, which were acquired between 1971 and 1973. The passenger equipment acquired by Auto-Train used steam heat, so the company also acquired steam generator cars. These were mostly former Great Northern cars, but the Auto- Train also rebuilt several former Western Pacific and Santa Fe baggage cars into steam generator cars.

Directed by series' creator Craig McCracken at his feature-length directorial debut from a screenplay written by himself, Charlie Bean, Lauren Faust, Paul Rudish and Don Shank, the film stars the regular television cast of Cathy Cavadini, Tara Strong, E. G. Daily, Roger L. Jackson, Tom Kane, Tom Kenny and Jennifer Hale. Serving as a prequel to the series, the film tells the origin story of how the Powerpuff Girls were created and how they came to be the defenders of Townsville. James L. Venable, who composed the score for the series, composed the film's score. Produced by Cartoon Network Studios as its first and only theatrical film, The Powerpuff Girls Movie was theatrically released on July 3, 2002 by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film grossed $16.4 million on an $11 million budget and received generally favorable reviews from critics. Plot In the crime and injustice-riddled city of Townsville, Professor Utonium creates a mixture of sugar, spice, and everything nice in the hopes of producing the \\"perfect little girl\\" to improve Townsville. However, he gets shoved by his laboratory assistant, the destructive chimpanzee Jojo, which causes him to accidentally break and spill a flask of Chemical X onto the concoction. The experiment is successful, producing three little girls whom the Professor names Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup. He also discovers that the girls have gained superpowers from the added Chemical X. Despite the girls' recklessness with their powers, they all immediately grow to love each other as a family. On their first day of school, the girls learn about the game of tag and begin to play it among themselves, which quickly grows destructive once they use their powers. The girls take their game downtown, where they accidentally cause massive damage to the city until the Professor calms them down. The next day, the girls are treated as outcasts by the citizens of Townsville as a result of the destruction they have caused and the Professor is arrested for creating the girls. Believing that using their powers again will only anger the townspeople more, the girls try to make their way home from school on foot, but they become lost in an alleyway and are attacked by the Gangreen Gang. They are rescued by Jojo, whose brain has been mutated by the Chemical X explosion, giving him superintelligence. Planning control of the city and revenge on the Professor for replacing him with the girls, Jojo gains the girls' sympathy by convincing them that he is also hated for his powers; he tricks the girls into helping him build a laboratory and machine powered by Chemical X, which he claims will earn them the affections of the city. Afterwards, Jojo rewards the girls with a trip to the local zoo, where he secretly implants small transportation devices on all the primates there, to which that night Jojo brings the primates to his lab and uses his new machine to inject them with Chemical X, which turns them into evil mutants like himself. The next morning, after the Professor is released from prison, the girls show him all the \\"good\\" they have done, only to discover that the city is under attack by the primates. Jojo, renaming himself as Mojo Jojo, publicly announces the girls as his assistants, which damages their reputation further and makes the distraught Professor lose faith in them. Dejected, the girls exile themselves to an asteroid in outer space. Mojo Jojo announces his intention to rule the planet, but becomes frustrated when his minions disobey him and concoct their own plans to terrorize Townsville. Overhearing the turmoil from space, the girls return to Earth and rescue the citizens, realizing they can use their powers to fight the primates. After his army is defeated, Mojo Jojo injects himself with Chemical X and grows into a giant monster, overpowering the girls in an intense battle. Rejecting Mojo Jojo's offer of an alliance to take over the world, the girls push him off a decrepit skyscraper as soon as the Professor arrives with an antidote for Chemical X to help the girls. Mojo Jojo lands on the Antidote X, which shrinks him down to his original size, battered and defeated. The girls consider using the Antidote X to erase their powers, thinking they would be accepted as normal girls, but the people of Townsville protest against this and apologize for misjudging them, thanking them for their heroic deeds. At the request of Townsville's Mayor, the girls agree to use their powers to defend Townsville with the Professor's permission, becoming the city's beloved crime-fighting superhero team \\"the Powerpuff Girls\\".

Production When developing the film, series' creator/director Craig McCracken did not want the film to appeal exclusively to girls as the merchandise made it out to be (with jewelry and necklaces being sold with the characters plastered over it) and wanted to make a film about what the Powerpuff Girls were really meant to be. When deciding what the final plot would be, the crew had \\"one that was purely an action show, and then one that was more of a subtle character piece\\"; Cartoon Network liked both of them, so the result is an hybrid. McCracken said that there was no real difference when directing a film in comparison to a standard TV episode: During production, McCracken was originally encouraged by Cartoon Network to make an edgier movie; he recalls via Tumblr: The film's animation was provided by Rough Draft Korea, with additional animation done at Mercury Filmworks and Munich Animation Film. It also went on to have some minor edits in pacing for the final cut, but \\"nothing so disastrous that it affected the final film\\", in McCracken's words. It was also noted that the promotion was rather limited when compared to that of other animated feature films that premiered around the same year, such as Hey Arnold!: The Movie. However, the creator said that Warner Bros. was putting $20 million into promoting the film. Some of the production process was also documentated for subsequent home releases of the product. According to McCracken, 49 half-hour episodes of the TV series had been made up to that point, but they went on hiatus to focus on the making of the movie. The crew was also against including pop songs or any musical numbers that could interfere \\"in the body of the story\\", in order to respect audience expectations. However, the final credits are accompanied by a punk- rock version of the TV show's ending theme by Bis, and a song by the pop group No Secrets, titled \\"That's What Girls Do\\". Release The Powerpuff Girls Movie was released in theaters on July 3, 2002, before making its television debut on Cartoon Network on May 23, 2003. In theaters, the film was accompanied with a Dexter's Laboratory short titled \\"Chicken Scratch\\", which later aired as part of the series' fourth season. =Home media= The film was released on Region 1 VHS and DVD on November 5, 2002. The DVD included extras such as deleted scenes, behind-the-scenes footage and audio commentaries. Despite being filmed in 1.85:1 aspect ratio, the DVD and VHS are in fullscreen only, much akin to that of the original series. The Region 2 DVD release presents the film in its original widescreen aspect ratio, but omits the audio commentary, the bonus features and is also in the PAL format. As of 2020, the film has yet to be released on Blu-ray. Reception =Critical response= Series' creator Craig McCraken said that due to the film's production, he doesn't plan on making any more theatrical films following The Powerpuff Girls Movie. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has received a 63% approval rating based on 103 reviews; the average rating is 6.14/10. The consensus reads: \\"It plays like an extended episode, but The Powerpuff Girls Movie is still lots of fun.\\" On Metacritic, the film achieved a rating of 65 out of 100 based on 25 reviews, which indicates \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Bob Longino of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution praised the film, writing: \\"The intricate drawings emanate 1950s futuristic pizazz like a David Hockney scenescape. The inspired script is both sinfully cynical and aw-shucks sweet\\". He also called it \\"one of the few American creations that is both gleeful pop culture and exquisite high art.\\" Nell Minow of Common Sense Media gave the film four stars out of a possible five, saying that the film \\"may be a treat for the fans of the show, but its non-stop excitement and sense of humor is going to win over just about anyone\\".\\"The Powerpuff Girls Movie Movie Review\\", Common Sense Media at CommonSenseMedia.org Virginia Heffernan of The Tuscaloosa News said that \\"the movie is cute [...] but its violent, snickering style is pure Americana\\", and that it evokes the \\"outlandish classic\\" look of McCracken's inspirations. Ben Nuckols wrote for The Albany Herald that the protagonist's big eyes were the \\"only remarkable thing\\", which he considered \\"a shame, because the girls are delightful and the movie is skillfully made\\". New Sunday Times praised the animation - particularly the sequence were the Powerpuff Girls play tag - and said that \\"there's a lot to like about this movie\\"; overall, it called it a \\"a good first movie\\". Jerry Beck wrote for Animation World Network that the film was \\"good looking [...] but suffered from story problems\\", whereas Christene Meyers, from Billings Gazette, thought that the story could have been told in a few minutes. Mariano Kairuz, from the Argentine newspaper P√°gina/12, wrote in the film's release year: ¬´It's one of the happily bizarre cartoon movies to hit theaters in quite some time. One might even wonder how Cartoon Network and Warner authorized the multi-million dollar budget for something that looks and feels somewhat uncommercial¬ª. In 2019, Paste magazine ranked it 72nd on its list of the 100 best superhero movies of all time. The film also received some mild criticism for its violence, which many felt was too extreme for a family-oriented film, especially in the wake of the 9/11 attacks the previous year. As such, Roger Ebert gave the film a negative review, criticizing the film's overuse of violence and destruction and saying the film was upsetting to watch after the 9/11 attacks. His partner Richard Roeper also gave the film a negative review, calling it a \\"freaky and annoying little film\\".McCracken himself has come out with his own thoughts on the movie. In the documentary The Powerpuff Girls: Who, What Where, How, Why... Who Cares?, he said: \\"In hindsight, maybe I wish it was a little sillier, a little more lighter, a little more... not so heavy the whole time.\\" In 2016, he stated up on Tumblr that due to the film's production, he has no further interest in making more theatrical feature- length films after The Powerpuff Girls Movie. = Box office = The Powerpuff Girls Movie earned $1.5 million over its opening Fourth of July weekend, ranking seventh place at the North American box office. The film soon grossed $11.4 million domestically and $5 million overseas for a worldwide total of $16.4 million, making it a commercial failure considering its $11 million budget. Screen Rant lists it as one of the 25 lowest-grossing superhero movies at the global box office.

It was released for the Nintendo 64 in 1996 and is a follow-up to the 1992 Game Boy title Wave Race. Most of the game involves the player racing on a Jet Ski on a variety of courses while successfully manoeuvring the vehicle around various buoys. A multiplayer mode where two players can compete against each other on a chosen course is also included. The game supports the Controller Pak, which allows players to transfer saved data from one game cartridge to another. Originally referred to as \\"F-Zero on water\\", the game was intended to feature high-speed boats with transforming capabilities. However, these were ultimately replaced with Jet Skis as producer Shigeru Miyamoto felt that the game would not be differentiated enough from other titles on other systems. Wave Race 64 received acclaim from critics, who praised the game's satisfying controls and dynamic watery environments. The game is credited for helping Nintendo effectively make its paradigmatic leap from the 16-bit 2D graphics of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System to the Nintendo 64's 3D capabilities. It was re-released for the Wii and Wii U's Virtual Console in 2007 and 2016, respectively. A sequel, Wave Race: Blue Storm, was released in 2001. Gameplay The player races an opponent on the Sunny Beach course. The arrows at the bottom right corner of the screen indicate the Jet Ski's current power. Wave Race 64 is a racing game in which players race on Jet Skis in different weather conditions and on a variety of courses. The game features three single-player modes (Championship, Time Trials, and Stunt Mode) as well as a multiplayer mode for competitive play. In the Championship mode, the player must race opponents through a series of courses and win the first place. Up to four levels of difficulty can be chosen: Normal, Hard, Expert and Reverse, the latter being Expert with the tracks oriented backwards. Hard, Expert, and Reverse must be unlocked by completing an earlier difficulty. The difficulty also determines the number of courses played: six in Normal, seven in Hard, and eight in Expert/Reverse. When the player completes a course, points are awarded based on the rank they finished. If the required quantity is not met, the player will be disqualified and the game will be over. While racing opponents, the player must successfully manoeuvre the Jet Ski around various buoys. There are two types of buoys: red colored, which must be passed on the right side, and yellow buoys, which must be passed on the left side. Each time a buoy is correctly passed, a power arrow in the game's HUD will light, allowing the player's Jet Ski to gain speed. Up to five power arrows can be lit in order to obtain maximum power. Therefore, maintaining this process will allow the player to maintain a high speed. Failure to correctly pass a single buoy will result in the loss of all the player's accumulated power (though the power arrows can be lit again one by one) and missing five buoys over the course of a race will result in disqualification. Leaving the course area limited by pink buoys for more than five seconds will also result in disqualification. In Time Trials, the player can freely race on a course to perform the best times, which are recorded in the game's data. In the Stunt Mode, the player must earn points by executing stunts and passing through rings. The points depend upon how many rings the player passes through without missing, as well as the class of stunt that has been performed. The multiplayer mode uses a horizontal split-screen and allows two players to compete against each other on a chosen course. Only the courses that have been unlocked in the Championship mode can be played in the Time Trials, Stunt, and multiplayer modes. The game offers four personalized racers for players to select from, each having their own strengths and weaknesses. A Nintendo 64 Controller Pak can be used to transfer saved data from one game cartridge to another. Development and release Wave Race 64 was developed by Nintendo EAD and produced by Shigeru Miyamoto as one of the first Nintendo 64 games. It is a follow-up to the 1992 Game Boy title Wave Race. Development of the game was led by Shinya Takahashi, who had been working with Nintendo since 1989. Takahashi, along with Yoshiaki Koizumi, who worked with Miyamoto on Super Mario 64, is credited for helping the company effectively make its paradigmatic leap from the 16-bit 2D graphics of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System to the Nintendo 64's 3D capabilities. Since the game's engineers only had experience with the 2D graphics of earlier Nintendo consoles, Takahashi had to guide them through the first stages of development. While experimenting with the Nintendo 64's Silicon Graphics technology, one of the programmers created a tech demo that served as an example of the game's wave programming. The tech demo caught the attention of Miyamoto, and soon the team began to figure out a way to create \\"something fun\\" from it. Originally, the game was referred to as \\"F-Zero on water\\" and would feature high-speed boats, as shown in footage from the 1995 Nintendo Shoshinkai show. These boats were expected to have transforming capabilities, allowing players to switch from a stable catamaran-style form to a more streamlined canoe-style version. However, the boats were ultimately replaced with Jet Skis. According to Miyamoto, \\"Boats looked pretty good at the show, but I didn't think that Wave Race 64 would be unique from similar games on other systems if we used boats. Jet Skis can show many maneuvers that work well in the realistic water of Wave Race 64.\\" The use of Jet Skis was suggested by Rare's Tim Stamper. The game uses the Nintendo 64's alpha blending feature to make the water simultaneously transparent and reflective. Wave Race 64 was first released in Japan in September 1996 on an 8-MB cartridge. In the United States, Wave Race 64 was released as the third Nintendo 64 game in November 1996, featuring voice changes and renamed levels. It was the first racing game developed for the Nintendo 64 and the first to use the Nintendo 64's hardware capabilities to \\"create a believable and engaging water environment unmatched by previous games\\", IGN noted. In the United Kingdom, the game was released in April 1997, shortly after the launch of the Nintendo 64. Like Super Mario 64, Wave Race 64 was re-issued in Japan in July 1997 as . This version takes advantage of the Nintendo 64 Rumble Pak and adds ghost functions to the game's time trial mode. Some music and sound effects were altered as well. Reception Wave Race 64 was a critical and commercial success, selling more than 154,000 units in Japan by December 1996 and more than one million units in the United States by December 1997. As of December 2007, the game had sold 1.95 million copies in the United States. At the time of its release, some reviewers considered it to be one of the greatest racing games of all time on a home console. GamePro described Wave Race 64 as a \\"phenomenally fun\\" racing game that captivates players with its deep and challenging gameplay, while Next Generation regarded it as one of the first quality titles released for the Nintendo 64, along with Super Mario 64 and Pilotwings 64. Graphically, Wave Race 64 was praised for its fluid animations, realistic physics, clean waters, and textured polygons. IGNs Doug Perry commented, \\"The way in which jetskis cut into the ocean's surface, lift off ramps, bounce into and off oncoming waves, or slide on icy surfaces is not only believable and engaging, but simply unparalleled.\\" Writing for The Electric Playground, Victor Lucas highlighted the game's distinct environments, saying that each course offers players something to get excited about. He also gave high marks to the game's satisfying sound effects, particularly when players submerge under the waves, but felt the music was shallow. GamePro agreed, describing the music as juvenile and the announcer's voice as irritating. In contrast, AllGame's Jonti Davies felt that the game's \\"cheesy\\" and \\"distinctly '80s theme\\" soundtrack combined with the announcer's \\"hyperexcited cries\\" gives the game a light and arcade feel. N64 Magazine journalists described Wave Race 64 as \\"one of the deepest racing games\\" they had played, stating that the game's dynamic waves \\"constantly tests and re- tests\\" the player's control and that the buoys system offers \\"tactical decisions about whether to spend time taking a wide corner or dash straight on to catch the leader before it's too late.\\" Similarly, Game Informer remarked that the waves can strike players on every turn and that \\"one mistake can mean the difference between victory and defeat.\\" Edge highly praised the game's believable watery environments and satisfying controls, stating that each of the game's four crafts feature different handling characteristics, which is accentuated by the way they interact with the water. Although the magazine criticized the game's lack of courses, noting that most of them can be seen in a day's play, it ultimately concluded that Wave Race 64 \\"is a perfect example of how Nintendo's approach to game design still remains markedly different from almost every other videogames company in the world.\\" The controls were generally praised, although Todd Mowatt of Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) noted that getting used to them can take some time. Glenn Rubenstein of GameSpot also praised the controls, stating that Wave Race 64 \\"makes the best use yet\\" of the Nintendo 64 analog stick. Although he highlighted the multiplayer mode for offering a \\"fairly good competition\\", he criticized its small split-screen play areas for detracting from the drama. Alex Huhtala of CVG felt that the game was too short, but admitted that the multiplayer and stunt modes give the game longevity. In March 1997, EGM editors named Wave Race 64 their Sports Game of the Year and a runner-up for their Nintendo 64 Game of the Year award (behind Super Mario 64), citing the realistic physics and variety of tracks. Legacy After its release on the Nintendo 64, Wave Race 64 has been included in several top lists. In 1997, EGM ranked the game 68th on its list of 100 Best Games of All Time. In 1999, Next Generation ranked it 20th on a similar list, commenting that, \\"Next to Mario 64, no other game in the Nintendo 64's launch library demonstrated more clearly the power of the new system.\\" IGN editors ranked it 33rd on their 2003 list of Top 100 Games of All Time, and 37th on another list published in 2005. They remarked that Wave Race 64 \\"incorporated water physics into racing unlike any game before it, or any since. The simple concept of racing on jet skis was complicated by changing wave patterns, swells, and rising tides, and Nintendo added its trademark depth to broaden and deepen the unique racer.\\" In 2006, Nintendo Power placed Wave Race 64 at 127th in its \\"Top 200\\" games list. A sequel, Wave Race: Blue Storm, was released in 2001. Wave Race 64 was released in China for the iQue Player console in 2003. A 1-hour demo of the game was also included with the console. On August 6, 2007, the game was released on the Wii's Virtual Console. Unlike the Nintendo 64 version, the Virtual Console release does not feature Kawasaki banners due to expired licensing deals. These were replaced by Wii and Nintendo DS advertisements. However, when the game was released on the Wii U's Virtual Console in 2016, the Kawasaki banners were restored. The Virtual Console versions of the game were generally very well received, with reviewers considering the game to be just as much fun as it was on the Nintendo 64.

The paths of the songlines are recorded in traditional song cycles, stories, dance, and art, and are often the basis of ceremonies. They are a vital part of Aboriginal culture, connecting people to their land. Description The Dreaming, or the Dreamtime, has been described as \\"a sacred narrative of Creation that is seen as a continuous process that links traditional Aboriginal people to their origins\\". Ancestors are believed to play a large role in the establishment of sacred sites as they traversed the continent long ago. Animals were created in the Dreaming, and also played a part in creation of the lands and heavenly bodies. Songlines connect places and Creation events, and the ceremonies associated with those places. Oral history about places and the journeys are carried in song cycles, and each Aboriginal person has obligations to their birthplace. The songs become the basis of the ceremonies that are enacted in those specific places along the Songlines. A songline has been called a \\"dreaming track\\", as it marks a route across the land or sky followed by one of the creator-beings or ancestors in the Dreaming. A knowledgeable person is able to navigate across the land by repeating the words of the song, which describe the location of landmarks, waterholes, and other natural phenomena. In some cases, the paths of the creator-beings are said to be evident from their marks, or petrosomatoglyphs, on the land, such as large depressions in the land which are said to be their footprints. By singing the songs in the appropriate sequence, Aboriginal people could navigate vast distances, often travelling through the deserts of Australia's interior. The continent of Australia contains an extensive system of songlines, some of which are of a few kilometres, whilst others traverse hundreds of kilometres through lands of many different Aboriginal peoples ‚Äî peoples who may speak markedly different languages and have different cultural traditions. Since a songline can span the lands of several different language groups, different parts of the song are said to be in those different languages. Languages are not a barrier because the melodic contour of the song describes the nature of the land over which the song passes. The rhythm is what is crucial to understanding the song. Listening to the song of the land is the same as walking on this songline and observing the land. Neighbouring groups are connected because the song cycles criss-cross all over the continent. All Aboriginal groups traditionally share beliefs in the ancestors and related laws; people from different groups interacted with each other based on their obligations along the songlines. In some cases, a songline has a particular direction, and walking the wrong way along a songline may be a sacrilegious act (e.g. climbing up Uluru where the correct direction is down). Traditional Aboriginal people regard all land as sacred, and the songs must be continually sung to keep the land \\"alive\\". Molyneaux and Vitebsky note that the Dreaming Spirits \\"also deposited the spirits of unborn children and determined the forms of human society,\\" thereby establishing tribal law and totemic paradigms. Anthropologist Robert Tonkinson described Mardu songlines in his 1978 monograph The Mardudjara Aborigines - Living The Dream In Australia's Desert. In his 1987 book The Songlines, British novelist and travel writer Bruce Chatwin describes the songlines as: Examples * The Yolngu people of Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory tell the story of Barnumbirr, a creator-being associated with the planet Venus, who came from the island of Baralku in the East, guiding the first humans to Australia, and then flew across the land from East to West, naming and creating the animals, plants, and natural features of the land. * The Yarralin people of the Victoria River Valley venerate the spirit Walujapi as the Dreaming Spirit of the black-headed python.

Thus, the songlines tend to follow the ridge lines, and this is also where much of the sacred art, such as the Sydney Rock Engravings, is located. In contrast, in many other parts of Australia, the songlines tend to follow valleys, where water may be found more easily. * Songlines have been linked to Aboriginal art sites in the Wollemi National Park in New South Wales.

The present Imperial House of Japan is descended from the Northern Court emperors. The Northern dynasty is also referred to as the \\"senior line\\" or the ; Jimy≈ç-in was a temple and retirement residence of this line's emperors Go-Fukakusa and Fushimi. Nanboku-ch≈ç overview The Imperial seats during the Nanboku-ch≈ç period were in relatively close proximity, but geographically distinct. They were conventionally identified as: The origins of the Northern Court go back to Emperor Go-Saga, who reigned from 1242 through 1246.Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). Annales des empereurs du japon, pp. 245‚Äì247. Go-Saga was succeeded in turn by two of his sons, Emperor Go-FukakusaTitsingh, pp. 248‚Äì255. and Emperor Kameyama.Titsingh, pp. 255‚Äì261. On his death bed in 1272, Go-Saga insisted that his sons adopt a plan in which future emperors from the two fraternal lines would ascend the throne in alternating succession.Titsingh, p. 261. This plan proved to be unworkable, resulting in rival factions and rival claimants to the throne. In 1333, when the Southern Emperor Go-Daigo staged the Kenmu Restoration and revolted against the H≈çj≈ç Kamakura shogunate, the newly minted sh≈çgun Ashikaga Takauji (ironically, by Emperor Go-Daigo himself) responded by declaring Emperor K≈çgon, Go-Daigo's second cousin once removed and the son of an earlier emperor, Emperor Go-Fushimi of the Jimy≈çin-t≈ç, as the new emperor. After the destruction of the Kamakura shogunate in 1333, K≈çgon lost his claim, but his brother, Emperor K≈çmy≈ç, and two of his sons were supported by the new Ashikaga sh≈çguns as the rightful claimants to the throne. K≈çgon's family thus formed an alternate Imperial Court in Kyoto, which came to be called the Northern Court because its seat was in a location north of its rival. Cloistered Emperor Go-Daigo failed to control succession to the Imperial throne, whereby the Ashikaga sh≈çguns were able to wrestle any remaining power away from position of Emperor. Sh≈çguns ruled Japan until 1867. Southern Court The Imperial Court supported by the Ashikaga shoguns was rivaled by the Southern Court of Go-Daigo and his descendants. This came to be called the Southern Court because its seat was in a location south of its rival. Although the precise location of the emperors' seat did change, it was often identified as simply Yoshino. In 1392, Emperor Go-Kameyama of the Southern Court was defeated and abdicated in favor of K≈çgon's great-grandson, Emperor Go-Komatsu, thus ending the divide. The Northern Court was under the power of the Ashikaga shoguns and had little real independence. Partly because of this, since the 19th century, the Emperors of the Southern Imperial Court have been considered the legitimate Emperors of Japan. Moreover, the Southern Court controlled the Japanese imperial regalia. The Northern Court members are not considered legitimate Japanese emperors. They are called \\"Northern Court Emperors\\" now. One Southern Court descendant, Kumazawa Hiromichi, declared himself to be Japan's rightful emperor in the days after the end of the Pacific War. He claimed that Emperor Hirohito was a fraud, arguing that Hirohito's entire line is descended from the Northern Court. Despite this, he was not arrested for l√®se majest√©, even when donning the Imperial Crest. He could and did produce a koseki detailing his bloodline back to Emperor Go-Daigo in Yoshino, but his claims and rhetoric failed to inspire anything other than sympathy.Dower, John W. (1999). Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II, pp. 306-307. Re-unification of Imperial courts Go-Kameyama reached an agreement with Go-Komatsu to return to the old alternations on a ten-year plan. However, Go- Komatsu broke this promise, not only ruling for 20 years, but being succeeded by his own son, rather than by one from the former Southern Court. During the Meiji period, an Imperial decree dated March 3, 1911, established that the legitimate reigning monarchs of this period were the direct descendants of Emperor Go-Daigo through Emperor Go-Murakami, whose Southern Court had been established in exile in Yoshino, near Nara.Thomas, Julia Adeney.

He was head of the Habsburg Leopoldian line from 1411. Biography Ernest was born in Bruck an der Mur in Styria, the third son of Duke Leopold III of Austria (1351-1386) and his consort Viridis Visconti (d. 1414), a daughter of Bernab√≤ Visconti, Lord of Milan. Shortly after his birth, his father and his uncle Albert III divided the Habsburg lands by the 1379 Treaty of Neuberg: while Albert and his Albertinian descendants would rule over the Duchy of Austria proper, the Leopoldian line received the Inner Austrian states of Styria, Carinthia and Carniola with the remaining March of Istria, as well as Tyrol and the Further Austrian possessions. After Leopold's death in the 1386 Battle of Sempach, young Ernest and his brothers William, Leopold IV and Frederick IV remained under the guardianship of their uncle Albert III. Coat of arms of Duke Ernest of Austria (1627) In 1401 Ernest accompanied King Rupert of Germany on his campaign to Italy. When their elder brother William died in 1406, the remaining three sons of Leopold III agreed about the partition of their patrimony: In the separation agreement of 1406, Ernest received Styria, Carinthia and Carniola, and jointly with his elder brother Leopold IV (the current head of the Leopoldian line) held the guardianship over their minor nephew Albert V of Austria, grandson of Duke Albert III. Tyrol and Further Austria passed to the youngest brother Frederick IV. In 1407, however, conflicts between Leopold and Ernest resulted in a civil war that lasted until May 1409. When Leopold died without male heirs in 1411, Ernest finally became the uncontested head of the Leopoldian branch. In 1414, he became the last Duke to be enthroned according to Carantanian traditional rite at the Prince's Stone in Carinthia, and from that time on called himself 'archduke'. He was the first Habsburg to actually use this title, which had been invented by his uncle Duke Rudolf IV. Ernest was made a member of the Order of the Dragon and of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem in 1414, however, he became bitter with the Luxembourg king Sigismund from 1412 onwards. When his brother Frederick IV, a supporter of Antipope John XXIII at the Council of Constance, was banned by the king in 1417, Ernest first attempted to gain control over Frederick's territories himself, but then came to an agreement with him and successfully defended Tyrol against Sigismund's pretensions. Ernest turned out to be a capable ruler of the Inner Austrian lands; his eldest son Frederick V would become sole heir of all Habsburg lines, elected King of the Romans in 1440 and crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 1452. Ernest died at Bruck an der Mur, and was buried in the Cistercian monastery of Rein near Graz. His nickname the Iron only came into use after his death. Family and children Ernest the Iron and his sons On 14 January 1392, Ernest married his first wife, Margaret of Pomerania. She was a daughter of the Griffin duke Bogislaw V of Pomerania and his second wife, Adelheid of Brunswick-Grubenhagen. They had no children. She died in either 1407 or 1410, according to contradictory necrologies. Margaret of Pomerania by Anton Boys On 25 January 1412, Ernest married his second wife, the Piast princess Cymburgis of Masovia, who was his equal in vitality and with whom he had nine children: * Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor (21 September 1415 - 19 August 1493) * Margaret of Austria (1416/17 - 12 February 1486), married on 3 June 1431 to Frederick II, Elector of Saxony * Albert VI, Archduke of Austria (18 December 1418 - 2 December 1463) * Alexander of Austria (died 1420) * Rudolf of Austria (d. before 1424) * Catherine of Austria (1420 - 11 September 1493), married on 15 July 1447 to Charles I, Margrave of Baden-Baden * Leopold of Austria (d. before 1424) * Anna of Austria (d. 11 November 1429) * Ernest of Austria (d. 10 August 1432) As the ruler of Inner Austria and founder of the older Styrian line of the Habsburgs, which, by their son, Frederick III survived the Albertinian (Austrian) and Tyrolean lines, Ernest and Cymburgis became the ancestors of all later emperors of the Habsburg Monarchy.

The town was originally known as Cross Roads, and was named Ruatorea in 1913, from the MƒÅori Rua-a- T≈çrea (the storage pit of T≈çrea). In 1925 the name was changed to \\"Ruatoria\\", although some texts retain the original spelling. As of the 2013 census, it was the third largest centre of population in the sparsely populated region, yet had a population of only 750 (18 less than the region's second largest town, Tolaga Bay). This was a decrease of less than 1% (6 people) since the 2006 census. It is the centre of population and largest town in the Waiapu Valley. 94.8% of the population is MƒÅori, and 46% of the population is able to speak te reo MƒÅori ‚Äî both significantly higher than regional or national averages. Ruatoria's Whakarua Park is the home of the East Coast Rugby Football Union. Geography As the crow flies, Ruatoria is approximately north-northeast of Gisborne, and southwest of the East Cape Lighthouse. By road it is from Gisborne, off State Highway 35. It is at the bottom of the Waiapu Valley on the banks of the Waiapu River just downstream of where the river is formed by the joining of the Mata and Tapuaeroa Rivers. =Climate= Precipitation is prodigiously high ‚Äî the annual average precipitation total approaches . Precipitation is heavy all year-round, yet is particularly prodigious in the austral winter months from May to September. On 7 February 1973, Ruatoria had the highest ever air temperature recorded in the North Island (), the same day the nation's highest temperature was recorded in the South Island town of Rangiora (). Industry The principal industries in the district are related to agriculture and forestry. Attempts to sink oil wells in the area in the 1920s proved unprofitable. History The original shop, bunk house and cook house in the township of Tuparoa were destroyed by fire on two occasions between 1907 and 1913. Commerce was moved inland 5 miles to the area known as The Crossroads, northeast of the present town sitting on the area of the first river plain where it drops to the present river plain where the roads went north-south and to the east. (There was a race course on land alongside the Waiapu River below The Crossroads but that was abandoned by the end of the second world war). The Crossroads too was destroyed by fire during the first world war and in 1920 the first general store and accommodation was erected by William Hayes Owen Johnston (1890-1960) on what is now Tuparoa Road. (The shop has been dismantled after his death in 1960) He is buried with his third wife in the cemetery at Mahora on the Tuparoa road just before the junction with the side road to Reparoa. (His first and second wives were of the Gerrard family of Tuparoa and are buried in the cemetery at the top of the hill on the northern side of the creek which separated the old Tuparoa settlement). From about 1925 onwards, Ruatoria began to replace Tuparoa as the main urban centre of the East Coast district of New Zealand. The transition to Ruatoria from Tuparoa was brought about by the increased reliability of State Highway 35, which at that time ran via the main street of Ruatoria. Tuparoa was disadvantaged by unreliable road access and a lack of all weather harbour. The Rotokautuku Bridge, connecting Ruatoria to the northern side of Waiapu River, was built in 1964. This 1964 bridge replaced the old bridge which had been built in the 1930s. The old piles were used for the new bridge, although they had to be lowered by a metre to accommodate the new bridge. In the 1980s, Ruatoria was briefly notorious for an outbreak of arson attacks in the town, during a period of severe economic downturn. Significance to MƒÅori The NgƒÅti Porou proverb of identity relates to the area ‚Äî Ko Hikurangi te maunga, ko Waiapu te awa, ko NgƒÅti Porou te iwi (Hikurangi is the mountain, Waiapu is the river, NgƒÅti Porou is the tribe). Ruatoria is within the iwi's rohe, and Te Runanganui o NgƒÅti Porou has offices located in the town. The Waiapu River is of immense cultural, spiritual, economic, and traditional value to local MƒÅori. According to traditional beliefs, a number of taniwha dwell in and protect the river, in turn protecting the valley and its hap≈´. Taniwha believed to be in Waiapu River include Kotuwainuku, Kotuwairangi, Ohinewaiapu, and Ngungurutehorowhatu. According to an affidavit of Hapukuniha Te Huakore Karaka, two taniwha were placed in strategic locations in the river to protect the hap≈´ from invading tribes ‚Äî one near Paoaruku (a locality at ), and one at the Wairoa River (a small creek at ). Karaka said that a bridge was built from Tikitiki to Waiomatatini, to the protest of local MƒÅori who were concerned that it would disturb the taniwha. The night before the bridge was completed, a storm came washing the bridge away ‚Äî the weather till then had been calm. From then, one person would drown in the river nearly every year. If it did not happen one year, two would drown the next. A local tohunga, George Gage (Hori Te Kou-o-rehua Keeti) was approached to help the situation, and after that there were no similar drownings. =Marae= Ruatoria has several marae belonging to NgƒÅti Porou hap≈´: * Hiruharama Marae and Kapohanga a Rangi meeting house, a meeting place of Te Aitanga a Mate and Te Aowera. * Te Aowera Marae and Te Poho o Te Aowera meeting house, a meeting place of Te Aowera. * Te Horo Marae and RƒÅkaitemania meeting house, a meeting place of NgƒÅti Horowai, Te WhƒÅnau a Mahaki and Te WhƒÅnau a Uruhonea. * Kakariki Marae and Rakaihoea meeting house, a meeting place of Te WhƒÅnau a RƒÅkaihoea. * Kariaka Marae and NgƒÅti Porou meeting house, a meeting place of NgƒÅi Tangihaere and Te WhƒÅnau a Hinekehu. * Mangahanea Marae and Hinetapora meeting house, a meeting place of NgƒÅti Uep≈çhatu and Te WhƒÅnau a Hinetapora. * Mangarua or Te Heapera Marae and Te Poho o Mangarua meeting house, a meeting place of Te WhƒÅnau a Hinetapora. * Porourangi or Waiomatatini Marae and Porourangi meeting house, a meeting place of Te WhƒÅnau a Karuai. * Reporua Marae and T≈´ Auau meeting house, a meeting place of NgƒÅti Rangi. * Ruataupare Marae and meeting house, a meeting place of NgƒÅi Tangihaere. * Rauru or Taumata o Mihi Marae and Rauru Nui a Toi meeting house, a meeting place of Te WhƒÅnau a Hinekehu. * Uepohatu Marae and meeting house, a meeting place of NgƒÅti Uep≈çhatu. * Umuariki Marae and meeting house, a meeting place of NgƒÅti Uep≈çhatu and Te WhƒÅnau a Umuariki.

Murchison is located 167 kilometres from Melbourne and is just to the west of the Goulburn Valley Highway between Shepparton and Nagambie. The surrounding countryside contains orchards, vineyards and dairy farms and also HM Prison Dhurringile. At the , Murchison had a population of 925. History =Pre-twentieth century= The Ngooraialum tribe were the Aboriginal inhabitants of the area. The first explorer to enter the Goulburn Valley was Thomas Mitchell who crossed the Goulburn River at Mitchellstown. The first Europeans to visit what would become the site where the drovers Joseph Hawdon and Charles Bonney who drove cattle between Mitchellstown and Adelaide. Squatters started settling the area in 1840 with a school being established that year and a police station in 1841. The aboriginal protectorate was also transferred from Mitchellstown to Murchison in 1840 and closed in 1850. French vigneron Ludovic Marie settled in Murchison in 1850 and established vineyards. He also set up a hotel and punt service over the Goulburn for gold miners travelling between Bendigo and Beechworth. A township was established in 1854 with the town being named after Captain John Murchison, an early settler.Blake, Les (1977) Place Names of Victoria, Melbourne, Vic: Rigby Limited, The town grew rapidly, with a post office opening on 19 January 1855 (replacing an earlier office at Warranga), a flour mill in 1858 and a Presbyterian church and school in 1859. Small selectors started settling the area after 1870. A bridge was built over the Goulburn to replace the punt service in 1871, with a newspaper, courthouse and mechanics' institute being established in 1870. The town grew further in 1875 with the arrival of the first paddle steamer. At that time, Murchison had six hotels, a number of general stores, two flour mills including the highly intact Days Mill and Farm at Murchison South, and numerous stores and services. In 1878, Murchison became the base for operations against Ned Kelly and his gang. The railway reached Murchison East in 1880 and a second station named Murchison was opened on the line to Rushworth in 1890. The building of the Goulburn Weir for irrigation in 1887-90 meant that the Goulburn River was no longer navigable by paddle steamer, which led to Murchison declining in importance. The development of irrigation led to the growth of nearby towns, notably Shepparton. The Waranga Basin was developed in the early part of the twentieth century approximately 15 kilometres from the town. =Twentieth century= Muchison East station Approximately 4,000 Italian, Japanese and German prisoners of war (POWs) were interned near the town between 1941 and 1947. Dhurringile Homestead, 11 kilometres to the north, was used as a POW camp for German officers while the Italians and Japanese were kept at an internment camp in the town. The prisoner of war camp employed 675 people with the Italians and Japanese prisoners working as fruitpickers. The German POWs were not used. After the camps closed in 1947, the internment camp became an Italian war memorial while Dhurringhile Homestead became a minimum security prison, HM Prison Dhurringile. The Italian National Ossario is located at Murchison cemetery and holds the remains of 130 Italian soldiers and civilians who died while interned in Australia. Murchison meteorite On 28 September 1969 a meteorite shower fell 2 kilometres south of Murchison. Many local residents collected samples of these meteorites reducing the chance of contamination.Pepper, F. When a space visitor came to country Victoria ABC News, 2 October 2019. Retrieved 2 October 2019. The rocks were analysed at the NASA Ames Research Center where they were discovered to contain the first convincing evidence of amino acids of extraterrestrial origin, supporting the Miller‚ÄìUrey experiment. The Murchison meteorite samples contained 90 different amino acids, only 19 of which are found on earth. The meteorite has been found to contain the oldest materials known to have reached earth. The Meteorite Park in the centre of Murchison celebrates this discovery. Transport Murchison East station is serviced by V/Line passenger trains on the Shepparton Line. Sport The town has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Kyabram & District Football League. The first grade team won the 2013 league premiership. Golfers play at the course of the Murchison Golf Club on Goulburn Valley Highway, Murchison East.

It was patented in 1987 and approved for medical use in 2002. It is currently marketed by Prometheus Laboratories Inc. (San Diego). Alosetron was withdrawn from the market in 2000 owing to the occurrence of serious life-threatening gastrointestinal adverse effects, but was reintroduced in 2002 with availability and use restricted. Medical uses Alosetron is indicated only for women with severe diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) who have: * chronic IBS symptoms (generally lasting 6 months or longer), * had anatomic or biochemical abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract excluded, and * not responded adequately to conventional therapy. Severe IBS-D includes: diarrhea and 1 or more of the following: * frequent and severe abdominal pain/discomfort, * frequent bowel urgency or fecal incontinence, * disability or restriction of daily activities due to IBS. =Efficacy= The phase III trial for approval was published in 2000 as an industry-funded randomised, placebo-controlled trial (PCT). Its authors found 1 mg alosetron, taken orally twice daily for 12 weeks, was associated with a 12% (CI 4.7-19.2) improvement in relief from abdominal pain and discomfort associated with diarrhoea-predominant patients. The prescription of alosetron is currently approved in the U.S. at 0.5 and 1 mg. The FDA Medical Officer's Review, dated November 4, 1999, noted: ‚ÄúPatients considered by investigators to fit the diarrhea-predominant subtype had at baseline‚Ä¶ stool consistency values that were neither loose nor watery‚Äù. The FDA's Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee referred to the drug's efficacy as \\"modest\\", highlighting that the placebo brought relief on the primary outcome measure to 40‚Äì50% of women. Contraindications Lotronex's prescribing information brochure states that alosetron should not be initiated in patients with constipation. Other contraindications are: history of chronic or severe constipation or sequelae from constipation; intestinal obstruction, stricture, toxic megacolon, gastrointestinal perforation, and/or adhesions, ischemic colitis, impaired intestinal circulation, thrombophlebitis, or hypercoagulable state; Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis; diverticulitis; severe hepatic impairment. Concomitant use of fluvoxamine is also contraindicated. Adverse effects Alosetron was withdrawn in 2000 following the association of alosetron with serious life-threatening gastrointestinal adverse effects. The cumulative incidence of ischaemic colitis was 2 in 1000, while serious complications arising from constipation (obstruction, perforation, impaction, toxic megacolon, secondary colonic ischaemia, death) was 1 in 1000. A 1999 review performed by FDA medical officer John Senior, indicated that 27% of patients experienced constipation. The phase III trial reported constipation occurred in 30% and 3% of patients in the alosetron and placebo groups, respectively. It was cited as the most important reason for patients dropping out of the study. Mechanism of action Alosetron has an antagonist action on the 5-HT3 receptors of the enteric nervous system of the gastrointestinal tract. While being a 5-HT3 antagonist like ondansetron, it is not classified or approved as an antiemetic. Since stimulation of 5-HT3 receptors is positively correlated with gastrointestinal motility, alosetron's 5-HT3 antagonism slows the movement of fecal matter through the large intestine, increasing the extent to which water is absorbed, and decreasing the moisture and volume of the remaining waste products. History Alosetron was originally approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on February 9, 2000, after a seven-month review. At the time of the initial approval U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewers found that alosetron improved symptoms in 10% to 20% of patients. Shipment to pharmacies started in March, 2000. On July 17, a health professional filed a report with the FDA on the death of a 50-year-old woman who suffered mesenteric ischemia. The report identified alosetron as the \\"primary suspect\\" in the death. Alosetron was withdrawn from the market voluntarily by GlaxoWellcome on November 28, 2000 owing to the occurrence of serious life-threatening gastrointestinal adverse effects, including 5 deaths and additional bowel surgeries. The FDA said it had reports of 49 cases of ischemic colitis and 21 cases of \\"severe constipation\\" and that ten of the 70 patients underwent surgeries and 34 others were examined at hospitals and released without surgery. Through November 17, 2000, pharmacists had filled 474,115 prescriptions for alosetron. Severe adverse events continued to be reported, with a final total of 84 instances of ischaemic colitis, 113 of severe constipation, 143 admissions to hospital, and 7 deaths. Patient advocacy groups, most notably the Lotronex Action Group and the International Foundation for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders (IFFGD) lobbied for the drug's return. Public Citizen Health Research Group, another patient advocacy group, opposed the reintroduction. On June 7, 2002, the FDA announced the approval of a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) that allows restricted marketing of Lotronex (alosetron hydrochloride), to treat only women with severe diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The strict prescribing guidelines initially introduced in 2002 were relaxed slightly in 2016, enabling electronic prescriptions among other benefits. It is not known whether alosetron has been filed for registration in the EU. GSK sold Lotronex to the Californian corporation Prometheus in late 2007.Prometheus Laboratories Inc. Press Release of 7 November 2007. Retrieved on 27 August 2008. Since 2015, generic versions of alosetron have been available in the US, sold by a number of different companies including Actavis Pharma Company, Prometheus Laboratories and Sebela Pharmaceuticals Inc =Criticism of the FDA= In 2001, the editor of the renowned medical journal The Lancet, Richard Horton, criticized the FDA's handling of alosetron in an unusually sharp language. Horton argued that the treatment of a non-fatal condition did not justify the use of a drug with potentially lethal side effects, and that the FDA should have revoked the approval for alosetron sooner when postmarketing surveillance revealed that many patients had suffered constipation necessitating surgical intervention and ischaemic colitis. He asserted that FDA officials were improperly motivated to maintain and reinstate the approval for alosetron because of the extent to which the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research is funded by user fees paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers, and that the reinstatement of alosetron was negotiated in confidential meetings with representatives of GlaxoSmithKline. An article published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) noted: \\"By allowing the marketing of alosetron, a drug that poses a serious and significant public health concern according to its own terms, the FDA failed in its mission.\\" Others have argued that the approval process of Lotronex was an example of regulatory capture.

It is often a moist, sweet, cake-like quick bread; however there are some banana bread recipes that are traditional-style raised breads. History Banana bread first became a standard feature of American cookbooks with the popularization of baking soda and baking powder in the 1930s. It appeared in Pillsbury's 1933 Balanced Recipes cookbook, and later gained more acceptance with the release of the original Chiquita Banana's Recipe Book in 1950. National Banana Bread day is February 23. Bananas appeared in the US in the 1870s and it took a while for them to appear as ingredient items for desserts. The modern banana bread recipe began being published in cookbooks around the 1930s and its popularity was greatly helped by the introduction of baking powder on the market. Some food historians believe banana bread was a byproduct of the Great Depression as resourceful housewives did not wish to throw away overripe bananas (as they were still a costly item to purchase), others believe the modern banana bread was developed in corporate kitchens to promote flour and baking soda products. It could also be a combination of both theories, insofar as being developed in a corporate kitchen to promote flour and baking soda products, as well as marketed as a method to make use of overripe bananas.

History Staveley Roundhouse was built to a standard Midland Railway square shed design in 1870 with a central turntable under cover. After 1948 it became known as Barrow Hill so as not to confuse it with the ex-Great Central shed nearby. It was operational from 1870 until 9 February 1991. The last shed foreman was Pete Hodges and the last person to sign on at Barrow Hill was Joe Denston, for the up sidings preparer. The last locomotives to use the shed on its final day of operation were four diesels: Class 58 no. 58 016 came on shed at 11:00; Class 58 no. 58 027 came on shed at 11:30 and coupled up to 58 016; both Class 58s left for Worksop at 11:40; Class 20 nos. 20 197 and 20 073 arrived on shed at 12:00 and both Class 20 locomotives left for Worksop at 12:10, driven by driver Bob Hill. =Code= *Midland Railway: M24 *London Midland & Scottish: 18D *British Railways Eastern region: 41E *British Railways: BH (end of steam, 4 October 1965) Preservation After closure, the building was heavily vandalised. After lobbying of the local council, the building was Grade II listed by the Department of the Environment in February 1991. Following negotiations with the British Railways Property Board, Chesterfield Borough Council became the new owners of the shed and nearby yard on 20 December 1996. The council subsequently granted a recurring maintenance lease to the Barrow Hill Engine Shed Society, who secured and refurbished the site, including renewal of the original 1870 roundhouse glass roof, except for one section. Funding was provided by the council, Derbyshire County Council, the Transport Trust, North Derbyshire Training and Enterprise Council, European Regional Development Fund and the Government SRB fund. The site reopened to the public in July 1998. Today, still retaining its connection to the UK national rail network through Network Rail, it is the home to many preserved British railway locomotives. The Harry Needle Railroad Company also store and maintain a number of operational lease locomotives on site. As well as the main roundhouse building, Barrow Hill is also home to the former Pinxton Signal box. Relocated after closure, it has since been refurbished and fitted out as per a typical day in its last year of use for Network Rail.

A moraine serves as a natural dam for the lake. The lake is located in the town of Truckee, between Interstate 80 to the north and Schallenberger Ridge to the south. The tracks of the Union Pacific Railroad run along Schallenberger Ridge and closely follow the route of the original transcontinental railroad. The historic route of the Lincoln Highway, the first automobile road across America and US 40 follows the northern shoreline, then climbs to Donner Pass from where the entire lake may be viewed. Both the lake and the pass were named after the ill-fated Donner Party, which wintered involuntarily near the lake in 1846. Donner Memorial State Park is on the east end of the lake and provides campsites with access to several different beaches. There are also various hiking trails in the park.  Fishing  The lake's depth has been measured by the California State Lands Commission to be deep at its deepest point. The deepest point is the fallen tree, just off the guard rail on the north side. High water level is above Mean Sea Level. Donner Lake holds some of the biggest Lake Trout in the state. There is also a good population of Rainbow and Brown Trout as well as Kokanee Salmon. Fisherman use downriggers and troll with plugs for Kokanee Salmon and Rainbow Trout in order to catch the trophy sized Lake Trout. During the Spring and Fall season, Lake Trout come to the top to feed and these are the only times of year one has the chance to hook a Laker in shallow water. A public boat ramp operated by the Truckee Donner Recreation & Parks District is available in the northwest corner of Donner Lake. There is a fee charged for boat launching. The lake is open to both power and sail boats. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has developed an advisory for Donner Lake based on mercury and PCBs found in fish caught from this water body. The advisory provides safe eating advice for fish species caught in the body of water.  Recreation  Standing on North East shore, looking across towards Donner Pass Donner Memorial State Park wraps around the East and part of the South shore of the Lake, encompassing Scallenberger Ridge to the south. Summer activities include: camping, picnicking, boating, fishing, water-skiing, wind- surfing, hiking, and mountain biking. Winter activities include cross-country skiing and snowshoeing. The Park features the Pioneer Monument - welcoming visitors year round - which was built to commemorate the Donner Party traveling to California from the east in the mid-19th century. The statue itself is positioned high, which is said to be the depth snow reached during the winter of 1846 when the Donner Party failed to make it over the pass. The North shore of the Lake hosts of public docks for both swimmers and boaters. Every year the town of Truckee hosts the Donner Lake Triathlon which consists of the Sprint Triathlon: swim, bike, run and the International Triathlon: , , run. =Hiking= Hiking through Donner Memorial State Park in the winter. There are roughly of hiking trails inside the Park. Visitors can legally park in Coldstream Canyon (just past the 76 gas station) which contains the alignment of the primary Emigrant Trail, which leads up to U.S. Forest Service and the Pacific Crest trails beyond the park. Donner lake is roughly around which also makes for a great hike. =Camping= There are 154 sites to camp at in the park and a day-use area along the lake. A lakeside interpretive trail has 18 panels which discuss the natural and cultural resources in the local area.

His other interests included morphology of flowering plants, paleobotany, and the flora of the Caucasus. He was born in Shusha. He was one of the most influential taxonomists of the latter twentieth century.  Life  = Family = Armen Takhtajan's father (left) and grandfather (right), appr. 1900 Takhtajan was born in Shusha, Russian Empire, present-day disputed Nagorno-Karabakh, on 10 June 1910, to a family of Armenian intellectuals. His grandfather Meliksan Takhtadzhyan Petrovich had been born in Trabzon, Ottoman Empire and was educated in Italy, on the island of San Lazzaro degli Armeni, an Armenian enclave, spoke many languages and worked as a journalist. He died in Paris in 1930. His father, Leon Meliksanovich Takhtadzhyan (1884‚Äì1950), was born in Batumi, Georgia and was educated as an agronomist at Leipzig University. Graduating in 1906, he worked on farms in France, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, and made a special study of sheep farming. He became proficient in German, French, English, Russian, Georgian and Azerbaijani. Arriving in Shusha in 1908, then a centre of sheep farming in the Caucasus, looking for work, Leon was forced to teach German at the local Realschule attached to the Armenian seminary, due to lack of opportunities in his chosen field. There he met and married Gerseliya Sergeevna Gazarbekyan (1887‚Äì1974), Armen Takhtajan's mother, a native of Susha, in 1909. = Early life and education = The Takhtajans had three children, Armen (1910‚Äì2009), Nellie (1914‚Äì1994) and Nora (1918‚Äì1965). In 1918 the family were forced to flee to northern Armenia because of the pogroms. Throughout his childhood, Armen showed a keen interest in natural history, travelling with his father. Armen attended school in Tbilisi in nearby Georgia, initially at Unified Labor School number 42 (former Mantashevskom commercial school). There he came under the influence of one of his teachers, Alexander Konstantinovich Makaev (Makashvili) (1896‚Äì1962), who had previously taught agriculture at Tbilisi State University, and had produced a dictionary of botanical names in Georgian, Russian and Latin. Makaev would take Armen on botanical excursions, teaching him to identify plants from Sosnowski and Grossheim's \\"Determinants of plant life in the vicinity of Tbilisi\\" (1920). In 1928 he completed secondary school and travelled to Leningrad. There he volunteered at the biology school at Leningrad University and attended lectures by Vladimir Leontyevich Komarov (1869‚Äì1945) on plant morphology. In 1929 he began his studies in biology at Yerevan State University in Yerevan, Armenia, which he completed in 1931. He then returned to Tbilisi, enrolling in the All-Union Institute of Subtropical Crops. In 1932 after completing his course at Tbilisi he worked for a while as a laboratory assistant at Sukhumi, Georgia, at the subtropical branch of the All-Union Institute of Applied Botany and New Crops (now the Institute of Plant Industry), before returning to Yerevan. In Yerevan he took a position as researcher at the Natural History Museum of Armenia, and then at the Herbarium of the Armenian branch of the Institute of Biology, Soviet Academy of Sciences, and began teaching at Yerevan University in 1936, while completing his Master's thesis. He died in Saint Petersburg on November 13, 2009, at the age of 99, in 2009, having just completed his most important work, Flowering Plants.  Work  From 1938-48 he headed a Department at the Yerevan State University, and from 1944-48 was director of the Botanical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Armenian SSR, and Professor of the Leningrad State University. Takhtajan was a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, as well as a foreign associate of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences since 1971. He was also the academician of the Academy of Sciences of the Armenian SSR, the president of the Soviet All-Union Botanical Society (1973) and the International Association for Plant Taxonomy (1975), member of the Finnish Academy of Science and Literature (1971), the German Academy of Naturalists \\"Leopoldina\\" (1972) and other scientific societies. While at the Komarov Botanical Institute in Leningrad in 1940, Takhtajan developed his classification scheme for flowering plants, which emphasized phylogenetic relationships between plants. His system did not become known to botanists in the West until after 1950, and in the late 1950s he began a correspondence and collaboration with the prominent American botanist Arthur Cronquist, whose plant classification scheme was heavily influenced by his collaboration with Takhtajan and other botanists at Komarov. He is chiefly famous as the author of works on the origins of flowering plants and paleobotany, developing a new classification system of higher plants. He worked on the \\"Flora of Armenia\\" (vol. 1‚Äì6, 1954‚Äì73) and \\"Fossil flowering plants of the USSR \\"(v. 1, 1974) books. Takhtajan also developed a system of floristic regions.(Takhtajan, Crovello and Cronquist, 1986) For many years restrictions were placed on his work because of his opposition to the official line on genetics promoted by Lysenko. In 1993 he worked for a while at the New York Botanical Garden. = Takhtajan system = The \\"Takhtajan system\\" of flowering plant classification treats flowering plants as a division (phylum), Magnoliophyta, with two classes, Magnoliopsida (dicots) and Liliopsida (monocots). These two classes are subdivided into subclasses, and then superorders, orders, and families. The Takhtajan system is similar to the Cronquist system, but with somewhat greater complexity at the higher levels. He favors smaller orders and families, to allow character and evolutionary relationships to be more easily grasped. The Takhtajan classification system remains influential; it is used, for example, by the Montr√©al Botanical Garden.

He gained fame on two stages: Hollywood and in air races. Early years Paul Mantz (the name he used throughout his life) was born in Alameda, California, the son of a school principal, and was raised in nearby Redwood City, California. He developed his interest in flying at an early age; as a young boy, his first flight on fabricated canvas wings was aborted when his mother stopped him as he tried to launch off the branch of a tree in his yard. In 1915, at age 12, he attended the Panama Pacific Exposition in San Francisco and witnessed the world-famous Lincoln Beachey make his first ever flight in his new monoplane, the Lincoln Beachey Special. Mantz took his first flying lesson at age 16 using money that he made from driving a hearse during the influenza epidemic of 1919. Although he had accumulated hours towards his private pilot certificate, Mantz quit flying altogether when he witnessed the death of his instructor.Schiller 2003, p. 47. On September 24, 1924, Mantz became a part of a famous aviation event when he lent his car battery to the Douglas World Cruiser that had \\"dead-sticked\\" into a field on its way to San Francisco for a celebration of the world flight. He was invited to join the festivities at Crissy Field where many noted military aviators tried to persuade him to pursue a career in military flying.  U.S. Army air cadet  Mantz applied for admission to the United States Army flight school at March Field, California but was told he needed at least two years of college to be eligible. Apparently resorting to a ruse involving Stanford University stationery, he managed to gain admission with false documents and became a successful cadet. He did not inform officials of his prior flying experience.Dwiggins 1975, p. 46. In 1927, shortly before his graduation at March Field, Mantz was flying solo over the Coachella Valley when he spotted a train heading west over the empty desert floor up the long grade from Indio. He rolled over into a dive, leveled off a few feet above the track and flew head-on towards the train as the engineer repeatedly sounded the whistle. At the last moment Mantz pulled up, did a \\"victory roll\\" and flew away. This sort of dangerous stunt was fairly common during the early era of loosely regulated flying in the 1920s but the train's passengers included ranking officers coming to March Field to participate in the graduation ceremonies and Mantz was subsequently dismissed from the army. His instructor reportedly made it clear to him that he had the makings of an exceptional pilot and encouraged him to continue a career in aviation.  Hollywood stunt pilot  After working briefly in commercial aviation, Mantz went to Hollywood, attracted by the large sums of money movie stunt pilots were making at the time. A main requirement was Associated Motion Picture Pilots (AMPP) membership but that was only gained after employment in the industry. In an effort to gain notoriety, on July 6, 1930 Mantz set a record in flying 46 consecutive outside loops as a part of the dedication ceremonies of the San Mateo airport.Onkst, David H. \\"Hollywood Stunt Pilots.\\" centennialofflight.net, 2003. Retrieved: June 4, 2010. Although he gained recognition as an accomplished pilot, without the AMPP card, he still could not work in Hollywood. However, in 1931, Mantz performed the climactic stunt in The Galloping Ghost which required him to fly down a canyon and just miss a prominent sycamore. Misjudging his approach, Mantz crashed into the tree but the film crew got their shot and he got his AMPP card.Schiller 2003, p. 48. Howard Hughes was among his first clients. After much difficulty finding steady stunt work, he accepted a particularly risky assignment, flying a Curtis-Wright CW-16K through a hangar with less than five feet of clearance off each wingtip for the 1932 film Air Mail. Mantz reportedly treated the challenge as an issue of thorough planning, which set him apart from most of the pilots then flying stunts for the movies. Air Mail was a hit and as word spread about his success in getting through the hangar unscathed, Mantz found more work and his professional ideas about stunt flying were gradually accepted by the studios. United Air Services, Paul's fledgling company at United Airport in Burbank, offered readily available aircraft and pilots, standard rates and insurance to protect producers from the financial risks of accidents and downtime. Mantz's company grew steadily along with the public's fascination with flying as the studios made increasing numbers of aviation related films. His Paul Mantz Air Services air charter company (jokingly christened the Honeymoon Express\\"Paul Mantz: King of the Hollywood Pilots.\\" cineramaadventure.com, April 28, 2010. Retrieved: June 4, 2010.) also flourished and became a favorite among Hollywood stars, many of whom, such as Clark Gable and James Cagney became friends. One of his helicopters appears in the Errol Flynn short documentary film, Cruise of the Zaca (1952), as featured on the 2 disc Special Edition DVD of The Adventures of Robin Hood. Other activities During this period, Mantz carried out a number of \\"mercy\\" flights including transporting a deep sea diver to the Mare Island Navy Yard where a decompression chamber was able to save his life, flying 15 Mexican fishermen to safety after their boat began to break up and assisting 53 trapped firefighters in the Santa Barbara mountain area by dropping supplies. Mantz had to fly low through an inferno in order to make the drop.Schiller 2003, p. 49. After Tom Mix's accident and death, Mantz was also chosen to fly the body of Mix home.Dwiggins 1975, p. 48. In 1937, a few months before she vanished over the western Pacific Ocean, acting as a technical advisor, Mantz tutored Amelia Earhart in long-distance flying and navigation (and had accompanied her as a co-pilot on the aborted first attempt of her world flight). Air racing also became a passion for Mantz in the late-1930s. He entered his Lockheed Orion in the Bendix Trophy transcontinental dash from Los Angeles to Cleveland, placing third in 1938 and 1939. On July 4, 1938, Mantz flew from Wichita to Burbank, California, accompanied by Paramount press agent, pilot, and pulp writer, Edward Churchill, in an attempt to break the speed-dash record. The stunt was part of the promotion for the film Men With Wings. The flight ran into several difficulties. The motor overheated over the Grand Canyon. When they reached Burbank, the landing gear jammed and it took 30 minutes to work it loose, while thousands of spectators looked from the ground and the fuel ran perilously low. Churchill was stricken with carbon monoxide poisoning and had to be treated by a physician after landing.  World War II  During World War II, Mantz enlisted and was commissioned a major (later promoted to lieutenant colonel), serving in the First Motion Picture Unit (FMPU) in California. Following an August 1944 honorable discharge, Mantz purchased a fleet of 475 wartime surplus bombers and fighters (including North American P-51 Mustang fighters) for $55,000 to use in film work. Mantz joked that he had the sixth-largest air force in the world, and sold the fleet's onboard fuel for a profit on his initial investment.\\"Paul Mantz: Race Pilot.\\" air-racing-history.com. Retrieved: June 4, 2010. Retaining only 12 aircraft, the remainder of his \\"air force\\" was sold off as \\"scrap\\" at a handsome profit.Schiller 2003, p. 50.  Racing pilot  With his film fleet in place, Mantz chose one of the P-51 fighters to convert it into a Bendix Trophy racer. With his longtime mechanic, Cort Johnson, he totally rebuilt the P-51C, stripping out all military issue equipment and modifying the wings with \\"wet\\" fuel cells. In the 1946 Bendix Trophy race, all the competitors flew similar converted warbirds but Mantz prevailed with an average speed of 435 mph. He went on to win the Bendix for an unprecedented three consecutive years (1946‚Äì1948) with over $125,000.00 in winnings.Schiller 2003, pp. 50‚Äì51.  Postwar film career  In 1945, Mantz flew a P-40 and directed aerial sequences in God is My Co-Pilot. Mantz piloted a Boeing B-17 for the belly landing scenes in Twelve O'Clock High and the footage was reused in several other movies.There is some debate over the claim that Mantz was at the controls in the Twelve O'Clock High crash-landing sequence, as Frank Tallman has also claimed to be the pilot. -- However this claim is appears to be false. Frank Tallman would have been only 30 years old at the time of the movie (1949), and there is no noted evidence that Frank worked with major motion pictures in Hollywood at this age nor is it felt he would be asked to take on such a feat at 30 when other seasoned and talented pilots had already made names for themselves in Hollywood. His longest single flying assignment was in the late 1950s, for the TV series Sky King. Mantz piloted a converted B-25 bomber to film footage for Cinerama travelogues. According to an interview in the documentary Cinerama Adventure with Mantz's cameraman, in one instance, Mantz flew through an active volcano and narrowly escaped crashing into the mouth of the volcano when the engines died due to oxygen starvation. Mantz's B-25 was outfitted with a refrigerator and other amenities for comfort as he used it for world travel on film assignments. Mantz came up with the idea for filming the opening shot for the 1955 film Bad Day at Black Rock in which an aerial view of an approaching passenger train was filmed in reverse with the consist backing away from the camera helicopter as flying towards the train was too dangerous. The sequence was then reversed in the film. Mantz used his B-25 to film Cinerama sequences of military aircraft at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in October and November 1956, for the Lowell Thomas production, Search for Paradise, released in 1957.Crestview, Florida, \\"Cinerama Crews Shooting New Movie At Eglin AFB\\", The Okaloosa News-Journal ‚Äì Edgewater Area News section, Thursday 1 November 1956, Volume 42, Number 44, page 1. Also, in 1957 he was the behind the scene pilot for the film ‚ÄúThe Spirit of St. Louis.‚Äù So, when you see ‚ÄúLindy‚Äù bouncing the Spirit off the runway trying to will the plane into the air, it‚Äôs Paul Mantz at the stick. In 1961, aged 58, Mantz formed Tallmantz Aviation with pilot Frank Tallman, supplying aircraft along with their personal stunt flying services to movie and television productions. Together they were involved in several hit movies including the outrageous flying sequences performed in an unlikely, Twin Beech, stunt plane in the 1963 slap stick comedy, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Mad Mad Mad Mad World.‚Äù  Family life  In 1932, Mantz married Myrtle \\"Red\\" Harvey, one of his former flying students, but divorced in 1935.Joiner 2007, p. 69. He remarried two years later to Theresa \\"Terry\\" Mae Minor and had a son, Paul, Jr., with his second wife. He adopted her two children by a previous marriage to Roy T. Minor (1904 - 1935), Roy, Jr. and Nita Lou \\"Tenita\\". The Mantz family lived on Balboa Island, off Newport Beach, California, where Mantz had a yacht. After years of successful ventures in both air racing and movie work, he had accumulated more than $10 million in profits, and by 1965, was planning his retirement.Joiner 2007, p. 70. When his partner, Frank Tallman, broke his leg in a freak accident, Mantz stepped in to finish the aerial scenes for one last movie project.Joiner 2007, p. 71.  Death  Mantz died on July 8, 1965 while working on the movie The Flight of the Phoenix, which was produced and directed by Robert Aldrich. Flying a very unusual aircraft, the Tallmantz Phoenix P-1 built especially for the film, Mantz struck a small hillock while skimming over a desert site in Arizona for a second take. As Mantz attempted to recover by opening the throttle to its maximum, the over-stressed aircraft broke in two and nosed over into the ground, killing Mantz instantly. Bobby Rose, a stuntman standing behind Mantz in the cockpit and representing a character played by Hardy Kr√ºger, was seriously injured. The FAA investigation noted Mantz's alcohol consumption before the flight and said the resulting impairment to his \\"efficiency and judgment\\" contributed to the accident. Thirteen years later his business partner, Frank Tallman, also died in an aviation mishap. Some who were with Mantz during the shoot dispute that he was flying under the influence, although they acknowledge he was drinking alcohol the night before the fatal flight. Toxicology tests were performed several hours after the accident; in the absence of refrigeration, normal postmortem biochemical processes might produce blood ethanol and cause or contribute to an elevated BAC level.Boyle, John. \\"Was Paul Mantz's Blood Alcohol Content Really 0.13 When He Flew The Phoenix??\\" Retrieved: February 22, 2011. The final credits of The Flight of the Phoenix bear a tribute to Paul Mantz: \\"It should be remembered ... that Paul Mantz, a fine man and a brilliant flyer gave his life in the making of this film ...\\"The Flight of the Phoenix (1965). 20th Century Fox, DVD re-release, 2003. In the 1988 TV movie Pancho Barnes, Mantz was portrayed by Kurt Rhoads. In Amelia Earhart, a 1976 made-for- television biographical film, he was played by Stephen Macht.

They represent undergraduate students from the University of Alberta, the University of Calgary, the University of Lethbridge, Mount Royal University, and MacEwan University to the public, government and other post-secondary education stakeholders. Based in Edmonton, CAUS is a non-partisan and active advocacy group looking to ensure a fully accessible and high quality system of education in Alberta. History The Council of Alberta University Students (CAUS) was created in 1986 after the disintegration of the Federation of Alberta Students (FAS). FAS was a provincial umbrella organization that represented all of the public post-secondary institutions in Alberta; the organization fell apart in 1981 when a number of colleges and technical institutes withdrew their membership from the organization because they felt that the universities dominated the Federation. Out of the ashes of the FAS emerged CAUS, which included all of the publicly funded universities in Alberta, and ACTISEC (Alberta Colleges and Technical Institutes Student Executive Council), which represented all of the publicly funded colleges and technical institutes and later became the Alberta Students' Executive Council (ASEC). The original purpose of CAUS was to facilitate information sharing and networking between university students' unions and associations. Since then, the emphasis of the organization has gone from being a networking group to an active lobbying and advocacy coalition. In 2014, the student associations of Mount Royal University and MacEwan University became CAUS members, bringing the membership to five out of the six universities in Alberta.

Founded in 1985 in Annapolis, Maryland by Paul Reed Smith, the brand has become renownedPaul Reed Smith Guitars: Luxury Ain't Cheap (But Are They Worth It?) by Robert Allen Johnson on Spinditty.com, April 22, 2016 for their highly figured maple tops, high quality craftsmanship, and innovative guitar designs. Products currently manufactured by PRS include electric & acoustic guitars, basses, and amplifiers. History = Beginning: 1985-1995 = Paul Reed Smith set up a partnership to create a factory in Annapolis, Maryland. and set off work on producing guitars. The company's first outing was for the 1985 NAMM Show where they debuted the PRS Custom. Featuring a mahogany neck set into a mahogany body with a maple cap, a patented vibrato, customized tuning pegs, and custom rotary pickup switching with high quality electronics, the guitar represented influences from both old and new; something striking in the midst of an industry that was producing \\"high tech\\" guitars. \\"I saw Adrian Belew on King Crimson's Beat tour in 1982,\\" says Smith, \\"and the sound he was getting out of his guitar was on another planet somewhere. He let me rebuild his Ibanez Blazer. I put in our whole tuning-peg/bridge system and a new electronic system with an Alembic Stratoblaster pre-amp. It sounded unbelievable. Right then I decided that I wanted to put those sounds on a humbucking guitar, which is when I went back to the rotary switch and redesigned it for humbuckers.\\" After three years the company employed 45 people producing 15 guitars per day. Construction = Hardware = Nuts are synthetic and tuners are of PRS's own design, although some models feature Korean-made Kluson-style tuners. PRS guitars feature three original bridge designs: a one-piece pre-intonated stoptail, a vibrato, and a wrapover tailpiece. The Vibrato was designed with the help of guitar engineer John Mann. It was an update on the classic Fender vibrato and used cam-locking tuners, which offered wide pitch bending with exceptional tuning stability. = Pickups = Tremolo of a PRS Custom 24 teal black Pickups are designed and wound in-house. While most of the pickups are humbuckers, some are actually a pair of single coils wound in opposing directions, one intended for the neck and one for the bridge position. Through the use of a unique rotary pickup selector switch, PRS pickups offer 5 different sounds: a combination of thick humbucking Gibson-like tones, and chimey single-coil Stratocaster-like tones. The standard treble and standard bass pick ups use magnetic pole pieces in the non-adjustable inner coil, and a rear-placed feeder magnet in order to achieve a more authentic single-coil tone when split by the rotary switch. PRS developed pickups for the aggressive rock market, offering pick ups such as the chainsaw, and the Hot-Fat-Screams (HFS) initially used on the Special model. In 1998, an electronic upgrade kit was released for pre-1993 instruments which included lighter-weight tuner buttons, nickel-plated brass screws for saddles and intonation, a simulated tone control, and high-capacitance hookup wire. In 2012, PRS released the 408 pickups used on the 408 and Paul's Guitar models. These pickups include innovations that feature no loss of volume when in coil split mode. They have an exclusive agreement to use wire drawn from the same machine that made wire for Les Paul and Stratocaster pickups in the 1950s. Certain models of PRS Guitars have also used pickups by Lindy Fralin, notably in the EG II and certain specs of the Custom 22.  Models  2011 PRS Studio Model, Made in USA In 1985 Paul Reed Smith started producing factory made guitars, which later on known as PRS Standard. In 1988 Paul Reed Smith introduced its more affordable Bolt-On series known as classic electric(CE models,) which discontinued in 2009. In 2016, the CE line was put back in production. In 1990, PRS EG was introduced as company's first 22-fret guitar. Later on in the more successful 1992 PRS EG II was introduced, which includes PRS's first lefty guitar. In 1992 PRS introduced the Dragon 1 model. Only 50 units were produced. It featured an intricate dragon inlay which ran down the finger board, a wide 22 fret neck, and a non-vibrato Stop-tail bridge and a new pick up design. The changes in design from previous models added a noticeable tonal improvement which led the company to use the same characteristics in later models such as the PRS Custom 22. The Dragon 2 was released in 1993, and the Dragon 3 in 1994. Both featured dragon inlays which became more extreme with every year. Only 100 of each of the 2 models were made. In 1999 PRS released the Dragon 2000, which featured complex body curves, and a 3 dimensional dragon inlay. Just 50 Dragon 2000's were ever produced. In 1994, Paul Reed Smith collaborated with Ted McCarty and launched the \\"McCarty\\" Series. The McCarty series offers a more vintage feeling and sounding PRS Guitar. PRS introduced a more affordable line of guitars in 2000 referred to as the \\"SE\\" which are manufactured in Korea by World Musical Instrument Co. Ltd. for the electrics and Wildwood for the acoustics. PRS produces a large range of models in the SE series including the Custom 24, SE245, SE Kestrel and Kingfisher bass guitars as well as signature guitars such as the Bernie Marsden, Tremonti, Zach Myers and Santana amongst others.PRS They also intro their Singlecut models in 2001. PRS introduces a range of amplifiers and acoustic guitars in 2009. In 2013, PRS added the S2 Series and in February 2018 PRS began producing a Silver Sky model based on two of John Mayer's favourite guitars from the 1960s. In 2019, PRS announced three SE signature models: PRS SE Santana Singlecut Trem, PRS SE Paul's Guitar, and PRS SE Schizoid. Legal challenge In 2001, PRS released their Singlecut model, which resembled the traditional Les Paul. Gibson Guitar Corporation filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against the owner, Paul Reed Smith. An injunction was ordered _Gibson Guitar Corp. v. Paul Reed Smith Guitars, L.P._ , 325 F. Supp. 2d 841 (M.D. Tenn., 2004) that required PRS to stop manufacturing of the Singlecut at the end of 2004. Federal District Court Judge William J. Haynes, then ruled the Singlecut was an imitation of the Gibson Les Paul. However, in 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the lower court decision and ordered the dismissal of Gibson's suit and PRS resumed production. _Gibson Guitar Corp. v. Paul Reed Smith Guitars, LP_ , 423 F.3d 539 (6th Cir. 2005). While no changes to the design of the Singlecut occurred as a result of the lawsuit, some Singlecut owners and sellers have adopted the term 'pre-lawsuit' to differentiate their Singlecut guitar from others. _Gibson Guitar Corp. v.

It covers an area of . From the Maori Waikaremoana translates as 'sea of rippling waters'. The lake lies in the heart of Tuhoe country. The hamlet of Aniwaniwa and the Waikaremoana Holiday Park are located on the lakeshore, along SH38 (from Wai-O-Tapu via Murupara to Wairoa), which connects the lake to the central North Island (Rotorua) and Gisborne. There is a Department of Conservation office at Aniwaniwa. Several walks start here, including a short stroll to Aniwaniwa Falls. The village of Onepoto is located on the lake's southern shores, close to the lake's old overflow channel and the intake of the Waikaremoana hydroelectric power scheme. The name Onepoto means short beach , and refers to the small bay to the north of the village with a beach only 60 metres long.Wises New Zealand Guide, 7th edition 1979 Lake Waikaremoana is a holiday destination for people who use the lake for fishing, tramping and other recreational activities. The Lake Waikaremoana Track, one of New Zealand's \\"Great Walks\\", is a three- to four-day tramp which follows approximately half of the lake's circumference. The track can be walked independently, or as part of a guided group. There are huts dotted on the walk which require booking to use. Camping is permitted unless you are more than 500 metres from the track. The climate of the area is temperate In the summer and cool during the winters, snowfalls occur a few times a year in the region. Numbers of visitors to the area are limited to some extent as a result of the extensive unsealed road that must be taken to reach it. This makes Lake Waikaremoana significantly less congested with tourists than the other nine Great Walks in New Zealand. The smaller Lake Waikareiti lies four kilometres to the northeast. Geography, natural history and climate Waikaremoana, the North Island's deepest lake (256 m deep), has its surface at 600 metres above sea level. A huge landslide dam about 250 metres high formed the lake around 2,200 years ago. Before the landslip was sealed, around 1950, much of the lake outflow flowed through the landslip rather than out of an overflow at a low point in the slip. Other geographical features include Panekiri Bluff and Puketukutuku Peninsula, which is the site of a kiwi- conservation programme. Surrounded by mountains clad with native forest which has never been logged, Waikaremoana is regarded as the North Island's most attractive lake. Many native bird-species scarce in most other parts of the North Island occur in the area. A possum-hunting programme operates in the area to help protect the forest. Numerous understory species grow within the forested area of the catchment basin, crown fern (Lomaria discolor), for example. C. Michael Hogan. 2009 Since at least the early 1900s lake-bottom molluscs have been studied by Colenso (1811-1899) and others.Royal Society of New Zealand. 1905 The climate of Lake Waikaremoana is temperate during the summer months and cool in the winter where snow events are not unheard of. Heavy rains affect the region, especially about late winter and early spring. The weather in the area is very changeable, trampers in the region need to be on the look out for dangerous weather conditions. Hydroelectric power scheme Fisherman on the bank of the lake The Waikaremoana Hydroelectric Power Scheme appears to be the only example of a hydroelectric power station being built on a natural landslide dam. =Modifying the natural dam= The stability of the natural dam has been the subject of intense engineering review, both at the time of construction and subsequently. Construction of an outlet tunnel through the slip, which commenced in 1935, required extensive grouting around the control structures and throughout tunnel construction. Work was suspended at the end of 1936 because Bob Semple, the newly elected Minister for Public Works, wanted the tunnelling project reconsidered for \\"risk, cost and value\\". A new tunnelling scheme was devised in 1941 based on what had been learned from initial exploratory tunnelling and work recommenced in 1943 and continued for about 5 years because of continual problems with dewatering the tunnels. After the tunnels and intake headworks had been completed the natural dam was sealed for leaks on the lake side by removing submerged timber, a task that took a year and then applying 40,000 cubic metres of crushed rock and clay-like pumice in 6 layers, then covering those layers with a top layer of larger rock and spalls to protect the material from wave action. This sealing reduced the natural flow by about 80%. The sealing of the lake was only done after tunnelling was completed otherwise it would have caused the lake level to rise and make tunnelling more difficult. As it was, the lake level had to be lowered by temporary syphons to enable the construction of the headworks and make sealing of the natural dam easier. =Power stations= Although the Waikaretaheke River carries a flow of about 17 m¬≥/s from Lake Waikaremoana, the head of water through the 3 power stations, Kaitawa, Tuai, and Piripaua is around 450 metres, allowing the stations to potentially generate 138 megawatts all up. The 250m head of water for the Kaitawa station is the highest for a dam in New Zealand and among the highest in the world.

It was written by Tom Lazarus and Rick Ramage. Its story follows an atheist hairdresser from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, who is afflicted with the stigmata after acquiring a rosary formerly owned by a deceased Italian priest who himself had suffered from the phenomenon. It stars Patricia Arquette, Gabriel Byrne, Jonathan Pryce, Nia Long, and Rade ≈†erbed≈æija. The film was produced by FHM Entertainment and was released on September 10, 1999. It grossed $18.3 million during its opening weekend and $89.4 million worldwide, against a budget of $29 million. It received generally negative reviews and has a 29% approval rating based on 90 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. Despite its negative reviews, Stigmata more than tripled its budget. Plot In the Brazilian village of Belo Quinto, Father Andrew Kiernan, a former scientist and a Jesuit priest who investigates supposed miracles, examines a statue of the Virgin Mary weeping blood at the funeral of Father Paulo Almeida, who had previously experienced stigmata. While Andrew is collecting evidence, a young boy steals a rosary from the father's hand. The boy later sells it to a woman in a marketplace, who sends it to her daughter, Frankie Paige, living in Pittsburgh. Shortly afterward, Frankie is attacked by an unseen force while bathing, and receives two deep wounds on her wrists. As the wounds are treated, doctors cannot find the cause. Frankie asks a priest if he is Andrew Kiernan, the scientist, priest and investigator. When the priest says he is Father Derning, the lights in the train flash and Frankie is whipped from behind by an unseen force. While Frankie is hospitalized again, the priest sends security tapes showing the attack to the Vatican, and Andrew is sent to investigate. Andrew interviews Frankie, believing her wounds may also be stigmata. When she tells him she is an atheist, Andrew tells her that stigmata is when the deeply devoted are struck with the five wounds that Jesus received during the crucifixion. Frankie begins to research on her own what the cause could be. Her head begins to bleed, the third stigmata wound caused by the Crown of Thorns. Frankie runs home, where Andrew is waiting, and then runs into an alley. As Andrew pursues her, Frankie smashes a glass bottle and uses the shards to carve symbols on the hood of a car: when Andrew approaches her, she yells at him in another language. Andrew takes Frankie to Father Derning's church, and the Vatican translates what she was yelling in Aramaic. The next morning, Andrew returns to her apartment to find her writing on the wall, now covered in Aramaic. Frankie talks in a male voice, speaking Italian. Wounds appear in her feet, the fourth wound of stigmata. Andrew emails photographs of Frankie's apartment wall to the Vatican, where Brother Delmonico recognizes the words and deletes the pictures. He tells Andrew the words are from a document the church found that looked to be an entirely new gospel. Father Dario shows the pictures to Cardinal Daniel Houseman, who also recognizes them. Delmonico phones Marion Petrocelli and tells him the missing gospel has been found in Pittsburgh. Andrew goes to Frankie's apartment to find the wall she wrote on painted over, and Frankie attempts to seduce him. When Andrew rejects her, she attacks him and denounces his beliefs in a male voice, ending with Frankie levitating off the bed, crying tears of blood. Houseman and Dario arrive with Derning and take Frankie to another church, sending Andrew to Derning's. At Derning's church, Andrew meets Petrocelli, who tells him the words Frankie has been writing are part of a document found outside Jerusalem they believed to be a gospel in the exact words of Jesus. Petrocelli, Delmonico and Alameida were assigned to translate it, but Houseman ordered them to stop. Alameida refused and stole the document to continue translating it alone, having been excommunicated by Houseman. Petrocelli tells Andrew that the document was Jesus telling his disciples that the Kingdom of God is in all of us and not confined to churches. Petrocelli tells Andrew that Alameida suffered from stigmata. Andrew races to the church where Frankie is, while Houseman and Dario attempt to perform an exorcism on Frankie. Frankie shouts at them in a male voice, and Houseman attempts to strangle her. Andrew stops him, and the room is set on fire. Now believing Frankie is possessed by Alameida's spirit, Andrew offers to be Alameida's messenger instead. He walks unharmed through the fire to retrieve Frankie, bidding Alameida's spirit to depart in peace. Some time later, Andrew returns to Belo Quinto and finds the original documents for the lost gospel in Alameida's church. Text describes the discovery of the Gospel of Thomas, stating that the Catholic Church refuses to recognize the document as a gospel and considers it heresy.

She served in the House of Representatives from 1946 to 1949, the second woman after Enid Lyons to do so. Blackburn was a prominent socialist and originally a member of the Labor Party. She was married to Maurice Blackburn, a Labor MP, but he was expelled from the party in 1937 and she resigned from the party in solidarity. Her husband died in 1944, and she was elected to his former seat at the 1946 federal election ‚Äì the first woman elected to parliament as an independent. However, Blackburn served only a single term before being defeated. She later served as president of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. Early life Born in Hawthorn, Melbourne, Victoria to Lebbeus Hordern, estate agent, and his wife Louisa Dewson (n√©e Smith), Doris Hordern became involved in women's rights and peace issues from a young age and served as the campaign secretary of Vida Goldstein, the first woman to stand for election to federal parliament in Australia. She married Maurice Blackburn, a fellow firebrand socialist, in Melbourne on 10 December 1914 and spent their honeymoon organising anti-war and anti-conscription campaigns. Politics While her husband served at different times as an Australian Labor Party (ALP) member of the Victorian and Federal parliaments, Blackburn continued to work on social issues, some of which brought her into conflict with the Labor Party (of which she too was a member) and following Maurice's expulsion from the party in 1937, she resigned from the ALP. Her husband continued to sit in parliament as an independent but lost his seat at the 1943 federal election to the official Labor candidate, and died the following year. Published in hardcopy in Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 7, (MUP), 1979. Parliament Upset at Labor's treatment of her husband, Doris stood as an Independent Labour candidate for Maurice's old seat of Bourke at the 1946 election, and by winning it she became only the second woman to be elected to the Australian House of Representatives. In parliament Blackburn, who shared the cross benches with fellow former Labor member Jack Lang, championed similar issues to those of her late husband, gaining nationwide notoriety in 1947 as the only MP to vote against the Atomic Energy Bill. She served as the national President of the Council for Civil Liberties. Following an electoral redistribution, her seat of Bourke was abolished, and at the 1949 election she contested the newly established seat of Wills. In a contest with both the Labor and Liberal parties she came third with 20 percent. Standing in Wills again at the 1951 election she also came third with 17 percent of the vote. Both times the seat was convincingly won by Labor. Affiliations She was, in September 1949, a charter member of the Australian Peace Council. Blackburn subsequently remained active in social issues, serving as president of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. Realising the problems faced by Aborigines, following a visit to the Woomera Rocket Range, she co- founded, with Douglas Nicholls, the Aborigines Advancement League and the Federal Council for Aboriginal Advancement. Published in hardcopy in Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 13, (MUP), 1993 Death Blackburn died on 12 December 1970 in Coburg, Victoria, aged 81, survived by her two sons and one of her two daughters.

It is on the Chiltern Main Line between West Ruislip and . History A 1914 Railway Clearing House map showing (upper left) railways in and around Denham The station was built just north of Denham village as part of the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway. Its original name was Denham ‚Äî Junction for Uxbridge as it was a stop on the shuttle service between and ; the latter station has long been closed and demolished, and the branch line to it dismantled. The original station layout had four roads: two for non-stop trains, and two with platforms for stopping services. There was a small goods yard north of the line, and a signal box at the London end of the \\"down\\" platform. The two through roads have been removed, being taken up in December 1965, with all services using the platform roads and has since had improved track alignments to allow fast running trains. The signal box closed on 15 June 1975. The former goods yard is now the station car park. The station was transferred from the Western Region of British Rail to the London Midland Region on 24 March 1974. =Abandoned Central line Extension= Under the London Passenger Transport Board's 1935-40 New Works Programme, Denham was to have been the terminus of the Central line's westward extension, with Central line platforms south of those on the main line. Work on the extension was postponed in World War II. The introduction of the Metropolitan Green Belt limited the expansion of the London urban area and the extension was cut back to West Ruislip. No visible signs of the extension works remain at Denham. =Development= The station was built with a pedestrian underpass linking the platforms, but this was inaccessible to people with impaired mobility. Further, the embankment supporting the \\"down\\" (westbound) platform and buildings was subsiding, so the \\"down\\" platform has been relocated as an island north of the \\"down\\" road, in the gap left by the removal of the original through roads, and to provide a footbridge and lifts, similar to those at Gerrards Cross, for disabled access.

Strickland had been acting as informal legal counsel to another student who had been denied fraternity membership due to the presumption that he was gay. When Strickland became aware of other examples of this, he began organizing a fraternity with a more welcoming model. The fraternity was incorporated in D.C. on September 10, 1987. In April, 1988 a group of gay men at UCLA were recognized as the first Delta Lambda Phi chapter to be affiliated with a university.Gordon, Larry (1 April 1988). \\"Gay Fraternity Wins Recognition From UCLA\\". Los Angeles Times.  Membership  Delta Lambda Phi's membership is open to all men whether they are gay, bisexual, transgender, or straight. There are three types of chapters: campus-based, multi-campus based, and community based. Campus and multi-campus chapters are generally open to male college-aged students who live in the area. Community-based chapters do not require their members to be students. Delta Lambda Phi strictly prohibits hazing, and it adheres to an extensive, fraternity-wide Risk Management Policy. Delta Lambda Phi has been a member of the North American Interfraternity Conference (NIC) since 2013. The fraternity was the first (and as of 2013 only) cultural interest fraternity for gay, bisexual, transgender, and progressive men.  Purposes  The three purposes of the fraternity are: * To develop dignified and purposeful social, service, and recreational activities for all men, irrespective of sexual orientation or gender expression; * To lead in determining the rights and privileges of individuals in society; and, * To present a strong and positive image which respects the diversity of all individuals.  Symbols and traditions  The heraldic crest of Delta Lambda Phi contains eleven symbolic elements, each of which carries a special meaning.\\"Information. Delta Lambda Phi - Kent State Chapter. Archived from the original on 22 January 2003\\". The fraternity's mascot is the Lambda Centaur, which is modeled after Chiron, the only immortal centaur from Greek mythology who was regarded as gentle and wise. The fraternity's colors are green and gold, although white does appear in reference to the fraternity's alumni members. The fraternity flower is the yellow rose. The fraternity's song, \\"Delta Phi\\", has two distinct melodies. The first is a somber ceremonial version, while the second is a festive toast version. Both versions utilize the same set of lyrics. The official song has three verses, but every chapter writes a unique fourth verse to commemorate the founding of their individual chapter. The formal motto of the fraternity is \\"Lambda Men are Making Their Presence Make A Difference.\\"\\"Background and history of Delta Lambda Phi\\". The highest honor bestowed by Delta Lambda Phi is the Vernon L. Strickland III Founder's Award for extraordinary service to the fraternity's brotherhood.  Structure and policies  =Convention = Delta Lambda Phi is governed by its Convention, which is officially the highest authority in the fraternity. The Convention is held annually and, as a body, comprises two members from every active chapter, as well as alumni representatives and the fraternity's Board of Directors. The first Convention was held in 1989 in San Francisco, California. The location of the Convention changes from year to year and is selected by the fraternity staff. = Board of Directors = The fraternity's Board of Directors (BOD) governs the fraternity between conventions and consists of eleven elected members, three ex officio members, and Life Members. The Executive Director (ED) and General Counsel are appointed by the Trustee and confirmed by the Board of Directors. The ED's principal responsibility is to direct the day-to-day affairs of the fraternity. Members who have served the on the Board for ten or more years can be appointed \\"Life Member of the Board\\" by action of the Annual Convention. The fraternity recognizes three broad geographic regions‚ÄîEastern, Central, and Western. Each region is overseen by a regional steering committee, and also hosts two regional conferences; one in the spring, and one in the fall.

The policy governing these relationships is the Corporate Brother-Pledge Relations Policy, known informally as the \\"Hands-Off Policy\\". The policy has existed in various forms since the early years of the fraternity, and it was codified and adopted by the DLP National Convention in 1998. Many chapters also adopt their own local hands-off policy consistent with the corporate policy, often intended to expand or clarify it. The Corporate Brother-Pledge Relations Policy states that brothers and pledges may not engage in \\"extra-fraternal relations\\" during the course of the rush and pledge education periods. The policy aims to ensure that bid distribution remains fair, that pledge education is focused on platonic fraternal bonding, and that the risk of sexual harassment is minimized.O'Callaghan, Erin (20 January 2011). \\"Fraternity for gay students to recruit new members\\". McGill Daily. Retrieved 4 December 2013. No corporate policy exists prohibiting two members from engaging in extra-fraternal relations after they have both become brothers.

The state park is located along the Snake River, southwest of American Falls, in Power County, Idaho. Description The park features a configuration of boulders along the south bank of the Snake River, known alternatively as Massacre Rocks, \\"Gate of Death\\", or \\"Devil's Gate\\". Emigrants gave this name to the narrow passage of the trail through the rocks, from the fear of possible ambush by Native Americans. According to diaries of emigrants, settlers in five wagons clashed with Shoshone just east of the rocks on August 9-10, 1862. Ten emigrants died in the fight, which involved four wagon trains. The skirmishes took place east of the park and not at Devil's Gate as commonly believed. Some confrontations may have occurred there, but they remain unverified. The Clark Massacre of 1851 occurred just west of Massacre Rocks, closer to the Raft River. The rocks were often used as campsite for wagon trains along the trail. Many emigrants carved their names and dates on Register Rock, which is now protected by a shelter. The actual passage through the rocks is now the route of Interstate 86 along the south edge of the park. Boulders deposited during the Bonneville Flood Geologically, the park was created during the repeated volcanic activity on the Snake River Plain. The rocks themselves were deposited in their present location at the end of the last ice age, approximately 14,500 years ago, during the catastrophic flood known as the Bonneville Flood, when much of Lake Bonneville surged down the Snake River. A notch in the cliff on the north bank of the Snake opposite the park was the site of an ancient waterfall of a side channel of the waters in the aftermath of the flood. Massacre Rocks became a state park in 1967, following earlier status as a roadside park managed by the Idaho Department of Transportation. Wildlife This state park is home to various birds which are Canada goose, great blue heron, grebe, pelican, bald eagle. The only residential mammals are beaver, jackrabbit, cottontail, muskrat and coyote. Activities and amenities The park is accessible by automobile on Interstate 86 and by foot using a trail from the rest areas just east of the park on Interstate 86. The footpaths also provide access to remnants of the original Oregon Trail on the south side of the highway. Exhibits in the park's visitor center describe the history and geology of the park. The park offers trails for hiking and biking, disc golf course, campground, and access to the Snake River.

Ajami (; September 18, 1945 ‚Äì June 22, 2014) was a MacArthur Fellowship winning, Lebanese-born American university professor and writer on Middle Eastern issues. He was a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. Ajami was an outspoken supporter of the Bush Doctrine and the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which he believed to have been a \\"noble war\\" and a \\"gift\\" to the people of Iraq., p. xii Personal Ajami was born in Arnoun, a rocky hamlet in the south of Lebanon into a Shia Muslim family. His Shia great-grandfather had come to Arnoun from Tabriz, Iran in the 1850s. In Arabic, the word \\"Ajam\\" means \\"non-Arab\\" or \\"non-Arabic-speaker\\"; specifically in this context, it means \\"Persian\\" or \\"Persian-speaker.\\"Sakhr: Multilingual Dictionary Ajami arrived in the United States in the fall of 1963, just before he turned 18. He did some of his undergraduate work at Eastern Oregon State College (now Eastern Oregon University) in La Grande, Oregon. He did his graduate work at the University of Washington, where he wrote his thesis on international relations and world government, and earned a PhD. Career =Academia= In 1973 Ajami joined the politics department of Princeton University. He made a name for himself there as a vocal supporter of Palestinian self-determination. In 1980, the School of Advanced International Studies of Johns Hopkins University named him director of Middle East Studies. He joined the Hoover Institution in 2011. =Government= Ajami was an advisor to United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as well as a friend and colleague of Paul Wolfowitz.Adam Shatz, \\"The Native Informant\\", The Nation, April 10, 2003. =Journalism= Ajami was a frequent contributor on Middle Eastern issues and contemporary international history to The New York Times Book Review, Foreign Affairs, The New Republic, The Wall Street Journal, as well as other journals and periodicals. He was also a contributor and close friend to Anderson Cooper of CNN.He was also a frequent guest on Fox News Channel's \\"America's News Headquarters w/ Uma Pemmaraju\\" =Television= Ajami frequently appeared on PBS, CBS, CNN and Fox News. Books In \\"The Fate of Nonalignment,\\" an essay in the Winter 1980/81 issue of the journal Foreign Affairs, Ajami outlined how the third world has fared in a context of nonalignment in post Cold war politics. In 1980, he accepted an offer from Johns Hopkins University to become director of Middle East Studies at their international relations graduate program in Washington, D.C.: the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS). He holds an endowed chair as the Majid Khadduri professor. A year after arriving at SAIS, Ajami published his first book, The Arab Predicament, which analyzed what Ajami described as an intellectual and political crisis that swept the Arab world following its defeat by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War. Subsequently, Ajami has written several other books: The Dream Palace of the Arabs: A Generation's Odyssey (1998), Beirut: City of Regrets (1988), and The Vanished Imam: Musa Al-Sadr and the Shia of Lebanon (1986). In The Dream Palace of the Arabs: A Generation's Odyssey, Ajami surveyed the intellectual landscape in the Arab world and Iran, in what was in some ways an autobiography as well as a sequel to \\"The Arab Predicament.\\" On Middle Eastern politics, he wrote of \\"a world where triumph rarely comes with mercy or moderation.\\" On Pan-Arabism, he described the ideology as \\"Sunni dominion dressed in secular garb.\\" Ajami's most recent book: The Foreigner's Gift: The Americans, The Arabs and The Iraqis in Iraq (2006), is about the American invasion of Iraq. Philosophy =View of Huntington's \\"Clash of Civilizations\\"= One notable contribution Ajami made in the September October 1993 issue of Foreign Affairs was a rebuttal to Samuel Huntington‚Äôs \\"The Clash of Civilizations?\\", regarding the state and future of international relations after the Cold War. According to Judith Miller, Ajami continued to argue that militant Islamism of the type represented by Al Qaeda had peaked and was fading into insignificance. Huntington presents a world divided at the highest level into eight civilizations, and includes a number of countries that are \\"torn\\" between two civilizations, arguing that these civilizational divides are far more fundamental than economic interests, ideology, and regimes, and that the world is becoming a smaller place with increasingly close interactions. He further claims that the pre-eminence of a so-called \\"kin-country\\" syndrome will provide a civilizational rallying point that will replace political ideology and traditional \\"balance of power\\" considerations for relations between states and nations, resulting in a division between the West and \\"the rest\\" creating a backlash against Western values (which supposedly \\"differ fundamentally\\" from those prevalent in other civilizations). In his article \\"The Summoning\\", Ajami criticises Huntington for ignoring the empirical complexities and state interests which drive conflicts in and between civilizations. Ajami believes that states will remain the dominant factor influencing the global framework and interaction. He also argues that civilizational ties are only utilized by states and groups when it is in their best interest to do so and that modernity and secularism are here to stay, especially in places with considerable struggles to obtain them, and he cites the example of the Indian middle class. Ajami also believes that civilizations do not control states; rather, states control civilizations. Ajami later relented on his initial criticism of Huntington's theories in the January 6, 2008 issue of the New York Times Book Review in an article titled \\"The Clash\\" in which he wrote that \\"Huntington‚Äôs thesis about a civilizational clash seems more compelling to me than the critique I provided at that time.\\" =Support for Iraq War= Ajami was an outspoken supporter of the Iraq War, which he believed ‚Äúissued out of a deep American frustration... with the culture of terrorism that had put down roots in Arab lands.\\" In an August 2002 speech before the Veterans of Foreign Wars, US Vice President Dick Cheney sought to assuage concerns about the anticipated US invasion of Iraq, stating: \\"As for the reaction of the Arab 'street,' the Middle East expert Professor Fouad Ajami predicts that after liberation, the streets in Basra and Baghdad are 'sure to erupt in joy in the same way the throngs in Kabul greeted the Americans.'\\"The White House, Office of the Press Secretary, August 26, 2002. Ajami cautioned the United States about the likely negative consequences of the Iraq War. In a 2003 essay in Foreign Affairs, \\"Iraq and the Arabs' Future,\\" Ajami wrote, > There should be no illusions about the sort of Arab landscape that America > is destined to find if, or when, it embarks on a war against the Iraqi > regime. There would be no \\"hearts and minds\\" to be won in the Arab world, no > public diplomacy that would convince the overwhelming majority of Arabs that > this war would be a just war. An American expedition in the wake of thwarted > UN inspections would be seen by the vast majority of Arabs as an imperial > reach into their world, a favor to Israel, or a way for the United States to > secure control over Iraq's oil. No hearing would be given to the great > foreign power.Ajami, Fouad. Foreign Affairs January/February 2003. But he also goes on to say: > America ought to be able to live with this distrust and discount a good deal > of this anti-Americanism as the \\"road rage\\" of a thwarted Arab world ‚Äì the > congenital condition of a culture yet to take full responsibility for its > self-inflicted wounds. There is no need to pay excessive deference to the > political pieties and givens of the region. Indeed, this is one of those > settings where a reforming foreign power's simpler guidelines offer a better > way than the region's age-old prohibitions and defects. Ajami retained a positive view of the war three years later. In a 2006 book on the invasion and its aftermath, he described it as a noble effort, and argued that despite many unhappy consequences, it was too soon to write it off as a failure., p. xi Vice President Cheney cited Ajami again in an October 21, 2007 speech to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, stating, \\"We have no illusions about the road ahead. As Fouad Ajami said recently, Iraq is not yet 'a country at peace, and all its furies have not burned out, but a measure of order has begun to stick on the ground.'\\"The White House, Office of the Press Secretary, October 27, 2007. Eight days after U.S. President Barack Obama took office, a Wall Street Journal op-ed piece by Ajami called Obama a \\"messenger of the old, settled ways,\\" claimed that the George W. Bush administration's diplomacy had had \\"revolutionary impact,\\" and chided Obama for not praising the Iraq War.\\"The irony now is obvious: George W. Bush as a force for emancipation in Muslim lands, and Barack Hussein Obama as a messenger of the old, settled ways.\\" \\"Mr. Obama could still acknowledge the revolutionary impact of his predecessor's diplomacy, but so far he has chosen not to do so.\\" \\"Granted, Iraq was not his cause, but a project that has taken so much American toil and sacrifice, that has laid the foundations of a binational (Arab and Kurdish) state in the very heart of an Arab world otherwise given to a despotic political tradition, surely could have elicited a word or two of praise.\\" \\"Obama Tells Arabia's Despots They're Safe\\" By FOUAD AJAMI January 28, 2009 The Wall Street Journal, page A15 Ajami credited the Egyptian Revolution and Tunisian revolution to the Iraq War and Bush's advocacy of democracy: He also stated, however, that In June 2011, Ajami wrote an article for The New Republic arguing that the U.S. troops should remain in Iraq, writing that \\"the United States will have to be prepared for and accept the losses and adversity that are an integral part of staying on, rightly, in so tangled and difficult a setting.\\"Ajami, Fouad (June 1, 2011) Robert Gates Is Right About Iraq, The New Republic On June 13, 2011 he wrote in the Wall Street Journal about the unrest in Syria that \\"The mask of the Assad regime finally falls...\\" Death On June 22, 2014, Ajami died from prostate cancer at a summer home in Maine, aged 68.https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/23/us/fouad-ajami-is-dead- at-68-expert-in-arab-history.html?_r=0https://www.wsj.com/articles/fouad- ajami-great-american-1403564092 Awards Ajami was a 1982 winner of a five- year MacArthur Prize Fellowship in the arts and sciences.

Zack later appears in the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII works Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII, Last Order: Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children and, most significantly, Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII, a prequel to the original game of which he is the main character, and which expands greatly on his personality and backstory. Although Zack is already dead at the start of Final Fantasy VII, is rarely mentioned and only appears late into the story via flashbacks, he is a crucial part of the game's story, as Cloud Strife, the main character, unknowingly confused parts of his own past with Zack's following traumatic events involving the two and Sephiroth; while Cloud originally believes himself to be member of the paramilitary organization SOLDIER, the military wing of the megacorporation Shinra, that story was in fact that of Zack, with Cloud being his friend and a regular soldier. Zack died in the weeks leading up to the opening of Final Fantasy VII, to protect Cloud from Shinra's army after they had escaped from imprisonment. Zack was not originally a part of Final Fantasy VIIs story during development. However, scenario writer Kazushige Nojima wanted to bring a sense of mystery to the title, and created the character to help complicate Cloud's backstory. He was designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and his last name is derived from \\"fair weather,\\" to contrast with Cloud's last name, Strife. With Zack's conceptual backstory in place for Final Fantasy VII, the staff decided to use Compilation of Final Fantasy VII to expand upon his character. Zack is voiced by Kenichi Suzumura in Japanese and Rick Gomez in English. Suzumura was chosen specifically by Nomura for his voice, and was given the role without an audition. Western critics have praised Zack's character, commenting on his development since Final Fantasy VII. Concept and creation Zack did not exist in the original scenario of Final Fantasy VII, but was created only when scenario writer Kazushige Nojima decided to add some mystery to the plot, most notably in relation to Cloud Strife's background. Nojima had always planned for Cloud Strife's memories of his life to be proven false as the game went on, but he had not decided on how to implement this until he hit on the character of Zack. Nojima also used Zack to link Cloud and Aerith Gainsborough, as Aerith had seen something of Zack in Cloud. Zack was the first person Aerith loved, thus creating an emotional connection between herself and Cloud, because he reminds her of him. Originally, the role of her first love was to have been fulfilled by the game's antagonist Sephiroth. As the game continued in its development, Nojima worked out the mysteries regarding Zack and Cloud, which led to some of the scenes in the game needing revision. Director Yoshinori Kitase was surprised by the revelation of Cloud's and Zack's connection, as until the later stages of development, even he did not know about Zack. Character designer Tetsuya Nomura got the request to design Zack when Final Fantasy VII was reaching the end of development. Prior to the late addition of Zack, Nojima had asked the staff to add details to some scenes so as to give clues about him, despite the fact that he did not reveal to the staff Zack's existence until later. For Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, Zack made only a couple of brief appearances, and as such, was not difficult to animate; the team had also acquired his design early in production, allowing modeling of his character to be taken care of. Nomura had wanted Zack to have a \\"nice, upbeat voice,\\" which influenced his decision to cast Kenichi Suzumura. Beforehand, Nomura had had dinner with Suzumura, where he had decided that \\"at that point [Nomura] wanted him to be in one of his projects if the opportunity ever presented itself.\\" Suzumura was offered the role without an audition. Nomura explained that, because Zack had been chosen to be the lead in Last Order: Final Fantasy VII, he needed \\"someone who could handle [the] role well.\\" The staff used Last Order as an opportunity to portray Zack \\"properly\\" as a \\"handsome, light-hearted man [who] was in everyone's memory.\\" In English, Zack is voiced by Rick Gomez. In an interview with IGN whilst promoting Crisis Core, Yoshinori Kitase explained that when the original game was created, \\"Zack was a rather minor character,\\" although Nomura had created art design, and Nojima had created a \\"basic concept of [Zack's] story.\\" Kitase further explained that \\"you could say that the idea [for the storyline of Crisis Core] has been cooking for 10 years.\\" Before Crisis Core began development, the staff had planned to create a PlayStation Portable port of Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII, but soon changed their minds to create a game that focused on Zack, whose fate was already predetermined; fans knew how the game was going to end. Throughout the game, the staff decided to use a blue sky in cutscenes to represent Zack, while other features in such scenes are meant to symbolize his connections. A number of Zack's actions from the game were also designed so as to augment the similarities that Aerith finds between him and Cloud in Final Fantasy VII. Due to Zack initially appearing as a younger person than the one seen in previous games, Suzumura was asked to portray Zack in a fashion that shows him naive in order for his character arc being more noticeable as Zack becomes more mature in the narrative of Crisis Core. He wears the SOLDIER 1st class uniform, consisting of a black, sleeveless turtleneck, black boots, and armor. In Crisis Core, Zack has two attires; his Final Fantasy VII outfit and a different outfit worn during the start of the game, which he changes after fighting Angeal Hewley. Originally, Zack was meant to wear red clothing until Tetsuya Nomura drew his black outfit. He was made as a conventional heroic character in contrast to Cloud who was written as an unlikely hero. There was an attempt to make Zack's and Aerith's interactions appealing in Crisis Core. Zack's full name was first revealed in an article in Dengeki PlayStation. Nomura stated that Zack's name was derived from 'fair weather' and specifically chosen because it contrasted with Cloud Strife's name. Zack and Cloud's connection was also meant to be expanded upon near the game's ending, with both of them planning to flee to Midgar. However, due to limitations in the console's hardware, these scenes could not be implemented, and instead, they decided to focus on Zack's role as a warrior. Appearances Zack had only a small role in the original Final Fantasy VII. He is first mentioned by name in Gongaga, his hometown, where his parents are oblivious as to what became of him after he left to join SOLDIER, and are worried for his safety after not hearing from him for years. It is at this point that Aerith explains Zack was her first love. Cloud later realizes that some of his memories and even aspects of his personality were actually Zack's, and not his own. Flashbacks reveal that both Zack and Cloud battled Sephiroth after he burned the town of Nibelheim upon discovering he was the result of a scientific experiment. After Cloud defeated Sephiroth, both Zack and Cloud were taken to be used in experiments by Shinra. Eventually, Zack woke up and was able to escape with a semi-conscious Cloud to the city Midgar, but on the edge of the city, he was gunned down by Shinra troops. While Zack's and Cloud's flashback escape is optional in the North American and European releases of Final Fantasy VII and the Japanese International version, it was originally planned to be shown once Cloud discovered the results of Shinra's experiments. Zack's character and backstory is expanded upon throughout the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII. In the prequel game Before Crisis, Zack supports Shinra in their fight against the eco-terrorist group AVALANCHE. During the game, two of his SOLDIER acquaintances are captured and experimented upon, and though Zack is able to bring them back to their senses, he is unable to save them. Zack also makes an appearance during the chapter covering the Nibelheim incident, and later as a boss character when he and Cloud are fugitives from Shinra and are being pursued by the Turks. The OVA Last Order: Final Fantasy VII follows Zack and Cloud's journey to Midgar with flashbacks of the Nibelheim incident. Zack also has a small role in the film sequel Advent Children, where most of his appearances are flashbacks from Cloud's point of view. He also appears at the end of the film, where he and the now deceased Aerith speak to Cloud. In the director's cut version, Advent Children Complete, his role is expanded, and he makes an appearance during Cloud's battle with Sephiroth. His death is also shown in the film, where he gives Cloud the Buster Sword and tells him to become his \\"living legacy\\". Zack is the protagonist of Crisis Core, a prequel to Final Fantasy VII, which deals primarily with Zack's backstory. In the game, Zack is trained as a SOLDIER by his close friend, Angeal Hewley, and hopes to become a hero while working for Shinra. When Angeal, and another SOLDIER, Genesis Rhapsodos, betray Shinra, Zack and Sephiroth are dispatched to kill them, but they decide to avoid doing that if possible. He and Sephiroth learn that both Angeal and Genesis were the result of a Shinra experiment called \\"Project G\\", where they were injected with Jenova cells prior to being born in an effort to create perfect SOLDIERs. However, both Angeal and Genesis are suffering from secondary effects which led them to antagonize Shinra in the hopes of finding a cure. In the course of the game, Zack befriends Cloud and begins dating Aerith. During a mission to find Angeal and Genesis, Angeal forces Zack to kill him, as he wants to stop hurting people because of his mutations. Before dying, Angeal thanks Zack for stopping him and gives him his Buster Sword. Later, while Zack and Sephiroth search for Genesis and the former Shinra scientist Dr. Hollander, they go to Nibelheim where Sephiroth learns that he too was the result of genetic experimentation involving Jenova. The game then depicts the Nibelheim incident, leading to Zack and Cloud being taken captive and subjected to experiments themselves. Four years pass, Zack and Cloud are able to escape, and Zack learns that Genesis has come to believe the only way he can be cured is by being injected with Sephiroth's cells. As Sephiroth is thought dead, the only source of these cells is now Cloud, and Zack realises that Genesis plans to kill Cloud. Zack decides to stop Genesis, and after defeating him, he and Cloud head to Midgar, where he hopes to be reunited with Aerith. However, Zack and Cloud are intercepted by Shinra infantry, and Zack is killed. In his dying breath, Zack gives the Buster Sword to Cloud, telling him to be his living legacy. As Cloud stumbles off towards Midgar, Zack is pulled into the sky by Angeal, and wonders if he has become a hero. Zack has served as the basis for several forms of merchandise, such as being pictured on the Final Fantasy VII 10th Anniversary Potion soft drink cans. Outside the Final Fantasy VII series, Zack is an unlockable character in the PlayStation version of the fighting game Ehrgeiz, where is playable in arcade, versus, and minigame events. He made his debut appearance in the Kingdom Hearts series in the prequel Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep for the PlayStation Portable, where he has a more youthful appearance than in his Final Fantasy incarnation. He is featured prominently in the Olympus Coliseum, commonly participating in tournaments in order to achieve his dream of becoming a hero. As the game is a prequel to the other Kingdom Hearts titles, the staff chose him as they wanted a character from a Final Fantasy prequel. Zack appears at the end of Final Fantasy VII Remake, where he survives the ambush by Shinra forces and continues dragging Cloud toward Midgar. It is implied that the scene takes place in another timeline from the main narrative. Reception Critical response to Zack's character has generally been positive. In IGN's 2008 list of Final Fantasy VII top ten characters list, Zack made sixth place, with IGN's Dave Smith noting that \\"his check-out scene in Crisis Core is just about as epic as it gets in videogames.\\" In 2010, Famitsu readers voted Zack as the 37th most popular video game character in Japan. GamesRadar's Jim Sterling found Zack to be one of video game's most sexually appealing male characters due to his personality and look. In 2013, Complex ranked Zack as the 18th greatest Final Fantasy character of all time, as well as the sixth greatest soldier in video games.Chad Hunter, Michael Rougeau, The 50 Greatest Soldiers In Video Games, Complex.com, May 25, 2013. In a survey, Zack was voted as the 16th best character voiced by Suzumura. Zack's role in Crisis Core has received a mainly positive reaction. IGN's Ryan Clements particularly praised Zack's relationships with the other main characters. 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish agreed with Clements, arguing that Zack's story contrasted with other RPG plots, calling it \\"the heart of the game.\\" Kevin VanOrd from GameSpot labelled Zack a \\"likable and complex hero,\\" arguing that he \\"transcends the usual spiky-haired heroism and teenage angst with an uncommon maturity that develops as the game continues.\\" GameSpy's Gerald Villoria described Zack as \\"King of the Nice Guys,\\" noting that even though he can be a \\"pretty hate-worthy character if you're the jaded type who mocks the typical Final Fantasy storyline,\\" players who dislike him could come to appreciate him. Zack was also called an \\"endearing main character\\" by Game Revolution who stated that despite what the character goes through during the game, he still retains his friendly attitude. Like other reviewers, RPGamer viewed him to have the \\"full, soulful carriage of a Final Fantasy hero\\" due to his personal conflicts, despite his \\"artfully teased hair and devil-may-care grin.\\" Although Eurogamer's Simon Parkin found Zack's physical appearance to be highly similar to Cloud's, he added that \\"this fan service doesn't put a foot wrong until he reaches into his [Zack's] pocket, pulls out a mobile phone and speaks.\\" He also praised Zack's English voice actor for doing a good job, noting \\"his character's maturing and developing over the 15-hour storyline.\\" IGN AU's Patrick Kolan agreed, calling Rick Gomez's work as \\"pretty likeable.\\" GamesRadar's AJ Glasser commented that the way Zack obtains the Buster Sword and the way he gives it to Cloud is the \\"ultimate payoff\\" of Crisis Core, stating that the fact gamers know how the game will end is a serious detraction. When Ayaka finished the song \\"Why\\" for Crisis Core, she mentioned that she wanted to deliver it alongside Zack's fate \\"to the hearts of many people.\\" IGN UK's Dave McCarthy noted how Zack's role in the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII evolved as the series developed, to the point of him getting his own game. On the other hand, PSXextreme's Ben Dutka, felt that Zack was not worthy of his own game, believing that only players with \\"halfway decent memories\\" and a \\"hardcore completionist mentality\\" will be able to remember Zack's appearances in the original Final Fantasy VII. IGN UK expressed a mixed opinion about the character, feeling his personality was sometimes annoying, although it served to contrast with the serious attitudes of the other main characters. Similarly, VideoGamer.com's Wesley Yin-Poole called Zack Cloud's \\"identical twin in all but hair colour,\\" and complained about his personality being \\"annoying\\" during the first half of the game. Destructoid agreed, telling players not to expect to enjoy Zack if they do not like \\"cocky teenagers,\\" and even labelling him an \\"annoying cockhole.\\" Gameplanet criticized Rick Gomez' acting, finding it more immature than they expected. PALGN called Zack an unfamiliar character in the series since his only appearances were in backstories.

Fictional character biography =Origin= Art from Ara√±a: The Heart of the Spider #1, by Mark Brooks. On her first day at Milton Summers High School in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, Anya is caught in a skirmish between two mystical clans called The Spider Society and the Sisterhood of the Wasp, and is mortally wounded. To save her life, the mage Miguel from the Spider Society performs a ritual on her by giving her a spider-shaped tattoo that endows her with spider-like powers, and recruits her to be a Hunter for the Society. WebCorps offers her various costumes, but she decides to make her own costume. She designs a costume as \\"Ara√±a\\" with red and blue sneakers, blue track pants, red backpack, red gloves with many pockets, and large yellow- lensed goggles. As part of her powers, an insectoid exoskeleton covers most of her body with a bug-like bluish skin. In place of equipment like web-shooters or spider tracers, Anya created her own modified bolas out of discs that are about the size of her palm and have eight red legs able to grip objects. Anya fights a Hunter from The Sisterhood of the Wasp, adversaries of the Spider Society.Amazing Fantasy vol. 2 #1-6 (August 2004 - January 2005) =Heart of the Spider= While interrogating a spy for the Sisterhood of the Wasp, Anya and Miguel discover that the Sisterhood of the Wasp has recruited a fifteen- year-old boy codenamed Amun, a descendant of Egyptian assassins who believes the boy is skilled enough that he does not need to conceal his identity. Anya soon meets Amun who has enrolled at her school under the name Jon Kasiya. The two soon deduce the other's dual identity. Later, during a fight with Anya, Miguel, and the Sisterhood of the Wasp, Amun tells her that Amun will attack her loved ones if she opposes. Noting her father Gilberto \\"Gil\\" Corazon is filming the fight, Anya takes Gil to safety. In her absence, Amun seriously wounds Miguel.

Jade thinks she's bluffing, and says \\"Little miss super hero won't want my death on her conscience.\\" She replies \\"No, my conscience feels fine,\\" and lets go of the rope.

Spider-Girl decided to join him in order to make use of her knowledge of the totems.The Amazing Spider-Man vol. 3 #15 (February 2015) =Secret Wars= During the Secret Wars event when all universes were destroyed and their remains formed a single planet called Battleworld, Anya and Spider-UK found themselves in the domain called Arachnia with no memories of how they got there.Spider-Verse vol. 2 #1 (May 2015) They eventually discovered and teamed up with other Spider-powered people (consisting of Spider-Woman, Spider-Ham, Spider-Man Noir, and Spider-Man: India), neither of whom remembered their previous encounter during the original Spider-Verse.Spider-Verse vol. 2 #2 (June 2015) =Web Warriors= Following the conclusion of Secret Wars the team of six Spiders that formed during the event will rename itself and feature in a new ongoing series called Web Warriors, a name that was coined by Peter Parker from the Ultimate Spider- Man TV series during the original Spider-Verse. Powers and abilities =As Ara√±a= As Ara√±a, she originally possessed superhuman strength (able to lift three tons), speed, stamina, reflexes/reactions, agility, coordination, balance, and endurance. Anya had the ability to cling to walls, and to sprout a spider-like exoskeleton around her body which enhanced these abilities and protected her from damage. When her exoskeleton was ripped out by Doomsday Man, she retained her primary powers. Anya invented spider-like grappling hooks, which she uses to swing from buildings and as whip-like weapons, though she has found these to be harder to use since losing her abilities. =As Spider-Girl= Writer Paul Tobin stated In an interview with Newsarama that as Spider-Girl, the character initially lacks superpowers, but Tobin will be \\"staying away from having her feel crippled by any power loss; it's for sure on her mind, but Anya is a character that wants to focus on what she can do.\\" Tobin revealed that Anya regains her powers in the \\"Spider-Island\\" storyline. The Jackal copies Spider-Man's powers into the entire non-superhuman population of New York, including Anya. Anya submits to the mass cure, but retains her copy of these powers nonetheless. Other versions =Marvel Team-Up: League of Losers= Ara√±a features in an arc of Robert Kirkman's Marvel Team-Up vol. 3 featuring a group of C-list heroes dubbed \\"The League of Losers\\".

Ara√±a however, dies in an explosion while the team searches for a time machine so that they can travel to the future.Marvel Team-Up vol. 3 #16 (March 2006) The rest of the team succeeds however, and Chronok is defeated. Due to the Marvel Universe's method for resolving time travel paradoxes, this story takes place in an alternate timeline. =What If?= In the What If? Spider-Man: Grim Hunt, an alternative possibility for the events of Grim Hunt begins with the decision of Spider-Man to kill Kraven. Ara√±a, scarred by things that she should not have seen is transported by the new Madame Web to her residence. Later Madame Web appears in her room in the middle of the night asking Anya to be Spider-Girl. Anya refuses the proposal because she is worried that if she fights against Peter she will make the same decision he made. In the middle of the battle Madame Web teleports herself to get Ara√±a to confront and defeat Peter. Peter ends up blinded by a shotgun he was attempting to use on her. Ara√±a takes over as the head Spider while Peter is left permanently blinded and distant from Mary Jane.What If?

HMS GaspeeBartlett: Destruction of the Gaspee ‚Äì \\"His Britannic Majesty's Schooner Gaspee.\\" Accessed June 9, 2009. was a British customs schooner that had been enforcing the Navigation Acts in and around Newport, Rhode Island in 1772. It ran aground in shallow water while chasing the packet ship Hannah on June 9 near Gaspee Point in Warwick, Rhode Island. A group of men led by Abraham Whipple and John Brown attacked, boarded, and torched the ship. This version of the story is told by Ephraim Bowen and John Mawney in William R. Staples The Documentary History of the Destruction of the Gaspee. The only other testimony from a contemporary is that of Aaron Biggs (sometimes Briggs), an escaped slave who told a slightly different version of the story. His telling of the events was later discredited, however, when it was found that it had been given under duress. (Bartlett, John Russell. A History of the Destruction of His Britannic Majesty's Schooner Gaspee, In Narragansett Bay, On the 10th of June 1772 (Providence, RI.: A. Crawford Greene, 1861), pp. 84‚Äì87). We also have testimony from the crew and officers of the Gaspee, who reported a larger number of attackers and more boats. The event increased tensions between the American colonists and British officials, following the Boston Massacre in 1770. British officials in Rhode Island wanted to increase their control over trade‚Äîlegitimate trade as well as smuggling‚Äîin order to increase their revenue from the small colony. But Rhode Islanders increasingly protested the Stamp Act, the Townshend Acts, and other British impositions that had clashed with the colony's history of rum manufacturing, maritime trade, and slave trading. This event and others in Narragansett Bay marked the first acts of violent uprising against the British crown's authority in America, preceding the Boston Tea Party by more than a year and moving the Thirteen Colonies as a whole toward the war for independence. Background The customs service had a history of strong resistance in the Thirteen Colonies in the eighteenth century. Britain was at war during much of this period and was not in a strategic position to risk antagonizing its overseas colonies. Several successive ministries implemented new policies following Britain's victory in the Seven Years' War in an attempt to increase control within the colonies and to recoup the cost of the war from them. To that end, the Admiralty purchased six Marblehead sloops and schooners and gave them Anglicized French names based on their recent acquisitions in Canada, removing the French accents from St John, St Lawrence, Chaleur, Hope, Magdalen, and Gaspee. Parliament argued that the revenue was necessary in order to bolster military and naval defensive positions along the borders of their far-flung empire‚Äîbut also to pay the debt which England had incurred in pursuing the war against France. These changes included deputizing the Royal Navy's sea officers to enforce customs laws in American ports.See Barrow, Thomas C. Trade and Empire: The British Customs Service in Colonial America, 1660‚Äì1775 (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1967) especially page 177. See also Gipson, Lawrence Henry, The British Empire Before the American Revolution, Vol. XII The Triumphant Empire: Britain Sails into the Storm, 1770‚Äì1776. (New York, Alfred A. Knopf, 1965) especially page 26 footnote 79. The enforcements became increasingly intrusive and aggressive in Narragansett Bay; Rhode Islanders finally responded by attacking in 1764, and they burned the customs ship in 1768 on Goat Island in Newport harbor.Warships of the world to 1900, Volume 799, Ships of the World Series:Warships of the World to 1900, Lincoln P. Paine (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2000) pg. 95 In early 1772, Lieutenant William Dudingston sailed HMS Gaspee into Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay to force customs collection and mandatory inspection of cargo. He arrived in Rhode Island in February and met with Governor Joseph Wanton. Soon after he began patrolling Narragansett Bay, Gaspee stopped and inspected the sloop Fortune on February 17 and seized 12 hogsheads of undeclared rum.Staples (1845), p. 7. Dudingston sent Fortune and the seized rum to Boston, believing that any seized items left in a Rhode Island port would be reclaimed by the colonists.Staples (1845), p. 6. But this overbold move of sending Fortune to Boston brought outrage within the Rhode Island colony, because Dudingston had taken upon himself the authority to determine where trial should take place concerning this seizure, completely superseding the authority of Governor Wanton by doing so. Furthermore, it was a direct violation of the Rhode Island Royal Charter of 1663 to hold a trial outside of Rhode Island on an arrest that took place within the Colony.Samuel Greene Arnold, History of the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Vol. 2, New York: D. Appleton & Company, 1859. After this, Dudingston and his crew became increasingly aggressive in their searches, boardings, and seizures, even going so far as to stop merchants who were on shore and force searches of their wares. Public resentment and outrage continued to escalate against Gaspee in particular and against the British in general. On March 21, Rhode Island Deputy Governor Darius Sessions wrote to Governor Wanton regarding Lieutenant Dudingston, and he requested that the basis of Dudingston's authority be examined. In the letter, Sessions includes the opinion of Chief Justice Stephen Hopkins, who argues that \\"no commander of any vessel has any right to use any authority in the Body of the Colony without previously applying to the Governor and showing his warrant for so doing.\\"Staples (1845), p. 3. Wanton wrote to Dudingston the next day, demanding that he \\"produce me your commission and instructions, if any you have, which was your duty to have done when you first came within the jurisdiction of this Colony.\\"Staples (1845), p. 4. Dudingston returned a rude reply to the Governor, refusing to leave his ship or to acknowledge Wanton's elected authority within Rhode Island. The incident From an old engraving On June 9, Gaspee gave chase to the packet ship Hannah, but Gaspee ran aground in shallow water on the northwestern side of the bay on what is now Gaspee Point. Her crew were unable to free her and Dudingston decided to wait for high tide, which would possibly set the vessel afloat. Before that could happen, however, a band of Providence men led by John Brown decided to act on the \\"opportunity offered of putting an end to the trouble and vexation she daily caused.\\"Staples (1845), p. 8.This version of the story is told by Ephraim Bowen and John Mawney in Staples (1845), pp. 14‚Äì16. These men made these statements in 1826 relying on their memories from 67 years earlier.Arthur M Schlesinger, Sr. \\"Political Mobs and the American Revolution, 1765-1776,\\" Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, 90:4 (1955), 245. They rowed out to the ship and boarded her at the break of dawn on June 10. The crew put up a feeble resistance in which Lieutenant Dudingston was shot and wounded, and the Providence men burned the ship to the waterline. Joseph Bucklin was the man who shot Lt. Dudingston; other men who participated included Brown's brother Joseph of Providence, Simeon Potter of Bristol, and Robert Wickes of Warwick.Staples (1845) Most of the men involved were also members of the Sons of Liberty. Previous attacks by the colonists on British naval vessels had gone unpunished. In one case, a customs yacht was actually destroyed by fire with no administrative response.Staples (1845), p. xxxii But in 1772, the Admiralty would not ignore the destruction of one of its military vessels on station. The American Department consulted the Solicitor and Attorneys General, who investigated and advised the Privy Council on the legal and constitutional options available. The Crown turned to a centuries-old institution of investigation: the Royal Commission of Inquiry, made up of the chiefs of the supreme courts of Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey, the judge of the vice-admiralty of Boston, and Governor Joseph Wanton of Rhode Island. The Dockyard Act passed in April demanded that anyone suspected of burning British ships should be extradited and tried in England; however, the Gaspee raiders were charged with treason.Edward Thurlow and Alexander Wedderburn (the Attorney and Solicitor General) wrote to the Earl of Hillsborough on August 10, 1772 dismissing the Dockyard Act and demanding the charge of high treason instead for levying war against the King. National Archives (Public Record Office, United Kingdom) CO (Colonial Office Records) 5 159 folder 26. The task of the commission was to determine which colonists had sufficient evidence against them to warrant shipping them to England for trial. The Commission was unable to obtain sufficient evidence and declared their inability to deal with the case. Nonetheless, colonial Whigs were alarmed at the prospect of Americans being sent to England for trial, and a committee of correspondence was formed in Boston to consult on the crisis. In Virginia, the House of Burgesses was so alarmed that they also formed an inter-colonial committee of correspondence to consult with similar committees throughout the Thirteen Colonies. The Rev. John Allen preached a sermon at the Second Baptist Church in Boston which utilized the Gaspee affair to warn listeners about greedy monarchs, corrupt judges, and conspiracies in the London government. This sermon was printed seven different times in four colonial cities, becoming one of the most popular pamphlets of Colonial America.G. Jack Gravelee and James R. Irvine, eds. Pamphlets and the American Revolution: Rhetoric, Politics, Literature, and the Popular Press (Delmare, NY: Scholars' Facsimiles & Reprints, 1976), viii. This pamphlet and editorials by numerous colonial newspaper editors awoke colonial Whigs from a lull of inactivity in 1772, thus inaugurating a series of conflicts that culminated in the Battles of Lexington and Concord.  Aftermath and legacy  The British called for the apprehension and trial of the people responsible for shooting Dudingston and destroying the Gaspee. Rhode Island Governor Wanton and Deputy Governor Sessions echoed those British sentiments, though they lacked enthusiasm for punishing their fellow Rhode Islanders.Staples (1845), p. 16. A British midshipman from Gaspee described the attackers as \\"merchants and masters of vessels, who were at my bureau reading and examining my papers.\\"Staples (1845), p. 14. Admiral Montagu wrote to Governor Wanton on July 8, nearly a month after the burning of the schooner, and utilized the account of Aaron Briggs, an indentured servant claiming to have participated in the June 9 burning. Montagu identified five Rhode Islanders, in varying levels of detail, whom he wanted Governor Wanton to investigate and bring to justice: John Brown, Joseph Brown, Simeon Potter, Dr. Weeks, and Richmond.Staples (1845), p. 17. Governor Wanton responded to this demand by examining the claims made by Aaron Briggs. Samuel Tompkins and Samuel Thurston, the proprietors of the Prudence Island farm where Briggs worked, gave testimony challenging his account of June 9. Both men stated that Briggs had been present at work the evening of June 9 and early in the morning on June 10. Additionally, Wanton received further evidence from two other indentured servants working with Briggs, and both stated that Briggs had been present throughout the night in question. Thus, Wanton believed that Briggs was no more than an imposter. Dudingston and Montagu challenged Wanton's assertions, Montagu saying that \\"it is clear to me from many corroborating circumstances, that he is no imposter.\\"Staples (1845), pp. 17‚Äì20. Pawtuxet Village commemorates the Gaspee affair each year with Gaspee Days. This festival includes arts and crafts and races, but the highlight is the Gaspee Days parade, which features burning the Gaspee in effigy and a Revolutionary War battle reenactment, among other entertainments. Gaspee Point is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. There is also a plaque in the front of a parking lot on South Main Street in Providence, Rhode Island identifying the location of the Sabin Tavern, where the burning of the Gaspee was plotted.

He wrote The Art of French Horn Playing which is considered by many to be the seminal work for horn players. Other books that he wrote include The Art of Brass Playing, The Art of Musicianship, and A Photo Study of 40 Virtuoso Horn Players' Embouchures. Nancy Jordan Fako has also written a biography about his life: Philip Farkas and His Horn - A Happy, Worthwhile Life. Later in his life he helped design the Holton Farkas horn. Life On March 5, 1914, Farkas was born to Anna Cassidy Farkas and Emil Nelson Farkas. (March 5th is known by many as the Horn Duumvirate Date, as it was the birth date of both Farkas and Barry Tuckwell, two great horn players of the 20th century.) While his parents were ignorant about music, his mother encouraged him to take piano lessons; this was Farkas‚Äô first introduction to music. Around the age of twelve his Boy Scout troop needed a bugler, so Farkas volunteered for the job. He sought tutoring from a neighbor who played the trumpet, and soon became very good. Around the age of fourteen he started to develop asthma. His parents thought it would be best if he played a wind instrument in band, but the school only had a bass drum and a tuba available at the moment, so Farkas chose the tuba. Farkas had to take a street car to school, and because of the tuba‚Äôs size, the conductor began to complain that it took up too much room. Farkas asked him what instrument would be more convenient and the conductor pointed to a horn case belonging to a band that was on the street. Soon after, Farkas and his father went to downtown Chicago and rented a Schmidt horn for three dollars a month. After playing his horn for a while he fell in love with it and decided to pursue a profession as a horn player. While still in high school, he became the youngest member of the All-Chicago High School Orchestra, first horn player in the Chicago Civic Orchestra, and first horn in the Kansas City Philharmonic; this was his first professional job as a horn player. He played first chair in the Chicago Symphony, Boston, and Cleveland orchestras as well, being the only horn ever offered the solo horn positions in these three major orchestras and the youngest principal player in the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Farkas was also a music Professor; he taught at Indiana University, Northwestern University, Cleveland Institute, Kansas City Conservatory, De Paul University, and Roosevelt University. His notable pupils included Douglas Hill and Paul Marcotte. Farkas also held many clinics and performed as a soloist nationwide. Farkas founded a publishing company; Wind Music Inc‚Ä¶ He also partnered with Chicago trumpeter Renold Schilke in the founding of Schilke Music Products and as consultants to the musical instrument division of Yamaha. He received a doctorate in music, presented by Eastern Michigan University in April 1978. He is very well known for designing the top-selling Holton-Farkas horn made by the Frank Holton Company as well as a large selection of mouthpieces. He published four best-selling books to help French horn players, brass players, and all musicians improve in the art. His first book, The Art of French Horn Playing, is nicknamed the bible of horn players. Farkas was known to have a kind, cheery personality, and was very much a perfectionist. He made a big impact in the world of music, as well as to many lives along the way. He continued to practice his horn every day until his death on December 21, 1992 at the age of 78. :‚ÄúIt is my desire to create such a book, containing not only the findings of my own years of experience, but that of my teachers, which prompts me to write so complex a subject as horn playing.

He served as mayor of the city of Houston, Texas from 1992 to 1998. At the time of his death, he was Houston's oldest living mayor. Background Born to working class parents in the refinery town of Baytown, Texas in 1925, Lanier was a child of the Great Depression who was greatly influenced by Franklin Delano Roosevelt‚Äôs policies. Lanier worked while attending college and started his career as a summa cum laude graduate from the University of Texas Law School in 1949. Initially employed by Baker & Botts law firm, Lanier practiced for a decade before switching gears to pursue a business career. During that business career he worked in banking and eventually established himself as a major Houston real estate developer, focusing mostly on subdivisions and apartments. Political career In 1983, Governor Mark White appointed Lanier to the Texas Highway Commission, where he served as chairman until 1987. Lanier oversaw a $2.5 billion budget and directed the construction, maintenance and operation of the state's highway system. During this period, Lanier became an outspoken critic of a plan by Houston's Mayor Kathy Whitmire and METRO, Houston‚Äôs public transit authority, to build a monorail system. In April 1988, as part of a compromise with rail advocates, Whitmire appointed Lanier as chairman of Metro. As chairman, Lanier accused Metro staff of hiding studies that showed ridership of a rail system would be less than originally predicted and not as economically viable. Lanier resigned in December 1989 after learning Whitmire would not reappoint him because of his lack of commitment to building a rail system. Lanier spent months searching for a politician who could knock the 5-term Mayor Whitmire out of office but ultimately, he decided to do it himself. In the 1991 Houston Mayoral election, Lanier challenged Whitmire and won on the promise of putting more police on the streets, abandoning the METRO rail plan, and diverting transit funds into paving roads and sidewalks. Lanier was reelected in 1993 and 1995. Term limits prevented his candidacy in 1997, enacted in 1991 and reinforced in 1994 by a grass-roots citizen initiative spearheaded by the conservative political activist Clymer Wright. As mayor, he was affectionately referred to as \\"Mayor Bob.\\" As mayor, Lanier‚Äôs actions were guided by three core values: * That Houston should capitalize on its diversity * That his administration had to improve the city‚Äôs infrastructure, particularly the inner city, and bring it to the level of the more affluent suburbs. * That public safety should be improved. Achievements Lanier's core values were translated into specific programs once he had taken office. By the time he had left office in 1997, he had achieved the following: *1,244 Police officers or their equivalents added. *Crime reduced by 246,323 major felonies compared to 1991 rate. *5,226 units of single-family housing assistance with down payment and closing costs . rehabilitated or repaired. *5,986 units of multi-family housing completed or approved by city council. *5,287 units of public housing completed or approved by city council. *1,600 homeless beds completed or approved by city council (not including units provided by Harris County in FY 1993 and FY 1994. *20,536 homeless persons and individuals with AIDS assisted. * of sidewalks constructed or initiated. * of hike and bike trails under design and planned. * of water and sewer lines to serve families without city water and sewer service. * of street overlay accomplished or initiated. *41,322 streetlights installed, 2,512 streetlights authorized for installation. *25,290 streetlights upgraded to higher quality lighting. *312,648 traffic control signs installed and maintained. *935 traffic signals and controllers upgraded. *2,673,348 potholes filled with 48-hour maximum response time. * of right-of-way mowed. *11,810 abandoned dangerous building units demolished by the city and an additional 3,714 buildings voluntarily demolished by property owners. *2,532 abandoned dangerous building units were secured by the city. * of roadside ditches cleaned and regraded. *50,918 lots mowed. *464,578 cubic yards of trash removed by the city. * of rehabilitated sewer lines completed or initiated. * of new sewer lines completed or initiated. * of water mains replaced or initiated. The Bob Lanier Public Works Building in Houston is named after him. The Texas NAACP presented him its Texas Hero award and he also received the Hubert Humphrey Civil Rights Award. His work in transportation earned him the National Auto Dealers' Award. His work in finance brought a Bond Market Association Award. In 2000, he received the Leadership Houston Distinguished Service Award and the Urban Beautification Award from the American Horticultural Society. In 2002 he was inducted into the Texas Transportation Institute's Hall of Honor at Texas A&M; University. In August 2007 he was also inducted into the Houston Hall of Fame. Lanier was a founding member of Houston Community College, which he continued to support until the end of his life. Mayor Lanier also headed the corporation that oversaw construction of the city's new Hilton Americas ‚Äì Houston, the city‚Äôs first convention center hotel ‚Äì a project that started during his administration. Until his death in 2014, Lanier continued to manage his real estate properties, lectured several times a year, oversaw the Lanier Public Policy Conferences at the University of Houston and participated in various civic, academic and political activities.

Wellcome Collection Traditional Korean medicine (known in North Korea as Koryo medicine) is traditional medicine practiced in Korea. It originates from traditional Chinese medicine principles. History Korean medicine traditions originated in ancient and prehistoric times and can be traced back as far as 3000 B.C. when stone and bone needles were found in North Hamgyong Province, in present-day North Korea. In Gojoseon, where the founding myth of Korea is recorded, there is a story of a tiger and a bear who wanted to reincarnate in human form and who ate wormwood and garlic. In Jewang Ungi (Ï†úÏôïÏö¥Í∏∞), which was written around the time of Samguk Yusa, wormwood and garlic are described as 'edible medicine', showing that, even in times when incantatory medicine was the mainstream, medicinal herbs were given as curatives in Korea. Medicinal herbs at this time were used as remedial treatment such as easing the pain or tending injury, along with knowing what foods were good for health. Moreover, wormwood and garlic are not found in ancient Chinese herbology, showing that traditional Korean medicine developed unique practices and inherited them from other cultures. In the period of the Three Kingdoms, traditional Korean medicine was mainly influenced by other traditional medicines such as ancient Chinese medicine. In the Goryeo dynasty, a more intense investigation of domestic herbs took place: The result was the publication of numerous books on domestic herbs. Medical theories at this time were based on the medicine of Song dynasty, but prescriptions were based on the medicine of the Unified Silla period such as the medical text First Aid Prescriptions Using Native Ingredients or Hyangyak Gugeupbang (Ìñ•ÏïΩÍµ¨Í∏âÎ∞©), which was published in 1236. Other medical journals were published during this period like Introductory Guide to Medicine for the General Public or Jejungiphyobang (Ï†úÏ§ëÏûÖÌö®Î∞©). Medicine flourished in the period of the Joseon. For example, the first training system of nurses was instituted under King Taejong (1400-1418), while under the reign of King Sejong the Great (1418-1450) measures were adopted to promote the development of a variety of Korean medicinal ingredients.Korean Medicine: A Holistic Way to Health and Healing By Seoul Selection These efforts were systematized and published in the Hyangyak Jipseongbang (Ìñ•ÏïΩÏßëÏÑ±Î∞©, 1433), which was completed and included 703 Korean native medicines, providing an impetus to break away from dependence on Chinese medicine. The medical encyclopaedia named Classified Collection of Medical Prescriptions (ÈÜ´ÊñπÈ°ûËÅö, ÏùòÎ∞©Ïú†Ï∑®), which included many classics from traditional chinese medicine, written by Kim Ye-mong (ÈáëÁ¶ÆËíô, ÍπÄÏòàÎ™Ω) and other Korean official doctors from 1443 to 1445, was regarded as one of the greatest medical texts of the 15th century. It included more than 50,000 prescriptions and incorporated 153 different Korean and Chinese texts, including the Concise Prescriptions of Royal Doctors (Âæ°ÈÜ´ÊíÆË¶ÅÊñπ, Ïñ¥ÏùòÏ¥¨ÏöîÎ∞©) which was written by Choi Chong- jun (Â¥îÂÆóÂ≥ª, ÏµúÏ¢ÖÏ§Ä) in 1226. Classified Collection of Medical Prescriptions has very important research value, because it keeps the contents of many ancient Korean and Chinese medical books that had been lost for a long time. Dongui Bogam, National Museum of Korea After this, many books on medical specialties were published. There are three physicians from the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) who are generally credited with further development of traditional Korean medicine‚ÄîHeo Jun, Saam, and Lee Je-ma. After the Japanese invasion in 1592, Dongeui Bogam (ÎèôÏùòÎ≥¥Í∞ê) was written by Heo Jun, the first of the major physicians. This work further integrated the Korean and Chinese medicine of its time and was influential to Chinese, Japanese and Vietnamese medicine. The next major influence to traditional Korean medicine is related to Sasang typology (ÏÇ¨ÏÉÅÏùòÌïô). Lee Je-ma and his book, The Principal of Life Preservation in Oriental Medicine (Êù±ÈÜ´Â£Ω‰∏ñ‰øùÂÖÉ, ÎèôÏùòÏàòÏÑ∏Î≥¥Ïõê) systematically theorized with the influence of Korean Confucianism and his clinical experiences in Korea. Lee Je-ma said that even if patients suffer the same illness, patients need to use different herbal applications to treat the same illness due to the pathophysiologies of individuals. He stresses that the health of human body had a close relationship with the state of mind. He believed that the human mind and body were not separate and they closely reflected each other, and the aspect of mind needed to be considered when examining the causes of disease. Thus, not only food and natural environment but also emotional changes in humans can be another major reason for illness. He believed that medical diagnosis and treatment should be based on person's typology rather than on symptoms alone and each person should be given different prescriptions depending on the constitution of the individual.Archaeology of Psychotherapy in Korea: A Study of Korean Therapeutic Work ... By Haeyoung Jeong Sasang typology (ÏÇ¨ÏÉÅÏùòÌïô) focuses on the individual patients based on different reactions to disease and herbs. Treat illness by the treatment of the root cause through proper diagnosis. Key to this diagnosis is to first determine the internal organs or pathophysiology of each patient. The next recognized individual is Saam, a priest-physician who is believed to have lived during the 16th century. Although there is much unknown about Saam, including his real name and date of birth, it is recorded that he studied under the famous monk Samyang. He developed a system of acupuncture that employs the five element theory. In the late Joseon dynasty, positivism was widespread. Clinical evidence was used more commonly as the basis for studying disease and developing cures. Scholars who had turned away from politics devoted themselves to treating diseases and, in consequence, new schools of traditional medicine were established. Simple books on medicine for the common people were published. Lee Je-ma classified human beings into four main types, based on the emotion that dominated their personality and developed treatments for each type: * Tae-Yang (ÌÉúÏñë, ) or \\"greater yang\\" * So-Yang (ÏÜåÏñë, ) or \\"lesser yang\\" * Tae-Eum (ÌÉúÏùå, ) or \\"greater yeum\\" * So-Eum (ÏÜåÏùå, ) or \\"lesser yeum\\" Methods =Herbal medicine= Herbalism is the study and practice of using plant material for the purpose of food, medicine, or health. They may be flowers, plants, shrubs, trees, moss, lichen, fern, algae, seaweed or fungus. The plant may be used in its entirety or with only specific parts. In each culture or medical system there are different types of herbal practitioners: professional and lay herbalists, plant gatherers, and medicine makers. Herbal medicines may be presented in many forms including fresh, dried, whole, or chopped. Herbs may be prepared as infusions when an herb is soaked in a liquid or decocted‚Äîsimmered in water over low heat for a certain period. Some examples of infusion are chamomile or peppermint, using flowers, leaves and powdered herbs. Decocting examples may be rose hips, cinnamon bark, and licorice root consisting of fruits, seeds, barks, and roots. Fresh and dried herbs can be tinctured where herbs are kept in alcohol or contained in a vinegar extract. They can be preserved as syrups such as glycerites in vegetable glycerin or put in honey known as miels. Powdered and freeze dried herbs can be found in bulk, tablets, troches similar to a lozenge, pastes, and capsules. Non-oral herbal uses consist of creams, baths, oils, ointments, gels, distilled waters, washes, poultices, compresses, snuffs, steams, inhaled smoke and aromatics volatile oils. Many herbalists consider the patient's direct involvement to be critical. These methods are delivered differently depending on the herbal traditions of each area. Nature is not necessarily safe; special attention should be used when grading quality, deciding a dosage, realizing possible effects, and any interactions with herbal medications. An example of herbal medicine is the use of medicinal mushrooms as a food and as a tea. A notable mushroom used in traditional Korean medicine is Phellinus linteus known as Song-gen. =Acupuncture= Acupuncture is used to withdraw blood or stimulate certain points on humans and animals by inserting them on specific pressure points of the body. Traditional acupuncture involves the belief that a \\"life force\\" (qi) circulates within the body in lines called meridians. Scientific investigation has not found any histological or physiological evidence for traditional Chinese concepts such as qi, meridians, and acupuncture points, and many modern practitioners no longer support the existence of life force energy (qi) flowing through meridians, which was a major part of early belief systems. Pressure points can be stimulated through a mixture of methods ranging from the insertion and withdrawal of very small needles to the use of heat, known as moxibustion. Pressure points can also be stimulated by laser, massage, and electrical means. =Moxibustion= Moxibustion is a technique in which heat is applied to the body with a stick or a cone of burning mugwort. The tool is placed over the affected area without burning the skin. The cone or stick can also be placed over a pressure point to stimulate and strengthen the blood. Sancheong A Cochrane Review found limited evidence for the use of moxibustion in correcting breech presentation of babies, and called for more experimental trials. Moxibustion has also been studied for the treatment of pain, cancer, stroke, ulcerative colitis, constipation, and hypertension. Systematic reviews have found that these studies are of low quality and positive findings could be due to publication bias. Education =Graduate School of Korean Medicine= The South Korean government established a national school of traditional Korean medicine to establish its national treasure on a solid basis after the closing of the first modern educational facility (Dong-Je medical school) one hundred years ago by the Japanese invasion. In 2008, the School of Korean Medicine was established inside Pusan National University with the 50 undergraduate students on the Yangsan medical campus. The new affiliated Korean Medical Hospital and Research Center for Clinical Studies are under construction. Compared with common private traditional medicine undergraduate schools (6 years), this is a special graduate school (4+4). = General Hospital of Koryo Medicine = Koryo medicine is a form of traditional medicine used in North Korea and promoted by the North Korean government, providing half of the reported healthcare in the country. It is largely practised in the General Hospital of Koryo Medicine, Pyongyang. Examples of Koryo medicine sold commercially are Kumdang-2 and Royal Blood-Fresh, both of which are popular with Chinese tourists to North Korea.

Brown (born 1963) is an American dramatic soprano particularly admired for her portrayal of Verdi heroines. Early life and education Angela Brown was born in 1963 in Indianapolis, Indiana. She is African-American. Her mother, Freddie Mae Brown, was a painter, and her father, Walter Clyde Brown, was an autoworker at a Chrysler plant in Indianapolis for 41 years. Along with older brother George and younger brother Aaron, Brown was raised in a deeply spiritual Baptist household. Her grandfather was a Baptist minister in the city and Brown started singing at his church when she was 5 years old. Brown credits her musical experiences at church as instilling in her a love for singing. As a teenager, Brown started performing in soul music bands around Indianapolis and was highly active in the vocal music program at Crispus Attucks High School. Her high school choir director, Robert Fleck, taught Brown her first classical arias and entered her in several local music competitions, all of which Brown won. Brown also participated in her high school's musicals, playing Adelaide in Guys and Dolls among other roles. After high school, Brown attended a community college in Indianapolis part-time while working a day job as a dietary aide at Methodist Hospital. She also acted in several musicals at the pro-am Civic Theater where she got to work with several notable performers including Ginger Rogers. Brown also worked as a singing waitress for a time. The death of her younger brother led Brown, then 20, to re-examine her faith and join the Seventh-day Adventist Church with intent to become a singing evangelist. To that end, in the fall of 1986, at the age of 21, Brown enrolled at Oakwood College planning to major in biblical studies with a minor in music. Brown subsequently changed her major to music, however, after her voice teacher, Ginger Beazley, convinced her to pursue opera singing instead. Brown received a bachelor's degree in the Spring of 1991. From 1992 to 1997, Brown continued her studies at the Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University with noted voice teacher Virginia Zeani. Brown had worked frequently with Zeani while at Oakwood College, as Ginger Beazley took Brown and her other students up to IU to participate in Zeani's master classes. While in graduate school, Brown began competing in several notable music competitions. In 1994 Brown tried out for the National Council Auditions of New York's Metropolitan Opera. She made it as far as the regional finals but proceeded no further. She tried out two more years in a row, only to be stopped twice more at the regional level. She tried one last time in 1997. \\"I had nothing to lose,\\" she told The New York Times. Instead, she won everything - not only the regionals, but the semi-finals and then the finals. The win bought her entry into the world of professional opera. Brown has since gone on to win the 2000 Richard Tucker Career Grant, a 1998 Sullivan Foundation Grant, the 1998 G.B. Viotti Verdi Vocal Competition, and the 1998 Opera Carolina Competition. Career In 1997, Brown moved to New York City and began performing in a steady stream of small roles with larger opera companies and larger roles with smaller opera companies over the next several years. She also appeared in concerts with good regional orchestras and gave many recitals. In the 2000‚Äì2001 season, Brown performed with the San Antonio Symphony, Teatro La Fenice, as Serena in Porgy and Bess with Opera Company of Philadelphia, and gave several recitals.

In addition, Brown made an unexpected appearance with the Opera Company of Philadelphia when she filled in at the last minute in the title role of Strauss' Ariadne auf Naxos. Brown also filled in for an ailing singer for an orchestra rehearsal of Aida at the Metropolitan Opera. The company was so impressed with her work that they immediately called Brown's agent and booked her for two performances of Aida and 12 cover performances for the next season. In the 2004-2005 season, Brown made her critically acclaimed debut at the Metropolitan Opera in the title role of Verdi's Aida. Her performance was so well received that an article about her appeared on the front page of The New York Times on November 8, 2004. Originally she was not scheduled that night to sing, as she had already sung two performances in the scheduled run of Aida and covering the role for the remainder of the run, but she was called to replace the ailing lead that night. Opera News called her performance that of \\"one of America‚Äôs most promising Verdi sopranos\\".

It is found in the warmer parts of the Neotropics and includes numerous subspecies, including T. c. exoptatus from northern Colombia, northern Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago. The subspecies T. c. aurantiiventris is recognized by many authorities as a separate species: the orange-bellied trogon. It is a resident of tropical forests, where it nests in a hole in a termite nest or tree, with a typical clutch of two white eggs. Collared trogons feed on insects and fruit, and their broad bills and weak legs reflect their diet and arboreal habits. Although their flight is fast, they are reluctant to fly any distance. They typically perch upright and motionless. Trogons have distinctive male and female plumages, with soft, often colourful, feathers. This species is about long. The back, head and breast of the male are green, and a white line separates the breast from the red underparts. The undertail is white with black barring, and the wings are black, vermiculated with white. The female has a brown back, head and breast, a relatively uniform undertail (not clearly barred), and underparts that are slightly paler than in the male. The call is a plaintive caow, caow, caow.

It was founded in 1946 as an extension of the University of Illinois; it has grown into an independent college offering courses in 76 areas of study. These include college transfer, occupational degrees and certificates, re-training, skill development, customized training and areas of special interest. As of May 2012, there were 1305 full-time and 3142 part-time students enrolled at the college. History In 1946, the University of Illinois opened extension centers in several Illinois towns to help meet the educational needs of World War II veterans. In Danville, the center was housed at Danville High School under the direction of Principal R. M. Duffin. The centers were closed in the spring of 1949, and Danville School District 118 decided to continue teaching college classes using the name Danville Community College. Mary Miller, who had headed the DHS English department, led the new college. At that time the tuition rate was $5.00 per credit hour, with a $5.00 student and library fee. In 1951, the name was changed to Danville Junior College. In 1965, the college moved to buildings provided by the US government which had been part of the Veterans Administration on the southeast side of town; this provided the present-day campus. Local citizens raised money for the renovation of the buildings. The building which became the Clock Tower Center at DACC In June 1966, the College separated from District 118 under the provisions of the Public Junior College Act and became an independent two-year area college under the control of the Board of Trustees of Junior College District No. 507. The name Danville Junior College was changed to Danville Area Community College on July 1, 1979. Since the campus opened in 1965, several new buildings have been added, including the Mary Miller Center (named for the college's first president and housing the gymnasium and the Sciences division), the Ornamental Horticulture building, the Technology Center, the Child Development Center, and Lincoln Hall. In addition, several of the existing buildings, dating from the late 1890s, have been renovated, including the Clock Tower Center, Vermilion Hall, Cannon Hall and Prairie Hall. The Bremer Center was expanded in 2007, and the Mary Miller Complex was expanded in 2012. In 2002, DACC opened the Downtown Center in the heart of downtown Danville in order to facilitate the growing demand for career-preparatory classes. In 2006 the Downtown Center moved to the Job Training Partnership facility at 407 North Franklin Street. DACC has hosted the NJCAA Men's Division II Basketball Championship since 1994. This takes place in the Mary Miller Center Gymnasium.

It was introduced in 2001 as a replacement for the Suzuki Esteem/Baleno, with a tall 5-door SX model hatchback (for maximum inner room efficiency) and a 4-door sedan body. It featured two different 16-valve gasoline inline-four engines, with 1.5-litre and 1.8-litre, this one capable of JIS. Production was discontinued in 2007 around the world and replaced by the Suzuki SX4, except in China where production was continued by Changhe-Suzuki until 2018. Overview Models in North America got a larger and more powerful 2.0-liter engine with . A 5-speed manual transmission was standard with a 4-speed automatic optional. All-wheel- drive was available, but only with the automatic. American Aerios came in two trim levels: the S and GS (2002‚Äì2004), S and SX (2005), and Base and Premium (2006‚Äì2007). Key changes over the years included an upgrade to a new 2.3-liter engine in 2004, a major styling and interior refresh in 2005 (replacing the digital instruments with conventional analog ones), and the standardization of antilock brakes in 2006. Only the Aerio sedan remained for 2007, as the hatchback had been shelved to make room for the new 2007 SX4 hatchback. Likewise, the Aerio sedan [called Baleno Next-G in Indonesia] bowed out at year's end, making way for the 2008 SX4 Sport sedan [called Neo Baleno in Indonesia]. Throughout its run, the Aerio was distinct for being the most affordable car in America to offer all-wheel drive. In Europe, where the car was called Liana (an acronym for Life In A New Age), it was seen as a more affordable alternative to small family cars or to mini MPVs, introducing a new generation of Suzuki M engines, with 1.3-litre and 1.6-litre I4 engine. All wheel drive was available on the bigger engine. In 2004 the car was restyled with a look that closer resembled the Japanese version, and also received a Diesel engine, with a 16-valve version of the 1.4-litre HDi engine supplied by PSA Peugeot Citro√´n, capable of thanks to common rail direct injection and a variable geometry turbocharger. Changhe-Suzuki in China released a new 1.4-litre Liana hatchback in October 2010, called Liana a+, which has been sold alongside 1.6-litre versions. The Liana was facelifted for sedan and hatchback models in April 2013. The Liana remained in production in Pakistan in 1.3-litre and 1.6-litre variants until 2014. Top Gear The Liana was best known for its appearances as the Reasonably Priced Car in Top Gear's Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car segment. Celebrity guests would appear on the show every week to be interviewed and to set a lap time in a saloon model Suzuki Liana. The primary car, along with spare cars, were kept stock except for a roll cage and racing seats which were added as safety measures. In its three- year tenure on Top Gear, the Liana covered 1,600 laps of the circuit; its tires and brakes were changed 100 times; and it required six new clutches, two new hubs, driveshafts, wishbones, struts and gear linkages and a replacement wing mirror. The Liana was used from its first show until its replacement by a Chevrolet Lacetti in the show's spring 2006 season. Until 2015, it enjoyed a partial retirement, and was still brought back when the guest was a Formula 1 driver. Pikes Peak In 2001, Suzuki specially built spaceframe racing cars for hillclimb races with a bodyshell to resemble the Aerio dubbed the Suzuki Aerio P950 Pikes Peak Special driven by its rally team manager and former rally driver, Nobuhiro Tajima.

Chronologically, it is the second and final chapter of a story between Samurai Shodown and Samurai Shodown II, with Samurai Shodown III being the first chapter. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot showcasing a match between Rimururu and Basara Kubikiri. Among other series changes, aerial blocking was removed entirely. One can also no longer charge one's own \\"pow\\" gauge. The off-screen delivery man was omitted entirely from the game. The \\"CD combo\\" was added, wherein a player can press the C and D buttons together, triggering a strike that can be followed up by a sequence of button taps. SNK also added a \\"suicide\\" move, wherein one's character forfeits the round. The bonus to this is that the one committing suicide will start the next round with a full \\"POW\\" gauge. Certain finishes also enable a \\"fatality\\" move in the vein of Mortal Kombat. Characters Some of the older characters were restored, such as Charlotte, Tam Tam and Jubei Yagyu. The entire cast of the previous game also returns, though some have been retouched to further enhance the cartoonish look. Joining the cast are the two ninja brothers: *Kazuki Kazama - member of the Kazama ninja clan specializing in fire jutsu, he deserts to rescue his younger sister, Hazuki, from Amakusa's clutches. *Sogetsu Kazama - older brother to Kazuki and Hazuki who uses water jutsu; unlike Kazuki, he stays with the clan and is ordered to assassinate his brother for leaving. Cham Cham from Samurai Shodown II also makes a playable appearance, exclusively for the PlayStation port of the game known in Japan as Samurai Spirits: Amakusa's Descent Special. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Samurai Shodown IV on their December 1, 1996 issue as being the most-successful arcade game of the year. Reviewing the arcade version in GamePro, The Union Buster commented that Samurai Shodown IV lacks the depth of contemporaries such as Street Fighter Alpha 2 and Soul Edge, but for the same reason offers an easier pick-up-and-play experience. He was unimpressed with the two new characters but pleased with the return of those which had been dropped from the roster in Samurai Shodown III. He particularly praised the visuals, remarking that \\"The fighters have superb animation; several fighting stages are outright beautiful; and the special moves look awesome.\\" The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Neo Geo home version a unanimous score of 8 out of 10, praising the high number of characters and the size of the character sprites. In a review of the Virtual Console release, Nintendo Life also gave the game an 8 out of 10, but their praise focused more on the animations, heavy challenge, and the thrilling pacing of battles, commenting, \\"a single slash [is] capable of turning the tide against any opponent.\\"  Notes   References   External links  * * Samurai Shodown IV at GameFAQs * Samurai Shodown IV at Giant Bomb * Samurai Shodown IV at Killer List of Videogames * Samurai Shodown IV at MobyGames Category:1996 video games Category:ACA Neo Geo games Category:Arcade games Category:D4 Enterprise games Category:Fighting games Category:Multiplayer and single- player video games Category:Neo Geo games Category:Neo Geo CD games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Samurai Shodown video games Category:Sega Saturn games Category:SNK games Category:SNK Playmore games Category:Versus fighting games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Virtual Console games ","title":"Samurai Shodown IV"},{"id":"1167665","text":"Lee Gunther (May 30, 1935 - August 25, 1998) was a co-founder of Marvel Productions and a film editor (which, in animation parlance, means sound effects editor) on more than 85 animated shorts in all. Career Starting at Warner Bros. in the 1960s, and then at DePatie‚ÄìFreleng Enterprises, he also worked as a production manager in the 1970s. After DePatie‚ÄìFreleng was sold to Marvel Comics Group in 1981, Gunther became one of the founders of Marvel Productions, Ltd., where he served as executive vice president and executive producer on television series such as Spider-Man, G.I. Joe and The Transformers, as well as the feature-length animation Inhumanoids: The Movie. He also served as vice president of foreign production at Fox Kids. In late 1987, he co-founded Gunther-Wahl Productions with Michael Wahl. Their first task was taking over production of Alvin and the Chipmunks from Ruby Spears Productions in 1988, including the Go To the Movies series including the failed Beany and Cecil television revival by John Kricfalusi (Spumco), and then doing series such as COPS, Noozles (both 1988), Mummies Alive (1989), and Ronin Warriors (1990). He then served as executive producer of the animated series The Angry Beavers for Nickelodeon from 1997 to 2003 and Wild West C.O.W.-Boys of Moo Mesa for Greengrass Productions on ABC in 1992. He and Wahl also created The Adventures of T-Rex in 1992-1993, shortly after the Mattel Flutter Faeries lawsuit in which his partner Wahl and his wife were involved. Other productions by Gunther-Wahl included the animated adaptation of Karate Kid for Coca-Cola Telecommunications (now Sony Pictures Television) on NBC in 1989, and also the short-lived G.I.

Beck is most famous for being Polish foreign minister in the 1930s, when he largely set Polish foreign policy. He tried to fulfill Pi≈Çsudski's dream of making Poland the leader of a regional coalition, but he was widely disliked and distrusted by other governments. He was involved in territorial disputes with Lithuania and Czechoslovakia. With his nation caught between two large, hostile powers‚ÄîGermany and the Soviet Union‚ÄîBeck sometimes pursued accommodation with them and sometimes defied them, trying to take advantage of their mutual antagonism. As this proved unsuccessful, he formed an alliance with Great Britain and France, but despite mutual agreements, they would not provide effective assistance to Poland. In 1939, when Germany and the Soviet Union both invaded Poland, Beck and the rest of his government evacuated to Romania. Early life J√≥zef Beck, 1926 Beck was born into a Calvinist (Protestant) family whose forbears emigrated from Flanders to Poland in the 16th century, during the rule of Polish King Stephen B√°thory. When World War I started, Beck was a student at a college of Engineering.Stanislaw Mackiewicz, Colonel Beck and his policy, Eyre and Spottiswoode, 1944, p. 7. After the outbreak of World War I, Beck was a member of the clandestine Polish Military Organization (Polska Organizacja Wojskowa, or POW) founded in October 1914 by Pi≈Çsudski. Joining in 1914 Beck served until 1917 in the First Brigade of the Polish Legions and was an aide to Pi≈Çsudski. When the Brigade was interned, Beck escaped. After Poland regained independence, Beck was assigned as a commander of an artillery battery and assigned to the General Staff. Beck served as military attach√© to France between 1922 and 1923. The French disliked Beck to the point of spreading lies about him, such that he was a Soviet agent. In 1926 he helped to carry out the May 1926 military coup d'√©tat that brought Pi≈Çsudski to de facto governmental power. In 1926‚Äì1930 Beck served as chief of staff to Poland's Minister of Military Affairs, and in 1930‚Äì1932 as Vice Prime Minister and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs. Groomed by Pi≈Çsudski to implement Poland's foreign policy, in 1932 he took office as Minister of Foreign Affairs,Peter Stachura, Poland, 1918-1945, p. 116. a post he was to hold until the outbreak of World War II.Norman Davies, God's Playground Volume II, Oxford University Press, 1986, p. 430. Foreign minister Beck had a weak hand. Historian David G. Williamson argues that Poland with 35 million people had a large population but a thin industrial base. Furthermore, its army of 283,000 men was ill- equipped, short of artillery and poorly trained. It relied heavily on cavalry because it lacked enough mechanisation. Finally it faced long borders with two powerful dictatorships, Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union. Historian Richard Overy wrote that of all the new states in Europe: Visit to Soviet Union, 1934. From right: Maxim Litvinov, Avel Yenukidze, Mikhail Kalinin, J√≥zef Beck, Juliusz ≈Åukasiewicz. In his international diplomacy, Beck sought to maintain a fine balance in Poland's relations with its two powerful neighbours. In July 1932, he concluded the Soviet‚ÄìPolish Non-Aggression Pact and, in January 1934, the German‚ÄìPolish Non-Aggression Pact.I. Lukes and E. Goldstein, eds., The Munich Crisis, 1938 (Frank 2006), pp. 49‚Äì50. With Hermann G√∂ring, 1935 Beck complained that while Poland and Czechoslovakia were legally bound by treaty to respect the rights of their respective German minorities, the Polish minorities in Germany and the Soviet Union were not so protected.Tadeusz Piotrowski, Poland's Holocaust, McFarland, 1998, , p. 4. In addition, Beck resented that countries, such as Germany, used the Minorities Treaty to exert pressure and to become involved in the internal affairs of Poland.Peter Stachura, Poland, 1918-1945, , p. 97. In September 1934, Beck renounced the Minorities Treaty after the Soviet Union was admitted to the League of Nations.Count Edward Raczynski, In Allied London, Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1962, p. 2. After Pi≈Çsudski's death in May 1935, a power-sharing agreement was entered into by the various Pi≈Çsudskiite factions, led by General (later Marshal) Edward Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy, President Ignacy Mo≈õcicki, and Beck himself. The three individuals effectively dominated the Sanacja (Sanation) and collectively ruled Poland until the outbreak of World War II. Beck had a more-or-less free hand in formulating Poland's foreign policy. The stability of the ruling group was weakened because of personal conflicts, and none of the three men managed to assert his dominance in the late 1930s completely. The oligarchy from 1935 to 1939 is often described by historians as a \\"dictatorship without a dictator\\". Strategic ideas Hitler and Beck, 1937 Beck was hostile to the League of Nations and did not think it could help Poland. France wanted some arrangement with Poland but distrusted Beck and so he looked in new directions. He explored the possibility of realizing Pi≈Çsudski's concept of Miƒôdzymorze (\\"Between-seas\\"): a federation of central and eastern European countries stretching from the Baltic to the Black Seas, indeed in later variants, from the Arctic Ocean to the Mediterranean. Such a coalition between Germany in the west and the Soviet Union in the east might have been strong enough to deter both from military intervention. Beck realised that for the immediate future there was no realistic chance of building such a force and so he was prepared to settle in 1937‚Äì38 for a diplomatic bloc referred to as a \\"Third Europe,\\" led by Poland, which might become the nucleus of a Miƒôdzymorze federation. Beck's \\"Third Europe\\" diplomatic concept comprised a bloc of Poland, Italy, Yugoslavia, Hungary and Romania. His efforts failed for several reasons:Marek Kornat, \\"The Polish Idea of 'The Third Europe' (1937-1938): A Realistic Concept or an Ex-Post Vision?\\", Acta Poloniae Historica (2011) #103, pp. 101‚Äì126. *Both Italy and Hungary preferred to align themselves with Germany, rather than Poland; *The dispute between Romania and Hungary over Transylvania doomed efforts to include them in a common bloc. *The desire of both Italy and Hungary to partition Yugoslavia blocked any effort to include Rome, Budapest and Belgrade in an alliance. *None of the other four states that was meant to form the \\"Third Europe\\" with Poland was interested in accepting Polish leadership. From 1935 to 1939, Beck supported German claims against Czechoslovakia by citing purported mistreatment of Polish minorities in Czechoslovakia. In 1937, he began a diplomatic offensive in favour of Slovak independence.Thaddeus V. Gromada, \\"Slovak Nationalists and Poland during the Interwar Period, Jednota Annual Furdek (1979), Vol. 18, pp. 241‚Äì253. He supported Hitler's position in the Munich agreement in 1938. Within days, Poland invaded and seized Teschen, an industrial district of Czechoslovakia with 240,000 people, many of them ethnic Poles.Richard A. Woytak, \\"Polish Military Intervention into Czechoslovakian Teschen and Western Slovakia in September‚ÄìNovember 1938\\", East European Quarterly (1972) 6#3 pp. 376‚Äì387. Prelude to war  In 1937, Hitler continued to assure Beck that Germany had no claims on Danzig, but at the start of 1939, Hitler changed his earlier position and now laid claim to Danzig, adding that military force would not be used. Beck played a decisive role in early 1939 by staunchly refusing Hitler's demands to subordinate Poland and to turn it into a German puppet state. Hitler demanded for Poland to give away strategic territories to Germany and to join the Anti-Comintern Pact, which was directed against the Soviet Union. Beck rejected Hitler's demands for annexation of Polish Pomorze (Pomerania), which would have cut off Polish access to the sea and its main trade route, effectively making the Polish economy dependent on Germany. He also rejected demands for an extraterritorial rail and highway corridor that was to run to East Prussia and the Free City of Danzig, in exchange for vague promises regarding trade and annexation of territories inhabited by Ukrainians and Belorussians in the Soviet Union after a future war. While Hitler had been planning to annex Polish territory for several years, he finally decided to go ahead with his plans for war by early September 1939. 5 May 1939‚ÄîBeck addresses the Sejm, rejecting Hitler's demands. Beck was surprised when Britain, looking for a pretext to confront Germany, announced at the end of March 1939 that it would defend Poland from German attack. France also offered its support, but both countries knew there was very little they could do if Germany invaded Poland. In April 1939, Beck was in London to negotiate the terms of the British-Polish aid treaty.Jozef Garlinski, Poland in the Second World War, p. 6. Beck famously voiced his refusal of German demands in a speech on 5 May 1939:see Roman Ku≈∫niar (2009) Poland's Foreign Policy After 1989 p. 19 Similarly, Beck refused a request from the Soviets to allow Soviet forces to enter the country, which was made during talks in which the Polish side did not take part. A third proposal soon followed, once again elaborated by Britain, which promised support to the Polish government if the country's borders were endangered. This time around, Beck accepted it. According to Joseph E. Davies, the Polish government underestimated German military power. As a result, Hitler's diplomatic efforts shifted to the Soviet Union and secured the Nazi- Soviet alliance in August 1939, known as the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. It secured Soviet support in a war, a heavy flow of Soviet food and oil and an agreement to partition Poland and the Baltic states. By now, many observers realised that war between Germany and Poland was now imminent.Donald Cameron Watt, How War Came: The Immediate Origins of the Second World War, 1938‚Äì1939 (1989), p. 466. World War II Graves of J√≥zef Beck and Jan Jankowski, PowƒÖzki Military Cemetery, Warsaw Following the invasion of Poland by Germany on 1 September 1939, the start of World War II, Beck called on Poland's allies, France and Britain, to enter the war to support Poland. In spite of the agreement between them, France and Britain refused to help Poland directly though both declared war two days after the German invasion. After the Soviet Union attacked Poland from the east on 17 September 1939, Beck withdrew to Romania, together with the rest of the Polish government. In Romania, he was interned by the authorities at a hotel in Bra»ôov. It was there that he wrote a volume of memoirs, Ostatni raport (Final Report). Melchior Wa≈Ñkowicz, a popular Polish journalist, met Beck in the autumn of 1939 during his internment in Romania. This is how he described the meeting:Melchior Wa≈Ñkowicz, Po klƒôsce. Pr√≥szy≈Ñski i Sp√≥≈Çka, Warszawa 2009, p. 612. Beck died in Singureni, Romania, on 5 June 1944, after developing tuberculosis. Beck was survived by his son Andrzej Beck, who was active in the Polish community in the United States until his death in 2011. In May 1991, Beck's remains were repatriated to Poland and interred at Warsaw's PowƒÖzki Military Cemetery.

The film won three Mainichi Film Awards, including Best Film; it was submitted as the Japanese entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 31st Academy Awards, but was not chosen as one of the five nominees.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences In a June 1961 review in The New York Times, A.H. Weiler called the film \\"an odd and colorful evocation of Japan's past that is only occasionally striking\\"; \\"It is stylized and occasionally graphic fare in the manner of the Kabuki Theatre, which is realistically staged, but decidedly strange to Western tastes.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times rated the film a maximum 4 stars, and added it to his Great Movies list in 2013, making it the final film he added to the list before his death.

The film is based on an original short story by hide and features the tragic plot of two beings from a different plane of existence coming to earth, specifically Tokyo, and being overwhelmed by the city' sensory overload. The two communicate through swapping blood, and are persecuted and executed. Plot In the sphere of Athum there once lived two beautiful angels by the names of Seth and Holth. Seth was gentle, kind, and anxious one; Holth was strong, determined, and bold. They lived in peace in the sphere of Athum for eternity, since there is no time, nor age, nor decay in this world. The waters flow uphill and time is irrelevant. Athum takes all and creates everything, for eternity. The angels Seth and Holth lived there undisturbed forever. They made love by their eyes, tasting their tears, they spoke to each other by their blood. They slept in Athum's womb not knowing of any evil, plight or fear. No worry, no pain ever harmed them... and they could have gone on like this forever, if not one day bold Holth had started to ask questions... questions about other worlds, other beings, questions about life and death. He tried to force Athum to tell him but instead for an answer the angels Seth and Holth were banished to planet Earth, thrown into the harshness of light, noise and madness. They woke up from their eternal dream to find themselves reborn to a world full of questions; hectic and evil. Not knowing what to do, only trying to get home again, home to Athum, home to peace. Hunted down by humans who did not understand, nor ever loved, Seth and Holth were sacrificed and murdered. Seeing their plight in the human world Athum pitied them and allowed them to return home, but home was not the same anymore. They had seen too much, heard too much, felt too much in the human world. They lost their innocence and their faith, they could ignore the questions no longer. Cast *hide from X Japan as Seth *Tusk from Zi:Kill as Holth =Names= Seth or Set is an Egyptian god.

Approved by the FDA in 2002, it was subsequently removed from the market in 2007 due to FDA concerns about possible adverse cardiovascular effects. Before then, it was the only drug approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to help relieve the abdominal discomfort, bloating, and constipation associated with irritable bowel syndrome. Its use was also approved to treat chronic idiopathic constipation. Mechanism of action The drug functions as a motility stimulant, achieving its desired therapeutic effects through activation of the 5-HT4 receptors of the enteric nervous system in the gastrointestinal tract. It also stimulates gastrointestinal motility and the peristaltic reflex, and allegedly reduces abdominal pain. Additionally, tegaserod is a 5-HT2B receptor antagonist. Withdrawal from market On 30 March 2007, the United States Food and Drug Administration requested that Novartis withdraw tegaserod from shelves. The FDA alleged a relationship between prescriptions of the drug and increased risks of heart attack or stroke. An analysis of data collected on over 18,000 patients demonstrated adverse cardiovascular events in 13 of 11,614 patients treated with tegaserod (a rate of 0.11%) as compared with 1 of 7,031 patients treated with placebo (a rate of 0.01%). Novartis alleged all of the affected patients had preexisting cardiovascular disease or risk factors for such, and further alleged that no causal relationship between tegaserod use and cardiovascular events has been demonstrated. On the same day as the FDA announcement, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada announced that it was suspending marketing and sales of the drug in Canada in response to a request from Health Canada. In a large cohort study based on a US health insurance database, no increase in the risk of cardiovascular events were found under tegaserod treatment. In 2019, tegaserod was reintroduced as for use in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) in women under 65.

He coached the U.S. National Team at the 1990 World Cup, the team's first appearance at the tournament since 1950. Playing career As a player, Gansler made 25 appearances for the United States between 1963 and 1969, captaining the 1964 and 1968 Olympic qualifying teams and 1967 Pan American team. Of his 25 appearances, only 5, all in 1968, came in games considered full internationals. Gansler played for the Chicago Mustangs of the National Professional Soccer League in 1967. When the NPSL merged with the United Soccer Association to form the North American Soccer League, the Spurs likewise merged with the Chicago Mustangs, and Gansler played with the Mustangs of the NASL in 1968. Coaching career Gansler served in various coaching positions with the national teams beginning in 1975. In the late 1980s, he served as the coach of the U.S. U-20 national team while also coaching the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee men's soccer team. On January 16, 1989, the United States Soccer Federation hired him as the full-time coach for the United States men's national soccer team, replacing Lothar Osiander. Gansler's tenure during the 1990 FIFA World Cup was somewhat controversial, even though he led the United States to its first appearance in the final World Cup tournament in 40 years. He took a team made up primarily of college and amateur players, leaving professionals such as Rick Davis and Hugo Perez off the roster. At the time, the United States did not have a top division outdoor soccer league, the North American Soccer League having folded in 1985. Most domestic professionals at the time played in indoor leagues, and Gansler felt that the skills required for indoor soccer conflicted with the outdoor game. In addition, the United States had been awarded the 1994 World Cup, and Gansler may have wanted to expose the core of the 1994 team to the World Cup experience. Not unexpectedly, the U.S. lost all three games, although the team won a moral victory of sorts by losing to host Italy 1‚Äì0; the Italians prevented the embarrassment of a draw thanks to goalkeeper Walter Zenga. Gansler went on to coach the Kansas City Wizards, winning the club's first MLS Cup in 2000 and the U.S. Open Cup in 2004. He also coached the Milwaukee Rampage to the A-League title in 1997. He stepped down from his coaching position with the Wizards on July 19, 2006. Gansler spent the 2007 MLS Season in Canada as an assistant coach for Toronto FC. Personal life After leaving Toronto FC in 2007, he retired to spend more time with his wife, Nancy, four sons, and 11 grandchildren.

Early years Ruiz, a native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, began working in the coffee industry at a young age. His interest in that sector of agriculture led him to establish a small coffee processing company in Miramar, a section of San Juan. In 1896, Ruiz started elaborating coffee using rudimentary equipment. His small operation started to grow and he soon sent for his cousin-in-law, Tiburio Jim√©nez, who lived in Spain. In 1911, Jim√©nez went to work and immediately, he too fell in love with the coffee industry.Timeline In 1912, tragedy befell upon the family and Miguel Ruiz died. He left the company in the hands of his family and Jimenez. \\"Cafe Yaucono\\" Tomas Prado, from Yauco was the owner of \\"The Coffee Co.\\" and in 1914, created the coffee brand \\"Cafe Yaucono\\". Jim√©nez became interested in the brand and soon began negotiations with Prado with the intention of buying him out. In 1916, Prado sold \\"The Coffee Co.\\" and its brand \\"Yaucono\\" to the heirs of Migul Ruiz. In 1917, the Ruiz family sold the company and Jim√©nez quit the company. Soon afterwards, Jim√©nez started his own company with Juan Fern√°ndez which they named \\"Jim√©nez & Fernandez, Sucrs.\\". Jim√©nez & Fernandez, Sucrs, Inc. In 1921, the company, which was incorporated and renamed \\"Jimenez & Fernandez, Sucrs, Inc.\\", bought a lot in the Fern√°ndez Juncos Ave. and built a two-story building. The company operated in the first floor and the Jim√©nez family lived in the second floor. Jim√©nez married and had three children, among them Jos√© Enrique Jim√©nez. In 1931, Juan Fern√°ndez sold his part of the company to Jim√©nez. During this period the company was faced with limitations and hardships. The Great Depression, hurricanes and World War II almost completely bankrupted the entire coffee industry in Puerto Rico. Jim√©nez was forced to close his company on two occasions during this time. When Jim√©nez reopened the company, the demand for coffee was so great that its sales soared. In 1957, Tiburcio's son Jos√© Enrique, began to work for \\"Yaucono\\" and in 1960, he was named Manager of the Sales and Marketing departments. Jos√© Enrique started a strong advertising campaign and in 1963 introduced the \\"Cafe Yaucono\\" character \\"Mama In√©s\\", becoming one of the biggest marketing symbols in Puerto Rican history. In 1965, Jos√© Enrique was named president and CEO of the company. Postscript In 1985, \\"Caf√© Yaucono\\" received the highest award from the Puerto Rico Product Association, the \\"International Award for Quality\\".

It was originally enacted in 1872 as one of the original four California Codes, and has been substantially amended and revised since then. History The Penal Code enacted by the California State Legislature in February 1872 was derived from a penal code proposed by the New York code commission in 1865 which is frequently called the Field Penal Code after the most prominent of the code commissioners, David Dudley Field II (who did draft the commission's other proposed codes). The actual drafter of the New York penal code was commissioner William Curtis Noyes, a former prosecutor. New York belatedly enacted the Field Penal Code in 1881. Prior to the promulgation of the Model Penal Code in 1962, the Field Penal Code was by far the most broadly influential attempt at codification of criminal law, but was severely flawed in that it actually continued many muddled common law concepts (like malice aforethought) when the point of codification was to clean up the common law. About this, UC Berkeley law professor Sanford H. Kadish wrote in 1987: \\"None of the codes I have considered had a larger measure of influence. None deserved it less.\\" Before the enactment of the Penal Code, California relied on common law definitions of crimes as well as the accumulated case law that went back to the British common law of post-colonial times. Organization Like most of California‚Äôs codes, the Penal Code is divided into six parts, most of which contain titles, some of which are in turn subdivided into chapters, with individual sections comprising the smallest unit of content. Unlike sections of the United States Code, any particular provision of the Penal Code is usually referenced by its section number alone, especially when a police officer in the state refers to a particular criminal act over their radio. Most of this article deals exclusively with the substantive criminal law set out in Part 1. The first two titles of Part 1, up to Section 33, are preliminary and provide definitions of legal terms rather than definitions of, or punishments for, any specific crimes. The next group of titles, through Section 88, deal with crimes against the state itself, such as treason. Title 7, ending with Section 186, covers the state court system and crimes that can be committed therein, such as perjury. Title 8 covers the subject of violent crimes, and extends through Section 249. Title 9 (Sections 250 through 368) deals with offenses against public morals and decency. Title 10 (Sections 369 through 402) is devoted to \\"crimes against public health and safety,\\" while Title 11 (Sections 403‚Äì423) is reserved for \\"crimes against the public peace.\\" The topic of Title 12 (Sections 424‚Äì440) is crimes against public revenue, and of Title 13 (Sections 441 through 593), crimes against property. Title 14 (Sections 594‚Äì625) bears the heading \\"Malicious Mischief,\\" but in addition to vandalism (Section 594), it also includes such offenses as trespassing (in Section 602). Title 15 (Sections 625‚Äì653) deals with \\"Miscellaneous Crimes,\\" Title 16 (Sections 654-678) is labeled \\"General Provisions,\\" and the last title of Part 1, Title 17 (679 and 680) delineates the \\"Rights of Victims and Witnesses of Crime.\\" Part 2 of the Penal Code (Sections 681‚Äì1020) codifies the state's criminal procedure system. Part 3 of the Penal Code (Sections 2000‚Äì10007) codifies statutes governing the state's corrections system. Part 3 includes provisions governing the operation of the county jails and state prisons, as well as the administration of the death penalty. Part 4 of the Penal Code (Sections 11006‚Äì14315) codifies statutes governing criminal investigations, prison officer training, police officer training, crime control, crime prevention, and gun control. Part 5 of the Penal Code (Sections 15001‚Äì15003) consists of only two sections authorizing the California Peace Officers Memorial Foundation to establish and maintain a memorial to peace officers on the grounds of the state Capitol with private funds. Part 6 of the Penal Code (Sections 16000‚Äì34370) codifies statutes dealing with the management of weapons. California's drug laws are not found within the Penal Code at all, but in a separate enactment, the California Health and Safety Code. Likewise, provisions affecting motorists, motor vehicles, and traffic matters are contained in the California Vehicle Code.

One of the more controversial sections of the California Penal Code are the consecutive Sections 666 and 667; Section 666, known officially as petty theft with a priorand colloquially, felony petty theft and makes it possible for someone who committed a minor shoplifting crime to be charged with a felony if the person had been convicted of any theft-related offense at any time in the past; and if the person so charged has two previous felony convictions (listed as serious or violent felonies [\\"strikeable\\" offenses]), this can result in a 25-years-to-life sentence under the state's three strikes law, which is found in Section 667. The inclusion of felony petty theft within the three-strikes law, and for that matter, the three-strikes law itself, have sparked much debate both within and outside the state, and even beyond the United States. In 2003, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the California three-strikes law against constitutional challenges in two cases where the third strike was a nonviolent crimeEwing v.

Cobbler (SS-344) was launched 1 April 1945 by Electric Boat Co., Groton, Connecticut; sponsored by Mrs. J. B. Rutter; commissioned 8 August 1945, Commander J. B. Grady in command. Cobbler arrived at Key West 11 January 1946, for operations locally and in the Caribbean for exercises and training until 27 November 1948. She then sailed for Groton, arriving 1 December for a GUPPY II modernization being completed on 17 August 1949. She departed Groton 24 August for Norfolk, her home port from the time of her arrival, 27 August. She conducted operations in Florida and Caribbean waters and along the east coast visiting Quebec 10 September to 14 September 1953, and returning to Norfolk 19 September. On 27 March 1954 she cleared Norfolk for 3 weeks of operations under the control of the Operational Development Force, cruising with units of the Canadian navy and air force from Bermuda to Nova Scotia. Her operations in the Caribbean and off the east coast continued, until 6 January 1958, when she departed Norfolk for a tour of duty in the Mediterranean Sea, returning 18 April. She resumed operations off the east coast, cruising to Bermuda in June 1958, and to Quebec with midshipmen embarked in July 1959. From 9 September 1959 through 1960 she was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet's Antisubmarine Development Force. In 1962, Cobbler became one of only nine boats to undergo the GUPPY III conversion. She had a hull extension added forward of the control room, a plastic sail and the BQG-4 PUFFS passive ranging sonar, which included the three sharkfin sensors on her deck.

He is best known as a founder and former frontman of the rap rock band Crazy Town. Early life Bret Mazur grew up in Brooklyn, New York before his parents moved across the country to Hollywood, Los Angeles. It was here that he began to work as a DJ at age 16, and received the pseudonym \\"Epic\\" from a friend. Mazur graduated from William Howard Taft High School in Los Angeles. He then collaborated with Richard Wolf as part of the production team Wolf & Epic on albums by Bell Biv DeVoe, Ralph Tresvant, MC Lyte and MC Serch, among others. Crazy Town Crazy Town was formed by Mazur and Seth Binzer, who started collaborating in 1995 under the initial name of \\"The Brimstone Sluggers\\". By early 1999, they were calling themselves Crazy Town, and the full band consisted of Mazur, Binzer, Rust Epique, James Bradley Jr., Doug Miller, DJ AM, and Antonio Lorenzo \\"Trouble\\" Valli. Their debut album, The Gift of Game, was released in November 1999, having been recorded earlier that year. It would become a major success after their single Butterfly reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, sparking record sales in excess of 1.5 million. Their 2002 follow up album, Darkhorse, was a commercial failure in comparison, and the band broke up shortly after its release. Crazy Town announced they had reformed in 2007, and Mazur stated that Crazy Town's third album, tentatively titled Crazy Town Is Back, would be released right after his upcoming solo album, Strip to This in Spring 2008.

The surrounding hillsides are roughly wooded, and overlooked by rocky tops and areas of moorland. The Kyles are split into the East and West Kyles. The East Kyle () runs from Rothesay Bay north west up to the entrance to Loch Riddon. Here at the northern end of the East Kyle are the Burnt Islands and the island of Eilean Dubh. The West Kyle () runs from here southwest, past the village of Tighnabruaich out to the Sound of Bute.Ordnance Survey Explorer Map. Sheet 362: Cowal West & Isle of Bute. The area is a designated National Scenic Area. The Kyles are reflected in the name of Tighnabruaich-based Shinty team Kyles Athletic. Transport The narrowest strait is only some 300 m across and is spanned by the Calmac ferry from Rhubodach to Colintraive. The crossing takes only 5 minutes, and runs every half hour throughout the day, seven days a week. Since 1999 the service has been operated by , which formerly served on the route from Kyle of Lochalsh to the Isle of Skye. Due to her size relative to the short crossing the ferry normally sails with both ramps unfolded.Caledonian MacBrayne: Ferries of the Clyde, Highlands and Islands. Ships Illustrated. Special Issue No. 11. . p. 39. As the crossing is so short the issue of whether the ferry should be replaced by a bridge has been discussed a number of times, for example by Highlands and Islands Enterprise in 1995. The A8003 road runs above the West Kyle, reaching a height of 130 m just north of Tighnabruaich. On the mainland shore of the East Kyle the A886 road also takes a route above the shoreline, however the B866 road runs closer to the shore of Loch Riddon. The A and B roads meet just north of Colintraive, from where the route of the A886 continues over the ferry to run along the east shore of Bute to Rothesay. Tourism A trip through the Kyles of Bute was a common feature of a trip \\"doon the watter\\" on a Clyde steamer during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. As of 2018 the , the last sea-going paddle steamer in the world, still operates a summer season on the Clyde and continues to offer sailings through the Kyles. The Kyles are also very popular for yachting, and there are many sheltered anchorages. The Cowal Way, a waymarked footpath between Tighnabruaich and Tarbet, follows the shoreline of the West Kyle, below the A8003. The West Island Way, a waymarked footpath on the Isle of Bute, follows the western shore of the East Kyle for a section of its northern loop: this section is along the A886. Both routes are officially designated as being among Scotland's Great Trails. The Kyles form part of an area marketed for tourism purposes as \\"Argyll's Secret Coast\\". Conservation The area is designated as the Kyles of Bute National Scenic Area, one of the forty such areas in Scotland, which are defined so as to identify areas of exceptional scenery and to ensure its protection from inappropriate development. The designated area covers 5739 ha in total, of which 4723 ha is on land, with a further 1016 ha being marine (i.e. below low tide level), and includes land on Bute and the Cowal peninsula, extending to take in the surroundings of Loch Riddon. Bird species that can regularly be seen in the Kyles include eider ducks, oystercatchers and herons. One of the Burnt Islands, Eilean Buidhe, is the site of the remains of a circular vitrified fort about 19.5 m in diameter. The remaining walls stand up to 1.5 m on the eastern side of the site. Further north, Eilean Dearg in Loch Riddon is the site of a Medieval castle that was destroyed by naval action during Argyll's Rising in 1685.Haswell-Smith, Hamish (2004). The Scottish Islands. Edinburgh: Canongate. . p. 26 Ownership View from near the National Trust for Scotland viewpoint. The eastern shores of the East Kyle forms the Ardentraive Estate, which is owned by the Mount Stuart Trust, which also owns Mount Stuart House, and most of the Isle of Bute (including the eastern shoreline of the West Kyle). The Mount Stuart Trust is still largely controlled by the family of the Marquess of Bute, the Crichton- Stuarts. The Rhubodach estate on Bute, which includes the western shoreline of the East Kyle was formerly owner by actor and director Lord Attenborough. In August 2009 he placed estate up for sale, and a referendum carried out on 12 February 2010 showed 93% of islanders supported a plan land to buy the land for the community. In January 2011 he sold the estate, which consists mostly of forest for the reduced fee of ¬£1.48 million.

Mintz. Book Two, page 120. Silk Pagoda (2006). ) was the 22nd king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. His reign saw considerable disunity within Baekje following the fall of its capital in present-day Seoul. Background He was the first king to rule Baekje from its new capital in Ungjin, present- day Gongju, after the Han River valley was lost to Goguryeo. He ascended to the throne after his father‚Äôs death in the sack of the former Baekje capital at Hanseong. Prior to 475, Munju served as chief minister (Sang-jwa'pyeong, ‰∏ä‰ΩêÂπ≥) under his father, Gaero. In the Goguryeo assault of 475, he went to Silla to request help. According to the Samguk Sagi, he returned with 10,000 Silla warriors but was too late to prevent the fall of the capital. Reign After the move of the capital, the Baekje power structure fell into chaos when the traditional Buyeo-descended aristocracy clashed with the local Mahan-based clans; rivalry within the old aristocracy, suppressed by previous powerful kings, resurfaced. He sought to refortify Baekje‚Äôs remaining defenses and strengthen the country's position against Goguryeo. He was successful in 476 in gaining suzerainty over the kingdom of Tamna on Jeju island. In the midst of this instability, the chief general and Minister of Defense, Hae Gu, took control of the military and killed Munju's brother Buyeo Gonji in 477. After this Hae Gu exercised effective rule over the country. That year, Munju was murdered by an agent of Hae Gu.

Description A panchromatic emulsion produces a realistic reproduction of a scene as it appears to the human eye, although with no colors. Almost all modern photographic film is panchromatic. Some older types of film were orthochromatic and were not sensitive to certain wavelengths of light. As naturally prepared, silver halide photographic emulsion are much more sensitive to blue and UV light than to green and red wavelengths. The German chemist Hermann W. Vogel found out how to extend the sensitivity into the green, and later the orange, by adding sensitising dyes to the emulsion. By the addition of erythrosine the emulsion could be made orthochromatic while some cyanine derivatives confer sensitivity to the whole visible spectrum making it panchromatic. However, his technique was not extended to achieve a fully panchromatic film until the early 1900s, shortly after his death. Panchromatic stock for still photographic plates became available commercially in 1906.Ralph E. Jacobson et al., The Manual of Photography: Photographic and Digital Imaging, 9th ed., Focal Press, p. 208. . The switch from orthochromatic film, however, was only gradual. Panchromatic plates cost two to three times as much, and had to be developed in total darkness, unlike orthochromatic‚Äîwhich, being insensitive to red, could be developed under a red light in the darkroom.Geo. F. Greenfield, \\"Practical Panchromatism in the Studio\\", Wilson's Photographic Magazine, October 1912, p. 460‚Äì461. And the process that increased the film's sensitivity to yellow and red also made it oversensitive to blue and violet, requiring a yellow-red lens filter to correct it, which in turn reduced the total amount of light and increased the necessary exposure time.\\"Photography\\", The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1911, vol. 21, p. 518. Orthochromatic film proved troublesome for motion pictures, rendering pink skies as perpetually overcast, blond hair as washed-out, blue eyes nearly white, and red lips nearly black. To some degree this could be corrected by makeup, lens filters, and lighting, but never completely satisfactorily. But even those solutions were unusable for additive color motion picture systems like Kinemacolor and Prizma color, which photographed on black-and-white stock behind alternating color filters. In those cases, negative film stock after it arrived from the manufacturer had to be passed through a color-sensitizing solution, a time-consuming process that increased the film's cost from 3 cents per foot to 7 cents.Frederick A. Talbot, Moving Pictures: How They Are Made and Worked, J.B. Lippincott Co., 1912, p. 293‚Äì294. Eastman Kodak, the supplier of motion picture film, introduced a panchromatic film stock in September 1913, available on special order for photographing color motion pictures in additive systems.Richard Koszarski, An Evening's Entertainment: The Age of the Silent Feature Picture, 1915-1928, University of California Press, 1994, p. 140. . Cameramen began using it for black-and-white films too in 1918, primarily for outdoor scenes. The company introduced Kodak Panchromatic Cine Film as a regular stock in 1922.Kodak: Chronology of Motion Picture Films, 1889 to 1939. The first black-and-white feature film photographed entirely on panchromatic stock was The Headless Horseman (1922).Richard Koszarski, An Evening's Entertainment: The Age of the Silent Feature Picture, 1915-1928, University of California Press, 1994, p. 140. . Color features, by necessity, had always been photographed on panchromatic film; e.g. The World, the Flesh and the Devil (1914) and The Gulf Between (1917). But early panchromatic stock was more expensive, had a relatively short shelf-life, and was more difficult for laboratories to process. Not until the prices were equalized by competition in 1926 did it become used more widely than orthochromatic stock. Kodak discontinued manufacturing general- purpose orthochromatic motion picture film in 1930.Kodak: Chronology of Motion Picture Films, 1889 to 1939. Digital panchromatic imagery of the Earth's surface is also produced by some modern satellites, such as QuickBird, Cartosat and IKONOS. This imagery is extremely useful, as it is generally of a much higher (spatial) resolution than the multispectral imagery from the same satellite. For example, the QuickBird satellite produces panchromatic imagery having a pixel equivalent to an area , while the multispectral pixels represent an area of .

Life He was born Huub van Lieshout on November 3, 1890 in Aarle-Rixtel in the province of Brabant, the eighth of eleven children. His family was very catholic rural family. In 1903, he was enrolled in the Latin school in Gemert. After reading the biography of Fr Damien de Veuster, Huub transferred in 1905 to the minor seminary of the Picpus Fathers, becoming a member of the Congregation in 1913, at which time he received the religious name of Eustachius.\\"Eust√°quio van Lieshout (1890-1943)\\", Vatican News Service Upon completion of his theological studies in 1919, he was ordained a priest in August 1919. His first assignment was as assistant novice master for his order. He was then assigned to the towns of Maassluis and Roelofarendsveen in South Holland, where he provided pastoral care for the many Belgian refugees. In recognition of his work, the King of Belgium knighted him in the Order of Leopold. He then spent two years in Roelofarendsveen as a parochial vicar. In 1924 he was sent to Spain to learn Spanish, in anticipation of an assignment in Uruguay, however he ended up being sent to Brazil, where the language was Portuguese.\\"Blessed Eustaquio van Lieshout\\", Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary Career in Brazil Van Lieshout, along with two other Picpus priests and three lay brothers, was sent to Brazil, in response to an appeal for help by a local bishop. He arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 12 of May 1925 and had to wait until the 15th of July when he was appointed pastor for the town of Agua Suja in Romaria.Eustaquio van Lieshout Retrieved on 18 Jan 2018The inhabitants in parish of Agua Suja, where he served as a pastor, were occupied in searching gold along the shores of the river Bagagem. These people being deeply catholics didn't meet the catholic behavior in their common life. And Van saw his apostolic aim to change them. And with the course of time he managed to do this because people in his parish gradually acquired the taste to the virtuous life. Eust√°quio Retrieved on 18 Jan 2018 In 1935 he was sent by his religious superiors to Po√°. After news spread of van Lieshout's transfer, the population of the town started a bloodless uprising to stop him from leaving. Nevertheless, he left in obedience to his superiors for his new parish, where he worked to oppose the widespread practice of Candombl√©. His blessings and cures of the sick through the intersession of St. Joseph made the little village a noted center of pilgrimage. This, however, brought major problems to the town. Railroads were not able to furnish transportation for the great crowds; the lack of adequate housing meant that sanitary conditions were inadequate to the need. The police were no longer able to maintain order. Merchants sold bad food at high prices and thieves roamed the pilgrimage area preying on innocent victims. Van Lieshout was ordered to leave the parish to prevent these conditions from continuing. Despite this, tremendous crowds followed him everywhere. Brazilian authorities became so alarmed that they ordered him out of towns and villages. No one had anything against him, but they were afraid of the crowds and the commotion that would follow him. The Cardinal Archbishop of Rio de Janeiro instructed van Lieshout to leave the capital by midnight. Subsequently, a fanatical crowd blocked traffic and invaded church rectories looking for him. He left Po√° in May 1941. Somehow, he managed to find a hiding place and passed a year in peace and happiness. His final appointment was as pastor of Belo Horizonte, where he lived the last two years of his life. He was given an assistant who was able to control the crowds. No one was permitted to enter the rectory without a letter of introduction. In this fashion, Van Lieshout was able to devote his complete energy to the work of his parish. After a week of sickness caused by an insect bite, he died on August 30, 1943. He spent his last years in the precincts of Celeste Imp√©rio around Jardim Montanh√™s, where he served his masses in chapel Cristo Rei. He travelled a lot all around the area and resumed his mission in the following words \\"health and peace\\" towards the faith and charity. Eust√°quio van Lieshout Retrieved on 18 Jan 2018 At his death, on his body was found a penitential pointed iron chain, buried so deep in his flesh that it could not be removed without tearing the flesh. Miracles are attributed to him. At first he was buried at the church of Santo Domingo, Belo Horizonte. But then he was reinterred at the church of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, Belo Horizonte in 1949.Eust√°quio van Lieshout (1890-1943) Retrieved on 18 Jan 2018 =Beatification= Eust√°quio van Lieshout was venerated on April 12, 2003 by Pope John Paul II (decree of heroic virtues).Following a papal rescript of December 19, 2005, which declared authentic a miracle attributed to his intercession, van Lieshout was beatified in Belo Horizonte on June 15, 2006, the Feast of Corpus Christi that year, at a service led by the Archbishop of Belo Horizonte, Walmor de Oliveira de Azevedo.

(originally established as Walt Disney Computer Software; also known as Disney Software, Buena Vista Software, Disney Interactive, Buena Vista Interactive, and Buena Vista Games) was an American video game developer and publisher owned by The Walt Disney Company through Disney Interactive. Prior to its closure in 2016, it developed and distributed multi-platform video games and interactive entertainment worldwide. Most of the games released by Disney Interactive Studios were typically tie-in products to existing character franchises. On May 10, 2016, as a result of the discontinuation of its Disney Infinity series, Disney shut down Disney Interactive Studios, and exited the first party home console game development business in order to focus on third-party development of home console video games through other developers such as Electronic Arts (Star Wars games), WB Games (owned by rival company Warner Bros., which handles the publishing of Disney-related Lego video games and Cars 3: Driven to Win), Bandai Namco Entertainment (Disney Tsum Tsum Festival), Square Enix (Kingdom Hearts), and Capcom (several Disney games and Marvel vs. Capcom). However, it continues to release games for iOS and Android devices under its own label, Disney Mobile. History =Walt Disney Computer Software= Disney established its own in house gaming unit, Walt Disney Computer Software, Inc. (WDCS), and it was incorporated on September 15, 1988. WDCS generally used third-party development studios to design spin-off games using its existing portfolio of characters. WDCS had little success attributed by senior Disney executives due to low product quality and lack of understanding the differences between film and games. The few market successes were third-party-published games based on major Disney animated features like Aladdin and The Lion King in 1993 and 1994 respectively. This led to a move from self-developed and self-published to funding and development management of games with third parties published the game. =Disney Interactive= Using the film studio style formula, WDCS was reorganized into Disney Interactive, Inc. (DI) on December 5, 1994 with the merging of WDCS and Walt Disney Television and Telecommunications. On April 15, 1997, DI reduced its staff by 20% ending in-house video game production. source: CNet News.com, http://www.news.cnet.com . This increased the requests for licensing from third-party games companies. Under this plan, development and production cost risks were transferred to the game companies but reduced the per-unit revenue generated to Disney and effectively yielded a near 100 percent margin of licensed game sales. A thirteen-game agreement was made between Nintendo of America and Disney Interactive in 1999 for both the Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Color.Page 114. Volume 121 (June 1999) . Nintendo Power.

Buena Vista Games is probably best known for the Kingdom Hearts series along with Japanese developer Square Enix. In April 2005, BVG purchased Avalanche Software in Salt Lake City, Utah and started a Vancouver, British Columbia based game development studio, Propaganda Games. In September 2006, Buena Vista acquired Climax Racing. BVG formed a new game studio, Fall Line Studio, in November 2006 to create Disney and new game titles for the Nintendo DS and the Wii console. =Disney Interactive Studios= On February 8, 2007; The Walt Disney Company renamed Buena Vista Games to Disney Interactive Studios as part of a larger company initiative to phase out the Buena Vista brand that year. The studio publishes both Disney and non-Disney branded video games for all platforms worldwide, with titles that feature its consumer brands including Disney, ABC, ESPN, and Touchstone (which is used as a label for Disney). In July 2007, the studio acquired Junction Point Studios. On June 5, 2008, Disney Interactive Studios and the Walt Disney Internet Group, merged into a single business unit now known as the Disney Interactive Media Group,\\"Disney's games and internet divisions merging\\" , Joystiq.com, 2008. and it merged its subsidiary Fall Line Studios with its sister studio, Avalanche Software, in January 2009. In February 2009, Disney Interactive acquired GameStar, a Chinese game development company. On September 8, 2009, Disney Interactive announced that it had acquired Wideload Games. In November 2010 the executive Graham Hopper left the company. He announced his departure via an internal e-mail saying \\"the time has come for me to move on from the company and set my sights on new horizons.\\" DIS in October 2012 announced \\"Toy Box\\", a cross platform gaming initiative where Pixar and Disney characters will interact from a console game to multiple mobile and online applications. The first Toy Box cross platform game is Disney Infinity based on the Toy Story 3 game's Toy Box mode crossed with a toy line. After the purchase of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company in 2012, Disney Interactive assumed the role of developing Star Wars games for the casual gaming market, while Electronic Arts would develop Star Wars games for the core gaming market through an exclusive license (although LucasArts did retain the ability to license Star Wars games to other developers for the casual gaming market). At E3 2013, Disney and Square Enix released a teaser trailer for Kingdom Hearts III, after going seven years of not declaring any console Kingdom Hearts game since Kingdom Hearts II. The game would release nearly six years later in January 2019. Disney Interactive Studios has lost more than $200 million per year from 2008‚Äì2012 during a period in which it shut down Propaganda Games, Black Rock Studio and Junction Point Studios and its co-president John Pleasants stepped down in November 2013 after the launch of Disney Infinity. On March 6, 2014, 700 employees were laid off. After the cancellation of Disney Infinty, Disney Interactive Studios closed in 2016.

It comes with a variety of options and chassis variations, with the latest variant having four models: \\"Mira\\", \\"Mira AVY\\", \\"Mira Gino\\" and \\"Mira VAN\\". The Mira is the latest successor to the line of cars begun with the Daihatsu Fellow of 1966 and was originally introduced as the commercial version of the Cuore. Outside of Japan, the Mira has also been offered with larger 850 cc or 1000 cc engines. In Australia, the two-seater version was marketed as the Daihatsu Handivan and later as the Daihatsu Handi.Daihatsu Mira / Handi / Handivan Retrieved from www.microcarforum.com on 5 February 2009 The name \\"mira\\" is Latin meaning \\"goal\\" or \\"purpose.\\" __TOC__ History The Daihatsu Mira and Cuore replaced the Daihatsu Max Cuore in July 1980. This was replaced by the second generation (L70) of the Mira/Cuore which was introduced in 1985. For most generations there were two engine sizes available: one smaller version, to suit Japanese domestic regulations, of either 550 or 660 cc, and a bigger-engined version for export markets. The L200 variant (1990‚Äì94), for instance, came with a three-cylinder 660 cc engine with in Japan, while other parts of the world received a bigger-hearted variant with an 847 cc or 1000 cc engine. The L500 Mira was the first kei car from Daihatsu to offer a four- cylinder (660 cc) engine.  L55/L60 series (1980) Five-door, L55 Daihatsu Cuore (in Greece) Three door, L55 Daihatsu Mira rear In July 1980, the Daihatsu Mira and Cuore arrived to replace the Daihatsu Max Cuore. A certain amount of confusion arises from the fact that this, the L55-series, was the first generation Daihatsu Mira but is usually considered the second generation of the Cuore ‚Äì and that the Mira was originally marketed as the \\"Mira Cuore\\". The range was facelifted lightly in May 1982, when the Mira dropped the \\"Cuore\\" portion of its name. Also new was the sporty five-speed MGX (three doors only), fitted with radial tires. The autoclutch \\"Daimatic\\" transmission was replaced by a fully automatic two-speed unit at the same time. In October 1983, turbocharged and four-wheel drive versions of the Mira van were made available (not in conjunction, however). The L55 series was sold with two main engines: the two-cylinder AB10 unit of 547 cc, and the slightly larger 617 cc AD unit which was installed in the export-only L60 Cuore. They both featured twin balancing shafts, producing a smoothness and silent operations on par with a traditional four-cylinder engine. In tests, the 617 cc version of the car received plaudits for its refinement as well as its \\"lively\\" character and \\"enthusiastic\\" performance when compared to European competitors such as the Fiat Panda 30 and the Citro√´n Visa Club, both also with two-cylinder engines. The main issue was cost: the balance-shaft equipped bicylinder supposedly cost as much to build as a conventional four-cylinder engine. The car was also commended by Quattroruote for its agile city driving characteristics ‚Äì although it could hardly be considered fully fit for the autostrada. The \\"big\\" version has a top speed of . The bigger engine was introduced in the second half of 1982, as part of a push by Daihatsu to push its European exports. In some markets, the two engines were both available. In Belgium, for instance, they were sold as the Cuore 550 for the small version and as the Cuore 623/625, depending on which bodywork was fitted. The Cuore sold well in both Argentina and Chile in 1980 (4,300 cars shipped), but economic hardship there led to a cancellation of exports by 1982. In 1983 the Mira Turbo appeared. Only available in the Japanese market, and only as a commercial vehicle, it had a carburetted and turbocharged version of the little two-cylinder engine. This was enough for and a resulting top speed of . In February 1985 the first Mira Parco special edition arrived, heralding a long relationship between Daihatsu and the Parco clothing chain. It received 10-inch alloy wheels, front disc brakes, air conditioning, radial tires, and a special Parco interior, and were sold directly through eleven Parco stores nationwide. Parco also advertised the car through their own publications. Giovanni Michelotti used this generation Cuore as the basis for the \\"Michelotti PAC\\" prototype (Personal Automotive Commuter) shown at Geneva in 1985.  L70/L80 series (1985) Daihatsu Mira rear The second generation (L70) Mira/Cuore was released in August 1985. It had a longer wheelbase and a new generation of three-cylinder engines replacing the previous two-cylinder (AB) versions. Displacement of the new EB engines remained exactly the same, at 547 cc. For the L80 export versions an 847 cc three-cylinder was developed, called ED-10. In September 1986 a special version for the Swiss market appeared, with a narrower bore version displacing 796 cc (called ED-10A). Unlike the fractionally larger standard version, this one suited the four tax horsepower category in certain cantons, while other cantons had prominent tax limits at 800 cc.. For the Swiss tax codes, see pp. 96‚Äì97. Mira Walk-Through Van As for the domestic Japanese market versions, there were commercial versions (Mira) sold alongside passenger car versions (Cuore). The commercials had temporary rear seats which fold completely flat, and are easily recognized by luggage rails in the rear side windows. As for the previous generation, a version with switchable four-wheel drive was available for the \\"Van\\" version (chassis code L71V). The engines were originally carburetted, and either naturally aspirated or turbocharged (with intercooler). These offered and respectively.Automobil Revue 1987, p. 240 The turbo version was originally only available as a Mira (three-door commercial), and was introduced two months after the regular version. Transmissions were either four- or five-speed manuals, with a two- speed automatic also available for the atmospheric versions. In January 1986, a five-door \\"Van\\" (Mira) version was added. A \\"Walk-Through Van\\" version, using the regular bonnet combined with near square rear bodywork, appeared two months later. Folding doors (optional at the rear) made access possible even in the tightest streets. In August 1987, the Mira/Cuore received a minor facelift with a new grille and bonnet, as well as some other detail changes all making for a smoother appearance overall. Two months later a permanent four-wheel-drive version was made available in the turbocharged version. In February 1988 another Mira Parco special edition arrived. The Mira Parco was only available in black and with a bright, pop-colored interior, and was aimed at twentysomething buyers. This model sold out rapidly and for the summer a second Parco edition (now with a bright-blue interior) arrived, followed by the third Mira Parco in February 1989. This version received a turbocharged engine and four-wheel-drive. After having undergone another minor change in October 1988, a 50 PS turbocharged Mira Sedan TR/CR series for passenger use was also made available ‚Äì as a five-door version as well. A limited edition of 500 Mira Sedan TR-XX Limited were also sold. Japanese production of the L70 series ended when the new 660 cc L200 version was introduced in March 1990 in response to new regulations for the kei class. This also marked the end of the division of the line into Mira and Cuore, as the Cuore nameplate was retired in Japan with the introduction of the new model. =Thailand= Thai built Daihatsu Miracab Daihatsu's Thai arm carried on producing the L70 series after it was replaced in Japan. In addition to the regular version, they also developed a ute version for the pickup-hungry Thai domestic market from 1990 to 1995, called the Mira P1. This was built with a pickup bed, tail gate and redesigned taillights. The Mira pickup was extremely popular, with Daihatsu's Thai sales jumping by 50 percent as a result. Coming full circle, and mirroring the development of the SUV, Daihatsu also developed the Mira P4: a roofed four-seater wagon version of this micro-ute. Some P4s retained the pickup's fold down tailgate, adding a top-hinged glass, while some had a top- hinged one-piece tailgate. Later, there was an extended cab 2+2-seater ute (\\"Daihatsu Miracab\\") and also a hatchback with an enlarged rear end, called the \\"Mint\\". While originally using the smaller engines as per the original Japanese specifications, these were too long to be classified as true kei cars. Later cars have the 850 cc engine as used in many other export markets. Nonetheless, the 1997 Asian financial crisis marked the end for Daihatsu in Thailand as sales plummeted from 4,000 in 1995 to 160 in 1997. Production ended in February 1998 and by March 1998 Daihatsu no longer offered cars in the Thai market. =Philippines= In 2004 a Philippine company revived the Mira Pickup, built locally and sold as the Norkis Legacy. A panel van version is also available, as is a four-door double cab with a very short bed. Unlike the original L70 Mira, they have the later 659 cc EF engine which is also available to run on LPG. It is longer and heavier than the original, with the original two-seat pickup weighing in at and long.  L200 series (1990) The L200/201 was the third and thus far most popular generation of the vehicle, offered in a large number of variants. In the Japanese domestic market the \\"Cuore\\" name was dropped, as the differences between passenger and commercial versions were narrowed. The L200 (front-wheel drive) was produced with the Mira badge from the spring of 1990 until at least 1998, but the platform has lived on under other names. L201 was the chassis code used on export market cars, usually labelled \\"Cuore\\". As with most Kei cars, the 200-series came in two primary variants: The \\"V\\" Series is a windowed van style intended for light commercial use. This variant featured a fold down rear bench seat without seat belts. The \\"S\\" series, intended for private use, is largely similar but the larger, more comfortable rear seats are equipped with belts and are further to the rear of the vehicle with more leg room. While the seats still fold down, unlike the \\"V\\", the \\"S\\" does not offer a flat loading floor. These characteristics are due to Japanese tax preferences for commercial vehicles, which only allow for temporary accommodation in the rear and demand a flat loading floor. The range received a very subtle facelift of a more rounded overall appearance for 1993, it included altered front and rear lights, bumpers, and a new bonnet and front seats. This version was available to Japanese customers from August 1992 and also incorporated some changes to the lineup. Turbocharged automatics now received a four-speed transmission. Shortly thereafter the new RV-4 model appeared. This version, with its crossover pretensions, latched onto the wave of so-called \\"RVs\\" (recreational vehicles) that became popular in Japan in the early 1990s. The RV-4 received distinct cladding, somewhat raised suspension, a roofrack and bullbar, as well as a protective plate for the engine. Daihatsu Mira Walk-Through Van, facelift model The Mira could either be equipped with a three-speed automatic, or four- or five-speed manual transmission. A four-wheel drive variant known as the L210 was also available in V or S models, only with the five-speed manual. An electronically fuel-injected 12-valve (four per cylinder) turbo was the range topper, whereas the normally aspirated base versions made do with a one barrel carburetor. There was also a version with mechanical four-wheel steering (L220), so far the only Kei car to feature this option. To break the stranglehold of the Suzuki Alto Works on the All-Japan Rally Championship, the Mira X4R was developed in 1991. It had a strengthened engine with a forged crankshaft and flywheel and other detail improvements, a close-ratio gearbox and various chassis improvements. Equipment was stripped, with a minimal interior and diagonal tires since everything would be altered by competitors. The Group A X4R was sold at a rate of about ten units per month at a price about twenty percent higher than the regular X4. Noriyuki Hotta won the class championship in 1992. A taller, highly customizable two-seat step-van variant (\\"Walk-Through Van\\") with folding side doors was also produced, solely for the Japanese market.Kie√üler, p. 114 This reached the maximum height allowed for kei cars, two metres. ;Export Daihatsu Cuore three-door, Europe The L201 was sold outside Japan primarily in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. The three or five-door 201 retained the larger displacement engine of 847 cc (ED10K) and a choice of four- or five-speed manual transmissions, or a three-speed automatic option. This carburetted engine produced (ECE) at 5500 rpm. Van versions were also available in Australia, called Handivan (later shortened to Handi). The Van, sometimes with filled in rear windows, was also marketed in certain other markets (such as the Benelux countries) where the tax structure favoured it. The 200/201 had myriad market and model differences. Cuore badged L201's received a fog lamp on the left side. Later models of the Mira had fog lamps on both sides. The L201 had two license plate lamps while the L200 had only one. L200 Miras produced for Japan had no rear fog lamps, when sold in the United Kingdom (where Japan spec Miras were also available) they had a rear fog lamp mounted on the right hand side. Despite the Mira badge mostly being available in Right Hand Drive markets, left hand drive Mira-badged L201's were sold in the Dominican Republic. This generation of the Mira was chosen by Malaysia's Perodua to be rebadged as its first product. The L200 went on sale in Malaysia as the Perodua Kancil in 1994. After several facelifts, production of the Kancil finally came to an end in July 2009. The Malaysian built Kancil was marketed as the Daihatsu Ceria in Indonesia between 2001 and 2006.  L500 series (1994) Daihatsu Mira rear Production of the L500 Miras started in September 1994. The design of the car was slightly altered throughout but retained a look similar to that of the L200. The L500 Mira was badged outside Japan primarily as the L501 Cuore. The 200 series Mira ceased sales in Japan but continued in some other markets, where it received the same engine updates as did the export market L500. In the Japanese market the \\"Mira Moderno\\", a separate range of cars (non-commercials) was added in October 1995. This range received a minor facelift in May 1996, which was extended to the rest of the range in May 1997. In August 1997 the Mira Classic was added, a retro-look version. The Classic was available with naturally aspirated engines ( as a front-wheel drive, with 4WD) or a turbocharged option with . The Classic was succeeded by the equally retro-designed Mira Gino which was based on the fifth generation (L700). In January 1998, in cooperation with Sanrio, a \\"Hello Kitty\\" version of the Mira Moderno appeared. This was available in pastel colors and received various Hello Kitty details throughout the car, such as a Hello Kitty ignition key. Facelifted Mira Moderno Parco (1996‚Äì98) Daihatsu Mira Classic The L500 was Daihatsu's first kei class vehicle to feature a four-cylinder engine, with the option of the new JB series engine. When equipped with this engine, the model code became L502. The range of models available in the 200 platform more or less carried over to the 500 series. One change was that the export versions received fuel injection as standard, which brought the output of the 847 cc engine up by one, to . This engine was called the ED-20. The four-speed manual was no longer available, but a four-speed automatic joined the existing three-speed version in the domestic Japanese market. In November 1996 a twin-cam, 12-valve version of the 847 cc three-cylinder was also made available. This, the ED-DE, produced at 5,500 rpm. In Australia the L500 Mira was sold as the Daihatsu Charade Centro. The model remained in production in Pakistan, as the Daihatsu Cuore. The L500 was produced by Toyota Indus Motor Company between March 2000 and 2012, with the 847 cc carburetor engine (ED-10) which has been used in export models since 1986. The Pakistani Cuores have and were only built with the five-door hatchback bodywork. 2440 cars were built in 2001, although annual capacity was about four times higher.  L700 series (1998) The fifth generation Cuore received the chassis code L700, with L710 being used for four-wheel-drive versions. The new model appeared in the fall of 1998. While the engines of cars sold in the domestic Japanese market had to stay beneath the 659 cc threshold, export versions (L701/711) received a new engine: the 659 cc JB-EL was a 12-valve DOHC three-cylinder, producing at 5200 rpm. Also new for export models was the availability of a three-speed automatic. After a facelift in 2001, the car was equipped with new more powerful engine code EJ-VE engine with and VVT-i. For some markets the previous 659 cc JB-DE engine was retained. =Overseas production= Production of the L700 Mira was picked up in Malaysia in 2001, where it was sold alongside the Kancil as the Chrysler PT cruiser with the familiar Daihatsu J-series engines of 659 & 1,000 cc. Perodua ended production of the model in 2007. =Mira Gino= A retro version of the Daihatsu Mira based on the L700 platform began production in 1999, replacing the preceding Mira Classic. The Mira Gino received features and options similar to those of the regular variant but was styled with a retro look. The Mira Gino was originally only offered with a 659 cc engine in Japan, but the 1-litre JB-VE engine (as for the export market L700s) was briefly available in Japan as the Mira Gino 1000. A car based on the second generation Gino (which received its own modelcode of L650/L660) with a one-litre engine was sold in the export markets.  L250 series (2002) 2004 Daihatsu Charade SL (UK) Daihatsu Mira Avy The L250/260 Mira, unrelated to the earlier 200-series, is the sixth generation of the car. The car is produced as the Mira in Japan. The L250 was labeled Daihatsu Charade in the United Kingdom and South Africa. Elsewhere this was badged and sold as the Cuore. Export versions, equipped with the 1-liter EJ engine as first seen in the previous generation, are L251, while L260 is used on four-wheel-drive versions (for the Japanese domestic market only). After the sixth Mira was replaced in late 2006, the production line was shifted to Malaysia, where production of this car as the Perodua Viva commenced in May 2007. In Japan there is also a sportier Mira Avy version available. The range underwent a very minor facelift in August 2005. A special needs friendly (Mira Friend-Matic) version appeared in November 2006. This car could be driven directly from a special self-powered wheelchair (the \\"Mira Self-Matic\\"), with a drivers door that could open at 90 degrees and a fully automated entry and exit system. Buyers of the Self-Matic would receive government assistance. The Friend-Matic version continued to be produced until August 2009.  L275 series (2006) In December 2006, the L275, the seventh generation Mira, was presented. Initially only available as a passenger version, the Van derivative appeared in early 2007. As usual four-wheel-drive versions received a different model code (L285). Two 'Topaz Neo' KF engines are available: a 658 cc KF-VE twin-cam DVVT three-cylinder engine of , and the KF-DET turbo engine of same displacement that produces . The naturally aspirated engine is available with five-speed manual transmission, three- or four-speed automative transmission or continuously variable transmission. Export models (L276) first appeared in September 2007 and receive the very light Toyota KR engine, an inline-three of one liter's displacement. Under Japanese 10‚Äì15 test cycle, fuel economy varies from for three-speed automatic transmission to for continuously variable transmission. For cars with \\"Smart Drive package\\", which come with a new idle stop system, fuel economy increases to . Inside, the gear shift has been moved from between the front seats to centre dash. There is an optional sliding rear seat, with a range of 255 mm, for more luggage room or extra kneeroom. Sales for export 1.0 L models in South Africa (Daihatsu Charade) ended in 2011 and followed by European version (Daihatsu Cuore) in 2013. The Mira, alongside the Mira Cocoa, was discontinued in Japan on March 30, 2018. Rear view In popular culture *The Mira TR-XX appears alongside several of its kei sports car contemporaries in Kat's Run: Zen-Nippon K Car Senshuken for the Super Famicom. *The YouTube channel show Mighty Car Mods Featured multiple L700 Cuores, namely a blue-colored, two-door 2002 Daihatsu Mira which, due to severe neglected state it was found in when bought by one of the show's hosts, was affectionately called \\"The Blue Turd\\". Despite the nickname, subsequent modifications (including an engine swap from a larger Daihatsu Sirion) have elevated the model's reputation among affordable DIY car enthusiasts who watch the show. An L200 Mira TR-XX was used in their film 'Kei To The City'. In Season 9 they imported the Mira as a \\"halfcut\\", due to Australian import regulations preventing it being brought into the country as a working car. Using an Australian-bought Mira as a base car, and as much of the Japanese halfcut Mira as possible, the duo were aiming to recreate the TR-XX in Australia. The car was finally finished and revealed on September 8, 2019. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJaFUymzbAw&t;=0s *The car was also reviewed by Jeremy Clarkson on Top Gear.

The Suzuki Cappuccino is a small 2-door, 2-seater detachable hardtop Kei car produced by Suzuki. Description The vehicle was designed to meet Kei car specifications for lower tax and insurance in Japan. Weighing , the Cappuccino is powered by a turbocharged, three-cylinder, 657 cc DOHC engine (just under the 660cc maximum displacement allowed for a Kei car). Its dimensions also conformed to Kei car regulations on length and width, being long and wide. Front-rear weight distribution is claimed to be 50/50% when both seats are occupied. Layout is front mid-engined and rear-wheel drive. The hood, roof, roll bar and lower front guard panels are aluminium. Three removable roof panels mean that the car can be used as a closed coup√©; T-top; targa; or, on retraction of the rear window and roll bar, a full convertible. Roof panels stow in the trunk (taking almost all the luggage space), and the rear window/rollcage assembly retracts into the body behind the seats. Unlike many convertibles of the time, the rear window is glass and wraparound, with demisting elements. It was originally equipped with the F6A engine: later models were fitted with a K6A engine which was lighter and had chain-driven, rather than belt-driven camshafts and more torque. Both are DOHC 12-valve, inline 3-cylinder engines that were turbocharged and intercooled. Power output was a claimed at 6500 rpm to fit under the maximum power allowed for Kei cars. The initial Cappuccino featured 4-wheel disc brakes and rear- wheel drive. Later versions in Japan had an early production iteration of speed-sensing electric power-assisted steering and aluminium double wishbone suspension. Production began in 1991 and ceased in 1998. The Cappuccino's closest competitor of the time were the Autozam AZ-1, Honda Beat and the Daihatsu Leeza Spyder. (The Autozam AZ-1, Honda Beat and Suzuki Cappuccino were together called the Sporty Kei-Car's ABC.) History =Emergence= The dream of re-creating a sporting image for Suzuki began in 1987 and within two years the \\"project car\\" was shown for the first time at the Tokyo Motor Show. Suzuki intentionally designed the Cappuccino just for the Japanese market, meeting the tax needs of the Kei-class: body length less than , body width not exceeding and engine size less than 0.66 l. There was never any intention to export the Cappuccino. Production of the Cappuccino started in October 1991 at the Kosai Plant. The car had the designation SX306, and the model identification (incorporated in the VIN) EA11R. The sales launch of the Cappuccino was November 1991 in Japan, with the advertising theme: \\"fulfilling one's dream of owning a stylish and very affordable 2 seater sportscar\\". The first two years (1991‚Äì92) saw 15,113 cars produced and 13,318 (or 88% of production) sold in Japan. =UK/EU version= In 1991 Suzuki GB opened discussions with Suzuki Motor Corporation about launching the car in the United Kingdom and meeting the needs of British National Type Approval. After 18 months of negotiation and technical co-operation between SMC and SGB, the Suzuki Cappuccino type was approved and homologated, with 23 adaptations required for the vehicle to conform to British NTA. The work was performed at the Kosai Plant and at the Suzuki Import Centre. In October 1992, the Cappuccino's first public viewing outside Japan occurred at the British International Motor Show, where it won two IBCAM Design awards: Best Sportscar Under ¬£20,000 and Best Car of the Show. In October 1993, the Cappuccino was officially launched in the UK, priced at ¬£11,995. Due to the car's initial success in Japan, and the tight import quota of Japanese products to the UK, the original allocation of 1,500 cars was cut to 1,182. Such limited quantities dictated a streamlined colour choice: red and silver in the ratio 4:1. Between 1993‚Äì95, a total of 1,110 cars were registered in the UK, with the balance sold to other Suzuki distributors across Europe: Germany, France, the Netherlands and Sweden. =Revised Cappuccino (EA21R)= In 1995 tougher emission controls were set by the European Commission, which led to the unsold cars being registered by 30 September 1995; any unregistered after that date would have had to be re-homologated. Discussions took place between SMC and Suzuki distributors in Europe to assess and \\"value\\" the necessary changes for the Cappuccino to meet these new emission levels. The corporate decision was made not to proceed with a revised European version due to the vast expense involved and lack of economy of scale due to the limited production run. The later specification (EA21R), introduced in 1995, had new, lighter engine with chain-driven camshafts, slightly increased torque, lighter wheels and an optional 3-speed automatic transmission with power steering. Both EA11R and EA21R (MT only) versions had optional \\"high specification\\" BA variants, which came with an airbag for the driver, ABS on all four wheels, a limited-slip differential and (in some cases) power-operated door mirrors. There were three limited editions of the EA11R, offering variations of colour and trim; the later two had power steering.

He was the top goalscorer of the 1989 and 1997 Danish championships, and won the 2000 MLS Cup with American team Kansas City Wizards. He scored two goals in 18 caps for the Denmark national football team, and represented his country at the 1998 World Cup and 2000 European Championship tournaments. He was also a member of the Denmark team competing at the 1992 Summer Olympics. When he stopped his professional football career in 2000, he continued with triathlon. In 2005, he ran under three hours (2:59:20) in Copenhagen Marathon and under 10 hours (9:50) in an Ironman in Austria. Biography Born in Copenhagen, Molnar played football in Copenhagen clubs B 1908, Fremad Amager and Hvidovre IF. Molnar's talent was acknowledged, as he played eight games and scored four goals for the Danish under-19 youth national team from 1986 to 1988. He made his senior debut in 1987 for Hvidovre in the Danish 2nd Division, before moving to play semi-professionally for top-flight club Boldklubben Frem in 1989. Molnar got his senior level breakthrough when he became joint top goalscorer of the 1989 Danish 1st Division championship with 14 goals, as Frem finished eighth of 14 teams. He was selected for the Danish under-21 national team in June 1989. Several clubs were interested in buying Molnar, including Danish club AGF, English club Chelsea, French club Olympique Lyonnais and Standard Li√®ge from Belgium. In January 1990, Molnar moved abroad to play professionally for Standard Li√®ge. In his first full season at Liege, Molnar scored 11 goals in 26 games, and he was called up to the Danish national team by national manager Richard M√∏ller Nielsen. Molnar made his national team debut in September 1990, and he played a total three national team games until June 1991. When Li√®ge hired new manager Arie Haan, Molnar did not feel appreciated and sought to be loaned out. He moved from Li√®ge to Swiss club Servette FC in the summer 1991. Molnar became league top goalscorer, as he scored 18 goals in 34 games for Servette in the Swiss 1991‚Äì92 Nationalliga A championship. Molnar was an integral part of the Danish under-21 national team from 1991 to 1992, forming a successful attacking partnership with Peter M√∏ller. Molnar played all Denmark's games from the qualification to the semi- finals of the 1992 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship, which qualified Denmark for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. He was named 1991 Danish under-21 Player of the Year. Molnar played all of Denmark's three games at the 1992 Olympics final tournament, but was sent off for a physical scuffle with a defender in Denmark's final game before elimination against the Australia under-23s. He ended his under-21 career after the 1992 Olympics, having scored a total eight goals in 21 caps. Having ended his loan at Servette, Molnar looked to find a new club in the summer 1992. Molnar was bought by French club AS Saint-√âtienne for FRF 6.000.000. He did not fit into Saint-√âtienne's technical short passing tactics, and did not find goalscoring success at the club. He was released from his contract in January 1994, and moved back home to Denmark. In February 1994, he agreed to play for Lyngby BK in the top-flight Danish championship, now called the Danish Superliga. With the stated ambition of moving abroad, Molnar played half a year at Lyngby, but did not get along with Lyngby manager Michael Sch√§fer. He moved to German club FSV Frankfurt in September 1994. Despite scoring 12 goals in 20 games in the 1994‚Äì95 German 2nd Bundesliga season, Molnar could not keep Frankfurt from relegation into the lower Regionalliga division. Molnar went home to Denmark, and started playing for Superliga club Herf√∏lge BK in September 1995. When Lyngby's first-choice striker David Nielsen left the club in June 1996, Molnar moved back to his old club to fill the spot. He was the leading goal scorer in the 1996‚Äì97 Danish Superliga with 26 goals in 33 games, and was recalled to the Danish national team by new national manager Bo Johansson, after a hiatus of more than five years. After three goals in five games at the start of the 1997‚Äì98 Superliga season, Molnar was sold to Spanish club Sevilla FC in the secondary Segunda Divisi√≥n league, where he joined fellow Danish international Thomas Rytter. In his first year at Sevilla, Molnar scored ten goals in 27 games, and he was included in the Danish squad for the 1998 World Cup. He took part in one match at the tournament, when he most remarkably came on as a substitute in the 58th minute of the 1‚Äì1 draw with South Africa, only to be sent off eight minutes later. His second season at Sevilla was not as successful, and Molnar was dropped from the team. When visiting American international midfielder Chris Henderson in Colorado, a former teammate of his, Molnar had been fascinated by the atmosphere in the American Major League Soccer (MLS) championship. In January 2000, he moved to MLS to play for Kansas City Wizards. While at the Wizards, he was included in the Danish squad for the 2000 European Championship in June 2000. He played a single match at the tournament, before ending his national team career. He retired from football in October 2000, after scoring the game-winning goal in the 2000 MLS Cup, as the Wizards beat Chicago Fire 1‚Äì0. On 2 October 2011, he got a comeback, playing 20 minutes for his childhood-club, B1908, in a 2nd division game.

It debuted at the 1999 Tokyo Motor Show, as the Daihatsu Copen concept. The second generation model debuted as the Kopen (Future Included) at the 2013 Tokyo Motor Show. __TOC__  First generation (L880; 2002‚Äì2012)  The Copen was originally designed with a 660 cc turbocharged engine in order to meet Japanese kei car regulations. However, since this engine did not meet environmental emissions standards in several other countries, the Copen was fitted with a more powerful 1.3 L non-turbo engine in these markets in 2007. The leading characteristic of this model was the active top, a motorized hide- away hard roof. However, between 2002 and 2007 there existed a variation with a detachable top. This version was about 30 kg. lighter than the regular model.https://www.webcg.net/articles/-/16488; accessdate=20 September 2020 The Copen was never built with left-hand-drive for the first four model years (2002-2005). The right-hand-drive Copen was officially sold in Germany and some European countries from 2003 to 2005 and with smaller 660cc engine. After a lackluster sale in Germany for the right-hand-drive Copen, Daihatsu introduced the left-hand-drive Copen with bigger 1.3 L engine for non-Japanese markets,https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%80%E3%82%A4%E3%83%8F%E3%83%84%E3%83%BB%E3%82%B3%E3%83%9A%E3%83%B3 which was announced at 2005 IAA Frankfurt, along with new trim level, ZZ. The sales increased to 802 units for model year 2006. The sales number declined greatly from 2007 until the Copen was withdrawn from German market in the summer of 2011. Daihatsu introduced 60 \\"farewell edition\\" (Abschiedsmodell) Copen in Germany. The Copen has been featured on the UK show Top Gear where James May attempted to find the best convertible car. The contestants were the Mercedes-Benz CLK, Audi A4, Citro√´n C3 Pluriel, Volkswagen New Beetle, and the Copen. May loved the Copen, but he had one small problem: it felt \\"toy-ish\\". On 13 January 2011, Daihatsu announced that it would withdraw the Copen from the European market in 2011 due to the increasing strength of the Japanese Yen and sharp decline in sales from 2006 to 2011. Daihatsu announced on 2 April 2012 that the production for the Copen would cease in August 2012 with the final \\"10th Anniversary Edition\\" model. The 500 \\"10th Anniversary Edition\\" models were luxuriously appointed with leather upholstery and commemorative 10th Anniversary plate in the door openings.

At the 2013 Tokyo Motor Show, Daihatsu unveiled two Copen concept cars called the Kopen, with the tagline \\"Future Included\\". The name \\"Kopen\\" was a combination of kei class car, and \\"open\\" for convertible roadster. The spelling was changed from \\"k\\" to \\"c\\" for \\"convertible\\". Production of the new model was announced on June 19, 2014. The Copen has been restyled to be more angular than its predecessor with a new monocoque chassis structure called a D-Frame. The structure allows owners to select the interior and exterior design of the car according to their preferences. The body panels are made of 13 separate resin components, 11 of which are interchangeable to modify design and colors. The Copen also features a new suspension system, a new 660cc turbo three-cylinder engine with DVVT , better sounding exhaust system and weight reduction. In Japan, models sold initially were Copen XPLAY, Copen Robe and a special S type for the Copen Robe. The Copen Robe was officially exported to Indonesia and sold between 2015 and 2019. = Copen Cero = In 2015, Daihatsu released the Copen Cero, which has a shape close to that of the first generation model. = Copen Coupe = At the 2019 Tokyo Auto Salon, Daihatsu unveiled the Copen Coupe, a fixed- roof coup√© version of the Copen Cero. The CFRP roof features an optional sunroof. Standard features include a Momo leather wrapped steering wheel, limited-slip differential, BBS aluminum wheels, and serialized plates on the center console. Options include a sports muffler and HKS suspension. Daihatsu produced a limited run of 200 units in April 2019 to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the second generation Copen. = Copen GR Sport = The Copen GR (Gazoo Racing) Sport went on sale on October 15, 2019. It is sold under both Daihatsu and Toyota dealership networks (as the Toyota Copen GR Sport). This variant do not carry Daihatsu or Toyota logo, a neutral oval-shaped 'C' Copen logo is used instead for the front and rear badging. The Copen GR Sport gets sporty exterior looks with BBS wheels, a Momo-branded steering wheel and a specially tuned suspension for body rigidity. = Gallery = File:DAIHATSU COPEN Robe LA400 02.jpgCopen Robe rear view File:Daihatsu COPEN XPLAY (LA400K) front.JPGDaihatsu Copen XPLAY File:Daihatsu COPEN XPLAY (LA400K) rear.jpgCopen XPLAY rear view File:Daihatsu Copen Cero.jpgDaihatsu Copen Cero File:Daihatsu Copen Cero rear.jpgCopen Cero rear view File:Daihatsu Copen Coupe Tokyo Auto Salon2019 IMG 1141.jpgDaihatsu Copen Coupe File:Daihatsu COPEN GR SPORT (3BA-LA400K-KBVZ).jpgDaihatsu Copen GR Sport File:Toyota COPEN GR SPORT (3BA-LA400A-KMVZ) front.jpgToyota Copen GR Sport File:Toyota COPEN GR SPORT (3BA-LA400A-KMVZ) rear.jpgToyota Copen GR Sport File:Daihatsu Copen Robe interior.jpgCopen Robe interior Daihatsu Copen Cero interior.jpgCopen Cero interior File:Osaka Motor Show 2013 (76) Daihatsu KOPEN FUTURE INCLUDED.JPGDaihatsu Kopen RMZ Concept File:Osaka Motor Show 2013 (75) Daihatsu KOPEN FUTURE INCLUDED.JPGDaihatsu Kopen XMZ Concept  Specifications  = 2002-2012 Japanese and International Markets = ;JB- DETi engine: * 0.66L (659 cc) 16 valves turbo DOHC 4 cylinder * Power ‚Äî @ 6000 rpm * Power ‚Äî @ 6000 rpm for UK market * Torque ‚Äî @ 3200 rpm * Torque ‚Äî for UK market * Top Speed ‚Äî UK version (MT) * Top Speed ‚Äî Japanese version (MT) * Top Speed ‚Äî UK version (AT) * Top Speed ‚Äî Japanese version (AT) * Combined fuel consumption ‚Äî 44.1 mpg  5.4L/100km * 0‚Äì62 mph time ‚Äî 11.7s (MT) = 2006‚Äì2011 International Markets, not available in Japan = ;K3-VE engine: * 1.3L DVVT engine DOHC 16 valve * Power ‚Äî @ 6000 rpm * Torque ‚Äî @ 4400 rpm * Top Speed ‚Äî (MT) * Top Speed ‚Äî (AT) * Combined fuel consumption ‚Äî * 0‚Äì100 km/h (0‚Äì62 mph) time ‚Äî 9.5s (MT) = 2014 Japanese market model = ;KF engine: * 658cc 3 cylinder 12-valve DOHC intercooled turbocharged * Compression ratio ‚Äî 9.5 * Power ‚Äî at 6400 rpm * Torque ‚Äî at 3200 rpm * Combined fuel consumption ‚Äî (MT) or (AT) ;Transmission: * Manual ‚Äî KPMZ 5-speed with ratios 3.181, 1.842, 1.250, 0.916, and 0.750.

One definition offered by pioneers in the field is that volumetric displays create 3D imagery via the emission, scattering, or relaying of illumination from well-defined regions in (x,y,z) space. A true volumetric display renders a digital representation of a real object in a physical space ( volume ), the resulting \\"image\\" displays similar characteristics to a real world object enabling an observer to view it from any direction, focus a camera on a specific detail and see perspective meaning parts of the image closer to the viewer will appear bigger than parts that are further away. Volumetric 3D displays are autostereoscopic in that they create three-dimensional imagery visible to the unaided eye. Volumetric 3D displays embody just one family of 3D displays in general. Other types of 3D displays are: stereograms / stereoscopes, view-sequential displays, electro-holographic displays, parallax \\"two view\\" displays and parallax panoramagrams (which are typically spatially multiplexed systems such as lenticular-sheet displays and parallax barrier displays), re-imaging systems, and others. Although first postulated in 1912, and a staple of science fiction, volumetric displays are still not widely used in everyday life. There are numerous potential markets for volumetric displays with uses cases including medical imaging, mining, education, advertising, simulation, video games, communication and geophysical visualisation. When compared to other 3D visualisation tools such as virtual reality, volumetric displays offer an inherently different mode of interaction, with the ability for a group of people to gather around the display and interact in a natural and sociable manner, without first having to put on 3D glasses or other head gear. 3D objects rendered within a volumetric display can have characteristics that are the same as real-world objects, including focal depth, motion parallax (the ability of the display to be viewed from any direction from multiple people at the same time, with each person having their own unique view), and vergence (the ability of the human eye to focus on an object with the head tilted).  Types  Many different attempts have been made to produce volumetric imaging devices.US Patent Office There is no officially accepted \\"taxonomy\\" of the variety of volumetric displays, an issue which is complicated by the many permutations of their characteristics. For example, illumination within a volumetric display can either reach the eye directly from the source or via an intermediate surface such as a mirror or glass; likewise, this surface, which need not be tangible, can undergo motion such as oscillation or rotation. One categorization is as follows: = Swept-volume display = Swept-surface (or \\"swept-volume\\") volumetric 3D displays rely on the human persistence of vision to fuse a series of slices of the 3D object into a single 3D image.Gately, Matthew, et al. \\"A three-dimensional swept volume display based on LED arrays.\\" Journal of Display Technology 7.9 (2011): 503-514. A variety of swept-volume displays have been created. For example, the 3D scene is computationally decomposed into a series of \\"slices\\", which can be rectangular, disc-shaped, or helically cross-sectioned, whereupon they are projected onto or from a display surface undergoing motion. The image on the 2D surface (created by projection onto the surface, LEDs embedded in the surface, or other techniques) changes as the surface moves or rotates. Due to the persistence of vision, humans perceive a continuous volume of light. The display surface can be reflective, transmissive, or a combination of both. Another type of 3D display that is a candidate member of the class of swept-volume 3D displays is the varifocal mirror architecture. One of the first references to this type of system is from 1966, in which a vibrating mirrored drumhead reflects a series of patterns from a high-frame-rate 2D image source, such as a vector display, to a corresponding set of depth surfaces. An example of a commercially available Swept-volume display is the Voxon Photonics VX1. This display has a volume area that is 18cm * 18cm * 8cm deep and can render up to 500 million voxels per second. Content for the VX1 can be created using Unity or using standard 3D file types such as OBJ, STL and DICOM for medical imaging. High Resolution DICOM medical data being displayed on a Voxon VX1 Volumetric Display = Static volume = So-called \\"static-volume\\" volumetric 3D displays create imagery without any macroscopic moving parts in the image volume.Blundell, Barry G., and Adam J. Schwarz. \\"The classification of volumetric display systems: characteristics and predictability of the image space.\\" IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics 8.1 (2002): 66-75. It is unclear whether the rest of the system must remain stationary for membership in this display class to be viable. This is probably the most \\"direct\\" form of volumetric display. In the simplest case, an addressable volume of space is created out of active elements that are transparent in the off state but are either opaque or luminous in the on state. When the elements (called voxels) are activated, they show a solid pattern within the space of the display. Several static-volume volumetric 3D displays use laser light to encourage visible radiation in a solid, liquid, or gas. For example, some researchers have relied on two-step upconversion within a rare-earth-doped material when illuminated by intersecting infrared laser beams of the appropriate frequencies. Recent advances have focused on non-tangible (free-space) implementations of the static-volume category, which might eventually allow direct interaction with the display. For instance, a fog display using multiple projectors can render a 3D image in a volume of space, resulting in a static-volume volumetric display.3D Multi-Viewpoint Fog Projection Display A technique presented in 2006 does away with the display medium altogether, using a focused pulsed infrared laser (about 100 pulses per second; each lasting a nanosecond) to create balls of glowing plasma at the focal point in normal air. The focal point is directed by two moving mirrors and a sliding lens, allowing it to draw shapes in the air. Each pulse creates a popping sound, so the device crackles as it runs. Currently it can generate dots anywhere within a cubic metre. It is thought that the device could be scaled up to any size, allowing 3D images to be generated in the sky. Later modifications such as the use of an neon/argon/xenon/helium gas mix similar to a plasma globe and a rapid gas recycling system employing a hood and vacuum pumps could allow this technology to achieve two-colour (R/W) and possibly RGB imagery by changing the pulse width and intensity of each pulse to tune the emission spectra of the luminous plasma body. In 2017, a new display known as the \\"3D Light PAD\\" was published.Patel, S. K.; Cao, J.; Lippert, A. R. \\"A Volumetric 3D Photoactivatable Dye Display\\". Nature Commun. 2017, in press. The display's medium consists of a class of photoactivatable molecules (known as spirhodamines) and digital light-processing (DLP) technology to generate structured light in three dimensions. The technique bypasses the need to use high-powered lasers and the generation of plasma, which alleviates concerns for safety and dramatically improves the accessibility of the three- dimensional displays. UV-light and green-light patterns are aimed at the dye solution, which initiates photoactivation and thus creates the \\"on\\" voxel. The device is capable of displaying a minimal voxel size of 0.68 mm3, with 200 Œºm resolution, and good stability over hundreds of on‚Äìoff cycles. Human‚Äìcomputer interfaces The unique properties of volumetric displays, which may include 360-degree viewing, agreement of converge and accommodation cues, and their inherent \\"three-dimensionality\\", enable new user interface techniques. There is recent work investigating the speed and accuracy benefits of volumetric displays, new graphical user interfaces, and medical applications enhanced by volumetric displays. Also, software platforms exist that deliver native and legacy 2D and 3D content to volumetric displays. Artistic use Hologlyphics: artistic use of volumetric displays, involving lasers and lissajous curves. An artform called Hologlyphics has been explored since 1994, combining elements of holography, music, video synthesis, visionary film, sculpture and improvisation. Whilst this type of display may render visual data in a volume, it is not an addressable display and capable of only lissajous figures, such at those generated by bouncing a laser off a galvo or speaker cone. Technical Challenges Known volumetric display technologies also have several drawbacks that are exhibited depending on trade-offs chosen by the system designer. It is often claimed that volumetric displays are incapable of reconstructing scenes with viewer-position-dependent effects, such as occlusion and opacity. This is a misconception; a display whose voxels have non-isotropic radiation profiles are indeed able to depict position-dependent effects. To-date, occlusion-capable volumetric displays require two conditions: (1) the imagery is rendered and projected as a series of \\"views,\\" rather than \\"slices,\\" and (2) the time-varying image surface is not a uniform diffuser. For example, researchers have demonstrated spinning- screen volumetric displays with reflective and/or vertically diffuse screens whose imagery exhibits occlusion and opacity. One system created HPO 3D imagery with a 360-degree field of view by oblique projection onto a vertical diffuser; another projects 24 views onto a rotating controlled-diffusion surface; and another provides 12-view images utilizing a vertically oriented louver. So far, the ability to reconstruct scenes with occlusion and other position-dependent effects have been at the expense of vertical parallax, in that the 3D scene appears distorted if viewed from locations other than those the scene was generated for. One other consideration is the very large amount of bandwidth required to feed imagery to a volumetric display. For example, a standard 24 bits per pixel, 1024√ó768 resolution, flat/2D display requires about 135 MB/s to be sent to the display hardware to sustain 60 frames per second, whereas a 24 bits per voxel, 1024√ó768√ó1024 (1024 \\"pixel layers\\" in the Z axis) volumetric display would need to send about three orders of magnitude more (135 GB/s) to the display hardware to sustain 60 volumes per second. As with regular 2D video, one could reduce the bandwidth needed by simply sending fewer volumes per second and letting the display hardware repeat frames in the interim, or by sending only enough data to affect those areas of the display that need to be updated, as is the case in modern lossy-compression video formats such as MPEG. Furthermore, a 3D volumetric display would require two to three orders of magnitude more CPU and/or GPU power beyond that necessary for 2D imagery of equivalent quality, due at least in part to the sheer amount of data that must be created and sent to the display hardware. However, if only the outer surface of the volume is visible, the number of voxels required would be of the same order as the number of pixels on a conventional display. This would only be the case if the voxels do not have \\"alpha\\" or transparency values.

Kantha is very popular with tourists visiting the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent. Weave Kantha used as bed for a baby Kantha is a form of embroidery often practised by rural women. The traditional form of Kantha embroidery was done with soft dhotis and saris, with a simple running stitch along the edges. Depending on the use of the finished product they were known as Lepkantha or Sujni Kantha. The embroidered cloth has many uses including shawls, covers for mirrors, boxes, and pillows. In some cases, the entire cloth is covered with running stitches, employing beautiful motifs of flowers, animals birds and geometrical shapes, as well as themes from everyday activities. The stitching on the cloth gives it a slightly wrinkled, wavy effect. Contemporary kantha is applied to a wider range of garments such as sarees, dupatta, shirts for men and women, bedding and other furnishing fabrics, mostly using cotton and silk.

For example, : C=\\\\begin{bmatrix} 5 & -3 & 2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 15 & -9 & 6 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 10 & -6 & 4 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\qquad C^2=\\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix} although the matrix has no zero entries. =Example 4= Additionally, any matrices of the form : \\\\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & a_1 & \\\\cdots & a_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_2 & a_2 & \\\\cdots & a_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ -a_1-a_2-\\\\ldots- a_{n-1} & -a_1-a_2-\\\\ldots-a_{n-1} & \\\\ldots & -a_1-a_2-\\\\ldots-a_{n-1} \\\\end{bmatrix} such as : \\\\begin{bmatrix} 5 & 5 & 5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 6 & 6 & 6 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -11 & -11 & -11 \\\\end{bmatrix} or :\\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 2 & 2 & 2 & 2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 4 & 4 & 4 & 4 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -7 & -7 & -7 & -7 \\\\end{bmatrix} square to zero. =Example 5= Perhaps some of the most striking examples of nilpotent matrices are n\\\\times n square matrices of the form: :\\\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 2 & 2 & \\\\cdots & 1-n \\\\\\\\\\\\ n+2 & 1 & 1 & \\\\cdots & -n \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & n+2 & 1 & \\\\cdots & -n \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 1 & n+2 & \\\\cdots & -n \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\end{bmatrix} The first few of which are: :\\\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 4 & -2 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\qquad \\\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 2 & -2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 5 & 1 & -3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 5 & -3 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\qquad \\\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 2 & 2 & -3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 6 & 1 & 1 & -4 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 6 & 1 & -4 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 1 & 6 & -4 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\qquad \\\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 2 & 2 & 2 & -4 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 7 & 1 & 1 & 1 & -5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 7 & 1 & 1 & -5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 1 & 7 & 1 & -5 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 7 & -5 \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\qquad \\\\ldots These matrices are nilpotent but there are no zero entries in any powers of them less than the index. Characterization For an n \\\\times n square matrix N with real (or complex) entries, the following are equivalent: * N is nilpotent. * The characteristic polynomial for N is \\\\det \\\\left(xI - N\\\\right) = x^n. * The minimal polynomial for N is x^k for some positive integer k \\\\leq n. * The only complex eigenvalue for N is 0. * tr(Nk) = 0 for all k > 0. The last theorem holds true for matrices over any field of characteristic 0 or sufficiently large characteristic. (cf. Newton's identities) This theorem has several consequences, including: * The index of an n \\\\times n nilpotent matrix is always less than or equal to n. For example, every 2 \\\\times 2 nilpotent matrix squares to zero. * The determinant and trace of a nilpotent matrix are always zero. Consequently, a nilpotent matrix cannot be invertible. * The only nilpotent diagonalizable matrix is the zero matrix. Classification Consider the n \\\\times n shift matrix: :S = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & \\\\ldots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & \\\\ldots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\ldots & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\ldots & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}. This matrix has 1s along the superdiagonal and 0s everywhere else. As a linear transformation, the shift matrix \\"shifts\\" the components of a vector one position to the left, with a zero appearing in the last position: :S(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n) = (x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n,0). This matrix is nilpotent with degree n, and is the canonical nilpotent matrix. Specifically, if N is any nilpotent matrix, then N is similar to a block diagonal matrix of the form : \\\\begin{bmatrix} S_1 & 0 & \\\\ldots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & S_2 & \\\\ldots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\ldots & S_r \\\\end{bmatrix} where each of the blocks S_1,S_2,\\\\ldots,S_r is a shift matrix (possibly of different sizes). This form is a special case of the Jordan canonical form for matrices. For example, any nonzero 2 √ó 2 nilpotent matrix is similar to the matrix : \\\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\end{bmatrix}. That is, if N is any nonzero 2 √ó 2 nilpotent matrix, then there exists a basis b1, b2 such that Nb1 = 0 and Nb2 = b1. This classification theorem holds for matrices over any field. (It is not necessary for the field to be algebraically closed.) Flag of subspaces A nilpotent transformation L on \\\\mathbb{R}^n naturally determines a flag of subspaces : \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} \\\\subset \\\\ker L \\\\subset \\\\ker L^2 \\\\subset \\\\ldots \\\\subset \\\\ker L^{q-1} \\\\subset \\\\ker L^q = \\\\mathbb{R}^n and a signature : 0 = n_0 < n_1 < n_2 < \\\\ldots < n_{q-1} < n_q = n,\\\\qquad n_i = \\\\dim \\\\ker L^i. The signature characterizes L up to an invertible linear transformation. Furthermore, it satisfies the inequalities : n_{j+1} - n_j \\\\leq n_j - n_{j-1}, \\\\qquad \\\\mbox{for all } j = 1,\\\\ldots,q-1. Conversely, any sequence of natural numbers satisfying these inequalities is the signature of a nilpotent transformation. Additional properties * If N is nilpotent, then I+N and I-N are invertible, where I is the n \\\\times n identity matrix. The inverses are given by ::\\\\begin{align} (I + N)^{-1} &= \\\\displaystyle\\\\sum^\\\\infty_{m=0}\\\\left(-N\\\\right)^m = I - N + N^2 - N^3 + N^4 - N^5 + N^6 - N^7 + \\\\cdots, \\\\\\\\\\\\ (I - N)^{-1} &= \\\\displaystyle\\\\sum^\\\\infty_{m=0}N^m = I + N + N^2 + N^3 + N^4 + N^5 + N^6 + N^7 + \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{align} As long as N is nilpotent, both sums converge, as only finitely many terms are nonzero. * If N is nilpotent, then ::\\\\det (I + N) = 1,\\\\\\\\!\\\\, :where I denotes the n \\\\times n identity matrix. Conversely, if A is a matrix and ::\\\\det (I + tA) = 1\\\\\\\\!\\\\, :for all values of t, then A is nilpotent. In fact, since p(t) = \\\\det (I + tA) - 1 is a polynomial of degree n, it suffices to have this hold for n+1 distinct values of t. * Every singular matrix can be written as a product of nilpotent matrices.R. Sullivan, Products of nilpotent matrices, Linear and Multilinear Algebra, Vol. 56, No. 3 * A nilpotent matrix is a special case of a convergent matrix. Generalizations A linear operator T is locally nilpotent if for every vector v, there exists a k\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N} such that :T^k(v) = 0.\\\\\\\\!\\\\, For operators on a finite-dimensional vector space, local nilpotence is equivalent to nilpotence.

The Move is Daihatsu's response to the similarly designed Suzuki Wagon R that was introduced two years earlier in 1993. The Move is built upon the chassis of the Mira but with a taller body. Daihatsu had successfully sold 500,000 units of the Move during its first three years of production. __TOC__  First generation (L600; 1995)  The first-generation Move was marketed with a three-cylinder engine in Japan and with an ED-20 engine in export markets. The Japanese domestic market models were internally designated L600, or L610 when equipped with four-wheel drive system; export models were internally designated L601. In 1997, a variant marketed as the Move Custom was introduced with larger headlamps and revised front styling, and was available in subsequent generations. Daihatsu produced more than half a million L600/L610 Move models, mostly in Japan. It was imported to Europe, including the UK; its 1999 successor was not exported to Europe. The Move is offered with an optional front-wheel drive model with a turbocharged 658 cc JB-JL four- cylinder engine producing and using the internal designatione L602. The export model's ED-20 engine produced , offering more torque than the naturally aspirated 660 cc engines due to its larger displacement.

According to the Samguk Sagi, he was the eldest son of the 22nd king Munju. Background In 475, the northern Korean kingdom of Goguryeo had forced Baekje's capital south from the present-day Seoul region to Ungjin (near present-day Gongju), and the Baekje court had lost much of its power to the aristocracy. Within the aristocracy, clans from the local Mahan confederacy, which Baekje conquered and absorbed earlier, gained strength against the traditional clans descended from the northern kingdom of Buyeo. In the midst of this instability, the chief general and Minister of Defense, Hae Gu, took control of the military and killed Munju's brother Buyeo Gonji in 477. After this Hae Gu exercised effective rule over the country. That year, he ordered the death of Munju. Reign Samgeun was only thirteen years old when he took power after his father‚Äôs death. Since he was not fit to oversee the military, the armies continued to be overseen by General Hae Gu, who maintained actual political control. In 478, Hae Gu made common cause with rebels led by Yeon Sin, based in Daedu Castle. Samgeun first sent the noble Jin Nam to capture the castle with 2,000 men, but he failed. He then sent Jin Ro, who defeated the rebels with 500 men, whereupon Yeon Sin fled to Goguryeo. With this event, the Jin clan gained great strength in Baekje. The next year, Samgeun died, succeeded by his uncle Buyeo Gonji's son, Dongseong of Baekje.

In Johnson‚Äôs first season leading the club, the RailHawks won the NASL regular season title under first-year head coach Martin Rennie, going 17W-8L-3D with a then league-record 13-game unbeaten streak. From 2012-14, the RailHawks achieved national notoriety and developed a reputation as one of the toughest second-division teams in the country to play against thanks to their performances in the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. From 2012-14, the RailHawks recorded five wins against Major League Soccer opponents, including three in as many years against the LA Galaxy. The RailHawks reached the quarterfinals of the competition in both 2012 and 2014. In 2015, Johnson helped oversee the transfer in ownership of the RailHawks from Traffic Sports USA to Stephen Malik, a local Triangle businessman and medical software entrepreneur. Bolstered by new, local ownership, Johnson in 2016 was instrumental in the RailHawks hosting English Premier League Club West Ham United in front of a then North Carolina Football Club-record 10,125 fans. In December 2016, the RailHawks rebranded to North Carolina FC, and in January 2017 Malik announced the addition of the North Carolina Courage, an NWSL team which Johnson was named president and general manager of. Both NCFC and the Courage reached the postseason in 2017, as the Courage claimed the NWSL Shield and reached the league‚Äôs title game. Johnson also played a pivotal role in negotiating an historic partnership between North Carolina Football Club, Capital Area Soccer League and Triangle Futbol Club, which led to the creation of NCFC Youth, which Johnson currently serves on the board of. As a result, North Carolina Football Club is the largest youth-to-pro soccer organization in the U.S. Ahead of the 2018 season, Johnson helped orchestrate a deals that saw the Courage acquire U.S. Women‚Äôs National Team star Crystal Dunn and former USWNT standout Heather O'Reilly, and the team became the first in NWSL history win both the shield and NWSL Championship. Following the 2018 USL season, Johnson made his second NCFC coaching change, as the club announced the hiring of former U.S. Men‚Äôs National Team Manager Dave Sarachan on Dec. 17, 2018. With Sarachan in charge, NCFC finished seventh in the USL Championship Eastern Conference and reached the playoffs for the second time in three years in 2019. Meanwhile, the Courage made history by becoming the first team in NWSL history to win a league championship on its home field, as it defeated the Chicago Red Stars 4-0 in front 10,227 spectators, the largest crowd in North Carolina Football Club history.  Previous Front Office Experience  Johnson‚Äôs first stint as a professional soccer executive came in the late 1990s with the Richmond Kickers of the A-League. From 1997-99, Johnson served in a leadership role, both as vice president of operations and general manager. During Johnson‚Äôs tenure with the Kickers, the team reached the postseason annually and won the Atlantic Division in 1998. After his third season in Richmond, Johnson was chosen as the general manager of the Kansas City Wizards by Lamar Hunt and Clark Hunt. During his tenure with the Wizards, Johnson made an immediate impact, as Kansas City completed the double by winning both the MLS Supporters‚Äô Shield and the MLS Cup in 2000. Four years later, Johnson and Kansas City once again lifted a trophy in 2004 with a win over the Chicago Fire in the U.S. Open Cup Final. In addition to his tactical and management decision making, Johnson was also instrumental in the transfer of ownership of the club from the Hunt family to OnGoal, LLC. Before joining North Carolina Football Club in 2011, Johnson served as the Carolina Hurricanes‚Äô director of marketing from 2007-08 and later worked for U.S. Club Soccer, where he was instrumental in developing strategies for growth of the game at the youth levels for both boys and girls.

It is the successor to the Combino family. The first generation was sold as the Combino Supra , Combino MkII, or Combino Plus. With the introduction of the second generation in 2009 the Combino brand was dropped and Siemens have referred to Combino Plus trams in Almada (Portugal) and Budapest (Hungary) as part of the Avenio range. The Avenio is made of stainless steel instead of light materials, and is manufactured at a new assembly line in Vienna. Like the Combino it utilizes a modular design with standardised components, with resulting reduced costs. Differences between the original Combino and the Combino Supra Unlike the Combino, the Combino Supra is designed in fixed sections. Each section has a bogie, either powered or unpowered. The length can be anywhere from two sections () to eight (). In Budapest and Almad, modules are in two-car blocks, each connected by a double articulation joint. In the Combino and other articulated low-floor trams, the modules are suspended between the bogies. Siemens claims the axle load is for a width of , such as the Almada.Siemens Combino Plus website - 'Flexibility' For Budapest, the length went from nine modules of the Combino to six for the Combino Supra.Combino Budapest Reference brochure The Combino had a half-width door near the driver's cab, where the Combino Supra has a full double-leaf door. Combino Plus =Budapest= The city transport company of Budapest ordered 40 Combino Supra Budapest NF 12B units for the city's tram network. The six- module trams (three units of two sections) are 53.99 meters long, exceeded only by the 59.4 m CarGoTrams in Dresden, thus making them the longest passenger trams in the world at the time of their introduction. (In 2016 56 meters long CAF Urbos 3 trams entered service in Budapest.) The first two units were delivered on March 14, 2006, and the rest was delivered by the summer of 2007. In the summer of 2006 problems arose. On August 1, 2006 Budapest mayor G√°bor Demszky ordered all six trams to be withdrawn from service until technical problems were cleared up.Caboodle.hu - Budapest mayor calls for withdrawal of faulty Combino trams There were problems with the doors, caused by sensitive fail-safe systems that brought trams to a halt for reasons including luggage or the odd leg getting stuck in a door.The Budapest Sun Online - Mayor touts Budapest as leading regional capital Siemens AG reportedly admitted the door problem to be a \\"design fault\\".Caboodle.hu - New Combino tram fails shortly after resuming service Another problem was the overhead wires, rebuilt in April and June for the new trams. This was done in a hurry and of poor quality, causing the Ganz trams still running to have problems with their pantographs.

These three-module units were supposed to be 28 metres in length, have a width of 2.5 metres, and carry 183 passengers. Siemens withdrew their first bid, citing an inability to meet the TTC's 25-percent Canadian content requirement. When tenders were reopened in August 2008, Siemens bid again using the same model, but their price was 50 percent higher than that of Bombardier's locally built Flexity Outlook model, who subsequently won the bid.  Avenio  The Avenio brand was introduced at the UITP 2009 trade fair in Vienna, marketed as the \\"longest tram in the world\\" with 100% low floor (referring to the 72 meter version with eight modules). Avenio is based on the Combino Plus but is simplified. There is now one secondary spring which now seemingly can do the work of two. There are more seats over the bogies. There are no more hydraulics and the tram is made of CorTen steel. So in fact it is a completely new design. = Tel Aviv = It was announced that the first production series would go to Tel Aviv in Israel for its upcoming light rail network, but the project was delayed and the construction of the first line, the Red Line, started in September 2011.

Overview and history The Seeley Historical Library, part of the Faculty of History The Sidgwick Site is located on the western side of Cambridge city centre, near the College backs. The site is north of Sidgwick Avenue and south of West Road, and is home to several of the university's arts and humanities faculties. The site is named after the philosopher Henry Sidgwick, who studied at Cambridge in the 19th century. The site as it is now has its origins in plans drawn up by Casson and Conder in 1952 for making use of land to the west of the Cambridge city centre which was previously used mainly for sports. Much of the site's current architecture derives from these original plans. However, many faculty buildings, especially to the north of the site, have been designed by separate architects with little reference to the coherence of the site as a whole. In July 2002, the old Faculty of English, a converted Victorian villa, was demolished, and a more practical building designed by Allies and Morrison to reflect the needs of the faculty was completed in 2004. The Alison Richard Building, completed in 2012 and designed by Nicholas Hare Architects, brings together a number of different research groups (Interdisciplinary Geographical Centres), the new department of Politics and International Studies (POLIS) and the Centre for Research in Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities (CRASSH). The Alison Richard Building On 29 October 2006, Education Not For Sale supporters at Cambridge University organised the first occupation in the UK in protest at the introduction of top-up fees on the Sidgwick Site Lecture Hall, occupying it for 12 hours. In 2009, Cambridge Gaza Solidarity occupied three lecture theatres and the common area of the Law Faculty., Cambridge News, 25 January 2009. Although less popular now, the site was formerly a thriving location with the local skateboarding community because of its undercover benches, numerous sets of stairs and L-shaped concrete banks. These features have since been amended to discourage skateboarding.

Mintz. Book Two, page 124. Silk Pagoda (2006). ) was the 24th king of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. Background He was the son of Buyeo Gonji, the younger brother of the 22nd king Munju who returned to Baekje from Yamato Japan in 477 after hearing of the fall of the Baekje capital. Gonji died in that year, and like Munju may have been murdered by Hae Gu. Dongseong appears to have been promoted to the throne by the Jin clan that prevailed over Hae Gu's rebellion. After Samgeun died without children, the throne passed to Dongseong. Reign He worked to strengthen the court's power after the move of the capital from the present- day Seoul area to Ungjin. He built several fortresses and castles to build out the new capital. He incorporated the local Sa, Yeon, and Baek clans into the court to counter the entrenched aristocracy from the former capital. Dongseong sent a tribute mission to the Southern Qi in 484, reopening Baekje‚Äôs ties with southern China after a long hiatus. He established an alliance with Silla through his marriage of a Silla noblewoman in 493, and the two countries united in attacking Goguryeo in 495. In 498, the Baekje army subjugated Tamna, the kingdom on Jeju island which had formally accepted Baekje rule twenty-two years before, because it failed to send tributes. The Book of Qi states that Dongseong sent armies to Liaodong and Liaoxi (ÏöîÏÑú ÈÅºË•ø) in China to defeat Goguryeo forces. Death Beginning in 499, the country was stricken by famine, but according to the Samguk Sagi the king was unresponsive. He continued to live an indulgent lifestyle while brigandage spread. By the end of Dongseong's rule, the local clans of the new capital had eclipsed the traditionally powerful Hae and Jin clans, and even pressured the throne. Dongseong sought to contain them by exiling Baek Ga to an outlying castle. This caused great resentment, and Baek Ga's forces assassinated Dongseong while he was hunting.

She was a Communist and belonged to a group of artists known as the , which she had met at the Academy of Fine Arts in Krak√≥w. Her works were evoked by her experiences as a Jew in Nazi-occupied Poland. She and her parents went to Warsaw, but they were murdered by a Polish bandit, while they were trying to find a safe place. She was severely wounded, but survived. After the war she was confronted with the reality of Communism. Having idealized it earlier, she ran into conflict with it. In later life Rosenstein published a book of her memoirs and several volumes of poetry. Rosenstein's brother, the Austrian professor Paul N.

Odin taking the dead Sinfj«´tli to Valhalla Sinfj√∂tli (Sinfj«´tli in Old Norse orthography) or Fitela (in Old English) in Norse mythology was born out of the incestuous relationship between Sigmund and his sister Signy. He had the half-brothers Sigurd, Helgi Hundingsbane and Hamund. Orthography In the standardized Old Norse orthography, the name is spelled Sinfj«´tli, but the letter '«´' is frequently replaced with the Modern Icelandic √∂ for reasons of familiarity or technical expediency. Life In Beowulf, Fitela is the nephew of Sigmund, whereas the V√∂lsunga saga describes him as both Sigmund's son and nephew due to incest. In the V√∂lsunga saga, Sinfj«´tli is the grandson of King V√∂lsung. Sign√Ω, King V√∂lsung's daughter, despises her husband King Siggeir, and begs \\"that she may not be made to return to King Siggeir.\\" V√∂lsung denies her request to leave, reminding her of the commitment their family must maintain. Despite a warning from Sign√Ω, King V√∂lsung and his 10 sons engage in a battle as King Siggeir's unbeatable army treacherously murders King V√∂lsung. Sign√Ω pleads with her husband not to dispose of her 10 brothers, but rather Siggeir grants her request \\"because [he thinks] it better that they suffer more and are tortured longer before they die.\\" Through 9 long nights, a returning she- wolf (thought to be King Siggeir's mother) kills 9 of Sign√Ω's brothers in turn. A message is passed to the last brother remaining, Sigmund, to smear honey on his face and bite the tongue out of the she-wolf's mouth, thus killing her and saving himself. Since Sigmund has lost his father and brothers, Sign√Ω wishes to support him in avenging their family by sending her son to be his companion in his hideout in the forest. However, each of her sons by King Siggeir proves cowardly: they cannot withstand the pain of having the cuffs of their kirtles sewn to their skin. So Sign√Ω has Sigmund kill them as they are no longer of any use. Sigmund being of the V√∂lsung line, Sign√Ω believes her brother will produce a son worthy of claiming a place in that line, and one night she \\"exchange[s] shape\\" with a v√∂lva, goes to Sigmund in his underground dwelling, and spends three nights in his bed with Sigmund unaware that she is his sister in another form. Very unlike her previous sons born of the devious and unpleasant King Siggeir, Sign√Ω then bears a son who is no less strong, handsome, and fearless than V√∂lsung himself. This is Sinfj«´tli, who together with Sigmund will avenge their clan by killing Siggeir. Sinfj«´tli ignores the pain, saying that \\"such pain would seem trifling to V√∂lsung.\\" The incestuous product of the coalesced V√∂lsung line, he is capable of the great deeds Signy requires. Sigmund and Sinfj«´tli go to Hunaland where Sigmund is proclaimed king of the Huns. He marries Borghild and has the sons Helgi Hundingsbane and H√°mundr. Sinfj√∂tli slays Borghild's brother while vying for a woman both the brother and Sinfj«´tli want. Borghild avenges her brother by poisoning Sinfj√∂tli. In order to dispose of him, Borghild gives Sigmund three cups of wine, of which the last contains poison. Sigmund, suspecting Borghild drinks two of the cups, but inebriated, encourages Sinfj«´tli to drink the third, which he does, and subsequently dies. Sigmund brings his son's corpse to the fjords, where he meets Odin disguised as a ferryman. the ferryman says that he can only take one passenger at a time and takes Sinfj«´tli's body first. Out on the water, he and Sinfj«´tli disappear, and go to Valhalla. Sigmund goes home and banishes Borghild. This is roughly the tale told in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Legend of Sigurd and Gudr√∫n. In the First Lay of Helgi Hundingsbane, from the Poetic Edda, Gudmund accuses Sinfj«´tli of being a werewolf.

The military leader of the uprising was Krsto Zrnov Popoviƒá and its political leader was Jovan Plamenac. The catalyst for the uprising was the decision of the controversial Grand People's Assembly in Montenegro, commonly known as the Podgorica Assembly, to unify the Kingdom of Montenegro unconditionally with the Kingdom of Serbia, which would immediately after form the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Following a questionable candidate selection process, the unionist Whites outnumbered the Greens, who favored preserving Montenegrin statehood and unification into a confederal Yugoslavia. The uprising reached a climax in Cetinje on 7 January 1919, the date of Orthodox Christmas. The unionists, with support from the Serbian Army, defeated the rebel Greens. In the aftermath of the uprising, the dethroned King Nicholas I was forced to issue a call for peace, many homes were destroyed and a number of participants in the uprising were tried and imprisoned. Some of the rebels fled to the Kingdom of Italy, while others retreated to the mountains, continuing a guerrilla resistance under the banner of the Montenegrin Army in Exile which lasted until 1929, most notably the militia of Savo Raspopoviƒá (hr). Background Krsto Zrnov Popoviƒá was one of the leaders of the uprising. Multiple historians acknowledge that a majority of Montenegrins supported the unification with other Southern Slavs on a federal basis after the World War I. However, support for unification did not involve the same degree of support for the Podgorica Assembly, since many of those who supported unification wanted Montenegro to join the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes as an autonomous entity, ultimately in a confederation rather than a centralized Serbian kingdom. Plan The plan of the Greens consisted of six points. * Vojvoda ƒêuro Petroviƒá, leading several rebel battalions, was to take the town of Nik≈°iƒá. From there, they were to march through ƒåevo and Cuce to Cetinje, in unison with rebels from Njegu≈°i. * General Milutin Vuƒçiniƒá, leading troops from Piperi, Lje≈°kopolje and Zeta, was to attack Podgorica and move towards Cetinje, crossing through Lje≈°anska nahija. His troops were to meet up with the troops of vojvoda ƒêuro Petroviƒá between ƒåevo and Lje≈°anska nahija. * Jovan Plamenac, leading troops from Crmnica, and with the support of detachments from Ljubotinj, was to head towards Cetinje. The three groups were to attack Cetinje simultaneously to disarm the Serbian troops there, and terminate them in case of resistance. In the case of a victory, the plan was to transport captured Serbians to the island of Lesendro in Lake Skadar. Rebels were instructed to carry food for three days, and the government in exile in Neuilly-sur-Seine was requested to provide food for 15,000 people for twenty days, a uniform for those currently without one, rifles, machine guns, ammunition and several cannons. They were to send the food and equipment to a place near Lake Skadar. * When the entirety of Montenegro is freed, the government in exile would begin sending food more regularly to the civilian population. * Expecting a counter-attack from the Vasojeviƒái and Serbians, the government in exile was requested to facilitate the creation of bands of Albanian fighters which would attack them between Peƒá and Plav. For this reason, the government in exile was to supply Jovan Plamenac with 1.200.000 francs. * The government in exile was to inform the world of the public opinion in Montenegro. This plan was delivered to Antonio Baldacci on 14 December 1918. Rebellion =Fighting around Podgorica= The rebellion first broke out around Podgorica. Some Martiniƒái headed by commanders Stevan and Bogiƒá Radoviƒá took control of Spu≈æ Fortress. The Piperi headed by Brigadier General Milutin Vuƒçiniƒá severed the road between Danilovgrad and Podgorica at Vraniƒáke Njive. Commander Andrija and Captain Mato Raiƒçeviƒá seized Velje Brdo overlooking Podgorica. Since most Bjelopavliƒái were supporters of the unification, the rebels who occupied Spu≈æ Fortress were quickly forced to capitulate with no bullets fired. The leaders were detained and their troops were sent home. The Bjelopavliƒái, for the most part consisting of the youth, continued toward Podgorica. They were met at Vraniƒáke Njive by Vuƒçiniƒá, where fighting would have probably broken out, had the youth of Podgorica, Piperi and Kuƒçi not simultaneously reached his troops from behind. Vuƒçiniƒá was surrounded, and ordered his troops to lay down their arms. The leaders were, again, detained and transported to Podgorica, and the troops sent home. The same happened at Velje Brdo. The defeat at Podgorica would prove to be a strong setback for the rebels, since the troops that were disarmed were supposed to help with the sieges of Nik≈°iƒá and Cetinje. Also, the rebels seemed less united and less willing, which had its toll on the confidence of the Greens in other areas. =Fighting around Nik≈°iƒá= The town of Nik≈°iƒá was surrounded on but no fighting broke out until the afternoon of 5 January. The siege was led from one side by Major ≈†ƒáepan Miju≈°koviƒá, a veteran of several previous wars. During the morning, the rebels delivered an ultimatum to the town's defenders to send their commanders to the new brewery by the Bistrica river. Shots were fired first from Trebjesa hill, and after from ƒåaƒëelica, Glavica and from around the brewery. The town's youth organized a council where Dr Niko Martinoviƒá was elected president, and Marko Kavaja, later screenwriter, secretary. Some veterans also joined, however the troops in the town under the command of Captain Stojiƒá lost contact with Cetinje and stood down. Stojiƒá armed the youth with one machine gun. Kavaja went to negotiate with the rebels in Pandurica, in the company of a POW, the brother of Radojica Nikƒçeviƒá, one of the rebel leaders. He claims that the rebels were not opposed to the unification, but were fighting for their \\"honorable vojvodas and serdars\\". The negotiations failed to stop the fighting. At sunset, the siege was relieved by Bjelopavliƒái forces. After hearing that more reinforcements from Grahovo were coming to the aid of the defenders, many rebels deserted. The Drobnjaci arrived late to the defense, being sidetracked by bad weather. After the fighting had ended, several rebel leaders were captured including ƒêuro and Marko Petroviƒá, and former Defense Minister Marko ƒêukanoviƒá. Misja Nikoliƒá and Brigadier General ƒêuro Jovoviƒá escaped, having went into hiding and crossed into Italy, respectively. =Siege of Virpazar= Unrest started around the Crmnica town of Virpazar on , where the supporters of King Nicholas were led by Jovan Plamenac. According to Commander Jago≈° Dra≈°koviƒá, Plamenac approached Virpazar in the morning of 3 January with over 400 men, while Dra≈°koviƒá defended the town with around 350. The number of defenders increased during the day, and Plamenac hoped to reach the Italian troops further to the south for supplies and ammunition. Since Dra≈°koviƒá placed his troops between Plamenac and the Italians, Plamenac agreed to meet with Dra≈°koviƒá, who was accompanied by Dr Bla≈æo Lekiƒá, leader of the Crmnica youth and an older local, Stanko ƒêuroviƒá. Plamenac agreed to send his men home, in return for a letter guaranteeing his safe passage to Cetinje after his men disbanded. Dra≈°koviƒá concludes that Plamenac agreed to disband his troops because he was unsure of his victory, and because his plan was to deal with Virpazar and Rijeka Crnojeviƒáa quickly, after which his troops in the area could join the siege of Cetinje, which was planned to be over by 5 January. Since this proved impossible, he counted on improving the Greens' odds with Cetinje by appearing in person and in the company of at least a few men. Plamenac disbanded most of his troops in the evening of 3 January, and proceeded to his native village of Boljeviƒái with around 60 men, who planned to march on Cetinje the following day. On 4 January, Andrija Radoviƒá stopped in Virpazar while returning from Shkod√´r, where he held a speech in front of the Crmnica locals. He threatened Plamenac, and pointed out that he was now decorated with more foreign honors than the late Ilija Plamenac. Dra≈°koviƒá considers this speech to have acted to the detriment of the White cause, primarily because it enraged the locals who held Ilija Plamenac in high regard. Because of this new situation, Jovan Plamenac started rallying his men again. In the evening of 4 January, Dra≈°koviƒá marched on Boljeviƒái with around 150 men, but Plamenac had already retreated toward Seoca and Krnjice. Dra≈°koviƒá returned to Virpazar and boarded his men on a ship headed for Krnjice, where he attacked Plamenac and his troops. The Greens retreated into Skadarska Krajina, and crossed the Bojana to join the Italian troops in Albania. =Fighting around Rijeka Crnojeviƒáa= Though a minor hamlet, Rijeka Crnojeviƒáa was central to the Greens' plan. After its fall, troops from the area were to launch a serious strike on Cetinje. The town was surrounded on by troops under the command of Commander ƒêuro ≈†oƒá. The towns defenders were led by Brigade General Niko Pejanoviƒá and, though low in number, held their positions. The first day of the siege, Pejanoviƒá wrote to one of the Greens' commanders to call off the attack. ≈†oƒá wrote to the local command, the head of the srez and the president of the municipality. He requested that the defenders produce three hostages, evacuate all Serbian troops and provided that the defenders leave Rijeka Crnojeviƒáa armed, after which he guaranteed that they would be escorted to Shkod√´r with honor. He states in his letters that Montenegro had been \\"sold for Judas' silver\\" and that while being the \\"torch of Serb freedom\\", it was occupied by \\"brotherly ≈†umadijans who replaces the Austro-Hungarians\\". His claims that 35,000 Montenegrins were participating in the uprising and that Virpazar was already conquered were widely overstated. During the night, reinforcements arrived from Podgorica to lift the siege. According to Jovan ƒÜetkoviƒá, member of the Podgorica Assembly, the youth of Podgorica met with the Greens during the night around Carev Laz near Rva≈°i. After a short verbal confrontation, leaders of the youth agreed to negotiate with the Greens in Rva≈°i. Todor Bo≈æoviƒá, Captain Jovan Vuksanoviƒá and Podgorica Assembly MP Nikola Kovaƒçeviƒá‚ÄìMizara proceeded to Rva≈°i accompanied by 5-6 other members of the youth. The rest set up camp near Carev Laz and were led by Captain Radojica Damjanoviƒá and flag-bearer Nikola Dragoviƒá. There, they met Captains ƒêuza ƒêura≈°koviƒá and Marko Radunoviƒá who were waiting for a negotiator from the Greens. They waited in Rva≈°i until daybreak, when a group went toward Rijeka to the village of Dru≈°iƒái. They found serdar Joko Joviƒáeviƒá who summoned a local, Captain ƒêuko Kostiƒá, and initiated negotiations between the two groups. In the morning of 4 January, while the groups were negotiating, the youth decided to push forward contrary to the command of Todor Bo≈æoviƒá. They met the Greens under the command of Captain Jovan Vujoviƒá in the village of ≈†inƒëon, near Rijeka Crnojeviƒáa, where the Greens held higher ground. The Greens realized that, while initially outnumbering the town's defenders, they were now outnumbered. They agreed to send their men home and salute to the Whites' flag, which was highly unpopular among the rebel troops. After breaking the siege of Rijeka Crnojeviƒáa, the Whites achieved an extremely significant victory and by 5 January, troops under the command of Serbian General Dragutin Milutinoviƒá had both ended a minor uprising in Rijeka Crnojeviƒáa and had stopped a larger attack on Nik≈°iƒá. =Siege of Cetinje= As Jovan Plamenac and the other rebel leaders had planned, Cetinje turned out to be the epicenter of the uprising. After several days of exchanging letters, the rebels began forming armed squads on 1918. The rebels gathered in front of the House of Government on 1 January 1919 and left town for the hills. Recruits were called to arms by ringing the church bells in the vicinity of Cetinje. By 2 January, Cetinje was surrounded from all sides. According to ƒÜetkoviƒá, the town was, at this moment in time, defended by around 100 members of the national guard i.e 20‚Äì30 men each from several tribes around Cetinje, 50‚Äì60 members of the youth, 50 gendarmes and policemen and 100 members of the 2nd Yugoslav Regiment under Colonel Dragutin Milutinoviƒá. The troops were lacking in ammunition, and every defender had between 50 and 100 rounds. Milutinoviƒá's troops were armed with two cannons and around 1,000 shells. Youth leader Marko Dakoviƒá requested that Milutinoviƒá deliver arms to his troops, but since he was himself lacking in arms and ammunition, he directed Dakoviƒá toward the commander of the Second Army stationed in Sarajevo, vojvoda Stepa Stepanoviƒá. The telephone lines were still operational and Stepanoviƒá allowed Dakoviƒá to restock from the army garrison in Tivat. During 2 January, leader of the Lje≈°anska national guard Lieutenant Radoje ƒÜetkoviƒá reached Tivat and returned with around 2,000 rifles and ample ammunition. The following day, on 3 January, a delegation headed by Brigade Generals Milutin Vukotiƒá and Jovo Beƒáir went to negotiate with the rebel leaders at their headquarters in the village of Bajice. According to General Milutinoviƒá, the negotiations were unsuccessful and he went to negotiate personally around 2 P.M. Milutinoviƒá met Commander ƒêuro Dra≈°koviƒá and Lieutenant Ilija Beƒáir, the latter of whom he describes as insolent for having said \\"Either the Serbians () leave Montenegro or there will be blood, there isn't and there cannot be any other way\\". In his return, Milutinoviƒá met his troops who begged him to attack Bajice, but their request was denied because he \\"still hoped that everything would end peacefully\\". In the morning of 4 January, serdar Janko Vukotiƒá arrived in Cetinje. He had broken through the rebels' advance guard with a force of 30 men from ƒåevo. Milutinoviƒá advised Vukotiƒá to make arrangements with the National Executive Committee, to allow him to try negotiating with the rebels in Bajice. The Committee agreed, and Vukotiƒá went to Bajice by car, accompanied with two captains and an MP of the Podgorica Assembly. The two captains returned on foot not long after with word that Vukotiƒá and the MP had been captured. Other than the capture of serdar Vukotiƒá and some gendarmes encountering a minor roadblock on their way to the villages of Kosijeri and Jabuka, no fighting took place on that day. On 5 January, a list of requests written by Krsto Popoviƒá a day earlier was delivered to Milutinoviƒá, asking for the termination of resolutions by the Podgorica Assembly. Milutinoviƒá replied to him the next day, alleging that he was responsible for his troops in Montenegro, but also promised to bring Popoviƒá's requests to the government in Belgrade. On 6 January 1919, around 250 Serbian troops and 850 volunteers from nearby Montenegrin tribes fought a formation of approximately 1,500 to 2,000 rebel Greens in Cetinje. That day, the Greens initiated a siege on Cetinje, killing some members of the Great National Assembly and killing some Whites. After that, the Greens experienced severe factionalism, in addition to facing the militarily stronger Whites. International influence and reactions =Italian role= As a result of the Podgorica Assembly, King Nicholas was exiled to the Kingdom of Italy, from which the uprising enjoyed substantial support. King Nicholas's Ministers asked for the Italian Expedition Corps in Albania to enter Montenegro, \\"in order for it to be liberated solely by Italian troops\\".≈Ωivojinoviƒá, Dragoljub: Pitanje Crne Gore i mirovna konferencija 1919 [The Issue of Montenegro and the 1919 Peace Conference], Belgrade 1992, p. 7. See Rastoder, ≈†erbo: Crna Gora u egzilu [Montenegro in Exile], Podgorica 2004. A committee organized by Italian ethnographer Antonio Baldacci supported the Greens until at least 1921. In late November 1918 during the Podgorica Assembly, Italian troops attempted to take control of the coastal areas of Montenegro under the guise of Entente troop movement, but got prevented from doing so. =International response= In the spring of 1919, the United States sent Charles W. Furlong as an envoy from the Peace Commission to Montenegro. Furlong reported to The New York Times in an interview published on June 15, 1919, that the electors in the Podgorica Assembly acted as carpetbaggers did in the United States. An initiative called the Inter-Allied Commission of Investigation monitored the Podgorica Assembly and the Whites after the uprising. It included Louis Franchet d'Esp√®rey, as well as lieutenants from the United States, United Kingdom, and Italy. They recorded that there were as few as 500 unionist troops in Montenegro, and that they were not exclusively Serbian but from other constituents of the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. The commission also concluded from interviewing Greens held as prisoners that the uprising had been \\"caused by agents of King Nicholas I and supported by some emissaries from Italy.\\" Aftermath Later in the twentieth century, the Christmas Uprising was subject to ideological emphasis in Montenegrin nationalism. In World War II, one of the earliest leaders of the Greens, Sekula Drljeviƒá, invited the Italian occupation of Montenegro and collaborated with the Independent State of Croatia in order to break away from Yugoslavia. Since Montenegro declared independence from Serbia in 2006, the Christmas Uprising has been memorialized on polar opposite ends of the Montenegrin historical conscious. In 1941, a memorial on the burial site of unionist Whites was destroyed by the Italian occupation of Montenegro in Cetinje. As of 2017, a walkway was paved on the same burial site in Cetinje without any recognition to the Whites. On 7 January 2008, on the 90th anniversary of the uprising, Montenegrin Prime Minister Milo ƒêukanoviƒá revealed a memorial statue for the Greens who were killed in the insurrection.

Parliamentary assistants usually work at the House of Commons in the UK Parliament or in their MP's constituency office. Duties The duties of parliamentary assistants vary significantly depending on the MPs they work for and their position in Parliament; but generally they facilitate the day-to-day working life of their MP and make it as efficient as possible. The office in which a parliamentary assistant is based may determine the type of work they do. Alternative titles and pay MPs may distinguish between parliamentary assistants in terms of seniority. For example, some MPs differentiate between parliamentary assistants and senior parliamentary assistants. Parliamentary assistants may also be called parliamentary researchers if they are principally tasked with conducting research. Salaries for MPs' staff are set by the MP they work for, but must be within the bounds of the pay scales set by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority. Controversies In recent years, there has been controversy over the tradition of MPs hiring their family members as parliamentary assistants. In 2017, it was revealed that one in five MPs employed a member of their family, despite the practice being banned for new MPs before the 2017 general election.

It was developed for the task of clearing heavily fortified areas such as the Siegfried Line and as a result favoured armour protection over mobility. Although heavy, at 78 tons, and not readily transported, it was considered reliable and a good gun platform. Only a few prototypes of the Tortoise had been produced by the end of the war.  Development  Diamond T's during trials in BAOR, 1948 In the early part of 1943, the Allied forces anticipated considerable resistance in the projected future invasion of Europe, with the enemy fighting from heavily fortified positions such as the Siegfried Line. As a result, a new class of vehicles emerged, in the shape of assault tanks, which placed maximum armour protection at a higher priority than mobility. Initially, work was concentrated on the Excelsior tank (A33), based on the Cromwell tank. There was also a programme to upgrade the armour of the Churchill tank. For similar work in the Far East, the Valiant tank (A38), based on the Valentine tank was considered, although weight was specified to be as low as possible. The Secretary of State for War and the Minister of Supply issued a Joint Memorandum in April 1943 that gave a vague specification for an assault tank, classing it as a special purpose vehicle to operate in heavily defended areas as part of the specialist 79th Armoured Division. The Nuffield Organisation responded with 18 separate designs (AT1 through AT18) drafted between May 1943 and February 1944, each design larger and heavier than the last. By February 1944, design AT16 was complete and was approved by the Tank Board, who proposed that month that 25 should be produced directly from the mockup stage without bothering with a prototype, to be available for operational service in September 1945. An order for 25 was placed by the War Office and work was begun. Following the end of the war the order was reduced and only six vehicles were built. One example was sent to Germany for trials, where it was found to be mechanically reliable and a powerful and accurate gun platform. However, at a weight of 80 tons and a height of it was extremely slow and proved difficult to transport. Description The primary requirement for an assault tank is armour, to enable the tank to assault a heavily emplaced enemy. This led to Tortoise having very thick armour, arranged as a one piece casemate to avoid the weak spots of a turret design. This differs from the design of other wartime era assault tanks, the Excelsior tank and Assault Tank T14. Since the Tortoise had a fixed casemate superstructure instead of a turret, it can be classified as a self-propelled gun or an assault gun and not a tank. The crew included a commander, driver, and gunner, with two loaders for the 32-pounder gun and two machine gunners. Internally, it was split into three compartments: the transmission to the front, the crew in the centre and the Rolls-Royce Meteor engine at the rear. The suspension consisted of four bogies on each side of the hull. Each bogie had two pairs of wheels, with each pair linked to a transverse torsion bar. The Merritt-Brown transmission was fitted with an all speed reverse, giving approximately the same speed backwards as forwards. Armament The Ordnance QF 32 pounder gun design was adapted from the British 3.7 inch anti-aircraft gun. The ammunition used a separate charge and shell, the latter a 32-pound (14.5 kg) armour piercing shot (APCBC). In tests, the gun was successful against a German Panther tank at nearly 1,000 yards. The 32-pdr gun was mounted in a power-assisted limited traverse mounting; rather than being mounted on the more traditional trunnions, it protruded through a large ball mount in the front of the hull, protected by 225 mm armour. To the left of it was a Besa machine gun in an armoured ball mount. A further two Besa machine guns were mounted in a turret on the top of the hull to the right. Surviving prototypes The Tortoise at The Tank Museum (2008) *One of the six prototype Tortoises constructed of mild steel has been preserved at The Tank Museum in Bovington, England. The vehicle is in running condition. A 2011 overhaul saw it running under its own power for the first time since the 1950s. It was shown to the public in June 2011 at Tankfest 2011, the Bovington museum's annual display of running vehicles. *A Tortoise, without its gun, lies on the Kirkcudbright military training area near Kirkcudbright, Scotland. Other damage to the tank and the designation of the Kirkcudbright training area as a Site of Special Scientific Interest mean that removal of the Tortoise to a museum is unlikely. *Another Tortoise was used as a target on Lulworth Ranges, Dorset in the early 1970s. By August 1974 it was little more than a shell.

It is a ball game that can be played indoors or outdoors in a court divided by a low net with two opposing teams (one, two or three players) who try to score a point hitting the ball with any part of their body except for the hands and making it bounce in the opponent's area in a way that makes it difficult or impossible for the other team to return it over the net. History In 1922 the members of the football club Slavia Prague started playing a game which they called football over the rope, because it was initially played over a horizontally suspended rope, which was later replaced by a net. Usually two or three players on each side could touch the ball three times (not two consecutive touches by the same player) with all parts of the body except for the arms and could let the ball bounce once between the touches, altogether three times before passing it on the other side. In 1940 the first official rules were written. The first futnet cup was played in 1940 and between 1953-1961 first league called Trampsk√° liga was played and it was banterous. In 1961, futnet was recognised as an official sport by Czechoslovak Sports Organisation (ƒåSTV) and the Prague Futnet Commission was established. In 1971 the \\"ƒåesk√Ω nohejbalov√Ω svaz\\" (Czech Futnet Association) was founded and in 1974 \\"V√Ωbor nohejbalov√©ho zv√§zu S√öV ƒåSTV\\" (Slovak Futnet Association). Official international competitions have been organised for decades. European championships have been held since 1991 and World championships since 1994.  Rules  There are three futnet disciplines: *Single: one player, two touches, one bounce in all categories, court dimensions 9 m √ó 12.8 m. *Double: two players, three touches (but not two consecutive touches by the same player), one bounce allowed for men and two bounces for women and juniors, court dimensions 9 m √ó 12.8 m. *Triple: three players, three touches (but not two consecutive touches by the same player), one bounce allowed for men and two for women and juniors, court dimensions 9 m √ó 18 m. In all the disciplines, a set finishes with 11th point with a two-point difference, maximum score is 15:14. To win a match, the team has to win 2 sets. The height of the net is 1.10 m. The players may not touch the net during the game, otherwise it is a point for the opponent. The futnet ball is similar to a football in size, but is glued, made of 32 panels, of synthetic (natural) leather and when properly inflated, should bounce more than half a meter. *If the ball hits the net and comes back to your side it cannot be hit back unlike volleyball  International associations  In 1987, the International Footballtennis Association (IFTA, later renamed to FIFTA, the Federation International de Footballtennis Association) was founded. In 2010, Union Internationale de Futnet (UNIF) was founded by some former FIFTA members, later joined by other nations, to govern, regulate and promote the sport of futnet. In December 2012, UNIF had 17 member countries. In April 2010 European Futnet Association (EFTA) was founded in Marseille, France, to reactivate the sport in Europe where it had been stagnating under FIFTA. Current EFTA members include Switzerland, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Ireland, Basque Country, Denmark, England, Poland, Ukraine and Austria. EFTA is the continental association of UNIF in Europe.  International name  While footballtennis is still a commonly used, the word futnet is being used more and more as the new international name to reflect the truly independent nature of this sport which has now almost 100 years of history and which has its own rules and regulations, governing structures and regular competitions.

Etymology The name is often derived from two elements, the Sanskrit: duh, meaning \\"bad or atrocious\\" and sasana, meaning \\"governance or reign\\". So the word Duhshasana means \\"A Bad Governance\\" or \\"An Atrocious Ruler\\". Birth and Early Life When Dhritarashtra's queen Gandhari's pregnancy continued for an unusually long time, she beat her womb in frustration and in envy of Kunti, the queen of Pandu, who had given birth to three of the five Pandava brothers. Due to her actions, a hardened mass of grey-coloured flesh emerged from her womb. Gandhari was devastated, and called upon Vyasa, the great sage who had blessed her with one hundred sons, to redeem his words. Dussasana was devoted to his older brother Duryodhana. He was also closely involved in the various schemes and plots to kill the Pandavas along with Duryodhana and Shakuni. Draupadi's humiliation Dushasana drags Draupadi to the court After Yudhishthira lost his kingdom, his brothers and his wife Draupadi, in a game of dice with Shakuni, Duhshasana dragged Draupadi by the hair into the assembly, at the behest of his brother Duryodhana, and tried to disrobe her. Draupadi prayed to Krishna and he made her sari to be of infinite length, so that Duhshasana could not take it off. Dussasana was very exhausted and he nearly fainted. The assembled men were amazed at this miracle. They condemned Duhshasana and praised Draupadi. However, Draupadi was humiliated by being dragged into court by her hair. After this humiliation Draupadi swore that she will not tie her hair until it is bathed with blood of Duhshasana. Bhima, who could no longer watch Draupadi's insult in silence, rose up. He vowed to tear open Dussasana's chest in battle and drink his blood. Bhima also exclaimed that if he could not fulfill his oath, then he would not meet his ancestors in heaven. Draupadi is presented to a Parcheesi game Kurukshetra war and death He along with Duryodhana lead one of the Akshauhanis of the Kaurava army. Dushasana was the warrior who shot the first arrow in the war. On the first day of the war, Dushasana had fought with Nakula. On the tenth day, Dushasana was appointed on the frontlines to defend Bhishma from the Pandava army. Dushasana exhibited his valor on that day by resisting all the Pandavas single-handedly. But later, Arjuna managed to defeat him. On the thirteenth day, Dushasana was present in the Chakravyuha. After a fierce duel, Abhimanyu badly defeated Dushasana and his charioteer had to take him away from the battlefield. The son of Dushasana who helped his father many times in the Kurukshetra war. He was also present inside the Chakra Vyuh on the thirteenth day of the war. He was deprived of his chariot by Abhimanyu and saved by Aswathamma by cutting Abhimanyu's arrow in mid air. After that, Durmasena killed Abhimanyu in a mace duel. On 14th day, Durmasena was brutally killed by Draupadi's sons, the Upapandavas, in revenge for Abhimanyu. On the fourteenth day, Dushasana was appointed to defend Jayadratha. However, Arjuna vanquished Dushasana and proceeded to slay Jayadratha.he was also involved with his brothers against satyaki.though he fought brilliantly and once made s Satyaki unconscious. He was deprived and defeated By Satyaki thrice with his brothers and trigatars army. On 14th night he defeated Prathinvindhya. On the 15th day, Dushasana battled Sahdev and vanquished him. = Death = Bhima fulfilling his promise regarding Dussasana in the Mahabharata field On the sixteenth day, Dushasana encountered Bhima in a duel. Dushasana was showering arrows and pierced Bhima's armour. He severed his bow and standard and achieve some success. Then Bhima in wrath hurled a mace with full force which shattered Dushasana's chariot, kill his horses and charioteer and displace Dushasana out of chariot at distance of 10 bow length. On the ground, Bhima pressed his foot upon Dushasana's throat and asked him with which hand had he dragged Draupadi. Dushasana then proudly (shamelessly) raised his right arm and said that this was the same arm which dragged Draupadi in whole Kuru assembly. Enraged by this, Bhima seized Dushasana's right arm and uprooted it from his body while roaring loudly. Then (remembering his vow taken on dice game day), Bhima tore open Dushasana's chest with his bare hands and drank his hot blood. Many soldiers who saw Bhima drinking Dushasana's blood, had fallen unconscious and some soldiers that Bhima is a monster for drinking a human's blood. After that, Bhima beheaded Dushasana with his sword and Bhima danced around Dushasana's body. Dushasana's death had greatly agitated the Kauravas, especially Duryodhana who become numb. Bhima had given Dushasana one of the most brutal death in Mahabharata. After death of Dushashna 10 of his remaining brothers sought for revenge fight Bhima, but without any difficulty with 10 arrows Bhima sent them to yamaloka (abode of death.)

Orica has a workforce of around 11,500 employees and contractors, servicing customers across more than 100 countries. Orica is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (). It has in recent years been subject to a number of high profile industrial accidents and fatalities. History Initially founded in 1874 as Jones, Scott and Co., a supplier of explosives during the Victorian gold rush, the company was bought by Nobel Industries. Nobel later merged with several British chemical manufacturers to form Imperial Chemical Industries. In 1928, Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand (ICIANZ) was incorporated to acquire and coordinate all the Australasian interests of ICI Plc. In July 1997, ICI Australia became an independent Australasian company after its parent company, ICI Plc, divested its 62.4 per cent shareholding in the company. As a result of the selldown ICI Australia was required to change its name and on 2 February 1998 became known as Orica. In 2010, Orica successfully demerged Dulux Group leaving the company to focus on the provision of services to the mining, construction and infrastructure industries. In November 2014, Orica Limited announced the sale of its Chemicals business to the Blackstone Group. The sale was completed on 2 March 2015, and the Chemicals business now operates under the name 'Ixom'. Financial performance Orica's revenue in 2016 was AUD$5.1 billion and statutory net profit after tax (NPAT) attributable to the shareholders of Orica for the full year ended 30 September 2016 was $343 million. Sustainability Orica is a member of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), the Australian SAM Sustainability Index (AuSSI) and the FTSE4Good Index. These Indexes provide a benchmark for the performance of investments in sustainable companies and funds. Orica releases an annual Sustainability Report that outlines performance against key sustainability metrics. In 2014, Orica was identified as a global leader in Natural Capital Decoupling, which shows the ability of organisations to 'decouple' financial growth from environmental impact, by increasing revenue whilst decreasing their absolute impact. Markets/industries Orica operates across the following markets and industries: * Surface Metal * Surface Coal * Underground Mining * Underground Construction * Construction * Quarrying * Oil and Gas Products and services Orica operates three primary business areas: =Blasting= Orica is the world's largest provider of commercial explosives and blasting systems to the mining, quarrying, oil and gas and construction markets. =Products and services= * Contracted Services * Initiators * Boosters * Bulk Explosives * Packaged Explosives * Data, Reporting & Analytics * Supplementary Services * Seismic Systems Trade names used for packaged explosives include: Senatel‚Ñ¢, Fortel‚Ñ¢, Apex‚Ñ¢, Amex‚Ñ¢, Impact‚Ñ¢, Simex‚Ñ¢, Powergel‚Ñ¢ and Eurodyn‚Ñ¢. \\"Power Gel\\" was a U.S. Registered Trademark for Hercules Inc. in 1967, but it is now owned by Orica Explosives Technology Pty Ltd.http://tmsearch.uspto.gov Reg.No. 72286670, 11 Dec 1967http://tmsearch.uspto.gov Reg.No. 78327856, 13 Nov 2003 =Minova= Minova is a member of the Orica Group.

It is one of the few post-war office buildings to be found on the Victorian Heritage Register. Incidents =Corporate= Bullying scandal In March 2015 then CEO Ian Smith was ousted from the business due to bullying of a female employee. During Smiths tenure as CEO, the majority of the senior leadership within the organization left for other companies. =In Australia= Botany, New South Wales =Organochlorines in the Botany aquifer= Remediation began in 2005 after production of chlorinated solvents by ICI over many years resulted in significant contamination of the aquifer, a high-quality sand aquifer located below the eastern suburbs of Sydney, New South Wales. The main chemical contaminant found in groundwater around the old ICI site is EDC (1,2-dichloroethane), a persistent organic pollutant and byproduct of the manufacture of PVC. Orica has built an A$167 million Groundwater Treatment Plant (GTP) to achieve containment of this contamination and provide high quality industrial water to Botany Industrial Park. Water produced by Orica's GTP saves Sydney's potable water supply around per day (approx 0.5% of Sydney's water demand). Residents in the area were banned from accessing the groundwater. Orica estimated in 2012 that the GTP had been in operation for seven years of its 30year design life cycle. =Mercury leak, 2011= The Botany chemical plant released mercury vapour into the atmosphere on 27 September 2011, breaching environmental standards for nine hours. An air monitor located near residents at detected the mercury vapour and the Office of Environment and Heritage was notified. Dr Mariann Lloyd Smith, said the length of time the emissions last was extraordinary, \\"Mercury is extremely toxic. It is recognised as one of the most important and most hazardous toxins that we deal with, and there is currently a UN negotiation for a global treaty on mercury to address this,\\" she said. The mercury vapour was associated with mercury which had polluted the soil on the Orica site, due to leaking pipes. Robyn Parker, the New South Wales Minister for the Environment & Heritage said \\"I am incredibly angry and disappointed that yet again we have another incident with Orica.\\" In January 2013, the NSW EPA announced that it would conduct a review of off-site emissions of mercury. =Mercury leak, 2012= On 17 January 2012 Orica reported a mercury leak at its Port Botany plant, the second mercury incident since August 2011. In a series of samples of environmental air, the EPA recorded a mercury level of ; more than double the regulatory limit of . The leak occurred in December 2011 and Orica failed to report the leak to authorities until the following month. The site of the breach was the thermal desorbtion stack at the company's carpark waste remediation project, which was closed when the breach occurred. The NSW Environmental Protection Authority said the incident was not linked to the mercury emissions breach in September at Orica's other Botany site on Beauchamp Road. Gladstone, Queensland =Cyanide leaks, 2012= On 8 June 2012 the Queensland Department of Environment launched a legal prosecution against Orica in the Gladstone Magistrates' Court. The company was charged with 279 counts of willfully contravening its approvals in relation to alleged cyanide leaks into Harbour. The government claimed that in January and February 2012, Orica discharged effluent water containing heightened levels of cyanide into Gladstone Harbour. \\"The charges are related to allegations that the company did not inform The Department of the Environment. The charges related to a breach of conditions rather than any environmental harm per se\\". Kooragang, New South Wales Throughout August and December 2011 Orica had six major chemicals incidents or leaks in Australia. The first one was a leak of hexavalent chromium from its ammonium nitrate plant near Stockton that affected 70 households; the second one was the release of arsenic into the Hunter River at Newcastle; the third was of mercury vapours from its Botany site; the fourth was a leak of ammonia from its site at Kooragang; the fifth was an ammonium nitrate leak of at its Kooragang Island plant, only a day after being allowed to reopen; and the sixth incident was a sulphuric acid leak of approximately at its Port Kembla site. The fourth leak triggered a public forum and NSW Government investigation into the leaks, and the temporary shut down of the Kooragang Island plant. =Hexavalent chromium leak, 2011= Orica's Kooragang Island chemical plant released hexavalent chromium into the atmosphere on 8 August 2011. The known carcinogen was released between 6 and 6:30pm and the spill continued for approximately 20 minutes. An estimated of hexavalent chromium was discharged from the Orica plant, with another over the suburb of Stockton. Approximately 20 workers at the plant were exposed as well as 70 nearby homes in Stockton. Orica failed to notify government authorities until 16 hours after the incident and residents were not formally notified for three days. Under a Prevention Notice issued on 11 August 2011, the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH) closed the ammonia plant at Kooragang Island. The hexavalent chromium leak was the subject of a New South Wales Parliament Upper House inquiry, that was concluded in February 2012. =Hunter River arsenic leak, 2011= Effluent containing high levels of arsenic leaked into the Hunter River from the Kooragang Island chemical plant on 19 August 2011 at 3pm. Arsenic had not been used on the site since 1993, however during a cleanup of a hexavalent chromium spill on the site the week prior, old deposits of arsenic leaked into a storage pond and drained into the Hunter River. It was estimated the arsenic concentration was 0.067 milligrams per litre, exceeding licence limits. Barry O'Farrell, the NSW Premier said \\"two spills in a fortnight raise reasonable concerns about systemic failures in the way in which this company is operating its facilities.\\" O'Farrell continued, \\"I've had a gutful of families being distressed, by potential threats to their safety and threats to their local environment.\\" =Ammonia leak, 2011= On 9 November 2011 more than of ammonia was initially suspected of venting to the atmosphere from the Kooragang Island plant during a 45-minute period. The venting was due to a relief valve operating to prevent overpressure of a liquid ammonia tank. Engineering studies subsequently revised the amount down to ~. The leak was identified by firefighters responding to an alarm raised by the hospitalisation of two railway workers at who were affected by the plume of escaping gas. Six fire units and a hazardous chemicals unit were called to the chemical plant to deal with the leak of the ammonia gas. Despite initial statements by Orica that the leak posed no public health risk, two rail workers in the nearby suburb of were overcome by ammonia fumes and were taken to hospital with breathing difficulties. Less than an hour before the ammonia leak, the Environment Protection Authority announced it would take Orica to court over the hexavalent chromium leak which occurred on 8 August 2011 at the same plant. =Ammonium nitrate leak, 2011= On 7 December 2011, in excess of of weak ammonium nitrate (<35%) solution/fertilizer leaked onto grassed areas at the Kooragang Island chemical plant. Emergency services were called to the site including a HAZMAT team. The spill occurred less than a day after the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would allow the reopening of part of the Kooragang Island plant. Local residents continued to criticise the company for failing to notify residents in a timely manner and called for the plant to remain closed. =Hydrogen stack fire, 2012= On 8 January 2012 lightning ignited hydrogen being released from the plant. Flames higher than leapt from the hydrogen stack and were reported by local residents to authorities. Port Kembla, New South Wales =Sulphuric acid leak, 2011= A spill of approximately of concentrated sulphuric acid occurred at the chemical plant on 16 December 2011. The leak was suspected to be caused by a hole in the ship-to-shore pipeline. Acting chief environmental regulator Mark Gifford from the NSW EPA said he was concerned about the ongoing incidents with Orica. =In Mexico= Coahuila =Explosion, 2007= On 10 September 2007, 28 people were killed and over 250 injured in Coahuila, Mexico, as a result of an accident between a pick-up and a truck which resulted in an explosion. The truck was transporting about 25 metric tons of dynamite under contract for the company Orica near the cities of Monclova and Cuatro Cienegas. Exact numbers of the dead and injured vary according to source. Orica's website stated there were a total of 28 fatalities in 2007 - one worker and 27 contractors/members of the public.

History St Leonard's parish church The original name was \\"Saundruage\\" meaning a place of sandy soil serviced by bond tenants. The earliest recorded mention of Sandridge is in the year 796 the parish being part of the revenue of the Mercian Kings. It was given by Egfrith son of Offa in the first year of his reign to abbot Eadric second abbot of St Alban's Monastery and to the monks of St Albans. Part of the parish of Sandridge was added to the Municipal Borough of St Albans in 1887. The remainder of the parish was renamed Sandridge Rural in 1894 when Sandridge Rural Parish Council was formed. In 1913 a further 241 acres were transferred to St Albans. The parish name reverted to Sandridge in 1957. Second Battle of St Albans In February 1461 the final skirmishes of the Second Battle of St Albans took place in and around Sandridge as the Earl of Warwick, for the Yorkists, retreated towards Nomansland. Information Hopkins Crescent in Sandridge pictured in November 2013.The population of Sandridge ward at the time of the 2001 census was 4,808. This includes some people living in the Jersey Farm area of St Albans. The village has three pubs: the Green Man, the Rose and Crown and the Queen's Head. The village church, St Leonard's, is medieval. Its lychgate was built as a memorial to World War I. It also supports Sandridge Rovers F.C., who play in the Hertfordshire Senior County League. Sandridge was one of the earlier homes of the great English general, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, and his infamous wife, Sarah, a favourite of Queen Anne. The title Baron Sandridge was given to Churchill by James II in 1685, and was his first English peerage title (his earlier title, Baron Eyemouth, had been created in 1682 by James's predecessor, Charles II, in the Peerage of Scotland). In 1939 the first Second World War secret Wireless Intercept Station was constructed by the GPO at the top of Woodcock Hill. It was the first of a group of stations dedicated to Diplomatic Interception with rows of radio operators listening to the wireless traffic between Germany, Italy, Tokyo and other enemy embassies around the world. Messages intercepted at Sandridge were sent to Bletchley Park for decryption. The results were vital to Winston Churchill who used the information to make important decisions about the course of the war. After the Second World War it became part of the Diplomatic Wireless Service under GCHQ and in 1973 the site was taken over by the Home Office for police research. In 2008 the Woodland Trust announced plans to create a new forest north of Sandridge. The of woodland are to be called Heartwood Forest.

He also gained many celestial weapons.Ganguly The Mahabharata Retrieved 2015-02-15 Time passed and Drupada became the king of Panchala. Drona married Kripi, the sister of Kripa and had a son named Ashwatthama. Drona was not interested in material wealth and became poor. Drona's Insult Once, Drona's son Ashwatthama was playing with his friends. His friends were drinking milk and he wanted to drink it too. But his friends mixed flour with water and gave it to him. This enraged Drona and he remembered Drupada's promised. He went to Drupada's palace and asked him to give cows. But Drupada, filled with pride and ego, refused.

Drona was greatly impressed by Arjuna's concentration, determination, and drive, and promised him that he would become the greatest archer on earth. Drona gave Arjuna special knowledge of the divine Astras. Drona was partial especially to Arjuna and Ashwatthama. Drona dearly loved his son Ashwatthama and as a guru, he loved Arjuna more than anyone. =Ekalavya= A strong criticism against Dronacharya is towards his unkind treatment of Ekalavya. However, it can be argued that Dronacharya was merely abiding by his duty. Ekalavya, the son of a Nishadha chief, approached Dronacharya seeking his instruction. But since his father was a general under Jarasandh, the ruler of Magadha (an enemy state), Dronacharya refused to train him alongside Kauravas and Panadavas. Undeterred, Ekalavya began study and practice by himself, having fashioned a clay idol of Dronacharya's to watch over his training. Solely by his determination, Ekalavya became an archer of exceptional skill. One day, Ekalavya's focus in training was disturbed by the barking of a dog belonging to the Kuru princes. Ekalavya fired arrows that filled up the dog's mouth without spilling blood or causing injury to the dog. The Kuru princes were amazed by the trick and looked for the archer when they saw Ekalavya, who introduced himself as a pupil of Drona's. This enraged Arjuna, who accused Ekalavya of treachery and demanded Drona to punish him for illegitimate study. Drona was in a tangle: on the one hand, he greatly admired Ekalavya's skill and dedication; on the other hand, Ekalavya had indeed been training as his pupil without his consent, albeit being guided only by his idol. To resolve the matter, Drona accepted Ekalavya as his student, but demanded the thumb on his dominant hand as gurudakshina, or teacher's payment, in order to limit his abilities and further growth in archery, thus pacifying Arjuna. Ekalavya, being an exemplary disciple, immediately cut off his thumb and presented it at Drona's feet. Moved by Ekalavya's sacrifice, Drona blessed him to attain mastery even without his thumb. Weapons of Drona Drona held the invincible sword of Lord Brahma. Bhishma once told the story of this sword to Pandava prince Nakula. This sword was the primordial weapon created by the gods for the destruction of evil. The name of the sword was Asi, the personification and the primary energy behind all the weapons ever created. As per Bhishma, the constellation under which the sword was born is called Krittika, Agni is its deity, Rohini is its Gotra, Rudra is its high preceptor and whoever holds this weapon obtains victory for sure. Role in the Kurukshetra War Bhima fights drona Dronacharya had been the preceptor of most kings involved in the Kurukshetra War, on both sides. Dronacharya strongly condemned Duryodhana exiling the Pandavas, as well as the Kauravas' general abuse towards the Pandavas. But being a servant of Hastinapura, Dronacharya was duty-bound to fight for the Kauravas, and thus against his favorite Pandavas. After the fall of Bhishma on the tenth day, he became the Chief Commander of the Kuru army on 11th day of war. Duryodhana manages to convince Drona to try to end the war by capturing Yudhishthira. Though he killed hundreds and thousands of Pandava soldiers, Drona failed to capture Yudhishthira on days eleven and twelve of the war, as Arjuna was always there to repel his advances.The Mahabharata, Book 7: Drona Parva: Abhimanyu-vadha Parva: Section XLVI =Abhimanyu's killing= The Pandavas' nephew Abhimanyu battles the Kauravas and their allies On the 13th day of battle, Dronacharya formed the Chakravyuha strategy to capture Yudhishtira, knowing that only Arjuna and Krishna would know how to penetrate it. The Trigartas were distracting Arjuna and Krishna into another part of the battlefield, allowing the main Kuru army to surge through the Pandava ranks. Unknown to many, Arjuna's young son Abhimanyu had the knowledge to penetrate the formation but did not know the way out. At the request of Yudhishthira, Abhimanyu agreed to lead the way for the Pandava army and was able to penetrate the formation. However, he was trapped when Jayadratha, the king of Sindhu, held the Pandava warriors who were following him, at bay. Abhimanyu did not know how to get out of the Chakravyuha, but embarked upon an all-out attack on the Kuru army, killing tens of thousands of warriors single-handedly. Drona is impressed with Abhimanyu and praises him endlessly, earning the ire of Duryodhana. With his army facing decimation and spurred on by Duryodhana's criticisms, Drona asked the Kaurava warriors to simultaneously attack Abhimanyu, to strike down his horses and his charioteer and to disable his chariot from different angles. Left without support, Abhimanyu began fighting from the ground. Exhausted after his long, prodigious feats, Abhimanyu was eventually killed. After that, several who fought against Abhimanyu were criticized for their murder, such as Bhurishrava, Drona, or Karna. =Fourteenth Day= The devious murder of his son enraged Arjuna, who swore to kill Jayadratha the next day or immolate himself. Drona constructed 3 combined vyuhas to protect Jayadratha, first was the Shakata vyuha then was Padma Vyuha and last was the Srigantaka vyuha and at its rear was Jayadratha and stood at the head of the box formation or shakata vyuha In the early part of the day, Arjuna and he duel, and Arjuna is unable to bypass his preceptor. With Krishna's prodding, Arjuna circumvents Drona. When Duryodhana rages at Drona, Drona replies and that he intends to capture Yudhishthira while Arjuna is away and would only hasten their victory.K M Ganguly(1883-1896). The Mahabharata, Book 7 Drona Parva sacred- texts.com, October 2003, Retrieved 2016-08-29 In a notable battle, Drona attempts to capture Yudhishthira but is stopped by Dhristadyumna. Drona severely wounds his friend's son, disarming him and forcing him to retreat. When he attempts to chase after Dhristadyumna, he is checked by Satyaki, who insults his teacher's teacher and issues a challenge. Their combat is described as fierce and despite being able to hold off Drona for several hours, Satyaki eventually tires and has to be rescued by the Upapandavas. Later in the day, Yudhishthira sends Satyaki to aid Arjuna. When Satyaki comes upon Drona, he circumvents him, saying he must follow in his teacher's footsteps. When Yudhishthira later sends Bhima, Drona recounts what happened with Arjuna and Satyaki, and hence makes sure he does not allow Bhima also to circumvent him. Angrily rebuking him, Bhima shatters Drona's chariot with his mace. Drona takes up another chariot, only for Bhima to smash that one as well. In total, Bhima smashes eight of Drona's chariots and is able to bypass his guru. Death On the 14th night (as the kuravas were not ready to stop) of the Mahabharata war, Drona is instigated by Duryodhana's remarks of being a traitor as he was not able to protect Jaidrath. Sensing his end is near, he used the Brahmastra against the common Pandava soldiers. At that moment, all the Sapta ·πö·π£is appeared on the sky and requested Drona to retract this ultimate weapon used on ordinary soldiers. Dronacharya obeyed, retracting the weapon. The rishis continue and berate Drona for violating the rules of war, criticizing him for using divine weapons so indiscriminately. Drona reiterates that he is sworn to do all he can to protect Hastinapur, and that, moreover, he wants to do so for all that Dhritarashtra has given him. On that day, Drona kills many Pandava soldiers, including Virat in arrow-play and Drupada in a sword fight. Lamenting the deterioration of their friendship, Drona pays his respect to Drupada's corpse. Bhima kills an elephant named Asvatthama, By Artist Sadiq from Razmnama Knowing it would be impossible to defeat an armed Drona, Krishna suggested the Pandavas a plan to disarm their teacher. His idea was that Bhima first kill an elephant named Ashwatthama, and then claim to Dronacharya that he has killed Dronacharya's son with the same name. After killing the elephant, Bhima loudly proclaimed that he had killed \\"Ashwatthama\\". Disbelieving him, Drona approached Yudhishthira, knowing of Yudhishthira's firm adherence to Dharma and honesty. When Dronacharya asked for the truth, Yudhishthira responded with the cryptic \\"Ashwatthama is dead. But the elephant and not your son.\\" Krishna also knew that it would be impossible for Yudhishthira to lie outright. Under his instructions, the other warriors blew trumpets and conchs, raising a tumultuous noise in such a way that Dronacharya only heard that \\"Ashwatthama was dead\\", and could not hear the latter part of Yudhishthira's reply. In other versions of the story, it is told that: Drona, in grief, simply does not process the final part of Yudhishthira's statement, or Yudhishthira was simply not loud enough in purpose when he spoke the latter part of his words.\\"Ashwatthama is dead\\" has become a proverbial phrase for a half-lie or half-truth intended to confuse the opponent or the public. Then Drona descended from his chariot, laid down his arms and sat in meditation. Pandavas wanted to use this opportunity to arrest him, but enraged by the death of his father and several Panchala warriors, Dhrishtadyumna took this opportunity and beheads him, in a gross violation of the rules of war. Krishna justified the act saying Drona's role in killing of Abhimanyu. Analysis and modern assessment Drona's demand of guru dakshina from Ekalavya, in the form of his right thumb, is also scrutinized. In some folklore, Saraswati cursed Dronacharya with an unarmed and humiliating death for Drona's actions. Saraswati said that knowledge belonged to all, and that it was an acharya's duty to spread that knowledge everywhere.K M Ganguly(1883-1896). The Mahabharata, Book 7 Drona Parva sacred- texts.com, October 2003, Retrieved 2016-08-29 Despite whatever reasons he gave, Drona cheated Ekalavya and Karna to achieve something for himself-to protect his promise to Arjuna that he would make Arjuna the world's greatest archer, as well as his oath to Hastinapur. Drona was somewhat parallel to Bhishma both in martial powers, and, compelled by the refuge they had given him, in his unwavering commitment to fighting for Hastinapur irrespective of who the ruler was and whether or not the cause was just. Like Bhishma, Drona is criticized for his pride and conceit, siding with adharma despite knowing of and acknowledging the righteousness of the Pandava cause. Krishna criticized this reasoning as mere pride-Drona wanted to put his obligation to Hastinapur over dharma so that no one questioned his honor.Brodbeck, Simon. The MahƒÅbhƒÅrata Patriline: Gender, Culture, and the Royal Hereditary. Farnham, England: Ashgate, 2009. Print. Dronacharya was criticized for many of his actions during the war: * First, as a Brahmin, and secondly, as the princes' teacher, he should have removed himself from the battlefield. * Dronacharya tried to use Brahmastra , celestial powerful weapons against the Pandavas' common foot-soldiers. But when Lord Krishna stopped him, Drona argued that his first obligation was to defeating his enemy and defending his soldiers, by whatever means he possessed. * His responsibility for the devious and brutal murder of Abhimanyu, as he was the Kaurava army chief at the time. * Symbol of casteism: As Drona asked Ekalavya to cut off his right thumb as Guru Dakshina (fee for teacher). Ekalavya cut off his thumb and presented it as Gurudakshina to Dronacharya. In reality, he was not a teacher of Eklavya, still he asked right thumb from an archer. Droncharya's overarching actions during the war are portrayed differently. When he became commander-in-chief, the rules of war were averted. Divine weapons were used against ordinary soldiers, war continued throughout the night, warriors no longer engaged each other one-on- one, etc. Specifically, he was willing to try to end the war by capturing Yudhishthira, while Karna was not, as he considered it lacking honor. He is compared directly to Karna, who, not even knowing that he was a kshatriya, still intuitively understood the kshatriya code/way-of-life. In other versions, Drona's differences in strategy are shown as a difference in philosophy- Drona believed, that as the commander-in-chief of the Kaurava army, his goal was to ensure the protection of his soldiers through any means necessary. By choosing to uphold the rules of war and the concept of honorable acts over his soldiers' lives, he would be doing them a disservice. He remains a revered figure in Hindu history, and a pillar of the Indian tradition of respecting one's teacher as an equal not only of parents, but even of God. The Government of India annually awards the Dronacharya Award for excellence in sports tutelage to the best sports teachers and coaches in India.Dronacharya Award It is believed that the city of Gurgaon (literally - \\"Village of the Guru\\") was founded as \\"Guru Gram\\" by Dronacharya on land given to him by Dhritarashtra, the king of Hastinapura in recognition of his teachings of martial arts to the princes, and the 'Dronacharya Tank', still exists within the Gurgaon city, along with a village called Gurgaon.Gurgaon History Indian Government (Haryana), on 12 April 2016 decided to reinstate and change the name of Gurgaon to Gurugram.

In addition to these biblical texts, there are extra- biblical texts that Christians believe make reference to certain events in the life of Jesus, such as Josephus on Jesus and Tacitus on Christ. In the gospels, the ministry of Jesus starts with his Baptism by John the Baptist. Jesus came to the Jordan River where he was baptized by John the Baptist, after which he fasted for forty days and nights in the Judaean Desert. This early period also includes the first miracle of Jesus in the Marriage at Cana. The principle locations for the ministry of Jesus were Galilee and Judea, with some activities also taking place in nearby areas such as Perea and Samaria. Jesus' activities in Galilee include a number of miracles and teachings.  Genealogy and Nativity The Adoration of the Shepherds by Gerard van Honthorst, 1622 The genealogy and Nativity of Jesus are described in two of the four canonical gospels: the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke. While Luke traces the genealogy upwards towards Adam and God, Matthew traces it downwards towards Jesus.Where Christology began: essays on Philippians 2 by Ralph P. Martin, Brian J.

The Luke and Matthew accounts of the birth of Jesus have a number of points in common; both have Jesus being born in Bethlehem, in Judea, to a virgin mother. In the Luke account Joseph and Mary travel from their home in Nazareth for the census to Bethlehem, where Jesus is born and laid in a manger.\\"biblical literature.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. 2011. . Angels proclaim him a savior for all people, and shepherds come to adore him; the family then returns to Nazareth. In Matthew, The Magi follow a star to Bethlehem, where the family are living, to bring gifts to Jesus, born the King of the Jews. King Herod massacres all males under two years old in Bethlehem in order to kill Jesus, but Jesus's family flees to Egypt and later settles in Nazareth.

Three days after his burial, he is resurrected and appears to his disciples and a multitude of his followers (numbering around 500 in total) over a 40-day period , after which he ascends to Heaven. =Locations of Ministry= Galilee, Perea and Judea at the time of Jesus In the New Testament accounts, the principle locations for the ministry of Jesus were Galilee and Judea, with activities also taking place in surrounding areas such as Perea and Samaria. The gospel narrative of the ministry of Jesus is traditionally separated into sections that have a geographical nature. :* Galilean ministry: Jesus' ministry begins when after his baptism, he returns to Galilee, and preaches in the synagogue of Capernaum.Jesus in the Synagogue of Capernaum: The Pericope and its Programmatic Character for the Gospel of Mark by John Chijioke Iwe 1991 p. 7 The first disciples of Jesus encounter him near the Sea of Galilee and his later Galilean ministry includes key episodes such as Sermon on the Mount (with the Beatitudes) which form the core of his moral teachings.The Sermon on the mount: a theological investigation by Carl G. Vaught 2001 pages xi‚ÄìxivThe Synoptics: Matthew, Mark, Luke by J√°n Majern√≠k, Joseph Ponessa, Laurie Watson Manhardt, 2005, , pages 63‚Äì68 Jesus' ministry in the Galilee area draws to an end with the death of John the Baptist. :* Journey to Jerusalem: After the death of the Baptist, about half way through the gospels (approximately Matthew 17 and Mark 9) two key events take place that change the nature of the narrative by beginning the gradual revelation of his identity to his disciples: his proclamation as Christ by Peter and his transfiguration. After these events, a good portion of the gospel narratives deal with Jesus' final journey to Jerusalem through Perea and Judea. As Jesus travels towards Jerusalem through Perea he returns to the area where he was baptized. :* Final week in Jerusalem: The final part of Jesus' ministry begins (Matthew 21 and Mark 11) with his triumphal entry into Jerusalem after the raising of Lazarus episode which takes place in Bethany. The gospels provide more details about the final portion than the other periods, devoting about one third of their text to the last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem which ends in his crucifixion. The New Testament accounts of the resurrection appearances of Jesus and his ascension are also in Judea. = Baptism and temptation= Francesco Albani's 17th-century Baptism of Christ is a typical depiction with the sky opening and the Holy Spirit descending as a dove as Jesus was baptized by John.Medieval art: a topical dictionary by Leslie Ross 1996 p. 30 The Baptism of Jesus marks the beginning of his public ministry. This event is recorded in the Canonical Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke. In John 1:29‚Äì33, rather than a direct narrative, John the Baptist bears witness to the episode.Jesus of history, Christ of faith by Thomas Zanzig 2000 page 118The Gospel and Epistles of John: A Concise Commentary by Raymond Edward Brown 1988 pages 25‚Äì27 In the New Testament, John the Baptist preached a \\"baptism with water\\", not of forgiveness but of penance or repentance for the remission of sins (), and declared himself a forerunner to one who would baptize 'with the Holy Spirit and with fire' (). In so doing he was preparing the way for Jesus.Harrington, Daniel J., SJ. \\"Jesus Goes Public.\\" America, Jan. 7‚Äì14, 2008, pp. 38ff Jesus came to the Jordan River where he was baptized by John.; Hebrews 4:15; Pope Benedict XVI. Jesus of Nazareth. Doubleday Religion, 2007. The baptismal scene includes the Heavens opening, a dove-like descent of the Holy Spirit, and a voice from Heaven saying, \\"This is my beloved Son with whom I am well pleased.\\" Most modern scholars view the fact that Jesus was baptized by John as an historical event to which a high degree of certainty can be assigned.The Gospel of Matthew by Daniel J. Harrington 1991 p. 63Christianity: A Biblical, Historical, and Theological Guide by Glenn Jonas, Kathryn Muller Lopez 2010 ISBN pages 95-96Studying the historical Jesus: evaluations of the state of current research by Bruce Chilton, Craig A. Evans 1998 page 187-198Jesus as a figure in history: how modern historians view the man from Galilee by Mark Allan Powell 1998 p. 47 James Dunn states that the historicity of the Baptism and crucifixion of Jesus \\"command almost universal assent\\".Jesus Remembered by James D. G. Dunn 2003 p. 339 Along with the crucifixion of Jesus most scholars view it as one of the two historically certain facts about him, and often use it as the starting points for the study of the historical Jesus. The temptation of Jesus is detailed in the gospels of Matthew,, New International Version Mark,, NIV and Luke., NIV In these narratives, after being baptized, Jesus fasted for forty days and nights in the Judaean Desert. During this time, the devil appeared to Jesus and tempted him. Jesus having refused each temptation, the devil departed and angels came and brought nourishment to Jesus. =Calling the disciples and early Ministry= Calling of the disciples and the miraculous catch of fish, by Raphael, 1515 The calling of the first disciples is a key episode in the gospels which begins the active ministry of Jesus, and builds the foundation for the group of people who follow him, and later form the early Church.The Gospel according to Matthew by Leon Morris 1992 p. 83Luke by Fred B. Craddock 1991 p. 69 It takes place in , and on the Sea of Galilee. reports the first encounter with two of the disciples a little earlier in the presence of John the Baptist. Particularly in the Gospel of Mark the beginning of the ministry of Jesus and the call of the first disciples are inseparable.The beginning of the Gospel: introducing the Gospel according to Mark by Eugene LaVerdiere 1999 p. 49 In the Gospel of Luke (), the event is part of the first miraculous catch of fish and results in Peter as well as James and John, the sons of Zebedee, joining Jesus vocationally as disciples.John Clowes, The Miracles of Jesus Christ published by J.

Green 1997 p. 230 The gathering of the disciples in follows the many patterns of discipleship that continue in the New Testament, in that who have received someone else's witness become witnesses to Jesus themselves. Andrew follows Jesus because of the testimony of John the Baptist, Philip brings Nathanael and the pattern continues in where the Samaritan Woman at the Well testifies to the town people about Jesus.John by Gail R. O'Day, Susan Hylen 2006 p. 31 This early period also includes the first miracle of Jesus in the Marriage at Cana, in the Gospel of John where Jesus and his disciples are invited to a wedding and when the wine runs out Jesus turns water into wine by performing a miracle.H.

Separately in Luke 10:1‚Äì24 relates the Seventy Disciples, where Jesus appoints a larger number of disciples and sent them out in pairs with the Missionary's Mandate to go into villages before Jesus' arrival there.Luke by Sharon H. Ringe 1995 pages 151‚Äì152 Walking on water, by Veneziano, 1370 After hearing of the Baptist's death, Jesus withdraws by boat privately to a solitary place near Bethsaida, where he addresses the crowds who had followed him on foot from the towns, and feeds them all by \\"five loaves and two fish\\" supplied by a boy.Robert Maguire 1863 The miracles of Christ published by Weeks and Co. London p. 185 Following this, the gospels present the Walking on water episode in Matthew 14:22‚Äì23, Mark 6:45‚Äì52 and John 6:16‚Äì21 as an important step in developing the relationship between Jesus and his disciples, at this stage of his ministry.Merrill Chapin Tenney 1997 John: Gospel of Belief p. 114 The episode emphasizes the importance of faith by stating that when he attempted to walk on water, Peter began to sink when he lost faith and became afraid, and at the end of the episode, the disciples increase their faith in Jesus and in Matthew 14:33 they say: \\"Of a truth thou art the Son of God\\".Dwight Pentecost 2000 The words and works of Jesus Christ p. 234 Major teachings in this period include the Discourse on Defilement in Matthew 15:1‚Äì20 and Mark 7:1‚Äì23 where in response to a complaint from the Pharisees Jesus states: \\"What goes into a man's mouth does not make him 'unclean,' but what comes out of his mouth, that is what makes him 'unclean.'\\".Jesus the miracle worker: a historical & theological study by Graham H. Twelftree 1999 p. 79 Following this episode Jesus withdraws into the \\"parts of Tyre and Sidon\\" near the Mediterranean Sea where the Canaanite woman's daughter episode takes place in Matthew 15:21‚Äì28 and Mark 7:24‚Äì30.Jesus the miracle worker: a historical & theological study by Graham H. Twelftree 1999 pages 133‚Äì134 This episode is an example of how Jesus emphasizes the value of faith, telling the woman: \\"Woman, you have great faith! Your request is granted.\\" The importance of faith is also emphasized in the Cleansing ten lepers episode in Luke 17:11‚Äì19.Berard L. Marthaler 2007 The creed: the apostolic faith in contemporary theology page 220Lockyer, Herbert, 1988 All the Miracles of the Bible page 235 In the Gospel of Mark, after passing through Sidon Jesus enters the region of the Decapolis, a group of ten cities south east of Galilee, where the Healing the deaf mute miracle is reported in Mark 7:31‚Äì37, where after the healing, the disciples say: \\"He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.\\" The episode is the last in a series of narrated miracles which builds up to Peter's proclamation of Jesus as Christ in Mark 8:29.Lamar Williamson 1983 Mark pages 138‚Äì140 =Proclamation as Christ= Pietro Perugino's depiction of the \\"Giving of the Keys to Saint Peter\\" by Jesus, 1481-82 The Confession of Peter refers to an episode in the New Testament in which in Jesus asks a question to his disciples: \\"Who do you say that I am?\\" Apostle Peter proclaims Jesus to be Christ ‚Äì the expected Messiah. The proclamation is described in the three Synoptic Gospels: Matthew 16:13‚Äì20, Mark 8:27‚Äì30 and Luke 9:18‚Äì20.The Collegeville Bible Commentary: New Testament by Robert J. Karris 1992 pages 885‚Äì886Who do you say that I am? Essays on Christology by Jack Dean Kingsbury, Mark Allan Powell, David R. Bauer 1999 page xvi Peter's Confession begins as a dialogue between Jesus and his disciples in which Jesus begins to ask about the current opinions about himself among \\"the multitudes\\", asking: \\"Who do the multitudes say that I am?\\" The disciples provide a variety of the common hypotheses at the time. Jesus then asks his disciples about their own opinion: But who do you say that I am? Only Simon Peter answers him: You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.Christology and the New Testament by Christopher Mark Tuckett 2001 page 109 In Matthew 16:17 Jesus blesses Peter for his answer, and later indicates him as the rock of the Church, and states that he will give Peter \\"the keys of the kingdom of heaven\\".The people's New Testament commentary by M. Eugene Boring, Fred B. Craddock 2004 page 69 In blessing Peter, Jesus not only accepts the titles Christ and Son of God which Peter attributes to him, but declares the proclamation a divine revelation by stating that his Father in Heaven had revealed it to Peter.One teacher: Jesus' teaching role in Matthew's gospel by John Yueh-Han Yieh 2004 pages 240‚Äì241 In this assertion, by endorsing both titles as divine revelation, Jesus unequivocally declares himself to be both Christ and the Son of God. The proclamation of Jesus as Christ is fundamental to Christology and the Confession of Peter, and Jesus' acceptance of the title is a definitive statement for it in the New Testament narrative.The Gospel of Matthew by Rudolf Schnackenburg 2002 pages 7‚Äì9 While some of this passage may well be authentic, the reference to Jesus as Christ and Son of God is likely to be an addition by Matthew. =Transfiguration= The Transfiguration of Jesus, depicted by Carl Bloch, 19th century The Transfiguration of Jesus is an episode in the New Testament narrative in which Jesus is transfigured (or metamorphosed) and becomes radiant upon a mountain. The Synoptic Gospels (Matthew 17:1‚Äì9, Mark 9:2‚Äì8, Luke 9:28‚Äì36) describe it, and 2 Peter 1:16‚Äì18 refers to it. In these accounts, Jesus and three of his apostles go to a mountain (the Mount of Transfiguration). On the mountain, Jesus begins to shine with bright rays of light. Then the prophets Moses and Elijah appear next to him and he speaks with them. Jesus is then called \\"Son\\" by a voice in the sky, assumed to be God the Father, as in the Baptism of Jesus.Transfiguration by Dorothy A. Lee 2005 pages 21‚Äì30 The Transfiguration is one of the miracles of Jesus in the Gospels.Lockyer, Herbert, 1988 All the Miracles of the Bible page 213Clowes, John, 1817, The Miracles of Jesus Christ published by J. Gleave, Manchester, UK page 167Henry Rutter, Evangelical harmony Keating and Brown, London 1803. page 450 This miracle is unique among others that appear in the Canonical gospels, in that the miracle happens to Jesus himself.Karl Barth Church dogmatics page 478 Thomas Aquinas considered the Transfiguration \\"the greatest miracle\\" in that it complemented baptism and showed the perfection of life in Heaven.Nicholas M. Healy, 2003 Thomas Aquinas: theologian of the Christian life page 100 The Transfiguration is one of the five major milestones in the gospel narrative of the life of Jesus, the others being Baptism, Crucifixion, Resurrection, and Ascension. In the New Testament, Transfiguration is a pivotal moment, and the setting on the mountain is presented as the point where human nature meets God: the meeting place for the temporal and the eternal, with Jesus himself as the connecting point, acting as the bridge between heaven and earth.Transfiguration by Dorothy A. Lee 2005 page 2 =Final journey to Jerusalem= Sixth-century mosaic of the Raising of Lazarus, church of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo, Ravenna, Italy. After the death of John the Baptist and the Transfiguration, Jesus starts his final journey to Jerusalem, having predicted his own death there.The temptations of Jesus in Mark's Gospel by Susan R. Garrett 1996 pages 74‚Äì75Matthew for Everyone by Tom Wright 2004 page 9 The Gospel of John states that during the final journey Jesus returned to the area where he was baptized, and John 10:40‚Äì42 states that \\"many people believed in him beyond the Jordan\\", saying \\"all things whatsoever John spake of this man were true\\". The area where Jesus was baptised is inferred as the vicinity of the Perea area, given the activities of the Baptist in Bethabara and √Ünon in John 1:28 and 3:23.Big Picture of the Bible ‚Äì New Testament by Lorna Daniels Nichols 2009 page 12John by Gerard Stephen Sloyan 1987 page 11 Scholars generally assume that the route Jesus followed from Galilee to Jerusalem passed through Perea. This period of ministry includes the Discourse on the Church in which Jesus anticipates a future community of followers, and explains the role of his apostles in leading it.Preaching Matthew's Gospel by Richard A. Jensen 1998 pages 25 & 158Behold the King: A Study of Matthew by Stanley D. Toussaint 2005 pages 215‚Äì216 It includes the parables of The Lost Sheep and The Unforgiving Servant in Matthew 18 which also refer to the Kingdom of Heaven. The general theme of the discourse is the anticipation of a future community of followers, and the role of his apostles in leading it. Addressing his apostles in 18:18, Jesus states: \\"what things soever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and what things soever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven\\". The discourse emphasizes the importance of humility and self-sacrifice as the high virtues within the anticipated community. It teaches that in the Kingdom of God, it is childlike humility that matters, not social prominence and clout.Matthew by Larry Chouinard 1997 page 321 At the end of this period, the Gospel of John includes the Raising of Lazarus episode in John 11:1‚Äì46 in which Jesus brings Lazarus of Bethany back to life four days after his burial. In the Gospel of John, the raising of Lazarus is the climax of the \\"seven signs\\" which gradually confirm the identity of Jesus as the Son of God and the expected Messiah.The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament by Andreas J. K√∂stenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 pages 312‚Äì313 It is also a pivotal episode which starts the chain of events that leads to the crowds seeking Jesus on his Triumphal entry into Jerusalem ‚Äì leading to the decision of Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin to plan to kill Jesus.Francis J. Moloney, Daniel J. Harrington, 1998 The Gospel of John Liturgical Press page 325 = Final week in Jerusalem = The Last Supper has been depicted by many artistic masters.Gospel figures in art by Stefano Zuffi 2003 pages 254‚Äì259 This Last Supper is by Pascal Dagnan-Bouveret (1896)The description of the last week of the life of Jesus (often called the Passion week) occupies about one third of the narrative in the canonical gospels. The narrative for that week starts by a description of the final entry into Jerusalem, and ends with his crucifixion.Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey by Craig L. Blomberg 2009 page 224-229 The last week in Jerusalem is the conclusion of the journey which Jesus had started in Galilee through Perea and Judea. Just before the account of the final entry of Jesus into Jerusalem, the Gospel of John includes the Raising of Lazarus episode, which builds the tension between Jesus and the authorities. At the beginning of the week as Jesus enters Jerusalem, he is greeted by the cheering crowds, adding to that tension. The week begins with the Triumphal entry into Jerusalem. During the week of his \\"final ministry in Jerusalem\\", Jesus visits the Temple, and has a conflict with the money changers about their use of the Temple for commercial purposes. This is followed by a debate with the priests and the elder in which his authority is questioned. One of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, decides to betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver.All the Apostles of the Bible by Herbert Lockyer 1988 page 106-111 Towards the end of the week, Jesus has the Last Supper with his disciples, during which he institutes the Eucharist, and prepares them for his departure in the Farewell Discourse. After the supper, Jesus is betrayed with a kiss while he is in agony in the garden, and is arrested. After his arrest, Jesus is abandoned by most of his disciples, and Peter denies him three times, as Jesus had predicted during the Last Supper.Cox (2007) p. 182Craig A. Evans 2005 The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: John's Gospel, Hebrews-Revelation page 122 The final week that begins with his entry into Jerusalem, concludes with his crucifixion and burial on that Friday. Passion =Betrayal and arrest= Kiss of Judas (1304‚Äì1306), fresco by Giotto, Scrovegni Chapel, Padua, Italy In Matthew 26:36‚Äì46, Mark 14:32‚Äì42, Luke 22:39‚Äì46 and John 18:1, immediately after the Last Supper, Jesus takes a walk to pray, Matthew and Mark identifying this place of prayer as Garden of Gethsemane.The Synoptics: Matthew, Mark, Luke by J√°n Majern√≠k, Joseph Ponessa, Laurie Watson Manhardt 2005 page 169The Bible Knowledge Commentary: New Testament edited by John F. Walvoord, Roy B. Zuck 1983 pages 83‚Äì85 Jesus is accompanied by Peter, John and James the Greater, whom he asks to \\"remain here and keep watch with me.\\" He moves \\"a stone's throw away\\" from them, where he feels overwhelming sadness and says \\"My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass me by. Nevertheless, let it be as you, not I, would have it.\\" Only the Gospel of Luke mentions the details of the sweat of blood of Jesus and the visitation of the angel who comforts Jesus as he accepts the will of the Father. Returning to the disciples after prayer, he finds them asleep and in Matthew 26:40 he asks Peter: \\"So, could you men not keep watch with me for an hour?\\" While in the Garden, Judas appears, accompanied by a crowd that includes the Jewish priests and elders and people with weapons. Judas gives Jesus a kiss to identify him to the crowd who then arrests Jesus. One of Jesus' disciples tries to stop them and uses a sword to cut off the ear of one of the men in the crowd. Luke states that Jesus miraculously healed the wound and John and Matthew state that Jesus criticized the violent act, insisting that his disciples should not resist his arrest. In Matthew 26:52 Jesus makes the well known statement: all who live by the sword, shall die by the sword. =Justice= Jesus about to be struck in front of the High Priest Annas, as in John 18:22, depicted by Madrazo, 1803. In the narrative of the four canonical gospels after the betrayal and arrest of Jesus, he is taken to the Sanhedrin, a Jewish judicial body.Brown, Raymond E. An Introduction to the New Testament Doubleday 1997 , p. 146. Jesus is tried by the Sanhedrin, mocked and beaten and is condemned for making claims of being the Son of God.The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: Matthew-Luke, Volume 1 by Craig A. Evans 2003 page 487-500Jesus and the Gospels: An Introduction and Survey by Craig L. Blomberg 2009 pages 396‚Äì400Holman Concise Bible Dictionary 2011 pages 608‚Äì609 He is then taken to Pontius Pilate and the Jewish elders ask Pilate to judge and condemn Jesus‚Äîaccusing him of claiming to be the King of the Jews. After questioning, with few replies provided by Jesus, Pilate publicly declares that he finds Jesus innocent, but the crowd insists on punishment. Pilate then orders Jesus' crucifixion.The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1982 pages 1050‚Äì1052 Although the Gospel accounts vary with respect to various details, they agree on the general character and overall structure of the trials of Jesus. After the Sanhedrin trial Jesus is taken to Pilate's court in the praetorium. Only in the Gospel of Luke, finding that Jesus, being from Galilee, belonged to Herod Antipas' jurisdiction, Pilate decides to send Jesus to Herod. Herod Antipas (the same man who had previously ordered the death of John the Baptist) had wanted to see Jesus for a long time, because he had been hoping to observe one of the miracles of Jesus.Pontius Pilate: portraits of a Roman governor by Warren Carter 2003 pages 120‚Äì121 However, Jesus says almost nothing in response to Herod's questions, or the vehement accusations of the chief priests and the scribes. Herod and his soldiers mock Jesus, put a gorgeous robe on him, as the King of the Jews, and sent him back to Pilate. And Herod and Pilate become friends with each other that day: for before they were at enmity.New Testament History by Richard L. Niswonger 1992 page 172 After questioning Jesus and receiving very few replies, Herod sees Jesus as no threat and returns him to Pilate.Bromiley, Geoffrey W. (1995), International Standard Bible Encyclopedia. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. vol. K-P. p. 929. After Jesus' return from Herod's court, Pilate publicly declares that he finds Jesus to be innocent of the charges, but the crowd insists on capital punishment. The universal rule of the Roman Empire limited capital punishment strictly to the tribunal of the Roman governorInternational Standard Bible Encyclopedia. by Geoffrey W. Bromiley 1982 vol. K-P, p. 979. and Pilate decided to publicly wash his hands as not being privy to Jesus' death. Pilate thus presents himself as an advocate pleading Jesus' case rather than as a judge in an official hearing, yet he orders the crucifixion of Jesus.Matthew (New Cambridge Bible Commentary) by Craig A. Evans (Feb 6, 2012) page 454The Historical Jesus Through Catholic and Jewish Eyes by Bryan F. Le Beau, Leonard J.

J. D. Crossan, page 145 states: \\"that he was crucified is as sure as anything historical can ever be.\\"The Word in this world by Paul William Meyer, John T. Carroll 2004 page 112 After the trials, Jesus made his way to Calvary (the path is traditionally called via Dolorosa) and the three synoptic gospels indicate that he was assisted by Simon of Cyrene, the Romans compelling him to do so.The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: Matthew-Luke, Volume 1 by Craig A. Evans 2003 page 509-520 In Luke 23:27‚Äì28 Jesus tells the women in multitude of people following him not to cry for him but for themselves and their children. Once at Calvary (Golgotha), Jesus was offered wine mixed with gall to drink ‚Äî usually offered as a form of painkiller. Matthew's and Mark's gospels state that he refused this. The soldiers then crucified Jesus and cast lots for his clothes. Above Jesus' head on the cross was the inscription King of the Jews, and the soldiers and those passing by mocked him about the title. Jesus was crucified between two convicted thieves, one of whom rebuked Jesus, while the other defended him.Merriam-Webster's encyclopedia of world religions by Merriam-Webster, Inc. 1999 page 271 Each gospel has its own account of Jesus' last words, comprising the seven last sayings on the cross.Geoffrey W.

Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard 1998 page 648Reading Luke-Acts: dynamics of Biblical narrative by William S.

K√∂stenberger, L. Scott Kellum 2009 pages 211‚Äì214 The tearing of the temple veil, upon the death of Jesus, is referenced in the synoptic. The Roman soldiers did not break Jesus' legs, as they did to the other two men crucified (breaking the legs hastened the crucifixion process), as Jesus was dead already; this further fulfilled prophecy, as noted in John 19:36, \\"For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.\\" One of the soldiers pierced the side of Jesus with a lance and blood and water flowed out. In Mark 15:39, impressed by the events the Roman centurion calls Jesus the Son of God.The Gospel according to Mark by George Martin 2o05 page 440Mark by Allen Black 1995 page 280 Following Jesus' death on Friday, Joseph of Arimathea asked the permission of Pilate to remove the body. The body was removed from the cross, was wrapped in a clean cloth and buried in a new rock-hewn tomb, with the assistance of Nicodemus. In Matthew 27:62‚Äì66 the Jews go to Pilate the day after the crucifixion and ask for guards for the tomb and also seal the tomb with a stone as well as the guard, to be sure the body remains there.The Gospel of Matthew by Daniel J. Harrington 1991 page 404The Gospel according to Matthew by Leon Morris page 727  Resurrection and Ascension Lucas Cranach, 1558 The gospels state that the first day of the week after the crucifixion (typically interpreted as a Sunday), the followers of Jesus encounter him risen from the dead, after his tomb was discovered to be empty.The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: Matthew-Luke, Volume 1 by Craig A. Evans 2003 pages 521‚Äì530The Bible Knowledge Commentary: New Testament edited by John F. Walvoord, Roy B. Zuck 1983 page 91Matthew 28:1, Mark 16:9, Luke 24:1 and John 20:1Cox (2007) pp. 216‚Äì226 The New Testament does not include an account of the \\"moment of resurrection\\" and in the Eastern Church icons do not depict that moment, but show the Myrrhbearers, and depict scenes of salvation.Stagg, Evalyn and Frank. Woman in the World of Jesus. Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1978, p. 144‚Äì150.Vladimir Lossky, 1982 The Meaning of Icons page 185 The resurrected Jesus then appears to his followers that day and a number of times thereafter, delivers sermons and has supper with some of them, before ascending to Heaven. The gospels of Luke and Mark include brief mentions of the Ascension, but the main references to it are elsewhere in the New Testament. The four gospels have variations in their account of the resurrection of Jesus and his appearances, but there are four points at which all gospels converge:, , , and the turning of the stone that had closed the tomb, the visit of the women on \\"the first day of the week;\\" that the risen Jesus chose first to appear to women (or a woman) and told them (her) to inform the other disciples; the prominence of Mary Magdalene in the accounts.Setzer, Claudia. \\"Excellent Women: Female Witness to the Resurrection.\\" Journal of Biblical Literature, Vol. 116, No. 2 (Summer, 1997), pp. 259‚Äì272 Variants have to do with the precise time the women visited the tomb, the number and identity of the women; the purpose of their visit; the appearance of the messenger(s)‚Äîangelic or human; their message to the women; and the response of the women. In Matthew 28:5, Mark 16:5, Luke 24:4 and John 20:12 his resurrection is announced and explained to the followers who arrive there early in the morning by either one or two beings (either men or angels) dressed in bright robes who appear in or near the tomb. The gospel accounts vary as to who arrived at the tomb first, but they are women and are instructed by the risen Jesus to inform the other disciples. All four accounts include Mary Magdalene and three include Mary the mother of Jesus. The accounts of Mark 16:9, John 20:15 indicate that Jesus appeared to the Magdalene first, and Luke 16:9 states that she was among the Myrrhbearers who informed the disciples about the resurrection. In Matthew 28:11‚Äì15, to explain the empty tomb, the Jewish elders bribe the soldiers who had guarded the tomb to spread the rumor that Jesus' disciples took his body. =Resurrection appearances= Noli me Tangere by Antonio da Correggio, c. 1534 In Jesus appears to Mary Magdalene soon after his resurrection. At first she does not recognize him and thinks that he is the gardener. When he says her name, she recognizes him yet he tells her Noli me Tangere, do not touch me, \\"for I am not yet ascended to my Father.\\" Later that day, at evening, Jesus appears to the disciples and shows them the wounds in his hands and his side in . Thomas the Apostle is not present at that meeting and later expresses doubt about the resurrection of Jesus. As Thomas is expressing his doubts, in the well known Doubting Thomas episode in John 20:24‚Äì29 Jesus appears to him and invites him to put his finger into the holes made by the wounds in Jesus' hands and side. Thomas then professes his faith in Jesus. In , in the Great Commission Jesus appears to his followers on a mountain in Galilee and calls on them to baptize all nations in the name of the \\"Father, Son, and Holy Spirit\\". describes the Road to Emmaus appearance in which while a disciple named Cleopas was walking towards Emmaus with another disciple, they met Jesus, who later has supper with them. has a similar account that describes the appearance of Jesus to two disciples while they were walking in the country, at about the same time in the Gospel narrative.Catholic Comparative New Testament by Oxford University Press 2006 page 589 In the Miraculous catch of 153 fish Jesus appears to his disciples on the Sea of Galilee, and thereafter Jesus encourages Apostle Peter to serve his followers. =Ascension= Garofalo 1520 The Ascension of Jesus (anglicized from the Vulgate Latin Acts 1:9-11 section title: Ascensio Iesu) is the Christian teaching found in the New Testament that the resurrected Jesus was taken up to heaven in his resurrected body, in the presence of eleven of his apostles, occurring 40 days after the resurrection. In the biblical narrative, an angel tells the watching disciples that Jesus' second coming will take place in the same manner as his ascension.\\"Ascension, The.\\" Macmillan Dictionary of the Bible. London: Collins, 2002. Credo Reference. Web. 27 September 2010. The canonical gospels include two brief descriptions of the Ascension of Jesus in Luke 24:50‚Äì53 and Mark 16:19, in which it takes place on Easter Sunday.Fred B. Craddock, Luke (Westminster John Knox Press, 2009), page 293 A more detailed account of Jesus' bodily Ascension into the clouds is given in the Acts of the Apostles (1:9‚Äì11) where the narrative starts with the account of Jesus' appearances after his resurrection and describes the event as taking place forty days later.Luke by Fred B. Craddock 2009 pages 293‚Äì294New Testament Theology by Frank J. Matera 2007 pages 53‚Äì54 Acts 1:9‚Äì12 specifies the location of the Ascension as the \\"mount called Olivet\\" near Jerusalem. Acts 1:3 states that Jesus: :\\"showed himself alive after his passion by many proofs, appearing unto them by the space of forty days, and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God\\". After giving a number of instructions to the apostles Acts 1:9 describes the Ascension as follows:\\"And when he had said these things, as they were looking, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.\\" Following this two men clothed in white appear and tell the apostles that Jesus will return in the same manner as he was taken, and the apostles return to Jerusalem. In Acts 2:30‚Äì33, Ephesians 4:8‚Äì10 and 1 Timothy 3:16 (where Jesus as taken up in glory) the Ascension is spoken of as an accepted fact, while Hebrews 10:12 describes Jesus as seated in heaven.Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible by D.

Early career Apprenticed in the Newton Abbot works of the South Devon Railway, he completed his apprenticeship under Joseph Armstrong in the GWR's Swindon Works. There he rose from draughtsman through several positions, including Carriage Works Manager, and in 1897 was appointed Chief Assistant to William Dean. After 5 years as Chief Assistant, during most of which time Dean was ill and delegating much of his design work to Churchward, in 1902 he formally succeeded Dean as Locomotive Superintendent.Herring, p.21 (except apprenticeships) In 1900 he became the first mayor of Swindon. Chief Mechanical Engineer In the 19th and early 20th century, railway companies were fiercely competitive. Speed meant revenue and speed was dependent on engineering. Churchward delivered to the GWR from Swindon a series of class- leading and innovative locomotives. Arguably, from the early 1900s to the 1920s the Great Western's 2-cylinder and 4-cylinder 4-6-0 designs were substantially superior to any class of locomotive of the other British railway companies. On one occasion, the GWR's directors confronted Churchward, and demanded to know why the London and North Western Railway were able to build three 4-6-0 locomotives for the price of two of Churchward's \\"Stars\\". Churchward allegedly gave a terse response: \\"Because one of mine could pull two of their bloody things backwards!\\"Tuplin (1971) p.74 The biggest engineering challenge of the GWR's operations was travelling over the South Devon Banks, a series of steep inclines linking Exeter and Plymouth in Devon, on the GWR's most important route. Although speed was a key competitive driver across the whole GWR route, the South Devon Banks rewarded sure-footed locomotive designs with good adhesion. The largest opportunity to any GWR CME was the resulting large loading gauge legacy of the GWR's conversion from Brunel's broad gauge track to standard gauge, allowing for wider and higher designs than any of the other later Big Four railway companies. =Philosophy= Churchward's design philosophy followed a number of streams of development, for which he thoroughly researched both competitor UK designs, as well as European and North American locomotives. Following principles based on Belgian inventor Alfred Belpaire, Churchward preferred free steaming boilers. This resulted in his use of a Belpaire-style rectangular firebox, which due to its greater surface area for evaporation was less prone to foaming and carry over of water to the cylinders. Churchward inherited from Dean a series of parallel cylindrical boilers, but by applying mathematical principles to the flow of boiler water, quickly improved the flow of steam by adopting tapered boilers, which give their largest area to the point of highest steam production. Churchward then dispensed with the need for a large dome to collect steam, using instead top-feed of water supply from injectors, which together with top-fitted clack boxes hidden within a brass \\"bonnet\\" minimised boiler stress. Churchward experimented with compounding, a principle development for marine engines which was widely adopted in European locomotive design. Although through his experimentation Churchward found little difference in operation the total power developed in compounding locomotives, the use of European locomotives in his trial led to his adoption of higher pressure boilers, and drive power split between two axles on four cylinder designs. His third stream of philosophy was based around piston valves. Churchward's valves were 50% larger than anything seen in the UK to that time, travelled 50% further, and were designed to be concealed. The result gave the minimum loss of pressure as steam passes to the cylinders. Churchward's resulting locomotive designs excluded trailing wheels, which maximised adhesion on the South Devon Banks. He was an early adopter in UK locomotive design of superheating, made efficient through the GWR's exclusive use of the high calorific-value steam coal from the South Wales Coalfield. He also adopted large bearing surfaces to reduce wear, something common in North America. Churchward is creditedTuplin (1971) pp.78‚Äì84, and Hollingsworth pp.70‚Äì71 with introducing to Britain several refinements from American and French steam locomotive practice. Among these were the tapered boiler and the casting of cylinders and saddles together, in halves. His choice of outside cylinders for express locomotives was also not standard in Britain for that time. Many elements of British practice were retained, of course. His locomotives for the most part used British plate frames, and the crew was accommodated in typical British fashion. The selection of a domeless boiler was more common to Britain than to the US. =Notable locomotives= GWR 3700 Class GWR 3700 Class No. 3433 City of Bath showing tapered boiler and Belpaire firebox In September 1902, whilst still assisting Dean, Churchward had a member of the Atbara Class, no. 3405 Mauritius, reboilered with Belpaire firebox and the first use of a tapered boiler on the GWR. Once he became CME, the boiler became the prototype for Churchward's GWR Standard No. 4 boiler. This experiment led to the design of the City' class, with the first outshopped from Swindon in March 1903, No. 3433 City of Bath. It was fitted with the final form of the Standard No.4 boiler, with slightly curved sides and a tapered top to the firebox. The class soon became one of the most famous classes of locomotives in the world, when City of Truro became the first engine in the world to haul a train at 100 miles per hour in 1904 (although unauthenticated). 4-6-0 Experimental locomotives In 1901, whilst still assistant to Dean, the GWR board approved Churchward's plan to build a series of two cylinder 4-6-0 locomotives. No. 100 was out-shopped in February 1902, named Dean (later William Dean) in June 1902 to mark the latter's retirement. It incorporated a domeless parallel boiler, raised Belpaire firebox, diameter outside cylinders with piston stroke, and boiler pressure of . The piston valves were driven by rocking levers actuated by the expansion link of Stephenson valve gear ‚Äì this particular design was only used on no. 100. No. 98 was out-shopped in March 1903, to a similar design but with a taper boiler, re-designed valve gear layout and cylinders, and a shorter wheelbase. Valve diameters were increased from to .Great Western Society ‚Äì GW 2900 Class overview (Accessed 26 April 2009) No. 171 was out-shopped in December 1903, incorporating the improvements to No. 98 but with a boiler and minor amendments to the heating surface and grate area. Built as a 4-6-0, in October 1904 it was converted to a 4-4-2 to enable better comparison with the performance of the French de Glehn compound; it was reconverted to 4-6-0 in July 1907. Named Albion in 1904, it received a superheated boiler in 1910. Experimental French locomotives On succeeding Dean, the GWR board authorised Churchward to purchase three French de Glehn-du Bousquet four- cylinder compound locomotives, in order to evaluate the benefits of compounding. Similar to the Paris-Orleans Railway's 3001 class and built by Soci√©t√© Alsacienne de Constructions M√©caniques, the first locomotive no.102 La France was delivered in 1903, with Nos. 103 and 104 purchased in 1905. The locomotives had two high pressure cylinders fitted between the frames, and two low pressure cylinders outside. Each was initially fitted with a standard- pattern GWR chimney, a GWR tender and had their numbers positioned in GWR fashion on the sides of the cab. They were then each placed into service to evaluate performance, and then following engine crew feedback were modified to test other aspects of Churchward's design experimentation and philosophy. In 1926, the three locomotives were based at Oxford shed. In operational practice, these compounding did not provide any significant improvement in either performance or economy compared to No 171 Albion, Churchward's prototype 4-6-0, which was converted to a 4-4-2 specifically for direct comparison with them. GWR 2900 Saint class Experimental 4-6-0 No. 171 formed the basis of the GWR 2900 Saint Class. It appeared in four production series built between 1905 and 1913, each of which differed in dimensions. There were also differences between members of each series in terms of the boilers used, wheel arrangement (Churchward was unsure of the choice between 4-4-2 and 4-6-0), and arrangements for superheating. The locomotives performed well as passenger locomotives over all the long-distance routes of the GWR and on all but the fastest express trains until they gradually became displaced to secondary services by the Castle Class in the late 1920s and 1930s. However, the driving wheels limited their usefulness on freight trains. Churchward had recognized this limitation by the introduction of his GWR 4700 Class 2-8-0 design with driving wheels in 1919, intended for express goods trains. However, Churchward's successor Charles Collett felt that a smaller-wheeled version of the ‚ÄòSaint‚Äô class could form the basis of a successful mixed traffic class of locomotives. He therefore rebuilt No. 2925 Saint Martin with driving wheels to become the prototype of his successful Hall Class locomotives. Thus the 2900 class became a template for later GWR 2-cylinder 4-6-0 classes including the Modified Hall, Grange, Manor and County classes, all of which were of the same basic design. The class incorporated many revolutionary advances which were influential in British locomotive design for the next fifty years. According to The Great Western Society, 'Saint' class locomotives \\"represented one of the most important steps forward in railway traction of the 20th century\\", and they \\"are now acknowledged to have had a profound influence on almost every aspect of subsequent steam locomotive development\\". The Great Bear The Great Bear GWR 111 The Great Bear was the first 4-6-2 (Pacific) locomotive used on a railway in Great Britain, the only one of that type ever built by the GWR, which is today seen as Churchward's notable failure in locomotive design. No clear GWR commercial reason existed for the design, so it is concluded by many as a further Churchward experiment, considered to explore what came beyond the Star Class when train loads increased beyond their capability. Basically a developed Star class locomotive, the larger boiler over trailing wheels allowed a firebox surface of , a 17.5% increase in size compared to the Star Class. It was also built with a Swindon No. 1 superheater. Due to its weight and axle load, the locomotive was restricted to the Paddington to Bristol main line, mainly under Paddington driver Thomas Blackall, originally from Aston Tirrold, Oxfordshire. Despite later experimental developments, in service the performance of The Great Bear proved to be disappointing, and not a significant improvement on existing classes. The excellent performance of the Star Class and advent of the First World War brought a stop to further experimentation without significant improvement. Although not a technical success, The Great Bear was considered the company's flagship locomotive from its introduction until Churchward's retirement in 1922. With the introduction of 4073 Caerphilly Castle in 1923 with a higher tractive effort, the locomotive ceased to have any publicity value and became an embarrassment. Due for heavy repairs in January 1924, it was withdrawn from service by Churchward's successor Charles Collett. It emerged from Swindon later that year as a 4-6-0 Castle Class, given the name Viscount Churchill. =Legacy= In 1922 Churchward retired, and C. B. Collett inherited his legacy of excellent, standardised designs. These designs influenced British locomotive practice to the end of steam. Major classes built by the LMS and even British Railways 50 years later are clearly developments of Churchward's basic designs. The LMS Stanier Class 5 4-6-0 and the BR standard class 5 are both derived from his Saint class early examples of which date to 1902.Tuplin (1971) p.94 BR Western Region class 47 locomotive no. D1664 (later 47079) was named George Jackson Churchward upon delivery in February 1965. It was renamed G. J. Churchward in March 1979, and the name was removed in October 1987. Death Although Churchward had retired in 1922, he continued to live in a GWR-owned house near to the line at Swindon, and he retained his interest in the company's affairs. He never married.Daniel On 19 December 1933, now with poor eyesight and hard of hearing, he was inspecting a defectively-bedded sleeper on the down through line, when he was struck and killed by a Paddington to Fishguard express, pulled by No. 4085 'Berkeley Castle'. The locomotive was of the GWR Castle class, a successful design by Charles Collett derived from Churchward's \\"Star\\" class. He is buried at Christ Church in Old Town, Swindon. The home ground of the football team in Churchward's birthplace of Stoke Gabriel, Stoke Gabriel A.F.C., is named the G.J. Churchward Memorial Ground in honour of his legacy.

As an international non-governmental organization (NGO) it enjoys consultative status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations and is associated with the United Nations Department of Public Information. The organization aims at promoting peaceful co-existence among all nations, in particular the dialogue among civilizations; a just international economic order; global respect for human rights; and the international rule of law. The IPO has members in more than 70 countries on all continents and organizes conferences and expert meetings on issues of conflict resolution, civilizational dialogue, international law, and United Nations reform. The organization publishes the series Studies in International Relations (since 1978) and monographs in the field of international relations theory. The president of the IPO is Dr. Hans K√∂chler, the Chairman of the Department of Philosophy at the University of Innsbruck, Austria. The organization was founded in Innsbruck (Austria) in 1972 by a group of students from Austria, Egypt and India who felt a need for a new approach towards North-South relations and development partnership. Among the original supporters of the organization were the then Austrian President Rudolf Kirchschl√§ger, Senegalese President L√©opold S√©dar Senghor, and Indian President Gyani Zail Singh. Activities I.P.O. President Hans Koechler, left, with Field Marshal Abdul Rahman Sowar El-Dahab, former Head of State of Sudan, right, at UN headquarters in New York, 17 June 1988 Since 1974 the IPO has organized a series of lectures and conferences on the cultural dimension of international affairs (Amman 1974; Innsbruck 1974; Vienna 1979; Rome 1981; Nicosia 1984); these activities preceded the current global discourse on the dialogue of civilizations in which the I.P.O. has participated through the organization of expert meetings in Europe and the Muslim world. In 1987 the IPO initiated (in co-operation with Nobel Laureate Se√°n MacBride) the Lawyers' Appeal Against Nuclear War which led to a worldwide civil society campaign for a resolution by the UN General Assembly calling for an Advisory Opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the question of the legality of nuclear arms. In September 1991 the IPO convened the Second International Conference On A More Democratic United Nations (CAMDUN-2) at the United Nations Office at Vienna. In 2000 the Secretary-General of the United Nations nominated two officials of the organization as international observers at the Lockerbie trial in the Netherlands (see also: Pan Am Flight 103 and Hans K√∂chler's Lockerbie trial observer mission). Since 1985, the IPO has been calling for a democratization of the United Nations Organization, in particular of the UN Security Council. Since 1987, the organization has been dealing with the problem of international terrorism, repeatedly suggesting a legal definition of terrorism by the UN General Assembly. The various initiatives and proposals are documented in the IPO conference proceedings. In addition to the organization of lectures and international conferences, the IPO has undertaken (since 1980) monitoring missions in the fields of human rights and the rule of law.

He was born to Vichitravirya's first wife Ambika. Dhritarashtra was born blind \\"Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide\\", by Roshen Dalal, p. 230, publisher = Penguin Books India. He fathered one hundred sons and one daughter, Dushala, by his wife, Gandhari and a son, Yuyutsu, by Sughada, his wife's maid. These children, including the eldest son Duryodhana, came to be known as the Kauravas. Gandhari, his wife, sacrificed her eyesight, as he was blind, by blindfolding herself; hence, she could not see.  Etymology  Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra means \\"He who supports/bears the nation\\"  Historicity  Atma vidya to King Dh·πõtarƒÅ·π£·π≠ra A historical Kuru King named Dhritarashtra Vichitravirya is mentioned in the Kathaka Samhita of the Yajurveda ( 1200‚Äì900 BCE) as a descendant of the Rigvedic-era king, Sudas. His cattle was reportedly destroyed as a result of the conflict with the vratya ascetics; however, this Vedic mention does not provide corroboration for the accuracy of the Mahabharata's account of his reign.Michael Witzel (1990), \\"On Indian Historical Writing\\", p.9 of PDF  Birth and early life  With Vichitravirya having died of sickness, Bhishma unable to take the throne because of his vow, and Bahlika's line unwilling to leave Bahlika Kingdom, there was a succession crisis in Hastinapur. Satyavati invites her son Vyasa to impregnate the queens Ambika and Ambalika under the Niyoga practice. When Vyasa went to impregnate Ambika, his scary appearance frightened her, so she closed her eyes during their union; hence, her son was born blind. Dhritarashtra, along with his younger half-brother Pandu is trained in the military arts by Bhishma and Kripacharya. Hindered by his handicap, Dhritarashtra is unable to wield weapons, but has the strength of one hundred thousand elephants due to boon given by Vyasa, and is said to be so strong that he can crush iron with his bare hands.Ganguli, Kisari Mohan. The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa Translated into English Prose by Kisari Mohan Ganguli. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Web. When it came time to nominate an heir, Vidura suggested that Pandu would be a better fit because he was not blind. Though bitter at the result, Dhritarashtra willingly conceded the crown, though this act would flower into the protectiveness he would have over his crown later in life.KalyƒÅ·πáakara, BƒÅ Ha. DhrÃ•tarƒÅsh·π≠ra. NƒÅgap≈´ra: ƒÄkƒÅ·πÖkshƒÅ PrakƒÅ≈õana, 2007. Dhritarashtra marries Gandhari of Hastinapur's weakened and lowly vassal Ghandar; Gandhari covers her eyes with cloth in order to better understand her husband's blindness.Suri, Chander Kanta. The Life and times of Shakuni. Delhi: for All, 1992. Print He and Gandhari had one hundred sons, called the Kauravas and one daughter Dushala. He also had a son named Yuyutsu with a concubine.  Reign  After the incident with Rishi Kindama Pandu retired to the forest. Hence, Dhritarashtra became the de facto king. Through the blessings of Durvasa, he and Gandhari have one hundred sons and a daughter, with his oldest son, Duryodhana, becoming his heir. Upon Duryodhana's birth, ill omens appeared; many sages and consultants advised Dhritarashtra and Gandhari to abandon the baby. But they refused to do so; Duryodhana grows up with a princely education and his parents thought that he will be a great heir. alt= However, when Pandu dies, Kunti and her sons come to Hastinapur, living alongside Dhritarashtra's children. Yudhishthira, Pandu's eldest son, is older than Duryodhana. Given that Pandu was the king and that Yudhishthira is born of the god Dharma, he has a strong claim to the throne. A succession crisis begins; though recognizing Yudhishthira's merits, Dhritarashtra favours his own son, blind to his faults. Upon much pressure from the Brahmin council, Vidura, and Bhishma, Dhritarashtra reluctantly names Yudhishthira as his heir. = Division of Hastinapura = After the lakshagraha incident, in which the Pandavas are apparently killed, Dhritarashtra mourns but is able to finally name Duryodhana as his heir. When the Pandavas are revealed to have survived, Duryodhana refuses to cede his title as heir when the obviously sour relations between the Kauravas and the Pandavas come to focus. On Bheeshma's advise, Dhritarashtra splits the country in two, giving Hastinapur to Duryodhana and Khandavprastha to Yudhishthira. = The game of dice = Draupadi disrobed in Dhritarashtra's assembly. Dhritarashtra seated in the centre. Shakuni, Gandhari's brother, was a master of dice as he could control them. He along with his nephew Duryodhana conspired in a game of dice and invited the Pandavas to gamble. The Pandavas eventually lost their kingdom, wealth, and prestige and were exiled for thirteen years. Draupadi, the wife of the Pandavas, was humiliated in court after Dushasana tried to disrobe her. The helpless blind king only intervened after counseling with Gandhari when Draupadi was going to curse the Kuru dynasty. Though individuals like Vikarna and Vidura objected to the wrongdoing of Duryodhana, most of the spectators were helpless due to their obligations to Hastinapur; Dhritarashtra could have spoken out but did not.  Battle of Kurukshetra  Lord Krishna as a peace emissary of Pandavas traveled to Hastinapura persuading Kauravas to avoid bloodshed of their own kin. However, Duryodhana conspired to arrest him that resulted in failure of the mission. After Krishna's peace mission failed and the war seemed inevitable, Vyasa approached Dhritarashtra and offered to grant him divine vision, so that Dhritarashtra could see the war. However, not willing to see his kin slaughtered, Dhritarashtra asked that the boon be given to Sanjaya his charioteer. Sanjaya dutifully narrates the war to his liege, reporting how Bhima killed all his children. Sanjaya would console the blind king while challenging the king with his own viewpoints and morals. When Lord Krishna displayed his Vishvarupa (Universal Form) to Arjuna on the battlefield of Kurukshetra, Dhritarashtra regretted not possessing the divine sight. Dhritarashtra was confident that Bhishma, Drona, Karna and other invincible warriors would make the Kaurava camp victorious. He rejoiced whenever the tide of war turned against the Pandavas. However, the results of the war devastated him. All of his sons and grandsons were killed in the carnage. Dhritarashtra's only daughter Duhsala was widowed. Yuyutsu had defected to Pandava side at the onset of war and was the only son of Dhritrashtra who had managed to survive Kurukshetra War.Yuyutsu was one of the 11 who managed to survive the war. = Crushing of Bhima's metal statue = Dhritarashtra was furious with Bhima for mercilessly slaying all his sons, especially Duryodhana. After the war ended, the victorious Pandavas arrived at Hastinapur for the formal transfer of power. The Pandavas go to embrace their uncle and give their respects. Dhritarashtra hugged Yudhishthira heartily. When Dhritarashtra turned to Bhima, Lord Krishna sensed the danger and asked Bhima to move Duryodhana's iron statue of Bhima (used by the prince for training) in his place. Dhritarashtra crushed the statue into pieces, and then broke down crying, his anger leaving him. Broken and defeated, Dhritarashtra apologized for his folly and wholeheartedly embraced Bhima and the other Pandavas.During the Kurukshetra War  Later years and death  Kunti leading Dhritarashtra and Gandhari as she goes to the forest in exile After the great war of Mahabharata, the grief-stricken blind king along with his wife Gandhari, sister-in-law Kunti, and half brother Vidura left Hastinapur for penance. It is believed that all of them (except Vidura who predeceased him) perished in a forest fire and attained Moksha.Dhritarashtra, Gandhari and Kunti proceed to forest Assessment Throughout his reign as King of Hastinapur, Dhritarashtra was torn between the principles of dharma and his love for his son Duryodhana, and often ended up endorsing his son's actions merely out of fatherly love. Dhritarashtra is physically strong yet mentally weak, who is easily manipulated by his brother in law, Shakuni. Dhritarashtra appears in MahƒÅbhƒÅrata sections that have been circulated as separate scriptures, most notably the Bhagavad Gita, whose dialogue was narrated to him.

Shatter cones are rare geological features that are only known to form in the bedrock beneath meteorite impact craters or underground nuclear explosions. They are evidence that the rock has been subjected to a shock with pressures in the range of . Morphology Shatter cones have a distinctively conical shape that radiates from the top (apex) of the cones repeating cone-on-cone in large and small scales in the same sample. Sometimes they have more of a spoon shape on the side of a larger cone. In finer-grained rocks such as limestone, they form an easily recognizable \\"horsetail\\" pattern with thin grooves (striae). However, the word \\"striae\\" should not be used to describe shatter cones, as that is considered misleading. Coarser grained rocks tend to yield less well developed shatter cones, which may be difficult to distinguish from other geological formations such as slickensides. Geologists have various theories of what causes shatter cones to form, including compression by the wave as it passes through the rock or tension as the rocks rebound after the pressure subsides. The result is large and small branching fractures throughout the rocks. Shatter cones can range in size from microscopic to several meters. The largest known shatter cone in the world (more than 10 metres in length) is located at the Slate Islands in Terrace Bay, Ontario, Canada. The azimuths of the cones' axes typically radiate outwards from the point of impact, with the cones pointing upwards and toward the center of the impact crater, although the orientations of some of the rocks have been changed by post-cratering geological processes at the site.

The kingdom represented the core homeland of the D√°l gCais people, although there were other Gaels in the area such as the √âile and E√≥ganachta, and even the Norse of Limerick. It existed from the collapse of the Kingdom of Munster in the 12th century as competition between the √ì Briain and the Mac C√°rthaigh led to the schism between Thomond (\\"North Munster\\") and Desmond (\\"South Munster\\"). It continued to exist outside of the Anglo-Norman controlled Lordship of Ireland until the 16th century. The exact origin of Thomond, originally as an internal part of Munster, is debated. It is generally held that the D√©isi Muman pushed north-west starting from the 5th to the early 8th century, taking the area from the U√≠ Fiachrach Aidhne of the Connachta. Eventually, the D√°l gCais rose to power in all of Munster, to the detriment of the E√≥ganachta. The person most famously associated with this is Brian Boru, High King of Ireland, best known for his feats at the Battle of Clontarf. Four generations down the line and after providing three more High Kings, the D√°l gCais were unable to hold onto all of Munster and so Thomond came into being as a separate entity. Between the mid-12th and late 13th century, when much of Ireland came under direct English control and/or settlement, Thomond too came into the Anglo-Irish sphere. The de Clare family established a colony at Bunratty, while the Butler and FitzGerald families also made inroads. However, from the time of the Battle of Dysert O'Dea, Thomond was restored as a kingdom, with its rulers reinstating Limerick within their overrule. Not until the 1540s did the ruling O'Brien dynasty accommodate with English rule. Geography County Clare was sometimes known as County Thomond in the period immediately after its creation from the District of Thomond.Luminarium Encyclopedia: Biography of Sir Henry Sidney (1529‚Äì1586).

History =Creation from Munster= The entire Province of Munster was under the control of the O'Brien (Ua Briain) clan under the leadership of Toirrdelbach Ua Briain and his son Muirchertach from 1072-1114. Their capital was located in Limerick. In a bid to secure the High Kingship of Ireland for the clan, Muirchertach encouraged ecclesiastical reform in 1111 with the creation of territorial dioceses over the entire island. They had support for their bid from several foreign connections including the Norwegian king Magnus Bareleg and the Anglo-Norman baron Arnulf de Montgomery, who were both united to the clan through marriage in 1102. Their claim to the High Kingship was countered by the O'Neill (U√≠ N√©ill) clan in Ulster under the leadership of Domnall MacLochlainn of Ailech. Though Muirchertach campaigned hard in the north, he was unable to obtain the submission of Ailech. When he fell ill in 1114 he was deposed by his brother Diarmait. Muirchertach did briefly regain power, but after his death in 1119 his brother's sons took control of the clan. MacLochlainn's plans to restore the High Kingship to the north was thwarted by his ally Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair of Connacht who formed an alliance with the O'Brien's. In 1118 Conchobair partitioned Munster between the sons of Diarmait and Tagh Mac Carthaig. The northern section of the province became the O'Brien Kingdom of Thomond (Tuadh Mhumhain \\"North Munster\\") and the southern became the Mac Carthaigh Kingdom of Desmond (Deas Mhumhain \\"South Munster\\"). =Normans and Civil Wars= From the 12th to the 14th centuries, the Norman invasion and their multiple attempts to take Thomond from the Gaels was the main challenge to the realm. The picture was complicated by rival branches of the √ì Briain trying to ally with various different Normans to enforce their own line as reigning over Thomond. At the time of the Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169, Domhnall M√≥r √ì Briain was king of Thomond. Domhnall was a man of realpolitik; his main concern was upholding his position in Thomond and was not against collaborating with Strongbow and others against rival Gaelic kingdoms such as Ossory, Desmond and Connacht. Domhnall even acknowledged Henry II as Lord of Ireland at Cashel in 1171, but a mere two years later when Plantagenet tried to grant Thomond to Philip de Braose this situation was overturned. The D√°l gCais defeated a Norman army at the Battle of Thurles in 1174, where over 1700 Normans were killed. The following year when Raymond le Gros captured Limerick through a naval invasion, Domhnall re-took it and burned it rather than have it in foreign hands.The psychological effect that this gesture had on the Normans is evident from when Philip de Braose, Robert FitzStephen and Miles de Cogan rode out to take Limerick city and fled in a great panic upon seeing it in flames. Realising that Domhnall M√≥r and the D√°l gCais would sooner burn it to the ground than have anyone but themselves rule it. The twenty years after that for the Gaels of Thomond were more secure. Corcomroe Abbey is the final resting place of Conor na Siudane Ua Briain, who has a stone effigy there. After the death of Domhnall M√≥r a period of destructive feuding among his offspring caused a great territorial decline in Thomond. The brothers Muircheartach Finn √ì Briain and Conchobhar Ruadh √ì Briain fought with each other, seeing Muircheartach's reign interrupted between 1198-1203. Muirchertach himself was blinded by the Normans in 1208 and was soon forced into abdication due to no longer being righdamhna. Donnchadh Cairprech √ì Briain had to deal with dissent from the Mac Con Mara and √ì Coinn against his rule, so brought in the Laigin's Mac Gorm√°in as his standard bearers. Donnchadh also enlisted the support of the de Burgh and other Normans in this fight, which came at a costly price; Limerick and lands surrounding it in what would later become County Limerick and County Tipperary.The Normans also attempted to takeover the key religious post of Bishop of Killaloe. Geoffrey de Marisco promoted his nephew Robert Travers into the post in 1215, with support of the English monarchy. The Gaels disputed his election to Pope Honorius III and in this case Rome took their side, deposing Travers in 1221 in favour of Domhnall √ì h√âanna. Under pressure from the Butlers, Thomond was now not too different to what would become County Clare, protected by the River Shannon. Donnchadh moved his capital to Clonroad. The Normans advance continued during the reign of Conchobhar na Suidaine √ì Briain, as Henry III \\"granted\\" lands to Robert de Muscregos and John Fitzgeoffrey. Of the two de Muscregos was most active, constructing Clare Castle and Bunratty Castle with a colony. The precedent for Thomond was very dangerous as, should much more land have been taken, the realm would have no longer existed. Conchobhar and his fiery son Tadhg Cael Uisce √ì Briain took up arms and slaughtered many of the Norman settler-colonists in 1257. The following year, the Gaelic chiefs from all over Ireland had resolved to form an anti-Norman pact and met at Cael Uisce, near Lough Erne to discuss terms. They planned to resurrect the High Kingship of Ireland, with most supporting Brian √ì N√©ill as the choice. Tadhg was proud and stubborn, declaring his father should be High King; the D√°l gCais thus did not take part in the Battle of Druim Dearg, which the Gaels lost, damaging the reputation of Thomond as a consequence. Donnchadh mac Brian √ì Briain's quest ended when he drowned in the River Fergus. Brian Ruadh √ì Briain kept the pressure up by burning Clare Castle and forcing the de Muscregos' to flee to Wales, but he had troubles from his own countrymen. The Mac Con Mara, √ì De√°ghaidh and Mac Gorm√°in clans supported his nephew Toirdelbach √ì Briain, a son of Tadhg Cael Uisce, for the kingship instead and revolted. Seeing an opportunity, Edward II offered Thomond to Thomas de Clare if he could take advantage of the √ì Briain feud. The events which followed have passed down to history as the Cathreim Thoirdhealbhaigh. After Brian briefly regained Clonroad with de Clare's help, Toirdelbach arrived with support from Galway in the form of the de Burghs and once again took control in 1277. Brian was executed by his \\"ally\\" at Bunratty, but de Clare was soon reconciled with his son Donnchadh mac Brian √ì Briain and supported him against Toirdelbach. The feud continued until Donnchadh drowned at a party on Islandmagrath, on the River Fergus. With Toirdelbach now undisputed king, the Mac Con Mara were able to hound de Clare. The conflict between the two lines continued into the next generation between Donnchadh mac Toirdelbach √ì Briain (backed by William Liath de Burgh) and Diarmuid Cl√©irech √ì Briain (backed by Richard de Clare). There was military success at Bunratty in 1311 for Diarmuid and his cousin Donnchadh was killed at Corcomroe. Following this, Clann Tadhg's leader was Muircheartach mac Toirdelbach √ì Briain and after Diarmuid's \\"sudden\\" death, Clann Briain Ruadh's leader became Donnchadh mac Domhnall √ì Briain. The Bruce Wars in Ireland added an unpredictable element and saw some surprising ad hoc alliances come into play. Donnchadh elected to support Edward the Bruce, which made his patron de Clare an enemy. Muircheartach who now reigned supreme in Thomond, due to his connection to de Burgh, was nominally on the side of the Lordship of Ireland. The cousins fought at the Second Battle of Athenry. Muircheartach's brother Diarmuid mac Toirdelbach √ì Briain managed to destroy Donnchadh and most of Clann Briain Ruadh's supporters at the Battle of Corcomroe in 1317. The end of the de Clares and Norman territorial claims in Thomond came the following year at the Battle of Dysert O'Dea, due largely to Conchobhar √ì De√°ghaidh, whose tactics secured a famous victory. =Unity and Resurgence= The last successful attempt by a Norman to play divide and conquer within the Thomond kingship was the case of Maurice FitzGerald, Earl of Desmond. A very powerful man, he was constantly rumoured during his life to have wanted to make himself King of Ireland. He successfully sponsored Brian B√°n √ì Briain in overthrowing Diarmuid from Clan Tadhg during 1343-1350, but equally decisive was the sides taken by Mac Con Mara, leading to Diarmuid's restoration. With the exception of a failed Norman attempt to reconstruct Bunratty Castle by Thomas de Rokeby from 1353-1355, the Norman settler-colonialist project in Thomond was at an end until the submission of the √ì Briain in the 16th century. The Norman Lordship was weakened by the Bruce Wars of 1315-1318, the Black Death of 1349-1350 (which disproportionally hit Norman controlled towns) and besides that English forces were more invested with the Hundred Years' War in France and their own internal conflict the Wars of the Roses to focus too much on Ireland. All of these factors allowed for a 15th-century Gaelic resurgence, not only in Thomond but across a significant part of Ireland outside of the Pale. Sioda Cam Mac Con Mara who was made warden of Limerick in 1369, also rebuilt Quin Abbey in the 1350s. Brian B√°n was the last of Clann Briain Ruadh to hold the kingship and from 1350 onwards, Clann Tadhg held sway. Mathghamhain Maonmhaighe √ì Briain came to power before the death of his uncle Diarmuid and he was named as such because he spent time as a foster child in M√°enmaige. His succession was disputed by his uncle and brother; Toirdelbhach Maol √ì Briain and Brian Sreamhach √ì Briain. Of the two Brian Sreamhach gained the upper hand and when his uncle tried to enlist the help of the Earl of Desmond to wrestle back the realm, Brian thoroughly routed them at Croom in a key military success. This had the added benefit of winning back Limerick for Thomond and Sioda Cam Mac Con Mara was placed in the city as a warden in 1369. The friendship with the de Burghs of Galway was maintained by Brian and when Richard II was at Waterford in 1399, he paid nominal homage and was well received. Thomond was now in such a position that Conchobhar mac Mathghamhna √ì Briain's twenty six-year reign was marked as a time of peace and plenty. The years 1426-1459 were marked by a succession of three sons of Brian Sreamhach reigning; Tadhg an Glemore √ì Briain, Mathghamhain Dall √ì Briain and Toirdelbhach B√≥g √ì Briain. During this time, Mathghamhain Dall was deposed by his brother Toirdelbhach with the familiar military assistance of the de Burghs (whom he had formed a marriage alliance with). Greater things were to come from the ascent of Toirdelbhach's son Tadhg an Chomhaid √ì Briain. From Inchiquin, Tadhg took advantage of the Wars of the Roses, forming an alliance with the √ì N√©ill in 1464. He managed to ride south through Desmond (the rest of the old Munster) and enforce the c√≠os dubh on the Anglo-Normans. This was a kind of Gaelic pizzo which Tadgh's great-grandfather Mathghamhain Maonmhaighe had first been able to enforce as a price of protection. His military prowess was such that the Earl of Desmond was forced to give back to Thomond what would later become County Limerick. Mac Fhirbhisigh hints that the men of Leinster planned to raise Tadhg to the High Kingship of Ireland before his death and claims he was the greatest √ì Briain since Brian B√≥ruma himself. Thomond was wealthy in the 15th century; Domhnall Mac Gorm√°in (died 1484) was described as the richest man in Ireland in terms of live stock. During the reign of Conchobhar na Srona √ì Briain, Thomond maintained alliances with the Mac William Uachtar of Clanricarde and the Butlers. In the latter case, they were opposing the Kildare FitzGeralds, earning the ire of Gerald FitzGerald, Earl of Kildare who had earned the favour of the new Tudor king Henry VII as Lord Deputy of Ireland. Despite Kildare's fearsome reputation, Conchobhar met him in battle at Ballyhickey, near Quin, in 1496 and was successful in turning him back. Toirdelbhach Donn √ì Briain as part of his pact with Ulick Fionn Burke took part in the Battle of Knockdoe in 1504; along with the Mac Con Mara and √ì Briain Ara; against the Earl of Kildare, which they lost. The struggle had been started by a feud between de Burgh and the Ui Maine. √ì Briain later defeated Kildare at Moin na Brathair, near Limerick. Thomond intended to support the √ì N√©ill against the √ì Domhnaill in a northern feud, but by the time √ì Briain arrived, it was over. Toirdelbhach's life came to an end trying to defend the √ì Cearbhaill of √âile from the Earl of Ormond at Camus, near Cashel; he died \\"by the shot of a ball.\\" =Downfall of the Realm= The downfall of Thomond was set off by the rebellion of Silken Thomas. The downfall of Thomond occurred in the 16th century. The series of events leading up to it, were set into process by the rebellion of FitzGerald family member, the Earl of Kildare, Silken Thomas. In 1534, a rumour had spread that his father, the Lord Deputy of Ireland, had been executed in England on the orders of king Henry VIII and that the same fate was planned for him and his uncles. Under this impression, Thomas threw off his offices in the Kingdom of Ireland and rose up in rebellion. He took refuge with the √ì Cearbhaill of √âile and then with Conchobhar mac Toirdhealbaig √ì Briain at Clonroad, Ennis. In hot pursuit, at the head of an army, was Lord Leonard Grey, who destroyed the Killaloe Bridge, which had the result of isolating Thomond from the rest of Ireland and also attacked the D√°l gCais east of the River Shannon. Although the Silken Thomas issue was resolved by late 1535, Thomond had marked itself out by providing refuge to enemies of the Crown of England in Ireland. The English forces had in turn enlisted the services of Conchobhar's own son Donnchadh √ì Briain who had cemented an alliance with the Butler family by marrying the daughter of the Earl of Ormond. According to Butler, Donnchadh pledged to help them conquer Thomond, aid English colonisation, adopt English laws and help them take over Carrigogunnell Castle. This castle was a symbol of Gaelic defiance, as it had remained out of Anglo-Norman hands for over 200 years. When the castle was attacked by Grey, it surrendered due to Donnchadh. With the loss of east Thomond and the destruction of O'Brien's Bridge, Thomond was in a lot of trouble. Conchobhar, along with loyal supporters such as the Mac Con Mara, continued to fight on and managed to conclude a truce with Grey in 1537. Conchobhar was succeeded on his death by his brother Murchadh Carrach √ì Briain, a man who initially attempted to assist Conn Bacach √ì N√©ill in the defence of T√≠r Eoghain but had come to see the futility of his opposition and agreed to surrender and regrant to the Tudor state. The Parliament of the Kingdom of Ireland was called to Limerick in 1542 by Lord Deputy Anthony St. Leger regarding the terms of submission of Murchadh Carrach √ì Briain and Sioda Mac Con Mara. Becoming members of the Peerage of Ireland and converting to the Anglican Church, Murchadh was made Earl of Thomond and Donnchadh also Baron Ibrackan. Dissent took place in the form of Donchadh's brother Domhnall √ì Briain (and his ally Tadhg √ì Briain) who claimed to have been inaugurated Chief of the √ì Briain according to the Gaelic fashion in 1553. This was in opposition to his nephew the Earl, Conchobhar Groibleach √ì Briain. Tied into English political rivalries, Conchobhar had the support of the Earl of Sussex but was not able to decisively defeat his uncle, indeed Domhnall scored a victory at the Battle of Spancel Hill in 1559. The discord dragged on and Thomond was under the martial law of William Drury as late as 1577. The issues pertaining to tax and land were finalised at the Composition of Thomond in 1585. Diocese of Killaloe Ennis Friary, under the Franciscans, was founded in 1242 and was greatly favoured by the kings of Thomond. The religion which predominated at an official level in Thomond was Catholic Christianity. The territory of Thomond was associated with the Diocese of Killaloe under the Bishop of Killaloe, which had been formed in 1111 at the Synod of R√°th Breasail, seven years before Thomond broke fully from the Kingdom of Munster. D√°l gCais influence over the Bishop of Limerick differed from time to time, with Norman influence also being part of the picture. At the Synod of Kells in 1152, three more sees in Thomond were created in the form of the Diocese of Kilfenora, the Diocese of Roscrea and the Diocese of Scattery Island. Roscrea was re-merged with Killaloe in 1168 and Scattery Island followed in 1189. The latter was re-created briefly during the 14th century before once again being merged back with Killaloe. Some of the Bishops of Killaloe attended Ecumenical Councils of the Catholic Church in Rome; this includes Constant√≠n √ì Briain who participated in the Third Lateran Council and Conchobhar √ì h√âanna who was at the Fourth Lateran Council. Religious orders were present in Thomond and had establishments founded by them under the patronage of Kings of Thomond. This includes; the Canons Regular of the Augustinians at Canon Island Abbey, Clare Abbey, Inchicronan Priory, Killone Abbey and Limerick Priory, the Cistercians at Holy Cross Abbey, Corcomroe Abbey, Kilcooly Abbey and Monasteranenagh Abbey, the Franciscans at Ennis Abbey, Galbally Friary and Quin Abbey (the latter of which became a formidable college) and the Dominicans at Limerick Blackfriars.

These did not have the leather shoulder patches of the modern work jacket. A donkey jacket is a medium-length workwear jacket, typically made of unlined black or dark blue thick Melton woollen fabric, with the shoulders back and front reinforced and protected from rain with leather or PVC panels. Originating in the United Kingdom, the garment is untailored at the waist such that it hangs down straight from the shoulders. The front vertical edges fall straight and are squared-off at the bottom edge which is also straight horizontally with no vent at the back. In length it reaches below the crotch area. It has no lapels and is closed by four to five buttons at the front that fasten tightly up to the neck with a broad and stiff turn-up collar, allowing the wearer to protect the neck from wind, cold and wet weather. It is thus well suited to outdoors work in demanding conditions.  Origins  In 1888 George Key opened up his own shop above his father John Key's first-floor draper shop on Lower Brook Street in Rugeley Staffordshire, England. That same year, Key designed a new type of coat made of a hard-wearing material developed for those who were working on the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal. Some of the navvies worked on donkey engines (a steam-powered winch or logging engine), providing the inspiration for the name of George Key's new coat: the donkey jacket.  Design  The donkey jacket is derived from the wool sack coat worn by workers in the 19th century, and the Oxford English Dictionary references the term as first used in 1929: \\"one with leather shoulders and back\\".\\"donkey\\". The Oxford English Dictionary. Second Edition, 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. Retrieved November 9, 2009. The jacket usually has two capacious side pockets, and sometimes an inside \\"poacher's pocket\\". Later versions replaced the leather with a PVC panel covering the shoulder-blade areas. This could be fluorescent orange or yellow and is sometimes branded with the name of the company which supplied the jacket, or the name of the company for which the wearer worked.  Social significance  The donkey jacket is regarded as typical of the British manual labourer and trade unionist as well as members of the political left. It is also favoured by traditionalist Teddy boys, Rockabillys and skinheads.TradSkin.Org, (1999), alt.skinheads FAQ , . Retrieved 28 June 2007.Marshall, George (1991).

Introduced in 1968 as a new model positioned above the 1968 Datsun Bluebird 510, the Laurel offered the luxury of the Nissan Cedric 130 in a smaller size. The laurel is a noble tree in Greek mythology, and the laurel wreath a symbol of honorable status. In Japan, the Laurel was not marketed as a Datsun, being always labeled as a Nissan. The first Laurel was developed by the Nissan Tsurumi R&D; Division and assembled at the Musashimurayama Plant of the former Prince Motor Company in 2-door and 4-door variants. Released as a Nissan after Prince merged with Nissan, Laurels shared many components and architectures with the Skyline range. The Laurel was not marketed new in Japan at Nissan Prince Shop locations that sold the Skyline and Gloria, former Prince products. Instead the Laurel was sold at Nissan Motor Shop as the junior model to the larger V8-powered Nissan President. Since 1968, eight generations of Laurel have been produced in Japan. Nissan intermittently listed the Laurel for sale in various Asian and European markets (it was also sold in Chile and Panama, as the Datsun Laurel, starting in the late seventies), and then discontinued the export of this model from 1989. The Laurel was cancelled subsequent to Nissan's alliance with Renault. __TOC__  First generation (C30) (1968‚Äì1972)  In April 1968 Nissan presented its new Laurel in four-door deLuxe and Super deLuxe versions, both equipped with a 1.8 L inline-four engine and independent rear suspension. In June 1970 a two-door hardtop coup√© joined the lineup, as a junior version of the all-new Nissan Cedric/Gloria coupe, and one year later a 2000 cc engine became available in the four-door sedan as well. Its competitors at introduction were the Toyota Corona Mark II sedan, the Isuzu Bellel, and the Mazda Luce which was introduced in 1966. The Laurel did not sell as well as expected, largely because the design was too similar to that of the smaller, cheaper Bluebird (510) which was developed as a competitor before Nissan bought Prince. This car was developed by the Nissan Tsurumi vehicle development team, but the C30 Laurel was fitted with the Prince four- cylinder SOHC engine, the G18. (On the other hand, the GC10 Skyline 2000GT was developed by the former Prince Ogikubo vehicle development team, but was fitted with Nissan L20 six-cylinder SOHC engine.) This was of 1,815 cc capacity. The suspension is the same four-wheel independent system that was fitted on the C10 Skyline. The Laurel Hardtop model was equipped with the SOHC 1,990 cc G20-series four-cylinders. The four-door sedan was originally only available with the lesser G18. The SU twin-carburetted 2000GX received sporty equipment. August 1970 saw the release of a modified version of the four-door sedan version, now with the same roof angle as that of the hard top. The instrument panel received redesigned panel meters, and the more luxurious GL grade was added. 1972 Nissan Laurel series C30 2000GX coupe  Second generation (C130) (1972‚Äì1977)  In April 1972 the second Laurel generation appeared, again in four-door saloon and two-door hardtop coup√© form affectionately known as the Butaketsu Laurel (\\"pig's butt\\") because of its ample rear quarter panels and tail section, with the taillights incorporated into the rear bumper. The saloon now was endowed with a rear beam axle and leaf springs, while the coup√© clung to independent rear suspension. In addition to the 1.8 and 2.0 L four-cylinder engines, a 2.0 L inline-six was now available, joined, from October, 1973, by a 2.6 L six; the latter was replaced by a 2.8 L six in late 1975. The G-20 4-cylinder and L20 six-cylinder engines were equipped with SU twin carburetors but were eliminated February 1976 due to emission regulations. The styling of the coupe appears to be influenced by the 1970 Ford Torino and the 1971 Mercury Cougar, reflecting a popular styling trend during the 1960s and 1970s called \\"coke bottle\\". Sales in Japan (very few were exported) ran to about 96,000 per year, with three- quarters sedans.Motor Magazine International (January 1974), pp. 9-10 The Toyota competitor was the Mark II coup√© and sedan. Datsun 200L sedan (Europe) Engines available at the time were the four-cylinder 1815 cc G18 and 1990 cc G20, and the six-cylinder 1998 cc L20. Both the G20 and L20 were available with twin SU carburettors as an option. However, only the G20 equipped cars outwardly announced this with a \\"Twin Carburettor 2000GX\\" badge. In October 1973 the first Laurel with the 2565 cc L26 six-cylinder engine was added and badged as \\"2600SGL\\". Since the engine was over two litres, it was not restrained by the size limits imposed by Japanese regulations, and therefore it was fitted with bigger bumpers than regular Laurels. The installation of the 2.6-litre engine in Japanese models helped identify this generation as a luxury car, as the larger engine obligated Japanese drivers to pay higher amounts of annual road tax. In September 1975, in order to meet the new emissions regulations for that year, the L26 was replaced by the larger yet 2753 cc L28 six-cylinder. By October the carburettors in the L20 were replaced with electronic fuel injection and the engine was now dubbed L20E. Because of the difficulty in meeting the emissions regulations, the twin-carburetted engines were all discontinued. The 1,770 cc L18 replaced the G18 in the lineup. In February 1976 carburetted 1.8-litre and 2.0-litre engines which met the 1976 emissions regulations were introduced, and were identified with the Nissan NAPS badge. Nissan Laurel 2000SGX Hardtop (C130) with non-standard wheels = Laurel C130-EV= In 1974 Nissan developed an electric passenger sedan based on the Nissan Laurel. The Nissan Laurel C130-EV - referred to as the Datsun 200L-EV in export markets - developed to be used by the VIPs at the 1975 International Oceanographic Exposition in Okinawa. It was originally engineered by the Prince Motor Company, but produced by Nissan when the company assumed Prince operations in 1966. The C130-EV uses one electric motor, rear-mounted and driving the rear axle through a two-speed automatic transmission. The Nissan Laurel C130-EV has a claimed top speed of and a range of . Nissan's next electric car venture would be the 1998 Altra.  Third generation (C230) (1977‚Äì1980)  The third generation appeared in January 1977. For the first time, the C230 was available in either saloon and hardtop coup√© form, but also as a hardtop saloon without B-posts. The hardtop was only available with six-cylinder engines. Buyers could choose between a 1.8-litre four, a 2.0-litre inline-six (carburetted or fuel-injected, a first for the Laurel), a 2.8-litre six, or a 2.0-litre diesel four, sourced from Nissan Diesel as an alternative to the diesel-powered Toyota Mark II and the Isuzu Florian. Transmissions were mainly four- or five-speed manuals or a three-speed automatic, although a three-speed manual with a column shift was also available in the lower spec and commercial versions. In the autumn of 1978 the C230 received a mild facelift (type C231), marked visually by squared instead of round double headlights. The Toyota competitor was the Mark II coup√© and sedan. Again, comfort was prioritized over handling and agility. 1978 Nissan Laurel SGL Hardtop, rear view One year later (January 1978) Nissan released a tenth anniversary edition, which adopted a special deep red body color known as \\"Laurel's Crimson\\", as well as trim-specific emblems, aluminum wheels and front grille. In 1979 the 2.4-litre L24 engine was added to the lineup. European outputs were DIN for the 2.0 and the 2.4 inline-sixes. European buyers were attracted to the Laurel for its overall reliability, low price, and ample equipment. Datsun-Nissan South Africa also developed a two- litre four-cylinder option not offered elsewhere to suit local needs with a lower-cost, torquier engine than the two-litre six sold elsewhere. The L20B engine offered and was paired with somewhat lower equipment than the 280L sold alongside it. November 1978 brought minor changes to the Laurel, including squaring off of the front headlights. The highest trim level, \\"Medalist\\", received air conditioning in addition to its OHC four-cylinder two-litre diesel engine. The 1800 cc cars switched to the newer Z18 crossflow engine and all Laurels now met the Showa 53 (1979) gasoline vehicle emission regulations. Later, in October 1979, a two-litre four-cylinder gasoline option (Z20-series) was added in several markets. Also new were the options of automatic transmission and the SGL equipment grade on diesel vehicles. 1979 Datsun 200L (Chile) In February 1980 an electric sunroof was added to the hardtop version of the Medalist. This was the first year in which a sunroof was a model option. In July 1980 a special limited edition \\"gold medalist\\" top-of-the-line trim was released.  Fourth generation (C31) (1980‚Äì1984)  The C31 model, introduced in November 1980, was the first model that was only available in a four-door form, either as a sedan or hardtop. Engines for the C31 were 1.8-liter, 2.0-liter L20, 2.4-liter L24 gasoline, and 2.8-liter diesel. The coup√© was replaced by the new Nissan Leopard F30. The Toyota competitor was the Cresta hardtop and the Chaser sedan. November 1982 saw the introduction of the Limited \\"Givenchy Version\\" with Hubert de Givenchy doing the TV commercials in Japan, borrowing a marketing concept for an American luxury coupe, the Lincoln Continental Mark IV. In 1981, the Nissan Laurel Spirit was offered as a smaller alternative to the Laurel, while still offering the luxury content of the larger car. 1981 Datsun Laurel 2.4 Hardtop (C31, Chile) Development Supervisor, Itirou Makoto Sakurai, was in charge of developing the Laurel together with the Skyline. The Laurel's redesign was carried out in a European style and tone. The coefficient of drag (Cd value) of the four-door hardtop is 0.38. The lowest-priced Z18 is a four-cylinder engine, as is the 2-litre Z20. The L20-series are inline-six cylinder models, also available in fuel injected L20E type, and as the turbocharged L20ET - the first turbocharged Laurel. On top of the lineup was the 2.8-litre L28E, and for some export markets the 2.4-litre L24 engine (usually carburetted) was also offered. Mostly for commercial use there was the four-cylinder LD20 diesel engine, while private users usually preferred the larger six-cylinder LD28 type which was also available with much better equipment. In February 1981 the GX trim level was added. L20E sedan with independent rear suspension in the vehicle suspension formula (a six-link independent rear suspension was equipped as standard on the turbocharged cars). In November 1981 the car received some improvement and the Turbo Medalist model was new to the lineup. In September 1982 there was a minor change. Up a sense of luxury and large- scale extrusion in the chrome bumpers and rear license plate holder. The tail lamp design was changed as well. Instead of the Z18 series engine, the new OHC four-cylinder 1809 cc CA18S engine was fitted to the Laurel 1.8. The engine range was overhauled at the time and now included the CA18S, L20E, turbocharged L20ET, the four-cylinder SOHC Z20S, and the diesel LD20 and LD28-6 models. The carburetted L20, the L28E, and the column-shifted LD20 (six-seater) were discontinued. The six-cylinder gasoline-powered car with automatic transmission and Super Touring equipment received an overdrive gear at the same time. In November 1982 the Givenchy limited version was released. In February 1983 the \\"50 Special\\" released. In March the Givenchy II version went on sale. In May another 50 Special II vehicles were launched. In July electrically retractable fender and door mirrors were introduced, a first. In October, taxi and driver instruction vehicles with an OHC LPG four-cylinder engine (Z18P, Standard or GL equipment) were added. SGL Grand Touring car (with a hubcap for Medalist colored bumper and large) and 50 Special Release III. January 1984 saw the abolition of the 1.8-litre GL models, while the Givenchy III limited edition also went on sale. 1982 Datsun Laurel 2.4 SGL Sedan (C31, The Netherlands) European export models received the carburetted 2.0 (DX or SGL trim) and 2.4 inline-sixes (SGL), with and respectively, or with the large 2.8 diesel with . A fuel injected 2.4 with later appeared for some markets. The 2.4-liter six only developed in Swedish-market petrol cars as a result of that country's stringent emissions standards. As large Japanese cars are not very popular with private buyers in Europe, the diesel saw the lion's share of sales, mainly for taxi usage. Fitted with a detuned version of the L24 engine, the Laurel was introduced to the Middle Eastern (mainly Saudi) market in 1982.  Fifth generation (C32) (1984‚Äì1989)  The C32 were fitted with four gasoline engines. The CA20S (which were the only four-cylinder to be seen in the C32), the L24S the VG20ET, the VG30E and the electronic carburettor installed VG30S. It also came with the LD28 diesel. In 1987 there were a minor facelift which basically were bigger bumpers, new grilles, and new lights in the front and back. The LD28 diesel engine were swapped out in favor of the similarly dimensioned RD28. This generation became the first Laurel with a V6 engine. The C32 was the last model to be sold outside Japan. In Europe the Laurel was replaced by the Nissan Maxima which was not available as a diesel and had a sportier, more luxurious air. The Laurel was often used as a taxi in Germany. The styling of the Nissan Laurel began to resemble the larger Nissan Cedric and Nissan Gloria but on a slightly smaller platform, with reduced tax liability based on the vehicles dimensions. The Toyota competitor was the Cresta hardtop and the Chaser sedan, and in 1986 the Honda Vigor. In October 1984 the C32-facelift was released. Osamu Ito, Development Supervisor of the R31/32 Skyline, was assigned to redesign the Laurel. He saw the car needed significant changes, and set about doing so. Some of the Laurel's new features included a 4-door sedan body, variations in the hardtop, an angular design (including a strong push), and the world's first electric retractable door mirrors. The RB20E engine was equipped with six-cylinder series SOHC2.0L, VG20ET-SOHC2.0L V6 turbo, CA18S-series four-cylinder (LPG and specifications), LD28-series 6-cylinder diesel SOHC2.8L. The car's system also integrated a C32 steering rack and adopted a rack-and-pinion type. In May 1985, the Grand Extra Limited edition was released. Detail improvements were made in October 1985 and January 1986. In October 1986 there were mechanical changes along with significant modifications to the exterior. There was a new turbocharged DOHC engine, the 2.0-liter RB20DET 24-valve six-cylinder, while the LD28 diesel engine was replaced by the new RD28-series six-cylinder diesel engine. In May 1987 the \\"Grande Extra White Special\\" edition was release. In August of the same year, the Grande Touring Limited was added to lineup. In February 1988 there was an improved and some 20 releases Super medalist anniversary special edition. In May 1988, the \\"White Limited\\" model was released. In September of the same year, the Super Series Selection was added to the lineup. In December private car and driving school versions were discontinued, leaving only taxis and other commercial models. In January 1989 Laurels with an automatic gearbox received a shift lock. The taxi/commercial versions of the fifth generation were finally discontinued in July 1993, when they were replaced by the Nissan Crew. Rear view of fifth generation Laurel Nissan Laurel HardTop Medalist  Sixth generation (C33) (1989‚Äì1993)  In December 1988, the C33 Laurel was announced. A month later, in January 1989, the C33 went on sale, originally only available as a hardtop four-door. The base engine offering again was a 1.8-litre four, the available options consisted of a 2-litre six (SOHC, DOHC or DOHC Turbo) and a 2.8-litre diesel inline-six. Early in 1991 a DOHC 2.5-litre inline-six coupled to a five-speed automatic became available. Nissan Laurel Medalist in Japan The Nissan Laurel used a rear-wheel drive layout, making it a popular car to modify for drifting use. The C33 in particular is very popular as a drift car, because it has the same floor plan as the Nissan A31 Cefiro and the four-door Nissan Skyline R32. They also have many interchangeable parts which makes them ideal for modification. Suspension parts are identical to the Nissan Silvia S13 model. The Toyota competitor was the Cresta, and there was also the new Honda Inspire in the same segment. The Laurel was repositioned slightly higher as a larger luxury sedan, as its exterior dimensions matched with the Nissan Cedric and Nissan Gloria which were exclusive to separate Japanese Nissan dealerships (Nissan Bluebird for the Cedric, Nissan Prince for the Gloria). The Laurel still remained the junior sedan to the Nissan flagship Nissan President which was all new in 1989, and remained exclusive to Japanese dealership Nissan Motor Store locations. Trim levels included the Medalist, Medalist Club S and Gran Limited. The Club S was the only C33 laurel with the RB25DE option and a front lip spoiler, with other models offering only the RB20, CA18 and RD28 engines. V6 engines were no longer available; instead, the RB20E type (SOHC), RB20DE type (DOHC), RB20DET type (single turbo DOHC) series 6-cylinder 2.0L, CA18i series four-cylinder SOHC1.8L and RD28-series six-cylinder diesel engines were offered. In addition to this, the improved HICAS-II suspension configuration was used. Four-cylinder model (CA18i) series and six-cylinder diesel engine (RD28) in the presence and instruction car specifications. On January 1991, the Laurel was facelifted and a new RB20E/RB20DE-powered 5-speed AT model crept into the range. Also in November 1991, 3-series cars RB25DE Catalogue DOHC2.5L add a grade-six-cylinder engine. 2.5L existing and additional models equipped with previous generations high mount side lamp, side door airbags. Organizing models in the senior grades. In the North American market, this was only sold in parts of the Caribbean, primarily the Bahamas under the Nissan Laurel Altima. However, the Altima name was first used in the United States & Canada starting in the 1993 model year for its new compact car, which has since become a mid-size in 2002. By January 1992 cumulative production achieved 2 million units.  Seventh generation (C34) (1993‚Äì1997)  The Laurel C34 was no longer available in hardtop sedan configuration; the single body style offered was the regular saloon with B-posts. Gone as well was the four-cylinder engine. Available engines included a 2.0 L six (SOHC or DOHC), a 2.5 L DOHC six and a 2.8 L diesel six. Some of the later models featured more sophistication such as Nissan's proprietary 4-wheel steering (HICAS) and 4-wheel drive (ATTESA) systems, which were based on the Skyline models. The Toyota competitor was the Cresta and the Honda Inspire. This was the first series that was no longer regarded as a compact sedan under Japanese vehicle classification regulations due to the engine displacement exceeding 2000 cc, and vehicle length and width were no longer in compliance. Japanese owners were now liable for additional taxes paid yearly in addition to standard registration, road tax, and inspection costs. January 1993 the C34-facelift released.

The minor change to the late-C34 has been changed significantly from the initially unpopular exterior design of the type.  Eighth generation (C35) (1997‚Äì2002)  Nissan Laurel in Japan The eighth and last generation debuted in June 1997. The number of available models was further reduced; the models had a DOHC two- liter engine, a 2.5 L six, or a 2.8 L diesel six. In late 2002 Laurel production was ended. The competitors were the Toyota Cresta and the Honda Inspire. In this generation, no manual transmission was offered anymore. June 1997 The C35-facelift.

Hastinapur, described in Hindu texts such as the Mahabharata and the Puranas as the capital of the Kuru Kingdom, is also mentioned in ancient Jain texts. Hastinapur is located on the right bank of the Ganges river. Etymology In Sanskrit, Hastinapur translates to 'the City of Elephants' from Hastina (elephant) and puram (city). Its history dates back to the period of Mahabharata. Several claims suggest that the city was named after King Hasti. Hastinapur has also been known by other names, such as Gajapuram, Nagapura, Asandivata, Brahmasthalam, Shanti Nagaram and Kunjarpuram, in different ancient texts. It is also mentioned in the Ramayana (2:68), the 13th and 14th verses of which say (translated): History Balarama pulling Hastinapur toward the Ganges, a page from a \\"Bhagavata Dasamskanda\\" series. Yudhisthira arrives in Hastinapur at the end of Kurukshetra War in the epic Mahabharata. In the Mahabharata, Hastinapur is portrayed as the capital of the Kuru Kingdom of the Kauravas. Many incidents in the Mahabharata were set in the city of Hastinapur. According to the Mahabharata, the 100 Kaurava brothers were born in this city to their mother, Queen Gandhari, the wife of King Dhritarashtra. On the bank of the Budhi Ganga, two places near Hastinapur (Draupadi Ghat and Karna Ghat) reference Mahabharata personages. The first reference to Hastinapur in the Puranas presents the city as the capital of Emperor Bharata's kingdom. King Samprati (also referred to as Samrat Samprati), grandson of the emperor Asoka the Great of the Mauryan Empire, built many temples here during his reign. Excavations at Hastinapur were carried out in the early 1950s by B.B. Lal, Director General of the Archaeological Survey of India. Although the main aim of this excavation, according to Lal himself, was to determine the stratigraphic position of Painted Grey Ware concerning other known ceramic industries of the early historical period, Lal found correlations between the text of the Mahabharata and the material remains that he unearthed at Hastinapur. This led him to historicize some of the traditions mentioned in the Mahabharata as well as link the appearance of the Painted Grey Ware with Aryans in the upper Ganges basin areas.

Places of interest Located on the banks of an old ravine of the Ganges, Hastinapur is considered one of the holiest places for both Hindus and Jains alike. It is believed to be the birthplace of three Jain Tirthankaras. There are many ancient Hindu temples including Pandeshwar Temple and Karna Temple, as well as Jain temples, such as Shri Digamber, Jain Mandir, Jambudweep, Kailash Parvat, and Shwetambar Jain Temple. =Temples and monuments= Shri Digamber Jain Prachin Bada Mandir Pracheen Bada Mandir Shri Digamber Jain Bada Mandir is one of the oldest Jain temples in Hastinapur.

The first novel in the series to be published was Deryni Rising in 1970, and the most recent, The King's Deryni, was published in 2014. As of 2016, the series consists of five trilogies, one stand-alone novel, various short stories, and two reference books. Most of the series is set in the land of Gwynedd, one of the fictional Eleven Kingdoms (portions of King Kelson's Bride take place in the rival kingdom of Torenth). Gwynedd itself is a medieval kingdom that roughly parallels 10th-, 11th-, and 12th- century England, Scotland, and Wales with a powerful Holy Church (based on the Roman Catholic Church), and a feudal government ruled by a hereditary monarchy. The population of the Eleven Kingdoms includes both humans and Deryni, a race of people with inherent psychic and magical abilities. Throughout the course of the series, relations between humans and Deryni result in ongoing political and religious strife that is often interconnected with the individual lives of the main characters. While the plots of the novels often involve political, ecclesiastical, and military conflicts on a grand scale, they are counterbalanced by details of the characters' personal lives. Neither race is depicted as inherently \\"good\\" nor \\"evil\\", as both humans and Deryni are depicted as protagonists and antagonists at various points of the series. Additionally, the novels often depict the characters engaging in various forms of magic, and such scenes vary in importance from minor events to significant plot points. Novels The five Deryni trilogies were published in an order which does not match the internal literary chronology of the series. The first four trilogies alternated between the 12th and 10th centuries, while the fifth trilogy is set immediately prior to the events of the first trilogy. The stand-alone novel, King Kelson's Bride, takes place after the third trilogy. The trilogies are briefly listed by publication date below, with a more detailed listing after. *Publication order **The Chronicles of the Deryni **The Legends of Camber of Culdi **The Histories of King Kelson **The Heirs of Saint Camber **King Kelson's Bride **The Childe Morgan Trilogy *Historical order: **The Legends of Camber of Culdi **The Heirs of Saint Camber **The Childe Morgan Trilogy **The Chronicles of the Deryni **The Histories of King Kelson **King Kelson's Bride =The Chronicles of the Deryni= *Deryni Rising (1970) **November 1120: Kelson Haldane must protect his crown from a Deryni usurper. *Deryni Checkmate (1972) **March 1121: Alaric Morgan and Duncan McLain face the wrath of the Holy Church. *High Deryni (1973) **June 1121 ‚Äì July 1121: Kelson Haldane attempts to repair an ecclesiastical schism on the eve of a foreign invasion. =The Legends of Camber of Culdi= *Camber of Culdi (1976) **September 903 ‚Äì December 904: The events that inspired Camber MacRorie to lead the Haldane Restoration. *Saint Camber (1978) **June 905 ‚Äì January 907: The struggles of Camber MacRorie to protect the throne of Cinhil Haldane. *Camber the Heretic (1981) **January 917 ‚Äì January 918: An anti-Deryni backlash sweeps through Gwynedd, threatening the lives of every Deryni in the kingdom. =The Histories of King Kelson= *The Bishop's Heir (1984) **November 1123 ‚Äì January 1124: An old political conflict threatens to erupt once again. *The King's Justice (1985) **May 1124 ‚Äì July 1124: Kelson Haldane leads a military campaign to put down a rebellion *The Quest for Saint Camber (1986) **March 1125 ‚Äì June 1125: A tragic accident befalls Kelson Haldane during a religious quest. =The Heirs of Saint Camber= *The Harrowing of Gwynedd (1989) **January 918 ‚Äì August 918: The Deryni desperately try to survive the persecutions. *King Javan's Year (1992) **June 921 ‚Äì October 922: Javan Haldane struggles to secure his throne. *The Bastard Prince (1994) **May 928 ‚Äì December 928: Rhys Michael Haldane must defend his crown from a foreign invader. =The Childe Morgan Trilogy= *In the King's Service (2003) **Summer 1082 ‚Äì November 1091: Donal Blaine Haldane seeks a Deryni protector for his sons. *Childe Morgan (2006) **December 1093 - March 1096: Kenneth and Alyce Morgan prepare their son Alaric for his future role. *The King's Deryni (December 2, 2014) **January 1099 - November 1106: A young Alaric Morgan grows up at court under the protection and friendship of King Brion Haldane. =Other novels= *King Kelson's Bride (2000) **June 1128 ‚Äì August 1128: Kelson Haldane faces the plots and intrigues of the Torenthi royal court.

He is best remembered for hosting the BBC's popular series The Generation Game and for his high camp and English music hall humour. His camp stand-up act consisted mainly of anecdotes about a cast of imaginary friends; the most frequently mentioned were Everard and Slack Alice. He is often cited as one of the first gay entertainers to have enjoyed mass appeal, although he never made any reference to his sexuality. He was devoted to his adopted home town of Nuneaton, where a museum display relating to his life and work and a memorial have been established. Biography Grayson was born William Sulley White in Banbury, Oxfordshire, in 1923. His parents were unmarried and he never met his father. When Grayson was ten days old, his mother, Ethel White, arranged for him to be adopted by Alice and Jim Hammonds in Nuneaton, Warwickshire. He had two adoptive sisters, Flo and May. His adoptive mother Alice died when he was six years old, and he was brought up by his elder adoptive sister, Flo, with whom he lived for much of his life. It has been reported that his birth mother stayed in touch with the family and was known to Grayson as \\"Aunt Ethel\\", until he discovered her true identity when he was 8 years old. Early career Grayson left school at the age of 14 and began working professionally as a supporting drag act on the comedy club circuit. He initially used the stage-name Billy Breen, but changed it to Larry Grayson in the 1950s on the advice of his agent.Anthony Hayward \\"Obituary: Larry Grayson\\", The Independent, 9 January 1995 BBC TV's The One Show reported on 27 November 2012 that the name \\"Grayson\\" was taken from the American singer Kathryn Grayson, but the origin of the name \\"Larry\\" is unknown. Regent Cinema, Redcar, where Larry coined his catchphrase,\\"Shut that door!\\" Over the next 30 years he toured the UK in male revues and drag shows, as well as in variety shows at venues including working men's clubs, regional theatres and the Metropolitan in London. He also added stand-up comedy to his act and developed a unique and very gentle anecdotal style of comedy. It was usually based around his various imaginary friends such as Everard, Apricot Lil, Slack Alice and the postman Pop-It-In Pete. A lot of his material was observational. In his early years, Grayson's family had the only telephone in the street, and his inspiration came from overhearing his neighbours using it. The \\"imaginary friends\\" were in fact based on local characters: for example, Apricot Lil worked at the local jam factory.\\"Seems Like a Nice Boy!\\", Mike Malyon, 2016 It was while he performed as Billy Breen at the New Pavilion Theatre Redcar (now the Regent Cinema) that he started using his familiar catchphrase \\"shut that door\\" when a side door had been left open causing a cold breeze to blow across the stage straight from the sea. During this period, Grayson was briefly managed by Eve Taylor, who renamed him 'Larry Grayson' and she is credited with being the source of the phrase, as several of her clients revealed that whenever she wanted to discuss money or personal issues with her clients, she would always tell them to \\"shut that door\\". Taylor struggled to find him the right opportunities and they parted, with Grayson becoming a client of Michael Grade. Television career An early TV appearance in the 1950s had led to complaints about his act being too outrageous, and Grayson had resigned himself to a career off television. Then in the early 1970s his club act was seen by Michael Grade, then an agent, who quickly signed him. Following several successful appearances in ATV variety shows, Grade's uncle, impresario Lew Grade gave Grayson a contract to front a show, Shut That Door! (1972), and slightly later, the Larry Grayson Show. In 1974 he released the Single ' Am I Just a Pretty Face ' , on Pye Records. Grayson also made two cameo appearances in the Midlands-based soap opera Crossroads, as a flouncing, difficult customer at the Crossroads Motel and as the chauffeur at the wedding of Meg Richardson, played by his close friend Noele Gordon. In real life Grayson could not drive. He also made a number of guest appearances in variety shows, chat shows and panel games. =The Generation Game= Grayson's popularity peaked when he was hired by the BBC to present the Saturday night show The Generation Game in 1978, as replacement for Bruce Forsyth. The show became hugely successful, attracting audiences of 25 million at its peak. Grayson was assisted by his co-star Isla St Clair, whom he frequently referred to as \\"my lovely Isla\\". Despite its huge popularity, by 1981 The Generation Game was being overtaken in the ratings by ITV's rival show Game for a Laugh. Grayson decided to leave The Generation Game in 1982 while it was still relatively successful, in the expectation that the BBC would offer him another high- profile Saturday night show; this did not materialise. Later life Because offers of work were not forthcoming, Grayson went into unintentional semi- retirement, enjoying time on his own at his house in Nuneaton with his beloved dogs, although he did return to television to present the game show Sweethearts for ITV in 1987. He made a number of other TV appearances and radio broadcasts, especially on the Tom O'Connor hosted TV quiz show A Question of Entertainment, where he was one of the team captains in 1988. Grayson moved with Flo (his adoptive older sister) to Torquay, Devon, as part of his semi-retirement, but moved back to Nuneaton after just a couple of years when he became bored and missed his close family and friends. They lived in two separate neighbouring bungalows. Death Grayson's final public appearance was on 3 December 1994 at the Royal Variety Performance. During this performance he referred to his hiatus from television by commenting to the audience, \\"They thought I was dead!\\". On New Year's Eve 1994, Grayson was rushed into hospital. He was found to have suffered from a perforated appendix. After being allowed home from hospital, Grayson died on 7 January 1995 in Nuneaton, at the age of 71. His body was buried alongside other members of his family at Oaston Road Cemetery in his home town of Nuneaton. =Obituaries= Journalist Suzi Pritchard wrote in The Guardian: > \\"His camp, deliciously naughty humour was never crude or vulgar. The gentle > ambivalence of his humour made him attractive to an extraordinarily diverse > range of people. But his real appeal was that of a valued neighbour > perceptively observing the details of everyday life and commenting on it > across the garden fence, creating an emotional intimacy in a society > starting to fragment.\\" Ken Dodd, comedian, said of Grayson's appeal and warmth: > \\"He loved everybody and he wanted them to love him in return and yes, they > did, they all loved Larry\\".

Resident in Ireland for over twenty years, she now lives in Virginia. Personal life Kurtz was born October 18, 1944 in Coral Gables, Florida, where she also grew up. She secured a scholarship to study chemistry and graduated with a B.S. in chemistry from the University of Miami. She married Scott MacMillan in 1983; they have one son. Within the following couple of years they moved to Ireland. Both later became naturalized Irish citizens. Until 2007, they lived at Holybrooke (Hollybrook) Hall, in the largest of four houses formed from the original historic building, between Kilmacanogue and Bray in County Wicklow, Ireland. Kurtz wrote, and Macmillan, who had worked in the film industry, took a role as a herald in the Office of the Chief Herald of Ireland. They put their Irish home on the market in 2006 for 3.5 million euro, moving back to the United States in 2007, to an historic house in Virginia. Writing career Kurtz is best known for the Deryni novels and short stories. Her 1970 debut novel, Deryni Rising, was one of the first fantasy novels written in a mode closer to historical fiction than to mythology or legend, as was common in the then-popular high fantasy works such as those by J. R. R. Tolkien. Writing in Strange Horizons, Kari Sperring calls Kurtz the \\"first writer of secondary-world historical fantasy\\", noting her close attention to the importance of faith in pre-modern Western societies and her portrayal of magic as a formal, ritual practice as opposed to the \\"picaresque and informal\\" way magic was depicted in other fantasy of the time. She also wrote several occult alternate history novels in her Templar series, and urban fantasy novels in her Adept series. Katherine has a weekly chat with her fan base about her writing, life, cats, and many other subjects. The chat is held every Sunday evening around 7 p.m. US Eastern Time, except for the first Sunday of the month when it is usually held two hours earlier for the European fans to chat at an earlier time.

The political, social, and religious conflicts that surround the Deryni, particularly in the Kingdom of Gwynedd, often serve as major plot points throughout the novels. Deryni powers The novels include various examples of inherent Deryni abilities that are displayed by numerous primary and secondary characters. Deryni powers are closely interconnected with each other, since a Deryni's natural psychic abilities also give him/her the ability to perform magical rituals of varying complexity, but many of these powers can be divided into three basic categories: psychic abilities, magical abilities, and Healing. =Psychic abilities= *Memory manipulation: The ability to retrieve, alter, block, or erase specific memories, either in the Deryni's own mind or in the mind of someone else. *Mind-Seeing: The ability to completely enter a subject's mind, thus viewing the subject's memories, emotions, reasoning, and intellect. *Shields: Occasionally described as the foundation upon which the rest of the Deryni powers are built, shields are mental barriers that a Deryni erects around his/her mind to protect it from attack or intrusion. The strength of a Deryni's shields is often a combination of his/her natural strength and the quality of their training. *Telekinesis: The ability to manipulate small objects with only the power of the mind, such as moving the tumblers of a lock, igniting a torch, or altering the flight of an arrow. *Telepathy: The ability to communicate mentally, including the power to share large amounts of information in a very brief period of time. *Truth- Reading: The ability to detect an intentional spoken lie. This power only reveals the presence of the falsehood, not the specific truth that is being concealed. *Truth-Saying: The ability to force a subject to truthfully answer any question to the best of his/her abilities. =Magical abilities= *Minor spells: Trained Deryni are often capable of performing basic spells, such as spells to calm the mind, focus the mind, or temporarily relieve fatigue. *Major spells: Those Deryni powerful enough to work more complex spells can perform feats such as manipulating the weather, changing their physical appearance, creating illusions, or summoning and controlling fire, water, or lightning. *Ritual magic: Skilled Deryni adepts are capable of performing complex arcane rituals designed to accomplish a wide variety of effects. Such rituals often involve a great deal of magical power and can be quite dangerous to the untrained practitioner. *Transfer Portals: A Portal is an artificially- created nexus of arcane power that is set in stone or earth. Deryni have the ability to access the nexus and use its energy to instantly transport themselves to other nexuses in other locations. Each Portal has its own unique energy signature (or coordinates), so a Deryni must be familiar with the coordinates of his/her intended destination to be able to use a Portal. (This is best accomplished in person, but it is also possible for highly skilled Deryni to read the coordinates of a Portal from the mind of another person.) =Healing= A small percentage of Deryni are born with the natural ability to heal physical injuries, a power that goes beyond merely setting broken bones or sewing wounds shut. A highly trained Healer can bring a seriously wounded patient back from the brink of death, repairing their injuries in a matter of minutes through a combination of arcane powers, extensive anatomical knowledge, and the innate ability to augment the wounded body's own natural recovery processes. Healers often study for years before completing their training, expanding their knowledge of the body and developing their own inner strength for the large amounts of energy that Healing requires. In the Kingdom of Gwynedd, the knowledge to identify and train Healers is lost soon after the Haldane Restoration in the early tenth century. For over two centuries, Healers effectively cease to exist in Gwynedd, until the lost Healing talent is rediscovered in the twelfth century by Duke Alaric Morgan of Corwyn. Blocking In 917, the Healer Rhys Thuryn accidentally discovers a new Healing talent while attempting to Heal Earl Gregory MacDinan of Ebor. While deeply immersed in a Healing trance, Rhys successfully blocks all of Earl Gregory's Deryni powers. After further research, Rhys discovers that he is capable of blocking the powers of any Deryni with a simple touch, regardless of the strength of his subject. While their powers are blocked, these Deryni subjects function as normal humans, displaying absolutely no signs of any arcane abilities. Although Rhys attempts several times to teach this talent to other Healers, his efforts ultimately fail, and it is determined that the ability to block is as rare to Healers as Healers themselves are to the general Deryni population. Later research indicates that the Deryni masters of the past were aware of this ability, but knowledge of its existence became lost over time. While a few Healers are later found to possess this ability, knowledge of its existence once again disappears when the rest of the Healing arts are lost in Gwynedd. Genetic basis of Deryni powers The basic ability to naturally develop Deryni powers is hereditary in nature, passing from parent to child and thus from generation to generation. Although several characters in the novels refer to Deryni-nonDeryni hybrids as \\"half-breeds\\" or \\"half-Deryni,\\" the inherent nature of Deryni powers enables them to be passed to a child even if only one parent is Deryni. (Throughout the novels and ancillary material, nonDeryni humans are referred to simply as \\"humans,\\" although it is unspecified whether this exclusionary terminology was originally positive or negative.) However, the natural strength of the Deryni bloodline tends to become weakened if succeeding generations continue to breed with full-blooded humans. The exact rate of this genetic \\"dilution\\" is not specified, and several half-Deryni characters (such as Alaric Morgan and Duncan McLain) display significant levels of arcane strength. An appendix to one of the early books speculates that the usual Deryni powers are carried on the X-chromosome (thus explaining why Morgan and Duncan, who have Deryni mothers, can have full powers), while the \\"Haldane potential\\" (also seen in several other families), is carried on the Y-chromosome. However, this is not borne out by later genealogies and seems to have been dropped as an explanation by Katherine Kurtz. In addition to their genetic basis, most Deryni abilities must be trained and developed. While basic arcane skills can be often be mastered during adolescence, more complex abilities and talents may require constant study and practice throughout the adult life of a Deryni. Deryni adepts such as Camber MacRorie and Wencit Furst√°n of Torenth continue their arcane studies throughout their lives, enabling them to wield powers far beyond the abilities of many of their contemporaries. Conversely, Queen Jehana of Gwynedd, a full-blooded Deryni from an ancient and powerful lineage, is barely able to perform the most basic of Deryni talents, due to her lack of training throughout much of her life. Regardless of the inherent strength of a Deryni's natural powers, proper training is essential for those powers to be of any practical use. It should also be noted that the use of the Deryni powers generally requires some degree of mental concentration and is physically tiring to perform. The need for concentration is key to the drama of the battle that ends in Duncan's capture in 'The King's Justice, as well as his rescue later in the same book. Alaric Morgan is frequently shown pushing himself to the point of exhaustion and collapse by the repeated use of his powers in short periods of time, generally when driven by the demands of events. These facts, together with the training requirement, impose realistic limits on Deryni magic. The Haldane potential In 903, Earl Camber MacRorie of Culdi theorizes that certain humans possess the natural ability to be invested with the full range of Deryni powers. Camber develops a magical ritual to perform this feat and utilizes Cinhil I Haldane as his subject, believing that the Haldane prince would need such powers to overthrow King Imre Festil-Furst√°n and reclaim the throne of Gwynedd. The ritual is successful, and Cinhil later uses his newly acquired powers to accomplish the Haldane Restoration. Although later research indicates that the Deryni masters of the past were aware of this possibility, Cinhil is the first known human to acquire Deryni abilities. While other humans are later shown to acquire such powers, this human ability to wield Deryni powers becomes known as \\"the Haldane potential.\\" Similar to natural Deryni powers, it is hereditary within the Haldane line. However, unlike Deryni powers, the Haldane powers require no training. Once the powers are activated (usually through a magical ritual), they are fully accessible, as the knowledge of how to use them is automatically included with the powers themselves. In general, the reigning Haldane king sets the potential in his heir at a young age (using a ritual he designs), leaving the heir's powers dormant until he ascends the throne himself. A second ritual (distinct from the coronation) fully activates the potential in the new monarch. Various forms of these rituals have been depicted in the novels, and they may or may not include the participation of other people. It is thought that the ritual variations serve to prevent other Haldanes or other Deryni from usurping the powers and the throne itself. To date, all of the Haldane kings specifically depicted in the novels have wielded at least some of the Haldane powers. However, whether or not any of the other Haldane kings had their hereditary powers activated is unknown. During the two centuries of Deryni persecution in Gwynedd, the Haldane kings justify their arcane powers by claiming that such powers are part of their Divine Right, a sign that they have been chosen by God to sit upon the throne. For much of this time, it is also believed (specifically by the Camberian Council) that only one Haldane can wield the power at a time, and that right is reserved for the reigning king. However, this belief is disproved during the reign of King Kelson Haldane, when several members of his immediate family hold varying levels of arcane power at the same time. Deryni status in society Deryni have been a minority within the larger population throughout the history of Gwynedd. The novels have established very little specific information about the exact status of Deryni or their place in Gwyneddan society prior to the Festillic Coup of 822, but they clearly rise to prominence following the successful invasion of Festil I Furst√°n, a younger prince of the Deryni ruling house of the Kingdom of Torenth. During the eight decades that follow, most of the positions of power in Gwynedd (both secular and ecclesiastical) are held by Deryni. Although there are numerous humans who still manage to rise to positions of influence, many Deryni clearly enjoy privileged status simply because of their race. Human resentment toward the ruling minority is one of the factors that eventually leads to the Haldane Restoration in 904. Following the return of the Haldanes to the throne of Gwynedd, a backlash against Deryni soon begins to manifest itself throughout Gwyneddan society. Shortly after the death of King Cinhil I Haldane in 917, a violent explosion of anti-Deryni fervor sweeps through the kingdom, fueled by the human lords and bishops who now control both the Crown and the Church. Over the next two centuries, the number of Deryni in Gwynedd shrinks dramatically, as many Deryni flee the realm to escape the dangerous persecutions. Those who remain are stripped of most of their legal rights, and forbidden to use their powers by a Church that declares them to be evil heretics. By contrast, Deryni are openly accepted and respected in the neighboring Kingdom of Torenth. The royal family of Torenth is not only Deryni, but they are acknowledged as being among the most powerful and highly trained Deryni adepts in the Eleven Kingdoms. As a result, Deryni are an integral and established part of all aspects of Torenthi society. The differences between the social standing of Deryni in Gwynedd and Torenth are one of the factors that has contributed to the constant state of antagonism between the two lands. To date, the status of Deryni in the other realms of the Eleven Kingdoms has not been clearly established. Deryni as characters Many of the novels are set specifically in Gwynedd, and deal with the efforts of Deryni to reclaim a position of social equality for their race. As a result, many of the Deryni are depicted as protagonists. However, there are also several notable Deryni that plainly serve as antagonists in the novels, displaying motivations and actions that establish or complement the main conflict. Similarly, human characters are depicted as both antagonists and protagonists, further underlying the theme that the characters in the novels are neither \\"good\\" nor \\"evil\\" simply based on their race. Regardless of whether the character is human, Deryni, or a mixture of both, it is ultimately his/her unique personality and history that determines their actions. This theme is a recurring motif throughout the novels.

She was named for Sonoma Creek in northern California, Sonoma County, California, and the town of Sonoma, California, that in turn were named for one of the chiefs of the Chocuyen Indians of that region. Sonoma was launched by the Portsmouth Navy Yard at Kittery, Maine, on 15 April 1862; sponsored by Miss Mary N. Bleecker; and commissioned on 8 July 1862, Commander Thomas H. Stevens, Jr. in command. Service history =1862-1863= On 17 July 1862, the double-ender sailed for the West Indies for operations against Confederate blockade runners and raiders on the high seas. The success of Confederate cruisers, especially and , in operations against Union shipping prompted the Department of the Navy on 8 September 1862 to put Commodore Charles Wilkes in command of a \\"flying\\" West India Squadron created specifically to seek out and destroy the Confederate raiders. Sonoma was assigned to this squadron. While Sonoma never engaged Florida or Alabama, she did operate successfully against blockade runners. On 5 October 1862, Sonoma chased Harriet Pinckney back into port after she had attempted to slip out of Bermuda reportedly carrying \\"infernal machines or torpedoes ... for destroying ships in harbor.\\" On 18 January 1863, Sonoma and the sloop-of-war seized Virginia off Mugeres Island, Mexico, and sent the steamer to Key West, Florida, for adjudication. On 3 February 1863, Sonoma captured the British bark Springbok. On 15 February 1863, she took the brig Atlantic bound from Havana, Cuba, for Matamoros, Mexico. Finally, on 14 April 1863, she took the schooner Clyde in the Gulf of Mexico after Clyde had escaped from the Confederacy laden with cotton and rosin. The wear and tear of hard service at sea was catching up with Sonoma, and she sailed north for repairs. The ship reached New York City on 13 June 1863 and was decommissioned on 20 June 1863. =1863-1865= With repairs completed, Sonoma was recommissioned on 28 September 1863 and assigned to the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron in which she served for the rest of the Civil War. Highlights of this service included her capture on 8 July 1864 of Ida a sidewheel steamer which had slipped out of Sapelp Sound, Georgia, and was bound for the Bahamas laden with cotton. In December 1864, Sonoma was part of a Union naval force that landed Union Army troops and a battalion of United States Marines at Gregorie Point near Yemassee, South Carolina, in an attempt to cut the rail line between Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina; they were defeated by a significantly smaller Confederate force in the Battle of Tulifinny. Early in 1865, Sonoma participated in operations of the squadron clearing the way for General William Tecumseh Sherman in his march north from Savannah. On 9 February 1865, Sonoma, the sloop-of-war , and the sidewheel steamer engaged Confederate batteries at Togodo Creek, near North Edisto, South Carolina. Sonoma was hit twice in the action, but she silenced the Confederate guns. On the same day, Sherman was marching on nearby Orangeburg, South Carolina, which he took on 12 February 1865. Assurance of Union naval control of the waters in its path enabled Sherman's army to travel fast and light and helped to shorten the war. On 16 and 17 February 1865, Sonoma joined in the naval support of the Union Armys attack on Bull's Bay, South Carolina, a diversionary movement in the major drive on Charleston. A boat party from the ship helped in the fighting ashore. The tempo of Sonomas activity eased somewhat as Sherman moved north close to territory whose waters were within the jurisdiction of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, but she and her sister ships remained as visible evidence of Union power. After the Confederacy collapsed in April 1865, the ship sailed north and was decommissioned at New York City on 13 June 1865. She was sold there on 1 October 1867.

Dick, first published in 1956. Although one of Dick's lesser-known novels, it features several of the ideas and themes that recur throughout his later works. The \\"jape[s]\\" or practical jokes of the novel begin with a statue's unconventional decapitation. The Man Who Japed was first published by Ace Books as one half of Ace Double D-193, bound dos-√†-dos with The Space Born by E. C. Tubb.  Plot introduction  The Man Who Japed is set in the year 2114. After a devastating twentieth century limited nuclear war, a South African (\\"Afrikaans Empire\\") military survivor named General Streiter launched a global revolution in 1985 that ushered in a totalitarian government. In one example of the carnage Dick has his protagonist Allen Purcell visit Japan's northern island, Hokkaid≈ç. The location is still a desolate wasteland that has not recovered from nuclear bombardment in 1972, the last year of the global war referred to within this book. This regime - Moral Reclamation (\\"Morec\\") - rules a post-apocalyptic world under its strict ideology. One of Streiter's lineal descendants, Ida Pease Hoyt, is in charge. Morec has created an ultra- conservative and puritanical society that is oppressive and judgmental of its fellow citizens. Punishable offenses include mild public cursing, kissing a non-spouse, absenteeism from community meetings and the commercial display of neon signs. A thriving black market exists, however, where one can purchase the Decameron, James Joyce's Ulysses, chablis wine and pulp fiction detective novels from the twentieth century. Earth people also occupy several other planetary systems. There are human colonies on Bellatrix (Gamma Orionis), Sirius 8 and 9, and \\"Orionus.\\" On these worlds, intensive labour is required to provide agricultural and industrial products for survival. One of the planets is used as a \\"Refuge\\" for the rehabilitation of social misfits or \\"nooses\\". The \\"japery\\" alluded to in the title is Allen Purcell's wanton destruction of a statue of General Streiter. But Purcell has only vague, distorted and disjointed memories of the act and doesn't understand his own motivation for doing it. He is up for an appointment to a high-level position as a guardian of public ethics. Purcell later intentionally concocts a history of General Streiter for a live televised broadcast that falsely claims Streiter had a policy of having his enemies butchered and served as meals to his family and himself. Hoyt is accused of continuing the practice of cannibalism. Purcell and his wife are about to escape Morec justice when he has a change of heart and decides to remain on Earth and face the consequences of his crime. He promises his wife a trip to friend Myron Mavis's planet when they both make it through to \\"the other side\\" of their punishment. Reception Anthony Boucher dismissed the novel as a \\"hasty and disappointing\\" effort.\\"Recommended Reading,\\" F&SF;, July 1957, p.93.

History of the phrase Schwarzenegger borrowed the term from a series of Saturday Night Live sketches in which Dana Carvey and Kevin Nealon played bodybuilders named Hans and Franz, large men with Austrian accents. The two characters, for comic reasons, were characterized as cousins of Schwarzenegger.Saturday Night Live clip on www.schwarzenegger.com Schwarzenegger's usage The term was first used by Schwarzenegger in the 1988 presidential election, accompanied by then Vice President George H.W. Bush. He was shown attacking Bush's opponents: \\"They all look like a bunch of girlie men, right?\\" He repeated it in the 1992 election, then campaigning for President Bush, again applying it to the Democratic candidates, as seen in the 1992 documentary Feed by Kevin Rafferty and James Ridgeway. He used the phrase again on July 17, 2004: \\"If they don't have the guts to come up here in front of you and say, 'I don't want to represent you, I want to represent those special interests, the unions, the trial lawyers ... ' if they don't have the guts, I call them girlie men.\\" He would use the term twice in the speech. Schwarzenegger would later use the term again at the 2004 Republican National Convention, where he implored the audience not to be pessimistic about the economy, saying \\"Don't be economic girlie men.\\" Transcript of address at the 2004 Republican National Convention. Schwarzenegger was criticized by various gay rights and feminist groups. California State Senator Sheila Kuehl, who is a member of the legislature's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Caucus, claimed that the governor had resorted to \\"blatant homophobia\\", stating that the phrase \\"uses an image that is associated with gay men in an insulting way, and it was supposed to be an insult. That's very troubling that he would use such a homophobic way of trying to put down legislative leadership.\\"Democrats: Schwarzenegger Comment Sexist - Common Dreams by Tim Molloy Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez, said he was not upset by the remark but that his 13-year-old daughter was. \\"She's a young girl who knows the governor and really likes him a lot and didn't find the term to be a positive term, and finds it to be derogatory,\\" Nunez said. \\"It was no question a very, very insensitive comment to make. I personally am not intimidated or threatened by it, but I think it really is beneath Gov. Schwarzenegger.\\"Schwarzenegger calls Dems 'girlie men' China Daily, 2004-07-19 08:46Democrats say Schwarzenegger 'girlie-men' Comment Sexist, homophobic By Tim Molloy, AP, news.google.com copy Jeff Bissiri, the Log Cabin Republicans' California Director, defended Schwarzenegger, responding to Kuehl's statements by stating that \\"the Governor's use of the term 'girlie man' was not a slur aimed at the gay and lesbian community and Senator Kuehl knows that ... Where was her outrage when the Bustamante campaign referred to candidate Schwarzenegger as a 'sissy' for not agreeing to an endless series of debates?\\" =Regrets= In an October 2018 interview with Men's Health magazine, Schwarzenegger expressed regret for using the phrase: > At the time it felt like the right thing to do. It was in my gut. I > improvised it. I called them girlie men because they weren't willing to take > risks. They were afraid of everything. Politicians in general want to do > little things so there's no risk involved. But it was shortsighted. In the > long term, it's better to not say that, because you want to work with them. Other public uses The term, popularized initially by the Saturday Night Live sketch, received new life following Schwarzenegger's usage. New York Times opinion columnist Maureen Dowd quoted a Democratic insider who claimed that 2004 Presidential candidate John Kerry had \\"turned into a girlie man\\".FindLaw's Writ - Mcclain: The \\"Girlie Men\\" Slur and Similar Insults Hans and Franz, a bodybuilding duo on Saturday Night Live, often used the term to talk about \\"pathetic, flabby losers\\". This term has been carried over to the State Farm commercials. Jack Kemp, former Republican Congressman and Vice Presidential Nominee, used the phrase in criticizing Democratic economic policies in his column \\"Don't be economic girlie-men.\\"Jack Kemp, Conservative, Political News In the video game Get Medieval the barbarian character spoofs Schwarzenegger's voice and thick accent and refers to the hordes of opponents as \\"girliemonsters\\". Australian Minister for Finance, Mathias Cormann, who was born in German-speaking Belgium, used the phrase \\"economic girlie-man\\" to describe opposition leader Bill Shorten in 2014. The phrase had previously been used on the comedy program Shaun Micallef's Mad as Hell by the fictitious \\"spokesman for Finance Minister, Darius Horsham\\", mocking Cormann's accent; since Cormann's use, the phrase has regularly appeared in skits featuring Horsham. Linguistic analysis In an article in the journal American Speech, linguist Edwin Battistella analyzes the development of the expression from ironic mockery of bodybuilding culture to an overt connotation of weakness and a covert connotation of effeminacy. He writes: > In all this usage, girly-man is implicitly contrasted with such terms as he- > man, macho-man, or manly man. These terms bring together images of physique, > strength, courage, and will in an image of comic-book manliness. The > controlling male stereotype is that of the muscular action-hero male as > manly and of other men (non‚Äìweight lifters, nonmacho straight men, gays) as > lacking courage, strength, and decisiveness. As critics of the usage pointed > out, referring to someone as a girly-man requires adopting this stereotype > as an instrument of either humor or derogation. And it further entails > adopting the complementary stereotype that women are not so strong or > decisive as men.Battistella, Edwin \\"Girly men and Girly girls,\\" American > Speech, Vol. 81, No. 1, Spring 2006 Contrasting the expression \\"girly girl\\" with \\"girly man,\\" Battistella suggests that in the former the adjective intensifies the stereotype present in the noun, while in the latter the adjective negates components of the stereotype to produce a range of derisive meanings.

It is on the list of largest banks in the United States and has developed a reputation for being a technology focused bank. The bank has 755 branches including 30 caf√© style locations and 2,000 ATMs. It is ranked 97th on the Fortune 500, 17th on Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For list, and conducts business in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The company helped pioneer the mass marketing of credit cards in the 1990s. In 2016, it was the 5th largest credit card issuer by purchase volume, after American Express, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup. With a market share of 5%, Capital One is also the second largest auto finance company in the United States, following Ally Financial. The company's three divisions are credit cards, consumer banking and commercial banking. In the fourth quarter of 2018, 75% of the company's revenues were from credit cards, 14% were from consumer banking, and 11% were from commercial banking. Capital One has consistently ranked as one of the best places to work for, appearing in multiple Glassdoor's Best Places To Work reports. In 2020, Fortune magazine ranked Capital One at number 24 on their Fortune List of the Top 100 Companies to Work For in 2020 based on an employee survey of satisfaction. History =Monoline credit card company (1994‚Äì2004)= Capital One retail footprint On July 27, 1994, Richmond, Virginia-based Signet Financial Corp (now part of Wells Fargo) announced the corporate spin-off of its credit card division, OakStone Financial, naming Richard Fairbank as CEO. Signet renamed the subsidiary Capital One in October 1994. At that time, Capital One was a monoline bank, meaning that all of its revenue came from a single product, in this case, credit cards. This strategy is risky in that it can lead to losses during bad times. Capital One attributed its relative success as a monoline to its use of data collection to build demographic profiles, allowing it to target personalized offers of credit directly to consumers. Capital One began operations in Canada in 1996. =Expansion into auto loans (1998‚Äìpresent)= Activities announcing the opening of the CapitalOne 360 Caf√© in Boston In July 1998, Capital One acquired auto financing company Summit Acceptance Corporation. In 1999, Capital One was looking to expand beyond credit cards. CEO Richard Fairbank announced moves to use Capital One's experience with collecting consumer data to offer loans, insurance, and phone service. In October 2001, PeopleFirst Finance LLC was acquired by Capital One. The companies were combined and re-branded as Capital One Auto Finance Corporation in 2003. In late 2002, Capital One and the United States Postal Service proposed a negotiated services agreement (NSA) for bulk discounts in mailing services. The resulting three-year agreement was extended in 2006. In June 2008, however, Capital One filed a complaint with the USPS regarding the terms of the next agreement, citing the terms of the NSA of Capital One's competitor, Bank of America. Capital One subsequently withdrew its complaint to the Postal Regulatory Commission following a settlement with the USPS. Onyx Acceptance Corporation was acquired by Capital One in January 2005. =Expansion into retail banking (2005‚Äìpresent)= While many other monolines were acquired by larger, diverse banks, Capital One expanded into retail banking with a focus on subprime customers. Capital One acquired New Orleans, Louisiana-based Hibernia National Bank for $4.9 billion in cash and stock in 2005 and acquired Melville, New York-based North Fork Bank for $13.2 billion in cash and stock in 2006, which reduced its dependency on credit cards from 90% to 55%. In 2007, Capital One acquired NetSpend, a marketer of prepaid debit cards, for $700 million. During the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis, Capital One closed its mortgage platform, GreenPoint Mortgage, due in part to investor pressures. In 2008, Capital One received an investment of $3.56 billion from the United States Treasury as a result of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. On June 17, 2009, Capital One completed the repurchase of the stock the company issued to the U.S. Treasury paying a total of $3.67 billion, resulting in a profit of over $100 million to the U.S. Treasury. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission criticized Capital One's conduct during the crisis, claiming that they understated auto loan losses during the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. In 2013, Capital One paid $3.5 million to settle the case, but was not required to directly address the allegations of wrongdoing. In February 2009, Capital One acquired Chevy Chase Bank for $520 million in cash and stock. In January 2011, Capital One acquired Canada-based Hudson's Bay Company's private credit card portfolio from Synchrony Financial, then known as GE Financial. In June 2011, ING Group announced the sale of its ING Direct division to Capital One for $9 billion in cash and stock. On August 26, 2011, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors announced it would hold public hearings on the Capital One acquisition of ING Direct, and extend to October 12, 2011, the public comment period that had been scheduled to end August 22. The move came amidst rising scrutiny of the deal on systemic risk, or \\"Too-Big-to-Fail,\\" performance under the Community Reinvestment Act, and pending legal challenges. A coalition of national civil rights and consumer groups, led by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, were joined by Rep. Barney Frank to challenge immediate approval of the deal. The groups argued that the acquisition was a test of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, under which systemically risky firms must demonstrate a public benefit that outweighs new risk before they are allowed to grow. Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank head Thomas M. Hoenig was also skeptical of the deal. In February 2012, the acquisition was approved by regulators and Capital One completed its acquisition of ING Direct. Capital One received permission to merge ING into its business in October 2012, and rebranded ING Direct as Capital One 360 in November 2012. In April 2011, Capital One signed a deal with Kohl's to handle Kohl's private label credit card program that was previous serviced by Chase Bank for a seven-year period for an undisclosed amount. The contract between the two companies was extended in May 2014. In August 2011, Capital One reached a deal with HSBC to acquire its U.S. credit card operations. Capital One paid $31.3 billion in exchange for $28.2 billion in loans and $600 million in other assets. The acquisition was completed in May 2012. On February 26, 2012, along with several other banks, Capital One announced support for the Isis Mobile Wallet payment system. However, in September 2013, Capital One dropped support for the venture. In 2012, Capital One closed 41 branch locations. In 2015, Capital One closed several branch locations to leave 174 operating branches in the D.C. metro area. On February 19, 2014, Capital One became a 25% owner in ClearXchange, a Peer-to-peer transaction money transfer service designed to make electronic funds transfers to customers within the same bank and other financial institutions via mobile phone number or email address. ClearXchange was sold to Early Warning in 2016. In January 2015, Capital One acquired Level Money, a budgeting app for consumers. On July 8, 2015, the company acquired Monsoon, a design studio, development shop, marketing house and strategic consultancy. In 2015, Capital One acquired General Electric's Healthcare Financial Services unit, which included $8.5 billion in loans made to businesses in the healthcare industry, for $9 billion. In October 2016, Capital One acquired Paribus, a price tracking service, for an undisclosed amount. In July 2019, Capital One signed a deal with Walmart to handle Walmart's private label and co-branded credit card programs that was previously serviced by Synchrony Financial. =Exit from mortgage banking (2006‚Äì2007 and 2011‚Äì2017)= In November 2017, President of Financial Services Sanjiv Yajnik announced that the mortgage market was too competitive in the low rate environment to make money in the business. The company exited the mortgage origination business on November 7, 2017, laying off 1,100 employees. This was the second closure; the first occurred on August 20, 2007, when GreenPoint Mortgage unit was closed. GreenPoint had been acquired December 2006 when Capital One paid $13.2 billion to North Fork Bancorp Inc. The re- emergence into the mortgage industry came in 2011 with the purchase of online bank ING Direct USA. =Other acquisitions= In May 2018, the company acquired Confyrm, a digital identity and fraud alert service. In November 2018, Capital One acquired Wikibuy, a shopping comparison app and browser extension from an Austin, Texas start-up business; Wikibuy has no connection with Wikipedia/Wikimedia. Divisions Capital One operates 3 divisions as follows: * Credit cards ‚Äì Capital One issues credit cards in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom and is the 3rd largest credit card issuer, after JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. As of December 31, 2018, Capital One had $107.350 billion in credit card loans outstanding in the United States and $9.011 billion of credit card loans outstanding in Canada and the United Kingdom, with credit cards representing 47.3% of total loans outstanding. * Consumer banking ‚Äì offers banking services, including checking accounts, saving accounts, and money market accounts via its branches and direct bank as well as retail and auto loans. As of December 31, 2018, the company had $2.864 billion in retail loans outstanding and $56.341 billion in car finance loans outstanding, representing 22.9% of total loans outstanding. * Commercial banking ‚Äì As of December 31, 2018, Capital One had $70.333 billion in loans outstanding secured by commercial, multifamily, and industrial properties, representing 28.6% of total loans outstanding. Sports marketing Since 2001, Capital One has been the principal sponsor of the college football Florida Citrus Bowl, which has been called the Capital One Bowl since 2003. It sponsors a mascot challenge every year, announcing the winner on the day of the Capital One Bowl. The name of the stadium was changed in 2014 to the Orlando Citrus Bowl and was then changed again to Camping World Stadium in 2016, following a multi-year naming rights sponsorship with Camping World. Capital One is one of the top three sponsors of the NCAA, paying an estimated $35 million annually in exchange for advertising and access to consumer data. Capital One also sponsored the EFL Cup, an English Soccer Competition, from 2012 to 2016. The company sponsored Sheffield United F.C. from 2006 to 2008. In 2017, the company became the sponsor of the Capital One Arena in Washington D.C. In 2018, to celebrate the Washington Capitals' second-ever Stanley Cup Finals appearance, the firm temporarily changed its logo by replacing the word \\"Capital\\" with the Capitals' titular logo, without the \\"s\\" plural. Corporate citizenship Capital One operates some charitable programs, such as the \\"No Hassle Giving\\" web portal, in which Capital One covers the transaction fees on customer and non-customer donations made through the site. The accountability organization National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy has been highly critical of Capital One's relatively low rate of giving, stating that \\"Capital One's philanthropic track record is dismal\\". The organization pointed out that Capital One's donations of 0.024% of revenue were much less than the industry median of 0.11% of revenue. Capital One has disputed the groups figures, saying that \\"... In 2011 alone, our giving totals are more than 6 times greater ($30 million) than the number given by the NCRP\\". Criticism and legal actions =Fines for misleading customers to pay extra for services= In July 2012, Capital One was fined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for misleading millions of its customers, such as paying extra for payment protection or credit monitoring when they took out a card. The company agreed to pay $210 million to settle the legal action and to refund two million customers. This was the CFPB's first public enforcement action. =Automated dialing to customers' phones= In August 2014, Capital One and three collection agencies entered into an agreement to pay $75.5 million to end a consolidated class action lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that the companies used an automated dialer to call customers‚Äô cellphones without consent, which is a violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991. It is notable that this legal action involved informational telephone calls, which are not subject to the \\"prior express written consent\\" requirements which have been in place for telemarketing calls since October 2013. =2014 amendment to terms of use to allow personal visits= In 2014, Capital One amended its terms of use to allow it to \\"contact you in any manner we choose\\", including a \\"personal visit . . . at your home and at your place of employment.\\" It also asserted its right to \\"modify or suppress caller ID and similar services and identify ourselves on these services in any manner we choose.\\" The company stated that it would not actually make personal visits to customers except \\"As a last resort, . . . if it becomes necessary to repossess [a] sports vehicle\\". Capital One also attributed its assertion of a right to \\"spoof\\" as necessary because \\"sometimes the number is 'displayed differently' by 'some local phone exchanges,' something that is 'beyond our control'\\". =July 2019 security breach= Capital One publicly acknowledged on July 29, 2019 that they had found unauthorized access had occurred ten days earlier by an individual who had breached the account and identity security of 106 million people in the United States and Canada. The FBI arrested Paige Thompson, who had previously worked as a software engineer for Amazon Web Services, Capital One's cloud hosting company. Capital One declared that Thompson had accessed about 140,000 Social Security numbers, a million Canadian social insurance numbers; 80,000 bank account numbers, and an unknown number of names and addresses of customers. Capital One began offering free credit monitoring services to those affected by the breach. Thompson's employment at Amazon appears to have ended in September 2016. Amazon stated that the security vulnerability she used to access Capital One could have been discovered by anyone, the information that facilitated her activity was not gained from work at Amazon, and that she gained access via \\"a misconfiguration of the (Capital One-designed) web application and not the underlying (Amazon-designed) cloud-based infrastructure\\".https://www.cbsnews.com/news/capital-one-hacker-amazon- employee-paige-thompson/ What we know about accused Capital One hacker Paige Thompson. Details of the breach Forensic analysis determined Thompson's actual hacking activity occurred in March 2019, then she posted the information to different outlets over the next three months. In April she posted what came to be known as the \\"April 21 Files\\", a trove of leaked data along with instructions on how to access the company's credentials for more data extraction. In July a white-hat alerted Capital One to Thompson's hacking activity. Thompson pleaded not guilty to charges of wire fraud and computer fraud and abuse. During the investigations and subsequent data freeze, millions of Capital One accounts were locked; their owners were unable to process financial transactions, meet payments, or gain access to their financial records.  Capital One Response  Critics lambasted the bank's effort to downplay the hack while investigations were ongoing, and described the bank as more concerned about its image than the needs of its clients. Several Capital One customers stated that the first time they heard about the hack was through the media and the bank did not disclose the breach or explain its implications to affected customers.https://slate.com/technology/2019/07/capital-one-hack-no-customer- notification.html On social media and in the mainstream press, Capital One's contradictory July 2019 press statement was mocked for saying \\"No bank account numbers or Social Security numbers were compromised,\\" but then listing hundreds of thousands of bank account numbers and social security numbers that were compromised.  Federal Reserve Action  On August 6, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors announced a cease and desist order against Capital One resulting from the breach. The order mandated, among other things, significant improvements in Capital One's governance, risk management and compliance (GRC) practices.  Lawsuits  Lawsuits were filed against Capital One and its employees in federal and circuit courts. Additional Lawsuits were filed against both Amazon and Github, alleging they were aware of the exploit but did not act to fix or patch the vulnerability = Government Investigations = Relative to other large banks, Capital One has received fewer sanctions or default judgments against it. But some allude this is a result of its close proximity to Washington DC and possible relations with federal regulators. In 2015 the bank disclosed that it was under federal investigation for bank fraud, money laundering, and possible racketeering charges. No further information was given and government investigators would only confirm that it was under scrutiny for \\"unspecified charges\\". In 2018, Capital One was fined $100 million for failure to monitor, detect, and prevent money laundering. Charging documents specified Capital One failed to file suspicious activity reports, had deficiencies in its risk assessment, remote deposit capture and generally had weaknesses that compromised national bank security controls. The bank was the subject of a larger investigation that alleged funds were siphoned out of US jurisdiction to safe havens.

Headquartered in the SOMA District, San Francisco, Charles Schwab is the 14th largest banking institution in the United States with over US$3.3 trillion in client assets (as of 2019). It is the third largest asset manager in the world, behind BlackRock and Vanguard. The firm is known for its electronic trading platforms, investor education, and discount brokerage services, particularly reduced and free trading commission charges. Founded as Charles Schwab & Co. in 1971 by its namesake Charles Schwab, the broker-dealer capitalized on the financial deregulation of the 1970s to pioneer discount sales of equity securities. After a flagship opening in Sacramento, the bank expanded into Seattle before the 1980s economic expansion financed the bank's investments in technology, automation, and digital record keeping. The first to offer round- clock order entry and quotation, it was purchased by Bank of America in 1983 for $55 million. Three years later, the profitability of the bank's no-charge mutual funds prompted the founder to buy his company back for $280 million. In line with the Digital Revolution, Charles Schwab offered online trading in 1994 which allowed them to drop and even eliminate account fees by 2005, and introduce commission-free funds by 2011. Charles Schwab offers commercial banking, stock brokerage, and wealth management advisory services to both retail and institutional clients. Despite their online presence, the company also has a large network of physical branches mostly in metropolitan financial centers. Their total national footprint includes 345 branches, primarily in the United States and Britain. It is known for its corporate marketing programs, especially their electric blue nameplate, television commercials, and slogans. In 2020, the bank announced their intention to move to Westlake, Texas in conjunction with their large-scale mergers with and acquisitions of TD Ameritrade (for $26 billion) and the brokerage and investment businesses of USAA (for $1.8 billion). Schwab press release History A Charles Schwab location in Princeton, New Jersey. In 1963, Charles R. Schwab and two other partners launched Investment Indicator, an investment newsletter. At its height, the newsletter had 3,000 subscribers, each paying $84 a year to subscribe. In April 1971, the firm was incorporated in California as First Commander Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Commander Industries, Inc., for traditional brokerage services and to publish the Schwab investment newsletter. In November of that year, Schwab and four others purchased all the stock from Commander Industries, Inc., and in 1972, Schwab bought all the stock from what was once Commander Industries. In 1973, the company name changed to Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. In 1975, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission allowed for negotiated commission rates and Schwab set up a stockbrokerage. In September 1975, Schwab opened its first branch in Sacramento, CA, and started offering discount brokerage services. In 1977, Schwab began offering seminars to clients, and by 1978, Schwab had 45,000 client accounts total, doubling to 84,000 in 1979. In 1979, Schwab risked $500,000 on a back-office settlement system called BETA (which was short for Brokerage Execution and Transaction Analysis), enabling Schwab to become the first discount broker to bring automation inhouse. In 1980, Schwab established the industry's first 24-hour quotation service, and the total of client accounts grew to 147,000. In 1981, Schwab became a member of the NYSE, and the total of client accounts grew to 222,000. In 1982, Schwab became the first to offer 24/7 order entry and quote service, its first international office was opened in Hong Kong, and the number of client accounts totaled 374,000. In 1983, Stephen McLin purchased the company for Bank of America for $55 million. In 1984, the company launched 140 no-load mutual funds. In 1987, management, including Charles R. Schwab, bought the company from Bank of America for $280 million. In 1991, the company acquired Mayer & Schweitzer, a market making firm, allowing Schwab to execute its customers' orders without sending them to an exchange. In 1997, it was fined $200,000 for failing to arrange the best trades for its customers. The unit was renamed Schwab Capital Markets in 2000. In 1993, the company opened an office in London. In 1995, the company acquired The Hampton Company, founded by Walter W. Bettinger, who became CEO of Schwab in 2008. In 1996, Web trading goes live. Customers can trade listed and OTC stocks, or check balances and the status of orders on the schwab.com website. In 1998, dissatisfied by the in-house results, the company hired interactive firm Razorfish to redesign the website. Years later the website would be entered in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum's inaugural National Design Triennial. In 2000, Schwab purchased U.S. Trust for $2.73 billion. In 2001, less than a year after the acquisition of U.S. Trust, the U.S. Trust subsidiary was fined $10 million in a bank secrecy law case. It was ordered to pay $5 million to the New York State Banking Department and $5 million to the Federal Reserve Board. On November 20, 2006, Schwab announced an agreement to sell U.S. Trust to Bank of America for $3.3 billion in cash. The deal closed in the second quarter of 2007. In January 2004, Schwab acquired SoundView Technology Group for $345 million to add equity research capabilities. David S. Pottruck, who had spent the majority of his 20 years at the brokerage as Charles R. Schwab's right- hand man, shared the CEO title with the company's founder from 1998 to 2003. In May 2003, Mr. Schwab stepped down, and gave Pottruck sole control as CEO. On July 24, 2004, the company's board fired Pottruck, replacing him with its founder and namesake. News of Pottruck's removal came as the firm had announced that overall profit had dropped 10%, to $113 million, for the second quarter, driven largely by a 26% decline in revenue from customer stock trading. After coming back into control, Mr. Schwab conceded that the company had \\"lost touch with our heritage\\", and quickly refocused the business on providing financial advice to individual investors. He also rolled back Pottruck's fee hikes. The company rebounded, and earnings began to turn around in 2005, as did the stock. The share price was up as high as 151% since Pottruck's removal, ten times since the return of Charles Schwab. The company's net transfer assets, or assets that come from other firms, quadrupled from 2004 to 2008. Schwab's YieldPlus fund drew controversy during the 2007 financial crisis because of its -31.7% return. Investors in the Schwab YieldPlus Fund, including Charles Schwab himself, lost $1.1 billion. Schwab closed the YieldPlus funds in 2011. In April 2007, the company acquired The 401(k) Company. On July 22, 2008, Walter W. Bettinger, the previous chief operating officer, was named chief executive, succeeding the company's namesake. Charles R. Schwab remained executive chairman of the company and said in a statement that he would \\"continue to serve as a very active chairman\\". In 2011, the company acquired OptionsXpress. The company also acquired Compliance11, Inc., a provider of compliance software. In 2012, it expanded again by acquiring ThomasPartners, an asset management firm. On July 26, 2019, the company announced it would acquire USAA‚Äôs investment management accounts for $1.8 billion in cash.The deal with USAA closed on May 26, 2020. On November 25, 2019, the company announced its intent to acquire TD Ameritrade for approximately $26 billion in stock. The company also stated they intend to move their headquarters to Westlake, Texas. They stated that \\"a small percentage of roles may move from San Francisco to Westlake over time\\", adding \\"the vast majority of San Francisco-based roles, however, are not anticipated to be impacted by this decision.\\" On February 24, 2020, the company announced it would acquire Wasmer, Schroeder & Company in an all cash purchase. Marketing In 2004, Charles Schwab chose Havas Worldwide (then called Euro RSCG) as its full-service advertising agency. The company launched a series of television ads featuring the slogan Talk to Chuck by Euro RSCG and directed/animated by Bob Sabiston's Flat Black Films in 2005. \\"Talk to Chuck\\" campaign appeared in print media, online, billboards, and branch offices. A blog post in The Wall Street Journal described the ads as effective because they included a single memorable phrase. In February 2013, Schwab hired Crispin Porter + Bogusky (CP+B) as its lead creative agency with Havas Worldwide remaining to create ads for ActiveTrader and optionsXpress. The company launched an advertising campaign by CP+B with the slogan Own Your Tomorrow that same year. In March 2015, Adweek reported on marketing material created by CP+B for Schwab's Intelligent Portfolio service. Schwab Charitable Fund The Schwab Charitable Fund is a donor advised fund which preserves the anonymity of donors by not disclosing individual donor names. Professionally managed accounts are only available through independent investment advisors working with Schwab Advisor Services, a business segment of The Charles Schwab Corporation. It accepts contributions of real estate, private equity or other non-cash assets via a charitable intermediary, with proceeds of the donation transferred to a donor-advised account upon liquidation. This intermediary considers donations on a case-by-case basis, with a typical requirement that assets be valued at $250,000 or more.

A womens team was formed from 2006. Henfield also officially has the oldest Scout group in the country (1st Henfield), dating from 1907. When officially registered in 1908 there were 36 scouts in the group. The group was started in winter 1907-8 by Audrey Wade, whose brother, A. G. Wade, had met Baden-Powell when both were travelling to the UK from Africa when they were in the army. A. G. Wade later had several administrative roles in the developing Scout movement. To the south is Woods Mill, a restored mill, now the headquarters of the Sussex Wildlife Trust, its attractions including an extensive nature trail. There is also a theatre company which is held in the village hall. = Sports facilities = Henfield Leisure Centre at Northcroft has a sports hall and fitness suite. There is a small skate park located next to the sports centre. Near to the leisure centre is Henfield tennis club, founded in 1920. = The Cat House = The Cat House The Cat House is at Pinchnose Green, so called because there used to be a tannery nearby and the process of tanning produces unpleasant odours. This house was once owned by George Ward who had a canary. This bird was killed by a cat belonging to the Anglican Canon Nathaniel Woodard who lived at nearby Martyn Lodge. So incensed was Ward that he painted his house with pictures of a cat holding a bird that would be seen by the canon every time he walked past on his way to the church. He also rigged up strings of sea shells to rattle, and a black figure would appear at a small window called the zulu hole when the hapless canon was seen approaching. = Henfield Museum = Started in the 1930s, Henfield Museum moved to its current location in the Henfield Hall in 1974. It contains collections related to local events and people from mesolithic times onwards as well as local natural history. It also contains materials linked to local people such as Marjorie Baker and William Borrer and enterprises including the Allen-Brown Violet Nurseries and local railway station (closed in 1966). It is run by the Friends of Henfield Museum and the Henfield Parish Council. History Henfield was the home of Colonel Henry Bishop, who was appointed Postmaster General by King Charles II in January 1660-61\\\\. Bishop devised the first type of postmark used in England, which is known to collectors as a Bishop mark. His invention was commemorated in 1963, on the occasion of an exhibition by Henfield Stamp Club. A special date stamp, which included the wording HENRY BISHOP'S VILLAGE, was used. Bishop is buried in Henfield churchyard. The eighteenth century botanist William Borrer, who specialised in the flora of the British Isles, was born and died in Henfield. When the British government introduced the Cat and Mouse Act in 1913, local Suffragette Elizabeth Robins used her 15th century farmhouse at Backsettown, near Henfield, that she shared with Octavia Wilberforce, as a retreat for suffragettes recovering from hunger strike.

Originally, the term derived from confession: The writer is not only autobiographically recounting his life, but confessing to his sins. Among the earlier examples is St. Augustine's Confessions, perhaps the first autobiography of Western Europe. In it, he not only recounted the events of his life, he wrestled with their meaning and significance, as in a passage where he tried to fathom why he had stolen pears with friends, not to eat but to throw away. Jean-Jacques Rousseau turned it to a secular purpose in his Confessions. From this meaning evolved the meaning of writing that reveals more of the writer's motivations, particularly the darker reactions, and the events that are normally kept secret. Fictionally, the confessional story is a story written, in the first person, about emotionally fraught and morally charged situations in which a fictional character is caught. These stories may be anything from thinly veiled recounting of the writer's life to completely fictional works. With the advent of the magazine True Story in 1919 and the imitations of it, the confessional (or romance) magazine was created, containing such stories.Linda M. Scott, Fresh Lipstick: Redressing Fashion and Feminism p 158 Such confessions magazines were chiefly aimed at an audience of working-class women.Maureen Honey, Creating Rosie the Riveter: Class, Gender and Propaganda during World War II, p. 139, Their formula has been characterized as \\"sin-suffer-repent\\": The heroine violates standards of behavior, suffers as a consequence, learns her lesson and resolves to live in light of it, not embittered by her pain.Maureen Honey, Creating Rosie the Riveter: Class, Gender and Propaganda during World War II, p. 141-43, See also *Confessional poet References Category:Writing ","title":"Confessional writing"},{"id":"1168199","text":"The Theatre Royal is a historic theatre, a Grade I listed building situated on Grey Street in Newcastle upon Tyne. History The theatre was designed by local architects John and Benjamin Green as part of Richard Grainger's grand design for the centre of Newcastle, and was opened on 20 February 1837 with a performance of The Merchant of Venice. One of the first managers here was Thomas Ternan who employed his wife, Frances Ternan as the main actress.Thomas Ternan, John Simkin, Spartacus Educational, retrieved 19 January 2015 The shareholders of the Proprietors' Committee appointed lessees to manage and programme the theatre. The longest running individual lessee, before Ltd companies, was Edward D Davis from 1845 to 1870 during which in 1867 the interior was redesigned by architect Charles J. Phipps.http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Newcastle/TheatreRoyalNewcastle.htm#gs William Glover and George Francis, both of the Theatre Royal, Glasgow took over from 1871 to 1878; to be followed by Charles Bernard of the Gaiety Theatre, Glasgow until 1882. James Howard and Fred Wyndham of Edinburgh and Glasgow became lessees from 1883 to 1887. Due to their intention, carried out, of also leasing the Tyne Theatre and Opera House, the shareholder committee did not renew their lease of the Royal. Instead, Robert Arthur of Glasgow and now lessee of Her Majesty\`s Theatre, Dundee took over in 1888.http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/Dundee/HerMajestysTheatreDundee.htm After the fire of 1899 he instructed architect Frank Matcham to totally redesign the interior, re-opening in 1901. The venues of Robert Arthur Theatres Ltd in Scotland and England, which had many shareholders in Tyneside, prospered until losses overwhelmed the company in 1911.Graeme Smith (2008),The Theatre Royal: Entertaining a Nation, Glasgow Publications, 2008 At this point the Arthur shareholders, led by the family of Joseph Cowen MP, appointed a new chairman of the lessee company, Michael Simons, of Glasgow, who in 1895 had created Howard & Wyndham Ltd. From 1912 onwards the Theatre Royal Newcastle was an important part of the Howard & Wyndham group, led successfully by chairman Simons, followed by the Cruikshank family, whose King's Theatre, Edinburgh joined the group in 1928. Newcastle City Council took over ownership in 1967. Newcastle, Glasgow and Edinburgh formed a triangle of industry, commerce and entertainment business from the 1870s onwards. From 1962 and increasingly from the 1970s the interchange of shows and pantomimes was joined by tours each year of Scottish Opera and of Scottish Ballet. Opera North joined in. Graeme Smith (2008), The Theatre Royal: Entertaining a Nation, Glasgow Publications, 2008 Following a performance of William Shakespeare's play Macbeth, a huge fire destroyed the interior of the building in 1899. It had its interior redesigned by Frank Matcham and reopened on 31 December 1901. Externally, the building is exactly as it was when it was first built. It underwent a major refurbishment and restoration in the latter part of the 1980s, reopening on 11 January 1988 with a performance of A Man For All Seasons starring Charlton Heston. The Theatre Royal went dark on 14 March 2011 due to a major restoration of the auditorium, box office, bars and restaurant. The restoration restored the theatre to the original 1901 Frank Matcham Edwardian interior. The whole interior was stripped apart from the original plasterwork which was carefully preserved. The proscenium arch, tiers and boxes were gold leafed and the plasterwork restored. On all levels the seats were replaced with Edwardian-style theatre seats in keeping with the restoration. The amphitheatre which was removed during previous renovations was restored to offer more leg room and better views than the gallery. This took the theatre to five distinct seating areas, the stalls, grand circle, upper circle, amphitheatre and gallery. Wheelchair spaces were installed on levels which had previously been inaccessible. As well as the boxes near the stage, boxes at the rear of the grand and upper circles were also restored taking the total number of boxes up to ten. The stage lift and orchestra pit were replaced to offer better facilities for opera and musicals. A new ventilation system was put in place to improve comfort levels in the theatre. New frescos for the lobby and upper circle were commissioned and put in place. This ¬£4.75m project introduced higher standards of comfort and improved energy. The Theatre Royal reopened on 12 September 2011 with Alan Bennett's epic period drama The Madness of George III; George III was in fact the monarch who gave the Theatre Royal its charter. The theatre currently hosts a variety of shows, including ballet, contemporary dance, drama, musicals and opera. The Christmas pantomime is one of the UK's most popular. Clive Webb, Danny Adams and Chris Hayward are the main actors. Almost all of the shows that come to the Theatre Royal are part of national British tours, and in a typical year the theatre will have 30 to 35 visiting shows. For the annual pantomime, and any visiting musicals and opera performances, there is a sizeable orchestra pit available which can seat 60 musicians if necessary. The stage itself is also of substantial size, and can house 50 singers, dancers, actors and musicians. The Original Theatre Royal Newcastle's original Theatre Royal opened on 21 January 1788. Its location on Mosley Street obstructed plans for the redevelopment of the city centre (as it was on the route of Grey Street), so it was demolished to make way for the present building. One of the theatre's most successful managers at this time was Stephen Kemble of the famous Kemble family,https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/18th-century- newcastle-theatre-royal-8635356 who managed the theatre from 1791 to 1806. The original theatre's final performance was on 25 June 1836. Technical details The current theatre has a proscenium stage, and accommodates a variable orchestra pit on 2 lifts - which reduces the stall seating. The audience is seated on four levels: stalls (501), grand circle (252), upper circle (249) and gallery (247). Project A Project A is a one-year actor training programme led by an artistic director and supported by leading industry specialists. Delivered from within the Theatre Royal over an academic year (3 terms) participants gain professional standard actor training culminating in a production term to be performed in the Studio Theatre and toured nationally. The course started in September 2015 with the first year free for the successful actors. The programme is seen as an alternative to drama school and is expected to lift the actors involved into the industry. The Royal Shakespeare Company have very strong ties to the theatre and are involved with the programme heavily in the second term.Theatre Royal References External links * *History page at the Official Site * Theatre Royal History * History of The Theatre Royal * Theatre Royal, Project A Category:Grade I listed theatres Category:Grade I listed buildings in Tyne and Wear Category:Theatres in Newcastle upon Tyne Category:Theatres completed in 1837 Category:Neoclassical architecture in England Category:Drama schools in the United Kingdom Category:Theatre in the United Kingdom Category:John and Benjamin Green buildings and structures ","title":"Theatre Royal, Newcastle"},{"id":"1168204","text":"The second USS Marblehead (C-11/PG-27) was a Montgomery-class unprotected cruiser in the United States Navy, authorized in the naval appropriations bill of September 7, 1888. Marblehead served in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and World War I, and was the last ship of her class in service. Marblehead was laid down in October 1890 by City Point Iron Works, Boston, Massachusetts; launched 11 August 1892; sponsored by Mrs. C. F. Allen; and commissioned 2 April 1894, Commander Charles O'Neil in command. She was named for the seaport Marblehead, Massachusetts. Service history =Pre- Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War= Assigned to the North Atlantic Station, Marblehead departed New York 6 June 1894, for the Caribbean in response to a change of government in Nicaragua. The ship arrived in port 19 June at Bluefields and found that city to be the point of greatest danger. On 7 July, in response to dispatches from the American consul, she put ashore a landing party of Marines and bluejackets to protect American interests. Reinforced by a second party 31 July, this force remained ashore until 7 August. Five days later, Marblehead departed Bluefields to continue cruising the Caribbean, showing the flag in Latin American waters until 26 November, when she departed Port Royal, Jamaica, for Hampton Roads, Virginia, arriving on 6 December. The cruiser stood out from Norfolk 4 March 1895, for duty on the European Station. Sailing via the Azores, the ship arrived at Gibraltar 31 March. During April and May, she cruised the Mediterranean, spending much time on patrol in Syrian waters, and then steamed for Germany to represent the U.S. at the 20 June opening of the Kiel Canal. For the next five months, the ship cruised along the coast of western Europe and in the Mediterranean steaming over and visiting more than 40 foreign ports. Marblehead then returned to the U.S., anchoring at Tompkinsville, New York 23 November 1896. On 1 February 1897, the ship was again assigned to the North Atlantic Station, and for the remainder of the year cruised the east coast and the Caribbean in training. =Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War= At the outbreak of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Marblehead was at Key West, Florida. Immediately sailing for Cuban waters, she arrived off Havana 23 April 1898, and then proceeded to Cienfuegos where she shelled enemy vessels and fortifications on 29 April, in support of the invasion of Guant√°namo Bay. After joining the blockading squadron, she cut the cables off Cienfuegos on 11 May, when many of her sailors and Marines received Medals of Honor. She then patrolled off Santiago de Cuba until early June. In company with the auxiliary cruiser , Marblehead captured the lower part of Guant√°namo Bay as a base for the fleet 7 June, and supported the landing of a battalion of Marines there three days later. Continuing operations in the bay, she helped the pre- dreadnought battleship destroy the Spanish fort on Cayo del Toro on 15 June. On July 26 and 27 she assisted in the clearing of 27 contact mines from Guantanamo Bay, for which three of her crew members, Chief Carpenter's Mate Axel Sundquist, Boatswains Mate Second Class William H. Morin and Ordinary Seaman Samuel Triplett, received the Medal of Honor. The ship remained in Cuban waters until 2 September, when she sailed for the St. Lawrence River on 20 October to participate in ceremonies opening the Champlain Monument in Quebec. =Pre‚ÄìWorld War I= Marblehead repaired at Boston Navy Yard from 2 November 1898 to 9 February 1899, and, following a brief cruise to the Caribbean, proceeded through the Straits of Magellan 16 June to join the Pacific Squadron on 4 July. She cruised off the coast of South America, Mexico, and California until she decommissioned at Mare Island Navy Yard, 30 April 1900. She was recommissioned 10 November 1902, to devote the next four years to cruising along the west coast of North and South America, from Alaska to Chile on training and protocol missions. On 9 January, 1903 she collided with () in San Francisco Bay in dense fog, doing $2,500 in damage to Pomona. From October 1903 to March 1904, she served as flagship of Rear Admiral Henry Glass, Commander of the Pacific Squadron. The cruiser decommissioned at Mare Island Navy Yard 1 October 1906, and remained at the yard until 31 March 1910, when she was loaned to the California Naval Militia as a training ship. She was placed in commission in reserve, 22 July 1911, and in 1916 was turned over to the Oregon Naval Militia as training ship for that state. =World War I= Marblehead was again placed in full commission 6 April 1917, at the Puget Sound Navy Yard, and 4 May was ordered to the Pacific Patrol Force. She was employed on convoy, patrol, and survey duty, operating off Mexico and in search of possible German raiders in the California area until 11 June 1918, when she proceeded via the Panama Canal to Key West for duty with the American patrol detachment. Arriving at Key West 22 June, the ship spent the remainder of World War I in the Caribbean, engaged in escort and patrol duty. Detached from patrol duty 4 December, the cruiser steamed to join Division 2, Pacific Fleet. She arrived Mare Island 17 February 1919, and decommissioned 21 August. Reclassified PG-27 in July 1920, Marblehead was sold 5 August 1921.

He was the main author of the currency reform in the Second Polish Republic and served as Prime Minister of Poland in 1920 and from 1923 to 1925. He was the brother of Stanis≈Çaw Grabski and Zofia Kirkor-Kiedroniowa. He was responsible for the creation of the Bank of Poland and implementing the Polish z≈Çoty. Grabski's cabinet became the longest standing cabinet in interwar Poland. At the same time, however, Grabski's cabinet was severely criticized. Stanis≈Çaw G≈ÇƒÖbi≈Ñski, for example, criticized Grabski's inefficiencies in the sphere of international relations, and Wincenty Witos disapproved of Grabski's deficient agricultural reform, as well as his inability to inform the public of the state's real financial situation. Life W≈Çadys≈Çaw Grabski was born in 1874, in a family manor in Bor√≥w (a part of Gmina Bielawy) near ≈Åowicz, Congress Poland, Russian Empire. He studied politics at the School of Political Science in Paris and history at the University of Sorbonne. While in Paris, Grabski's political views changed. He abandoned the socialist ideas and turned more towards the right. W≈Çadys≈Çaw Grabski as rector of Warsaw University of Life Sciences The years W≈Çadys≈Çaw Grabski had spent in Paris became an impetus behind Grabski's desire for his involvement in the Polish government. Soon after Grabski's return from Paris, in 1905, he founded the Agricultural Society in ≈Åowicz, in central Poland. The Society quickly won the support of many peasants, which in turn led to the creation of the National Labor Union. Due to the growing autonomy and strength of Grabski's Agricultural Society and the Union, in 1905, W≈Çadyslaw Grabski was arrested by the Russian authorities and imprisoned in Warsaw. Grabski's imprisonment, however, lasted less than a year. In 1905, Grabski was elected on behalf of National Democracy as a member of three successive sessions of the Duma, the legislative assembly of the Russian Empire. He was a deputy in Duma until 1912. It was at that time that he became involved in the work of the budgetary commission with the Russian Ministry of Agriculture. Grabski's involvement in the budgetary Commission became a reason for his later desire to become the finance minister in the Polish parliament. When World War I broke out, he organized the Central Citizens' Committee, which was responsible for restoring order into the life of a society devastated by the Polish partitions, and to represent the interests of Polish people before the Russian authorities. He also became a member of the Polish National Committee. In 1919 he entered the government of the newly restored Poland as Minister of Agriculture. Grabski's influence on the Polish affairs increased when he became Treasury Minister and Prime Minister in 1920. However, his first cabinet lasted for only one month. In December 1923 he was again appointed Prime Minister and served as Treasury Minister in a specialist cabinet (appointed by but not necessarily composed of elected parliamentary representatives). Grabski managed to implement reforms which alleviated Poland's economic situation and managed to preserve his cabinet for twenty- three months, a relatively long period for a Polish cabinet in interwar Poland. Until the end of 1924, Grabski's government enjoyed great popularity. Yet Grabski remained a controversial figure for the twenty-three months he remained in office. Stanis≈Çaw G≈ÇƒÖbi≈Ñski, for example, argued that in the sphere of foreign relations, Grabski did not show the desired assertiveness. At the League of Nations conference, Grabski did not mention the League's unresponsiveness to the Polish-Soviet War of 1919‚Äì1921. According to the tenth article of the treaty of Versailles, ‚ÄúThe Members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League.‚Äù However, the League of Nations remained aloof and impassive in 1920. Grabski's decision not to raise the issue of the League's lack of action resulted in severe criticism from the Polish parliament. G≈ÇƒÖbi≈Ñski was not the only critic of Grabski's cabinet. Wincenty Witos criticized Grabski for his excessively optimistic attitude regarding the financial reforms and so did others; nevertheless, the reform stopped the hyperinflation in its tracks. On 13 November 1925 Grabski was forced to resign following a disagreement with the President of the Bank of Poland, who refused to help him with the backing of the industrialist 'Lewiatan' organization. = Currency reform = Grabski's (and the ministerial cabinet's) great achievement in those years was the foundation of the Bank of Poland and the creation of the new Polish currency ‚Äì the gold-based z≈Çoty which replaced the Polish mark. The Act of 11 January 1924 on the improvement of the state's treasury and currency reform introduced a new monetary system and established the issuing bank. The Bank of Poland was founded as a joint stock company, which guaranteed its independence from the government and the state treasury. The Act also abolished the Polish National Savings Union which had acted as an issuing bank. Its functions were taken over by the Bank of Poland. Stanis≈Çaw Karpi≈Ñski became the first president of the Bank of Poland. On 14 January the organizing committee of the Bank of Poland was established, and on 26 January the sale of the bank's shares began. Payments could only be made in foreign currencies and in gold. On 15 April, during the first shareholders' meeting, the Bank of Poland Joint Stock Company was established. Grabski went further than just establishing the Bank of Poland and the currency. He built a network of state banks and founded the Bank for National Economy. He also initiated far-going changes in the structure of Polish exports and industrial output. He also established the Border Defence Corps. Grabski's coffin on a funeral bier, 4 March 1938 Nevertheless, criticism continued over aspects of Grabski's reforms. In 1925, Grabski himself commented that he was too optimistic about his economic reforms and that he should have realized that given the circumstances of depression and the recuperation from World War I), a complete recovery of Polish economy was virtually impossible. There were enormous price discrepancies between agricultural and manufactured goods. The Bank of Poland was faced with both a commercial deficit and an increasing national debt. The government made numerous unfavorable investments and in 1925, the Sejm approved a proposal for an excessively high budget, despite frequent warnings from Grabski's cabinet. On 29 July 1925, the value of the Polish z≈Çoty declined significantly. A tariff war broke out between Poland and Germany. Grabski resigned his post and from active politics in November of that year. He subsequently devoted himself to pedagogic and academic work at the Warsaw Agricultural University (SGGW). In 1926, he became its rector. In 1936 on his motion the Rural Sociology Institute was established, of which he remained the head until his death in 1938. W≈Çadys≈Çaw Grabski died from cancer on 1 March 1938 in Warsaw. The Holy Mass was led by Cardinal Aleksander Kakowski in the Saint John's Cathedral. His body was interred in the family grave at the PowƒÖzki Cemetery.  Legacy  In 2004, Poland celebrated the 130th anniversary of W≈Çadyslaw Grabski's birthday and the 80th anniversary of the public finance reforms he introduced. In September 2003, the Sejm of the Republic of Poland passed a resolution proclaiming 2004 as W≈Çadyslaw Grabski's Year.Uchwa≈Ça Sejmu Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej z dnia 19 wrze≈õnia 2003 r. w sprawie og≈Çoszenia roku 2004 rokiem W≈Çadys≈Çawa Grabskiego In 2004 a statue was unveiled in his birthplace village of Bor√≥w.≈Å√≥dzki UrzƒÖd Wojew√≥dzki w ≈Åodzi: W ho≈Çdzie tw√≥rcy z≈Çot√≥wki ‚Äì 7 July 2004 The Warsaw Agricultural University labelled him as a \\"great Pole, great statesman, social activist and a man of great heart and mind, one of the brightest Poles of the interwar period\\".Uchwa≈Ça Nr 19 ‚Äì 2002/2003 Senatu Szko≈Çy G≈Ç√≥wnej Gospodarstwa Wiejskiego w Warszawie z dnia 24 lutego 2003 r.

Its origins and ethnic identity are a matter of contention between scholars. Origins The origin of the Zhongshan state is disputed; some sources, such as the Records of the Grand Historian, label the state as being formed by Beidi peoples, while others only list them as not being Zhou or Han. Zhongshan occupies roughly the same place as the earlier Xianyu state. The two countries, being Zhongshan and Xianyu, have a muddled history, as the term Zhongshan begins somewhat before the term Xianyu ends. Zhongshan, meaning central mountains, is first mentioned in 506BC, by a Jin minister, as a hostile neighboring state. The last mention of the Xianyu, meanwhile, is in 489BC, when Zhao Yang, a Jin minister, leads a military campaign against them. There are three reasons Zhongshan is often considered a continuation of Xianyu: Both had similar relationships with Qi and Jin, the two states were located in almost exactly the same place, and there is no historical record of Xianyu being conquered. It is considered possible that the name change marks a transition from a loosely-controlled confederation of Di tribes, to a more centralized state. One challenge to this theory of continuation is that after Zhongshan was conquered in 407-406, by the state of Wei, Marquess Wen of Wei gave the land to his eldest son Ji, and the state was based upon this. However this theory is contradicted by a line of the Shiji, in which it states that the new state of Zhongshan came some time after this. Some theories postulate that this new state was a continuation of the earlier Xianyu, and others saying the ruling family of the new Zhongshan came from a line of the Zhou. Because of this, there is no definitive answer as to the ethnicity of Zhongshan, or even to the ethnicity of the royal family; however, it is known that the country's population was mixed. History The first major event of Zhongshan was the capital being placed at Gu, in 414BC, during the reign of Duke Wu, traditionally considered the founding of the country itself. Soon after this, in 407, Zhongshan was conquered by Wei troops, led by general Yue Yang. It is said that Yue Yang's son was living in Zhongshan when war was declared, and was taken hostage. He was paraded before Yue Yang in order to weaken morale, but when this failed, they killed his son and made him into stew, before sending part of said stew to Yue Yang, which he drank in front of the Zhongshan messenger to show resolve. Shortly after, in 381, Zhongshan won its independence back. Zhongshan invaded Yan in 315, after Yan's king, Zi Kuai, abdicated his throne to his chancellor, Zi Zhi. Qi and Zhongshan both separately invaded Yan. Zhongshan seized copper mines in this war, which had previously belonged to the Donghu, but which had been taken by Yan in war. Zhongshan's troops were led by Sima Zhou. In 306, after the state of Zhao, under King Wuling of Zhao, finished a military reform, adopting the uniforms and tactics of the Hu nomads, they invaded Zhongshan. After ten years of war Zhao annexed them in 296. Foreign relations Zhongshan was unusual in that despite being such a small nation, it managed to survive for a long time, considering that many countries, large and small, of the Warring States period lived very short lifespans. Guo Songtao credits this to shrewd diplomacy, saying: \\"In the rises and falls of the Warring States, Zhongshan seems to be the unnoticed hub and lynchpin.\\" Despite their small size, they demonstrated impressive resilience and strength; they are the only small nation to be given their own chapter in the Strategies of the Warring States. In 323BC, Zhongshan formed a vertical alliance, allying itself with Wei, Han, Zhao, and Yan, in order to defend themselves against larger states like Qin, Qi, and Chu. This alliance allowed the states in it to claim the title of wang (a title roughly equivalent to King). King Wei of Qi, who had 11 years earlier taken the title of wang for himself, objected to this, saying: \\"I am ashamed to be a king[,] if the ruler of Zhongshan can be one too\\". He later went on to say: \\"I am a state of ten thousand chariots and Zhongshan is one of a thousand chariots, how dare she [Zhongshan] assume a title the equal of mine?\\". An important part of this statement can be seen in his reason for denouncing them claiming kingship is not that they were non-Chinese (Huaxi), which would very likely have been mentioned in the insult if it were true. The fact that Zhongshan was invited to the five state alliance is seen as another proof of them being Chinese, as a barbarian (Yi) country would never be invited to such an alliance. After this, King Wei of Qi asked Wei and Zhao to join him in attacking Zhongshan, to force them to abolish their title of wang, however, King Cuo sent an advisor, Zhang Deng, to these states, and successfully sowed discord and distrust amongst them, and no such alliance was formed. =Zhao= The state of Zhao surrounded Zhongshan almost entirely, with only Zhongshan's northeastern border being outside of Zhao. For this reason, they were considered to be a \\"disease in the heart and belly\\" by the Zhao kings. From 307 BC on, Zhao attacked Zhongshan almost every year, until, in 301, the king of Zhongshan was forced to take refuge in Qi. During this time Qi declared war on and invaded Chu; seeing that Qi was occupied with a war of their own, Zhao pushed deep into Zhongshan, and fully conquered them. Economy Due to commonality of finds of iron agricultural tools in the southern part of Zhongshan, compared to the commonality of animal skeletons in the northern part, it is believed that the southern land's economy was mostly agriculture, and the northern land's was mostly from animal husbandry. =Currency= Zhongshan used a currency called chengbo, which took the form of a 15 gram bronze knife shaped coin. It is known that these coins were made in at least Lingshou. The level of trade, and the relationship, Zhongshan had with other states can be roughly ascertained from the amount of a currency was found in the ruins of Lingshou: the yan knife coins from Yan were plentiful, with some 374 being found, whereas the gandan, baihua, and lin coins of Zhao are rare, with only 100 of them, combined, found. This reflects the hostile relations Zhao had with Zhongshan, and the good relations Yan had with Zhongshan. Indeed, even the similarities of the yan and chengbo knife coins seems to suggest their friendly relationship, as they were of similar size and of equal weight, with both weighing fifteen grams, meaning that they would be interchangeable. Archeology and culture Much of the knowledge of Zhongshan architecture comes from the remains of their capital city, Lingshou, and from the tombs of King Cheng, and his son King Cuo. In the late 1970s, the tombs of both kings were found in Pingshan County, Hebei, and the capital city was found shortly after, in 1976, only a mile to the east of King Cuo's tomb. =Tombs= alt=An etched copper slab, with gold and silver added to it. The tombs of the two kings, Cheng and Cuo, were the first find of any Zhongshan architecture, and are considered the richest find of any Chinese state of the 4th century BC. They are the largest of any tombs of the Zhongshan to date. Both of their main chambers had been looted, however their storage chambers were still intact, and contained a large number of artifacts. Many of these ritual vessels found in these tombs were from surrounding warring states, with a few coming from the northern nomads, but the luxury goods were largely of the Zhongshan style. This split, between archeological evidence supporting the thesis that they were a Chinese people (Huaxia), and textual sources claiming them as a non-Chinese people, has caused two fields of thought; one side seeing the Zhongshan as a sinicized minority, an outside group that has been heavily influenced by Chinese culture, and the other seeing them as a Chinese people that were influenced by non-Chinese, nomadic peoples. =Cities= The capital city, Lingshou contained many ruins, including the foundations of palaces, workshops for bronze and ceramic, marketplaces, and cemeteries. The cemeteries around Lingshou contain some 125 tombs, and dozens more are scattered throughout the country. The city is believed to have been founded in 380, and to have remained the capital until 296, when Zhongshan was conquered. The city is strategically placed, surrounded on its west, north and south sides by the Taihang Mountains, with its east side facing plains. Like many other capitals of the time, the city was built at the confluence of two rivers. The city was about wide east to west, and wide north to south. Of the cities walls, only the earthen foundation remains, but it is known that they ranged between being and wide. Two gates can be seen, one on the west side and the other on the north side. Four pounded-earth terraces were attached to the walls, some near the gates. A small hill, called Huangshan, is inside the walls, in the north section of the city. The Shui Jing Zhu says that this hill is what gives the Zhongshan, meaning \\"central mountain\\", their name. The hill is believed to have been used as a watchtower. For further fortification, a small city was built to the east. This small city/fort was by . The remains of the pounded earth and buildings of the centre-western part still stand. This city was used to defend the only angle from which to attack Lingshou, which was clearly placed based upon military considerations, rather than economic or political. =Social classes= The official that was in charge of managing the tile-making workers in pottery workshops was called a Sikou. The Zhouli describes Sikou to mean an officer in charge of penal codes and convicts, suggesting that Zhongshan's tile production was reliant on, at least in part, convict labor. =Religion= The ideology of Zhongshan was heavily influenced by Confucian ideals, but it is believed that these ideals were used by the King to legitimize his rule, and his foreign policy, rather than being truly believed by the ruling class. This can be seen in their use of Confucian ideology regarding the ruler being heavenly mandated, in order to attack Yan, and seize cities and materials. A key religious area, Guocun, was located some 4,000 meters southwest of Lingshou, and contained 142 sacrificial pits. These pits were roughly by in area, and between and deep. In each of these pits, an animal, usually sheep, goats, or cattle, was found with its legs tied together, and was buried with a jade item, usually a pendant or bi disk. These pits, and their contents, are very similar to the sacrificial pits of Jin, where they are believed to have been used ceremonially, to form \\"oaths of alliances\\" (mengshi). The connection of the two has been seen as evidence of a strong Jin cultural influence upon the elites of Zhongshan. =Language= The characters and style of Zhongshan Chinese is closest to the Chinese of the Qi, but was also influenced by the more southern Chinese states. Their style of calligraphy were very slender and graceful, while also being very taut. It is believed that this style of calligraphy was chosen by King Cuo himself, to emphasize his power. Military According to the L√ºshi Chunqiu the soldiers of Zhongshan wore iron armor, and wielded iron staffs. They were said to be able to field up to a thousand chariots.

History The club was formed in 1883, and was originally made up of players exclusively of the old boys of Eton School, Westminster School and Charterhouse School but were quickly expanded to include players from all Universities and public schools. In the early days they would field up to five teams a week in order to meet all engagements. For the duration of the 1890 FA Cup, the team merged with that of the Old Carthusians, who had won the trophy nine years previously. They were founder members of the Isthmian League in 1905 and won the FA Amateur Cup in 1936. In their early days playing the game they would tour the country like the Corinthians, and sometimes play more than one game in the same day, and at different venues, not at the same ground. They would also play more than once or twice a week, including playing everyday except Sunday. In 1913, they defeated New Crusaders by 3 goals to 2 in the final of the AFA Senior Cup, after the Casuals scored a winning goal in the final minute. In 1939, the club merged with Corinthian following a meeting on 4 January to form a new club Corinthian-Casuals at the end of the season.

He was assassinated on 8 June 1992 by members of the Islamist group El Gama'a El Islamya after being accused of blasphemy by a committee of clerics (ulama) at al-Azhar. Foda was one of 202 people killed by \\"politically motivated assaults\\" in Egypt between March 1992 and September 1993. In December 1992, his collected works were banned.  Biography Farag Foda was born in El Zarqa near Damietta in the Nile Delta. He worked as professor of agriculture. He wrote numerous books and contributed as a columnist to the Egyptian magazine October. Foda wrote during a time of Islamic revival and growing influence of Islamism, both violent and non- violent. In Iran, Islamists had overthrown the Shah in 1979. In 1983, Hezballah suicide bombers destroyed the barracks of the American and French troops stationed in Beirut, killing hundreds. In Egypt, Marxist intellectuals (such as Muhammad Imara or Tariq al-Bishri) converted to Islamism. Long out of fashion, beards became common, and hijab \\"became the norm rather than the exception in universities and government\\" offices. In the early 1980s, Islamic radicals assassinated president Anwar Sadat and attacked Coptic churches and homes, and extorted jizya (Islamic protection tax) from Coptic Christians. (From 1992-1998, the group that assassinated Foda fought an insurgency against the Egyptian government during which at least 796 Egyptian policemen and soldiers, Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya fighters, and civilians including dozens of foreign tourists were killed.) Muslim Brotherhood ideologue Yusuf al-Qaradawi blamed the extremist violence in part on the failure to give Islam \\"the place it deserves in government, legislation and guidance.\\"Yusuf al-Qaradawi, al- Sahwa al-Islamiyya bayna al-Jumud wal-Tatarruf (Cairo: Dar al-Shuruq, 2001, 1982), p. 20. Quoted in Soage, Ana Bel√©n (2007). \\"Faraj Fawda, or the Cost of Freedom of Expression\\". Middle East Review of International Affairs 11 (2): 26‚Äì33. =Views and opinions = Among the few who defended secularism and ‚ÄòWestern‚Äô human rights, was Farag Foda. Foda was noted for his critical articles and trenchant satires about Islamic fundamentalism in Egypt. In many newspaper articles, he pointed out what he believed to be weak points in Islamist ideology and its demand for Sharia law, asking how it would deal with specific problems such as the housing shortage. He specifically criticized leading Islamist figures‚Äîpointing out that Anwar al-Jundi had praised the secularist, anti-Muslim Brotherhood regime of Gamal Abdel-Nasser in a 1965 book, or that Muhammad al-Hayyawan, a Muslim Brotherhood leader who had attributed the 1988 Armenian earthquake to God‚Äôs punishment of the ‚Äòatheist‚Äô Soviet Union, had not offered an explanation for the 1990 earthquake in Iran. Foda felt that he was defending Islam against its distortion by Islamists, stating ‚ÄòIslam is a religion and Muslims are human beings; religion is blameless, while humans make mistakes‚Äô. After an Islamist periodical condemned as immoral the broadcast of the ballet Swan Lake on television, he argued that the problem lay with \\"the onlooker (mushahid) rather than the looked upon (mushahad)\\" and quoted passages from a 1979 book The Jurisprudence of Looking in Islam, which directs men to avoid looking at both women and males and, \\"in particular, smooth-faced boys\\". In a column in October magazine, he lamented, \\"the world around us is busy with the conquest of space, genetic engineering and the wonders of the computer,\\" while Muslim scholars concern themselves with sex in paradise.  Assassination  On 8 June 1992, Foda, after leaving his office, was shot dead by two assassins. His son and other bystanders were seriously wounded in the attack. The two gunmen had reportedly been \\"monitoring Farag Foda‚Äôs movements and watching his house in al-Nuzha area in Heliopolis for several weeks\\". The jihadist group Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya claimed responsibility. Before his death, Farag Foda had been accused of blasphemy by Al-Azhar. The Al-Azhar ulama had thereby adopted a previous fatwƒÅ by Sheikh al-Azhar, Jadd al-Haqq, accusing Foda and other secularist writers of being \\"enemies of Islam\\". In a statement claimed responsibility for the killing, Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya accused Foda of being an apostate from Islam, advocating the separation of religion from the state, and favouring the existing legal system in Egypt rather than the application of Shari‚Äôa (Islamic law). The group explicitly referred to the Al-Azhar fatwƒÅ when claiming responsibility. An Al-Azhar scholar, Mohammed al-Ghazali, later asserted as a witness before the court that it was not wrong to kill an apostate. Al-Ghazali said: \\"The killing of Farag Foda was in fact the implementation of the punishment against an apostate which the imam (the Islamic leader in Egypt) has failed to implement.\\" Eight of the thirteen Islamists brought to trial for the murder were subsequently acquitted. One of those involved in Foda's murder, Abu El'Ela Abdrabu (Abu Al-'Ela Abd Rabbo), was released from prison in 2012 having served his sentence. In an interview which aired on Al-Arabiya TV on June 14, 2013 (as translated by MEMRI), Abdrabu defended Foda's murder, stating that \\"The punishment for an apostate is death, even if he repents\\" and that \\"...[if] the ruler does not implement the shari'a, any of the citizens is entitled to carry out Allah's punishment.\\" Abdrabu also stated that \\"Farag Foda is dead, and will receive his in the Hereafter.\\" When asked about the feelings of Foda's children, Abdrabu accused the interviewer of using \\"venomous methods\\" against him, and then stated \\"let me ask you if you were not harmed by someone who cursed the Prophet and his wives?

Negit (along with nearby Paoha Island) is a volcanic cone less than 2000 years old. It can be considered to be the northernmost of the Mono Craters. Negit is composed of three dark dacite lava flows. Negit is an important nesting ground for migratory birds, including the California gull, which can often be seen wheeling in the air above Mono Lake. The fall of the lake level since 1941 created a land bridge to the island. The land bridge permitted predators, such as coyotes, to raid the bird eggs of the island. However, since 1994, the lake level has been permitted to rise and the land bridge is currently submerged. thumb Negit Island is accessible by boats (commonly kayaks). However, the island is off-limits from April 1 through August 1, to protect the nesting gulls.

Hagbard (Old Norse Hagbar√∞r), the brother of Haki and son of Hamund, was a famous Scandinavian sea-king in Norse mythology. He is mentioned in Sk√°ldskaparm√°l, Ynglinga saga, Nafna√æulur, V√∂lsunga saga and Gesta Danorum. The heroes' connections with other legendary characters place the events in the 5th century AD. Hagbard remained well-known until recent times in the legend of Hagbard and Signy. This famous legend tells that Hagbard fell in love with Signy, the daughter of king Sigar, the nephew of king Siggeir (of the V√∂lsunga saga), a love affair which ended in their deaths, when Sigar wanted to have Hagbard hanged. This legend is told most fully in Gesta Danorum (book 7). However, most legends surrounding Hagbard are probably lost. In the V√∂lsunga saga, Gudrun and Brynhild have a discussion on the \\"greatest of men\\" referring to a legend now lost, where Hagbard is mentioned together with Haki's sons, who have not yet avenged their sisters by killing the evil Sigar (the feud with Sigar is still going on and Hagbard not yet hanged): Snorri Sturluson wrote in the Ynglinga saga that Hagbard occasionally plundered together with his brother Haki. Concerning, the adventures and death of the Swedish king Jorund (whom Snorri makes a successor of Haki), he cites the poem H√°leygjatal by a Norwegian skald named Eyvindr sk√°ldaspillir containing the Kenning Sigar's steed referring to the legend of Hagbard and Signy: {  :En Gu√∞laugr :grimman tamdi :vi√∞ ofrkapp :austrkonunga :Sigars j√≥, :er synir Yngva :mengl√∂tu√∞ :vi√∞ mei√∞ reiddu. :Og n√°rei√∞r :√° nesi dr√∫pir :vingamei√∞r, :√æar er v√≠kur deilir, :√æar er fj√∂lkunnt :um fylkis hreyr :steini merkt, :Straumeyjarnes.Ynglinga saga at Norr√∏ne Tekster og Kvad  :By the fierce East-kings' cruel pride, :Gudlog must on the wild horse ride -- :The wildest horse you e'er did see: :'Tis Sigur's steed -- the gallows tree. :At Stromones the tree did grow, :Where Gudlog's corpse waves on the bough. :A high stone stands on Stromo's heath, :To tell the gallant hero's death.Laing's translation at the Internet Sacred Text ArchiveLaing's translation at Northvegr  } The same kenning appears with Hagbard's name in a stanza from Ynglingatal, which Snorri also quotes in the same section: {  :Var√∞ J√∂rundr :hinn er endr of d√≥, :l√≠fs of lattr :√≠ Limafir√∞i, :√æ√° er h√°brj√≥str :h√∂rva Sleipnir :bana Go√∞laugs :of bera skyldi; :ok Hagbar√∞s :hersa valdi :h√∂√∞nu leif :at halsi gekk.A second online presentation of Ynglingatal  :Jorund has travelled far and wide, :But the same horse he must bestride :On which he made brave Gudlog ride. :He too must for a necklace wear :Hagbert's fell noose in middle air. :The army leader thus must ride :On Horva's horse, at Lymfjord's side.  } Notes Category:Heroes in Norse myths and legends ","title":"Hagbard"},{"id":"1168280","text":"Max Geldray Max van Gelder (12 February 1916 ‚Äì 2 October 2004), professionally known as Max Geldray, was a jazz harmonica player. Best known for providing musical interludes for The Goon Show, he was also credited as being the first harmonica player to embrace the jazz style. Geldray was born in the Netherlands and played jazz in England, Belgium, France and his home country, before settling in Britain at the outbreak of the Second World War; he was wounded during the Invasion of Normandy. He appeared in nearly every episode of The Goon Show, providing one of the musical interludes and the closing music for each programme. After The Goon Show series finished in 1960, he settled in the US, where he worked as an entertainer in the Reno casinos alongside the likes of Sarah Vaughan and Billy Daniels. Moving to Palm Springs, he eventually became a part-time counsellor at the Betty Ford Center. He was married twice and has one son. Geldray died in 2004 at the age of 88. Early life (1916‚Äì46) Geldray was born Max Leon van Gelder, on 12 February 1916 in Amsterdam, Netherlands to Jewish parents. His father, Leon van Gelder, was a commercial traveller, and his mother was Margarite, n√©e Baillosterky. By 1922 Leon was the European Manager for Maja perfume and the family moved out of Amsterdam to Bilthoven. Both parents could play the piano‚ÄîLeon was self- taught and played by ear, while Margarite was classically trained‚Äîand it was Leon who started to teach Geldray how to play. He developed love of jazz music after hearing Louis Armstrong on the radio in 1928; Geldray later wrote \\"how could anyone not love its energy, its vitality and the freedom of its form? And Louis Armstrong among all the players, became something special to me\\". Django Reinhardt, friend and playing companion of Geldray In February 1930 Geldray heard a mouth organ player on BBC Radio and mentioned the performance to a friend, Hans Mossel, owner of a music shop in Amsterdam; Mossel had ordered a chromatic harmonica the previous week and gave it to Geldray, who practised assiduously. By 1934 Geldray had made some appearances on Dutch radio and formed a band with eight others; an agent named Franklin billed the group as \\"Mac Geldray and his Mouth Accordion Band\\", changing the surname of the principal to the name he retained for the rest of his life. With his performances, Geldray became the first person to play the harmonica in the jazz style. A change in the format of the band to a quartet and the introduction of a new manager led to a six-week tour of English theatres in 1937, accompanying the comedian Tom Moss; the band changed its name to \\"The Hollander Boys\\". During the tour Moss introduced Geldray to Jack Hylton, who invited him to play in his orchestra for the evening. On his return to the Netherlands, the harmonica band broke up and Geldray travelled alone to Brussels, where he found work playing with the dance orchestra at the club Le Boeuf sur le Toit, where he remained for a year. He then worked with a dance band in The Hague, before joining the house band at the Ostend Casino, the Johnny Fresno Band . He would meet a number of influential acts who were booked to play the casino on occasion, including saxophonist Coleman Hawkins, the English bandleader Ambrose and French bandleader Ray Ventura. Ventura soon offered Geldray a job and in 1937 Geldray moved to Paris. While in Paris, he went to the Hot Club de France and played with jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt, a musician about whom Geldray asserts, \\"I can honestly say that I have never heard anyone better\\". The two became close friends and played together often. With the invasion of France by German forces in early 1940, Geldray travelled to England, where he realised he would be safer. On 20 September 1940 he joined the Royal Netherlands Motorized Infantry Brigade, part of the Dutch army exiled in England. During the war he continued to play and appeared on BBC Radio; in 1942 he was part of the entertainment laid on for Princess Elizabeth's sixteenth birthday at Windsor Castle. During the course of 1942 Geldray also met Sarah Prentice, a 26-year-old Scottish variety artiste, whose professional name was Zaza Peters; the couple married on 18 January 1943. Geldray took part in the Normandy landings with the Prinses Irene Brigade, but was injured by a bomb blast and spent time in a military hospital. Although he did not incur long-term injuries, he suffered from recurring nightmares in the following years. After the liberation of Amsterdam, Geldray travelled to the city to find his parents who had been resident when the Germans invaded. He found that both parents and his sister Xaviere had been killed in a concentration camp by the Nazis. At the end of the war, Geldray returned to Paris and once again found work with Ray Ventura's orchestra for two years, before returning to London in 1947. BBC years (1947‚Äì61) Peter Sellers (top), with Spike Milligan (left) and Harry Secombe (right) in The Goon Show Settling in London, Geldray took up British citizenship, and worked on a number of BBC radio programmes, such as Workers' Playtime, Melody Magazine and Forces' All-Star Bill. In 1951 he provided the musical interludes for a new BBC series Crazy People, a comedy show that starred Harry Secombe, Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and Michael Bentine. Crazy People changed its name for subsequent series to The Goon Show and Geldray was a regular performer in the remaining nine series. The show followed a successful format of a vague plot interspersed by two musical performances; the BBC were using the same structure for a number of radio series, including It's That Man Again (ITMA). In The Goon Show, the musical segments were taken up by Geldray and The Ray Ellington Quartet, with Geldray also playing \\"Crazy Rhythm\\" for the play-out music. On occasions Geldray was given lines to perform, although he felt uncomfortable doing so, and his lack of acting ability became a long-running joke within the programme. Geldray was also the butt of some of the Goons jokes and humour: he was referred to throughout the programmes as \\"Conk\\", on account of his nose, and his performances were often humorously dismissed by the announcer Wallace Greenslade, with such comments as: \\"That was Mr Max Geldray playing a harmonica. We thought you ought to know what it was, anyhow.\\" In the early 1950s Geldray's marriage ended with divorce, after the relationship had \\"burned itself out\\", and he began a relationship with a dancer, Barbara. In 1956 Geldray appeared in three television comedy shows produced by ITV and starring the Goons: The Idiot Weekly, Price 2d (broadcast 24 February ‚Äì 23 April 1956), A Show Called Fred (broadcast 2‚Äì30 May 1956) and Son of Fred (broadcast 17 September ‚Äì 5 November 1956). In 1957 he released an album, Goon with the Wind, which was produced by George Martin and released on the Parlophone label. Later that year, Geldray also appeared in Hancock's 43 Minutes, the Christmas edition of Hancock's Half Hour, broadcast on 23 December 1957. In 1958 the BBC proposed dropping Geldray from The Goon Show in a cost-cutting measure; Peter Sellers threatened to leave the series, and Geldray remained. The Goon Show finished its ten-series run on 28 January 1960. In 1961, with his six-year relationship with Barbara at an end, Geldray worked as an entertainer on four trips on the RMS Queen Elizabeth. On visiting Los Angeles he was impressed by the city and decided to emigrate to the US. Moving to the US (1961‚Äì2004) Geldray worked in the casinos of Reno, appearing with Sarah Vaughan and Billy Daniels; he did not like the city, so returned to Los Angeles. In 1962 he met a divorcee with three children, Susan Donofrio; the couple married that year, and in 1964 they had a son, Philip. Geldray worked for a period as a sales assistant in a clothes shop before becoming the regional sales supervisor for The Christian Science Monitor. In 1972 Geldray returned to the UK to appear in The Last Goon Show of All, a special programme recorded on 30 April and broadcast on 30 April 1972 to mark the 50th anniversary of the BBC. When the BBC refused to pay to fly Geldray from the US, two of the show's cast‚ÄîSpike Milligan and Peter Sellers‚Äîcontributed to his expenses. After the performance, at the Camden Theatre, Princess Margaret came backstage and asked if she could be introduced to Geldray as she was an admirer of his playing. In 1973 Geldray and his family moved to Palm Springs to look after his ailing stepfather; he also played harmonica in the local Trinidad Bar. A local doctor approached him after one set and asked if Geldray would put on a show at his stroke centre, which led to Geldray undertaking voluntary work teaching stroke victims to play the harmonica. Following the death of Geldray's youngest step-son, Timmy, Susan Geldray began drinking to excess, and she underwent treatment at the Betty Ford Center. Geldray subsequently volunteered to help at the clinic and qualified as a counsellor and technician. To raise funds for the clinic he started \\"Jazz without Booze\\", a series of concerts, which included prominent local musicians, including Stan Getz. In 1989 Geldray published his autobiography, Goon With the Wind, using the same title as he had for his 1957 album. Geldray died in Palm Springs of natural causes on 2 October 2004 at the age of 88.

It was first held in January 2001 and has been on the same date every year since. The chosen date is the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz concentration camp by the Soviet Union in 1945, the date also chosen for the International Holocaust Remembrance Day and some other national Holocaust Memorial Days. In addition to the national event, there are numerous smaller memorial events around the country organised by many different organisations, groups and individuals. Since 2005, Holocaust Memorial Day has been supported by the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, a charity set up and funded by the UK Government.

The resulting artwork will be showcased as part of Holocaust Memorial Day 2016. = Moving Portraits = A series of Moving Portraits of Holocaust and genocide survivors screened on big screens in cities across the UK, projected onto London's Royal Festival Hall, and used in dozens of local HMD commemorations. = 70 candles for 70 years with Sir Anish Kapoor = Sir Anish Kapoor designed 70 special commemorative candles, which were lit at 70 HMD activities around the UK, demonstrating the breadth and diversity of the commemorations in every part of the country. Six candles were lit at the UK Commemorative Ceremony to represent the six million Jews murdered in the Holocaust and a candle was taken to Auschwitz Birkenau by Eric Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. =Holocaust Memorial Day event in Parliament 2010= In 2010, Jeremy Corbyn co-chaired an event at the Houses of Parliament where Holocaust analogies were used to criticise the Israeli government's treatment of Palestinians, with the main talk by anti-Zionist Auschwitz survivor Hajo Meyer. The event was criticised by Jon Benjamin, Board of Deputies chief executive, who said: \\"This latest attempt to exploit the most painful chapter in Jewish history in order to berate and demonise Israel is among the most despicable.\\" One audience member, the Holocaust survivor Rubin Katz, said that ‚Äúthe room was brimming with raging hatred, directed at Israel and Jews.‚ÄùDaniel Sugarman, ‚ÄúHolocaust Survivor: Jeremy Corbyn had police remove protesters at event comparing Israel to Nazis‚Äù, The Jewish Chronicle, 1 August 2018. Other commentators saw things differently. One complained, in the Jewish Chronicle, about the presence of ‚ÄúZionist hecklers who shamed Holocaust Memorial events‚Äù.Ruth Clark, Letter, Jewish Chronicle, 2 February 2010. One eye-witness complained about ‚Äúthe hounding of 85-year old Dr. Meyer, and the bellows of ‚Äòboring!‚Äô every time any survivor of a different genocide tried to tell about their experience.‚ÄùAmanda Sebestyen, ‚ÄúZionists outraged as Holocaust Memorial Day recognises other genocides‚Äù, London Progressive Journal, 12 February 2010; Yael Kahn, ‚ÄúZionist thugs interrupt talk‚Äù, Indymedia UK, 7 February 2010.

Jonathan Hoffman, a vice-chair of the Zionist Federation, confirming his involvement in this protest, wrote that ‚Äúthe meeting descended into chaos no fewer than nine times, as we protested.‚ÄùJonathan Hoffman, ‚ÄúCorbyn‚Äôs response to the anti- semitism at HMD 2010: ‚ÄòCarry on ‚Ä¶‚Äô‚Äù, We Are The 99% of Jews ‚Ä¶ Anti-semitism from the dark side Blog, 1 August 2018.

The fact that he was in Auschwitz for ten months is entirely irrelevant.‚ÄùHoffman, ‚ÄúCorbyn‚Äôs response to the anti-semitism at HMD 2010: ‚ÄòCarry on ‚Ä¶‚Äô‚Äù. In 2018, when he was asked about his involvement with the meeting, Corbyn said that \\"Views were expressed at the meeting which I do not accept or condone. In the past, in pursuit of justice for the Palestinian people and peace in Israel/Palestine, I have on occasion appeared on platforms with people whose views I completely reject.\\" History Since 1996, 27 January has officially been Gedenktag f√ºr die Opfer des Nationalsozialismus (Day of Remembrance for the Victims of National Socialism) in Germany. Italy and Poland have adopted similar memorial days. On 10 June 1999, Andrew Dismore MP asked Prime Minister Tony Blair about the creation of memorial day for the Holocaust. In reply, Tony Blair also referred to the ethnic cleansing that was being witnessed in the Kosovo War at that time and said: > I am determined to ensure that the horrendous crimes against humanity > committed during the Holocaust are never forgotten. The ethnic cleansing and > killing that has taken place in Europe in recent weeks are a stark example > of the need for vigilance. A consultation took place during October of that year. On 27 January 2000, representatives from forty-four governments around the world met in Stockholm to discuss Holocaust education, remembrance and research. At the conclusion of the forum, the delegates unanimously signed a declaration. This declaration forms the basis of the Statement of Commitment (see below) adopted for Holocaust Memorial Day. In 2005 the United Nations voted, by 149 votes out of 191, to formally commemorate the Holocaust. Statement of Commitment for Holocaust Memorial Day in the UK The statement of commitment for HMD in the UK was created after the Stockholm Declaration was agreed. It is a simplified version of the Stockholm Declaration, and includes a commitment to remember all victims of Nazi Persecution, and victims of all genocides. Many HMD activity organisers use this by arranging for participants to read from as part of their activity. # We recognise that the Holocaust shook the foundations of modern civilisation. Its unprecedented character and horror will always hold universal meaning. # We believe the Holocaust must have a permanent place in our nation's collective memory. We honour the survivors still with us, and reaffirm our shared goals of mutual understanding and justice. # We must make sure that future generations understand the causes of the Holocaust and reflect upon its consequences. We vow to remember the victims of Nazi persecution and of all genocide. # We value the sacrifices of those who have risked their lives to protect or rescue victims, as a touchstone of the human capacity for good in the face of evil. # We recognise that humanity is still scarred by the belief that race, religion, disability or sexuality make some people's lives worth less than others'. Genocide, antisemitism, racism, xenophobia and discrimination still continue. We have a shared responsibility to fight these evils. # We pledge to strengthen our efforts to promote education and research about the Holocaust and other genocide. We will do our utmost to make sure that the lessons of such events are fully learnt. # We will continue to encourage Holocaust remembrance by holding an annual Holocaust Memorial Day. We condemn the evils of prejudice, discrimination and racism. We value a free, tolerant, and democratic society. Criticism =Muslim Council of Britain= Between 2001 and 2007, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) expressed its unwillingness to attend the ceremony. The MCB instead called for a more inclusive day proposing the commemoration of deaths in Palestine, Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, along with the Holocaust. In a press release dated 26 January 2001 the Council listed two points of contention that prevented them from attending the event, which were that it \\"totally excludes and ignores the ongoing genocide and violation of Human Rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, in Jammu and Kashmir and elsewhere\\" and that \\"It includes the controversial question of alleged Armenian genocide as well as the so-called gay genocide.\\" The MCB did not send official representatives to any of the official events associated with Holocaust Memorial Day. In 2005 Iqbal Sacranie suggested that the deaths of Palestinians should also be remembered.David Leppard Muslims boycott Holocaust remembrance - Times Online, TimesOnline 23 January 2005 In a public and controversial interview on the BBC programme Panorama,Staff. A transcript of \\"A question of Leadership\\", first broadcast 21 August 2005, BBC website he, the then General Secretary of the MCB, denied that the policy constituted a boycott. The MCB subsequently made an official complaint to the BBC that their position had been misrepresented by selective editing of the interview. This complaint was rejected by the BBC. The MCB policy of withholding participation was condemned variously by Labour MP Louise Ellman, Peter Tatchell representing the lesbian and gay human rights group OutRage!,Peter Tatchell. Muslim Council of Britain - Holocaust prejudice, blog website www.petertatchell.net, 6 January 2005, Accessed 2007-06-18 and Terry Sanderson of the British National Secular Society.Terry Sanderson. Panorama and the MCB, Letter to The Guardian 23 August 2005 On 3 December 2007, the MCB voted to end the boycott. Assistant General Secretary Inayat Bunglawala argued it was 'inadvertently causing hurt to some in the Jewish community'. The MCB renewed their boycott for the 2009 commemoration, in reaction the 2008‚Äì2009 conflict in Gaza. Despite initially refusing to confirm whether or not they would take part in the 2010 commemoration, they eventually voted to send a junior representative, Dr Shuja Shafi, to attend the event in London. =Armenians= The event also drew similar criticism in 2000 from the United Kingdom's Armenian community, who complained that the event remained exclusively for commemorating those who perished in the Holocaust, and not the Armenian Genocide.For a study of these two events in relation to one another, see Robert Melson, Revolution and Genocide: On the Origins of the Armenian Genocide and the Holocaust. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992. . Neil Frater, an official from Tony Blair's Race Equality Unit, a branch of the Home Office, replied that it had consulted the Holocaust Memorial Day Steering Group on the issue and had agreed that while it understood that the Armenian Genocide was an \\"appalling tragedy\\", it wanted to \\"avoid the risk of the message becoming too diluted if we try to include too much history.\\"Fisk, Robert. The Great War for Civilisation: The Conquest of the Middle East. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2006, p. 345. .Fisk, Robert. \\"Britain excludes Armenians from memorial day.\\" The Independent. 23 November 2000. Frater went on to say that it had gone on with the Steering Group's advice to reject commemorating the Genocide. His comments were received with even more criticism. Zaven Messerlian, the principal of the Armenian Evangelical College in Beirut, Lebanon, stated that \\"any serious commemoration must include the aetiology of genocide, particularly those of the twentieth century, especially if one encouraged the next.\\" The UK-based Refugee Council also supported this position, since the event was supposed to include \\"all victims of genocide.\\"Ahmed, Kamal. \\"Holocaust Day mired in protest.\\" The Guardian. 21 January 2001. Retrieved 27 January 2007. The British government faced a flurry of public criticism for its decision not to include the Armenian Genocide, most notably in the daily newspaper The Independent from its chief Middle East correspondent, British author Robert Fisk.Fisk. The Great War for Civilisation. pp. 347‚Äì349 After months of pressure, the government allowed 20 Armenian survivors to attend the event in its first annual commemoration. Armenians contended that the British government held out for so long because it wished to preserve its relationship with the successor state of the Ottoman Empire and NATO ally, Turkey. =Holocaust Memorial Day Trust= To mark Holocaust Remembrance Day 2019, the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust released a survey result, commissioned by the Trust and derived from a tick-box online poll of 2006 people undertaken by the market research company Opinion Matters, that claimed \\"five per cent of UK adults don‚Äôt believe the Holocaust\\",\\"We Release Research To Mark Holocaust Memorial Day 2019\\" www.hmd.org.uk/news/we- release-research-to-mark-holocaust-memorial-day-2019/ a figure widely reported in \\"lurid terms\\"Holocaust denial is a sin: exaggerating it is reckless freespeechonisrael.org.uk/holocaust-denial in UK media such as \\"More than 2.6m Brits are Holocaust deniers, poll finds\\".Chris Baynes, \\"More than 2.6m Brits are Holocaust deniers, poll finds\\" ://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home- news/holocaust-memorial-day-poll-uk-jews-murdered-nazi-germany-hope-not- hate-a8746741.html \\"More or Less\\" a BBC radio programme on the use and misuse of statistics, noted that the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust had provided only basic information on its Website Press Release, and said that Opinion Matters had refused to release \\"the full data on individual responses\\".

Inconsistencies in responses suggested lack of clarity in the questions: \\"when asked how many Jewish people were murdered during the Holocaust: only 5 people in the entire survey gave an answer of zero ... so that‚Äôs one quarter of 1% ... a figure inconsistent with the 5% (figure) of people (who) deny the Holocaust occurrence\\".

The Company is also responsible for Instow signal box which opens on occasional Sundays and bank holidays from Easter to October. History Bideford railway station in June 1969 The line was opened from Barnstaple to Fremington in 1848. Passenger trains ran throughout from Barnstaple railway station to Bideford from 2 November 1855 as the Bideford Extension Railway. The line was further extended to Torrington in 1872 when the current Bideford railway station was opened. Passenger services ceased on 2 October 1965 although ball clay traffic continued until 1982. The track was removed in 1985 after some interest by BR in reintroducing a passenger service to Bideford. The trackbed was later converted into the Tarka Trail, a walkway using the formation between Petrockstow (later the terminus of services after the line was truncated in the 1960s) and Barnstaple Junction. In 2009, James May attempted to reconnect the former Bideford station with Barnstaple Junction using an OO scale model train as part of James May's Toy Stories. Unfortunately, the last train - a Hornby Class 395 \\"Javelin\\", and the prototype model for the production models - burnt out at Instow at 12:18am the day after the trains left Barnstaple. In 2011, May returned to complete the challenge with the help of the German model railway attraction Miniature Wonderland, racing several model trains over the from Barnstaple to Bideford. The first train to arrive at Bideford was a Hornby Intercity 125, followed by a hydrogen-powered train and finally, May's own model of LNER 'Pacific' 4472 Flying Scotsman. Visitor attractions A local group has worked in partnership with Devon County Council since 1989 to ensure a preservation presence at the old Bideford station. A replica of the original signal box was built in 1992 and signal levers were installed later. An interactive interpretation centre was opened in the green PMV (Parcels and Miscellaneous Van) in 2019. Short passenger rides have been given at Bideford in the past but the Planet diesel locomotive is currently under extended maintenance which should be completed in 2019. The site has now been fully renovated and is open from Easter to the end of October at weekends and school holidays. Tea on the Train is open in the Mark 1 coach at these times for walkers and cyclists on the Tarka Trail. The site is accessible from the Tarka Trail even when the station site is not open.

This club is named after Varuna (IAST: ), the Vedic divinity that rules the oceans. History The history of RVYC is the history of yacht-racing, sailing, and cruising in Thailand. One of RVYC's co-founders, Prince Bhisatej Rajani, could be regarded as the godfather of sailing in Thailand. His contributions go well beyond the founding of RVYC, for it was he who introduced the king to dinghy sailing. Prince Bhisatej was one of ten persons who answered Walter Meyer's advertisement in the Bangkok Post in April, 1957, seeking boating friends to form a boating club. An Australian, an Italian, two Swiss, and a Thai met at the Cosmopolitan Restaurant in Bangkok. By the end of that lunch, Prince Bhisatej, Sid Watkins, Robert (Rachiman) Gintzburger, Roberto Maestrini, and Walter Meyer launched the Varuna Marine Club, with the aim of promoting all water sports, including power-boating, water-skiing, scuba diving, sailing, cruising, and yacht-racing. The Varuna Marine Club was officially opened on the weekend of 15‚Äì16 February 1958. The RVYC was established in 1957 as the Varuna Marine Club. Prince Bhisadej was in charge of the sailing programme and Swiss resident Walter Meyer was the first flag commodore. The club was bestowed royal patronage (‡πÉ‡∏ô‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ö‡∏£‡∏°‡∏£‡∏≤‡∏ä‡∏π‡∏õ‡∏ñ‡∏±‡∏°‡∏†‡πå) by the King of Thailand on April 26, 1965, becoming the \\"Royal Varuna Yacht Club\\".Yacht Racing Association of Thailand under Royal Patronage The Royal Varuna is a well-equipped sailing club outside Pattaya town on a secluded public beach limited by rocky cliffs on one side. The club's facilities include boat storage, boat repair, parking, a beach bar and a swimming pool. It also rents accommodation with rooms of varying standard. The club's new premises formally opened in 2003. Its main feature is a wide reception area, the \\"Club House\\", where most socializing and official business takes place. There is a restaurant, cafeteria, and bar in the facility. Next to the Club House is a \\"Kid's Club\\" for children. The second floor of the Club House has offices and a television room. Royal patronage In March 1965, the Varuna Marine Club membership was invited to the king's own newly established Royal Chitralada Yacht Squadron at the Klai Kangwon Palace in Hua Hin. After the races, Prince Bhisatej announced that the king had extended royal patronage to the Varuna Marine Club. A month later, on 26 April 1965, the Varuna Marine Club become the Royal Varuna Yacht Club. On 14 September 1968, the king, accompanied by the queen, the crown prince, and princesses, officially inaugurated the Royal Varuna Yacht Club.  Activities  Royal Varuna is an internationally recognized yacht club that regularly organizes sailing events. Regattas occur most weekends and there are annual competitions that include competitors from other parts of Asia. It is a member of the Yacht Racing Association of Thailand (YRAT). It is a principal sponsor of the Phuket King's Cup Regatta. It is possible to rent boats at the RVYC, and instructional courses in Optimist and Laser are available at the club, especially during school holidays.

He ruled Egypt for almost ten years, from late July or early August 1213 BC until his death on May 2, 1203 BC, according to contemporary historical records.J√ºrgen von Beckerath, Chronologie des Pharaonischen √Ñgypten, Mainz, (1997), pp.190 He was the thirteenth son of Ramesses II,Gae Callender, The Eye Of Horus: A History of Ancient Egypt, Longman Cheshire (1993), p.263 only coming to power because all his older brothers had died, including his full brother Khaemwaset or Khaemwase. By the time he ascended to the throne, he was probably around seventy years old. His throne name was Ba-en-re Mery-netjeru, which means \\"The Soul of Ra, Beloved of the Gods\\". He is the first king of Egypt to be identified as \\"pharaoh\\", when the term previously used for the royal palace began to be used as the title for the king by his contemporaries. Merneptah was probably the fourth child of Isetnofret I, the second great royal wife of Ramesses II. Merneptah was married to Queen Isetnofret II, his great royal wife. She likely was his full sister and she bore the same name as their mother. One of their sons, Prince Sety-Merenptah, would succeed him as Seti II. They also were the parents of Prince Merenptah and a daughter, Twosret, who would become the great royal wife and queen of Seti II and, ultimately, pharaoh in her own right. It is presumed that Merneptah also was married to a secondary queen, Takhat. It is possible that they were the parents of the usurper, Amenmesse. Prior to accession A sculpture of Merneptah (from the city known variously as Waset, Luxor, or Thebes) Merneptah was probably the thirteenth son of Ramesses II. This is a result of his father's advanced age and that he outlived many of his heirs (in his 90s, Ramesses II was one of the oldest pharaohs in Egyptian history, if not the oldest). By year 40 of Ramesses II, Merneptah had been promoted to Overseer of the Army, and in year 55 of Ramesses II, Merneptah was officially proclaimed heir and crown prince as Ramesses celebrated his eightieth birthday. After becoming heir, Merneptah took on new responsibilities in administration, mainly becoming prince regent for his elderly, and perhaps senile, father for the last twelve years of the king's life. Chronology According to one reading of contemporary historical records, Merneptah ruled Egypt for almost ten years, from late July or early August 1213 BC until his death on 2 May 1203 BC.J√ºrgen von Beckerath, Chronologie des Pharaonischen √Ñgypten, Mainz, (1997), pp.190 Alternatively, astronomical calculations of a potentially reported annular eclipse (Joshua 10:10-14) that precedes Merneptah's Canaanite campaign against the Israelites, which would place the beginning of his reign in 1209 or 1210 BC. Campaigns Limestone block showing a pair of unfinished cartouches of Merenptah (Merneptah) I, 19th dynasty of Egypt, Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London Merneptah had to carry out several military campaigns during his reign. In the fifth year of his rule, he fought against the Libyans, who-- with the assistance of the Sea Peoples-- were threatening Egypt from the west. Merneptah led a victorious six-hour battle against a combined Libyan and Sea People force at the city of Perire, probably located on the western edge of the Nile delta. His account of this campaign against the Sea Peoples and Libu is described in prose on a wall beside the sixth pylon at Karnak, which states: : [Beginning of the victory that his majesty achieved in the land of Libya] -I, Ekwesh, Teresh, Lukka, Sherden, Shekelesh, Northerners coming from all lands. Later in the inscription, Merneptah receives news of the attack: : ...the third season, saying: 'The wretched, fallen chief of Libya, Meryre, son of Ded, has fallen upon the country of Tehenu with his bowmen--Sherden, Shekelesh, Ekwesh, Lukka, Teresh, Taking the best of every warrior and every man of war of his country. He has brought his wife and his children--leaders of the camp, and he has reached the western boundary in the fields of Perire.'Robert Drews, The End of the Bronze Age, Princeton University Press, 1993. p.49 Merneptah makes an offering to Ptah on a column An inscription on the Athribis Stele, now in the garden of Cairo Museum, declares \\"His majesty was enraged at their report, like a lion\\", assembled his court, and gave a rousing speech. Later he dreamed he saw Ptah handing him a sword and saying \\"Take thou (it) and banish thou the fearful heart from thee.\\" When the bowmen went forth, says the inscription, \\"Amun was with them as a shield.\\" After six hours the surviving Nine Bows threw down their weapons, abandoned their baggage and dependents, and ran for their lives. Merneptah states that he defeated the invasion, killing 6,000 soldiers and taking 9,000 prisoners. To be sure of the numbers, among other things, he took the penises of all uncircumcised enemy dead and the hands of all the circumcised, from which history learns that the Ekwesh were circumcised, a fact causing some to doubt that they were Greek. There is also an account of the same events in the form of a poem from the Merneptah Stele, widely known as the Israel Stele, which makes reference to the supposed utter destruction of Israel in a campaign prior to his fifth year, in Canaan: \\"Israel has been wiped out...its seed is no more.\\" This is the first recognised ancient Egyptian record of the existence of Israel--\\"not as a country or city, but as a tribe\\" or people.Jacobus Van Dijk, \\"The Amarna Period and the Later New Kingdom\\" in The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt, ed. Ian Shaw, Oxford University Press (2000), p.302 Succession Stone sarcophagus of Merneptah in KV8 Merneptah was already an elderly man in his late 60s, if not early 70s, when he assumed the throne. Merneptah moved the administrative center of Egypt from Piramesse (Pi-Ramesses), his father's capital, back to Memphis, where he constructed a royal palace next to the temple of Ptah. This palace was excavated in 1915 by the University of Pennsylvania Museum, led by Clarence Stanley Fisher. Merneptah's successor, Seti II, was a son of Queen Isetnofret. However, Seti II's accession to the throne was not unchallenged: a rival king named Amenmesse, who was either another son of Merneptah by Takhat or, much less likely, of Ramesses II, seized control of Upper Egypt and Kush during the middle of the reign of Seti II. Only after he overcame Amenmesse, was Seti was able to reassert his authority over Thebes in his fifth year. It is possible that before seizing Upper Egypt, Amenmesse had been known as Messuy and had been viceroy of Kush. Mummy Mummy of Merneptah Merneptah suffered from arthritis and atherosclerosis and died as an old man after a reign that lasted for nearly a decade. Merneptah was originally buried within tomb KV8 in the Valley of the Kings, but his mummy was not found there. In 1898 it was located along with eighteen other mummies in the mummy cache found in the tomb of Amenhotep II (KV35) by Victor Loret. Merneptah's mummy was taken to Cairo and eventually unwrapped by Dr. G. Elliott Smith on July 8, 1907. Dr. Smith notes that: > The body is that of an old man and is 1 meter 714 millimeters in height. > Merneptah was almost completely bald, only a narrow fringe of white hair > (now cut so close as to be seen only with difficulty) remaining on the > temples and occiput. A few short (about 2 mill) black hairs were found on > the upper lip and scattered, closely clipped hairs on the cheeks and chin. > The general aspect of the face recalls that of Ramesses II, but the form of > the cranium and the measurements of the face much more nearly agree with > those of his [grand]father, Seti the Great.Grafton Elliot Smith, The Royal > Mummies, Cairo (1912), pp. 65-70 See also * List of children of Ramesses II References Further reading *Eva March Tappan, ed., The World's Story: A History of the World in Story, Song, and Art, (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1914), Vol. III: Egypt, Africa, and Arabia, trans.

Motorists with the tags are allowed to use lanes reserved exclusively for them on all Harris County Toll Road Authority (HCTRA) roads. As of late 2003 the EZ TAG can also be used on all lanes of tolled roadways in Texas that accommodate electronic toll collection.  How it works  An older EZ TAG The inside of an older EZ TAG To participate, a driver signs up through the EZ TAG website, via telephone, or at one of the store locations. Next, the customer receives a small, white radio frequency transponder which must be affixed to the inside of their windshield behind their rear view mirror. Finally, when passing through a toll plaza, the driver chooses lanes specially equipped with sensors that can read EZ TAG transmitters and deduct the appropriate amount from their accounts. Houston Transtar uses EZ TAG sensors, which are placed at numerous points across Greater Houston, for their Automatic Vehicle Identification (AVI) traffic monitoring system. By tracking the movement of individual transponder tags (EZ TAG user vehicles) over the city, the system can generate real time traffic information for use by the general public. The personal information about the EZ TAG customer is not compromised in this process because the EZ TAG database and the AVI system are not interconnected. New transponder The fronts of the newer tags, oldest to newest, left to right The rears of the new tags, oldest to newest, left to right In May 2006, HCTRA introduced a new version of the transponder tag. Instead of battery-powered radio transmitters, the new tags are adhesive stickers with a button-sized microchip in the middle of, and a reflective antenna system throughout the tag. These new tags are sold, rather than rented, so they help save money over the life of the tag by eliminating the monthly $1 rental fee. The battery tag's $15 security deposit can be applied to the purchase of the sticker tag. Removing the sticker after placement has a high probability of either separating the chip from the antenna, de-tuning the antenna from its designated frequency, or both, therefore invalidating the tag for future use. The tag also relies on the windshield for an amplification effect, and its effective range is greatly reduced if it is not mounted on a glass substrate. This range reduction is so much that not having a tag properly mounted will result in it not reading at all in toll lanes. These characteristics are much different compared to the old battery tags, which would read fine if not mounted properly. As such, some toll patrons attempt to hold up their sticker tags when driving through the toll lanes, and appear mystified when they do not work as their old tags did. The new tag uses three different protocols, or communications methods, with the tag readers‚ÄîATA, eGo and SeGo. The protocol used in Houston is ATA for automatic equipment identification; however, a driver in Houston can conceivably use the tag in another state where the other protocols are used. In addition, the tags support ANSI INCITS 256-2001 and ISO 10374. The tag is read by scanners as far as at 915 MHz, and the tag features a 2048-bit read/write passive memory.Business Wire: TXDOT selects TransCore RFIDs To duplicate a 915 MHz EZ TAG, a copy of the ROM 2048-bit chip must be dumped and loaded into another ROM chip and a matched inductance of the RFID EZ TAG surface needs to be constructed.Design of a UHF RFID Antenna Blank 915 MHz RFID pads can be bought online.WavStore = New variations = As of January 2008, three different sets of EZ Tags have been released. The differences are purely cosmetic. Despite the similarity in the names, EZ Tags are not compatible with the E-ZPass system in the northeast U.S. =EZ Tag by BancPass= In November 2015, HCTRA announced a new Cash Reloadable EZ Tag. The EZ Tag by BancPass can be reloaded with cash at major retailers, or the user can reload online using a debit or credit card. The EZ Tag by BancPass also differs from the standard EZ Tag by not reloading automatically. The user is notified when the account balance gets low, and the user can choose when and how much to put on the user's account. The EZ Tag by BancPass is available online, at H-E-B grocery stores and at Corner Store by Valero. Accounts can be reloaded online or at any H-E-B, CVS or Corner Store by Valero.

As one of several modalities in the management of cancer, the specialty of surgical oncology has evolved in steps similar to medical oncology (pharmacotherapy for cancer), which grew out of hematology, and radiation oncology, which grew out of radiology. The Ewing Society known today as the Society of Surgical Oncology was started by surgeons interested in promoting the field of oncology. Complex General Surgical Oncology was ratified by a specialty Board certification in 2011 from the American Board of Surgery. The proliferation of cancer centers will continue to popularize the field, as will developments in minimally invasive techniques, palliative surgery, and neo-adjuvant treatments. Debate Whether surgical oncology constitutes a medical specialty per se is the topic of a heated debate. Today, some would agree that it is simply impossible for any one surgeon to be competent in the surgical management of all malignant disease. There are currently 19 surgical oncology fellowship training programs in the United States that have been approved by the Society of Surgical Oncology and this number is expect to grow.Surgical Oncology Fellowship Training Programs While many general surgeons are actively involved in treating patients with malignant neoplasms, the designation of \\"surgical oncologist\\" is generally reserved for those surgeons who have completed one of the approved fellowship programs. However, this is a matter of semantics, as many surgeons who are thoroughly involved in treating cancer patients may consider themselves to be surgical oncologists. Most often, surgical oncologist refers to a general surgical oncologist (a subspecialty of general surgery), but thoracic surgical oncologists, gynecologic oncologists and so forth can all be considered surgeons who specialize in treating cancer patients. Training The importance of training surgeons who sub-specialize in cancer surgery lies in evidence, supported by a number of clinical trials,Surgical Oncology Program Clinical Trials that outcomes in surgical cancer care are positively associated to surgeon volume‚Äîi.e., the more cancer cases a surgeon treats, the more proficient he or she becomes, and his or her patients experience improved survival rates as a result. This is another controversial point, but it is generally accepted‚Äîeven as common sense‚Äîthat a surgeon who performs a given operation more often, will achieve superior results when compared with a surgeon who rarely performs the same procedure. This is particularly true of complex cancer resections such as pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) for pancreatic cancer, and gastrectomy with extended (D2) lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer. In the United States and Canada, fellowship trained surgical oncologists have among the longest training periods of any physicians/surgeons.

Thus, the neuron \\"mirrors\\" the behavior of the other, as though the observer were itself acting. Such neurons have been directly observed in human and primate species, and birds. In humans, brain activity consistent with that of mirror neurons has been found in the premotor cortex, the supplementary motor area, the primary somatosensory cortex, and the inferior parietal cortex. The function of the mirror system in humans is a subject of much speculation. Birds have been shown to have imitative resonance behaviors and neurological evidence suggests the presence of some form of mirroring system. To date, no widely accepted neural or computational models have been put forward to describe how mirror neuron activity supports cognitive functions. The subject of mirror neurons continues to generate intense debate. In 2014, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B published a special issue entirely devoted to mirror neuron research. Some researchers in cognitive neuroscience and cognitive psychology consider that this system provides the physiological mechanism for the perception/action coupling (see the common coding theory). They argue that mirror neurons may be important for understanding the actions of other people, and for learning new skills by imitation. Some researchers speculate that mirror systems may simulate observed actions, and thus contribute to theory of mind skills,Michael Arbib, The Mirror System Hypothesis. Linking Language to Theory of Mind, 2005, retrieved 2006-02-17 while others relate mirror neurons to language abilities. Neuroscientists such as Marco Iacoboni (UCLA) have argued that mirror neuron systems in the human brain help us understand the actions and intentions of other people. In a study published in March 2005 Iacoboni and his colleagues reported that mirror neurons could discern whether another person who was picking up a cup of tea planned to drink from it or clear it from the table. In addition, Iacoboni has argued that mirror neurons are the neural basis of the human capacity for emotions such as empathy. There are scientists who express skepticism about the theories being advanced to explain the function of mirror neurons. In a 2013 article for Wired, Christian Jarrett cautioned that: Discovery In the 1980s and 1990s, neurophysiologists Giacomo Rizzolatti, Giuseppe Di Pellegrino, Luciano Fadiga, Leonardo Fogassi, and Vittorio Gallese at the University of Parma placed electrodes in the ventral premotor cortex of the macaque monkey to study neurons specialized in the control of hand and mouth actions; for example, taking hold of an object and manipulating it. During each experiment, the researchers allowed the monkey to reach for pieces of food, and recorded from single neurons in the monkey's brain, thus measuring the neuron's response to certain movements. They found that some neurons responded when the monkey observed a person picking up a piece of food, and also when the monkey itself picked up the food. The discovery was initially submitted to Nature, but was rejected for its \\"lack of general interest\\" before being published in a less competitive journal. A few years later, the same group published another empirical paper, discussing the role of the mirror-neuron system in action recognition, and proposing that the human Broca's region was the homologue region of the monkey ventral premotor cortex. While these papers reported the presence of mirror neurons responding to hand actions, a subsequent study by Pier Francesco Ferrari and colleagues described the presence of mirror neurons responding to mouth actions and facial gestures. Further experiments confirmed that about 10% of neurons in the monkey inferior frontal and inferior parietal cortex have \\"mirror\\" properties and give similar responses to performed hand actions and observed actions. In 2002 Christian Keysers and colleagues reported that, in both humans and monkeys, the mirror system also responds to the sound of actions. Reports on mirror neurons have been widely published and confirmedFogassi et al., Parietal Lobe: From Action Organization to Intention Understanding, Science, 2005 with mirror neurons found in both inferior frontal and inferior parietal regions of the brain. Recently, evidence from functional neuroimaging strongly suggests that humans have similar mirror neurons systems: researchers have identified brain regions which respond during both action and observation of action. Not surprisingly, these brain regions include those found in the macaque monkey However, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can examine the entire brain at once and suggests that a much wider network of brain areas shows mirror properties in humans than previously thought. These additional areas include the somatosensory cortex and are thought to make the observer feel what it feels like to move in the observed way. Origin The most common theory behind the origin of mirror neuron is the genetic account which suggests that the mirrorness of mirror neurons is due primarily to heritable genetic factors and that the genetic predisposition to develop Mirror neuron evolved because they facilitate action understanding. The other theories as to the origin of mirror neurons include Associative Learning, Canalization and Exaptation. In monkeys Neonatal (newborn) macaque imitating facial expressions The first animal in which researchers have studied mirror neurons individually is the macaque monkey. In these monkeys, mirror neurons are found in the inferior frontal gyrus (region F5) and the inferior parietal lobule. Mirror neurons are believed to mediate the understanding of other animals' behaviour. For example, a mirror neuron which fires when the monkey rips a piece of paper would also fire when the monkey sees a person rip paper, or hears paper ripping (without visual cues). These properties have led researchers to believe that mirror neurons encode abstract concepts of actions like 'ripping paper', whether the action is performed by the monkey or another animal. The function of mirror neurons in macaques remains unknown. Adult macaques do not seem to learn by imitation. Recent experiments by Ferrari and colleagues suggest that infant macaques can imitate a human's face movements, though only as neonates and during a limited temporal window. Even if it has not yet been empirically demonstrated, it has been proposed that mirror neurons cause this behaviour and other imitative phenomena. Ferrari P.F., Bonini L., Fogassi L. (2009) From monkey mirror neurons to mirror-related behaviours: possible direct and indirect pathways. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, B. .364, 2311-2323 Indeed, there is limited understanding of the degree to which monkeys show imitative behaviour. In adult monkeys, mirror neurons may enable the monkey to understand what another monkey is doing, or to recognize the other monkey's action. In humans Diagram of the brain, showing the locations of the frontal and parietal lobes of the cerebrum, viewed from the left. The inferior frontal lobe is the lower part of the blue area, and the superior parietal lobe is the upper part of the yellow area. It is not normally possible to study single neurons in the human brain, so most evidence for mirror neurons in humans is indirect. Brain imaging experiments using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have shown that the human inferior frontal cortex and superior parietal lobe are active when the person performs an action and also when the person sees another individual performing an action. It has been suggested that these brain regions contain mirror neurons, and they have been defined as the human mirror neuron system. More recent experiments have shown that even at the level of single participants, scanned using fMRI, large areas containing multiple fMRI voxels increase their activity both during the observation and execution of actions. Neuropsychological studies looking at lesion areas that cause action knowledge, pantomime interpretation, and biological motion perception deficits have pointed to a causal link between the integrity of the inferior frontal gyrus and these behaviours. Transcranial magnetic stimulation studies have confirmed this as well. These results indicate the activation in mirror neuron related areas are unlikely to be just epiphenomenal. A study published in April 2010 reports recordings from single neurons with mirror properties in the human brain. Mukamel et al. (Current Biology, 2010) recorded from the brains of 21 patients who were being treated at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center for intractable epilepsy. The patients had been implanted with intracranial depth electrodes to identify seizure foci for potential surgical treatment. Electrode location was based solely on clinical criteria; the researchers, with the patients' consent, used the same electrodes to \\"piggyback\\" their research. The researchers found a small number of neurons that fired or showed their greatest activity both when the individual performed a task and when they observed a task. Other neurons had anti-mirror properties, that is, they responded when the participant performed an action but were inhibited when the participant saw that action. The mirror neurons found were located in the supplementary motor area and medial temporal cortex (other brain regions were not sampled). For purely practical reasons, these regions are not the same as those in which mirror neurons had been recorded from in the monkey: researchers in Parma were studying the ventral premotor cortex and the associated inferior parietal lobe, two regions in which epilepsy rarely occurs, and hence, single cell recordings in these regions are not usually done in humans. On the other hand, no one has to date looked for mirror neurons in the supplementary motor area or the medial temporal lobe in the monkey. Together, this therefore does not suggest that humans and monkeys have mirror neurons in different locations, but rather that they may have mirror neurons both in the ventral premotor cortex and inferior parietal lobe, where they have been recorded in the monkey, and in the supplementary motor areas and medial temporal lobe, where they have been recorded from in human ‚Äì especially because detailed human fMRI analyses suggest activity compatible with the presence of mirror neurons in all these regions. Another study has suggested that human beings don't necessarily have more mirror neurons than monkeys, but instead that there is a core set of mirror neurons used in action observation and execution. However, for other proposed functions of mirror neurons the mirror system may have the ability to recruit other areas of the brain when doing its auditory, somatosensory, and affective components. Doubts concerning mirror neurons Although many in the scientific community have expressed excitement about the discovery of mirror neurons, there are scientists who have expressed doubts about both the existence and role of mirror neurons in humans. According to scientists such as Hickok, Pascolo, and Dinstein, it is not clear whether mirror neurons really form a distinct class of cells (as opposed to an occasional phenomenon seen in cells that have other functions), and whether mirror activity is a distinct type of response or simply an artifact of an overall facilitation of the motor system. In 2008, Ilan Dinstein et al. argued that the original analyses were unconvincing because they were based on qualitative descriptions of individual cell properties, and did not take into account the small number of strongly mirror-selective neurons in motor areas. Other scientists have argued that the measurements of neuron fire delay seem not to be compatible with standard reaction times, and pointed out that nobody has reported that an interruption of the motor areas in F5 would produce a decrease in action recognition. (Critics of this argument have replied that these authors have missed human neuropsychological and TMS studies reporting disruption of these areas do indeed cause action deficits without affecting other kinds of perception.) In 2009, Lingnau et al. carried out an experiment in which they compared motor acts that were first observed and then executed to motor acts that were first executed and then observed. They concluded that there was a significant asymmetry between the two processes that indicated that mirror neurons do not exist in humans. They stated \\"Crucially, we found no signs of adaptation for motor acts that were first executed and then observed. Failure to find cross-modal adaptation for executed and observed motor acts is not compatible with the core assumption of mirror neuron theory, which holds that action recognition and understanding are based on motor simulation.\\" However, in the same year, Kilner et al. showed that if goal directed actions are used as stimuli, both IPL and premotor regions show the repetition suppression between observation and execution that is predicted by mirror neurons. In 2009, Greg Hickok published an extensive argument against the claim that mirror neurons are involved in action-understanding: \\"Eight Problems for the Mirror Neuron Theory of Action Understanding in Monkeys and Humans.\\" He concluded that \\"The early hypothesis that these cells underlie action understanding is likewise an interesting and prima facie reasonable idea. However, despite its widespread acceptance, the proposal has never been adequately tested in monkeys, and in humans there is strong empirical evidence, in the form of physiological and neuropsychological (double-) dissociations, against the claim.\\" The mirror neurons can be activated only after the goal of the observed action has been attributed by other brain structures. Vladimir Kosonogov sees another contradiction. The proponents of mirror neuron theory of action understanding postulate that the mirror neurons code the goals of others' actions because they are activated if the observed action is goal-directed. However, the mirror neurons are activated only when the observed action is goal-directed (object-directed action or a communicative gesture, which certainly has a goal too). How do they \\"know\\" that the definite action is goal-directed? At what stage of their activation do they detect a goal of the movement or its absence? In his opinion, the mirror neuron system can be activated only after the goal of the observed action is attributed by some other brain structures. Neurophilosophers such as Patricia Churchland have expressed both scientific and philosophical objections to the theory that mirror neurons are responsible for understanding the intentions of others. In chapter 5 of her 2011 book, Braintrust, Churchland points out that the claim that mirror neurons are involved in understanding intentions (through simulating observed actions) is based on assumptions that are clouded by unresolved philosophical issues. She makes the argument that intentions are understood (coded) at a more complex level of neural activity than that of individual neurons. Churchland states that \\"A neuron, though computationally complex, is just a neuron. It is not an intelligent homunculus. If a neural network represents something complex, such as an intention [to insult], it must have the right input and be in the right place in the neural circuitry to do that.\\" Churchland, Patricia, Braintrust (2011), Chapter 6, page 142 Recently, Cecilia Heyes (Professor of Experimental Psychology, Oxford) has advanced the theory that mirror neurons are the byproduct of associative learning as opposed to evolutionary adaptation. She argues that mirror neurons in humans are the product of social interaction and not an evolutionary adaptation for action-understanding. In particular, Heyes rejects the theory advanced by V.S. Ramachandran that mirror neurons have been \\"the driving force behind the great leap forward in human evolution.\\" =Development= Human infant data using eye-tracking measures suggest that the mirror neuron system develops before 12 months of age, and that this system may help human infants understand other people's actions. A critical question concerns how mirror neurons acquire mirror properties. Two closely related models postulate that mirror neurons are trained through HebbianKeysers & Perrett, Trends in Cognitive Sciences 8 (2004) or Associative learningBrass, M., & Heyes, C. Trends in Cognitive Sciences 9 (2005) (see Associative Sequence Learning). However, if premotor neurons need to be trained by action in order to acquire mirror properties, it is unclear how newborn babies are able to mimic the facial gestures of another person (imitation of unseen actions), as suggested by the work of Meltzoff and Moore. One possibility is that the sight of tongue protrusion recruits an innate releasing mechanism in neonates. Careful analysis suggests that 'imitation' of this single gesture may account for almost all reports of facial mimicry by new-born infants.  Possible functions  = Understanding intentions = Many studies link mirror neurons to understanding goals and intentions. Fogassi et al. (2005) recorded the activity of 41 mirror neurons in the inferior parietal lobe (IPL) of two rhesus macaques. The IPL has long been recognized as an association cortex that integrates sensory information. The monkeys watched an experimenter either grasp an apple and bring it to his mouth or grasp an object and place it in a cup. * In total, 15 mirror neurons fired vigorously when the monkey observed the \\"grasp-to-eat\\" motion, but registered no activity while exposed to the \\"grasp-to-place\\" condition. * For 4 other mirror neurons, the reverse held true: they activated in response to the experimenter eventually placing the apple in the cup but not to eating it. Only the type of action, and not the kinematic force with which models manipulated objects, determined neuron activity. It was also significant that neurons fired before the monkey observed the human model starting the second motor act (bringing the object to the mouth or placing it in a cup). Therefore, IPL neurons \\"code the same act (grasping) in a different way according to the final goal of the action in which the act is embedded.\\" They may furnish a neural basis for predicting another individual's subsequent actions and inferring intention. = Learning facilitation = Another possible function of mirror neurons would be facilitation of learning. The mirror neurons code the concrete representation of the action, i.e., the representation that would be activated if the observer acted. This would allow us to simulate (to repeat internally) the observed action implicitly (in the brain) to collect our own motor programs of observed actions and to get ready to reproduce the actions later. It is implicit training. Due to this, the observer will produce the action explicitly (in his/her behavior) with agility and finesse. This happens due to associative learning processes. The more frequently a synaptic connection is activated, the stronger it becomes. = Empathy = Stephanie Preston and Frans de Waal, Jean Decety,Decety, J. (2002). Naturaliser l‚Äôempathie [Empathy naturalized]. L‚ÄôEnc√©phale, 28, 9-20. and Vittorio Gallese and Christian Keysers have independently argued that the mirror neuron system is involved in empathy. A large number of experiments using fMRI, electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) have shown that certain brain regions (in particular the anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and inferior frontal cortex) are active when people experience an emotion (disgust, happiness, pain, etc.) and when they see another person experiencing an emotion. David Freedberg and Vittorio Gallese have also put forward the idea that this function of the mirror neuron system is crucial for aesthetic experiences. However, these brain regions are not quite the same as the ones which mirror hand actions, and mirror neurons for emotional states or empathy have not yet been described in monkeys. More recently, Christian Keysers at the Social Brain Lab and colleagues have shown that people who are more empathic according to self-report questionnaires have stronger activations both in the mirror system for hand actions and the mirror system for emotions, providing more direct support for the idea that the mirror system is linked to empathy. Some researchers observed that the human mirror system does not passively respond to the observation of actions but is influenced by the mindset of the observer. Researchers observed the link of the mirror neurons during empathetic engagement in patient care. =Human self awareness= V. S. Ramachandran has speculated that mirror neurons may provide the neurological basis of human self-awareness. In an essay written for the Edge Foundation in 2009 Ramachandran gave the following explanation of his theory: \\"... I also speculated that these neurons can not only help simulate other people's behavior but can be turned 'inward'‚Äîas it were‚Äîto create second-order representations or meta-representations of your own earlier brain processes. This could be the neural basis of introspection, and of the reciprocity of self awareness and other awareness. There is obviously a chicken-or-egg question here as to which evolved first, but... The main point is that the two co-evolved, mutually enriching each other to create the mature representation of self that characterizes modern humans.\\" =Language= In humans, functional MRI studies have reported finding areas homologous to the monkey mirror neuron system in the inferior frontal cortex, close to Broca's area, one of the hypothesized language regions of the brain. This has led to suggestions that human language evolved from a gesture performance/understanding system implemented in mirror neurons. Mirror neurons have been said to have the potential to provide a mechanism for action- understanding, imitation-learning, and the simulation of other people's behaviour.Skoyles, John R., Gesture, Language Origins, and Right Handedness, Psycholoqy: 11,#24, 2000 This hypothesis is supported by some cytoarchitectonic homologies between monkey premotor area F5 and human Broca's area.Petrides, Michael, Cadoret, Genevieve, Mackey, Scott (2005). Orofacial somatomotor responses in the macaque monkey homologue of Broca's area, Nature: 435,#1235 Rates of vocabulary expansion link to the ability of children to vocally mirror non-words and so to acquire the new word pronunciations. Such speech repetition occurs automatically, fast and separately in the brain to speech perception. Moreover, such vocal imitation can occur without comprehension such as in speech shadowing and echolalia. Further evidence for this link comes from a recent study in which the brain activity of two participants was measured using fMRI while they were gesturing words to each other using hand gestures with a game of charades ‚Äì a modality that some have suggested might represent the evolutionary precursor of human language. Analysis of the data using Granger Causality revealed that the mirror-neuron system of the observer indeed reflects the pattern of activity in the motor system of the sender, supporting the idea that the motor concept associated with the words is indeed transmitted from one brain to another using the mirror system The mirror neuron system seems to be inherently inadequate to play any role in syntax, given that this definitory property of human languages which is implemented in hierarchical recursive structure is flattened into linear sequences of phonemes making the recursive structure not accessible to sensory detection =Automatic imitation= The term is commonly used to refer to cases in which an individual, having observed a body movement, unintentionally performs a similar body movement or alters the way that a body movement is performed. Automatic imitation rarely involves overt execution of matching responses. Instead the effects typically consist of reaction time, rather than accuracy, differences between compatible and incompatible trials. Research reveals that the existence of automatic imitation, which is a covert form of imitation, is distinct from spatial compatibility. It also indicates that, although automatic imitation is subject to input modulation by attentional processes, and output modulation by inhibitory processes, it is mediated by learned, long-term sensorimotor associations that cannot be altered directly by intentional processes. Many researchers believe that automatic imitation is mediated by the mirror neuron system. Additionally, there are data that demonstrate that our postural control is impaired when people listen to sentences about other actions. For example, if the task is to maintain posture, people do it worse when they listen to sentences like this: \\"I get up, put on my slippers, go to the bathroom.\\" This phenomenon may be due to the fact that during action perception there is similar motor cortex activation as if a human being performed the same action (mirror neurons system). =Motor mimicry= In contrast with automatic imitation, motor mimicry is observed in (1) naturalistic social situations and (2) via measures of action frequency within a session rather than measures of speed and/or accuracy within trials. The integration of research on motor mimicry and automatic imitation could reveal plausible indications that these phenomena depend on the same psychological and neural processes. Preliminary evidence however comes from studies showing that social priming has similar effects on motor mimicry. Nevertheless, the similarities between automatic imitation, mirror effects, and motor mimicry have led some researchers to propose that automatic imitation is mediated by the mirror neuron system and that it is a tightly controlled laboratory equivalent of the motor mimicry observed in naturalistic social contexts. If true, then automatic imitation can be used as a tool to investigate how the mirror neuron system contributes to cognitive functioning and how motor mimicry promotes prosocial attitudes and behavior. Meta-analysis of imitation studies in humans suggest that there is enough evidence of mirror system activation during imitation that mirror neuron involvement is likely, even though no published studies have recorded the activities of singular neurons. However, it is likely insufficient for motor imitation. Studies show that regions of the frontal and parietal lobes that extend beyond the classical mirror system are equally activated during imitation. This suggests that other areas, along with the mirror system are crucial to imitation behaviors. =Autism= It has also been proposed that problems with the mirror neuron system may underlie cognitive disorders, particularly autism.Oberman LM, Hubbard EM, McCleery JP, Altschuler EL, Ramachandran VS, Pineda JA., EEG evidence for mirror neuron dysfunction in autism spectral disorders , Brain Res Cogn Brain Res.; 24(2):190-8, 2005-06 However the connection between mirror neuron dysfunction and autism is tentative and it remains to be demonstrated how mirror neurons are related to many of the important characteristics of autism. Some researchers claim there is a link between mirror neuron deficiency and autism. EEG recordings from motor areas are suppressed when someone watches another person move, a signal that may relate to mirror neuron system. This suppression was less in children with autism. Although these findings have been replicated by several groups, other studies have not found evidence of a dysfunctional mirror neuron system in autism. In 2008, Oberman et al. published a research paper that presented conflicting EEG evidence. Oberman and Ramachandran found typical mu-suppression for familiar stimuli, but not for unfamiliar stimuli, leading them to conclude that the mirror neuron system of children with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) was functional, but less sensitive than that of typical children. Based on the conflicting evidence presented by mu-wave suppression experiments, Patricia Churchland has cautioned that mu-wave suppression results cannot be used as a valid index for measuring the performance of mirror neuron systems. Recent research indicates that mirror neurons do not play a role in autism: Some anatomical differences have been found in the mirror neuron related brain areas in adults with autism spectrum disorders, compared to non-autistic adults. All these cortical areas were thinner and the degree of thinning was correlated with autism symptom severity, a correlation nearly restricted to these brain regions. Based on these results, some researchers claim that autism is caused by impairments in the mirror neuron system, leading to disabilities in social skills, imitation, empathy and theory of mind. Many researchers have pointed out that the \\"broken mirrors\\" theory of autism is overly simplistic, and mirror neurons alone cannot explain the differences found in individuals with autism. First of all, as noted above, none of these studies were direct measures of mirror neuron activity - in other words fMRI activity or EEG rhythm suppression do not unequivocally index mirror neurons. Dinstein and colleagues found normal mirror neuron activity in people with autism using fMRI.https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18837-mirror-neurons- seen-behaving-normally-in-autism.html In individuals with autism, deficits in intention understanding, action understanding and biological motion perception (the key functions of mirror neurons) are not always found, or are task dependent. Today, very few people believe an all-or-nothing problem with the mirror system can underlie autism. Instead, \\"additional research needs to be done, and more caution should be used when reaching out to the media.\\" Research from 2010https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18837-mirror-neurons- seen-behaving-normally-in-autism/ concluded that autistic individuals do not exhibit mirror neuron dysfunction, although the small sample size limits the extent to which these results can be generalized. =Theory of mind= In Philosophy of mind, mirror neurons have become the primary rallying call of simulation theorists concerning our \\"theory of mind.\\" \\"Theory of mind\\" refers to our ability to infer another person's mental state (i.e., beliefs and desires) from experiences or their behaviour. There are several competing models which attempt to account for our theory of mind; the most notable in relation to mirror neurons is simulation theory. According to simulation theory, theory of mind is available because we subconsciously empathize with the person we're observing and, accounting for relevant differences, imagine what we would desire and believe in that scenario. Mirror neurons have been interpreted as the mechanism by which we simulate others in order to better understand them, and therefore their discovery has been taken by some as a validation of simulation theory (which appeared a decade before the discovery of mirror neurons). More recently, Theory of Mind and Simulation have been seen as complementary systems, with different developmental time courses. At the neuronal-level, in a 2015 study by Keren Haroush and Ziv Williams using jointly interacting primates performing an iterated prisoner's dilemma game, the authors identified neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex that selectively predicted an opponent's yet unknown decisions or covert state of mind. These \\"other-predictive neurons\\" differentiated between self and other decisions and were uniquely sensitive to social context, but they did not encode the opponent's observed actions or receipt of reward. These cingulate cells may therefore importantly complement the function of mirror neurons by providing additional information about other social agents that is not immediately observable or known. =Sex-Based Differences= A series of recent studies conducted by Yawei Cheng, using a variety of neurophysiological measures, including MEG, spinal reflex excitability, electroencephalography, have documented the presence of a gender difference in the human mirror neuron system, with female participants exhibiting stronger motor resonance than male participants. In another study, sex-based differences among mirror neuron mechanisms was reinforced in that the data showed enhanced empathetic ability in females relative to males. During an emotional social interaction, females showed a greater ability in emotional perspective taking than did males when interacting with another person face-to-face. However, in the study, data showed that when it came to recognizing the emotions of others, all participants' abilities were very similar and there was no key difference between the male and female subjects. = Sleep paralysis / Ghostly Bedroom Intruders = Baland Jalal and V. S. Ramachandran have hypothesized that the mirror neuron system is important in giving rise to the intruder hallucination and out-of-body experiences during sleep paralysis. According to this theory, sleep paralysis leads to disinhibition of the mirror neuron system, paving the way for hallucinations of human-like shadowy beings. The deafferentation of sensory information during sleep paralysis is proposed as the mechanism for such mirror neuron disinhibition. The authors suggest that their hypothesis on the role of the mirror neuron system could be tested: = Mirror neuron function, psychosis, and empathy in schizophrenia = Recent research, which measured mu-wave suppression, suggests that mirror neuron activity is positively correlated with psychotic symptoms (i.e., greater mu suppression/mirror neuron activity was highest among subjects with the greater severity of psychotic symptoms). Researchers concluded that \\"higher mirror neuron activity may be the underpinning of schizophrenia sensory gating deficits and may contribute to sensory misattributions particularly in response to socially relevant stimuli, and be a putative mechanism for delusions and hallucinations.\\" See also * Associative sequence learning * Common coding theory * Emotional contagion * Empathy * Mirror-touch synesthesia * Mirroring (psychology) * Motor cognition * Motor theory of speech perception * On Intelligence * Positron emission tomography * Simulation theory of empathy * Speech repetition * Spindle neuron References Further reading  * Keysers, C., & Gazzola, V.

It opened in 1996 on the road of the same name, once a light industrial area in Stratford, now being redeveloped into housing development called Pudding Mill Lane. It is next to the Olympic Park; however, it was closed for the duration of the 2012 Olympic Games and reopened on 12 September 2012. The original island platform station was permanently closed on 18 April 2014 in order to allow for the construction of a ramp from the new Crossrail portal nearby. A new, larger station built a short distance to the south opened on 28 April 2014. The station is located on the DLR's Stratford to Poplar branch, between the Bow Church and Stratford stations and is on the boundary between Travelcard Zone 2 and Zone 3. Trains also run to Lewisham in the morning peaks History =Original station= Island platform at the original station The plans for the DLR to Stratford included an option for a station at Pudding Mill Lane. Funding was not available to build the station, but the location was one of two places safeguarded for future development, the other being Langdon Park.The DLR Story, London Docklands Development Corporation. Pudding Mill Lane was opened on 15 January 1996. Previously this location had been a simple passing point for trains on the otherwise single- tracked section between Stratford and Bow Church. The name of the station is taken from the nearby Pudding Mill Lane which, in turn, takes its name from the former Pudding Mill River, a minor tributary of the River Lea. This is believed to have taken its name from St. Thomas's Mill, a local water mill shaped like a pudding and commonly known as Pudding Mill.British History Online: Ancient Mills. The area had also been called Knob Hill up until the 1890s.Hidden London: Pudding Mill Lane. When all the other platforms on the DLR's Stratford branch were extended to accommodate three-car trains, Pudding Mill Lane remained with a two-car platform, instead using selective door operation. The lack of platform extensions in this case was due to the pending rebuild of the station. During the 2012 Olympic Games, Pudding Mill Lane station was temporarily closed for safety reasons as, while ideally situated to serve the Olympic site, it was far too small to cope with the probable passenger numbers. The original station closed after the final service of 17 April 2014 and the replacement opened on 28 April. =New station= New station platforms Crossrail, due to open through the area in May 2019, has a tunnel portal to the east of the original Pudding Mill Lane site. The ramp from the portal to track level at Stratford station will pass directly through the original Pudding Mill lane station site, thus requiring a replacement station to be built on a new viaduct nearby.Pudding Mill Lane Portal. Crossrail. The original station was demolished to make way for the new ramp, funded as part of the Crossrail project. This work also permitted the upgrade of the only significant stretch of single track left on the DLR to be doubled. In July 2011, Newham Council's Strategic Development Committee approved plans by architect Weston Williamson for the new station. Sited just to the south of the old station, between the River Lea and City Mill River, it was built with a higher capacity to cope for new developments in the area. It has three-car platforms, better pedestrian links and access to buses, improved step-free access, and provision for escalators.Morgan Sindall site briefing on 29-08-13 References  External links  * Docklands Light Railway website - Pudding Mill Lane station page * Weston Williamson Architects website - Proposed replacement for Pudding Mill Lane DLR station Category:Docklands Light Railway stations in the London Borough of Newham Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1996 Category:Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park Category:Stratford, London ","title":"Pudding Mill Lane DLR station"},{"id":"1168333","text":"The Elsecar Heritage Railway (EHR) is located on the southern part of the former South Yorkshire Railway freight-only branch which ran from Elsecar Junction on its Mexborough to Barnsley Line. The Elsecar Heritage Railway operates an out and back tourist train ride on a section of the branch using steam and diesel locomotives, currently running between Rockingham station (at the back of the Elsecar Heritage Centre) and Hemingfield Basin. The railway is operated using a variety of different preserved rolling stock. The EHR plans eventually to operate the line into Cortonwood, with a new halt at Hemingfield, doubling the length of the line to two miles. History The line was built to serve Earl Fitzwilliam's collieries and ironworks, which he leased out to local ironmasters. It opened in 1850 as part of the South Yorkshire Railway, known as the Elsecar Branch. Following assorted mergers the line finally became part of the LNER upon formation of the Big Four. The whole infrastructure was nationalised after the Second World War, with the mines becoming part of the National Coal Board in 1947 and the railway becoming part of British Railways in 1948. The Elsecar branch closed in 1984 following closure of the final colliery on the line. Restoration began in 1994 as a project of Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council, and the line reopened as a heritage railway in 1996, operated by the Council. The Elsecar Heritage Railway became the operator in 2006.Overview details at Yorkshire.com tourist website.

Cortonwood extension The railway's extension, currently under construction, involves the reinstatement of two level crossings, Tingle Bridge Lane and Smithy Lane. The latter, being a quiet road, will be protected by manually-operated crossing gates of traditional design. Tingle Bridge Lane is a busier road, and the railway is installing a semi-automated crossing barrier system, with barriers manually lowered from a signal box, but automatically raised by track circuitry. On 16 May 2011 the permanent way materials for the level crossing arrived and a donation scheme was set up to raise the remainder of the money needed. Funds raised through this scheme have since been used to purchase barriers and traffic signals for the crossing ready for installation. In August 2012 trial holes were dug to locate services under the road surface ready for the crossing installation to take place. On 21 June 2012 the ground was cleared and levelled for ballast and track alterations in anticipation of constructing the station at Hemingfield, currently the end of the line. On 19 April 2013 the EHR installed the level crossing on Tingle Bridge Lane, financed by a Director's loan, and began extending the line into Cortonwood Colliery, as the next step of the Project. By June 2014 the whole track had been laid up to Cortonwood, with minor levelling and ballasting remaining to become operational. The railway is now engaged in refinements to the permanent way, together with the necessary regulatory processes (with the local authority and the Office of Rail and Road) to see the extension opened for public services. Cortonwood memorial In November 2013 the EHR received a lottery grant of ¬£50,000 to finance the provision of a Coal Mining Memorial Park at Cortonwood Colliery,Award reported by biglotteryfund.org.uk a nationally important site, where the 1984/5 Miners Strike began. The project was completed in November 2014.

Description Although the time and place of these parties is planned, the event itself occurs spontaneously, as each participant decides for themselves what sort of revelry, costume, decorations, snacks, libations and guests to bring to the party. The participants decorate the carriages festively, and play music, either live or on portable sound systems, disguised to appear as normal luggage. Other activities include setting up pole-dancing poles on the trains. Free drinks, snacks and sweets are provided, often being provided from well-stocked portable bars and snack tables, which disappear as the train arrives at the station. Commuters are invited to participate in the parties. To maintain a low profile while the trains are in the stations, most participants only revel and frolic once the trains are in tunnels. Permission is not sought from London Underground or the British Transport Police for Circle line parties, and police sometimes stop trains for long periods to break the parties up. However, their organisers, typically linked to anarchist groups such as the Space Hijackers, claim that Circle line parties are not meant to disrupt travel, but to \\"reclaim the public space from the advertisers and give it back to the people to whom it belongs\\". =May 2008 party= Thousands celebrate the last night of legal drinking on the Underground in May 2008 On 7 May 2008, the newly elected Mayor of London Boris Johnson announced that the drinking of alcohol would be banned on public transport from 1 June. Many people then thought up the idea of a Circle line party to be held at the end of the month to celebrate the last night of legal drinking on the London Underground, and spread the idea on the social networking website Facebook. The plan quickly received media attention and was mentioned in several newspapers. On 31 May, the night itself, thousands of people attended, the largest Circle line party ever. Some dressed in costumes ranging from 1920s prohibition figures to Boris Johnson himself. The line was suspended after several trains were damaged during the party, and a number of London Underground staff and police officers were assaulted. Seventeen people were arrested due to disorderly behaviour and six tube stations were closed as they became overcrowded.

First released in 1994, the game was licensed to Laguna for European release in 1996. It is the second entry in the Breath of Fire series. It was later ported to Game Boy Advance and re-released worldwide. The game was released on Wii's Virtual Console in North America on August 27, 2007. Nintendo of Europe's website mistakenly announced it for release on July 27, 2007, but it was in fact released two weeks later, on August 10, 2007. In 2013, it was released for the Wii U Virtual Console. In 2016, it was released for the New Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console. In 2019, it was released for the Nintendo Switch SNES games library. Unlike later installments in the series, Breath of Fire II is a direct sequel to Breath of Fire. Set 500 years after the original game, the story centers on an orphan named Ryu Bateson, whose family vanished mysteriously long ago. After his friend is falsely accused of a crime, Ryu embarks on a journey to clear his name. Gameplay Breath of Fire II is a traditional role-playing video game featuring two-dimensional character sprites and environments. Players view the game from a top-down perspective and move their characters in four directions across various environments including towns and dungeons while interacting with non-player characters and battling enemies to advance the story. Navigation on a town's map. The game features a redesigned, text-based game menu as opposed to the icon-based design of the original Breath of Fire, as well as a new \\"Monster Meter\\" that indicates the probability of encountering enemy monsters in a given area. Players are required to venture into dangerous areas throughout the game world as dictated by the story, and randomly encounter enemies every few steps which must be defeated to advance. As the game progresses, new characters, each with their own specific abilities, join the player's party. Like the previous game, only four characters may be in a party at a given time, but now may not be freely switched outside of certain areas. Each character has a unique Personal Action that may be performed outside of combat that allows the player to access certain areas, destroy objects, avoid traps, or move about the game more easily. Breath of Fire II includes a new town- building feature that allows the player to populate their own village with special characters found throughout the game. Each character has their own distinct job, and may be invited to live in houses that the player adds by donating currency to one of three carpenters, each with their own building style. Six special inhabitants known as Shamans may also join the town, each with their own elemental alignment, and up to two at a time may be fused with party members to grant them new forms and abilities. While joined with a shaman, characters become stronger and may gain access to additional abilities while in battle. Combat in Breath of Fire II is presented using a turn-based approach, where the player inputs commands for each character at the start of each round with the actions taking place by order of each character's and enemy's \\"agility\\" rating. A new Formation feature allows the player to organize their party into different positions, allowing certain members an increase in speed, defense, or attack power. Players win battles by defeating every enemy present, dealing damage by using normal attacks along with magic spells and items. When all enemies are defeated, they yield experience points that go toward leveling up characters, making them stronger and giving them access to new spells. Each character's health is represented by numerical hit points that indicate their remaining vitality, and are knocked out if the value reaches zero, with the battle ending if each member of a player's party is knocked out. Progress is recorded using the game cartridge's internal battery back-up memory, which can be accessed at dragon statues throughout gameplay. Plot =Characters= The characters of Breath of Fire II were designed by Capcom artist Tatsuya Yoshikawa, who also provided artwork for the cast of the previous game. Breath of Fire II features nine playable characters who join the player's party at set points throughout the story, each with their own selection of attacks, magic spells, and personal actions which can be used to pass certain obstacles and solve puzzles. The main characters of Breath of Fire II. From left to right, back row to front row: Rand, Sten, Jean, Katt, Ryu, Nina, Bow, and Spar. Not shown: Bleu. The main protagonist is a 16-year-old boy named Ryu Bateson, who shares his name with the main character from the original Breath of Fire, who mysteriously finds himself alone in the world one day after his father and sister disappear and all townspeople in his village forget who he is. As a member of the elusive Dragon Clan, Ryu possess the ability to transform into powerful draconic beings with destructive abilities, and makes his way as a \\"Ranger\\", a sword-for-hire. He is joined by his friend and fellow Ranger, Bow (\\"Boche Doggy\\" in the Japanese version), a thief and member of the Grassrunner clan of dog-people who uses a crossbow and healing spells. Throughout the game, players recruit additional characters at different points in the story, including Katt (\\"Rinpu Chuan\\" in the Japanese version), a member of the Woren clan of cat-people who fights at a coliseum; Rand Marks, muscular pangolin-person who fights with his bare hands; Nina Windia, descendant of the original Nina from Breath of Fire and princess of a clan of winged humans who was exiled due to her black wings, a bad omen in her country; Sten Legacy, a former soldier from a kingdom of monkey-people who makes his way as a trickster and performer; Ekkal Hoppa de Pe Jean, or simply Jean (\\"Tapeta\\" in the Japanese version), a love-struck prince of a race of frog-people who struggles to regain his kingdom after his throne is usurped; and Spar (\\"Aspara Gus\\" in the Japanese version), an emotionless plant man who can commune with nature and is held captive by a traveling sideshow. An optional character in the form of the immortal sorceress Bleu (\\"Deis\\" in the Japanese version) from the original Breath of Fire may also be recruited. =Story= Breath of Fire II is set in a fantasy world 500 years after the events of the original game. The story opens on Ryu, age 6, who lives in the village of Gate with his sister Yua and father Ganer, a priest for the Church of St. Eva. Years earlier, Ryu's mother disappeared when demons erupted from a hole in a mountain on the outskirts of town, which was eventually blocked by a large dragon who sacrificed its life to stop the invasion. One day after visiting the lifeless dragon near the mountainside, Ryu returns to find his family missing and no one in the village remembers who he is. Believing him to be an orphan, the townsfolk send him to live at the church with Father Hulk, who has apparently been acting pastor for years. It is there that he meets Bow, a fellow orphan who convinces Ryu to run away with him to a big city and live as thieves. Upon leaving the village, the two seek shelter in a cave during a storm, where they encounter an enormous demon named Barubary who claims that Ryu is the \\"Destined Child\\", knocks the two unconscious, and disappears.Barubary: Go ahead.. Ryu! Let me see you open the gate .. destined child .. and .. that is when you will know the strength of God!! Ten years later, Ryu and Bow live together in HomeTown as members of a Rangers guild, who are tasked with finding the lost pet of Mina, princess of the Kingdom of Windia. The two reluctantly complete the task and upon their return, Bow is charged with stealing from a local rich man named Trout. Bow claims he was framed by a mysterious \\"winged thief\\". Both escape the town the following night, and Bow remains in hiding while Ryu leaves to find the real thief and clear his friend's name. Making his way to Coursair, a town with a large coliseum, to gather information, he becomes a challenger in the arena against Katt, the coliseum's most popular fighter. In defeating her, Ryu gains her trust when he reveals the organizer is possessed by a demon. They defeat the demon with the help of Rand, an employee at the Coliseum. After visiting Bow once again, Rand stays behind to help construct the hideout while Ryu and Katt travel back to the scene of the crime. There, they meet Nina, a young girl studying magic. When her younger sister is kidnapped by a gang in an effort to blackmail Nina, Ryu and Katt resolve to help them and ultimately defeat the gang's leader, who is also a demon in disguise. When the trio make their way to Windia, they quickly find themselves expelled from the castle due to Nina's black wings. They meet a trickster named Sten, who accompanies them after Ryu spares him for trying to con them. Upon arrival at the port town of Capitan, Ryu meets a Shaman, who taps into his latent ability to transform into a dragon, revealing him to be a part of the Dragon Clan thought missing for hundreds of years. They also encounter Ray, a wandering priest of St. Eva whom the party assists in rescuing a number of villagers from Capitan's dry well. Afterwards, Bow's hideaway is rebuilt and Rand rejoins the party. Upon traveling to a new continent, the group meets Jean, a frog-prince whose castle of SimaFort has been usurped by an impostor. After Jean fails to best the impostor in a cooking challenge, Ryu and his friends defeat him in his true demonic form. The group finally catches the real thief, a bat-winged girl named Patty, who they turn over to Trout. Bow rejoins the group, but is worried about Patty despite her actions. He and Ryu break into Trout's house at night and find Patty in a secret dungeon, along with several other residents. Trout is also possessed by a demon and engages Ryu and Bow in combat, but is defeated. Suspecting the demon outbreak to be part of a larger problem, the party searches the world for the Grassman Spar, who is said to be able to communicate with plants. Upon rescuing Spar from the clutches of a traveling sideshow, the group consults with the Great Wise Tree and discover that he is losing his memory. He requests that the party acquire the Therapy Pillow from the city of Tunlan ‚Äî a quest that first necessitates retrieving the Famous Flute from Sten's hometown of Highfort ‚Äî so that they can enter his mind to restore it. In doing so, they discover the underlying reason why the people of Gate had forgotten Ryu: A demon named Aruhameru had used dark magic to erase their memories of him and his family, and he is now doing the same to the Great Wise Tree's memories. Once the group vanquishes Aruhameru, they learn that the demon outbreak is linked to Gate, Ryu's hometown where all the trouble started, and that the Church of St. Eva may not be all that it seems. Investigating further, the team joins with a group of rebels who plan to storm the religion's main church located on an island inaccessible by sea, where Rand's mother Daisy has been taken captive. Hoping to use the power of flight, Nina returns to Windia and inquires about the 'mark of the wing', an old relic that will allow her to transform into the Great Bird. After consorting with the spirit of the original Nina from Breath of Fire, Nina plans to undergo a ceremony that will transform her into a bird permanently,Nina (I): ..Congratulations Nina. I'm your .. great great great great .. Grandmother! / Nina (II): ..Grandmother!? / Nina (I): That's right.. I'm your ancestor. but is stopped by her sister Mina who takes her place, sacrificing her humanity. Traveling on Mina, the group makes their way to the church and they sneak inside. It is revealed that the religion is a front for a demon lord who uses the prayers of the people to empower itself. While pursuing the high priest, Ray blocks their path and attacks the party in dragon form, revealing himself as a member of the Dragon Clan. The battle awakens a powerful new dragon form in Ryu, which he uses to vanquish Ray. The party then rescues Daisy, who sacrifices herself in a trap so that Rand can continue fighting. In the bowels of the church, they find Ryu's father Ganer attached to a large energy- draining machine, having been kidnapped by Aruhameru ten years ago. Ryu and his friends rescue him and escape the church as it self-destructs, making their way back to Gate to stop the demons' plot once and for all. In Gate, they meet Father Hulk, the pastor who took over the Gate church years ago after Ganer was imprisoned. In order for Father Hulk to open the seal in the mountain, he needs a member of the Dragon Clan. Ryu and friends are tricked into bringing him the thief Patty, whose heritage reveals her to be Yua, Ryu's sister. Father Hulk then reveals himself as the demon Habaruku, founder of the Church of St. Eva, and Ryu and company slay him. The dragon at the mountain dissipates and transforms into the spirit of a woman, Ryu's mother Valerie, a member of the Dragon Clan who traveled from their hiding place in the mountain years ago and married Ryu's father, later sacrificing herself to save the town. Ryu and his team enter the cave, traveling deep underground to the demon stronghold, where they meet the last remaining members of the Dragon Clan. After gaining the ultimate dragon power of Anfini, Ryu battles Barubary, the demon from his past. After vanquishing him, the party confronts his master, Deathevn, leader of the St. Eva religion revealed to be a remnant of Myria, the mad goddess from the previous game.Elder: It was something that the Goddess left behind in this world. It was like a small scar. It may be called...... the seed of evil. / ......What the evil Goddess left deep underground...... That name was...... \\"Deathevn\\". After unleashing his full strength, Ryu defeats Deathevn and returns home with two possible endings based on whether the player rescued his father from the St. Eva Church - either sacrificing himself like his mother by transforming into a dragon to prevent further demon encroachment, or by having Ganer pilot a floating landmass on top of the mountain and seal it off for good. Development Breath of Fire II was developed by many of the same Capcom employees who worked on the previous game, including producer Tokuro Fujiwara and lead designer Yoshinori Kawano. While the character designs for the original Breath of Fire were conceived by company head of development Keiji Inafune, the cast of Breath of Fire II was created entirely by artist Tatsuya Yoshikawa, who had previously only provided promotional art for the game's predecessor. Unlike the original Breath of Fire, which was licensed to Square Soft for its North American release, the English version of Breath of Fire II was localized and published entirely by Capcom USA. The game was released in North America one year after the Japanese version in December 1995, and would later become the first Breath of Fire title to become available in Europe in April 1996. Three days before the release of the original Breath of Fire on Nintendo's Game Boy Advance in July 2001, Capcom announced that they would similarly port Breath of Fire II to the handheld, with an initial release date some time in 2002. Like the re-release of its predecessor, the handheld version features re-drawn character portraits in menu screens, new still images used in cutscenes throughout the game, and a re-designed battle interface similar to Breath of Fire IV. New features include a dash button that allows players to move through the game faster, as well as an item-sharing system where two players may link together using the Game Boy Advance link cable to exchange items between game cartridges. To celebrate the game's release in December 2001, Capcom of Japan held an art contest for fans to submit artwork featuring characters from the first two Breath of Fire games, with the winner chosen by the Game Boy Advance version's staff. In January 2002, Capcom USA announced that an English version of Breath of Fire II would be heading to North America the following April. A European version would also be released in July 2002, published by Ubisoft. =Audio= While the background music for the original Breath of Fire was composed by four members of Capcom's sound team Alph Lyla, the score for Breath of Fire II was written entirely by series newcomer Yuko Takehara. In January 1995, the Breath of Fire II: Shimei no Ko Original Soundtrack was released in Japan by Sony Records, and featured 28 selected themes from the game on a single disc. A complete musical selection from the title would not be made commercially available until 2006, with the release of the Breath of Fire Original Soundtrack Special Box, which contained all music from the first five games of the series. In order to promote the game, Capcom hired J-pop singer Mio Watanabe to record a theme song that played during the game's television commercial in Japan called \\"Owaranai Ai\\" (ÁµÇ„Çè„Çâ„Å™„ÅÑÊÑõ, lit. Unending Love), which was released as a single in December 1994 by Alfa Records. Reception Breath of Fire II was released the same week as Sony's PlayStation console in Japan, and debuted on Japanese software charts as the seventh highest-selling game of its first week with 89,700 copies. It was given an 8 out of 10 in two separate Reader Cross Reviews printed by Famicom Ts≈´shin,Ë™≠ËÄÖ „ÇØ„É≠„Çπ„É¨„Éì„É•„Éº: „Éñ„É¨„Çπ „Ç™„Éñ „Éï„Ç°„Ç§„Ç¢II. Weekly Famicom Ts≈´shin. No.324.

The game became popular enough to be re-released in the region for the Nintendo Power flash RAM peripheral in September 1997 at a reduced price. Reviews in North America were mixed to positive. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly generally found the game worth getting for its high quality sound and lengthy quest. Though Mark Lefebvre felt the graphics were below average and that the game overall \\"could have been a little better\\", the other three reviewers were more enthusiastic, praising the graphics and the shaman mechanic. GamePros Major Mike was also impressed with the sheer length of the RPG. While remarking that there are very few cinematic scenes compared to the first Breath of Fire, he was pleased with the complexity of both the main story and most of the side quests. He also complimented the graphics and the change to different musical themes halfway through the game, and summarized, \\"This long, absorbing game offers plenty of story turns, intense battles, and intriguing characters.\\" A reviewer for Next Generation said that the game \\"is larger and more involved than its predecessor, but unfortunately also much less interesting. While some parts are very clever (you are able to build your home town, populating it with stray homeless folks you run across), it suffers from too little direction, a purely mechanical storyline, and the clunkiest dialogue since Night Trap.\\" Similar to the original Super Nintendo Entertainment System release, the Game Boy Advance version met with mostly positive reception from critics, with the Japanese version receiving a 29 out of 40 score from Weekly Famitsu magazine. GameSpot compared the game to the previous version, calling it a \\"faithful translation of the SNES game\\" and praised the title's new save feature allowing players to record their progress at any time, but found that its music \\"leans toward the bland side of things\\" and \\"lack[s] personality\\". IGN found the game to be a step up from the first game's Game Boy Advance port, stating that \\"The storyline and characters make Breath of Fire II a much better game than the first adventure in the series...even though the game hasn't changed a whole lot.\\" The website additionally felt that the game's lack of spaces in text fields and shoddy translation hurt the overall presentation, and the graphics were not up to par with games designed initially for the handheld such as Camelot's Golden Sun. GamePro awarded the Game Boy version a perfect score as well as an Editor's Choice Award, stating that the only flaw was the game's low difficulty, declaring that \\"In the realm of today‚Äôs high-powered next-gen role-players, BOFII is an excellent time- killer\\". The game would later be nominated for \\"Best Port of a 16-bit Classic\\" and \\"Best Role-Playing Game on Game Boy Advance\\" in GameSpot's Best and Worst of 2002 Awards. The Game Boy Advance version holds a 75% review average on GameRankings, as well as an 81% average on Metacritic. Breath of Fire IIs Virtual Console release in 2007 met with mixed response. GameSpot called attention to the title's \\"pleasing visual presentation\\" and breadth of content, but found the game's localization to be \\"terrible\\" along with unpolished gameplay mechanics that made it appear to be a \\"hasty, careless effort\\". The game's pacing was also said to be poor, with too many \\"mundane tasks\\" laden throughout the story, recommending it to players who could look past its \\"rough edges\\". IGN called the game's translation \\"average at best\\" with the lack of adequate spacing in text fields still present, yet ultimately calling it a \\"solid, enjoyable RPG experience...though not a role-playing masterpiece on the level of Final Fantasy VI or Chrono Trigger\\". Eurogamer called attention to the game's high rate of random battles, but nonetheless called the game \\"a beautifully crafted and impeccably produced adventure\\". In 2006, Nintendo Power ranked the game 171st in its list of the top 200 games released across all Nintendo consoles, ten places behind the original Breath of Fire.

A VVPAT is intended as an independent verification system for voting machines designed to allow voters to verify that their vote was cast correctly, to detect possible election fraud or malfunction, and to provide a means to audit the stored electronic results. It contains the name of the candidate (for whom vote has been cast) and symbol of the party/individual candidate. The VVPAT offers some fundamental differences as a paper, rather than electronic recording medium when storing votes. A paper VVPAT is readable by the human eye and voters can directly interpret their vote. Computer memory requires a device and software which potentially is proprietary. Insecure voting machineSee page 3 of: records could potentially be changed quickly without detection by the voting machine itself. It would be more difficult for voting machines to corrupt records without human intervention. Corrupt or malfunctioning voting machines might store votes other than as intended by the voter unnoticed. A VVPAT allows voters the possibility to verify that their votes are cast as intended and can serve as an additional barrier to changing or destroying votes. The VVPAT includes a direct recording electronic voting system (DRE), to assure voters that their votes have been recorded as intended. It is intended, and some argue necessary, as a means by which to detect fraud and equipment malfunction. Depending on election laws the paper audit trail may constitute a legal ballot and therefore provide a means by which a manual vote count can be conducted if a recount is necessary. The solution was first demonstrated (New York City, March 2001) and used (Sacramento, CA 2002) by AVANTE International Technology, Inc.. In non- document ballot voting systems - both mechanical voting machines and DRE voting machines - the voter does not have an option to review a tangible ballot to confirm the voting system accurately recorded his or her intent. In addition, an election official is unable to manually recount ballots in the event of a dispute. Because of this, critics claim there is an increased chance for electoral fraud or malfunction and security experts, such as Bruce Schneier, have demanded voter-verifiable paper audit trails. Non-document ballot voting systems allow only a recount of the \\"stored votes\\". These \\"stored votes\\" might not represent the correct voter intent if the machine has been corrupted or suffered malfunction. A fundamental hurdle in the implementation of paper audit trails is the performance and authority of the audit. Paper audit systems increase the cost of electronic voting systems, can be difficult to implement, often require specialized external hardware, and can be difficult to use. In the United States, 27 states require a paper audit trail by statute or regulation for all direct recording electronic voting machines used in public elections.See: Another 18 states do not require them but use them either statewide or in local jurisdictions.Forbes.com: Paper Jams a Problem for Electronic Voting Five US states basically have no paper trail. In India, the voter-verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) system was introduced in 8 of 543 parliamentary constituencies as a pilot project in 2014 Indian general election.http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report-evm-paper-trail- introduced-in-8-of-543-constituencies-1982463http://www.business- standard.com/article/elections-2014/ls-polls-voters-to-get-automated-receipts- at- gandhinagar-114042901134_1.htmlhttp://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/vvpat- machine-to-be-on-demonstration- for-10-days/article5868161.ecehttp://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/vvpat-to- be-introduced-in-jadavpur-constituency-35049.html VVPAT was implemented in Lucknow, Gandhinagar, Bangalore South, Chennai Central, Jadavpur, Raipur, Patna Sahib and Mizoram constituencies.8 seats having VVPAT facilityhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/lok-sabha- elections-2014/news/Patna-Sahib-electorate-can-see-who-they-voted- for/articleshow/33351551.cmshttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/lok-sabha- elections-2014/news/EVM-slip-will-help-verify-your- vote/articleshow/34304320.cmshttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/400-EVMs- on-standby-for-Patna-Sahib- Pataliputra/articleshow/33836327.cmshttp://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/VVPAT- to-Debut-in-B%E2%80%99lore-South/2014/04/04/article2148837.ece Voter- verifiable paper audit trail was first used in an election in India in September 2013 in Noksen (Assembly Constituency) in Nagaland. VVPAT along with EVMs was used on a large-scale for the first time in India, in 10 assembly seats out of 40 in 2013 Mizoram Legislative Assembly election. VVPAT -fitted EVMs was used in entire Goa state in the 2017 assembly elections, which was the first time that an entire state in India saw the implementation of VVPAT. voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) system which enables electronic voting machines to record each vote cast by generating the EVM slip, was introduced in all 543 Lok sabha constituencies in 2019 Indian general election. History VVPAT used with Indian electronic voting machines in Indian Elections When a voter casts a vote on a direct-recording voting machine, the voter \\"has no knowledge through his senses that he has accomplished a result. The most that can be said, is, if the machine worked as intended, then he ... has voted.\\"Horatio Rogers, (19 R.I. 729) opinion of the Justices in re voting machine: dissent. Reports of Cases Argued and Determined in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island, Vol. XIX, E.L. Freeman & Sons, Providence (1898); 732-735, quotation from the bottom of page 734. This observation was made by Horatio Rogers in 1897, and it remains as true with DRE voting machines as it was with the early mechanical voting machines that Rogers spoke about. In 1899, Joseph Gray addressed this problem with a mechanical voting machine that simultaneously recorded votes in its mechanism and punched those votes on a paper ballot that the voter could inspect before dropping it in a ballot box. Gray explained that \\"in this manner, we have a mechanical check for the tickets [ballots], while the ticket is also a check upon the register [mechanical vote counter].\\"Joseph A. Gray, Voting-machine, , issued Mar. 7, 1899; quoted from lines 103-105, page 2. This check is only effective, of course, if there is an audit to compare the paper and mechanical records. The idea of creating a parallel paper trail for a direct-recording voting mechanism remained dormant for a century, until it was rediscovered by Rebecca Mercuri, who suggested essentially the same idea in 1992.Rebecca T. Mercuri, Physical verifiability of computer systems, Proc. 5th International Computer Virus and Security Conference. Reposted on the web with added notes in 2005. The Mercuri method, as some have called it, was refined in her Ph.D. dissertation in October 2000; in her final version, the paper record is printed behind glass so that the voter may not take it or alter it.Rebecca T. Mercuri, A better ballot box, IEEE Spectrum, Oct. 2002; pages 46-50. The first commercial voting systems to incorporate voter verifiable paper audit trail printers were the Avante Vote Trakker and a retrofit to the Sequoia AVC Edge called the VeriVote Printer.Douglas W. Jones and Barbara Simons, Broken Ballots, CSLI Publications, 2012; see Section 5.5, pages 111-115. Avante's system saw its first trial use in 2002, and in 2003, the state of Nevada required the use of VVPAT technology statewide and adopted the Sequoia system. It is notable that, in Avante's design, the shield preventing the voter from taking the paper record was an afterthought, while in Sequoia's design, the paper record for successive voters were printed sequentially on a single roll of paper. Application A Diebold Election Systems AccuVote-TSx DRE voting machine with VVPAT attachment ES&S; DRE voting machine with VVPAT attachment Various technologies can be used to implement a paper audit trail. * Attachment of a printer to direct-recording electronic (DRE) voting machines that print paper records stored within the machine. Such designs usually present the record to the voter behind a transparent surface to enable a voter to confirm a printed record matches the electronic ballot. The records can be manually counted and compared to the electronic vote totals in the event of a dispute. The solution linking electronic ballot images and the voter-verified paper record with randomly generated unique voting session identifier is covered by patents issued and pending. * Attachment of a printer to DRE voting machines that print paper records on special paper with security features. The printed page contains both a plain text record and a simple barcode of the voter's selections. This page is the official ballot that is then fed through a scanner into a locked ballot box so that all originals are saved in case of the need for a recount or audit. The electronic record from the DRE is compared with the barcode scanner record and in case of any discrepancy, the paper ballots are used to determine the official vote, not the electronic record. The voter has the ability to proofread the ballot before it is placed into the scanner/lockbox and have it voided if there is any error, just as has always been possible with existing manual voting systems. * Attachment of a printer to DRE voting machines that print an encrypted receipt that is either retained by the voter or stored within the machine. If the receipt is retained, the receipts can be manually counted and compared to the electronic vote totals in the event of a dispute. These systems have not been used in elections in the United States. * Creation of an encrypted audit trail at the same time the electronic ballot is created in a DRE voting machine, a form of witness system. The audit trail can be accessed and compared to the electronic vote totals in the event of a dispute. * Use of precinct-based optical scan or mark-sense tabulators instead of DREs. In this simple and cost-effective system, voters fill out paper ballots which are then counted electronically by a tabulator at the precinct, similar to the technology used to score standardized tests. Optical scan machines have been in use for decades, and provide a voter-verified audit trail by default. Tabulators can detect overvotes at the poll so that the voter can be given the opportunity to correct a spoiled ballot. Systems that allow the voters to prove how they voted do not conform to the generally accepted definition of voting by secret ballot, as such proof raises the risk of voter intimidation and vote selling. As such, systems that allow such proof are generally forbidden under the terms of numerous international agreements and domestic laws. Professor Avi Rubin has testified in front of the United States House Committee on House Administration in favor of voting systems that use a paper ballot and disfavoring systems that use retrofitted VVPAT attachments. He has said on his personal blog that \\"after four years of studying the issue, I now believe that a DRE with a VVPAT is not a reasonable voting system.\\"Today's Congressional hearing, March 7, 2007 from Avi Rubin's blog An auditable system, such as that provided with VVPAT, can be used in randomized recounts to detect possible malfunction or fraud. With the VVPAT method, the paper ballot can be treated as the official ballot of record. In this scenario, the ballot is primary and the electronic records are used only for an initial count or, in some cases, if the VVPAT is damaged or otherwise unreadable. In any subsequent recounts or challenges the paper, not the electronic ballot, would be used for tabulation. Whenever a paper record serves as the legal ballot, that system will be subject to the same benefits and concerns of any paper ballot system. Matt Quinn, the developer of the original Australian DRE system, believes that in the future there should be a, \\"There's no reason voters should trust a system that doesn't have it, and they shouldn't be asked to. Why on earth should [voters] have to trust me ‚Äì someone with a vested interest in the project's success? A voter-verified audit trail is the only way to 'prove' the system's integrity to the vast majority of electors, who after all, own the democracy.\\" In India, in an instance VVPAT was helpful in resolving an issue pertaining to a tally of votes in Kancheepuram (State Assembly Constituency) in 2016 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election as the number of votes entered in the Form 17C of a polling booth and the total number of votes recorded in the EVM control unit of that booth did not tally. In June 2018, Election Commission of India introduced a built-in-hood on top of the contrast sensor and paper roll that does not soak humidity in all VVPATs to prevent it from excess light and heat. Challenges and concerns with VVPAT =Common problems= Common VVPAT problems are: # Video of voter behavior during an actual election revealed that most voters do not verify their choices by reading the VVPAT. # Research indicates voters who do check ballot summaries overlook discrepancies. # A manual VVPAT recount/audit is labor-intensive and expensive, and likely unaffordable to most candidates seeking it. # And while VVPAT is designed to serve as a check on DRE (Direct Recording Electronic) vote recorders, it relies on the same proprietary programming and electronics to produce the audit trail. Other hurdles in the implementation of paper audit trails include the performance and authority of the audit. Paper audit systems increase the cost of electronic voting systems, can be difficult to implement, often require specialized external hardware, and can be difficult to use. In the United States twenty-seven states require a paper audit trail by statute or regulation for all direct recording electronic voting machines used in public elections. Another eighteen States don't require them, but use them either statewide or in local jurisdictions. =Security concerns= The introduction of malicious software into a VVPAT system can cause it to intentionally misrecord the voter's selections. This attack could minimize detection by manipulating only a small percentage of the votes or for only lesser known races.VVPR Attack with Misprinted VVPAT, David L. Dill October 2, 2003 Another security concern is that a VVPAT could print while no voter is observing the paper trail, a form of ballot stuffing.Paper Trail Manipulation I, Professor Michael Ian Shamos October 5, 2005 Even if additional votes were discovered through matching to the voters list, it would be impossible to identify legitimate ballots from fraudulent ballots. Alternatively the printer could invalidate the printed record after the voter leaves and print a new fraudulent ballot. These ballots would be undetectable as invalidated ballots are quite common during elections.Paper Trail Manipulation II, Professor Michael Ian Shamos October 5, 2005 Also, VVPAT systems that are technically able to reverse the paper feed could be open to manipulated software overwriting or altering the VVPAT after the voter checks it. =Usability and ergonomic concerns= For the voter, the printed record is \\"in a different format than the ballot, in a different place, is verified at a different time, and has a different graphical layout with different contrast and lighting parameters.\\" In November 2003 in Wilton, CT, virtually all voters had to be prompted to find and verify their receipt, increasing the time required to vote and the work for the pollworkers. The VVPAT adds to the complexity of voting, already a deterrent to voting. In addition, a VVPAT component may not be easily usable by poll-workers, many of whom are already struggling with DRE maintenance and use and new elections law requirements. In the 2006 primary election in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, a study found that 9.6 percent of the VVPAT tapes were either destroyed, blank, illegible, missing, taped together or otherwise compromised. In one case the thermal paper was loaded into the printer backwards leaving a blank tape, which was not realized by voters who couldn't verify the paper trail. The Cuyahoga Election Review Panel proposed in its final report to remove the opaque doors covering the VVPAT except the ones equipped with equipment for blind voters. In general collecting and counting these printed records can be difficult. Records printed on continuous rolls of paper is more difficult than counting standard paper ballots or even punch cards. =Privacy concerns= DRE VVPAT systems that print the ballot records out in the order in which they were cast (often known as reel-to-reel systems) raise privacy issues, if the order of voting can also be recorded. VVPAT printers that cut the paper after each ballot to form individual ballots can avoid this concern. If there are multiple voting machines it would be more difficult to match between the full voter list and the VVPATs. Alternatively, an attacker could watch the order in which people use a particular voting system and note the order of each particular vote he is interested in. If that attacker later obtains the paper ballot records she could compare the two and compromise the privacy of the ballot. This could also lead to vote selling and voter intimidation. In 2007, Jim Cropcho and James Moyer executed and publicized a proof of concept for this theory. Via a public records request, the two extracted voter identification from pollbooks, and voter preference from VVPATs, for a Delaware County, Ohio, precinct with multiple voting machines. Because both sets of records independently established the order of electronic ballots cast, they directly linked a voter's identification to his or her preference. Over 1.4 million registered voters in ten Ohio counties were affected. The situation was resolved before the next election by omitting the consecutive numbers on Authority To Vote slips from pollbook records. However, similar vulnerabilities may still exist in other states. =Effectiveness concerns= Also problematic is that voters are not required to actually check the paper audit before casting a ballot, which is critical to \\"verifying\\" the vote. While the option to look at the paper may provide comfort to an individual voter, the VVPAT does not serve as an effective check on malfunction or fraud unless a statistically relevant number of voters participate. =Accessibility concerns= Current VVPAT systems are not usable by some disabled voters. Senator Christopher Dodd (D-CT) testified before the United States Senate Committee on Rules and Administration at a June 2005 hearing on Voter Verification in Federal Elections \\"The blind cannot verify their choices by means of a piece of paper alone in a manner that is either independent or private. Nor can an individual who has a mobility disability, such as hand limitations, verify a piece of paper alone, if that individual is required to pick up and handle the paper.\\"Hearing on Voter Verification in Federal Elections, 109th Cong. (2005). testimony of Senator Christopher Dodd. Retrieved February 3, 2007, from Senate Rules website. =Reliability concerns= VVPAT systems can also introduce increased concern over reliability. Professor Michael Shamos points out that \\"Adding a paper printing device to a DRE machine naturally adds another component that can fail, run out of ink, jam or run out of paper. If DREs are alleged already to be prone to failure, adding a paper trail cannot improve that record.\\" In Brazil in 2003, where a small number of precincts had installed paper trails, failure of the printers delayed voters by as much as 12 hours, a figure that would be catastrophic in the U.S.Mira, Leslie, \\"For Brazil Voters, Machines Rule,\\" Wired News, January 24, 2004. Current implementation of VVPAT systems use thermal printers to print their paper ballot records. Ballot records printed on the thermal paper will fade with time. Also, heat applied to the paper before or after the election can destroy the printing. =Implementation concerns= It can be significantly more difficult to implement a VVPAT as an after-the-fact feature. For jurisdictions currently using direct recording electronic voting machines that lack a VVPAT, implementation can be expensive to add and difficult to implement due to the specialized external hardware required. To add a VVPAT component to a DRE machine, a jurisdiction would be required to purchase the system designed by the vendor of the DRE machine with a no bid, sole source purchase contract. That assumes the vendor has designed a component that is compatible with the DRE machine in use. The vendor may not have developed a VVPAT component that is compatible with the DRE machine in use, thus requiring the jurisdiction to purchase an entirely new voting system. For jurisdictions not currently using direct recording electronic voting machines, the introduction of a new voting system that includes a VVPAT component would have less implementation challenges. Some implementations of the VVPAT place a high cognitive burden on the voter and are extraordinarily error prone.Warren, Stewart. VoteTrustUSA. Eminent Computer Scientist Criticizes ES&S; \\"Real Time Audit Log\\". June 21, 2006. Legal questions One important question of VVPAT systems is regarding the time of the audit. Some have suggested that random audits of direct recording electronic voting machines be performed on Election Day to protect against machine malfunction. However, the partial tallying of votes before the polls have closed could create a problem similar to the occurrence in American national elections where a winner is declared based on East Coast results long before polls have closed on the West Coast. In addition, the partial tallying of votes before the polls have closed may be illegal in some jurisdictions. Others have suggested that random audits of direct recording electronic voting machines be performed after the election or only in the event of a dispute. In the event an audit is performed after the election and a discrepancy is discovered between the ballot count and the audit count it is unclear which count is the authoritative count. Some jurisdictions have statutorily defined the ballot as the authoritative count leaving the role of an audit in question. Because VVPAT is a recent addition to direct record voting systems the authority question remains unclear.

Practical experience shows no organization is ever completely rule-bound: instead, all real organizations represent some mix of formal and informal. Consequently, when attempting to legislate for an organization and to create a formal structure, it is necessary to recognize informal organization in order to create workable structures.

At first this discovery was dismissed as the product of avoidable errors, until it finally had to be recognized that these unwritten laws of work of everyday life often had more influence on the fate of the enterprise than those conceived on organizational charts of the executive level. Numerous empirical studies in sociological organization research followed, ever more clearly providing evidence for this, particularly during the human relations movement. It is important to analyze informal structures within an enterprise to make use of positive innovations, but also to be able to do away with bad habits that have developed over time. Reasons for informal organization There are many different reasons for informal organization: *Informal standards: personal goals and interests of workers differ from official organizational goals. *Informal communication: changes of communication routes within an enterprise due to personal relations between coworkers. *Informal group: certain groups of coworkers have the same interests, or (for example) the same origin. *Informal leaders: due to charisma and general popularity, certain members of the organization win more influence than originally intended. *Different interests and preferences of coworkers. *Different status of coworkers. *Difficult work requirements. *Unpleasant conditions of work. Managerial organization theory often still regards informal organization as rather disturbing, but sometimes helpful. In the opinion of systems theory and cybernetics, however, formal organization fades into the background and only serves, if necessary, to supplement or to correct. Changes in structure always redevelop because of the conduct and differences among coworkers, and the ability of self-organization is recognized as a natural characteristic of a social system.

He is thought to have initially studied as an architect under his father's first cousin, Sir John Vanbrugh. He is best known for the Irish Houses of Parliament in Dublin, and his work on Castletown House. The architectural concepts he employed on both civic and private buildings were to change the face of architecture in Ireland. He could be described as the father of Irish Palladian architecture and Georgian Dublin.  Early life  Edward Lovett Pearce was born about 1699 in County Meath and was the only child of General Edward Pearce, a first cousin of the architect Sir John Vanbrugh, and Frances, daughter of Christopher Lovett, Lord Mayor of Dublin 1676‚Äì77 and previously a merchant in Turkey. In that same year Vanbrugh was beginning work on his first great architectural commission of Castle Howard which was the first truly baroque house in England, ironically Vanbrugh's new cousin was to be one of the leading architects whose designs were to overthrow the baroque fashion less than 28 years later. In 1715 following the death of his father, Pearce became a pupil of his eminent architect cousin, it is therefore likely that Pearce would have had the opportunity to see first hand and study the plans and building of Blenheim Palace, where work, following the death of Queen Anne, had just restarted, and was midway through its fraught and frequently interrupted construction. It seems though, that at this age Pearce was still uncertain if he wanted an architectural career, as aged 17 he joined the army serving as a cornet in the dragoons under the command of a Colonel Morris. Following his time in the army, he decided circa 1722, to return to his first career and again began to study architecture, he did this by studying the architectural masterpieces of France and Italy. However it was in the Veneto that he found the style of architecture which was to influence him most. He made detailed drawings of many of the great villas designed by Palladio which were to serve as the inspiration for his later work. He met in Italy the Florentine architect Alessandro Galilei, who was working from afar on a vast grandiose mansion near Dublin ‚Äì Castletown. About 1725 Edward married Ann, his own first-cousin, daughter of General Thomas Pearce and Mary Hewes. They were to have four daughters who inherited great-grandfather Pearce's manor of Whitlingham by Norwich, Norfolk. Mary, Mrs Lewis Thomas then Mrs James Slator but mother of Major-General Lewis Thomas; Anne, Mrs Chambre Hallowes; Frances, Mrs Benjamin Lake and Henrietta, Mrs Charles Willington. He remained a Captain in Colonel Clement Neville's Dragoons.Blackburne Hamilton, Historical Record of the 14th King's Hussars 1715‚Äì1900, Longman's Green, London 1901  Architectural career  By 1724, Pearce had returned to Ireland to become a practising architect in Dublin, It would appear that as the only Irish architect, at the time, to have studied in Italy, his classical concepts were to win him instant recognition, his architectural success seems to have been almost instantaneous; no doubt helped by his contacts and position in Irish society and even more undoubtedly by his association with William Conolly and Castletown.  Castletown  Castletown House Castletown House is the largest and one of the most important country houses in Ireland, it also claims to be the house which introduced Palladianism to Ireland. The mansion was commissioned by William Conolly (1662‚Äì1729), a self-made man who had risen from humble origins through astute property dealings to become one of the wealthiest and influential men in Ireland. The original plans were drawn by Alessandro Galilei circa 1718, the new mansion was intended to reflect Connoly's political power as Lord Justice of Ireland. Galilei though returned to Italy in 1719, having drawn the plans, but not waiting to see building on the Castletown site commence. In fact work was not to start until 1722. For two years, the project seems to have continued unsupervised, until in 1724, it was taken over by the twenty-five- year-old Edward Lovett Pearce. Just returned to Ireland from Italy, it is likely that Pearce had been working on the plans with Galilei there. Hence Pierce's connection with Castletown probably predates his return to Ireland. It is possible that it was to oversee the building of Castletown that provided Pearce with the impetus to return home to Ireland. Building at Castletown was to continue for the rest of Pearce's life. It is not known precisely how much of Castletown is Galilei's work and how much Pearce's. If in Italy Pearce had been employed by Galilei and worked on the plans, then, as was the custom of the time, Pearce's work as an employee would have been credited to his master. Galilei was certainly responsible for devising the overall scheme of a principal centre mansion, flanked by colonnades leading to two service wings, in the true Palladian manner. Castletown was the first house in Ireland designed with this layout. The rigid symmetry of Castletown's classical facades, designed by Galilei was to be typical too of Pearce's later work. Bellamont House The interiors and final room plans are believed to be the work of Pearce, however the long suite of reception rooms along the ground-floor garden front, are not in the strict palladian tradition. Such a mansion as Castletown, in Italy, would have been a town Palazzo rather than a country villa. The long suite of room with a central salon, terminating with smaller rooms at the end of the enfilade is more typical of the suites of state rooms in English country houses at the time. The central saloon at Castletown opens into the two-storey entrance hall, which is traversed by a corridor running the length of the mansion; the principal staircase is situated in an adjoining hall to the side of the great hall. In this layout of state rooms, hall and staircase Castletown is similar to Blenheim Palace, which Pearce had studied while a student of Vanbrugh. (While Pearce designed the staircase it was not actually constructed until 1760, some 28 years after his death.)  Bellamont  Another of Pearce's earliest commissions occurred when he was commissioned by his mother's brother-in-law Thomas Coote to build Bellamont House, also known as Bellamont Forest, on the outskirts of Cootehill in the north-east of County Cavan.On marrying his third wife, Ann Lovett, in 1697, Thomas Coote became the uncle-in-law of Edward Lovett Pearce. This family connection was not unusual, as several of Pearce's clients were related to him.Maurice Craig, 'Pearce, Sir Edward Lovett (1699?‚Äì1733)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 18 Jan 2013 Like Castletown, Bellamont claims to be Ireland's first Palladian house. Dates attributed to the design range from 1725‚Äì1730, whatever the date (1725 is probable) it is almost certain that this was the first of Ireland's many palladian houses to be completed. The four bays square modestly sized mansion is clearly inspired by Palladio's Villa Capra. The principal facade has as its ground floor a rusticated semi-basement, above which is the piano nobile at the centre is a four columned portico with a pediment, the portico is flanked by a single high sash window on each side. The main entrance beneath the one story portico is reached by a single flight of broad steps. Above the piano nobile is a secondary floor with windows exactly half the size of those below. The entire facade is just four windows wide. The composition is a hybrid between the grandest of the Veneto's villas and a slightly exalted farmhouse, which ironically was the very intention of Palladio's original designs 200 years previously. While Castletown is a symbol or wealth and power, the far smaller Bellamont is the greater symbol of palladianism and architectural perfection. Also during this period of his work Pearce redesigned the south elevation of Drumcondra House (now All Hallows College, Dublin).  Stillorgan Obelisk  The upper portion of the obelisk Following a famine in 1727, an Obelisk at Stillorgan, attributed to Pearce, was erected as a memorial to those who had perished. This granite monument, over 100 feet high, contains in its base a large vaulted hall from which rises a staircase leading to a viewing platform. The attribution to Pearce is probable, although the monument is in an almost avante garde neoclassical style, with Egyptian influences; however Pearce was living in the parish at this time in a house known as The Grove. This large house (subsequently known as Tigh Lorcain Hall) was replaced by the Stillorgan Bowling Alley in 1963.  Irish Parliament House  In 1727, Pearce was elected Member of Parliament in the Irish House of Commons for the Ratoath in County Meath, assisted by his patron Speaker Conolly , for whom he was continuously working at Castletown. The Irish Government had decided in that same year to replace their existing meeting place at Chichester House, College Green, Dublin with a new purpose built parliament building. It was Speaker Conolly who first suggested building the new Parliament House on College Green, therefore it is unsurprising, perhaps, that it was Pearce the Member of Parliament (MP) and employee of Connoly who was eventually chosen to design the project. Drawing of the front of Parliament House, Dublin with the dome, seen from the street-level, in the 18th century The foundation stone of the new Parliament building was laid in 1729, the palladian design was, as intended, awe inspiring with a huge colonnade facing onto College Green. The two legislator Houses of Parliament contained an octagonal classical temple, complete with pantheon style dome, as its House of Commons, (destroyed by fire in 1792). The public gallery here could hold up to 700 spectators, symbolising true open government; the smaller but still exquisite House of Lords survives, along with its central arcade and pediment. The building at the beginning of the 19th century was taken over by the Bank of Ireland, substantial alterations have been made since, including a large extension by Gandon and Johnson. A condition of the sale to the bank was that all signs of Parliament were to be removed. However, the concepts of Pearce are still very evident in the surviving House of Lords.  Cashel Palace  As architect of the Parliament building, in 1730Dublin, 19 Jan 1731 \\"We hear that the Letters Patent are passing the Great Seal of this Kingdom, containing a Commission from his Majesty, constituting and appointing Capt. Pearce, Nephew to General Pearce, a Gentleman of Great Abilities and Experience, to be Engineer and Surveyor-General of his Majesty's Forts and Buildings in the Kingdom of Ireland, in the room of Thomas Burgh, Esq; deceased.\\" News London Evening Post, 2 February 1731 ‚Äì 4 February 1731; Issue 440 Pearce was appointed Surveyor General of Ireland, he succeeded Thomas Burgh. This important position, a mere four years after his return from Italy was the seal on his success. While work was continuing on the parliament building in 1730 Pierce, now Ireland's most famed and sought after architect, was commissioned by Archbishop Theophilus Bolton to build the new bishop's palace, at Cashel, in County Tipperary. The result was a large unostentatious red brick palladian mansion, on two principal floors, the hipped roof hidden by a brick pediment, the main facade seven bays long had at its centre a three bayed projection, the only ornament was dressed stone double strapping indicating the ground and first floor division. On the ground floor the terminating two bays were replaced by venetian windows. The result was a house of restrained refinement. Pearce also designed the landscaping of the grounds of the palace complete with their private path to Rock of Cashel.  Legacy  Henrietta Street ‚Äì one of Dublin's oldest Georgian streets, Edward Lovett Pearce is known to have designed at least two of the houses here. Following the acclaim given to the new Parliament building, the structure was near enough completed in 1731 for Parliament to be held there, in 1732 Pearce was knighted, this honour was followed by the freedom of the city of Dublin in 1733. Sir Edward Lovett Pearce was then at the height of his success and popularity. In addition to the better known works described above Pearce worked on numerous other commissions, a vast mansion known at Summerhill House in County Meath (demolished in the 1950s) was attributed to him, although his contemporary, the architect Richard Cassels is thought to have overseen this work. Pearce also designed smaller and more modest town houses for the wealthy and aristocratic of Dublin; two examples of his work survive in Henrietta Street (illustrated right). His design at No.9 was for his first cousin Mrs Thomas Carter. Tragically it was to be a short period, within weeks of receiving the freedom of Dublin, he was struck down with an abscess and died of septicaemia 16 November 1733 at his home, The Grove, Stillorgan, aged just 34. His remains were buried 10 December 1733 in St Mary's Graveyard, Donnybrook. His widow and four children survived him. Ann died at her house in St Stephen's Green Dublin 15 July 1749 and was buried at Donnybrook 17 July 1749. Edward Lovett Pearce's rise had been meteoric, in just six years of architectural practice he had scaled the highest heights of both private and civic architectural practice. He had introduced palladianism to a country which was to adopt it, with a gusto unlike any other European country. At the time of his death he presided over an entire community of palladian architects perpetuating his interpretations of Palladio's work throughout Ireland.

The recreation park which was established in 1985 is approximately from Adelaide city centre. It is the venue for recreational activities such as walking, canoeing, kayaking, recreational fishing and picnics. Description The recreation park occupies the majority of the portion of the river's catchment area between Main South Road near Old Noarlunga in the east and Commercial and Saltfleet Roads at Port Noarlunga in the west. The occupied land is located within the following suburbs in the City of Onkaparinga: Noarlunga Downs, Port Noarlunga South and Seaford Meadows. A combined pedestrian/cycle track known as the Coast to Vines Rail Trail has an easement that passes through the recreation park on its east side following the alignment of the former Willunga railway line. The Seaford railway line passes over the recreation park on a elevated bridge (known as the Onkaparinga Valley Bridge) which was built between 2011 and 2014. It is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area. History Most of the land now dedicated to the recreation park was purchased in the period 1973 to 1977 by a former SA government agency, the State Planning Authority. The purpose of the land acquisition which included land along the full length of Onkaparinga River was threefold. Firstly, it was ‚Äòto provide open space for recreational purposes‚Äô, secondly, ‚Äòto preserve the natural character of the landscape, including the native flora and fauna‚Äô and thirdly, ‚Äòto function as a buffer between areas of urban and rural land.‚Äô In 1982, the majority of the land was transferred to the then Department for Environment and Heritage which established the recreation park in 1985. In 1993, all of the land east of Main South Road (known as the gorge section‚Äô) was reclassified as the Onkaparinga River National Park. For managerial and administrative purposes, the recreation park and the national park are known collectively as the ‚ÄòOnkaparinga River Reserve‚Äô. Prior use of the land =Aboriginal use= As of 2004, radiocarbon dating of material recovered via archaeological excavation from known Aboriginal sites in the river's estuary suggest continuous use of the land prior to European colonisation for as long ago as 7,500 years BP. =European use= Land in the locality including the Onkaparinga floodplain was surveyed and became available for selection in February 1839. Most of the land in the recreation park was a farm originally purchased about 1861 by John Jared, an immigrant who arrived from Lincolnshire, England. The original purchase of was expanded to . Jared named the farm ‚ÄòClear Farm‚Äô and built a house on the property in 1862. Jared was succeeded in 1871 by his son, John William, who renamed the property ‚ÄòPringle Farm‚Äô. The property remained in the Jared family until the 1970s when it was purchased by the State Planning Authority. The remains of Pringle Farm which was listed on the South Australian Heritage Register on 11 April 1996 are conserved within the recreation park. Recreational uses The recreation park features a system of walking tracks. Two are named and signposted: the Wetlands Walk on the north side of the river and the Pringle Farm Walk on the south side of the river. Canoeing, kayaking and recreational fishing is permitted in the waters of the Onkaparinga River within the recreation park's boundaries. Dogs are permitted in the recreation park, but must be kept on a leash at all times. Vehicle parking areas, toilets and a picnic ground are provided both within the recreation park and just outside its boundaries. A recreational airfield of length which is known as the Old Noarlunga Airfield is located in the south east corner of the recreation park. It is leased by two organisations, the South Coast Flying Club Inc and the Noarlunga Model Aero Sports Inc, for flying respectively vintage aircraft and model aircraft. Associated protected areas The full extent of the River Onkaparinga from the recreational park's eastern boundary at Old Noarlunga to its western boundary at Port Noarlunga is part of both the Port Noarlunga Reef Aquatic Reserve and the Encounter Marine Park. With respect to the aquatic reserve, the only permitted fishing activity is ‚Äòline fishing and hand net fishing for bait shrimp only‚Äô.

He is known as a hard working, defensive midfielder. He is now working as the CEO of HJK Helsinki.  Club career  Riihilahti started his career at HJK where he made his Veikkausliiga debut in 1995. He has won the Finnish championship four times (1997, 2009, 2010 and 2011), the Finnish Cup three times with HJK, and the Finnish League Cup three times, and played a vital part when the first and so far only time Finnish Club team qualified for the UEFA Champions League in the 1998‚Äì99 season. After first spell in HJK, Riihilahti then moved to Norway's V√•lerenga I.F. for the 1999 season. After two seasons in Norway, he joined England's Crystal Palace in 2001, eventually becoming a fans' favourite at the club. In Palace's 2004‚Äì05 Premier League season he showed he has what it takes to play in one of Europe's top leagues. Riihilahti was so loved by the Crystal Palace faithful that a Finnish flag with the legend 'AKI 15' across the centre was hung behind one of the Selhurst Park goals for the entire Premier League season. However, his next season, back in the Championship, following Palace's relegation, was not so successful because injuries limited his chances. Despite not playing for most of his last season with Palace, Riihilahti has a place in club Hall of Fame as he used to hold the club record for gaining the most caps for his country whilst at Palace. After his contract with Palace expired in the summer of 2006, Riihilahti was picked up by 1. FC Kaiserslautern on a one-year deal. In June 2007, Riihilahti signed a two and a half-year deal with Stockholm club Djurg√•rdens IF and on 31 July 2009 returned to Finland to sign with HJK in which he has made a crucial contribution in club's record 5 consecutive championships 2009‚Äì2013. On 29 October 2011, Riihilahti celebrated his 100th league match for HJK by scoring once, in the last match of the season, in a 5‚Äì2 home win against Haka, and retired after club won a convincing double that season. Riihilahti was appointed and has done a good turnaround job for HJK's home stadium as the CEO of Sonera Stadium, as well as coach for HJK's reserves, Klubi-04. In December 2013 he was appointed as the CEO of HJK.  International career  Riihilahti made his debut for the Finnish national team on 5 February 1998 against Cyprus. He was a regular for Finland for most of the 2000s, and earned 69 caps scoring 11 goals.  Personal  Riihilahti has also become something of a cult figure because of columns he writes for newspapers, such as The Times and the Finnish Iltalehti.

It is primarily a residential suburb, with shopping and business districts as well as the main campus of the University of Cape Town. History Four years after the first Dutch settlement at the Cape in 1652, the first experimental crops were grown along the banks of the Liesbeek River (at that stage called the Amstel or Versse Rivier). On the banks of the river, a circular grove of thorn trees, or Ronde Doorn Bosje, was turned into a kraal. In 1657, the first group of Dutch East India Company employees gained \\"free burgher\\" (free citizen) status and were granted land along the river in the area now known as Rondebosch. Geography Rondebosch lies between the slopes of Devil's Peak in the west and the M5 freeway in the east; it is one of the Southern Suburbs of Cape Town, which lie along the eastern slope of the Table Mountain massif. The suburb's western border with the Table Mountain National Park is defined by the M3 freeway. To the north are the suburbs of Rosebank and Mowbray, while to the south are Newlands and Claremont. The eastern border of Rondebosch is the M5 freeway; beyond the freeway are Sybrand Park, Athlone and Rondebosch East. The Southern Line railway divides Rondebosch in two; the only road within Rondebosch that crosses the railway is the Belmont Road bridge. Main Road (the M4) runs north-south through the area west of the railway, while Campground Road runs in the same direction east of the railway. The third north-south through route is Milner Road, further east close to the M5. The area around the intersection of Main Road and Belmont Road is Rondebosch's main commercial area, with several small shopping malls and two supermarkets. Also located in this area is Rondebosch railway station, which is the main public transport facility in the suburb. A smaller commercial area lies just to the east on the corner of Belmont and Campground Roads; there is also a row of shops along Belvedere Road in the southeastern part of the suburb. The rest of the suburb is used for educational and residential purposes, with the residential areas being generally denser further to the west where the influence of the University of Cape Town is felt. Two canalised streams run from the slopes of Table Mountain through Rondebosch; the Liesbeeck River runs northwards between Main Road and the railway, while the Black River runs in a northeasterly direction through the eastern part of the suburb. The terrain is generally flat east of the railway line, while to the west it slopes upwards towards Devil's Peak. =Landmarks= A street scene of Main Road Rondebosch, Cape Town around the turn of the 20th century. The recently installed Rondebosch Fountain can be seen to the left in the foreground. On the slopes of Devil's Peak above Rondebosch is the main campus of the University of Cape Town. The historic Groote Schuur estate in Rondebosch includes presidential and ministerial residences with Cape Dutch origins. The Groote Schuur building is the biggest, rebuilt by Cecil Rhodes according to a design by Herbert Baker after a fire in 1896. The presidential residence, Genadendal (formerly Westbrooke), also dates back to Cape Dutch times. The home of Simon van der Stel (first governor of the Cape Colony) is now part of Rustenburg Junior School. This building dates back to the 17th century, although it has undergone many alterations over the years. Its summer house, dating from 1760, remains as a monument just below the university. Other historic buildings in the area include the Rondebosch Town Hall, now occupied by the Rondebosch Library, and St. Paul's Church, which was designed by Charles Collier Michell. Rondebosch Common, once a military campground, is a national monument and an important fynbos conservation area. The Baxter Theatre in Rondebosch is Cape Town's second biggest theatre complex, after the Artscape Theatre Centre in the city centre.  Rondebosch Fountain  The historic centre of Rondebosch is the Main Road, with the Victorian cast iron Rondebosch Fountain being a historic landmark. Originally known as the Moodie Fountain, it was one of South Africa's first electric streetlights. It was built by the Saracen Foundry in Glasgow and presented to the community by George Moodie as a gift in 1891. The lamp was first turned on, on 25 April 1892 and was initially powered by Moodie's private power plant until a municipal power plant on the Liesbeeck River was completed. The fountain was destroyed in a road accident in 2015 but is being rebuilt. Government and politics Rondebosch is in the City of Cape Town municipality, within the Protea Sub-Council (Sub-Council 20). The eastern part of the suburb is within ward 58 and the ward councillor is Sharon Cottle, and the western part is in ward 59 with councillor Ian Iversen, both members of the Democratic Alliance. Rondebosch was the parliamentary seat of Sir De Villiers Graaff, the leader of the opposition United Party, and later that of Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, leader of the opposition Progressive Federal Party. Education The western part of Rondebosch is dominated by the main campus of the University of Cape Town. Rondebosch is also notable for a high density of schools. Originally the Rondebosch Town Hall the Rondebosch Public Library is a notable landmark in the neighbourhood. Sports and recreation Western Province Cricket Club is the largest sports facility in Rondebosch, catering for many different sports, including tennis and hockey. The University itself has facilities for most sports. Other facilities include Rondebosch Golf Club and Rygersdal Football Club. Next door to Rondebosch is Newlands, home to the Newlands Stadium for rugby and soccer, and Newlands Cricket Ground. Parks in Rondebosch include Keurboom Park and Rondebosch Park. Rondebosch Common is also a popular recreational area. Demographics According to the 2011 census, 14,591 people live in Rondebosch. 62.7% described themselves as \\"White\\", 16.5% as \\"Black African\\", 9.6% as \\"Coloured\\" and 6.1% as \\"Indian or Asian\\". The predominant language is English, which is the first language of 84.3% of the population. 7.6% speak Afrikaans and 1.8% speak Xhosa. In the second half of the 20th Century, Rondebosch was a whites-only area in terms of the Group Areas Act, an Apartheid law that enforced segregation.

After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the area was annexed by the newly created German Empire in 1871 by the Treaty of Frankfurt and became a Reichsland. The German Army decided to build a fortress line from Mulhouse to Luxembourg to protect their new territories. The centerpiece of this line was the Moselstellung between Metz and Thionville, in Lorraine.Clayton Donnell (2008), The German Fortress of Metz 1870‚Äì1944, Osprey Publishing. Overview The fortifications around Metz consisted of casemates, concrete barracks, infantry strong points, and concrete batteries, equipped with rotating steel turrets (100‚Äì150 mm). Each position was surrounded by several ditches, or concrete trenches, with shelters and observation cupolas. A large barbed wire belt, defended by machine gun and rifle positions, completed the defensive system. Forts had usually several large blockhouse style barracks. These had 3-meter thick reinforced concrete roofs with 2-meter thick walls. They were partially buried under as much as of compacted earth. Tunnels connected all of the structures. The fort also had deep wide trenches, some as much as in both dimensions. They were also surrounded by a thick layer of barbed wire entanglements. Each fort had 2‚Äì4 batteries, equipped with hydraulic rotating steel turrets (100‚Äì150 mm). In the summer of 1944, only 10% of the batteries were fully operational. Most of those were in Fort Driant (Feste Kronprinz) and Fort Jeanne d'Arc (Feste Kaiserin). By November, during the battle of Metz, the German troops had managed to get about 50% of the guns operational in most of the forts listed below. These batteries were lacking range tables, missing sights and other equipment to make the guns fully operational. Below is a list of the fortifications that exist around the area of Metz. Because they switched hands quite often, the French names are listed as well as any applicable German ones. In parentheses is the construction period.  Forts of the first belt  The first, inner belt of fortifications were completed by the French just prior to the Franco-Prussian War and were in service during the Siege of Metz from 3 September to 23 October 1870. The forts were in a ring approximately 4 km out from the city center, and were (anti-clockwise from the south): Fort de Plappeville / Fort Alvensleben, September 7, 1940 * Fort de Saint-Privat (1870) / Fort Prinz August von W√ºrttemberg (1872‚Äì1875) * Fort de Queuleu (1867‚Äì1870) / Fort Goeben (1871‚Äì1890) * Fort des Bordes (1870) / Fort Zatrow (1874‚Äì1875) * Fort de Saint-Julien (1867‚Äì1870) / Fort Manteuffel (1871‚Äì1891) * Fort Gambetta / Fort Hindersin (1879‚Äì1881) * Fort D√©roul√®de / Fort Kameke (1876‚Äì1879) * Fort Decaen / Fort Schwerin (1878‚Äì1880) * Fort de Plappeville (1867‚Äì1870) / Fort Alvenslebenn (1871‚Äì1891) * Groupe fortifi√© du Mont Saint- Quentin (1867‚Äì1870) / Feste Prinz Friedrich-Karl (1872‚Äì1892) ** Fort Diou (1867‚Äì1870) / Ostfort (1872‚Äì1892) ** Fort Girardin / Fort Mannstein (1872‚Äì1892)  Forts of the second belt  The second, outer belt of fortifications were completed by the Germans prior to the First World War but saw little service. Prior to the Second World War they were incorporated by the French into the Maginot Line defenses, but again saw little action. In October 1944, while occupied by the Germans, the fortifications were assaulted and captured by the American 3rd Army in the Battle of Metz. The forts were in an offset ring from 8‚Äì10 km from the city, and were (anticlockwise from the south): Fort l‚ÄôAisne (Feste Wagner), 1904-1912 * Fort l‚ÄôAisne / Feste Wagner (1904‚Äì1912) * Fort l‚ÄôYser / Feste Prinzregent Luitpold (1907‚Äì1914) * Fort La Marne / Feste Generalfeldmarschall Freiherr von der Goltz (1907‚Äì1916) (anticlockwise from the north): * Fort Lorraine / Feste Lothringen (1899‚Äì1905) * Fort Fran√ßois de Guise / Feste Leipzig (1907‚Äì1912) * Fort Jeanne d'Arc / Feste Kaiserin (1899‚Äì1905) * Fort Driant / Feste Kronprinz (1899‚Äì1905) * Fort Verdun / Feste Haeseler (1899‚Äì1905), sometimes referred to as Feste Graf Haeseler  The \\"seven dwarves\\"  These are a series of small defensive emplacements built between 1912 and 1916 in a line between Driant and Jeanne d'Arc. The name for them was created by the Americans of the U.S. Third Army during the Battle of Metz in the Second World War. They are sometimes (mistakenly) referred to as forts, and their name alludes to their weak defensive strength.

These responsibilities include identifying and examining critical errors or omissions, and acting as a liaison to the public. Most commonly, public editors perform this work through a regular feature on a newspaper's editorial page. Because public editors are generally employees of the very newspaper they're criticizing, it may appear as though there is a possibility for bias. However, a newspaper with a high standard of ethics would not fire a public editor for a criticism of the paper; the act would contradict the purpose of the position and would itself be a very likely cause for public concern. Many major newspapers in the U.S. use the public editor column as the voice for their ombudsman, though this is not always so. Public editor columns cover a broader scope of issues and do not have an accreditation process, while in order to qualify as an ombudsman of any standing one must be a member of the Organisation of News Ombudsmen. The first newspaper to appoint an ombudsman was Tokyo's Asahi Shimbun in 1922; the first American newspapers to appoint a public editor were the Louisville Courier-Journal and Louisville Times in 1967. At The New York Times, the position was created in response to the Jayson Blair scandal. The Times' first public editor was Daniel Okrent, whose background was primarily in book publishing; Okrent held the position from December 2003 through May 2005. Over the next twelve years, five persons in succession held the position, but then on May 31, 2017, the Times announced that it was eliminating the public editor position.

She was built by John Brown and Company of Clydebank, Scotland, and launched in 1913. Tiger was the most heavily armoured battlecruiser of the Royal Navy at the start of the First World War, but was not yet ready for service. The ship was assigned to the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron (1st BCS) for the duration of the war and participated in the Battle of Dogger Bank in early 1915, though she was still shaking down and did not perform well. Tiger next participated in the Battle of Jutland in 1916, where she was only lightly damaged despite suffering many hits by German shells. Apart from providing distant cover during the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight in 1917, she spent the rest of the war on uneventful patrols in the North Sea. Tiger was the oldest battlecruiser retained by the Royal Navy after the tonnage limits of the Washington Naval Treaty came into effect in 1922. She became a gunnery training ship in 1924 and then joined the Battlecruiser Squadron in 1929 when its flagship, , underwent a lengthy refit. Upon Hoods return to service in 1931, Tiger was decommissioned and sold for scrap in 1932 in accordance with the terms of the London Naval Treaty of 1930. In his book, The Price of Admiralty, British military historian John Keegan described her as \\"certainly the most beautiful warship in the world then, and perhaps ever[.]\\"Keegan, p. 132 Design and description Tiger was the sole battlecruiser authorised in the 1911‚Äì12 Naval Programme. According to naval historian Siegfried Breyer, a sister ship named Leopard was considered in the 1912‚Äì13 Programme and deferred until 1914 as a sixth member of the ,Breyer, p. 135 but there is no record of any additional battlecruiser being provided for in any naval estimates before 1914.Brown, p. 60 Tiger had an overall length of , a beam of , and a mean draught of at deep load. She normally displaced and at deep load. Although Tiger was only longer and wider than the previous battlecruiser, , she displaced almost more than the older ship. She had a metacentric height of at deep load.Roberts 1997, pp. 43, 45 In September 1914, her complement consisted of 1,112 officers and ratings; in April 1918, they totalled 1,459. =Propulsion= Tiger had two paired sets of Brown-Curtis direct-drive steam turbines housed in separate engine-rooms. Each set consisted of high-pressure ahead and astern turbines driving an outboard shaft and low-pressure ahead and astern turbines, housed in the same casing, driving an inner shaft.Roberts 1978, p. 88 Her three-bladed propellers were in diameter.Roberts 1997, p. 76 The turbines were powered by 39 Babcock & Wilcox water-tube boilers in five boiler rooms at a working pressure of .Burt 1986, p. 212 The turbines were designed to produce a total of and a maximum of when forced, but only achieved during her sea trials, although she managed to exceed her maximum designed speed of by over a knot.Roberts 1997, pp. 76, 80 The ship's fuel stowage capacity was of fuel oil and of coal, giving a total fuel supply of ‚Äîmuch more than Queen Marys total of . The sole (unofficial) figure for Tigers daily fuel consumption of a day at Parkes, p. 556 would have given a maximum endurance of . The equivalent figure for Queen Mary was roughly .Roberts 1978, p. 11 Four direct current electric dynamos with a total capacity of supplied the common ring main at 220 volts.Roberts 1978, p. 89 =Armament= Tigers armament as painted by William Lionel Wyllie Tiger mounted eight 45-calibre BL 13.5-inch Mk V guns in four twin hydraulically powered turrets, designated 'A', 'B', 'Q' and 'X' from front to rear. The guns could be depressed to ‚àí5¬∞ and elevated to +20¬∞, although the directors controlling the turrets were limited to 15¬∞ 21' until superelevating prisms were installed before the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 to allow full elevation.Campbell, p. 35 They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of ; at 20¬∞ elevation, this provided a maximum range of . The rate of fire of these guns was approximately 2 rounds per minute.Friedman, pp. 49‚Äì52 The ship carried a total of 1040 rounds during wartime for 130 shells per gun. Her secondary armament consisted of twelve BL 6-inch Mk VII guns in casemates. The guns could depress to ‚àí7¬∞ and had a maximum elevation of 14¬∞. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of approximately ; this gave a maximum range of at +14¬∞ elevation.Friedman, pp. 81‚Äì82 They were provided with 120 rounds per gun. The ship mounted a pair of QF 3 inch 20 cwt\\"Cwt\\" is the abbreviation for hundredweight, 30 cwt referring to the weight of the gun. Mk I anti- aircraft guns on high-angle Mark II mounts. The gun had a maximum elevation of +90¬∞ and fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of . It had a maximum effective ceiling of .Friedman, pp. 108‚Äì110 Originally, Tiger carried 300 rounds per gun, but this was reduced during the war to 150 rounds per gun.Campbell, p. 36 Four submerged torpedo tubes were fitted on the beam, one pair port and starboard forward of 'A' barbette and aft of 'X' barbette. The ship carried 20 Mark II*** torpedoes,The British used asterisks to denote small changes between models. each with a warhead of of TNT. They had two speed settings which governed their range; at , they could reach , or at .Friedman, p. 331 =Fire control= The main guns of Tiger were controlled from either of the two fire-control directors. The primary director was in the fore-top on the foremast and the other was mounted on the aft superstructure in the torpedo control tower. Data from rangefinders in the armoured hood above the conning tower and in 'B' and 'Q' turrets was transmitted to the Mk IV Dreyer Fire Control Table located in the transmitting station below the waterline. The observations were then plotted and converted into range and deflection data for use by the director and guns.Brooks, p. 170 A Mark VII* Dumaresq in the armoured tower was trained on the target to supply bearing data to one transmitting station for use in plotting and calculations, and a second station was fitted for the ship's secondary armament,Roberts 1997, pp. 91‚Äì92 although a pair of fire-control directors for those guns, one for each broadside, were not fitted until 1915.Burt 1986, p. 219 Fire-control technology advanced quickly during the years immediately preceding the First World War and the development of the director firing system was a major advance. This consisted of a fire-control director mounted high in the ship which electrically provided elevation and training angles to the turrets via pointers, which the turret crewmen had only to follow. The director layer fired the guns simultaneously by an electrical trigger which aided in spotting the shell splashes and minimised the effects of the roll on the dispersion of the shells.Roberts 1997, pp. 92‚Äì93 During the war, Tigers rangefinders had increased in number and in size. By the end of the war, 'A' and 'Q' turrets mounted rangefinders while 'X' turret, the armoured hood above the conning tower (also known as the gun control tower), and the torpedo control tower had instruments. A rangefinder was fitted in the fore-top and three instruments were fitted on 'B' turret, the gun control tower and above the compass platform. A high-angle rangefinder was mounted above the roof of the fore-top for use by the anti-aircraft guns.Burt 1986, p. 213 =Armour= Damage suffered by the barbette of 'X' turret during the Battle of Jutland in 1916 Tigers armour protection was similar to that of Queen Mary; her waterline belt of Krupp cemented armour measured thick amidships. It thinned to four inches towards the ship's ends, but did not reach either the bow or the stern. The depth of the main belt below the waterline was reduced from , although a strake of three-inch armour tall was added below the main belt that stretched from the front of 'A' barbette to the rear of 'B' barbette. It was based on that used on the Vickers built Japanese battlecruiser ,Burt 1986, p. 214 the only design influence on Tiger that can be attributed to that ship.Roberts 1978, p. 4 Like the ships and Queen Mary, Tiger was given an upper armour belt with a maximum thickness of six inches over the same length as the thickest part of the waterline armour and thinned to abreast the end turrets. Unlike those ships, Tiger had an additional strake of 6-inch armour above the upper belt protecting her secondary armament. Four-inch transverse bulkheads closed off the ends of the armoured citadel. High-tensile steel was used for the protective decks. They generally ranged from in thickness.Roberts 1997, pp. 112‚Äì113 The gun turrets had 9-inch front and sides while their roofs were thick. The barbettes were protected above the citadel by of armour, thinning to three to four inches inside the citadel. The main conning tower had a three-inch roof and sides thick. The walls of the communication tube were three to four inches thick. The aft conning tower had 6-inch walls and a 3-inch cast steel roof. High-tensile steel torpedo bulkheads thick were fitted abreast the magazines and shell rooms. After the Battle of Jutland revealed the ship's vulnerability to plunging shellfire, around of additional armour was added to the turret roofs, the decks over the magazines, and the bulkheads separating the 6-inch guns. Service history =First World War= Tiger in 1917 Tiger was laid down at the John Brown and Company shipyard in Clydebank on 6 June 1912. She was launched on 15 December 1913 and commissioned into the Royal Navy on 3 October 1914,Roberts 1997, p. 41 at the cost of ¬£2,593,100, including armament.Roberts 1997, p. 83Parkes, p. 551 The ship was still under construction when the First World War broke out in August 1914. On 3 August 1914,Roberts 1997, p. 123 Captain Henry Pelly was appointed to command the incomplete ship. Beatty described Pelly at the time as \\"a very charming person and, what is more important just now, a very efficient officer\\".Beatty, p. 160 Tiger was commissioned for the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron (1st BCS) on 3 October. After the Battle of Coronel and the deployment of three battlecruisers to hunt for the German East Asia Squadron, Tiger was ordered to cut short her firing trials off Berehaven.Goldrick, p. 173 Beatty described Tiger to the First Sea Lord, Admiral of the Fleet Lord Fisher of Kilverstone, as \\"not yet fit to fight. Three out of her four dynamoes are out of action for an indefinite period, and her training is impeded by bad weather, which might continue for many weeks at this time of year, and at present is quite unprepared and inefficient.\\"Fisher, p. 171 Battle of Dogger Bank On 23 January 1915, a force of German battlecruisers under the command of Admiral Franz von Hipper sortied to clear the Dogger Bank of any British fishing boats or small craft that might be there to collect intelligence on German movements. However, the British were reading their coded messages and sailed to intercept them with a larger force of British battlecruisers under the command of Admiral Beatty. Contact was initiated at 07:20The times used in this article are in UTC, which is one hour behind CET, which is often used in German works. on the 24th, when the British light cruiser spotted the German light cruiser . By 07:35, the Germans had spotted Beatty's force and Hipper ordered a turn to the south at , believing this would suffice if the ships he saw to his north-west were British battleships and that he could always increase speed to 's maximum speed of if they were British battlecruisers.Massie, pp. 376‚Äì384 Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to make all practicable speed to catch the Germans before they could escape. The leading ships, , and Tiger, were doing in pursuit and Lion opened fire at 08:52 at a range of . The other ships followed a few minutes later but, hampered by the extreme range and decreasing visibility, they did not score their first hit on Bl√ºcher until 09:09. The German battlecruisers opened fire themselves a few minutes later at 09:11, at a range of , and concentrated their fire on Lion. At 09:35, Beatty signalled \\"Engage the corresponding ships in the enemy's line\\", but Captain Pelly, believing that was already engaging Bl√ºcher, fired at , as did Lion, which left free to continue attacking Lion without risk.Tarrant, pp. 35‚Äì36 Moltke during a 1912 port visit to the U.S. In the meantime, Bl√ºcher had been heavily damaged by fire from all the other battlecruisers; her speed had dropped to and her steering gear had been jammed. Beatty ordered Indomitable to attack her at 10:48. Six minutes later, Beatty spotted what he thought was a submarine periscope on the starboard bow and ordered an immediate 90¬∞ turn to port to avoid the submarine, although he failed to hoist the \\"Submarine Warning\\" flag because most of Lions signal halyards had been shot away. Shortly afterward, Lion lost her remaining dynamo to the rising water which knocked out all remaining light and power. He ordered \\"Course north-east\\" at 11:02 to bring his ships back to their pursuit of Hipper. He also hoisted \\"Attack the rear of the enemy\\" on the other halyard, although there was no connection between the two signals. Rear- Admiral Sir Gordon Moore, temporarily commanding in , thought that the signals meant for him to attack Bl√ºcher, which was about to the north-east, which he did, turning away from Hipper's main body. Beatty tried to correct the mistake, but he was so far behind the leading battlecruisers that his signals could not be read amidst the smoke and haze.Massie, pp. 398‚Äì402 He transferred his flag to the destroyer at 11:50 and set off in pursuit of his battlecruisers. He caught up to them shortly before Bl√ºcher sank and boarded Princess Royal at 12:20. He ordered the pursuit of the German battlecruisers to be resumed, but rescinded the order when it became clear that too much time had been wasted sinking Bl√ºcher and Hipper's ships would be able to reach German waters before the British could catch them. Lion was headed home at when the rest of the battlecruisers caught up with her around 12:45.Tarrant, p. 38 During the action, Tiger was hit by six German shells, the most significant of which was a shell that burst on the roof of 'Q' turret. Although most of the shell was deflected overboard, fragments penetrated the roof, damaged the left gun's breech mechanism and jammed the training gear, knocking the turret out of action. Ten men were killed during the battle and 11 wounded. Tigers repairs were completed on 8 February. Like the rest of the battlecruisers, Tigers own gunnery was rapid, but inaccurate, and she achieved only two hits out of 355 shells fired, scoring one hit each on Seydlitz and .Campbell 1978, p. 40 Her performance was noted and commented upon by the senior leadership of the Royal Navy: Lord Fisher criticised Pelly's performance, calling him a \\"poltroon\\"Quoted in Goldrick, p. 298 and adding \\"The Tigers gunnery seems to have been villainously bad on January 24, yet she seems to have had a lot of practice.\\".Fisher, p. 155 In a memorandum of 11 February 1915, Beatty explained to Pelly where the latter had misconstrued the standing orders, going through Tigers part in the battle blow by blow and comparing it to that of other ships. His final paragraph was conciliatory however: \\"In making these remarks I have no wish to express censure in any form. I realise that a newly-commissioned ship in her first action has many difficulties to contend with, and I am quite ready to make the fullest allowance for them. My chief aim is to ensure that our next action shall be a complete success.\\"Beatty, pp. 245‚Äì248 The ship was given a refit in December 1915. Battle of Jutland Diagram of the Battle of Jutland showing the major movements On 31 May 1916, Tiger and the 1st BCS had put to sea with the rest of the Battlecruiser Fleet, under Beatty's overall command, to intercept a sortie by the High Seas Fleet into the North Sea. The British had decoded the German radio messages, and left their bases before the Germans put to sea. Hipper's battlecruisers spotted the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 15:20, but Beatty's ships did not see the Germans to their east until 15:30. Two minutes later, Beatty ordered a course change to east-southeast, positioning the British ships to cut off the German's line of retreat, and signalled action stations. Hipper ordered his ships to turn to starboard, away from the British, to assume a south-easterly course, and reduced speed to to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up. With this turn, Hipper was falling back on the High Seas Fleet, behind him. Beatty altered course to the east, as he was still too far north to cut Hipper off.Tarrant, pp. 69, 71, 75 The roof of 'Q' turret after a German shell hit during the Battle of Jutland This was later characterised as the \\"Run to the South\\" as Beatty changed course to steer east-southeast at 15:45, now paralleling Hipper's course less than away. The Germans opened fire first at 15:48, followed by the British. The British ships were still in the process of making their turn as only the two leading ships, Lion and Princess Royal, had steadied on their course when the Germans opened fire. The 1st BCS was echeloned to the right with Tiger in the rear and the furthest to the west, closest to the Germans. Tiger missed Beatty's fire distribution order, as had Queen Mary, and Tiger engaged Moltke, instead of Seydlitz as Beatty intended.Brooks, pp. 187‚Äì191 The German fire was accurate from the start, with Tiger hit six times by Moltke within the first seven minutes; although two of these hits temporarily disabled both 'Q' and 'X' turrets, she was not seriously damaged.Campbell, p. 42 By 15:54, the range was down to ; Beatty ordered a course change two points to starboard to open up the range at 15:57.Tarrant, p. 83 Around 16:00, was hit around the rear turret by two or three shells from Von der Tann. She fell out of formation to starboard and started sinking toward the stern and listing to port.Tarrant, pp. 80‚Äì85 Her magazines exploded at 16:03 after more hits destroying the ship with the loss of all hands but three.Campbell 1998, p. 61 The range gradually increased until the distance between the British and German ships was too great for accurate fire, so Beatty altered course four points to port between 16:12 and 16:15 to close the range. By 16:25, the range was down to and Beatty turned two points to starboard to open the range again. Around this time, Queen Mary was hit multiple times in quick succession and her forward magazines exploded.Tarrant, pp. 89‚Äì91 Tiger, following in Queen Marys wake at a distance of only , had to put her helm hard-a-starboard to avoid colliding with the wreckage.Massie, p. 595 At 16:30, the light cruiser , scouting in front of Beatty's ships, spotted the lead elements of the High Seas Fleet coming north at top speed. Three minutes later, she sighted the topmasts of Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer's battleships, but did not report this for another five minutes. Beatty continued south for another two minutes to confirm the sighting before ordering his force to turn north.Massie, pp. 598‚Äì600 By this time, Tiger had been hit a total of 17 times, all but one fired by Moltke, but she remained fit to fight.Tarrant, p. 97 The German battlecruisers made their own turn north in pursuit,Massie, p. 601 but Beatty's ships maintained full speed, and gradually moved out of range. The British battlecruisers turned north, then north-east, to try to rendezvous with the main body of the Grand Fleet, and at 17:40 opened fire again on their German counterparts. The setting sun blinded the German gunners and they could not make out the British ships and turned away to the north-east at 17:47.Tarrant, p. 109 Beatty gradually turned toward the east so his ships could cover the Grand Fleet as it deployed into battle formation, but he mistimed his manoeuvre and forced the leading British division further from the Germans. By 18:35, Beatty was following the 3rd BCS as they were leading the Grand Fleet east-southeast, and continuing to engage Hipper's battlecruisers to their south-west. A few minutes earlier, Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180¬∞ starboard turn, and Beatty lost sight of them in the haze.Tarrant, pp. 130‚Äì138 At 18:44, Beatty turned his ships south-east, then south-southeast four minutes later, to find Hipper's force. He then ordered the two surviving ships of the 3rd BCS to take position astern of New Zealand, while slowing to and altering course to the south to stay close to the Grand Fleet. At this moment, Lions gyrocompass failed, and she‚Äîfollowed by the rest of the battlecruisers‚Äîmade a complete circle before her steering was brought back under control.Tarrant, p. 145 At 18:55, Scheer ordered another 180¬∞ turn, which put the German ships on a converging course again with the Grand Fleet. However, the British had altered course to the south, allowing the Grand Fleet to cross Scheer's \\"T\\" and inflict damage on the leading German ships. Scheer ordered yet another 180¬∞ turn at 19:13, and successfully extricated the High Seas Fleet from the trap his manoeuvring caused.Tarrant, pp. 149, 157 An early, and not necessarily reliable, diagram showing shell hits sustained at Jutland The British lost sight of the Germans until spotted smoke to the west-northwest at 20:05, then identified and engaged several German torpedo boats. On hearing the sound of gunfire, Beatty ordered his ships west, and spotted the German battlecruisers only away. Inflexible opened fire at 20:20, followed almost immediately by the rest of the battlecruisers.Tarrant, p. 175 Shortly after 8:30, the pre- dreadnought battleships of Rear Admiral Franz Mauve's II Battle Squadron were spotted. The British battlecruisers and German pre-dreadnoughts exchanged fire; the Germans fired only a few times before turning away to the west because of poor visibility and the more accurate British gunnery, and disappeared into the mist around 20:40.Tarrant, pp. 177‚Äì78 Beatty's battlecruisers sailed south-southeast, ahead of both the Grand Fleet and the High Seas Fleet, until the order to reverse course for home was given at 02:55.Tarrant, pp. 178, 224 Tiger and the rest of the battlecruisers reached Rosyth Dockyard in Scotland on the morning of 2 June. Docked the next day for repairs which took until 1 July, she was the first of the \\"Splendid Cats\\" to be repaired. Tiger was hit a total of 18 times during the battle, mostly by shells fired by Moltke, suffering 24 men killed and 46 wounded. The battlecruiser fired 303 shells from her main guns during the battle and is credited with one hit on Moltke and two on . The ship also fired 136 rounds from her 6-inch guns at the light cruiser and German destroyers. Post- Jutland service Tiger as painted by William Lionel Wyllie after the Battle of Jutland After her repairs were completed, Tiger served as the temporary flagship of the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron while Lion was under repair.Burt 1986, p. 220 In the meantime, on the evening of 18 August the Grand Fleet put to sea in response to a message deciphered by Room 40 which indicated that the High Seas Fleet, less the II Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The German objective was to bombard Sunderland on the 19th, with extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines. The Grand Fleet sailed with 29 dreadnought battleships and six battlecruisers, including Tiger. Throughout the 19th, Jellicoe and Scheer received conflicting intelligence, with the result that having reached its rendezvous in the North Sea, the Grand Fleet steered north in the erroneous belief it had entered a minefield before turning south again. Scheer steered south-eastward pursuing a lone British battle squadron reported by an airship, which was in fact the Harwich Force under Commodore Tyrwhitt. Having realised their mistake, the Germans then steered for home. The only contact came in the evening when Tyrwhitt sighted the High Seas Fleet, but he was unable to achieve an advantageous attack position before dark, and broke off contact. Both the British and the German fleets returned home; the British had lost two cruisers to submarine attacks, and a German dreadnought had been damaged by a torpedo.Marder, pp. 287‚Äì296Naval Staff Monograph No. 33 1927, pp. 258, 267 The ship received a lengthy refit from 10 November 1916 to 29 January 1917 at Rosyth where her deck and turret roof armour were reinforced and additional rangefinders were added over her conning tower and the rear of 'X' turret. For the remainder of the war, Tiger uneventfully patrolled the North Sea, as both fleets were essentially forbidden to risk any more losses. She provided support for British light forces involved in the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight on 17 November 1917, but never came within range of any German forces.Newbolt, p. 169 The same year saw her undergo a minor refit during which a flying-off platform for a Sopwith Camel was mounted on 'Q' turret and a searchlight platform was added to her third funnel. She underwent a more extensive refit in 1918 which saw her topmast shifted to the top of the derrick-stump and a more substantial observation platform added to the foremast. Some of her short rangefinders were replaced by longer ones as well. =Post-war= Sopwith Camel ready for launch from 'Q' turret Tiger remained in service with the Royal Navy after the Armistice with Germany and she had a flying-off platform added on 'B' turret's roof in 1919. The ship collided with the battleship in late 1920 while assigned to the Atlantic Fleet. Tiger survived the culling of older capital ships following the Washington Naval Treaty, although she was placed in reserve on 22 August 1921. The ship was refitted in March 1922 with a rangefinder fitted on 'X' turret, her original pair of 3-inch AA guns replaced by four guns, and the flying-off platform on 'Q' turret was removed.Burt 1986, pp. 219‚Äì220 On 14 February 1924, Tiger was recommissioned and became a seagoing training ship, a role she served in throughout the 1920s. Her last major period of activity came in 1929, when went into dockyard hands for refit. While Hood was out of commission, Tiger returned to active service to keep the Royal Navy's three-ship Battlecruiser Squadron (normally made up of Hood plus the smaller and ) up to strength. Although by the 1930s, Tiger was still in reasonable condition, the decision was taken to discard her following the London Naval Conference 1930 as part of an overall reduction in world battleship fleets. Under the command of Captain Kenneth Dewar in 1928 to 1929, her final commander was Arthur Bedford, and she remained in service with the fleet until Hood came out of refit in early 1931, at which time she was taken out of commission in accordance with the terms of the London Naval Treaty.Burt 1993, pp. 23, 51 Tiger took the cheers of the Atlantic Fleet on 30 March 1931 at Devonport.Parkes, p. 557 She paid off on 15 May 1931 at Rosyth, before being sold to Thos W Ward of Inverkeithing for breaking up in February 1932.

California Place Names: A Geographical Dictionary. Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 1949. p55 is an unincorporated community located near the border of Contra Costa and Alameda counties, in the U.S. state of California. It is situated between Oakland and Moraga in the San Francisco Bay Area. The community is named for its location in the upper canyon of San Leandro Creek along the eastern slope of the Berkeley Hills. Canyon lies at an elevation of 1138 feet (347 m). The community is mainly traversed by Pinehurst Road and Canyon Road. The homes of the community are nestled amongst the steep, narrow private roads and footpaths that extend from the redwood groves and ferns along the creek, through the mixed live oak, bay, and madrone forests on the steep hillsides, up to the chaparral and knobcone pines that grow along the ridge. History Canyon has a colorful history. Logging camps and notorious saloons helped establish a local reputation for rowdiness in the nineteenth century. A vast forest known as the Moraga Redwoods once covered the valley that is now Canyon. An extant fire trail west of the spot where Pinehurst Road makes a sharp hairpin turn near Huckleberry Botanic Regional Preserve was previously known as Winding Way on some maps, and was originally an old 19th century logging road built by Hiram Thorn. In the 1850s, Thorn operated a mill on the site. Thorn built the road to bring redwood logs out of the forest and to his mill, and then over the mountain into Oakland via the Temescal Creek route on the northwest edge of Montclair Village. The Oakland part of the route is now known as Thornhill Road. In the first half of the 20th century, the local water company, East Bay Municipal Utilities District, purchased much land south of town. They constructed the Upper San Leandro Reservoir, which slowly as it filled up, flooded the former towns of Valle Vista and Redwood. The reservoir also flooded several neighbourhoods of Canyon itself. In fact, the only reason Canyon is not the size of neighbouring Moraga is because a lack of a viable water resource. The few people that do live there are mostly commuters and retired people who like the town's seclusion, with close proximity to San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose. Earlier in the 20th century, the Sacramento Northern Railway ran through the canyon for which the community is named. The rails ran on a bench (still present) above Pinehurst Road, upon exiting a long tunnel from Oakland at the site of Thorn's road. The eastern portal (called Eastport by the railroad) just north of Canyon was buried by a landslide in 1980 and is no longer visible, but was located on the inside of the hairpin turn on Pinehurst Road. In the late 1960s, Canyon became a center of political and social protest and creative alternative lifestyles. Canyon Cinema of San Francisco was founded by neighbors here in the 1960s. In the summer of 1967 Country Joe and the Fish with the Youngbloods played a benefit for the Canyon School. Today's residents still work together to maintain their own roads and water systems, and Canyon Community Association volunteers provide mediation services, emergency planning, and interface with county and state agencies. Much of the land beyond the community is owned by the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD). Infrastructure The only public services in the community are the local post office (ZIP Code 94516) where all mail is picked up and the Canyon School, a 68-student K-8 public school, located on Pinehurst Road on the banks of the Upper San Leandro Creek. A notion of the community's unconventionality may be gleaned from the fact that the school lunch menu features organic milk and produce, Niman Ranch beef, and hormone and antibiotic free chicken. The community is in area code 925. As John van der Zee wrote in his book about the town, Canyon (1972): Between 2011 and 2013, a Carmelite monastery was located on a ranch in the western area of the town. The nuns moved in 2014 to a building in the nearby town of Kensington, California.https://www.mercurynews.com/2014/02/26/kensington-landmark-will-be- a-monastery-once-more/ Climate Canyon enjoys a cool summer Mediterranean climate (Koppen classification csb) similar to that of the nearby city of Oakland, California, though slightly warmer. Fog maintains the cool summer weather.

It was first produced in 1823 by James Pimm and has been owned by Diageo since 1997. Its most popular product is Pimm's No. 1 Cup. History Pimm's and lemonade with mint sprigs and fruit Pimm, a farmer's son from Kent, became the owner of an oyster bar in the City of London, near the Bank of England. He offered the tonic (a gin-based drink containing a secret mixture of herbs and liqueurs) as an aid to digestion, serving it in a small tankard known as a \\"No. 1 Cup\\", hence its subsequent name. In 1851, Pimm's No. 2 Cup and Pimm's No. 3 Cup were introduced. Pimm's began large-scale production in 1851 to keep up with sales to other bars. The distillery began selling it commercially in 1859. In 1865, Pimm sold the business and the right to use his name to Frederick Sawyer. In 1880, the business was acquired by future Lord Mayor of London Horatio Davies, and a chain of Pimm's Oyster Houses was franchised in 1887. Over the years, Pimm's extended their range, using other spirits as bases for new \\"cups\\". After World War II, Pimm's No. 4 Cup was invented, followed by Pimm's No. 5 Cup and Pimm's No. 6 Cup in the 1960s. The brand fell on hard times in the 1970s and 1980s. The Oyster House chain was sold and Pimm's Cup products Nos. 2 to 5 were phased out due to reduced demand in 1970 after new owners The Distillers Company had taken control. The Distillers Company was subsequently purchased by Guinness PLC in 1986 Guinness directors showed 'contempt for truth' BBC, 28 November 1997 and Pimm's became part of Diageo when Guinness and Grand Metropolitan merged in 1997. In 2005, Pimm's introduced Pimm's Winter Cup, which consists of Pimm's No. 3 Cup (the brandy-based variant) infused with spices and orange peel. Serving A Pimm's stand set up in a music festival using a converted bus as a bar area It has a dark-brown colour with a reddish tint, and tastes subtly of spice and citrus fruit. As a summer long drink, it is normally served as Pimm's cocktail, a drink with \\"English-style\\" (clear and carbonated) lemonade, as well as various chopped garnishes, particularly apples, cucumber, oranges, lemons, strawberry, and mint or borage, though nowadays most substitute mint. Ginger ale is a common substitute for lemonade. Pimm's can also be mixed with Champagne (or a sparkling white wine), called a \\"Pimm's Royal Cup\\". Pimm's Winter Cup is generally mixed with warm apple juice. A Glasgow Garden Party substitutes Irn Bru for lemonade and excludes any fruit garnish. A Pimm's mojito substitutes muddled limes and soda water for lemon-lime soda. Pimm's is most popular in England, particularly southern England. It is one of the two staple drinks at the Wimbledon tennis tournament, the Chelsea Flower Show, the Henley Royal Regatta and the Glyndebourne Festival Opera the other being champagne. The first Pimm's Bar opened at the Wimbledon tournament in 1971 and every year, over 80,000 pints of Pimm's cocktail are sold to spectators. Along with champagne, it has been declared one of two official drinks of Wimbledon, and it has also gained popularity among British universities. A Pimm's is also a standard cocktail at British and American polo matches. It is also extremely popular at the summer garden parties of British universities. The brand experienced a revival following a 2003 advertising campaign featuring a humorous classic upper-class Hooray Henry called Harry Fitzgibbon-Sims (portrayed by Alexander Armstrong) with the catchphrase \\"It's Pimm's o'clock!\\", somewhat mocking their own traditional advertising and appeal. Diageo's 2010 campaign features a more diverse range of characters representing different elements of the Pimm's cocktail (Pimm's No.1 being an Englishman in red and white blazer, lemonade being three young women in yellow, ice represented by a mature man), coming together to the theme tune of 1970s British television show The New Avengers. Products Some less- frequently-seen Pimm's bottles Seven Pimm's products have been produced, all fruit cups, differing only in their base alcohol: Only Nos. 1, 6, and a 'Winter Cup' based on No. 3 remain. * Pimm's No. 1 Cup is the most popular version. Based on gin, its base as bottled is 25 percent alcohol by volume. ** can also be purchased as a pre-mixed fortified lemonade (Pimm's & Lemonade) in 250 ml cans or 1-litre bottles, at 5.4 percent. * Pimm's No. 2 Cup was based on Scotch whisky. Currently phased out. * Pimm's No. 3 Cup is based on brandy. Phased out, but a version infused with spices and orange peel marketed as Pimm's Winter Cup is now seasonally available. * Pimm's No. 4 Cup was based on rum. Currently phased out. * Pimm's No. 5 Cup was based on rye whisky. Currently phased out. * Pimm's No. 6 Cup is based on vodka. It is still produced, but in small quantities.

Conway has won 2 MLS Cup Championships. After the 2005 season, Conway was traded to the MetroStars in exchange for a fourth-round draft pick. In 2006, Conway finished best among all goalkeepers in MLS with a 1.00 GAA (goals against average) and compiled a record of 7 wins, 2 losses and 3 ties with 5 shutouts. In 2007, Conway compiled a record of 6 wins, 5 losses and 2 ties with 4 shutouts and a 1.10 GAA. He entered the 2008 season as the starting goalkeeper for the since renamed New York Red Bulls. On June 29, 2009, Conway was released by New York to free a spot for Senegalese goal keeper Bouna Coundoul. In September 2009, Conway's MLS rights, which under MLS roster rules were still held by Red Bulls even after his release, were traded to Chivas USA for a fourth-round pick in the 2011 MLS SuperDraft.http://www.goal.com/en-us/news/1110/major-league- soccer/2009/09/11/1495831/chivas-usa-net-gk-jon-conway-among-other-moves After the waiving of back-up keeper Brian Edwards, Toronto FC acquired the 32-year- old goalkeeper to replace Edwards.Reds Sign Conway, Waive Edwards Conway made his debut for Toronto in the Canadian Championship against the Vancouver Whitecaps May 19, 2010. He continued to make non-league appearances for Toronto throughout the 2010 season within the Canadian Championship and the CONCACAF Champions League. Conway had a stand out performance versus Real Salt Lake in the Champions League in a 1-1 home draw on September 28, 2010 setting up teammate Jacob Peterson with a long throw to start the break. He made his first league appearance for Toronto on October 16, 2010 in a 2-2 home draw versus Columbus Crew in which he received a red card in the 72nd minute. Toronto traded Conway to Chicago Fire on January 13, 2011 in exchange for the #49 pick in the 2011 MLS SuperDraft. At season's end, Chicago declined his 2012 contract option and he entered the 2011 MLS Re-Entry Draft.

His most famous work is the play The Ruling Class, which was made into a 1972 film for which Peter O'Toole received an Oscar nomination. Biography =Early career= Barnes was educated at Marling School in Stroud, Gloucestershire and performed his national service with the Royal Air Force. He then worked briefly for London County Council. Bored with his job, Barnes took a correspondence course in theology and began to visit the British Museum Reading Room, which he used as an office on a daily basis. During this period he worked as a film critic, story editor, and a screenwriter. He achieved critical and box-office success with his baroque comedy The Ruling Class (1968), which debuted at the Nottingham Playhouse. The play was notorious for its anti-naturalistic approach, unusual in theatre at the time. Critic Harold Hobson deemed it to be one of the best first plays of its generation. Following a successful three-month run in the West End, Barnes adapted the play for the 1972 film of the same name, which featured a highly acclaimed performance by Peter O'Toole. =Later plays= Following his initial success, Barnes wrote a series of plays offering apocalyptic visions of various periods in history: * Leonardo's Last Supper (1969) portrayed Leonardo da Vinci as prematurely declared dead, with his subsequent \\"resurrection\\" in a filthy charnel-house. * The Bewitched (1974), which he produced with the Royal Shakespeare Company, showed the Spanish state attempting to produce an heir for Carlos II, whom Barnes portrayed as being an impotent imbecile. * Laughter! (1978) was his most controversial work, a double-bill that jumped from the reign of Ivan the Terrible to a satire based on the tedious bureaucracy required to sustain Auschwitz concentration camp. * Red Noses (1985) depicts a sprightly priest, originally played by Antony Sher, who travelled around the plague-affected villages of 14th century France with a band of fools, known as God's Zanies, offering holy assistance. It was for this play that Barnes won his Olivier award. =Later life= In his later years Barnes turned his attention more in the direction of films, radio, and television. His screenplay for Elizabeth von Arnim's The Enchanted April earned him a nomination for the best adapted screenplay Oscar in 1992. He also wrote several hugely successful mini-series for U.S. television, including Arabian Nights, Merlin and Noah's Ark. For BBC Radio 3 he wrote a series of monologues entitled Barnes's People, for which he attracted a large number of well known actors: Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud, Alec Guinness, Peggy Ashcroft, Judi Dench, and Ian McKellen. His television miniseries for ABC and NBC were the most popular of the day with record audiences. Barnes continued writing historical comedies throughout the 1990s. These include Sunsets and Glories (1990), Dreaming (1999) which transferred to London's West End, and Jubilee (2001). He was the Royal Shakespeare Company's most produced living playwright at the time. The last play that Barnes completed was Babies, which is based on his experiences as an elderly father. His second wife gave birth to a daughter when he was 69, followed by triplets a year later. John Irvin directed his Moon and the Stars with Alfred Molina about the film business in 1930s' Rome. A revival of his Noonday Demons was produced by renowned theatre designer John Napier. Barnes television miniseries are shown yearly as holiday favourites.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 14, 2004. In the episode, Marge gets her kitchen remodeled and the dishes she makes inside it get rave reviews. The suggestion of Ned Flanders leads her to enter a cooking contest. However, Marge realizes the competition is harder than it seems. Meanwhile, Bart finds Homer's vintage Playdude magazines and decides to adopt the lifestyle he sees within the articles. Matt Selman wrote the episode, and Mark Kirkland served as director. Thomas Pynchon and James Caan guest starred as themselves. The episode features cultural references to songs such as \\"Separate Ways\\", \\"Boplicity\\", and \\"Take Five\\", as well as references to the film The Godfather and various fictional food mascots. The episode received positive reviews from critics.  Plot  Marge and Homer discover the house next to them is up for sale, and marvel at the extensive kitchen inside the house. After realizing the poor quality of her own kitchen, she asks Homer to hire a contractor. Not wanting to pay the price of hiring one, he decides to remodel it himself. While remodeling the kitchen, Homer unearths his old collection of Playdude magazines. After Marge sees them, he innocently tells her he kept them only for the articles, and she decides to make sure by cutting out all the nudes from the magazines. After this, Homer decides that they are now of no use, and throws them away, only for them to be found by Bart and Milhouse. After reading the 1970s magazines, they are inspired to renovate their treehouse. After Homer's attempts of remodeling the kitchen fail, Marge finally decides to hire a contractor herself. Despite the contractor assuring that the renovation will be done in three weeks, it takes two years of renovation. Marge's kitchen is finally remodelled, for the price of $100,000. She then cooks her first dish in the kitchen, which gets rave reviews from many Springfieldians, as well as author Thomas Pynchon. At the Kwik-E-Mart, Marge encounters an advertisement for the Ovenfresh bake-off, in which the grand prize is being Ovenfresh's spokeswoman, \\"Auntie Ovenfresh\\". Under Ned Flanders's advice, she decides to enter the bake-off with her \\"dessert dogs\\" and she wins, beating Ralph's \\"Grilled crayon sandwich.\\" At the bake-off, most of the competitors cheat by ruining Marge's dessert dogs on purpose while insulting her, so while alone in the judging room, Marge retaliates by tainting all of the competitors' entries with Maggie's ear medicine. This was witnessed by Lisa, who then loses her faith in her as a result. Meanwhile, Chief Wiggum and other concerned parents talk to Homer about Bart spreading Playdude to the other children. Realizing that Bart has got the magazines he threw away, Homer decides to have a talk with him about sex. After the talk, a horrified Bart quickly spreads the talk to Milhouse and the other children, horrifying them as well. Meanwhile, Lisa confronts Marge for cheating, but she defends her actions by stating that the competitors pushed her into doing so with their antics. At the bake-off finals against Brandine Spuckler, Marge considers cheating again, but then discovers a note from Lisa and admits to her foul play, restoring Lisa's faith in her. Not long afterwards, the new Auntie Ovenfresh flour bag with Brandine on it comes out and her husband, Cletus mentions that she has left him for James Caan. In response, Cletus's friends ambush Caan at a toll booth and gun him down in a scene reminiscent of the death of Sonny Corleone, Caan's character in the film The Godfather. He survives and complains about the scene.  Production  alt=A black and white photo of a man in a striped shirt and jacket who has curly hair. The episode was written Matt Selman, his eleventh writing credit for The Simpsons. The episode was the first season sixteen episode that Mark Kirkland directed. Reclusive novelist Thomas Pynchon guest stars as himself in the episode, wearing a paper bag over his head. His role is reprised from the season 15 episode \\"Diatribe of a Mad Housewife\\". According to executive producer Al Jean, Pynchon helped write the jokes for his appearances. James Caan also guest stars in the episode, first seen in Bart's treehouse. He is then shown dating Brandine Spuckler, and he is later shot by hillbillies at a toll booth. Thomas Pynchon offers insight on Marge‚Äôs cooking. Pynchon contributes his own jokes‚Äîincluding a pun he made on his best-known work, The Frying Of Latke 49. Pynchon refused to call Homer a \\"fat- ass\\" as he did not want to speak ill of him. In the original version of this episode, after Homer tells Marge that she is the \\"best chef in the house\\", Marge grumbles, \\"Eh, BFD\\", which stands for \\"big, fucking deal\\". On Sunday night FOX repeats, the \\"F\\" in \\"BFD\\" is muted out. The original line can be heard in syndicated and UK reruns. The syndicated version also credits Russi Taylor, who was not credited in the original version of the episode. The Godfather parody was cut short in the UK version, and several sexual references from Bart's \\"playdude\\" plot were removed. The show in the UK is broadcast at six and needed to be appropriate for children.  Cultural references  The episode's title is a play on the saying \\"All's fair in love and war\\", a proverb found in John Lyly's 16th-century book EuphuesTitelman, Gregory Y. \\"Random House Dictionary of Popular Proverbs and Sayings\\", Random House, N.Y., 1996. that is commonly used to justify cheating. The episode features three different songs. The song \\"Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)\\" by Journey is played in the background during Homer's fantasy of him living next to himself. \\"Boplicity\\" by Miles Davis is listened to by Bart and Milhouse, and \\"Take Five\\" by The Dave Brubeck Quartet is played in the background at Bart's treehouse. The episode's final scene, showing James Caan being ambushed by hillbillies at a toll booth, is a parody of a scene in the film The Godfather when Sonny Corleone, portrayed by Caan, is shot and killed at a toll booth. The scene was also parodied in the episode \\"Mr. Plow\\", in which Bart gets pelted by snowballs by Nelson and his gang of bullies. Marge suggesting that the pope has been letting things slide lately, is a reference to the sex abuse scandal of the early 2000s.  Reception  In its original American broadcast, \\"All's Fair in Oven War\\" garnered roughly 11.64 million viewers. The episode received a 6.4 Neilsen rating. The episode has garnered positive reviews from critics. Eric Messinger of Springfield Weekly gave the episode a positive review. He gave the episode a B-, stating the Marge segment \\"needed a bit more fine-tuning\\". However, he praised the Bart segment, stating that it saved the episode, and that Bart not seeing nudity in the Playdude magazines worked well in every joke, and the segment was almost reminiscent to the season three episode \\"Bart the Murderer\\". He also praised the James Caan guest appearance, stating it \\"worked quite well, especially with the Godfather ending pay-off.\\" In 2012, New York magazine named \\"All Fair's in Oven War\\" as one of the ten best later Simpsons episodes. Ellwood Hughes of Entertainment Focus considered the episode a highlight of the season. Chris Morgan of Cinema Sentries praised the episode and commented \\"It is, arguably, the best episode to air after the turn of the millennium, and, in fact, is one of the top episodes of the show, period.\\" A review of the season 16 DVD on alternativeaddiction.com listed it as one of \\"some incredibly fun episode ideas\\". On Rolling Stones top 150 Simpsons episodes they placed \\"All's Fair in Oven War\\" at #89.

Biography He was born in London, the son of John Parker, a merchant there. He was educated at Manor House School, Chiswick, and was apprenticed in 1821 to his uncle, the Oxford bookseller Joseph Parker (1774?‚Äì1850). He succeeded to his uncle's business in 1832, and ran the firm with great success, the most important of his publications being perhaps the series of the Oxford pocket classics. In 1836 he published his Glossary of terms used in Grecian, Roman, Italian, and Gothic architecture, which, published during the Gothic Revival in England, had considerable influence in extending the movement, and supplied valuable inspiration to young architects. In 1848 he edited the fifth edition of Thomas Rickman's Gothic architecture, and in 1849 he published a handbook based on his earlier volume entitled Introduction to the study of Gothic architecture. The completion of Hudson Turner's Domestic architecture of the Middle Ages next engaged his attention, three volumes being published (1853‚Äì60). He published Medieval architecture of Chester in 1858 and Architectural antiquities of the city of Wells in 1866. Parker was one of the chief advocates of the restoration of ecclesiastical buildings. In 1863 he and the Oxford Diocesan Architect G.E. Street revised plans for the restoration of St. Andrew's parish church, Chinnor. Parker also designed the triplet of traceried lancet windows in the chancel of St. Nicholas the Confessor, Forest Hill. His son James Parker (1832 or 1833‚Äì1912) also practiced as an architect. Later he devoted much attention to explorations of the history of Rome by means of excavations, and succeeded in satisfying himself of the historical truth of much usually regarded as legendary. Two volumes of his Archaeology of Rome were published at Oxford in 1874 and 1876. In recognition of his work Parker was decorated by King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy and received a medal from Pope Pius IX. In 1869 he endowed the keepership of the Ashmolean Museum with a sum yielding ¬£250 a year, and under the new arrangement he was appointed the first keeper. In 1871 he was nominated CB. In Italy one of Parker's principal projects was to compose an archive collection of photographs of the city's greatest monuments from the Renaissance era onwards. Employing local photographers the collection recorded not only Rome's greatest building and works, but also detailed scenes of the late 19th century archaeological excavations. He used many of these to illustrate his books. In 1893 the entire archive perished in a fire at the Palazzo Della Porta Negroni Caffarelli depriving modern archeologists of an invaluable source of material.American Academy in Rome Retrieved 29 April 2010.

History Formerly Peramangk Aboriginal territory, European settlers first arrived in the late 1830s with timber from the area used in the construction of the city of Adelaide. From the 1850s the area was mined for copper and silver with the Almanda Mining Association formed in 1868. By the time production ceased in 1887 (due to economic reasons), 310 kilograms of silver had been mined. The land was privately owned until the early 1970s when land was purchased by the South Australian Government, with the conservation park being declared in 1985. Facilities The conservation park has an extensive network of walking trails which enables visitors to select walks appropriate to their level of fitness, specific interests and personal time frame.

Service Queen fought at the First Battle of Ushant under Keppel in 1778, and the Second Battle of Ushant under Kempenfelt in 1781. In 1794 she fought in the Glorious First of June under Howe, where she served as Rear-Admiral Alan Gardner's flagship. During the battle Queen sustained significant damage, and her commanding officer, Captain John Hutt, was amongst those killed. For some of the period between 1798 and 1802, she was under the command of Captain Theophilus Jones. After the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, Queen continued in the blockade of Cadiz. On 25 November, detained the Ragusan ship Nemesis, which was sailing from Isle de France to Leghorn, Italy, with a cargo of spice, indigo dye, and other goods. Queen shared the prize money with ten other British warships. On 25 October 1806, the Spanish privateer General√≠simo captured HM gunboat Hannah, which was serving as a tender to Queen. After Trafalgar, the demand for the large three-decker first and second rates diminished. Consequently, in 1811 the Admiralty had Queen razeed to become a two-decker third rate of 74 guns. Fate Queen was eventually broken up in 1821, at the age of 52.

He is particularly remembered for his Attempt to Discriminate the Styles of English Architecture (1817), which established the basic chronological classification and terminology that are still in widespread use for the different styles of English medieval ecclesiastical architecture. Early life Rickman was born on 8 June 1776 at Maidenhead, Berkshire, into a large Quaker family. He avoided the medical career envisaged for him by his father, a grocer and druggist, and instead went into business for himself. He married his first cousin Lucy Rickman in 1804, a marriage that estranged him from the Quakers.According to Alex Kerr, Rickman was disowned, in 1804, for marrying his first cousin \\"before a priest\\", but continued to attend Meetings for Worship. He was widowed and, in 1813, applied to be re-admitted, prior to his second marriage, which was accepted. However, he later became an Irvingite. See Antiquarian activities The failure of his business dealings in London and the death of his first wife left Rickman despondent: the long walks into the countryside that he took for his state of mind were the beginning of his first, antiquarian interest in church architecture. All his spare time was spent in sketching and making careful measured drawings, and classifying medieval architecture, at first through its window tracery, into the sequence that he labelled \\"Norman\\" \\"Early English\\", \\"Decorated English\\" and \\"Perpendicular English\\", names that have remained in use, which he was already employing in his diariesRickman's diaries are conserved at the R.I.B.A. Library. in 1811; he gained a knowledge of architecture which was very remarkable at a time when little taste existed for the beauties of the Gothic styles. The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 1911 reported that \\"in 1811 alone he is said to have studied three thousand ecclesiastical buildings\\". In September that year he gave the first of a series of lectures on medieval architecture at the small Philosophical Society of Liverpool, which he had joined. His first publication was an article on Gothic architecture for Smith's Panorama of Arts and Sciences (Liverpool). This was separately published in 1817 as An Attempt to Discriminate the Styles of English Architecture from the Conquest to the Reformation, the first systematic treatise on Gothic architecture and a milestone in the Gothic Revival. It ran through many editions and provided the basis of Rickman's public reputation. He was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in 1829. Rickman's architectural practice St Peter ad Vincula, Hampton Lucy is a Grade I listed building. As an architect, Rickman was self-taught. When in the Church Building Act of 1818 a large grant of money was set by the government to build new \\"Waterloo churches\\", Rickman sent in a design of his own which was successful in an open competition; thus he was fairly launched upon the profession of an architect, for which his natural gifts strongly fitted him. Rickman then moved to Birmingham where he designed the St George's Church (demolished in 1960) for the city. The design also consisted of churchyard gates, completed in 1822, which remain today. By 1830 Rickman had become one of the most successful architects of his time. He built churches at Hampton Lucy, Ombersley, and Stretton-on-Dunsmore, St George's at Birmingham, St Philip's, St Mary the Virgin and St Matthew's in Bristol, two in Carlisle, St Peter's and St Paul's at Preston, St David's in Glasgow, Grey Friars at Coventry, St Michael's Church, Aigburth and many others. He also designed New Court of St John's College, Cambridge, a palace for the bishop of Carlisle, and several large country houses. Rickman's Henbury School (1830) (now Henbury Village Hall). Holy Trinity, Bristol: one of Rickman's \\"Waterloo churches\\". Rickman attracted a large share of the Church Building Commission's patronage in the new churches built in the West Midlands pursuant to the Church Building Act of 1818. Rickman's transitional Gothic style, that later designers looked down on as \\"Church Commissioners' Gothic\\", did not stand the more rigorous scrutiny of better-informed historicists in the age of photography. The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 1911 said of his churches \\"These are all in the Gothic style, but show more knowledge of the outward form of the medieval style than any real acquaintance with its spirit, and are little better than dull copies of old work, disfigured by much poverty of detail.\\" A later, more generous critic, Sir Howard Colvin, has remarked: :\\"He was no ecclesiologist. If the detailing of his buildings was unusually scholarly, the planning remained Georgian, and the total effect of most of his churches is thin and brittle, if by no means unattractive\\"H. Colvin, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects 1600‚Äì1840 3rd ed. sub \\"Thomas Rickman\\", p 813. Rickman nevertheless played an important part in the revival of taste for medievalism, perhaps second only to Pugin. Henry Hutchinson partnered with Rickman in December 1821 and formed a practice called Rickman and Hutchinson. Rickman remained in this practice until Hutchinson's death in 1831. Death and burial Tomb of Thomas Rickman in the former churchyard of St George in the Fields, Hockley Rickman died at Birmingham on 4 January 1841. He was buried in the churchyard of the church he had designed: St George's Church. His tomb, designed by R. C. Hussey and completed in 1845, still stands, although the church does not. Personal life Rickman was married three times: first to his cousin, Lucy Rickman of Lewes; secondly to Christiana Hornor; and thirdly to Elizabeth Miller of Edinburgh, by whom he had a son, the architect Thomas Miller Rickman (1827‚Äì1912), and a daughter.

Wollheim's short story of the same name, and starring Mira Sorvino, Jeremy Northam, Josh Brolin, Charles S. Dutton, Giancarlo Giannini and F. Murray Abraham. The film features Norman Reedus in his Hollywood debut. Plot In Manhattan, cockroaches are spreading the deadly \\"Strickler's disease\\" that is claiming hundreds of the city's children. Dr. Peter Mann, Deputy Director of the CDC, recruits entomologist Dr. Susan Tyler, who uses genetic engineering to create what she calls the Judas breed, a hybrid between a mantis and a termite that releases an enzyme which accelerates the roaches' metabolism, thus causing them to starve to death faster than they can nourish themselves. The disease is successfully eradicated, and Peter and Susan later marry. Three years later, a priest is chased and dragged underground by a strange assailant. The only witness is Chuy, the autistic ward of an immigrant subway shoe shiner named Manny. Two kids later sell a \\"weird bug\\" from the subway to Susan, which she performs tests on, and realizes is similar to the Judas breed. Initially, she believes that this is impossible, since the specimens she released were all-female and designed with a lifespan of only a few months, ensuring that the breed would die off after a single generation. She later consults with her mentor, Dr. Gates, who autopsies a larger specimen found in the city's sewage treatment plants, and finds that its organs are fully formed, meaning the Judas breed is not only alive, but has developed into a viable species, with a sizable colony underneath the city. Looking for more valuable specimens, the kids go down the tracks where they find a large egg sac and are then killed by the same strange assailant. Chuy also enters the church to find \\"Mr. Funny Shoes\\" and is abducted. Peter, his assistant Josh and MTA officer Leonard enter the maintenance tunnels to investigate but Peter and Leonard get stuck and send Josh for help. Susan encounters what appears to be a shadowy man in a trench coat on a train platform. As she approaches, it unfolds into an insect the size of a human being which has evolved to appear human. The creature abducts Susan and carries her into the tunnels. Meanwhile, Josh finds a way out but is found by a Judas and killed. Manny also enters the tunnels in search of Chuy and comes across Susan, whom he rescues along with Peter and Leonard, and they barricade themselves inside a train car. Susan surmises that the Judas breed's accelerated metabolism has allowed them to reproduce at a similarly accelerated rate, and have managed to evolve over tens of thousands of generations within only three years, including developing the ability to mimic their human prey. The group formulates a plan to get the car moving: Peter will switch the power on, and Manny will switch the tracks. Susan projects that the Judas will spread throughout the tunnels and overrun the city unless they are able to kill the colony's single fertile male. Manny finds Chuy but is killed by the male Judas, so Susan goes in search of him but finds only Chuy. Leonard's injured leg starts bleeding heavily, so he creates a diversion that allows the others to get away, before being killed. Peter finds a dumbwaiter and puts Susan and Chuy in it, but stays behind to destroy the breed for good. He is chased into a room where hundreds are nesting, and blows them all up by setting fire to a loose gas pipe, before diving underwater to safety. The male Judas escapes the blast and goes after Chuy but is distracted by Susan, who lures it into the path of an oncoming train, which runs over it. The two successfully make it to the surface where they are reunited with Peter; Susan assumed that he had died in the blast.

However, Luppi's English pronunciation was not good enough for the film, so del Toro chose Giancarlo Giannini instead; in a 2013 interview del Toro confirmed the story and stated that what he misses the most about working in the Spanish language is the possibility of directing Luppi, for whom del Toro professes the utmost admiration.Guillermo del Toro: ‚ÄúI have no interest in normal superheroes‚Äù 2013-07-17, Clar√≠n Two of the film's actors, Josh Brolin and Alix Koromzay, had previously starred in Nightwatch, another Dimension/Miramax horror film from 1997. Its director, Ole Bornedal, served as a producer on Mimic. =Filming= Principal photography occurred in Toronto, Canada, due to the city's similarities to New York. The film includes several examples of del Toro's most characteristic hallmarks. \\"I have a sort of a fetish for insects, clockwork, monsters, dark places, and unborn things,\\" said del Toro, and this is evident in Mimic, where at times all are combined in long, brooding shots of dark, cluttered, muddy chaotic spaces. According to Alfonso Cuar√≥n, del Toro's friend and colleague, \\"with Guillermo the shots are almost mathematical ‚Äî everything is planned.\\" After Miramax boss Bob Weinstein saw early footage, there were fights between him and del Toro regarding the tone, with Weinstein claiming the film was not scary enough. It has been reported that one day Weinstein was so infuriated with del Toro that he stormed onto the Toronto set and attempted to instruct del Toro on \\"how to direct a movie.\\" Weinstein would eventually try to get del Toro fired. Following an intervention from lead actress Mira Sorvino, Weinstein backed down, and principal photography would be completed with del Toro as director in early 1997. However, Weinstein still insisted on having control over the final cut. Producer B.J. Rack later compared making the film to \\"being a prisoner of [a] war camp\\", while del Toro stated in 2018 \\"The only time I have experienced bad behaviour, and It remains one of the worst experiences of my life, was in 1997, when I did Mimic for Miramax. It was a horrible, horrible, horrible experience.\\" Release and reception Mimic received mixed reviews from critics. It currently holds a 64% 'Fresh' rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 42 reviews, with an average score of 6.42 out of 10. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"Mimic finds director Guillermo del Toro struggling to inject his unique sensibilities into a studio picture - and delivering just enough genre thrills to recommend.\\" Roger Ebert gave the movie 3 1/2 stars saying \\"Del Toro is a director with a genuine visual sense, with a way of drawing us into his story and evoking the mood with the very look and texture of his shots. He takes the standard ingredients and presents them so effectively that \\"Mimic\\" makes the old seem new, fresh and scary.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C-\\" on an A+ to F scale. Due to not being granted final cut privilege, del Toro did not approve of the film as released. In 2010, del Toro revealed that he had been working on a director's cut of Mimic and said \\"It‚Äôs not exactly the movie I wanted to do, but it definitely healed a lot of wounds... I am happy with the cut.\\" The director's cut runs for 112 minutes, six minutes longer than the theatrical release. It was released in 2011, initially exclusive to Blu-ray and is now available via various digital services, but has never been widely available on DVD. =Box office= According to Box Office Mojo, its domestic gross is $25,480,490; it did not beat its budget of $30,000,000. Related works Mimic was planned as one of three 30-minute short films intended to be shown together. It was expanded into a full-length movie, as was Impostor. The short film Alien Love Triangle remains a 30-minute short film, and has never been released.

Broodthaers' tombstone, designed by the artist himself, Ixelles Cemetery, Brussels Marcel Broodthaers (28 January 1924 ‚Äì 28 January 1976) was a Belgian poet, filmmaker and artist with a highly literate and often witty approach to creating art works. Life and career Broodthaers was born in Brussels, Belgium, where he was associated with the Groupe Surr√©aliste-revolutionnaire from 1945 and dabbled in journalism, film, and poetry. After spending 20 years in poverty as a struggling poet,Oxford Art Online; Essay on Broodthaers by Michael Compton at the end of 1963 he decided to become an artist and began to make objects.Marcel Broodthaers Tate. He performed the symbolic act of embedding fifty unsold copies of his book of poems Pense-B√™te in plaster, creating his first art object. That same year, 1964, for his first exhibition, he wrote an infamous introduction that was printed onto pages cut from magazines that doubled as the exhibition's public announcement: > \\"I, too, wondered whether I could not sell something and succeed in life. > For some time I had been no good at anything. I am forty years old... > Finally the idea of inventing something insincere crossed my mind and I set > to work straightaway.

Broodthaers later worked principally with assemblies of found objects and collage, often containing written texts. He incorporated written language in his art and used whatever was at hand for his raw materials‚Äîmost notably the shells of eggs and mussels, but also furniture, clothing, garden tools, household gadgets and reproductions of artworks.Suzanne Muchnich (18 July 1989), Sincerely Insincere Los Angeles Times. In his Visual Tower (1966), Broodthaers made a seven-story circular tower of wood. He filled each story with uniform glass jars, and in every jar he placed an identical image taken from an illustrated magazine, of the eye of a beautiful young woman.John Russell (23 April 1989), An Antic, Insubordinate Performer Babel? New York Times. For Surface de moules (avec sac) (Surface of mussels (with bag)) (1966), he glued mussels in resin on a square panel;Souren Melikian (28 June 2012), Modern Blue Chips Avert Downturn New York Times. in 1974 the artist added a discreet metal hook to the centre of the work designed to support a shopping bag filled with mussel shells.Marcel Broodthaers, Surface de moules (avec sac) (Surface of mussels (with bag)) (1966) Christie's Post-War and Contemporary Art Evening Auction, 27 June 2012, London. From 1968 to 1975 Broodthaers produced large-scale environmental pieces that reworked the very notion of the museum. His most noted work was an installation which began in his Brussels house which he called Mus√©e d'Art Moderne, D√©partment des Aigles (1968), containing different representations of eagles in glass cases that were accompanied by signs that asserted \\"This is not a work of art\\", implying that museums obscure the ideological functioning of images by imposing illegitimate classifications of value. This installation was followed by a further eleven manifestations of the 'museum', including at the Kunsthalle D√ºsseldorf for an exhibition in 1970 and at documenta 5 in Kassel in 1972. In 1970 Broodthaers conceived of the Financial Section, which encompassed an attempt to sell the museum \\"on account of bankruptcy.\\" The sale was announced on the cover of the Art Cologne fair catalogue in 1971, but no buyers were found. As part of the Financial Section, the artist also produced an unlimited edition of gold ingots stamped with the museum's emblem, an eagle, a symbol associated with power and victory. The ingots were sold to raise money for the museum, at a price calculated by doubling the market value of gold, the surcharge representing the bar's value as art.Marcel Broodthaers, Mus√©e d'Art Moderne, D√©partement des Aigles, Section Financi√®re (Museum of Modern Art, Department of Eagles, Financial Section) (1970-1971) Museum of Modern Art, New York. In 1974, Broodthaers launched three separate exhibitions in the same week, each consisting of a new type of installation artwork he referred to as \\"d√©cors\\". The venues of these exhibitions were Wide White Space in Antwerp, Catalogue-Catalogus at Palais de Beaux-Arts Brussels, and Eloge du sujet at Kunstmuseum Basel. In 1975 Broodthaers presented the exhibition \\"L‚ÄôAngelus de Daumier\\" at the Centre National d‚ÄôArt Contemporain in Paris, at which each room had the name of a colour.Marcel Broodthaers, La Salle blanche (1975) MACBA, Barcelona. In La Salle Blanche (The White Room) (1975), a life- size copy of a room and a half in Broodthaers' home in Brussels, the wooden walls of the empty, unfurnished rooms are covered with printed words in French‚Äîsuch as museum, gallery, oil, subject, composition, images, and privilege‚Äîall intended to examine \\"the influence of language on perceptions of the world and the ways museums affect the production and consumption of art.\\"Michael Brenson (15 June 1984), For Jean Cocteau, Word Was Multifarious New York Times. For such works he is associated with the late 20th century global spread of both installation art as well as \\"institutional critique,\\" in which interrelationships between artworks, the artist, and the museum are a focus. Indeed, Broodthaers' Mus√©e d'Art Moderne, his \\"first fictional museum,\\" allowed him to simultaneously posture as artist, director, curator and trustee in a self-reflexive examination of the order and prescriptions implicit in the production of museum exhibits. From late 1969, Broodthaers lived mainly in D√ºsseldorf, Berlin, and finally London. He died of a liver disease in Cologne, Germany on his 52nd birthday. He is buried at Ixelles Cemetery in Brussels under a tombstone of his own design which was realized by Karel Van Roy, sculptor in Beernem, Belgium. Exhibitions In 1980, the exhibition \\"Marcel Broodthaers\\" was mounted by the Tate Gallery, London. Other important retrospectives of Broodthaers' work have been held at the Walker Art Center (1989), Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (1989); Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh (1989); Jeu de Paume, Paris (1991); and Palais des Beaux Arts, Brussels (2000). The most recent traveling survey was organized by the Museum of Modern Art, New York and the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof√≠a, Madrid in 2016. The show also traveled to the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein- Westfalen, D√ºsseldorf in 2017. An important solo exhibition of the film work, \\"Marcel Broodthaers: Cin√©ma\\", was shown at Fundacio Antoni T√†pies, Barcelona; Centro Galego de Arte Contempor√°nea, Santiago de Compostela, and Kunsthalle D√ºsseldorf (1997). The first Solo Show in Austria was presented 2003 at Kunsthalle Vienna. In 2015 the Fridericianum presented a comprehensive retrospective featuring works from all of the artist's creative periods. \\"Marcel Broodthaers: A Retrospective\\" at the Museum of Modern Art, New York was the first Broodthaers retrospective organized in New York. This solo exhibition was at the Museum of Modern Art, New York 14 February ‚Äì 15 May 2016 and then traveled to Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof√≠a, Madrid, in October 2016, and to the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, D√ºsseldorf in the Spring of 2017. There have been many notable international group exhibitions, including documenta 10, 7 and 5, Kassel (1997, 1982, and 1972).Marcel Broodthaers: SECTION CIN√âMA, 9 September ‚Äì 16 October 2010 Marian Goodman Gallery, New York/Paris. Publishing As a poet and political activist, Broodthaers had a life-long interest in the circulatory power of printed matter: posters, graphics, editions, and artist books. In addition to the prospect of commercial galleries selling limited editions, the artist's books Broodthaers published with nonprofit institutions like Kunstalle D√ºsseldorf, the Deutsche Academischer Austaudienst (DAAD), Berlin, the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, and the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris, merged his monetary ambitions with his conceptual and philosophical ideas. For example, Broodthaers' catalogue for Der Adler von Oligiz√§n bis heute, the seminal culmination of his Musee d'Art Moderne, department des Aigles, at Kunstalle D√ºsseldorf in 1972, was published in two volumes. Volume I featured a scholarly index of the items on display and was for sale at the opening of the exhibition, replete with a coupon that could be redeemed later for Volume II, which featured views of the installation and came out at the close of the exhibition. Broodthaers returned to this motif for his artist's book Photographieren Verboten/No Photographs Allowed but aimed it at the convention of the exhibition catalogue, with version one published by the DAAD, Berlin, and version two by the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford. The Oxford book presents ostensibly the same content as the DAAD book but scrambles the internal logic of the book, changing the context of its standard component parts‚Äîtitle page, checklist, scholarly essay, curriculum vitae‚Äîand thus the implications of each. Content normally reserved for the rear of an exhibition catalogue (in this case the artist's cv) appears on the inside front cover as a decorative pattern, and scholarly content such as the catalogue essay appears on the outside back cover like an advertising blurb.

As head of the Leopoldian line, he ruled over the Inner Austrian duchies of Carinthia, Styria and Carniola as well as the County of Tyrol and Further Austria from 1396 until his death.  Biography  Born in Vienna, William was the oldest son of Duke Leopold III of Austria (1351‚Äì1386) and his consort Viridis Visconti (1352‚Äì1414), a daughter of Lord Bernab√≤ of Milan. Leopold III had already acted as regent over the Tyrol and the Further Austrian possessions in Swabia; in 1379 he signed the Treaty of Neuberg with his elder brother Duke Albert III, whereupon he also received the Inner Austrian lands. At the age of 14, William was betrothed to the Anjou princess Hedwig (Jadwiga; 1373‚Äì1399), the youngest daughter of King Louis I of Hungary, who had also become King of Poland in 1370. This was one of the first attempts of the Habsburgs to extend their dominions by marrying heiresses, as Louis intended his elder daughter Mary and her fianc√© Sigismund of Luxembourg to succeed in Poland, while Jadwiga was designated heir to the Kingdom of Hungary. When King Louis died in 1382, Mary succeeded in Hungary. However, the Polish nobles rejected Mary and Sigismund, and instead chose Jadwiga as queen regnant. They also repudiated her betrothal to William and enforced the break-up of the engagement. Seal of William of Austria In 1386, Leopold III was killed in the Battle of Sempach. William and his brother Leopold IV succeeded him as Duke of Austria, ruling jointly with their uncle Albert III. A fierce inheritance dispute arose when Duke Albert III died in 1395 and was succeeded by his only son Albert IV, William's first cousin. An agreement was reached in the following year, based on the 1379 Treaty of Neuberg, whereupon William left the rule over Austria proper to Albert IV and, as eldest members of the Habsburg Leopoldian line, went on to rule over the three Inner Austrian duchies and the County of Tyrol taking his residence in Graz. In 1401, William married another presumptive heiress, Princess Joanna of Naples, Hedwig's cousin and also of Angevin descent. The marriage did not produce any offspring and William did not live to see his wife succeed her brother Ladislaus of Naples as Queen Joanna II in 1414. In 1404, his cousin Albert IV died, leaving the lands of the elder Albertinian line to his seven-year-old son Duke Albert V. William acted as an Austrian regent and again tried to take the Albertinian territories from his minor nephew, but did not succeed before his death. William died in 1406 without heirs in Vienna. He is buried in the Ducal Crypt in Vienna's St. Stephen's Cathedral. Upon his death, another division of the Habsburg hereditary lands took place, whereafter William's brother Leopold IV took over the regency in Austria proper, the third-born Ernest the Iron inherited the Inner Austrian duchies, and Frederick IV, the youngest, Tyrol and Further Austria.

Previously, it had been the official anthem of the African National Congress since 1925. Early life and education Sontonga, a Xhosa, was born in the city of Uitenhage in the Eastern Cape Colony. He trained as a teacher at the Lovedale Institution and subsequently worked as a teacher and choirmaster at the Methodist Mission school in Nancefield, near Johannesburg for eight years.Enoch Mankayti Sontonga, SAHistory.org.za, accessed July 2013 Career The first verse and chorus of \\"Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika\\" was composed in 1897 and it was originally intended to be a school anthem. Some sources say he wrote the tune the same year,Remembering Sontonga, SouthAfrica.info, accessed July 2013 but others contend that the tune was written by Joseph Parry as \\"Aberystwyth\\" and that Sontonga merely wrote new words.Joseph Parry's Te Deum: Premiere for lost composition, James McLaren, \\"012, BBC News, retrieved 22 June 2014 It was first sung in public in 1899 at the ordination of Reverend Mboweni, who was the first Tsonga Methodist minister. Later the Xhosa poet Samuel Mqhayi wrote a further seven verses. Sontonga died in April 1905. Personal life Sontonga married Diana Mngqibisa and had a son. His wife died in 1929. Legacy The song started to be more well known after John Langalibalele Dube's Ohlange Institute's choir used it. They played it at the South African Native National Congress meeting in 1912. It was sung after the closing prayer and the ANC adopted it as its official closing anthem in 1925. It was recorded in London as \\"Nkosi sikelel‚Äô iAfrika\\" in 1923 and it was published by the Lovedale Press in 1927. For many years, the site of Sontonga's grave was unknown, but it was finally located in the \\"Native Christian\\" section of the Braamfontein cemetery in the early-1990s. One of the reasons why the location of his grave remained a mystery is that it was listed under the name \\"Enoch\\" and not by his surname \\"Sontonga\\". On 24 September 1996, Sontonga's grave was declared a national monument and a memorial on the site was unveiled by then-President Nelson Mandela. At the same ceremony, the South African Order of Meritorious Service (Gold) was bestowed on Enoch Sontonga posthumously.

Lucile Packard Children‚Äôs Hospital at Stanford. Retrieved 3 March 2013. A partial dislocation is referred to as a subluxation. Dislocations are often caused by sudden trauma on the joint like an impact or fall. A joint dislocation can cause damage to the surrounding ligaments, tendons, muscles, and nerves.Smith, R. L., & Brunolli, J. J. (1990). Shoulder kinesthesia after anterior glenohumeral joint dislocation. Journal of Orthopaedic & Sports Physical Therapy, 11(11), 507‚Äì513. Dislocations can occur in any joint major (shoulder, knees, etc.) or minor (toes, fingers, etc.). The most common joint dislocation is a shoulder dislocation. Treatment for joint dislocation is usually by closed reduction, that is, skilled manipulation to return the bones to their normal position. Reduction should only be performed by trained medical professionals, because it can cause injury to soft tissue and/or the nerves and vascular structures around the dislocation. Symptoms The following symptoms are common with any type of dislocation. * Intense pain * Joint instability * Deformity of the joint area * Reduced muscle strength * Bruising or redness of joint area * Difficulty moving joint * Stiffness Causes Joint dislocations are caused by trauma to the joint or when an individual falls on a specific joint. Great and sudden force applied, by either a blow or fall, to the joint can cause the bones in the joint to be displaced or dislocated from normal position. With each dislocation, the ligaments keeping the bones fixed in the correct position can be damaged or loosened, making it easier for the joint to be dislocated in the future. Some individuals are prone to dislocations due to congenital conditions, such as hypermobility syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. Hypermobility syndrome is genetically inherited disorder that is thought to affect the encoding of the connective tissue protein‚Äôs collagen in the ligament of joints.Ruemper, A. & Watkins, K. (2012). Correlations between general joint hypermobility and joint hypermobility syndrome and injury in contemporary dance students. Journal of Dance Medicine & Science, 16(4): 161‚Äì166. The loosened or stretched ligaments in the joint provide little stability and allow for the joint to be easily dislocated. Diagnosis Initial evaluation of a suspected joint dislocation should begin with a thorough patient history, including mechanism of injury, and physical examination. Special attention should be focused on the neurovascular exam both before and after reduction, as injury to these structures may occur during the injury or during the reduction process. Subsequent imaging studies are frequently obtained to assist with diagnosis. * Standard plain radiographs, usually a minimum of 2 views ** Generally, pre- and post-reduction X-rays are recommended. Initial X-ray can confirm the diagnosis as well as evaluate for any concomitant fractures. Post-reduction radiographs confirm successful reduction alignment and can exclude any other bony injuries that may have been caused during the reduction procedure. ** In certain instances if initial X-rays are normal but injury is suspected, there is possible benefit of stress/weight-bearing views to further assess for disruption of ligamentous structures and/or need for surgical intervention. This may be utilized with AC joint separations. ** Nomenclature: Joint dislocations are named based on the distal component in relation to the proximal one. * Ultrasound ** Ultrasound may be useful in an acute setting, particularly with suspected shoulder dislocations. Although it may not be as accurate in detecting any associated fractures, in one observational study ultrasonography identified 100% of shoulder dislocations, and was 100% sensitive in identifying successful reduction when compared to plain radiographs. Ultrasound may also have utility in diagnosing AC joint dislocations. ** In infants <6 months of age with suspected developmental dysplasia of the hip (congenital hip dislocation), ultrasound is the imaging study of choice as the proximal femoral epiphysis has not significantly ossified at this age. * Cross-sectional imaging (CT or MRI) ** Plain films are generally sufficient in making a joint dislocation diagnosis. However, cross- sectional imaging can subsequently be used to better define and evaluate abnormalities that may be missed or not clearly seen on plain X-rays. CT is useful in further analyzing any bony aberrations, and CT angiogram may be utilized if vascular injury is suspected. In addition to improved visualization of bony abnormalities, MRI permits for a more detailed inspection of the joint-supporting structures in order to assess for ligamentous and other soft tissue injury. Treatment A dislocated joint usually can be successfully reduced into its normal position only by a trained medical professional. Trying to reduce a joint without any training could substantially worsen the injury.Bankart, A. (2004). The pathology and treatment of recurrent dislocation of the shoulder-joint. Acta Orthop Belg. 70: 515‚Äì519 X-rays are usually taken to confirm a diagnosis and detect any fractures which may also have occurred at the time of dislocation. A dislocation is easily seen on an X-ray.Dias, J., Steingold, R., Richardson, R., Tesfayohannes, B., Gregg, P. (1987). The conservative treatment of acromioclavicular dislocation. British Editorial Society of Bone and Joint Surgery. 69(5): 719‚Äì722. Once a diagnosis is confirmed, the joint is usually manipulated back into position. This can be a very painful process, therefore this is typically done either in the emergency department under sedation or in an operating room under a general anaesthetic.Holdsworth, F. (1970). Fractures, dislocations, and fracture dislocations of the spine. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. 52 (8): 1534‚Äì1551. It is important the joint is reduced as soon as possible, as in the state of dislocation, the blood supply to the joint (or distal anatomy) may be compromised. This is especially true in the case of a dislocated ankle, due to the anatomy of the blood supply to the foot.Ganz, R., Gill, T., Gautier, E., Ganz, K., Krugel, N., Berlemann, U. (2001). Surgical dislocation of the adult hip. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. 83(8): 1119‚Äì1124. Shoulder injuries can also be surgically stabilized, depending on the severity, using arthroscopic surgery. The most common treatment method for a dislocation of the Glenohumeral Joint (GH Joint/Shoulder Joint) is exercise based management. Another method of treatment is to place the injured arm in a sling or in another immobilizing device in order to keep the joint stable. Some joints are more at risk of becoming dislocated again after an initial injury. This is due to the weakening of the muscles and ligaments which hold the joint in place. The shoulder is a prime example of this. Any shoulder dislocation should be followed up with thorough physiotherapy. On field reduction is crucial for joint dislocations. As they are extremely common in sports events, managing them correctly at the game at the time of injury, can reduce long term issues. They require prompt evaluation, diagnosis, reduction, and postreduction management before the person can be evaluated at a medical facility. =After care= After a dislocation, injured joints are usually held in place by a splint (for straight joints like fingers and toes) or a bandage (for complex joints like shoulders). Additionally, the joint muscles, tendons and ligaments must also be strengthened. This is usually done through a course of physiotherapy, which will also help reduce the chances of repeated dislocations of the same joint.Itoi, E., Hatakeyama, Y., Kido, T., Sato, T., Minagawa, H., Wakabayashi, I., Kobayashi, M. (2003). Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery. 12(5): 413‚Äì415. For glenohumeral instability, the therapeutic program depends on specific characteristics of the instability pattern, severity, recurrence and direction with adaptations made based on the needs of the patient. In general, the therapeutic program should focus on restoration of strength, normalization of range of motion and optimization of flexibility and muscular performance. Throughout all stages of the rehabilitation program, it is important to take all related joints and structures into consideration. Epidemiology * Each joint in the body can be dislocated, however, there are common sites where most dislocations occur. The following structures are the most common sites of joint dislocations: * Dislocated shoulder ** Shoulder dislocations account for 45% of all dislocation visits to the emergency room. Anterior shoulder dislocation, the most common type of shoulder dislocation (96-98% of the time) occurs when the arm is in external rotation and abduction (away from the body) produces a force that displaces the humeral head anteriorly and downwardly. Vessel and nerve injuries during a shoulder dislocation is rare, but can cause many impairments and requires a longer recovery process. There is a 39% average rate of recurrence of anterior shoulder dislocation, with age, sex, hyperlaxity and greater tuberosity fractures being the key risk factors. * Knee: Patellar dislocation ** Many different knee injuries can happen. Three percent of knee injuries are acute traumatic patellar dislocations. Because dislocations make the knee unstable, 15% of patellas will re-dislocate. ** Patellar dislocations occur when the knee is in full extension and sustains a trauma from the lateral to medial side. * Elbow: Posterior dislocation, 90% of all elbow dislocations * Wrist: Lunate and Perilunate dislocation most common * Finger: Interphalangeal (IP) or metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint dislocations ** In the United States, men are most likely to sustain a finger dislocation with an incidence rate of 17.8 per 100,000 person-years. Women have an incidence rate of 4.65 per 100,000 person-years. The average age group that sustain a finger dislocation are between 15 and 19 years old. * Hip: Posterior and anterior dislocation of hip ** Anterior dislocations are less common than posterior dislocations. 10% of all dislocations are anterior and this is broken down into superior and inferior types. Superior dislocations account for 10% of all anterior dislocations, and inferior dislocations account for 90%. 16-40 year old males are more likely to receive dislocations due to a car accident. When an individual receives a hip dislocation, there is an incidence rate of 95% that they will receive an injury to another part of their body as well. 46‚Äì84% of hip dislocations occur secondary to traffic accidents, the remaining percentage is due based on falls, industrial accidents or sporting injury. * Foot and Ankle: ** Lisfranc injury is a dislocation or fracture-dislocation injury at the tarsometatarsal joints ** Subtalar dislocation, or talocalcaneonavicular dislocation, is a simultaneous dislocation of the talar joints at the talocalcaneal and talonavicular levels. Subtalar dislocations without associated fractures represent about 1% of all traumatic injuries of the foot and 1-2 % of all dislocations, and they are associated with high energy trauma. Early closed reduction is recommended, otherwise open reduction without further delay. ** Total talar dislocation is very rare and has very high rates of complications.For a graphic representation of displacements that may lead to a total talar dislocation see: ** Ankle Sprains primarily occur as a result of tearing the ATFL (anterior talofibular ligament) in the Talocrural Joint. The ATFL tears most easily when the foot is in plantarflexion and inversion. ** Ankle dislocation without fracture is rare.

He published extensively in entomology and founded the Entomology Department at the University of California, Berkeley. He was the first person to breed the model organism Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) in captivity and to suggest to early genetic researchers at Harvard its use for scientific research. He spent four years at the University of Nanking, China, where he effected the practical control of the city's mosquitoes. He drafted and lobbied for California's first insecticide law and administered the law for 12 years. The Pacific Branch of the Entomological Society of America named its annual career achievement award the C. W. Woodworth Award. Birth and early life He was born in Champaign, Illinois on April 28, 1865 to Alvin Oakley Woodworth and Mary Celina (Carpenter) Woodworth. His father was a merchant but died when Charles was four. Some years later, his mother married Alvin's older brother Stephen Elias Woodworth to help raise Charles and his older brother Howard. Stephen had earlier been a resident of Seneca Falls, New York and was a signatory of the 1848 Seneca Falls Declaration of Sentiments.Signatories of the Declaration of Sentiments Career overview Charles graduated with a BS in 1885 and an MS in 1886 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The funds received from the judgment in the 1884 U.S. Supreme Court Case, New England Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Woodworth, may have helped pay for his education. During the period of 1884‚Äì1886, he was assistant to S.A. Forbes. From 1886 to 1888 he studied at Harvard University under Hermann August Hagen, who, at the time, was the leading entomologist of the U.S. He returned between 1900 and 1901 and worked under William E. Castle. In 1888, he was appointed entomologist and botanist at the University of Arkansas's Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station.History of Entomology at the University of Arkansas On September 4, 1889, he married Leonora Stern in Rolla, Missouri, the city where her parents, Edward Stern and Lizzie Hardin Evans Stern, lived. Charles suffered from successive attacks of malaria while in Arkansas. He left there in 1891 to become assistant in entomology at the University of California (now UC Berkeley) where he founded and built up the Division of Entomology.History of Entomology at U.C. Berkeley He also participated in the development of the Agricultural Experiment Station, now known as UC Davis, and is also considered the founder of the Entomology Department there. At Berkeley, he rose to be Assistant Professor in 1891, Associate Professor in 1904, Professor in 1913, and was named Emeritus Professor upon his retirement in 1930.12/20/1940 Science Magazine Obituary Proposal on the use of Drosophila Woodworth is credited with first breeding Drosophila in quantity while he was at Harvard. Thomas Hunt Morgan's Nobel Prize biography says that Woodworth suggested to William E. Castle that Drosophila might be used for genetical work.T.H. Morgan's Nobel Prize biography mentioning C. W. Woodworth Castle and his associates used it for their work on the effects of inbreeding, and through them F. E. Lutz became interested in it and the latter introduced it to Morgan, who was looking for a species that could be bred in the very limited space at his command. Four years in China While on sabbatical leave in 1918, he was a lecturer at the University of Nanking and honorary professor of entomology at the National Southeastern University at Nanking, China. During his year there he effected a practical control of mosquitoes for the first time in that city's history. He returned for a three-year period in 1921‚Äì1924. During this period he organized the Kiangsu Provincial Bureau of Entomology as well as many other things. In the words of the president of the University of Nanking, \\"He served China in a magnificent way.\\" Publications and policy efforts His publications were very extensive and included nearly every field of entomology. A few of his most outstanding works are: \\"A List of the Insects of California (1903), The Wing Veins of Insects\\" (1906), \\"Guide to California Insects\\" (1913),Guide to California insects Cornell University Library Historical Monographs Collection] and \\"School of Fumigation\\" (1915). He was the first editor and first contributor to the University of California Publications in Entomology. He had much to do with the responsible use of pesticides. He proposed and drafted the first California Insecticide Law in 1906, was largely instrumental in securing its passage in 1911, and administered the law until July 1, 1923. Entomological campaigns which he conducted in California concerned the codling moth, the peach twig-borer, citrus insects, grasshoppers, and citrus white fly eradication. Family and home Charles and Leonora had four children: Lawrence, Harold, Charles, and Elizabeth. His son, Dr. Charles E. Woodworth, also became an entomologist; he worked for the USDA ARS focusing on the wireworm and served as an entomologist with the Army in the Pacific during World War II with the rank of Major, commanding a unit which cleared swamps. Their home at 2237 Carleton Street in Berkeley, that he designed, was designated a Berkeley Landmark in 1993.Photo of the Woodworth family home in Berkeley which he designedCity of Berkeley Landmark listing of his home He had many avocations including making telescopes,3/30/1930 NY Times archive article about the multi-element telescope that he was building analyzing chess positions, and researching his extended family's genealogy. The C.W.

The group works at both national and European levels. History The roots of the European Round Table of Industrialists date back to the early 1980s. The European economy at that time, was regarded as suffering from eurosclerosis, which was perceived as a lack of dynamism, innovation and competitiveness when compared with the economies of Japan and the United States. The negative economic consequences of the competitive situation worried several leading European businesspeople. At the initiative of Pehr G. Gyllenhammar, the CEO of Volvo, 17 European businessmen met in the Paris boardroom of Volvo on 6 and 7 April 1983. They envisioned to create an organisation, which would be able to convey its message about the state of the economy to the European political leaders. The core message was that Europe needed to modernise its industrial bases in order to regain its competitiveness. The industry perceived a lack of a common European industrial development policy, in contrast to the European agricultural policy. The meeting in Paris was attended by Pehr G. Gyllenhammar (Volvo), Karl Beurle (Thyssen), Carlo De Benedetti (Olivetti), Curt Nicolin (ASEA), Harry Gray (United Technologies), John Harvey - Jones (ICI), Wolfgang Seelig (Siemens), Umberto Agnelli (Fiat), Peter Baxendell (Shell), Olivier Lecerf (Lafarge Copp√©e), Jos√© Bidegain (Cie de St Gobain), Wisse Dekker (Philips), Antoine Riboud (BSN), Bernard Hanon (Renault), Louis von Planta (Ciba-Geigy) and Helmut Maucher (Nestl√©). Both Fran√ßois-Xavier Ortoli and √âtienne Davignon from the European Commission attended the meeting. At the second meeting, on 1 June 1983 in Amsterdam, the ERT organisation was established, its charter accepted and the necessary financial arrangements were made. The goal of the ERT would be to promote competition and competitiveness on a European scale. At the outset, the group played an important role in the planning of the Oresund Bridge between Denmark and Sweden as part of its European Link project on improvements to the European infrastructure. This project also included several other international European infrastructural projects e.g. the Fehmarn Belt Bridge between Denmark and Germany. Later on the ERT became active in the promotion of the earliest Trans-European Networks. The ERT's busiest decade was 1988 to 1998 under different chairmen: Wisse Dekker (Netherlands), J√©r√¥me Monod (France) and Helmut Maucher (Switzerland) with Keith Richardson as Secretary General. During this time the ERT published influential reports in the domains of Internal Market, Infrastructure, Education, Environment, Information Society, Competitiveness, Job Creation and tax issues. The ERT fostered direct government-industry consultation at many different levels. Its active role in encouraging the first global G8 cooperation on building common standards for the Information Society was recognised by several country leaders, including President Bill Clinton. From early on, ERT policy supported EU enlargement. It promoted and often led business dialogues between the EU and business circles in the US and in Japan as well as in developing countries. The ERT gave an early lead in presenting positive contributions to the climate change debate, and control carbon emissions. Two more recent areas for ERT contribution are pensions and international standards. Chairmen * 1983 - 1988: Pehr G.

Later versions of the aircraft were known as the Vickers Vulture and Vickers Vanellus. Design and development Research on Vickers' first amphibious aircraft type began in December 1918 with tests of alternative fuselage/hull designs occurring in an experimental tank at St Albans in Hertfordshire, England. A prototype, registered G-EAOV, was a five-seat cabin biplane with a pusher propeller driven by a Rolls-Royce Falcon water-cooled V 12 engine. Sir John Alcock died taking this aircraft to the Paris exhibition on 18 December 1919, whilst trying to land at C√¥te d'Evrard, near Rouen, Normandy in foggy weather.Andrews and Morgan 1988, pp. 112‚Äì113.\\"The Death of Sir John Alcock\\". Flight, 25 December 1919, p. 1646. A Royal Air Force Vickers Viking V A Vickers Viking IV of the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1926 Vickers Vulture Vickers Vanellus The next example, G-EASC, known as the Viking II, had a greater wing span and a 360 hp Rolls-Royce Eagle VIII motor. The Viking III machine, piloted by Captain Stan Cockerell, won first prize in the amphibian class in Air Ministry competitions held in September and October, 1920. The Type 54 Viking IV incorporated further refinements and had a wider cabin above a hull one foot wider, an example being G-EBBZ in which Ross Smith and J.M. Bennett (partners in the 1919 England to Australia flight) died on 13 April 1922 just outside the Brooklands racetrack near Weybridge in Surrey. Most of these Mark IV Vikings had a Napier Lion engine.Milberry 1979, p. 30. The next version was the Viking V; two were built for the RAF for service in Iraq. A further development with a redesigned wing structure using the 450 hp (340 kW) Napier Lion would have been the Viking VI (Vickers designation Type 78) but known as the Vulture I. A second with a Rolls-Royce Eagle IX (360 hp, 270 kW) was the Type 95 Vulture II. Both Vultures were used for an unsuccessful around the world attempt in 1924 after the Eagle engine of the Vulture II was replaced with a Lion. With registration G-EBHO, the first set off from Calshot Seaplane Base on 25 March 1924, the other was shipped as a spare machine to Tokyo. After mechanical difficulties in earlier stages G-EBHO crashed at Akyab where it was replaced by G-EBGO on 25 June. Encountering heavy fog on the Siberian side of the Bering Sea G-EBGO crashed. Vickers salvaged a large proportion. The Viking Mark VII (\\"Type 83\\" in Vickers numbering) was a development of the Vulture, a three-seat open-cockpit fleet spotter to Air Ministry specification 46/22 given the service name Vanellus when taken on for evaluation by the RAF against the Supermarine Seagull design. Operational history The last Viking amphibians were built during 1923, but the name was re-used for the twin-engine VC.1 Viking airliner some 22 years later, which saw service as the Valetta with the RAF and other air arms. Some Viking amphibians were built by Canadian Vickers Limited, a subsidiary company in Montreal with no previous aircraft manufacturing experience. Their involvement with the Viking led to a future line of indigenous flying boats beginning with the Canadian Vickers Vedette.Molson and Taylor 1982, p. 174. No Vikings survive today although a full-size replica built for the film The People That Time Forgot (1977) is displayed at Brooklands Museum in Surrey.

It consists of the points of G having values in A; the definition of the appropriate topology is straightforward only in case G is a linear algebraic group. In the case of G being an abelian variety, it presents a technical obstacle, though it is known that the concept is potentially useful in connection with Tamagawa numbers. Adelic algebraic groups are widely used in number theory, particularly for the theory of automorphic representations, and the arithmetic of quadratic forms. In case G is a linear algebraic group, it is an affine algebraic variety in affine N-space. The topology on the adelic algebraic group G(A) is taken to be the subspace topology in AN, the Cartesian product of N copies of the adele ring. In this case, G(A)is a topological group. Ideles An important example, the idele group I(K), is the case of G = GL_1. Here the set of ideles (also id√®les ) consists of the invertible adeles; but the topology on the idele group is not their topology as a subset of the adeles. Instead, considering that GL_1 lies in two- dimensional affine space as the 'hyperbola' defined parametrically by : \\\\\\\\{(t,t^{-1})\\\\\\\\}, the topology correctly assigned to the idele group is that induced by inclusion in A2; composing with a projection, it follows that the ideles carry a finer topology than the subspace topology from A. Inside AN, the product KN lies as a discrete subgroup. This means that G(K) is a discrete subgroup of G(A), also. In the case of the idele group, the quotient group : I(K)/K^\\\\times \\\\, is the idele class group. It is closely related to (though larger than) the ideal class group. The idele class group is not itself compact; the ideles must first be replaced by the ideles of norm 1, and then the image of those in the idele class group is a compact group; the proof of this is essentially equivalent to the finiteness of the class number. The study of the Galois cohomology of idele class groups is a central matter in class field theory. Characters of the idele class group, now usually called Hecke characters, give rise to the most basic class of L-functions. Tamagawa numbers For more general G, the Tamagawa number is defined (or indirectly computed) as the measure of :G(A)/G(K). Tsuneo Tamagawa's observation was that, starting from an invariant differential form œâ on G, defined over K, the measure involved was well-defined: while œâ could be replaced by cœâ with c a non-zero element of K, the product formula for valuations in K is reflected by the independence from c of the measure of the quotient, for the product measure constructed from œâ on each effective factor. The computation of Tamagawa numbers for semisimple groups contains important parts of classical quadratic form theory. History of the terminology Historically the id√®les were introduced by under the name \\"√©l√©ment id√©al\\", which is \\"ideal element\\" in French, which then abbreviated to \\"id√®le\\" following a suggestion of Hasse. (In these papers he also gave the ideles a non-Hausdorff topology.) This was to formulate class field theory for infinite extensions in terms of topological groups. defined (but did not name) the ring of adeles in the function field case and pointed out that Chevalley's group of Idealelemente was the group of invertible elements of this ring. defined the ring of adeles as a restricted direct product, though he called its elements \\"valuation vectors\\" rather than adeles. defined the ring of adeles in the function field case, under the name \\"repartitions\\". The term ad√®le (short for additive id√®les, and also a French woman's name) was in use shortly afterwards and may have been introduced by Andr√© Weil. The general construction of adelic algebraic groups by followed the algebraic group theory founded by Armand Borel and Harish-Chandra.

His eldest brother Duke William of Inner Austria took him as his effective co-ruler, putting him in particular charge of Further Austria, which also meant ancestral Habsburg lands in Swiss Aargau etc. Leopold was to face Swiss opposition to Austrian administration. From 1391 onwards, he was the effective ruler of Further Austria, and from 1396 to 1406 he was ruler in Tyrol too. He married Catherine de Valois of Burgundy, daughter of Philip II, Duke of Burgundy, in 1393. She died in 1425, and they had no surviving children. His younger brothers Ernest the Iron and Frederick were, for the time being, left to grow up. They were initiated with ducal positions in 1402. In 1406 their eldest brother Duke William died without leaving heirs, and Leopold became the next head of their family. Leopold had no sons either. The younger brothers made an agreement how to divide the patrimony in the future: Ernest was to receive Inner Austria and Frederick Further Austria, including Tyrol. Ernest took the reins in Styria, etc. Frederick was only barely in his twenties, but was put in charge in Tyrol. Leopold was left with responsibility of the Further Austrian territories, together with the position of head of the family. In 1406, Leopold took over the guardianship of their young cousin Albert V, which resulted in conflicts with his brother Ernest.

With only one bedroom, plus bedrooms for servants, it was built in 1935 at 10000 Tampa Avenue, Northridge, on a plot of 13 acres (5 hectares) in California's then-rural San Fernando Valley for the movie director Josef von Sternberg. The house was demolished in 1972 and later the land became a housing development. Much of the estate's land had been sold off (mostly for agriculture) decades earlier and its final size was four acres. The design of the house contrasts with most typical homes. It had a very small number of rooms and a relatively small square footage. While it did have a few features of ostentatious display, such as a separate, larger and higher garage bay for a Duesenberg automobile in addition to the two other garage bays for lesser automobiles (in an era where even rich homes had only one or two garages) most of its characteristics were original and discreet, showing Neutra's attention to the integration of custom details, such as the surrounding moats. The exterior of the house was all steel and glass, and the appearance of the house and of its landscaped surroundings was made of sinuous lines, yet the interiors were orthogonal, making furniture placement simple and easy. As in many others of his domestic designs, Neutra made heavy use of industrial windows and sidings, fulfilling both aesthetic and practical functions, such as making privacy screens and windbreaks. Neutra was mindful of his customer's desires even when he found them absurd. He would later regale his friends with the story (among others) of Sternberg asking that none of the bathroom doors should have locks, in order to prevent his party guests from locking themselves in and threatening to commit suicide. As a movie director, Sternberg was well acquainted with the theatrical behavior of many Hollywood actors, while Neutra had a social life which kept him in touch with artists in other domains. In the 1940s, novelist-philosopher Ayn Rand bought the house. Although concerned by the property's 20 mile (32 km) distance from Hollywood, where she worked as a screenwriter, Rand and her husband actor Frank O'Connor paid $24,000 for the house. In 1963, according to Rand's biographer Barbara Branden, she and O'Connor sold the house for $175,000.Branden, The Passion of Ayn Rand, p. 186 The sale was arranged by the post-Rand occupant, author Ruth Beebe Hill, who, along with her husband Buzzy Hill and collaborator Chunksa Uha, rented the house from Rand for many years after Rand moved to New York. It was purchased by the property's next-door neighbor, a Mrs. Houchen, who had it demolished the day after the Hills moved to Washington State, fearing trespass and squatting by \\"hippies.\\" Andy Moore (1956-present), who lived across the street from the house (at the northwest corner of Tampa and Mayall Streets)from 1961-1972 and knew Buzzy and Ruth Hill and Chunksa Uha, shot a Super-8 film, \\"Destruction,\\" of the demolition of the Von Sternberg House: https://andystreasuretrove.com/destruction (also on https://andystreasuretrove.com/films) and YouTube on the Andy's Treasure Trove channel). Several other of Moore's Super-8 films (on YouTube) show the Von Sternberg house in the background, and he was a frequent visitor, and later, groundskeeper there. There had been dozens of peacocks on the property until a mountain lion killed all of them but one, called Pokey, who loved the cherries from the Hills' Manhattan cocktails. Pokey often wandered over to the Moore house and had to be shoo'd back across Tampa Avenue towards home. Hunting through the grounds for Pokey's rainbow-colored feathers during molting season was like hunting for jewels in the forest. The moats were filled with carp and huge bullfrogs, the latter of which made beautiful music in the night. Chunksa Uha taught Andy Moore and his Indian Guides troop an ancient Lakota song that Andy still remembers. Andy also possesses one of the five iconic floodlights that were attached to the home's exterior. Notes *Hines, Thomas. Richard Neutra and the Search for Modern Architecture..

Anglo-Dutch wars Royal Katherine participated in the Second Anglo-Dutch War fighting in the Battle of Lowestoft on 13 June 1665, the Four Days' Battle from 11 June to 14 June 1666 and the St. James's Day Battle on 4 August 1666. She was scuttled in June 1667 to prevent her capture by the Dutch during the Raid on the Medway. Refloated, Royal Katherine fought again during the Third Anglo-Dutch War of 1672‚Äì4. She was captured by the Dutch during the Battle of Solebay on 7 June 1672 but was retaken the same day. Royal Katherine was also part of the Anglo-French fleet for the Battle of Schooneveld. She saw action in the War of the Grand Alliance, fighting at the Battle of Barfleur on 29 May 1692.  Rebuilds  Royal Katherine was rebuilt at Portsmouth in 1702 and became a 90-gun second rate. Battle of Malaga, 13 August 1704. Foudroyant in starboard-quarter view, is closely engaged to starboard with the Royal Katherine She served as the flagship of Admiral George Rooke in the War of the Spanish Succession from 1701. In 1706 she was renamed Ramillies in honour of John Churchill's victory at the Battle of Ramillies fought that year. Ramillies was rebuilt again at Portsmouth Dockyard between 30 November 1742 and 8 February 1743. She remained a 90-gun second rate in accordance with 1741 proposals of the 1719 Establishment, relaunching on 8 February. She saw service in the Seven Years' War and was the flagship of Admiral John Byng when he failed to relieve Port Mahon and so lost the island of Minorca to the French. Byng was later controversially executed for this action. Wreck Ramillies was wrecked at Bolt Tail near Hope Cove on 15 February 1760. The ship's master had mistaken their location as Ramillies approached the Devon shore, and the vessel was already within Hope Bay when the error was identified. There was a strong onshore wind and Ramillies captain ordered the anchors lowered to hold the vessel fast until it could turn back to open sea, but no purchase could be found on the sandy seabed and the ship continued to drift towards the coast.Rodger 1986, p. 46 After several hours she struck the cliffs beneath Bolt Tail and sank; twenty-six seamen and one midshipman survived from her crew of 850 men.Note in the Annual Register, 1775. p.187.

He was the first Superintendent of Locomotive Engines on the Great Western Railway from 1837 to 1864 and its chairman from 1865 to 1889. Early life Gooch was born in Bedlington, Northumberland, the son of John Gooch, an ironfounder, and his wife Anna Longridge. In 1831 his family moved to Tredegar Ironworks, Monmouthshire, South Wales, where his father had accepted a managerial post, and it was there that Daniel would begin training under Thomas Ellis senior, who together with Ironmaster Samuel Homfray and Richard Trevithick pioneered steam railway locomotion. Gooch wrote in his diaries \\"Large works of this kind are by far the best school for a young engineer to get a general knowledge of what he needs in after life.\\" and \\"...I look back upon the time spent at Tredegar as by far the most important years of my life...\\". He trained in engineering with a variety of companies, including a period with Robert Stephenson and Company, in Newcastle upon Tyne, as a draughtsman. At the age of 20 he was recruited by Isambard Kingdom Brunel for the Great Western Railway, under the title \\"Superintendent of Locomotive Engines\\", taking office on 18 August 1837. Whilst working in Newcastle he met his future wife, Margaret Tanner, the daughter of Henry Tanner, a Sunderland shipowner. He stayed in touch with Margaret when he moved south to work for Brunel. Railway engineer In Gooch's earliest days with the Great Western Railway, he struggled to keep the miscellaneous collection of broad gauge steam locomotives previously ordered by Brunel in working order. When working at Robert Stephenson and Company, he had helped design two gauge locomotives for the New Orleans Railway, which had never been delivered. Gooch persuaded Brunel to buy the two locomotives, North Star and Morning Star, and had Stephenson convert them to gauge before delivery. As the only reliable locomotives that the company had at that time, they were the basis of the GWR Star Class. He and Brunel improved the blastpipe arrangement of the North Star to improve its fuel efficiency. Eventually Gooch moved on from the Star class and designed the new GWR Firefly Class of 2-2-2 express passenger locomotives, introduced in 1840. In comparative trials by the Gauge Commissioners, Ixion of this class proved capable of speeds greater than its challenger. In 1843 Gooch introduced a new form of locomotive valve gear. In 1840, Gooch was responsible for identifying the site of Swindon Works and in 1846 for designing the first complete locomotive to be constructed there, Great Western, prototype of the GWR Iron Duke Class of 4-2-2 locomotives, which were able to achieve . Much renewed, they lasted to the end of the GWR broad gauge era. Though Gooch's locomotives were principally for the broad gauge, between 1854 and 1864 he also had to design a number of standard gauge classes for the GWR's new Northern Division. In 1864 he resigned from his post of Locomotive Superintendent, though he continued as a member of the GWR Board. Cable engineer and other roles From 1859 Gooch lived at Clewer Park in Windsor and was a Deputy Lieutenant for Berkshire. In 1865, he was recalled to the Great Western Railway Company as Chairman. He was also chief engineer of the Telegraph Construction & Maintenance Company. In this role, he was instrumental in laying the first successful transatlantic telegraph cable, using the SS Great Eastern (1865/66). Political career In 1865, while out of the country laying the cable, Gooch was elected Conservative MP for Cricklade. He held the seat until 1885. Later business activities In 1866 Gooch was created a baronet in recognition of his cable work. In 1868 he became chairman of the Telegraph Construction & Maintenance Company after John Pender, the first chairman, resigned. He led the Great Western Railway out of near-bankruptcy and took a particular interest in construction of the Severn Tunnel. Final abandonment of the broad gauge did not take place until after his death at the age of 73. Family Gooch married Margaret Tanner in 1838. Following her death in 1868, he married Emily Burder in 1870; she died in 1901. His brothers, John Viret Gooch, Thomas Longridge Gooch and William Frederick Gooch, were also railway engineers. Legacy GWR Castle Class steam loco no. 5070 and British Rail Western Region class 47 diesel loco no. D1663 (later 47078) were both named Sir Daniel Gooch. Continuing with this tradition, the present Great Western Railway company has named class 800 no. 800004 after Gooch; it runs on the line that Gooch helped to create.

He represented the district that included parts of the Boston neighborhoods of Dorchester, Mattapan and Hyde Park as well as parts of the town of Milton for 26 years. He resigned and accepted the position of President of the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council. He subsequently resigned in 2007 after pleading guilty to criminal obstruction of justice, in a court case about his testimony about his influence and participation in the redistricting process following the 2000 census. He was disbarred in 2010 (retroactive to January 23, 2007). From February 2007 to May 2012, he co-hosted a talk radio morning drive slot with WRKO.  Early life and family  Finneran's parents were William, a carpet cleaner, and his wife Mary (b. 1920). He is the fourth of seven children (five brothers and two sisters). He and his wife Donna (n√©e Kelley) have two daughters, Kelley and Shannon F. Mahoney of Milton, Massachusetts. He attended the Boston Latin School, graduated from Northeastern University in 1973 with a BA in business administration and finance, and received his JD from Boston College Law School.  Massachusetts House of Representatives  Finneran was first elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1978. He became the 83rd Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1996, when he defeated Democratic Majority Leader Richard Voke, the favorite to win, by obtaining all 35 votes of the Republican caucus as well as 56 of 121 Democratic votes (91 of 158 votes in total). As Speaker, he was known for his fiscal conservatism; he insisted on balanced budgets, and created that state's \\"rainy day fund.\\" He was also known for having somewhat more conservative positions on some social issues than most Massachusetts Democrats, and for his autocratic leadership style, which earned him the nickname \\"King Tom\\" from some detractors. In his 2001 redistricting proposal, some believed that he attempted to strike back against some of his critics by trying to eliminate their districts. For example, his initial proposal would have combined Newton's two main House districts and would have forced incumbent Representatives Kay Khan and Ruth Balser to run against each other. Both Khan and Balser were vocal opponents of Finneran, and it was only after the protests of many women's advocacy groups that Finneran relented.  Legislative redistricting and court case  After the 2000 U.S. census, in 2001 the Massachusetts House, under Finneran's leadership, drew up new House districts. The redistricting was challenged in Federal court, in a civil case, by the Black Political Task Force and others, as unfair to minority voters by constructing districts intended to favor white incumbents to the detriment of candidates preferred by blacks. In 2004, a three-judge Federal Court panel held that the redistricting plan violated section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by discriminating against black voters. It held that 17 Massachusetts House districts were enjoined from being used in the 2004 election, that the legislature was given six weeks to create an acceptable plan for the districts, and the plaintiff Black Political Task Force could comment on proposed districts before being approved by the Court.Black Political Task Force v. Galvin No. 02-11190 (D. Mass. Feb. 24, 2004) (Decision text) In a footnote to the decision, the court criticized Finneran, implying that he misled the court when he testified that he had little involvement in the redistricting process. The court said \\"Although Speaker Finneran denied any involvement in the redistricting process, the circumstantial evidence strongly suggests the opposite conclusion.\\" Finneran's attorney, Egbert, claimed that the statement was \\"simply wrong.\\" (Under state law and House rules, Finneran was free to participate in drafting the legislative map before it was released.)Issue: Redistricting / Finneran Probe: Background IssueSource (no date). Retrieved January 11, 2007. Federal prosecutors indicted Finneran in June 2005 in a criminal case, charging him with perjury and obstruction of justice for misrepresenting his participation in the redistricting process. The indictment cited eight meetings that he held about redistricting.  Obstruction of justice in legislative redistricting case  On January 5, 2007, prior to the start of the scheduled criminal trial Finneran pleaded guilty to one count of obstruction of justice in exchange for federal prosecutors' dropping perjury charges against him; the plea bargain allowed him to avoid jail time. Federal prosecutors and lawyers for Finneran recommended that the once-powerful figure on Beacon Hill receive 18 months of unsupervised probation and a $25,000 fine. In return, Finneran agreed not to run for any elected political position in state, federal or municipal government for five years after his sentencing date. The US Attorney's office agreed to dismiss three counts of perjury against Finneran. On November 14, 2003, he made misleading and false statements under oath in US District Court, according to the agreement. The seven-page document, signed by Finneran on January 3, 2007, states, \\"Defendant expressly and unequivocally admits that he committed the crime so charged in the indictment, and that he is in fact guilty of the offense so charged in the indictment.\\" Finneran faced 16 to 21 months in prison if he was convicted on all counts stemming from criminal charges that he misrepresented his role in the creation of a legislative redistricting map that diluted the clout of minority voters. Finneran lost his $30,000-a-year pension after his plea. A decision in 2006 by the state Supreme Judicial Court permitted a pension to be revoked in a similar case of breach of public trust. His attorney, Richard Egbert, has said Finneran never claimed he was totally uninvolved in the redistricting process and that he acknowledged in his testimony having about \\"half a dozen\\" conversations with leaders of the redistricting committee. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts Retirement Board voted in October 2012, that Finneran was not entitled to a government pension of about $32,900 a year due to his conviction of obstruction of justice in 2007. Finneran appealed the Retirement Board decision to the Boston Municipal Court where a judge reversed the Board's decision, concluding that Finneran's conviction did not bear \\"a direct factual link to his position as a House Member and/or Speaker[.]\\" On April 5, 2017, the Supreme Judicial Court reversed that decision and reinstated the decision of the Retirement Board, holding that \\"[s]imply put, it is only because he had been Speaker of the House at the relevant time that he was in a position to testify as to the genesis of the redistricting plan and to do so falsely. This connection is enough to warrant forfeiture\\" under the relevant Massachusetts statute, General Law c. 32, ¬ß 15(4). As the result of Finneran‚Äôs criminal convictions, he was also disbarred (license to practice law revoked) by the Massachusetts Board of Bar Overseers.  President of Massachusetts Biotechnology Council  Finneran served as president of the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council since he resigned from the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 2004 until January 8, 2007. The council is a non-profit organization with more than 500 corporate and academic members, promoting, and supporting the state's biotechnology industry. It has been observed that Finneran's value to the council has been primarily to be out of office, as Finneran was a vigorous and powerful opponent of stem cell research and repeatedly blocked legislative efforts to support stem cell research in Massachusetts. Finneran's reported salary was $416,000 a year.Report: Finneran Will Lose Job After Plea: Finneran Likely Out As Early As Monday The Boston Channel (WCVB - Channel 5), January 6, 2007. Retrieved January 7, 2007. On January 8, 2007, less than a week after the plea agreement, Finneran resigned from Biotechnology Council; the council unanimously accepted his resignation. Finneran had been praised as a highly effective lobbyist; his resignation permitted an internal debate about having a felon for the Council's president to end. Later life On March 9, 2009, by a vote of 11 to 1, the state Board of Bar Overseers recommended that former House Speaker and WRKO radio host Thomas M. Finneran be disbarred for his conviction on a federal charge of obstruction of justice. On January 11, 2010, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court revoked Finneran's license to practice law in the Commonwealth, rejecting an alternative penalty proposed by Finneran's lawyer of a two-year license suspension. His disbarment was retroactive to January 23, 2007 (the date on which he was suspended). On January 11, 2007, Finneran was announced as the morning drive-time host on the Boston WRKO radio station, replacing Scott Allen Miller. On Tuesday May 28, 2012 it was announced that Tom Finneran will end his radio career at Entercom Communications WRKO in Boston, effective Thursday May 31, 2012 (his last broadcast date). In a statement, Finneran said he was not able to keep up with the hours to host a well-informed show.Tom Finneran ends career at Entercom Communications Boston radio station WRKO, Boston Globe, May 29, 2012. On March 5, 2017, the state's highest court has ruled that former Speaker of the House Tom Finneran has to forfeit his pension, ending a years-long battle the former pol waged to keep his $33,000-a-year benefit. The Supreme Judicial Court overturned a district court order, ruling that Finneran's conviction for providing false testimony in a federal civil suit over the House's redistricting plan was directly linked to his job as speaker. That connection, the court decided, meant the State Retirement Board was right in stripping him of his annual pension. Finneran pleaded guilty in 2007 to one count of obstruction of justice. \\"Finneran's conduct falls squarely within ... requiring forfeiture where there is a direct factual link between the public employee's position and the offense,\\" the court wrote. \\"Finneran's false testimony concerning his knowledge of and participation in the redistricting planning process is in at least two respects directly linked as a factual matter to his position as Speaker of the House.\\" Finneran's pension is valued at about $470,000, according to court papers, including $240,000 the state would have owed him if the SJC upheld the district court order.

In 1874, 22-year-old Brown became editor of the Newark Advertiser in nearby Newark-on-Trent. Over the next 33 years, he wrote seven major books, including a two-volume History of Newark, which took him 15 years. He became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries and of the Royal Society of Literature. Journalistic career Engraving from 1886 book \\"True Stories of the Reign of Queen Victoria\\" by Cornelius Brown =Newark Advertiser= Within months of taking the editor's chair at the Newark Advertiser, Brown was ready to buy a half share in the newspaper, for which he paid Whiles ¬£600. The two partners agreed that until a working fund of ¬£300 had been created out of the profits neither would draw more than ¬£8 a month from the profits for his own use. Whiles was to manage the business side while Brown was in charge of editorial matters. The Advertiser was being printed in Nottingham for want of adequate facilities in Newark, but Brown found this a disadvantage and in 1880 the firm took premises at the corner of Appletongate and Magnus Street to house a Wharfedale printing press. The Newark Advertiser Co Ltd was incorporated on 19 September 1882. Cornelius Brown already had one book to his credit The Annals of Newark and in 1882 came The Worthies of Notts. Then Mr Brown laid his author's pen aside for three or four years to concentrate on the second important step in the Advertiser story. Six weeks later half a dozen men met at the Middlegate offices of solicitors Newton and Wallis (now Tallents Godfrey). They were the subscribers to the Memorandum of Association of the Newark Advertiser Co. Ltd. namely Brown, Major George Mark, Leycester Egerton, Captain William Henry Coape, Oates MP, William Newzam Nicholson, John Burton Barrow, and William Newton. They were all allocated shares, as were four more men who had made applications: Joseph Gilstrap Branston, William Evelyn, Denison, Viscount Newark (later MP for Newark) and Colonel James Thorpe. Barrow's interest in the firm was short-lived: he sold his four shares two-and-a-half years later. Branston did the same in the following year, but at that meeting in 1882 Major Egerton was made chairman and Brown was appointed secretary, manager and editor at a salary of ¬£200 a year. That salary remained unchanged for 21 years, at the end of which time Brown himself proposed that it should be cut to ¬£156, because he was handing over the responsibility of night work to a younger man. Under Brown's editorship the Advertiser continued to flourish. The board spent 50 shillings on a treat for the workforce to celebrate Queen Victoria's golden jubilee. Although it was decided to buy a new printing press, Brown later reported that he could alter the present one to make it do. He still travelled in daily from Southwell until in 1889 a house was built for him next to the works, by Brown and Son at a cost of ¬£490. =Technology= The Advertiser began to move into a technological age, buying a 2 hp gas engine to supplement the steam power, and in 1895 installing the telephone. Two years later came the first Linotype machine on hire. Within months came electric light, installed at a cost of ¬£100. Whiles, the original owner of the Advertiser, had maintained his connection with it as cashier and publisher, for the paper was still published from Stodman Street. When he died in 1900 he was succeeded by his son Herbert Whiles. In 1903, J. C. Kew came onto the Advertiser scene in a significant way. He had already been writing for the paper for some years, while running a coal business at Beaumond Cross. He was later to be chairman of Newark Rural District Council for 21 years and during that time served two years as Mayor of Newark. Handing over At the age of 51, Brown decided to hand over some of his editorial responsibilities to Kew, who was then 35. It was a prophetic decision, for just four years later Cornelius Brown died and Kew became editor. Brown had attended the October board meeting in 1907 but was taken ill ten days later after correcting the final proofs of his History of Newark. He died on 4 November without seeing the published version of Volume II. Private life Cornelius Brown married and set up home at Almar House, Westgate, Southwell. It was there that his first child was born in 1881. She was named Ethel and later became Mrs R. P. Blatherwick. Bibliography *Notes about Notts.

His documentation of the Victorian and Edwardian periods in Whitby, led him to be labelled as the \\"pictorial Boswell of Whitby.'''' Early life He was born in Headingley, Leeds, to the painter Thomas Sutcliffe and Sarah Lorentia Button. Frank was the eldest of eight children, and as a child, he slept in his father's studio. He had an elementary education at a dame school before moving into the new technology of photography. His father moved the family to Whitby in 1870 with the hope of commissions, but he died a year later when Francis was 18, leaving him as head of the family. Career \\"Stern Realities\\", a photograph Sutcliffe took circa 1890 in England. He made a living as a portrait photographer, working first in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, and then for the rest of his life in Whitby, living in Broomfield Terrace in Whitby before moving to Sleights, Yorkshire. His father had brought him into contact with prominent figures in the world of art such as John Ruskin, and he resented having to prostitute his art taking photographs of holiday-makers. His business in Skinner Street, a converted jet grinding and polishing works, rooted him to Whitby and the Eskdale valley but, by photographing the ordinary people that he knew well, he built up a most complete and revealing picture of a late Victorian town, and the people who lived and worked there. His most famous photograph was taken in 1886; Water Rats caused a little comment at the time as it featured naked children playing in a boat, but the image is not erotic. Sutcliffe was using the conventions of the academic nude to show how photography can approach art. He was, however, excommunicated by his local clergy for displaying it, as they thought it would 'corrupt' the opposite sex. Edward VII (then the Prince of Wales) later purchased a copy of the picture. He was a prolific writer on photographic subjects, contributed to several periodicals, and wrote a regular column in the Yorkshire Weekly Post. His work is in the collection of the Whitby Literary and Philosophical Society and in other national collections. Sutcliffe was a founder member of the Linked Ring Brotherhood (a society that existed to promote photography as an art form), and was made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society in 1941. Personal life He married Eliza Weatherill Duck, the daughter of a local bootmaker, on 1 January 1875 and had a son and three daughters at his home in Sleights. He died in Sleights, aged 87, on 31 May 1941 and was buried in Aislaby churchyard.

He succeeded in integrating the local public library and swimming pool in Monroe. At a time of high racial tension and official abuses, Williams promoted armed Black self-defense in the United States. In addition, he helped gain support for gubernatorial pardons in 1959 for two young African-American boys who had received lengthy reformatory sentences in what was known as the Kissing Case of 1958. It generated national and international attention and criticism of the state. Williams obtained a charter from the National Rifle Association and set up a rifle club to defend Black people in Monroe from Ku Klux Klan or other attackers. The local chapter of the NAACP supported Freedom Riders who traveled to Monroe in the summer of 1961 in a test of integrating interstate buses. In August 1961 he and his wife left the United States for several years to avoid kidnapping charges after a white couple got lost in the black part of town in Monroe. The local police and the FBI allegedly convinced the couple to say Williams had kidnapped them, and the FBI put out a warrant for his arrest, causing him to flee to Cuba, and, later, the People's Republic of China. These charges were dropped by the state when his trial opened in 1975 following his return, in 1970. Williams' book Negroes with Guns (1962) has been reprinted many times, most recently in 2013. It details his experience with violent racism and his disagreement with the non-violent wing of the Civil Rights Movement. The text was widely influential; Black Panther Party founder Huey Newton, and African American Defense League founder Mauricelm-Lei Millere cited it as a major inspiration. Early life =Youth= Robert Franklin Williams was born in Monroe, North Carolina on February 26, 1925 to Emma Carter and John L. Williams who worked as a railroad boiler washer.Robert Franklin Williams in North Carolina Birth Index, Family Search he is of yoruba ancestry Robert Franklin Williams in Michigan Obituaries, Family Search He had two sisters, Lorraine Garlington and Jessie Link; and two brothers, John H. Williams and Edward S. Williams. His grandmother, a former slave, he is of yoruba ancestry gave Williams his grandfather's rifle. His grandfather had been a Republican campaigner and publisher of the newspaper The People's Voice during the hard years after Reconstruction in North Carolina. At the age of 11, Williams witnessed the beating and dragging of a black woman by a police officer, Jesse Helms Sr.pp. 227-28. Helms Sr., later the Monroe chief of police, was the father of future United States Senator Jesse Helms.Jesse Helms: Timeline, PBSRobert and Mabel Williams Resource Guide, p. 36. As a young man Williams joined the Great Migration, traveling north for industrial work during World War II. He witnessed race riots in Detroit in 1943 prompted by labor competition between white and black Americans. Drafted in 1944, he served for a year and a half as a private in the then segregated Marines before returning home to Monroe.Robert F Williams's United States World War II Army Enlistment Records, Family Search =Marriage and family= In 1947, Williams married a 16-year- old African American woman named Mabel Ola Robinson, a fellow civil rights activist.[Mabel Ola Robinson in North Carolina Birth Index], Family SearchMabel Ola Robinson Williams memorial page, Family Search. Last updated May 13, 2014/ They had three children named John C. Williams, Robert F. Williams, Jr., and Franklin H. Williams. Civil rights movement =Early NAACP activities= After returning to Monroe in 1945 following his war service in the Marines, Williams joined the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He wanted to change the segregated town to protect the civil rights of blacks.Robert Franklin Williams, Sr. memorial page, Find A Grave.Robert and Mabel Williams Resource Guide, p. 9. The chapter had not been very active and was declining in numbers. Williams was elected president and Dr. Albert E. Perry as vice- president; the two generated new energy in the group during the 1950s. First they worked to integrate the public library. After that success, in 1957 Williams also led efforts to integrate the public swimming pools, which were funded and operated by taxpayer monies. He had followers form picket lines around the pool. The NAACP members organized peaceful demonstrations, but opponents fired on their lines. No one was arrested or punished, although law enforcement officers were present.\\"In Memory of Robert F Williams: A Voice for Armed Self-Defense and Black Liberation\\", Revolutionary Worker, November 17, 1996. At that time, Monroe had a large Ku Klux Klan chapter. The press estimated it had 7,500 members, when the city had a total of 12,000 residents. =Black Armed Guard= Alarmed at the threat to civil rights activists, Williams had applied to the National Rifle Association (NRA) for a charter for a local rifle club.Truman Nelson, 'People With Strength: The Story of Monroe, North Carolina', 1962, within 'Robert and Mabel Williams Resource Guide' (San Francisco: Freedom Archives, 2005), p. 55, 59. He called the Monroe Chapter of the NRA the Black Armed Guard; it was made up of about 50‚Äì60 men, including some veterans like him. They were determined to defend the local black community from racist attacks, a goal similar to that of the Deacons for Defense who established chapters in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama in 1964-1965.Nelson, People With Strength, p. 49, 60, 65. Newtown was the black residential area of Monroe. In the summer of 1957, there were rumors that the KKK was going to attack the house of Dr. Albert Perry, a practicing physician and vice-president of the Monroe NAACP. Williams and his men of the Armed Guard went to Perry's house to defend it, fortifying it with sandbags. When numerous KKK members appeared and shot from their cars, Williams and his followers returned the fire, driving them away.\\"In Memory of Robert F Williams\\", Revolutionary Worker, November 17, 1996; Timothy Tyson, \\"Robert Franklin Williams: A Warrior for Freedom;\\" Timothy Tyson, \\"Introduction\\" to Robert Williams Papers, p. vi. (See Sources) \\"After this clash the same city officials who said the Klan had a constitutional right to organize met in an emergency session and passed a city ordinance banning the Klan from Monroe without a special permit from the police chief.\\"Williams, Robert F. \\"1957: Swimming Pool Showdown\\", Southern Exposure, c. Summer 1980; the article appeared in a special issue devoted to the Ku Klux Klan, accessed November 17, 2013. In Negroes with Guns, Williams writes: > [R]acists consider themselves superior beings and are not willing to > exchange their superior lives for our inferior ones. They are most vicious > and violent when they can practice violence with impunity.\\"In Thomas > (Chapter 4), Spooks, Sex & Socio-Diagnostics, section: \\"Sadistic White > Insanity\\".

Williams insisted his position was defensive, as opposed to a declaration of war. He relied on numerous black military veterans from the local area, as well as financial support from across the country. In Harlem, particularly, fundraisers were frequently held and proceeds devoted to purchasing arms for Williams and his followers. He called it \\"armed self-reliance\\" in the face of white terrorism. Threats against Williams' life and his family became more frequent. =Kissing Case= In 1958 Williams as head of the NAACP chapter defended two young black boys, ages seven and nine, who were jailed in Monroe after a white girl kissed one of them.Robert and Mabel Williams Resource Guide , p. 12. The incident was covered internationally and Williams became known around the world. His publicity campaign, inviting a barrage of headlines castigating Monroe and the US in the global press, was instrumental in shaming the officials involved.Nelson, People With Strength: The Story of Monroe, North Carolina, p. 62-63 Authorities eventually released the boys, who were pardoned by the governor of North Carolina, but the state never apologized for its treatment of them. The controversy was known as the \\"Kissing Case.\\" =Harassment and difficulties= On May 12, 1958, the Raleigh Eagle, a North Carolina newspaper, reported that Nationwide Insurance Company was canceling Williams' collision and comprehensive coverage, effective that day. They first canceled all of his automobile insurance, but decided to reinstate his liability and medical payments coverage, enough for Williams to retain his car license. The company said that Williams' affiliation with the NAACP was not a factor; they noted \\"that rocks had been thrown at his car and home several times by people driving by his home at night. These incidents just forced us to get off the comprehensive and collision portions of his policy.\\" The Raleigh Eagle reported that Williams had said that six months before, a 50-car Ku Klux Klan caravan had swapped gunfire with a group of blacks outside the home of Dr. A. E. Perry, vice president of the local NAACP chapter. The article quoted police chief A. A. Maurey as denying part of that story. He said, \\"I know there was no shooting.\\" He said that he had had several police cars accompanying the KKK caravan to watch for possible law violations. The article quoted Williams: \\"These things have happened,\\" Williams insisted. \\"Police try to make it appear that I have been exaggerating and trying to stir up trouble. If police tell me I am in no danger and that they can't confirm these events, why then has my insurance been cancelled?\\"Insurance cancelled, Raleigh Eagle, May 12, 1958, p. 15. The following year, Williams was so incensed with the decision of a Monroe court to acquit two white men of raping a black woman, Mary Reid, that he replied by saying on the courthouse steps: > \\"We cannot rely on the law. We can get no justice under the present system. > If we feel that injustice is done, we must then be prepared to inflict > justice on these people. Since the federal government will not bring a halt > to lynching, and since the so-called courts lynch our people legally, if > it's necessary to stop lynching with lynching, then we must be willing to > resort to that method.

He must convict > his attackers on the spot. He must meet violence with violence, lynching > with lynching.\\" It is not known where these quotes originated. =Suspension from the NAACP= This statement led to William's suspension from the NAACP which said that he made \\"violent\\" statements, accompanied by distortions in the mainstream media, like The New York Times, and by Martin Luther King Jr., among other nonviolent activists, about what he said despite the fact that he disavowed any reference to lynching, rejecting retaliatory force, also called retaliatory violence, and only said that African Americans should act in armed self-defense if attacked by white people.Timothy B.

Williams gained massive opposition within not only white communities, but also black communities after advocating \\"meeting violence with violence.\\"https://biography.jrank.org/pages/2576/Forman-James-Dedicated-Life- Fighting-Oppression.html#ixzz6ZMixHXoB =Freedom Rides and prosecution= The FBI's wanted poster alerted people to an armed kidnapper. Despite losing much support, civil rights activist James Forman was still supportive of Williams and his advocacy for using armed self defense against white oppression. Forman, who would also promote Williams' armed self-defense message during a visit to his home in Monroe, North Carolina, also agreed to assist Williams in organizing a Freedom Ride in Monroe. When CORE dispatched \\"Freedom Riders\\" to Monroe to campaign in 1961 for integrated interstate bus travel, the local NAACP chapter served as their base. They were housed in Newtown, the black section of Monroe. Pickets marched daily at the courthouse, put under a variety of restraints by the Monroe police, such as having to stand 15 feet apart. During this campaign, Freedom Riders were beaten by violent crowds in Anniston, Alabama and Birmingham. Around this time, a white couple from a nearby town drove into the black section of Monroe when other streets were closed by mobs because of protests at the county courthouse. They were stopped in the street by an angry crowd. For their safety, they were taken to Williams' home.Tyson, \\"Introduction\\" to Williams Papers, p. xiv. For another account, see the Introduction to Robert F. Williams, Listen Brother! Both works are listed in Sources section of this article.Truman Nelson, People With Strength: The Story of Monroe, North Carolina, p. 70-77. Williams initially told them that they were free to go, but he soon realized that the crowd would not grant safe passage. He kept the white couple in a house nearby until they were able to safely leave the neighborhood. North Carolina law enforcement accused Williams of having kidnapped the couple. He and his family fled the state with local law enforcement in pursuit. On August 28, 1961, the FBI issued a warrant in Charlotte, North Carolina, charging Williams with unlawful interstate flight to avoid prosecution for kidnapping. The FBI document lists Williams as a \\"freelance writer and janitor ... [Williams] ... has previously been diagnosed as a schizophrenic and has advocated and threatened violence ... considered armed and extremely dangerous.\\" After a wanted poster, signed by the director J. Edgar Hoover, was distributed, Williams decided to leave the country.Robert and Mabel Williams Resource Guide, p. 19. Exile and return =Cuba= Williams went to Cuba in 1961 by way of Canada and Mexico. He regularly broadcast addresses from Cuba to Southern blacks on \\"Radio Free Dixie\\". He established the station with approval of Cuban leader Fidel Castro, along with assistance of the Cuban citizens, and operated it from 1962 to 1965.Robert and Mabel Williams Resource Guide, pp. 20-21. During the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, Williams used Radio Free Dixie to urge black soldiers in the U.S. armed forces, who were then preparing for a possible invasion of Cuba, to engage in insurrection against the United States. > While you are armed, remember this is your only chance to be free. ... This > is your only chance to stop your people from being treated worse than dogs. > We'll take care of the front, Joe, but from the back, he'll never know what > hit him. You dig?Michael Dobbs, One Minute to Midnight: Kennedy, Khrushchev > and Castro on the Brink of Nuclear War, Knopf (2008). During this stay, Mabel and Robert Williams published a newspaper, The Crusader. He wrote his book Negroes With Guns while in Cuba. It had a significant influence on Huey P. Newton, founder of the Black Panthers and in later years Mauricelm-Lei Millere, the founder of African American Defense League. Despite his absence from the United States, in 1964 Williams was elected president of the US-based Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM).\\"Exile Robert Williams' Wife Returns to US from Africa\\", The Afro American (Baltimore, Maryland), August 30 or September 6, 1969 (unclear). Visit to Hanoi In 1965 Williams traveled to Hanoi, then the capital of North Vietnam. In a public speech, he advocated armed violence against the United States during the Vietnam War, congratulated China on obtaining its own nuclear weapons (which Williams referred to as \\"The Freedom Bomb\\"), and showed his solidarity with the North Vietnamese against the United States military attacks against that country.Williams, Robert F., \\"Speech Delivered at the International Conference for Solidarity with the People of Vietnam Against U.S. Imperialist Aggression for the Defense of Peace. Hanoi, Democratic Republic of Vietnam November 25‚Äì29, 1965\\" (March 1965). The Crusader 6(3), pp. 1-5. Some Communist Party USA members opposed Williams' positions, suggesting they would divide the working class in the U.S. along racial lines. In a May 18, 1964, letter from Havana to his U.S. lawyer, civil rights attorney Conrad Lynn, Williams wrote: =China= In 1965, Williams and his wife left Cuba to settle in China, where he was well received. They lived comfortably there and he associated with higher functionaries of the Chinese government. In January 1968, Conrad Lynn wrote to encourage Williams to return to the U.S., to which Williams responded: Disillusionment Lynn wrote Williams in a letter on January 24, 1968: \\"You are wise in not making a decision to come back until the financial situation is assured.\\" Because no financial backing could be found, no 1968 \\"Williams for President\\" campaign was ever launched by Williams' supporters in the United States. By November 1969, Williams apparently had become disillusioned with the U.S. left. As his lawyer, Conrad Lynn, noted in a November 7, 1969 letter to W. Haywood Burns of the Legal Defense Foundation: > Williams now clearly takes the position that he has been deserted by the > left. How and whether he fits black militant organizations into that > category I don't know. Radio Free Europe offered him pay to broadcast for > them. So far he has refused. But he has not foreclosed making a deal with > the government or the far right. He takes the position that he is entitled > to make any maneuver to keep from going to jail for kidnapping ...Conrad > Lynn to Haywood Burns, November 7, 1969, Conrad Lynn Papers, Howard Gotlieb > Archival Research Center, Boston University. Williams was suspected by the Justice Department of wanting to fill the vacuum of influence left after the assassinations of his friends Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. Hoover received reports that blacks looked to Williams as a figure similar to John Brown, the militant abolitionist who attacked a federal facility at Harper's Ferry before the American Civil War. Williams' attempts to contact the U.S. government in order to return were consistently rebuffed. =Return= His wife Mabel Williams returned first, entering the United States in September 1969.\\"Exile Robert Williams' Wife Returns to US from Africa\\", The Afro American (Baltimore, Maryland), August 30 or September 6, 1969; p. 22, accessed November 17, 2013. Williams returned via London, England, reaching Detroit, Michigan in 1969. He was immediately arrested for extradition to North Carolina for trial on the kidnapping charge. Williams was tried in Monroe, North Carolina, in December 1975. The historian Gwendolyn Midlo Hall chaired his defense committee and a broad range of leftists arrived to support him. Noted attorney William Kunstler represented Williams in court. The State of North Carolina dropped all charges against him almost immediately.\\"Charges Dropped Against Williams\\", Wilmington Morning Star (UPI). January 17, 1976, p. 2. Gwendolyn Midlo Hall Papers (1939-1991), Bentley Historical Library, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan. Death Williams died at age 71 from Hodgkin's lymphoma on October 15, 1996. He had been living in Baldwin, Michigan. At his funeral, Rosa Parks, an activist known for sparking the bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1955, recounted the high regard for Williams by those who joined with Martin Luther King Jr. in the peaceful marches in Alabama.Timothy B.

Glisson (ed.), The Human Tradition in the Civil Rights Movement, Rowan & Littlefield, 2006, pp. 227‚Äì54; accessed May 12, 2011. Parks gave the eulogy at Williams' funeral in 1996, praising him for \\"his courage and for his commitment to freedom\\". She concluded, \\"The sacrifices he made, and what he did, should go down in history and never be forgotten.\\"Timothy B.

Thiruvaiyaru is situated on the banks of the river Kaveri, 11 km from North of Thanjavur. National Highway No.136 from Thanjavur connect Thiruvaiyaru, Ariyalur, Perambalur byepass and Aththur byepass. State roads to Kumbakonam at 37 km in the East and Kallanai 33 km in the West connect Thiruvaiyaru. Thiruvaiyaru has an old Siva temple dedicated to Aiyarappar or Panchanatheeswar. Though pilgrims flock to this temple throughout the year, Thiruvaiyaru is more renowned for its association with Saint Thyagaraja, who, along with Muthuswami Dikshitar and Shyama Sastri, comprised the Trinity of Carnatic music. Thiruvaiyaru means Five Rivers around the city. The Five Rivers are Vadavaar, Vennaar, Vettaar, Kudamurutti and Kaveri. Thiruvaiyaru is the headquarters of the Thiruvaiyaru taluk. Thiruvaiyaru is a small, quiet town. But due to the National Highway and State Highways going across the center of the town, frequent traffic jams happening for a long time. However, its modesty belies in its importance as a pilgrim Centre. On the highway from Thanjavur, you pass five bridges over the Vadavar, Vettar, Vennar, Kudamurutti and Kaveri, the five rivers from which Thiruvaiyaru gets its name (thiru = sacred; ai(ndhu) = five; aaru = river). The presiding deities of the Shiva temple here, God Panchanadeeshvara and Goddess Dharmasamvardhani in Sanskrit (in Tamil, Ayyarappar and Aram valarththa nayagi) both mean the same thing,\`Panchanadeeswara got his name as the Lord of these Five Rivers. Thiruvaiyaru is considered as holy as Varanasi and bathing in the Kaveri here is as guaranteed to rid devotees of sins as bathing in the Ganges. Near the Shiva temple is the one-roomed house where Thyagaraja composed some of his greatest works. Thyagaraja was interred on the banks of the river Kaveri and it is called the revered Samadhi (burial place) of the saint composer and it is here that the greatest music festival in the country takes place annually. Nearby are the Samadhis (burial places) of some of the other saints like Shiva Prakasha Swamigal and Bangalore Nagaratnamma, who actually identified and rebuilt the Samadhi of Sri Tyagaraja. The Thyagaraja Aradhana festival is held in the Bahula Panchami Thithi of Margazhi (Margashirsha)Tamil month which falls on December or January when most of the leading exponents of Carnatic music come to perform and are watched by thousands of ardent fans of classical music. A huge complex is built at this site to accommodate the large audience that come to the concert in ever increasing numbers every year. History The vast temple in this town, known as \\"Dakshina Kailasam\\" (Southern abode of Siva), built in an area of approximately 60,000 square meters, has five prakaram (outer precincts used for religious purposes) and many 'mandapams' (great halls). Several inscriptions in the temple affiliates the temple to the Cholas, Pandyas, and other rulers. Karikala Chola, Rajaraja the Great, Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan, and Krishna Devarayar are associated with Thiruvaiyaru. The temple has two distinct divisions called 'Uttarakailasam' and 'Dakshinakailasam'. Uttarakailasam was built by Rajaraja Chola's chief queen Dantisaktivitanki alias Lokamahadevi in the late 10th century who also made several endowments. It was called Lokamahadevi Isvaram Udaiyar Mahadevar after the queen herself. She endowed several musical instruments during the time of Rajaraja while his daughter Gangamahadevi alias Arumoli Chandramalli gifted several fly-whisks to the presiding deity. Dakshina kailasam was renovated by Rajendra Cholan's queen. The Tevaram trinity (Appar, Sambandar, and Sundarar) have composed more than 100 songs on the presiding deity of this temple town. The town is called as \\"Ai-aaru\\" (‡Æê‡ÆØ‡Ææ‡Æ±‡ØÅ), meaning five rivers, by them.Tiruvaiyaru Panchanadeeswarar -Aiyaarappar Temple - Sivasthalam The Tiruvaiyaru temple has also a shrine for Aatkondar or Kala Samharamoorthy, which is unique in the world. A Homa Kund started by saint Shri Adi Sankara can be found outside the shrine of Aatkondar. In the Kund a sort of incense- like called \\"Kungaliyum\\" powder is dropped in it. It is believed this wards of scorpion stings or some such bites and also gives longevity of life. The Kungaliyum is available from vendors around there hand-packed in loose papers. Thiruvaiyaru is greatly praised by \\"Kalki Krishnamurthy\\" in his novel \\"Ponniyin Selvan\\". This temple is among the six temples in Kaveri river bank which are equivalent to Kasi.

He was sentenced to death for his part in an attack upon a British Army supply lorry which resulted in the deaths of three British soldiers. His execution inflamed nationalist public opinion in Ireland, largely because of his age. The timing of the execution, only days after the death by hunger strike of Terence MacSwiney, the republican Lord Mayor of Cork, brought public opinion to a fever-pitch. His death attracted international attention, and attempts were made by U.S. and Vatican officials to secure a reprieve. His execution and MacSwiney's death precipitated an escalation in violence as the Irish War of Independence entered its bloodiest phase, and Barry became an Irish republican martyr. Early life Kevin Barry was born on 20 January 1902, at 8 Fleet Street, Dublin, to Thomas and Mary (n√©e Dowling) Barry. The fourth of seven children, two boys and five sisters, Kevin was baptised in St Andrew's Church, Westland Row. Thomas Barry Sr. worked on the family's farm at Tombeagh, Hacketstown, County Carlow, and ran a dairy business from Fleet Street. Thomas Barry Sr. died in 1908, aged 56.Cronin, Sean.

His mother came from Drumguin, County Carlow, and, upon the death of her husband, moved the family to nearby Tombeagh. As a child he went to the national school in Rathvilly. On returning to Dublin, he attended St Mary's College, Rathmines, until the school closed in the summer of 1916. When he was thirteen, he attended a commemoration for the Manchester Martyrs, who were hanged in England in 1867. Afterwards he wished to join Constance Markievicz's Fianna √âireann, but was reportedly dissuaded by his family. Belvedere College From St Mary's College he transferred to Belvedere College, where he was a member of the championship Junior Rugby Cup team, and earned a place on the senior team. In 1918 he became secretary of the school hurling club which had just been formed, and was one of their most enthusiastic players. Belvedere College, the Jesuit college attended by Kevin Barry. To mark the anniversary of his execution, Belvedere's museum mounted a special exhibition of Kevin Barry memorabilia. A Jesuit priest, Thomas Counihan, who was Barry's science and mathematics teacher, said of him: \\"He was a dour kind of lad. But once he got down to something he went straight ahead‚Ä¶ There was no waving of flags with him, but he was sincere and intense.\\" Notwithstanding his many activities, he did not neglect his studies. He won a merit-based scholarship given annually by Dublin Corporation, which allowed him to become a student of medicine at UCD. Medical student He entered University College Dublin in 1919. His closest friend at college was Gerry MacAleer, from Dungannon, whom he had first met in Belvedere. Other friends included Frank Flood, Tom Kissane and Mick Robinson, who, unknown to many in the college, were, along with Barry, members of the Irish Volunteers. Volunteer activities In October 1917, during his second year at Belvedere, aged 15, he joined the IRA. Assigned originally to ‚ÄòC‚Äô Company 1st Battalion, based on the north side of Dublin, he later transferred to the newly formed ‚ÄòH‚Äô Company, under the command of Capt. Seamus Kavanagh. His first job as a member of the IRA was delivering mobilisation orders around the city. Along with other volunteers, Barry trained in a number of locations in Dublin, including the building at 44 Parnell Square, the present day headquarters of Sinn F√©in, now named Kevin Barry Hall. The IRA held Field exercises during this period which were conducted in north county Dublin and in areas such as Finglas. Wall plaque marking the site in 1919, where the Active Service Unit of the Dublin Brigade of the Irish Republican Army was founded. The building is in Great Denmark Street, Dublin. The following year, at the age of 16, he was introduced by Se√°n O'Neill and Bob O'Flanagan to the Clarke Luby Club of the IRB, which had been reorganised. He took part in a number of IRA operations in the years leading up to his capture. He was part of the unit which raided the Shamrock Works for weapons destined to be handed over to the R.I.C. He also took part in the raid on Mark's of Capel Street, looking for ammunition and explosives. On 1 June 1920, under Vice-Commandant Peadar Clancy, he played a notable part in the seizing of the King's Inn, capturing the garrison‚Äôs arms. The haul included 25 rifles, two light machine guns and large quantities of ammunition. The 25 British soldiers captured during the attack were released as the volunteers withdrew. In recognition of his dedication to duty he was promoted to Section Commander. Ambush On the morning of 20 September 1920, Barry went to Mass, then joined a party of IRA volunteers on Bolton Street in Dublin. Their orders were to ambush a British army lorry as it picked up a delivery of bread from the bakery, and capture their weapons. The ambush was scheduled for 11:00am, which gave him enough time to take part in the operation and return to class in time for an examination he had at 2:00pm. The truck arrived late, and was under the command of Sergeant Banks. Armed with a .38 Mauser Parabellum, Barry and members of C Company were to surround the lorry, disarm the soldiers, take the weapons and escape. He covered the back of the vehicle and, when challenged, the five soldiers complied with the order to lay down their weapons. A shot was then fired; Terry Golway, author of For the Cause of Liberty, suggests it was possibly a warning shot from an uncovered soldier in the front. Barry and the rest of the ambush party then opened fire. His gun jammed twice and he dived for cover under the vehicle. His comrades fled and he was left behind. He was then spotted and arrested by the soldiers. One of the soldiers, Private Harold Washington, aged 15, had been shot dead. Two others, Privates Marshall Whitehead and Thomas Humphries, were both badly wounded and later died of their wounds. The British Army released the following statement on Monday afternoon: > This morning a party of one N.C.O. and six men of the Duke of Wellington's > Regiment were fired on by a body of civilians outside a bakery in Church > Street, Dublin. One soldier was killed and four were wounded. A piquet of > the Lancashire Fusiliers in the vicinity, hearing the shots, hurried to > their comrades' assistance, and succeeded in arresting one of the > aggressors. No arms or equipment were lost by the soldiers. Much was made of Barry's age by Irish newspapers, but the British military pointed out that the three soldiers who had been killed were \\"much the same age as Barry\\". On 20 October, Major Reginald Ingram Marians OBE, Head of the Press Section of the General Staff, informed Basil Clarke, Head of Publicity, that Washington was \\"only 19 and that the other soldiers were of similar ages.\\" General Macready Murphy, Father Brian P. (OSB), The Origins & Organisation of British Propaganda in Ireland 1920, Aubane Historical Society, 2006; was well aware of the \\"propaganda value of the soldier's ages.\\" Macready informed General Sir Henry Wilson on the day that sentence was pronounced \\"of the three men who were killed by him (Barry) and his friends two were 19 and one 20 ‚Äî official age so probably they were younger... so if you want propaganda there you are.\\"\\"Kevin Barry: Hijacking the patriot's legacy\\", BBC News, 12 October 2001. It was later confirmed that Private Harold Washington was 15 years and 351 days old, having been born 4 October 1904.Kevin Barry: Hijacking the patriot's legacy, BBC News, 12 October 2001 About this competing propaganda, Martin Doherty wrote in a magazine article entitled 'Kevin Barry & the Anglo-Irish Propaganda War': > from the British point of view, therefore, the Anglo-Irish propaganda war > was probably unwinable [sic]. Nationalist Ireland had decided that men like > Kevin Barry fought to free their country, while British soldiers ‚Äî young or > not ‚Äî sought to withhold that freedom.

Capture and torture Sinn F√©in's Dublin HQ at the Kevin Barry Memorial Hall Barry was placed in the back of the lorry with the young body of Private Harold Washington, and was subjected to some abuse by Washington's comrades. He was transported then to the North Dublin Union. Upon arrival at the barracks he was taken under military police escort to the defaulters' room where he was searched and handcuffed. A short while later, three sergeants of the Lancashire Fusiliers and two officers began the interrogation. He gave his name and an address of 58 South Circular Road, Dublin (his uncle's address), and his occupation as a medical student, but refused to answer any other questions. The officers continued to demand the names of other republicans involved in the ambush. At this time a publicity campaign was mounted by Sinn F√©in. Barry received orders on 28 October from his brigade commander, Richard McKee, \\"to make a sworn affidavit concerning his torture in the North Dublin Union.\\" Arrangements were made to deliver this through Barry's sister, Kathy, to Desmond Fitzgerald, director of publicity for Sinn F√©in, \\"with the object of having it published in the World press, and particularly in the English papers, on Saturday 30th October.\\"\\"Kevin Barry, the Incident at Monk's bakery and the Making of an Irish Republican Legend\\" by John Ainsworth (excerpt), History, Vol 87, No 287, July 2002 (pp 380-84). The affidavit, drawn up in Mountjoy Prison days before his execution, describes his treatment when the question of names was repeated: > He tried to persuade me to give the names, and I persisted in refusing. He > then sent the sergeant out of the room for a bayonet. When it was brought in > the sergeant was ordered by the same officer to point the bayonet at my > stomach ... The sergeant then said that he would run the bayonet into me if > I did not tell ... The same officer then said to me that if I persisted in > my attitude he would turn me out to the men in the barrack square, and he > supposed I knew what that meant with the men in their present temper. I said > nothing. He ordered the sergeants to put me face down on the floor and twist > my arm ... When I lay on the floor, one of the sergeants knelt on my back, > the other two placed one foot each on my back and left shoulder, and the man > who knelt on me twisted my right arm, holding it by the wrist with one hand, > while he held my hair with the other to pull back my head. The arm was > twisted from the elbow joint. This continued, to the best of my judgment, > for five minutes. It was very painful ... I still persisted in refusing to > answer these questions... A civilian came in and repeated the questions, > with the same result. He informed me that if I gave all the information I > knew I could get off.This affidavit was written by Se√°n √ì hUadhaigh, > solicitor; witnessed by Myles Keogh, Justice of the Peace and signed by > Kevin Barry. The original is now in the National Museum. On 28 October, the Irish Bulletin (organised by Dick McKee, the IRA Commandant of the Dublin Brigade), a news-sheet produced by D√°il √âireann's Department of Publicity,Townshend, Charles. The British Campaign in Ireland 1919-1921 The Development of Political and Military Policies (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1975), p. 67. published Barry's statement alleging torture. The headline read: English Military Government Torture a Prisoner of War and are about to Hang him. The Irish Bulletin declared Barry to be a prisoner of war, suggesting a conflict of principles was at the heart of the conflict. The English did not recognise a war and treated all killings by the IRA as murder. Irish republicans claimed that they were at war and it was being fought between two opposing nations and therefore demanded prisoner of war status. Historian John Ainsworth, author of Kevin Barry, the Incident at Monk's bakery and the Making of an Irish Republican Legend, pointed out that Barry had been captured by the British not as a uniformed soldier but disguised as a civilian and in possession of flat-nosed \\"Dum-dum\\" bullets, which expand upon impact, maximising the amount of damage done to the \\"unfortunate individual\\" targeted, in contravention of the Hague Convention of 1899. Erskine Childers addressed the question of political status in a letter to the press on 29 October, which was published the day after Barry's execution. ::This lad Barry was doing precisely what Englishmen would be doing under the same circumstances and with the same bitter and intolerable provocation ‚Äî the suppression by military force of their country's liberty. ::To hang him for murder is an insulting outrage, and it is more: it is an abuse of power: an unworthy act of vengeance. contrasting ill with the forbearance and humanity invariably shown by the Irish Volunteers towards the prisoners captured by them when they have been successful in encounters similar to this one. These guerrilla combats with soldiers and constables ‚Äî both classes do the same work with the same weapons; the work of military repression ‚Äî are typical episodes in Ireland. ::Murder of individual constables, miscalled ‚Äòpolice‚Äô, have been comparatively rare. The Government figure is 38, and it will not, to my knowledge, bear examination. I charge against the British Government 80 murders by soldiers and constables: murders of unarmed people, and for the most part wholly innocent people, including old men, women and boys. ::To hang Barry is to push to its logical extreme the hypocritical pretense that the national movement in Ireland unflinchingly supported by the great mass of the Irish people, is the squalid conspiracy of a ‚Äòmurder gang‚Äô. ::That is false; it is a natural uprising: a collision between two Governments, one resting on consent, the other on force. The Irish are struggling against overwhelming odds to defend their own elected institutions against extinction. In a letter addressed to \\"the civilised nations of the world\\", Arthur Griffith ‚Äî then acting President of the Republic wrote: > Under similar circumstances a body of Irish Volunteers captured on June 1 of > the present year a party of 25 English military who were on duty at the > King's Inns, Dublin. Having disarmed the party the Volunteers immediately > released their prisoners. This was in strict accordance with the conduct of > the Volunteers in all such encounters. Hundreds of members of the armed > forces have been from time to time captured by the Volunteers and in no case > was any prisoner maltreated even though Volunteers had been killed and > wounded in the fighting, as in the case of Cloyne, Co. Cork, when, after a > conflict in which one Volunteer was killed and two wounded, the whole of the > opposing forces were captured, disarmed, and set at liberty. Ainsworth notes that \\"Griffith was deliberately using examples relating to IRA engagements with British military forces rather than the police, for he knew that engagements involving the police in particular were usually of an uncivilized nature, characterized by violence and brutality, albeit on both sides by this stage.\\" Trial The War Office ordered that Kevin Barry be tried by court-martial under the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act, which received Royal Assent on 9 August 1920. General Sir Nevil Macready, Commander- in-Chief of British forces in Ireland then nominated a court of nine officers under a Brigadier-General Onslow. Kevin Barry Commemorative Plaque close to the spot where he was captured on Church Street, Dublin On 20 October, at 10 o‚Äôclock, the nine officers of the court ‚Äî ranging in rank from Brigadier to Lieutenant ‚Äî took their places at an elevated table. At 10.25,He was 25 minutes late for his trial because the armoured car bringing him from Mountjoy Prison to Marlborough Barracks broke down on the North Circular Road. Kevin Barry was brought into the room by a military escort. Then Se√°n √ì hUadhaigh sought a short adjournment to consult his client. The court granted this request. After the short adjournment Barry announced \\"As a soldier of the Irish Republic, I refuse to recognise the court.\\" Brigadier Onslow explained the prisoner's \\"perilous situation\\" and that he was being tried on a capital charge. He did not reply. √ì hUadhaigh then rose to tell the court that since his client did not recognise the authority of the court he himself could take no further part in the proceedings. Barry was charged on three counts of the murder of Private Marshall Whitehead. One of the bullets taken from Whitehead's body was of .45 calibre, while all witnesses stated that Barry was armed with a .38 Mauser Parabellum. The Judge Advocate General informed the court that the Crown had only to prove that the accused was one of the party that killed three British soldiers, and every member of the party was technically guilty of murder. In accordance with military procedure the verdict was not announced in court. He was returned to Mountjoy, and at about 8 o‚Äôclock that night, the district court-martial officer entered his cell and read out the sentence: death by hanging. The public learned on 28 October that the date of execution had been fixed for 1 November. Execution Barry spent the last day of his life preparing for death. His ordeal focused world attention on Ireland. According to Sean Cronin, author of a biography of Barry (Kevin Barry), he hoped for a firing squad rather than the gallows, as he had been condemned by a military court. A friend who visited him in Mountjoy prison after he received confirmation of the death sentence, said: > He is meeting death as he met life with courage but with nothing of the > braggart. He does not believe that he is doing anything wonderfully heroic. > Again and again he has begged that no fuss be made about him. He reported Barry as saying \\"It is nothing, to give one's life for Ireland. I'm not the first and maybe I won't be the last. What's my life compared with the cause?\\" Barry joked about his death with his sister Kathy. \\"Well, they are not going to let me like a soldier fall‚Ä¶ But I must say they are going to hang me like a gentleman.\\" This was, according to Cronin, a reference to George Bernard Shaw's The Devil's Disciple, the last play Kevin and his sister had seen together. On 31 October, he was allowed three visits of three people each, the last of which was taken by his mother, brother and sisters. In addition to the two Auxiliaries with him, there were five or six warders in the boardroom. As his family were leaving, they met Canon John Waters, on the way in, who said, \\"This boy does not seem to realise he is going to die in the morning.\\" Mrs Barry asked him what he meant. He said: \\"He is so gay and light- hearted all the time. If he fully realised it, he would be overwhelmed.\\" Mrs Barry replied, \\"Canon Waters, I know you are not a Republican. But is it impossible for you to understand that my son is actually proud to die for the Republic?\\" Canon Waters became somewhat flustered as they parted. The Barry family recorded that they were upset by this encounter because they considered the chief chaplain \\"the nearest thing to a friend that Kevin would see before his death, and he seemed so alien.\\" Plaque placed by the Irish Government on the graves of the Volunteers Kevin Barry was hanged on 1 November, after hearing two Masses in his cell. Canon Waters, who walked with him to the scaffold, wrote to Barry's mother later, \\"You are the mother, my dear Mrs Barry, of one of the bravest and best boys I have ever known. His death was one of the most holy, and your dear boy is waiting for you now, beyond the reach of sorrow or trial.\\" Dublin Corporation met on the Monday, and passed a vote of sympathy with the Barry family, and adjourned the meeting as a mark of respect. The Chief Secretary's office in Dublin Castle, on the Monday night, released the following communiqu√©: > The sentence of death by hanging passed by court-martial upon Kevin Barry, > or Berry, medical student, aged 18¬Ω years, for the murder of Private > Whitehead in Dublin on September 20, was duly executed this morning at > Mountjoy Prison, Dublin. > At a military court of inquiry, held subsequently in lieu of an inquest, > medical evidence was given to the effect that death was instantaneous. The > court found that the sentence had been carried out in accordance with law. Barry's body was buried at 1.30 p.m, in a plot near the women's prison. His comrade and fellow-student Frank Flood was buried alongside him four months later. A plain cross marked their graves and those of Patrick Moran, Thomas Whelan, Thomas Traynor, Patrick Doyle, Thomas Bryan, Bernard Ryan, Edmond Foley and Patrick Maher who were hanged in the same prison before the Anglo- Irish Treaty of July 1921 which ended hostilities between Irish republicans and the British. The men had been buried in unconsecrated ground on the jail property and their graves went unidentified until 1934.They became known as The Forgotten Ten by republicans campaigning for the bodies to be reburied with honour and proper rites.An Phoblacht/Republican News On 14 October 2001, the remains of these ten men were given a state funeral and moved from Mountjoy Prison to be re-interred at Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin.Department of the Taoiseach - Reinterment of 10 volunteers executed during War of Independence Aftermath Rathvilly, County Carlow On 14 October 2001 the remains of Kevin Barry and nine other volunteers from the War of Independence were given a state funeral and moved from Mountjoy Prison to be re-interred at Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin. Barry's grave is the first on the left. The only full-length biography of Kevin Barry was written by his nephew, journalist Donal O'Donovan, published in 1989 as Kevin Barry and his Time. In 1965, Sean Cronin wrote a short biography, simply entitled \\"Kevin Barry\\"; this was published by The National Publications Committee, Cork, to which Tom Barry provided a foreword. Barry is remembered in a well-known song about his imprisonment and execution, written shortly after his death and still sung today. The tune to \\"Kevin Barry\\" was taken from the sea-shanty \\"Rolling Home\\".Kevin Barry (song) The execution reportedly inspired Thomas MacGreevy's surrealist poem, \\"Homage to Hieronymus Bosch\\". MacGreevy had unsuccessfully petitioned the Provost of Trinity College Dublin, John Henry Bernard, to make representations on Barry's behalf. Legacy A commemorative stamp was issued by P&T; to mark the 50th anniversary of Barry's death in 1970. The University College Dublin and National University of Ireland, Galway branches of √ìgra Fianna F√°il are named after him.The Kevin Barry Cumann Homepage Derrylaughan Kevin Barry's GAA club was founded in Clonoe, County Tyrone. In 1930, Irish immigrants in Hartford, Connecticut, created a hurling club and named it after Barry. The club later disappeared for decades, but was revived in 2011 by more recently arrived Irish immigrants and local Irish-Americans in the area.Hartford GAA website In 1934, a large stained-glass window commemorating Barry was unveiled in Earlsfort Terrace, then the principal campus of University College Dublin. It was designed by Richard King of the Harry Clarke Studio. In 2007, UCD completed its relocation to the Belfield campus some four miles away and a fund was collected by graduates to defray the cost (estimated at close to ‚Ç¨250,000) of restoring and moving the window to this new location.

There is an Irish republican flute band named after him, the \\"Volunteer Kevin Barry Republican Flute Band\\", which operates out of the Calton area of the city. Barry's execution is mentioned in the folk song \\"Rifles of the I.R.A.\\" written by Dominic Behan in 1968. A ballad bearing Barry's name, relating the story of his execution, has been sung by artists as diverse as Paul Robeson, Leonard Cohen, Lonnie Donegan, and The Dubliners. At the place where Kevin Barry was captured (North King Street/Church Street, Dublin), there are two blocks of flats named after him.

It is one of eight boroughs in Bergen. It encompasses the northeastern part of the municipality of Bergen. Arna was merged into the city of Bergen in 1972. Prior to that, it was the separate municipality of Arna. The main population centres in the borough are the villages of Indre Arna, Ytre Arna, and Espeland. Gullfjellet (987 m), the highest mountain in Bergen, is located in Arna Location The borough of Arna has approximately 13,000 inhabitants. It lies along the S√∏rfjorden, east of the centre of the city of Bergen (the borough of Bergenhus). The large mountains Ulriken and Rundemanen lie between the city centre and Arna. Arna is geographically close to central Bergen, but it takes some time to drive there by road as there is currently no road tunnel. However, a train journey from Arna Station to Bergen only takes eight minutes since there is a train tunnel (Ulriken Tunnel) through the mountain. Takvam Station and Trengereid Station are also located within the borough, a little east of the village of Indre Arna. The European route E16 highway runs through Arna, along the shoreline. The borough of Arna consists of many smaller \\"village\\" areas, since this borough includes some of the most rural parts of the city of Bergen. The village areas include Haukeland, Unneland, Espeland, R√∏dland, Haugland, Gaup√•s, Ytre Arna, Indre Arna, Arnatveit, Garnes, Takvam, Songstad, and Trengereid. Name The Old Norse forms of the name were Arni (nominative) and Arna (dative), and this was originally the old name of Arnav√•gen bay. The name is very old, and it is possibly related to the Italian name Arno. In the local dialect of this area, the name was traditionally pronounced √Ödna. This form is still used for many other local place names such as √Ödnamarka, √Ödnavegen, √Ödnatun, and √Ödnanipa (Arnanipa). History The parish of Haus was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt), including the annex Bruvik. On 1 January 1870, Bruvik (population: 2,062) was separated from Haus to form a municipality of its own. The split left Haus with a population of 4,229. On 1 January 1964, the part of Haus in Oster√∏y was transferred to the new municipality of Oster√∏y, whereas the remaining part on the mainland formed the municipality of Arna. On 1 January 1972, the city of Bergen was expanded by merging the neighboring municipalities of Arna, Bergen, Fana, Laksev√•g, and √Ösane into one large urban municipality. At the time of the merger, Arna had a population of 11,766. Attractions Arna has a number of natural attractions. There are several beaches along the S√∏rfjorden. The Arnaelva river is Bergen's only salmon- fishing river. The mountains √Ödnanipa and Gullfjellet are both accessible to hikers. The Kr√•myrane nature reserve and Reppadalen nature reserve are both located in Arna. There are also two museums in Arna.

It is the oldest Slavic Orthodox church, with some 6 million members in Bulgaria and between 1.5 and 2 million members in a number of European countries, the Americas, Australia, New Zealand and Asia. It was recognized as autocephalous in 1945 by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.Ecumenical Patriarchate, ECUMENICAL PATRIARCHATE-Patriarchate of Bulgaria (in Greek), accessed 30 April 2020 History =Early Christianity= The Church of Saint George, Sofia St. George Rotunda (4th century AD), Sofia, Bulgaria Saint Sofia, 4-6th century, Sofia Hagia Sophia Church, Nesebar The Bulgarian Orthodox Church has its origin in the flourishing Christian communities and churches set up in the Balkans as early as the first centuries of the Christian era. Christianity was brought to the Bulgarian lands and the rest of the Balkans by the apostles Paul and Andrew in the 1st century AD, when the first organised Christian communities were formed. By the beginning of the 4th century, Christianity had become the dominant religion in the region. Towns such as Serdica (Sofia), Philipopolis (Plovdiv), Odessus (Varna), Dorostorum (Silistra) and Adrianople (Edirne) were significant centres of Christianity in the Roman Empire. The Monastery of Saint Athanasius, the first Christian monastery in Europe, was founded in Thrace in 344 by Athanasius near modern-day Chirpan, Bulgaria, following the Council of Serdica and the Edict of Serdica. The barbarian raids and incursions in the 4th and the 5th centuries, and the settlement of Slavs and Bulgars in the 6th and the 7th centuries, wrought considerable damage to the ecclesiastical organisation of the Christian Church in the Bulgarian lands, yet did not destroy it. Kubrat and Organa were both baptized together in Constantinople and Christianity started to pave its way from the surviving Christian communities to the surrounding Bulgar-Slavic mass. By the middle of the 9th century, the majority of the Bulgarian Slavs, especially those living in Thrace and Macedonia, were Christianized. The process of conversion also enjoyed some success among the Bulgar nobility. It was not until the official adoption of Christianity by Khan Boris I in 865 that an independent Bulgarian ecclesiastical entity was established. =Establishment= Boris I believed that cultural advancement and the sovereignty and prestige of a Christian Bulgaria could be achieved through an enlightened clergy governed by an autocephalous church. To this end, he manoeuvred between the Patriarch of Constantinople and the Roman Pope for a period of five years until in 870 AD, the Fourth Council of Constantinople granted the Bulgarians an autonomous Bulgarian archbishopric. The archbishopric had its seat in the Bulgarian capital of Pliska, and its diocese covered the whole territory of the Bulgarian state. The tug-of-war between Rome and Constantinople was resolved by putting the Bulgarian archbishopric under the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Constantinople and the Orthodox Church, from whom it obtained its first primate, its clergy, and theological books. Ceramic icon of St. Theodor, Preslav, ca. 900 AD, National Archaeological Museum, Sofia Although the archbishopric enjoyed full internal autonomy, the goals of Boris I were scarcely fulfilled. A Greek liturgy offered by a Byzantine clergy furthered neither the cultural development of the Bulgarians, nor the consolidation of the Bulgarian Empire; it would have eventually resulted in the loss of both the identity of the people and the statehood of Bulgaria. Following the Byzantine theory of \\"Imperium sine Patriarcha non staret\\", which said that a close relation should exist between an Empire and Patriarchate, Boris I greeted the arrival of the disciples of the recently deceased Saints Cyril and Methodius in 886 as an opportunity. Boris I gave them the task of instructing the future Bulgarian clergy in the Glagolitic alphabet and the Slavonic liturgy prepared by Cyril. The liturgy was based on the vernacular of the Bulgarian Slavs from the region of Thessaloniki. In 893, Boris I expelled the Greek clergy from the country and ordered the Greek language to be replaced with the Slav-Bulgarian vernacular. =Autocephaly and Patriarchate= Following Bulgaria's two decisive victories over the Byzantines at Acheloos (near the present-day city of Pomorie) and Katasyrtai (near Constantinople), the government declared the autonomous Bulgarian Archbishopric as autocephalous and elevated it to the rank of Patriarchate at an ecclesiastical and national council held in 919. After Bulgaria and the Byzantine Empire signed a peace treaty in 927 that concluded the 20-year-long war between them, the Patriarchate of Constantinople recognised the autocephalous status of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and acknowledged its patriarchal dignity. The Bulgarian Patriarchate was the first autocephalous Slavic Orthodox Church, preceding the autocephaly of the Serbian Orthodox Church (1219) by 300 years and of the Russian Orthodox Church (1596) by some 600 years. It was the sixth Patriarchate after the Pentarchy patriarchates of Rome, Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch and Jerusalem. The seat of the Patriarchate was the new Bulgarian capital of Preslav. The Patriarch was likely to have resided in the town of Drastar (Silistra), an old Christian centre noted for its martyrs and Christian traditions. =Ohrid Archbishopric= On April 5, 972, Byzantine Emperor John I Tzimisces conquered and burned down Preslav, and captured Bulgarian Tsar Boris II. Patriarch Damyan managed to escape, initially to Sredetz (Sofia) in western Bulgaria. In the coming years, the residence of the Bulgarian patriarchs remained closely connected to the developments in the war between the next Bulgarian royal dynasty, the Comitopuli, and the Byzantine Empire. Patriarch German resided consecutively in the medieval Bulgarian cities of Maglen (Almopia) and Voden (Edessa) (both in present-day north- western Greece), and Prespa (in present-day southern North Macedonia). Around 990, the next patriarch, Philip, moved to Ohrid (in present-day south-western North Macedonia), which became the permanent seat of the Patriarchate. After Bulgaria fell under Byzantine domination in 1018, Emperor Basil II Bulgaroktonos (the ‚ÄúBulgar-Slayer‚Äù) acknowledged the autocephalous status of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. By special charters (royal decrees), his government set up its boundaries, dioceses, property and other privileges. He deprived the church of its Patriarchal title and reduced it to the rank of an archbishopric. Although the first appointed archbishop (John of Debar) was a Bulgarian, his successors, as well as the whole higher clergy, were selected from Byzantines. The monks and the ordinary priests continued to be predominantly Bulgarian. To a large extent the archbishopric preserved its national character, upheld the Slavonic liturgy, and continued its contribution to the development of Bulgarian literature. The autocephaly of the Ohrid Archbishopric remained respected during the periods of Byzantine, Bulgarian, Serbian, and Ottoman rule. The church continued to exist until it was unlawfully abolished in 1767. = Tarnovo Patriarchate = As a result of the successful uprising of the brothers Peter IV and Ivan Asen I in 1185/1186, the foundations of the Second Bulgarian Empire were laid with Tarnovo as its capital. Following Boris I‚Äôs principle that the sovereignty of the state is inextricably linked to the autocephaly of the Church, the two brothers immediately took steps to restore the Bulgarian Patriarchate. As a start, they established an independent archbishopric in Tarnovo in 1186. The struggle to have the archbishopric recognized according to the canonical order and elevated to the rank of a Patriarchate took almost 50 years. Following the example of Boris I, Bulgarian Tsar Kaloyan manoeuvred for years between the Patriarch of Constantinople and Pope Innocent III. Finally in 1203 the latter proclaimed the Tarnovo Archbishop Vassily \\"Primate and Archbishop of all Bulgaria and Walachia.\\" The union with the Roman Catholic Church continued for well over three decades. Tsar Ivan Alexander (1331-1371), an illustration from the Four Gospels of Tsar Ivan Alexander (the London Gospel), ca. 1356, the British Library Under the reign of Tsar Ivan Asen II (1218‚Äì1241), conditions were created for the termination of the union with Rome and for the recognition of the autocephalous status of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. In 1235 a church council was convened in the town of Lampsakos. Under the presidency of Patriarch Germanus II of Constantinople and with the consent of all Eastern Patriarchs, the council confirmed the Patriarchal dignity of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and consecrated the Bulgarian archbishop German as Patriarch. Despite the shrinking of the diocese of the Tarnovo Patriarchate at the end of the 13th century, its authority in the Eastern Orthodox world remained high. The Patriarch of Tarnovo confirmed the patriarchal dignity of the Serbian Orthodox Church in 1346, despite protests by the Patriarchate of Constantinople. The Tarnovo Literary School developed under the wing of the Patriarchate in the 14th century, with scholars of the rank of Patriarch Evtimiy, Gregory Tsamblak, and Konstantin of Kostenets. A considerable flowering was noted in the fields of literature, architecture, and painting; the religious and theological literature also flourished. Tarnovo fell under domination by the Ottoman Empire in 1393, whose leaders sent Patriarch Evtimiy into exile, the autocephalous church organization was destroyed again. The Bulgarian diocese was subordinated to the Patriarchate of Constantinople. The other Bulgarian religious centrethe Ohrid Archbishopric survived until 1767 as a stronghold of faith and piety. = Ottoman rule = As the Ottomans were Muslim, the period of Ottoman rule was the most difficult in the history of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, to the same extent as it was the hardest in the history of the Bulgarian people. During and immediately after the Ottoman conquest, their forces razed a significant number of Bulgarian churches and monasteries south of the Danube River, including the Patriarchal Cathedral church of the Holy Ascension in Tarnovo. Some of the surviving structures were converted into mosques. Many of the clergy were killed, while the intelligentsia associated with the Tarnovo Literary School fled north of the Danube, where Bulgarian Boyars continued to rule in neighbouring Wallachia, and in Moldavia and Russia, both Orthodox Christian regions. St. George, the Newmartyr of Sofia, icon from the 19th century Martyrs to the church were made during the forceful conversion to Islam of many districts and almost all larger towns in the Bulgarian provinces of the Ottoman Empire. St. George of Kratovo (d. 1515), St. Nicholas of Sofia (d. 1515), St. Damaskin of Gabrovo (d. 1771), St. Zlata of Muglen (d. 1795), St. John the Bulgarian (d. 1814), St. Ignatius of Stara Zagora (d. 1814), St. Onouphry of Gabrovo (d. 1818) and many others died defending their Christian faith. After many of the leadership of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church were executed, it was fully subordinated to the Patriarch of Constantinople. The millet system in the Ottoman Empire granted a number of important civil and judicial functions to the Patriarch of Constantinople and the diocesan metropolitans. As the higher Bulgarian church clerics were replaced by Greek ones at the beginning of the Ottoman domination, the Bulgarian population was subjected to double oppressionpolitical by the Ottomans and cultural by the Greek clergy. With the rise of Greek nationalism in the second half of the 18th century, the clergy imposed the Greek language and a Greek consciousness on the emerging Bulgarian bourgeoisie. They used the Patriarchate of Constantinople to assimilate other peoples. At the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century, the clergy opened numerous schools with total Greek language curriculum; they nearly banned the Bulgarian-language liturgy. These actions threatened the survival of the Bulgarians as a separate nation and people with its own, distinct national culture. Throughout the centuries of Ottoman domination, the Orthodox monasteries were instrumental in the preservation of the Bulgarian language and the Bulgarian national consciousness. Especially important were the Zograph and Hilandar monasteries on Mount Athos, as well as the Rila, Troyan, Etropole, Dryanovo, Cherepish and Dragalevtsi monasteries in Bulgaria. The monks managed to preserve their national character in the monasteries, continuing traditions of the Slavonic liturgy and Bulgarian literature. They continued to operate monastery schools and carried out other educational activities, which managed to keep the flame of the Bulgarian culture burning. = Bulgarian Exarchate = Arbanasi. In 1762, St. Paisius of Hilendar (1722‚Äì1773), a monk from the south-western Bulgarian town of Bansko, wrote a short historical work. It was the first work written in the modern Bulgarian vernacular and was also the first call for a national awakening. In History of Slav-Bulgarians, Paissiy urged his compatriots to throw off subjugation to the Greek language and culture. The example of Paissiy was followed by a number of other activists, including St. Sophroniy of Vratsa (Sofroni Vrachanski) (1739‚Äì1813), hieromonk Spiridon of Gabrovo, hieromonk Yoakim Karchovski (d. 1820), hieromonk Kiril Peychinovich (d. 1845). Discontent with the supremacy of the Greek clergy started to flare up in several Bulgarian dioceses as early as the 1820s. It was not until 1850 that the Bulgarians initiated a purposeful struggle against the Greek clerics in a number of bishoprics, demanding their replacement with Bulgarian ones. By that time, most Bulgarian clergy had realised that further struggle for the rights of the Bulgarians in the Ottoman Empire could not succeed unless they managed to obtain some degree of autonomy from the Patriarchate of Constantinople. As the Ottomans identified nationality with religion, and the Bulgarians were Eastern Orthodox, the Ottomans considered them part of the Roum-Milet, i.e., the Greeks. To gain Bulgarian schools and liturgy, the Bulgarians needed to achieve an independent ecclesiastical organisation. The struggle between the Bulgarians, led by Neofit Bozveli and Ilarion Makariopolski, and the Greeks intensified throughout the 1860s. By the end of the decade, Bulgarian bishoprics had expelled most of the Greek clerics, thus the whole of northern Bulgaria, as well as the northern parts of Thrace and Macedonia had effectively seceded from the Patriarchate. The Ottoman government restored the Bulgarian Patriarchate under the name of \\"Bulgarian Exarchate\\" by a decree (firman) of the Sultan promulgated on February 28, 1870. The original Exarchate extended over present-day northern Bulgaria (Moesia), Thrace without the Vilayet of Adrianople, as well as over north-eastern Macedonia. After the Christian population of the bishoprics of Skopje and Ohrid voted in 1874 overwhelmingly in favour of joining the Exarchate (Skopje by 91%, Ohrid by 97%), the Bulgarian Exarchate became in control of the whole of Vardar and Pirin Macedonia. The Bulgarian Exarchate was partially represented in southern Macedonia and the Vilayet of Adrianople by vicars. Thus, the borders of the Exarchate included all Bulgarian districts in the Ottoman Empire. Map of the Bulgarian Exarchate (1870‚Äì1913). The Patriarchate of Constantinople opposed the change, promptly declaring the Bulgarian Exarchate schismatic and its adherents heretics. Although the status and the guiding principles of the Exarchate reflected the canons, the Patriarchate argued that ‚Äúsurrender of Orthodoxy to ethnic nationalism‚Äù was essentially a manifestation of heresy. The first Bulgarian Exarch was Antim I, who was elected by the Holy Synod of the Exarchate in February, 1872. He was discharged by the Ottoman government immediately after the outbreak of the Russo-Turkish War on April 24, 1877, and was sent into exile in Ankara. His successor, Joseph I, managed to develop and considerably extend its church and school network in the Bulgarian Principality, Eastern Rumelia, Macedonia and the Adrianople Vilayet. In 1895, the Tarnovo Constitution formally established the Bulgarian Orthodox Church as the national religion of the nation. On the eve of the Balkan Wars, in Macedonia and the Adrianople Vilayet, the Bulgarian Exarchate had seven dioceses with prelates and eight more with acting chairmen in charge and 38 vicariates; 1,218 parishes and 1,212 parish priests; 64 monasteries and 202 chapels; as well as of 1,373 schools with 2,266 teachers and 78,854 pupils. After World War I, by virtue of the peace treaties, the Bulgarian Exarchate was deprived of its dioceses in Macedonia and Aegean Thrace. Exarch Joseph I transferred his offices from Istanbul to Sofia as early as 1913. After the death of Joseph I in 1915, the Bulgarian Orthodox Church was not in a position to elect its regular head for a total of three decades. =Second restoration of the Bulgarian Patriarchate= St. Alexander Nevsky Conditions for the restoration of the Bulgarian Patriarchate and the election of a head of the Bulgarian Church were created after World War II. In 1945 the schism was lifted and the Patriarch of Constantinople recognised the autocephaly of the Bulgarian Church. In 1950, the Holy Synod adopted a new Statute which paved the way for the restoration of the Patriarchate and in 1953, it elected the Metropolitan of Plovdiv, Cyril, Bulgarian Patriarch.Daniela Kalkandjieva, 26. Balgarskata pravoslavna tsarkva i darzhavata, 1944-1953 [The Bulgarian Orthodox Church and the State], (Sofia: Albatros, 1997). After the death of Patriarch Cyril in 1971, in his place was elected the Metropolitan of Lovech, Maxim, leading the church until his death in 2012. On 10 November 2012 Metropolitan Cyril of Varna and Veliki Preslav was chosen was interim leader to organize the election of the new Patriarch within four months. At the church council convened to elect a new Patriarch 24 February 2013, the Metropolitan of Ruse, Neophyt was elected Patriarch of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church with 90 votes against 47 for Metropolitan Gabriel of Lovech. Maxim, the late Patriarch of Bulgaria and Metropolitan of Sofia. Under Communism (1944‚Äì89), Bulgaria's rulers worked to control rather than destroy the church. Still, the early postwar years were unsettling to church hierarchs. During 1944-47 the church was deprived of jurisdiction in marriage, divorce, issuance of birth and death certificates, and other passages that had been sacraments as well as state events. Communists removed study of the catechism and church history from school curricula. They generated anti-religious propaganda and persecuted some priests. From 1947-49 was the height of the campaign to intimidate the church. Bishop Boris was assassinated; Egumenius Kalistrat, administrator of the Rila Monastery, was imprisoned; and various other clergy were murdered or charged with crimes against the state. The communists soon replaced all clergy who refused to endorse the regime's policies. They banished Exarch Stefan, who had co-authored a book in 1948 that was considered anti-Communist.Ramet, Pedro and Ramet, Sabrina P. Religion and Nationalism in Soviet and East European Politics, p. 20-21. Duke University Press, (1989), . Bulgarian Orthodox priest From that time until the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of Communist rule in 1989, the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and the Bulgarian Communist Party and State Security coexisted in a closely symbiotic partnership, in which each supported the other. 11 (out of 15) members of Bulgarian Orthodox Church's Holy Synod worked for communist State Security. The party supported the elevation of the exarchate to the rank of patriarchate in May 1953. The 1970 commemoration served to recall that the exarchate (which retained its jurisdictional borders until after World War I) included Macedonia and Thrace in addition to present-day Bulgaria. Along with other autocephalous Orthodox churches, the Bulgarian Orthodox Church does not recognize the autocephaly of the Macedonian Orthodox Church.Ramet, p. 21 Canonical status and organization The Bulgarian Orthodox Church considers itself an inseparable member of the one, holy, synodal and apostolic church and is organized as a self-governing body under the name of Patriarchate. It is divided into thirteen dioceses within the boundaries of the Republic of Bulgaria and has jurisdiction over additional two dioceses for Bulgarians in Western and Central Europe, and the Americas, Canada and Australia. The dioceses of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church are divided into 58 church counties, which, in turn, are subdivided into some 2,600 parishes. Synodal Palace, Sofia The supreme clerical, judicial and administrative power for the whole domain of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church is exercised by the Holy Synod, which includes the Patriarch and the diocesan prelates, who are called metropolitans. Church life in the parishes is guided by the parish priests, numbering some 1,500. Eparchies of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church in Bulgaria Eparchies in Bulgaria: (with Bulgarian names in brackets) *Eparchy of Vidin () *Eparchy of Vratsa () *Eparchy of Lovech () *Eparchy of Veliko Tarnovo () *Eparchy of Dorostol () (seat in Silistra) *Eparchy of Varna and Veliki Preslav () (seat in Varna) *Eparchy of Sliven () *Eparchy of Stara Zagora () *Eparchy of Plovdiv () *Eparchy of Sofia () *Eparchy of Nevrokop () (seat in Blagoevgrad) *Eparchy of Pleven () *Eparchy of Ruse () Eparchies abroad: *Eparchy of Central and Western Europe (with seat in Berlin); *Eparchy of USA, Canada and Australia (with seat in New York City) The Bulgarian Orthodox Church also has some 120 monasteries in Bulgaria, with about 2,000 monks and nearly as many nuns.

The main newsrooms and studios for several of CNN's news channels are located in the building. The facility's commercial office space is occupied by various units of the former Turner Broadcasting System, now part of the AT&T; subsidiary WarnerMedia. The CNN Center is located in downtown Atlanta adjacent to Centennial Olympic Park. History =1970s and 1980s= The building now occupied by the CNN Center opened in 1976 as the Omni Complex, a development by Cousins Properties. The Omni Coliseum, an NBA and NHL arena directly connected to the Omni Complex, had opened three years earlier, on October 14, 1972. The Omni Complex office building was largely vacant until CNN moved its headquarters there in 1987 from its Midtown Atlanta site (old home of the Progressive Club on 1050 Techwood Drive and home to Turner Broadcasting System). Over the years, the building had provided office space to various business tenants, as well as foreign consulates. The main floor featured an indoor ice skating rink, as well as a small number of restaurants and a Gold Mine video arcade. Sid and Marty Krofft built an indoor amusement park called The World of Sid and Marty Krofft, inspired by the creations of these popular children's television producers. Opened in 1976, this park was the first indoor theme park in the United States, but it closed within six months. The complex also featured a multi-screen movie theater. For years, the theater offered showings of Gone with the Wind, which Ted Turner called \\"The greatest movie ever made\\". During renovations to install a new newsroom for CNN's website operations, the movie theater was replaced. The ice skating rink was filled in and replaced by a mosaic map of the world (the map featured brass markers indicating the locations of CNN bureaus around the world). Prior to moving to the new location, CNN and Headline News were based in a former country club on Techwood Drive in Midtown Atlanta. They shared the facility with WTBS. Since the late 20th century, this facility has served as the campus for nearly all other Turner networks and Turner Studios. During the 1990s, the mansion facade was used as the logo for Turner's theatrical and home video arms. When CNN networks moved to the CNN Center on July 13, 1987, CNN Headline News (now known as HLN) was the first network to broadcast a show from it. Their sister channel started live programming at 6.00 a.m. ET of that day. =1990s= Interior view On May 11, 1997, the Omni Coliseum closed. Its replacement, Philips Arena (now State Farm Arena), broke ground on June 5, 1997. The Omni Coliseum was imploded on July 26, 1997, with CNN Center taking on minor exterior window damage due to the Omni Coliseum being right next to CNN Center. Therefore, CNN Center was expected to be damaged. Philips Arena opened on September 18, 1999. =2000s= On April 4, 2007, Arthur Mann, an employee at the Omni Hotel, shot and severely injured his ex-girlfriend Clara Riddles inside the CNN center. The building was evacuated shortly after the first shots were heard. Mann was confronted and shot by a Turner Security Officer, and both Riddles and Mann were taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. Riddles later died of her injuries. An autopsy showed that Riddles was shot three times by Mann. The cause of the shooting is unknown. On March 14, 2008, an EF-2 tornado passed through downtown Atlanta, damaging the CNN Center and leaving water and dust in the upper floors. The ceiling of the atrium was also damaged, allowing water to pour in and partially flood the food court. CNN's library was damaged, although it was not immediately known how much of its archives were damaged. Numerous injuries and widespread damage were reported overall. The Omni Hotel, attached to the CNN Center, was evacuated as a precaution, and more than 400 rooms had to be emptied of occupancy for two weeks. =2010s= On June 13, 2014, a car crashed into the CNN Center, causing minor structural damage. The driver of the car claimed to have fallen asleep at the wheel, and was charged with driving under the influence (DUI) and possession of marijuana. Relocation from Atlanta and sale of Omni Hotel In 2014, CNN moved all of its weekday anchors and some editorial staff from Atlanta to its operations in New York and Washington, D.C. No weekday CNN programming has originated since from Atlanta. CNN's digital operations, its content-subscription service Newsource, HLN, and sister channels CNN en Espa√±ol and CNN International (which airs overnight programming on CNN proper) remain at the CNN Center. In 2016, the chief financial officer (CFO) Pascal Desroches of Turner said the company would divest its 50 percent stake in the center's Omni Hotel in favor of redeveloping its Techwood campus in Atlanta. This is where other Turner broadcast operations are based. =2020s= On May 29, 2020, the CNN Center became the scene of rioting in response to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota, four days earlier, as the building also houses a Zone 5 police precinct for the Atlanta Police Department. Rioters graffitied the CNN logo in the front of the building and caused property damage to the building's entrance glass curtain wall and APD vehicles; the front lobby was damaged, though protesters never breached into the core common area of the building, with the logo sign repainted shortly thereafter.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yve9DhT8Nt4&t;=771s On June 29, 2020, WarnerMedia announced plans to sell CNN Center. Once sold, WarnerMedia will continue to lease their existing space for several years until the Techwood WarnerMedia campus is expanded to accommodate CNN's Atlanta operations. Features CNN Atlanta Newsroom Inside CNN Studio Tour check-in The CNN Center also houses an Omni Hotel and features a large atrium food court frequented by local business employees, tourists, attendees at State Farm Arena and Mercedes-Benz Stadium events, and conference attendees from the nearby Georgia World Congress Center. CNN's multi-channel output to the world is broadcast on large screens around the center. Studio tours are available and include demonstrations of technologies, such as Chroma key and teleprompters, as well as visits to viewing galleries overlooking the newsrooms and anchors of CNN International, HLN, and CNN en Espa√±ol. The atrium escalator used to transport visitors on the CNN tour has been listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the \\"longest freestanding (supported only at the ends) escalator in the world;\\" it is long. Built for the theme park that once occupied the building, this escalator is part of the building's structure and therefore it is impossible to remove it. MARTA rail service is provided to the CNN Center at the Dome/GWCC/Philips Arena/CNN Center station. Access to the Red and Gold lines may be gained by a ten-fifteen minute walk to Peachtree Center Station. =List of tenants= * Arby's * Atlanta Police Department * AT&T; Store * BurgerFi * Cartoon Network Store * Chick-fil-A * China Breeze * CNN Store * Dantanna's Downtown * Dunkin' Donuts * Great Wraps * McCormick & Schmick's Seafood Restaurants * Moe's Southwest Grill * Natural's Ice Cream, Yogurt & Smoothies * Roman Delight * Starbucks * Subway * TJ's Sandwiches * U.S. Postal Store * Wells Fargo Bank * Fresh to Order References External links *CNN.com website *CNN Center Studio Tour website *CNN Store *Omni Hotel at CNN Center Category:Mass media company headquarters in the United States Category:Mass media in Atlanta Category:Office buildings in Atlanta Category:CNN Category:Mass media museums in the United States Category:Telecommunications museums in the United States Category:Museums in Atlanta Category:WarnerMedia Category:Office buildings completed in 1976 Category:1976 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state) ","title":"CNN Center"},{"id":"1168762","text":"BBA may refer to: Entertainment *Beck, Bogert & Appice, a hard rock power trio *Big Brain Academy, a video game *Big Brother Africa, a reality TV series Law *Balanced Budget Act, a 1997 U.S. legislative package *Balanced budget amendment, a type of constitutional rule Organisations *Bachpan Bachao Andolan, an NGO against child labour in India *Boston Bar Association *British Bankers Association *British Board of Agr√©ment Places *Bordj Bou Arreridj Province, Algeria **Bordj Bou Arreridj, the capital city Science, medicine and technology *Bilateral breast augmentation *Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, a biochemical journal *Dreamcast Broadband Adapter *Nintendo GameCube Broadband Adapter Other *Bachelor of Business Administration, a degree * Best Bitter Ale, a beer style in the UK *Burr and Burton Academy, a secondary school in Manchester, VT *BBA Aviation, an aviation services company *Bush Boake Allen ","title":"BBA (disambiguation)"},{"id":"1168771","text":"Bicycle law in California is the parts of the California Vehicle Code that set out the law for persons cycling in California, and a subset of bicycle law in the United States. In general, pretty much all the same rights and responsibilities that apply to car drivers apply to bicycle riders as well.  General applicability of road rules  CVC 21200 states that the rules of the road, set out in Division 11 of the California Vehicle Code, that do not specifically apply only to motor vehicles are applicable to cyclists. Police officers riding bicycles are exempt from the provisions when they are responding to an emergency call, engaged in rescue operations, or in immediate pursuit of a suspect.  Locations of cycling  = On-road = CVC 21650 sets the on-road position for all vehicles, including bicycles. 21650(g) clarifies that bicycles are not prohibited from riding on sidewalks or crosswalks but does allow for local ordinance to prohibit such operation. It is not illegal for bicycles to ride on the sidewalk in a direction opposing the flow of traffic. However, doing so is quite dangerous. CVC 21650.1 clarifies that cyclists, unlike drivers of vehicles, are generally not prohibited from riding on the shoulder of the road. Cyclists are allowed but never required to ride on the shoulder. CVC 530 defines the \\"roadway\\" as \\"that portion of a highway improved, designed, or ordinarily used for vehicular travel\\". The on-road position of cyclists is narrowed by CVC 21202, which requires riding \\"as close as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway\\" except in certain circumstances. The wording shall ride as close as practicable to the right is sometimes misunderstood by police officers as well as cyclists. CVC Section 21960 authorizes local authorities to prohibit or restrict the use of bicycles on freeways. Where bike lanes exist on roadways, CVC 21208 requires cyclists to use them, except under certain conditions. There is no requirement to ride in a bike lane or path that is not on the roadway. There is no requirement in the California Vehicle Code, but side-by- side riding may be regulated by local ordinance. = Off-road = CVC 21100 sets out that \\"Local authorities may adopt rules and regulations... regarding the ... Operation of bicycles, and, as specified in Section 21114.5, electric carts by physically disabled persons, or persons 50 years of age or older, on the public sidewalks.\\" Under this provision, many California cities have banned sidewalk cycling in business districts.Glendale Municipal Code 10.64.025 Movement CVC 22107 requires cyclists to yield and signal before moving left or right. CVC 21656 specifies that slow-moving vehicles causing a queue of five or more vehicles behind them must turn off the roadway in order to allow the vehicles behind to pass them. Section 21202 explicitly states that cyclists are \\"subject to the provisions of Section 21656\\". CVC 21760 requires motor vehicles to leave a 3-foot margin while passing a cyclist if possible. = Cyclist's Duties to Other Cyclists, Pedestrians, Runners, and Self = It is arguably legal for cyclists to race each other on open public roads in California if that is safe at the time under the circumstances. In traffic, or where visibility is limited (rain, fog, wooded areas, curvy roads), racing would be arguably negligent and unlawful. CVC 21200(a), provides: \\"Every person riding a bicycle upon a highway... is subject to all the provisions applicable to the driver of a vehicle by this division... except those provisions which by their very nature can have no application.\\" Under the common law in California, all vehicle operators (including bike operators) have a general duty to use reasonable care to avoid collisions with other cyclists, cars, runners and pedestrians,The common-law duty supplements statutory driving regulations: \\"[A driver is] under a duty, both by statute and common law, to operate his vehicle without negligence so as to abstain from injuring any other person or his property.\\" (Bewley v. Riggs (1968) 262 Cal.App.2d 188, 194 [68 Cal.Rptr. 520].). The standard of care is that of a reasonably careful person under the circumstances: \\"[The driver] was required to act as a reasonably prudent person under the same or similar circumstances . . . .\\" (Watkins v. Ohman (1967) 251 Cal.App.2d 501, 502‚Äì503 [59 Cal.Rptr. 709].) \\" ‚ÄòThe degree of care required... depends upon the facts and circumstances existing at the time and place of the accident‚Äô and a driver is required to use that degree of care, only, which would be required of a reasonably prudent driver under similar circumstances.\\" (Whitford v.

(1955) 136 Cal.App.2d 697, 702 [289 P.2d 278], internal citations omitted.) since it is not the case that runners and pedestrians (for example) are always prohibited by the CVC from sharing a bike lane.CVC 21211(a) \\"No person may stop, stand, sit, or loiter upon any class I bikeway....\\"  Miscellaneous  = Equipment requirements = A bicycle ridden on public roads must have a brake on at least one wheel which can make the wheel skid on dry pavement. CVC 21201 (d) A bicycle operated during darkness upon a highway, a sidewalk where bicycle operation is not prohibited by the local jurisdiction, or a bikeway‚Ä¶ shall be equipped with all of the following * A white front lamp (either attached to the bike or to the rider) which can be seen from away. * A red rear safety reflector visible from away when illuminated by automobile headlights. * White or yellow reflectors visible from on the bike's pedals or the cyclist's feet or ankles. * A white or yellow reflector on each side of the bike's front half. * A white or red reflector on each side of the bike's back half. = Bicycle helmets for minors = CVC 21212 requires cyclists under the age of 18 to wear helmets. The charge can be dismissed if the person charged declares under oath that it is their first violation of this section. Otherwise, the infraction is punishable by a fine not more than $25. Parents will be held liable for the fine.

Early years Petermann was born in Bleicherode, Germany. When he was 14 years old he started grammar school in the nearby town of Nordhausen. His mother wanted him to become a clergyman, but his excellence in the drawing of maps and his love for geographic readings made his choice of another career inevitable. Heinrich Berghaus, with support of Alexander von Humboldt had started 'Geographische Kunstschule' (Geographica School of Art) in 1839 in Potsdam, close to Berlin, following the example of the school for engravers at the Archives Militaires Generales in Paris (since 1811). During its existence Berghaus's academy offered only three courses, and only a few students attended: * 1839‚Äì1844: August Petermann, Heinrich 'Henry' Lange (1821‚Äì1893), and Otto G√∂cke, who died one year later of tuberculosis * 1844‚Äì1847: Amandus Sturmh√∂fel (1823‚Äì?) and Theodor Schilling * 1845‚Äì1850: Hermann Berghaus (1828‚Äì1890), his nephew Petermann's father, August Rudolf Petermann, who was registrar at Bleicherode, could not pay for the further education of his son. When he read the advertisement for Berghaus' school he send his son's maps and other work for evaluation. One of the maps, drawn when he was 16, shows South America, and was later published in the journal which was to carry his name.Petermann‚Äôs Geographische Mittheilungen 106(1962), table 123 Berghaus must have recognized the quality of his work, and therewith his potential and soon took him in as a foster-son. As he had already a large family to feed, however, he requested an annual subsidy of 60 thaler from the king to support Petermann, which request was granted. During the 3rd course Berghaus treated his nephew Hermann Berghaus the same way. Only Lange really paid for the courses, the rest following them at Berghaus's own expense. Petermann started in Potsdam at 7 August 1839. The education with Berghaus could be called scientifically cartographic, comprising mathematical geography (map projection and grids), physical geography (meteorology, hydrology and geology) and political geography (knowledge of borders and administrative division of European states especially). Physical training was more aimed at surveying, drafting and engraving. Berghaus's pupils learned only the rudiments of surveying, even less than he himself had learned: their work in this area can be seen in the plan of Potsdam (Ne√ºster Plan von der K√∂niglichen Residenzstadt Potsdam / nach trigonometrischen Vermessungen, so wie geo- und hydrometrischen Aufnahmen ausgearbeitet in der Geographischen Kunstschule zu Potsdam unter der Leitung ihres Direktors, des Professors Dr. Heinrich Berghaus. 1845). They were not topographers and only used topography as published in the large-scale maps of that era as a general basis for their later, more generalised works. They were taught more to draft and engrave middle-scale geographic maps of states, continents etc., or their parts (e.g. the map of upper- and middle-Italy in 1847 for Stielers Handatlas, which was based on Attilio Zuccagni-Orlandini's 1844 topographic map in nearly 100 sheets), small-scale generalised school maps, and especially applied geography and cartography as shown in their collaboration on the Physikalischer Atlas and the maritime atlas. During their study lithography, though not cutting as fine a portrayal as copper engraving, was on the rise because it was much cheaper. Though some experiments were made by Berghaus, e.g. for geological maps, by mixing copper engraving for the line- and other features and lithography for coloured polygons, there was no technology which could replace the exquisite expression copper engravings could reach. So the students mainly learned this art. Only at the end of his life did Petermann became more enthusiastic for lithography, which had advanced by then. Up to and including the 10th edition of the Stieler Handatlas (1920‚Äì1925) the Perthes institute, where he worked from 1854 onwards, used copperplate engravings as the basis for its maps. Some 460 copperplates of this edition are currently preserved in the Perthes collections in Gotha. Berghaus had been riding numerous hobbyhorses (terrain representation, isolines, scale indicators, map projections, etc.) without much success, but now he could finally put them to work with his pupils. He very successfully disseminated many of his ideas and concepts. Moreover, his students somehow learned better than he to limit their endeavours in order to bring more of them to full fruition. Though the school itself had but few students, its residency in Potsdam, connected by rail to Berlin, and the fame of Berghaus attracted many geographers (e.g. Alexander von Humboldt, Carl Ritter and Zeune), cartographers and explorers. Petermann spoke highly of his encounters with von Humboldt and has drawn several maps for his Atlas von Asien, on which the rendering of the Asiatic mountain-chains was of a quality corresponding to the then current view of the geographic sciences. Because of all these contacts the students were confronted with many opinions and views on the state of science and the world that would not normally have been part of their curriculum. Besides, we may take Poggendorff seriously when he sees Petermann as 'private secretary and librarian of H.K.W. Berghaus' in the years 1839‚Äì45, so we can assume that Petermann was at least quite up to date on many affairs to do with geography and cartography, for Berghaus had large collections of maps, books and notes to draw on.From his early years he had excerpted 'everything new, which becomes available in the geographical sciences', and these excerpts were sorted and well organised in his Kollectaneen. This habit led to his 'geographischen Hefte' (geographic notebooks) ... (Engelmann, Gerhard. 1960. August Petermann als Kartographenlehrling bei Heinrich Berghaus in Potsdam. In: Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen 106, p. 178). They also contained hundreds of pages of lectures by Von Humboldt, Ritter, Hoffman, P√∂ppig, Erdman, etc. which he later plagiarised in some of his books. He used this word himself in his schoolbook Ersten Elementen der Erdbeschreibung: Plagiatoren sind die Gladiatoren auf den Tooneel-Brettern der Geographentruppe (Plagiarists are the gladiators on the stage floor of the geographers' company') (Engelmann, Gerhard. 1977. Heinrich Berghaus, der Kartograph von Potsdam, p. 167). He alluded here to the way Ortelius had conceived the Theatre oft Tooneel des Aerdtbodems in 1571, though to be fair to Ortelius one should note he cited his sources in his Catalogus auctorum tabularum geographicarum. During and after their training, students were obliged to take part in most of the school's enterprises. In the years 1839‚Äì1848 the school produced maps for Stieler's school atlas, and Berghaus's Physikalischer Atlas,Geographische verbreitung der menschen-rassen. ubersicht der nahrungsweise und der volksdichtigkeit in den ackerbaulandern, Auch manches zur physik des menschen. 7te abtheilung: Anthropographie no 1. gezeichnet u. gestochen in der geogr. Kunstschule zu Potsdam. Gotha, J. Perthes, 1848. school atlases, the Atlas von Asien, the Prussian atlas, and the maritime atlas. British experience =Scotland= August Petermann gained commercial insight during his years in the cartography business in Edinburgh and London from 1845 to 1854. Normally he would have been obliged to work in Berghaus' school till 1849, as it was laid down in the contracts the students had to sign. This stated that they had to work for five years after they finished their studies to pay for their tuition. In 1842 Alexander Keith Johnston (1804‚Äì1871) visited Gotha to discuss several projects with Perthes. These negotiation first resulted in the publication of the National Atlas of General Geography, which contained 4 maps by Berghaus. Though Berghaus deemed the commercial and scientific climate in England not ready for scientific maps Johnston persisted in wanting to publish a translation of the Physikalischer Atlas, on which he requested aid from Berghaus. With a letter of recommendation by von Humboldt in October 1844 Heinrich 'Henry' Lange joined Johnston in Edinburgh for this purpose. Petermann stayed behind in Gotha and became teacher in the 2nd course of Berghaus' school. In April 1845 he followed Lange, who received him in his house in Edinburgh and acquainted him with the friends he had made. Together they made a tour through the Grampians, applying what they had learned by using barometers for height measurements and taking geological and botanical samples. Meanwhile, they also worked on the Johnston's Physical atlas (Physical geography, illustrating in a series of original designs, the elementary facts of geology, hydrology, meteorology and natural history etc.) and several other cartographic publications. Portion of Petermann's map of Abessinia During his time in Edinburgh he may have come into contact with the publisher G.H. Swanston, for whom he constructed several maps for The Royal Illustrated Atlas, Of Modern Geography, 1st edition published in 27 parts 1854‚Äì62. and republished probably in 1872. He also may have met in Edinburgh with John Bartholomew Jr. (1831‚Äì1893), who created many maps in the same atlas. John Bartholomew became Petermann's student in Gotha from 1855 till he was recalled to his father's firm in 1856. The German school of cartography was pre-eminent, and four generations of Bartholomews widened their knowledge by studying with the German masters. John George's son Ian studied in Leipzig (1907‚Äì08) with Oswald Winkel. His grandson John Christopher carried on the tradition, studying with Eduard Imhof, the great Swiss cartographer, in Berne and Zurich in 1960, and his son John Eric followed in 1977 with Imhof's pupil, Ernst Spiess. \\"Bartholomew is best known for the development of colour contouring (or hypsometric tints), the system of representing altitudes on a graduated colour scale, with areas of high altitude in shades of brown and areas of low altitude in shades of green. He first showcased his colour contouring system at the Paris Exhibition of 1878; although it initially met with skepticism, it went on to become standard cartographical practice\\". However, he might have picked up this idea during his time in Gotha as the colour scheme was first introduced by Emil von Sydow (1812‚Äì1873) in 1838 when he developed a color methodology for landscape features using hachures, where green was depicted for lowlands and brown used for highlands.Charles P. Daly, president of the American Geographical Society criticized this behavior in his address to the society while speaking of Animaxander's introduction of the gnomen to Greece: \\"He may have introduced it into Greece, which was enough to have the invention of it attributed to him, for the Greeks were like our English brethen ‚Äì if any one of their countrymen was connected with the introduction among them of a new art or a discovery, he was frequently declared to be the inventor.\\" Daly, Charles P. (1879). On the early history of cartography, or what we know of maps and map-making, before the time of Mercator. In: Journal of the American Geographical Society, XI, p. 5. The white for the higher reaches might later have been used by Hermann Haack (1872‚Äì1966) for his Perthes' wall maps. Several maps have been co- constructions of Petermann and Bartholomew. =London= In 1847, Petermann moved to London with the intention of furthering his geographical studies and then returning to Germany. Soon, however, he decided to follow a professional career there as the environment he moved into seemed to be favorable for his prospects. In London, he worked as a reporter for a London periodical (Athenaeum, journal of literature, science and the fine arts. London, 1828‚Äì1921), and in 1850 founded his own establishment: The Geographical Establishment, Engraving, Lithographic and Printing Office, 9 Charing Cross.http://letters.nialloleary.ie/index.php?letters_function=4&letters;_idno=406585 In 1852 the young Ernst Georg Ravenstein (1834‚Äì1913) was apprenticed to him, before he went in 1855 into the service of the Topographical Department of the British War Office. Petermann's firm published, among other things, the Atlas of physical geography with descriptive letter press (1850, with Thomas Milner), and the Physical statistical maps of the British Isles, showing the geographical distribution of the population and inland hydrography. His productions for the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society included the map Survey of the Sea of Aral by commander A. Butakoff, 1848 & 1849\\\\. He also established lifelong relationships with many scientists, politicians and explorers, mainly through his membership of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) of London. In 1847, he became a member of the RGS. When he was 28 in 1850 he was elected under-Secretary. In 1868 he was awarded with the prestigious 'Founders medal' of the RGS. Queen Victoria, at the suggestion of Robert Bunsen, appointed him 'physical geographer-royal'. Early in his career, Petermann already wanted to further the cause of geographical exploration as shown by his concern for and interference with James Richardson's expedition. The purpose of this expedition, which was supported by the British government, was to negotiate trade treaties with the rulers of the middle Sudan. Petermann, supported by Carl Ritter and Robert Bunsen, pleaded with the British government to let Heinrich Barth and Adolf Overweg join up with Richardson's expedition to assure that geographical and scientific aspects which they might encounter were taken care of. When still affiliated with the Zeitschrift f√ºr Allgemeine Erdkunde, he published their progress in this journal, and when he started Petermanns geographische Mitteilungen he followed this through. =Maps and articles published in English media= His long stay in Britain made him familiar with the best in British and German geography, and he was fluent in both languages (he had also learned French, which was a prerequisite to attend Berghaus' school), which helped him to read as widely as necessary for his further career. His love for the exploration of the polar regions probably started in London, for many of the polar explorers, especially after the disappearance of the Franklin expedition, presented their discoveries to the Royal Geographical Society. From 1848 onward he published, among other things, the following articles and maps with English publishers or in English language journals: * On the Fall of the Jordan, and of the Principal Rivers in the United Kingdom.

In stressing the geographic nature of cartography, he showed himself more a Humboldtian than a follower of Ritter's political-historical school. M. Linke et al.Linke, M., M. Hoffman and J.A. Hellen (1986). Two hundred years of the geographical-cartographical institute in Gotha. In: The geographical Journal, vol. 152, no 1, pp. 75‚Äì80. wrote in 1986: \\"There seems to be no doubt that Petermann‚Äôs work contributed to the high standards of British cartography during these years\\". T.W. Freeman has noted that \\"Fine maps had been produced in the 1851 Census by August Heinrich Petermann during his long stay in Britain (1845‚Äì54) with the Johnston map firm in Edinburgh and later in London, but since his departure the standard has declined'Freeman, T.W. (1980). History of modern British geography. London. \\". In 1852 and 1853 Petermann published some maps on cholera in Britain, explaining that the map, better than tables, can show the progress and victim density of the disease, following the example set by Heinrich Berghaus in his Physikalischer Atlas, Band II, Abt. VIII, no. 2 (1847). These were later followed by Keith Johnston in the second edition of The physical atlas of natural phenomenaGilbert, E.W. (1958). Pioneer Maps of Health and Disease in England. In: The Geographical Journal, Vol. 124, No. 2 (Jun. 1958), pp. 172‚Äì183. (1856). Maps in the Journal (Proceedings) of the Royal Geographical Society can be viewed through JSTOR. Petermanns geographische Mitteilungen (PGM) See also: (1855‚Äì2004) =Start-up of the journal= \\"From the early 1850s Petermann maintained private and business contacts with the two Gotha publishers Wilhelm and Bernhardt Perthes, and in June 1853 he actually spent a short time in Gotha.\\".Dreyer-Eimbcke, Oswald. 1997. Two cartographers who made mapping history in Gotha: Heinrich Berghaus and August Petermann. IMCOS Journal 70, p. 23. Financial difficulties and several other factors prompted him to accept the Perthes' offer of work in 1854. Early in his German career here Petermann was appointed first professor (1854) and later honorary doctor (1855) of the University of G√∂ttingen by the Duke of Gotha. Bernhardt Perthes hired him with the prospect of playing an important role in the establishment of his geographical institute. At the same time his friend Henry Lange also started to work with Perthes. When he was refused a position equal to Petermann he left Perthes and started to work for Brockhaus in Leipzig. When Petermann went to the Gotha Institute part of the original plan was that he would revive the Geographisches Jahrbuch (Geographical Yearbook), which Heinrich Berghaus had edited from 1850 to 1852. At the suggestion of the manager Adolf M√ºller (1820‚Äì1880) it was decided instead to publish the monthly Mittheilungen aus Justus Perthes Geographischer Anstalt √ºber wichtige neue Erforschungen auf dem Gesamtgebiet der Geographie von Dr. A. PetermannThis would be the title till his death in 1878. Then the journal was renamed in Dr. A. Petermann's Mitt[h]eilungen aus Justus Perthes' Geographischer Anstalt and in 1938 it became Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen. (PGM) (Communications from the Justus Perthes Geographical Institute concerning important new studies in the whole field of geography, by Dr. A. Petermann). These were to be published in 'casual issues'. Their relation to several of the Perthes atlases was plainly expounded in the preface to the first issue of 1855: \\"Our 'Communications' will differ from all similar publications in that they will summarise and graphically illustrate the results of new geographic explorations in precisely executed and carefully detailed maps. Every issue of our periodical will therefore include one or more map supplements, and their design will guarantee a continuous and easily accessible supplement in easy-to-manage form with special regard for those who own Stielers Hand-Atlas, Berghaus's Physical Atlas, and other map publications of the (Perthes) Institute. We will take special care to always present our readers with important new discoveries immediately or as fast as possible.\\"When an issue was published, most reports during his lifetime were not older than a fortnight. Stams, Werner (1978). Die Kartographie in den ersten 30 Jahrg√§ngen von 'Petermanns Geographischen Mitteilungen'. In: Petermanns Geographischen Mitteilungen, 122, p. 189. In the same preface he put the main focus of the 'Mittheilungen' on physical and bio- geography, geology and other natural phenomena, and to a lesser degree on ethnography. Its greatest strength lay in the accompanying maps, for it was thought these would show best the results of geographic exploration. In an age hungry for adventure, but not yet totally scientifically literate, this was the best way to attract the largest possible group of interested readers. The maps not only supplemented several of the Perthes atlases, but were also used as a forum to elaborate on new themes, thus widening the thematic scope of cartography. He expresses his emphasis on maps anew when he writes in the Geographisches Jahrbuch: \\"In first instance the end result and final goal of all geographic investigations, explorations, and surveys is the depiction of the earth‚Äôs surface: the map. The map is the basis for geography. The map shows us what we know about our earth in the best, clearest and most exact way. The contemporary map should so depict the earth‚Äôs surface that one can not only measure the horizontal positions of and distances between all points and localities, but also clearly distinguish vertical variations, from sea level to the highest summits.\\"Petermann (1866) p. 581. Petermann was responsible for drawing most of the maps in the first few years of the journal. His strength was in the analysis and evaluation of all sources available. As such one can say that the indication 'Originalkarte' (original map) in many titles was well earned, for few slavishly copied what explorers or other experts had sketched. German geographers, like Hermann Wagner (1840‚Äì1929), claimed that in other geographical journals explorer's maps were just copied instead of having them evaluated by cartographers first. Maps based on recent exploration reports were always, when possible, complemented with route maps from previous expeditions. He did not like to infer or extrapolate from the sources, for that might give inaccurate measurements, so many of his maps show large blank spaces. How right he was in this respect was demonstrated in 1911 when Julien Thoulet drafted bathymetric maps for the territory of France.Thoulet, Julien. 1911. Densit√©s de sondages et v√©racit√© des cartes bathym√©triques sous-marines. Annales de l‚ÄôInstitut Oc√©anographique. Paris. Republished as: Bathymetrische Karte von Frankreich zur Veranschaulichung der Richtigkeit bathymetrischer Karten √ºberhaupt. In: Petermann‚Äôs Geographische Mitteilungen, 59(1913), table 40. In these four maps he draws hypothetical isobaths, which are based on respectively 15, 31, 154, and 308 altitude measurements per for France and the adjacent territories. (A reasonable number of measuring points for precipitation and temperature maps would be 1,500 and 600 per 100,000 km¬≤ respectively to create acceptable isoline maps for these phenomenaJ. Bollmann and W.G. Koch, eds., Lexikon der Kartographie und Geomatik. Heidelberg, etc.: Spektrum Akademischer Verlag, 2001‚Äì2002, A bis Karti, p. 414.). These give schematic negative relief maps, which hardly even approximate the true relief of the territory. Thoulet wanted to show that the few bathymetric measurements available for the vast oceans would only vaguely approximate the true relief of the ocean floors. Petermann must have had the same idea intuitively for his exploratory maps. He was keen, however, to introduce spot heights and spot depths in the maps he drafted in order that others could benefit from them. =Technical innovations= Having understood well from his teacher, Heinrich Berghaus, the merit of the metric scale he introduced the representative fraction as map scale, without discarding, however, the verbal better known or local scale. The popular acceptance of the metric system and Greenwich as prime meridian was slower in the uptake. Only with the ninth edition of Stieler's Hand-Atlas (1900‚Äì1905) was this process completed. In 1870 Petermann advocated the use of a red and blue color scheme for temperature maps of the oceans. Although the number of projection methods increased at a reasonable rate, a few well-known sorts, like the stereographic and orthographic equatorial projections and the projections of Lambert, Flamsteed and Mercator, remained the most popular. Petermann did publish reports on the new projection methods of J. Babinet (1854) and J. James (1857), and G. J√§ger, but he hardly used them. Though Petermann and Ernst Behm (1830‚Äì1884; like many of the famous Gothaer geographers and cartographers Behm had first another profession. He was a physician, who learned the geographic trade in practice) wrote many articles about geodesy and surveying, they rarely got involved in other technical and theoretical cartographic issues. Petermann concerned himself much more with printing technology, especially colour-lithography. Although they produced many color maps in this way in the 1870s, more and more maps returned to hand coloring, for it then became cheaper than lithography. According to Stams,Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen, 122, 1978, p. 279. the Gotha Institute may have produced some 2,500,000 hand-colored maps for all its cartographic products in a decade, or 800 per day! In his last article published before his death, Petermann speaks enthusiastically about the newly developed photogravure, which considerably reduced costs per map while also increasing production speed. In his opinion the 715-sheet Austrian map was probably twenty times more efficiently produced than an engraved version would have been, for its production took only a fifth of the time and a fourth of the costs. In 1857 the President of the Royal Geographical Society, Sir Roderick Murchison, praised PGM for its fast reporting of diverse explorations, and spoke against the jealousy of those in his own Society who felt that exploration supported primarily by the British should first be published in Britain: he thought the Perthes Institute enriched the scientific geographic discourse.Sir R.I. Murchison's Bericht √ºber den Fortschritt der Geographie w√§hrend des Jahres Mai 1856 bis Mai 1857. In: Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen, 3(1857), pp. 338‚Äì339. ='Petermann school' also known as 'Gotha school'= Since he was not appointed head of the Perthes establishment Petermann could only guide the other skills available. Fortunately he could call on cartographers and engravers who had developed their skills through long experience with men like Adolf Stieler, St√ºlpnagel, Heinrich Berghaus, Emil von Sydow, etc., as well as new cartographers like Carl Vogel and Hermann Berghaus. According to Hermann Wagner it was not felt wise to have any of these employees appointed as head of the establishment. Instead the firm was led by Adolf M√ºller, not a cartographer, but an economic manager.It was thought that established cartographers would develop better if they were of equal rank with Petermann rather than his subordinates. Wagner, Hermann (1912). Zur Geschichte der Gothaer Kartographie. In: Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen 58, p. 77. The cartographers Petermann trained included Bruno Hassenstein (1839‚Äì1902), Hermann Habenicht (1844‚Äì1917, who from 1897 onwards trained Hermann Haack, the 20th-century editor of PGM), Ernst Debes (1840‚Äì1923. He could have come to rival Carl Vogel, but in 1868 he left the Gotha Institute to co-found his own firm, [Heinrich] Wagner & Debes, which published one of the six famous families of German reference atlases E. Debes neuer Handatlas, later called Grosser Columbus Weltatlas), Carl Barich, Arnim Welcker (1840‚Äì1859), Ludwig Friederichsen (who worked on the Stieler and PGM from 1859 to 1863, and later founded the geographical society of Hamburg and became very active in German colonial politics.) in the 1850s, and Fritz Hanemann (1847‚Äì1877), Christian Peip (1843‚Äì1922), Bruno Domann and Otto Koffmahn (1851‚Äì1916) in the 1860s.For extensive descriptions of the lives and work of these cartographers and others and their works see: * Horn, Werner (1960).

But they had probably listened well when Petermann pointed out the need for an improvement in map lettering, in elevation figures (though elevation and bathymetric figures were common in topographic maps and charts, Petermann was the first to include them in geographic maps), more accurate engraving and better coloring, for under his directions the maps of the Stieler became more uniform in expression. In this they were also guided by the more than consistent work of Vogel, and Von Sydow's critical remarks concerning the advantages and disadvantages of certain styles in his Kartographischen Standpunkt Europas. Petermann was also keen to use physical characteristics as background for thematic maps, an idea followed by his pupils. When Herbert Louis demanded in 1960 that the terrain underlying thematic maps should indicate elevations, hydrological networks, settlements and traffic roads, he cited Petermann as the first cartographer who used a terrain map as basis for population maps.Louis, H. (1960). Die thematischen Karte und ihre Beziehungsgrundlage. In: Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen, 104: 54‚Äì62. By using hachuring as a basis for his Karte des √ñsterreichischen Kaiserstaates zur √úbersicht der Dichtigkeit der Bev√∂lkerung nach dem Census von 1857 (Map of the Austrian imperial state as an overview of the population density after the 1857 census, 1860) and the map Die Ausdehnung der Slaven in der T√ºrkei und den angrenzenden Gebieten (Expansion of the Slavic populations in Turkey and adjacent territories, 1869) Petermann continued the representation of geological, climatological and ethnographical data that his teacher Heinrich Berghaus had begun two decades before. =Sections= From the start, the journal contained small messages concerning developments in geography under the heading Geographische Notizen/Monatsbericht (1855‚Äì....). Some of these were concerned with recently published literature, mainly book citations. In 1860 Petermann decided that these should be listed in a more structured way, the latter temporarily as Geographischer Literatur Bericht f√ºr ****(1886‚Äì1909), maybe inspired by Kroner's literature lists in the Zeitschrift f√ºr allgemeine Erdkunde of the 'Gesellschaft f√ºr Erdkunde'. Books and maps would not merely be listed, but also reviewed, if they were part of the Perthes library. Unlike most listings it would also cover articles from the main journals, for these, he noted, were the primary sources reflecting the most recent developments in geography. This would keep the readers of PGM up to date. Other sections of the journal were: Geographische Nekrologie des Jahres **** (1858‚Äì1884), Geographie und Erforschung Polar-Regionen (nr. 51/1871-nr. 135/1878), Monatsbericht √ºber Entdeckungsgeschichte und Kolonisation (1885), Kleinere Mitteilungen (1889‚Äì1939), Geographischer Anzeiger (1899‚Äì1902), Kartographischer Monatsbericht aus Justus Perthes' Geographischer Anstalt in Gotha (1908‚Äì1911), Milit√§rkartographie (1909‚Äì1914), Staaten und V√∂lker (1923), Neue Forschung im Felde (1935‚Äì1939), (Wehr- und) Milit√§rgeographie (1935‚Äì1936), Kartographie (1941‚Äì1945). Mapping the unknown Though Petermanns name appears on hundreds of maps, Wagner suggests he stopped drafting maps himself after 1862.Wagner, Hermann (1912). Zur Geschichte der Gothaer Kartographie. In: Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen, 58, p. 77. The report concerning the Nordenski√∂ld voyage to the Lena, and the maps of the United States and Australia, suggest this may not be true. Perhaps he no longer designed, constructed and drafted the maps, as he had with the Barth maps, but he most likely continued to play a role in the conception and design of the maps, especially those in his fields of interest. Petermann was very well aware that even topographic maps were not yet a true representation of reality (this is illustrated by the depiction of the Liparian Isles, which were not securely situated until Darondeau's French survey in 1858Petermann (1866) p. 582.), let alone medium- and small-scale maps of the interior of continents and the polar regions. One could still hardly speak of dense topographic, orographic and hydrological information. Though the maps in the Stieler looked dense with information, they were mainly filled out with information where space in the image allowed, and the cartographers had little choice what to depict by the lack of known phenomena. The density of information did not indicate how thoroughly an area had been explored, for the cartographers selected their data and drafted the maps in such a way as to give a balanced image as possible. As Petermann put it in 1866: \\"In fact, our cartographic knowledge of the territories of the earth is far less than is generally supposed. ... [In the maps,] even the African and Australian terrae incognitae shrink more and more, and there remain [only] a few blank spots, maybe 'wild territories', where there is 'nothing'. In reality everything we see on our maps is just the first step, the beginning of a more accurate knowledge of the earth‚Äôs surface.\\" Only in the detailed maps in PGM, where many spaces were left blank, could one really judge how haphazard and incomplete the geographic knowledge was. J.G. Bartholomew in 1902 phrased Petermann's drive as: \\"The filling up of the blank spaces of the unknown in his maps had such a fascination for him that rest seemed impossible to him while any country remained unexplored\\".Bartholomew, J.G. (1902). \\"The philosophy of map-making and the evolution of a great German atlas\\". In: Scottish geographical magazine, XVIII, p. 37. The results of the exploratory expeditions cried out for presentation in map form, and PGM published exploration results as quickly and accurately as possible. Petermann had all results he received from explorers checked against the considerable information and maps available in the Perthes Institute. This fund of knowledge grew to be so large that the Institute soon had a large library of manuscripts, books, atlases, and maps at its disposal that could vie with any university or society collection. In the 1980s it was thought that the Perthes-archives contained 180,000 printed maps and around 2,800 atlases.Kretschmer, Ingrid et al. (1986). Lexikon zur Geschichte der Kartographie, von den Anf√§ngen bis zum Ersten Weltkrieg. Wien, Deuticke, p. 387 In the 1990s the estimate was 1,000 m of archive, some 400,000 maps (including manuscripts), and some 120,000 geographical works. All collections (currently estimated at 185,000 sheets of maps, 120,000 geographical works, and 800 m of archives) were acquired in 2003 by the Free State of Th√ºringen and deposited with the library of the University of Erfurt in its research center in Gotha. But the maps went beyond a simple presentation of the itinerary by also describing the area explored with all knowledge available and pointing out gaps that remained to be filled in the current knowledge. So the impact was reciprocal. Moreover, Petermann gave directions to explorers in exchange for which he was allowed to publish their results as soon as possible. =Richardson's African expedition= The influence Petermann tried to wield, even as a young man, can best be illustrated by his interference, together with Bunsen and Ritter, on behalf of Heinrich Barth, who wished to take part in the Richardson expedition. He later also persuaded the English government to send Eduard Vogel after them for scientific research and astronomical observations. Petermann published the results under the title Account of the expedition to Central-Africa. When first Barth and later Vogel failed to return at the expected time Germany frantically tried to discover their fate, much as Britain had with Franklin in the Arctic area. This led to many new German expeditions to Africa (by Theodor von Heuglin, Hermann Steudner, Theodor Kinzelbach, Karl Moritz von Beurmann, Gerhard Rohlfs, Karl Mauch and others), most financed by gifts due largely to Petermann's agitating actions and publications. Many found their death in Africa as shown in the map with the subtitle Four martyrs of German science in Inner-Africa shows, i.c. Overweg, Vogel, Beurmann and Steudner. Petermann first drafted maps of Barth & Overweg's routes for the journal of the German Geographical Society and followed these up with maps in PGM in 1855, 1857, and 1859. These were later worked into the maps for Barth's voluminous work on his African voyage of 1850‚Äì55. The route maps were used in new maps up to 1893. When we compare the maps in Barth's work and in PGM we may get an idea of how the information was turned into images. The first map in Barth's work gives an overview of his routes. The routes of Livingstone have already been engraved, but have not been highlighted by coloring. The 1857 issue of PGM uses the same copperplate, but with both routes highlighted and another title. Sheets 2‚Äì14 of Barth's work are route maps on the scale 1:800,000 and 1:1,000,000. In 1855 PGM gives only a summary of the routes of the first half of the total tour, on scale of 1:2,100,000, with added profiles along the borders that do not appear on the detail maps. This was a corrected issue of a map first published in London.Petermann, August (8154). Map of part of northern Africa showing the routes of the expedition under Messrs. Richardson, Barth, Overweg & Vogel in the years 1850 and 1853 . London, E. Stanford. In the 1857 issue the map of Touareg-country is a copy, but mainly uncolored. Maps 15 and 16 of Barth's work form a beautifully drafted and colored two-sheet map at a scale of 1:6,000,000 and measures 57 x 85 cm. It depicts the approximate territories of the indigenous tribes. The other maps in the 1857 issue show rather small details of the routes, not beautifully executed, while in the text a plan of Agades is inserted (I do not know if it exists in Barth's work). All in all, there is little overlap, also because the scales used for the different works are mostly different. But the smaller maps are clearly generalizations of the maps in Barth's work. The images in Barth's look sharper, but of course that is also because they are engraved on a larger scale, while all the areas outside the routes, of which nothing or not enough is known are blank. These routes, like many others, were reused in many new maps, such as Barth's route, supplemented with the 1828 routes of Ren√©-Auguste Caill√© (1799‚Äì1838) and L√©opold Planet (1850). =Invitation for exploring Africa= PGM not only reported the findings of explorers but also was proactive in instigating new explorations. Erg√§nzungsband II of 1863 contains a 10-part map (210x102 cm) of Africa (Karte von Inner-Afrika,Karte von Inner Afrika nach den Quellen bearbeitet von A. Petermann und B. Hassenstein, autographiert von E. Debes & A. Welcker, scale 1:2,000,000 that contained all routes of explorers between 1701 and 1863. The most important parts of the map are the blank areas, hoping that they would stimulate explorers to go on expeditions to find out what new things there could be. But it was also a case of marketing PGM, as shown in the memoire that accompanied the map, where Petermann wrote: \\"The basic idea of our map was to give travellers a sure support for the choice of their routes and guarantee the direction of the explorations, to resolve doubts and stimulate the elucidation of the unknown, and to offer a means for friends at home to follow their moves and to judge the value of their labour. This by creating a cartographic representation of the least known central regions of Africa utilizing all material at hand as completely as possible, to display the range of our contemporary knowledge as well as the way this knowledge is acquired and the degree of its reliability.\\"Hassenstein, B. (1863). Memoire zur Karte von Inner-Africa. In: Petermanns geographische Mitteilungen, Eg√§nzungsband II, p. XIII. =Arctic explorations= Petermann spent a lot of time on the active promotion of his exploratory missions, especially the polar regions.August Petermann und die Anf√§nge der Deutschen Polarforschung. In: Petermann Geographische Mitteilungen, 145(2000), p. 84-85. For this he wrote more articles than for any of his other ventures. Up to 1871 he published seventeen maps of the Arctic and Antarctic in the regular issues and eight in the 'supplement' issues. He began publishing notices on the geography and exploration of the polar regions in PGM 38, 1871 (Geographie und Erforschung der Polar-Regionen started in 1865 and nos. 51‚Äì135 appeared in PGM volumes 16, 1871 to 23, 1878), and from that time onwards 195 maps covered the polar regions, but none appeared in the supplements of that period. He actually started to push his interest in this subject in the 1865 issue of PGM and with the publication of supplement 16 (Erg√§nzungsband IV) in 1865. In the PGM-issue he recites the correspondence he has with the Royal Geographical Society (RGS) concerning the proposal of capt. Sherard Osborn (1822‚Äì1875) to send another English expedition to the North pole starting from Baffin Bay. In several articles he tries to persuade the RGS to support his plan to start the expedition from Spitsbergen and use steamships instead of sledges for transport. In one article he stresses his love for Arctic expeditions by reminiscing: \\"Who, like us, e.g. has attended the accounts of one capt. Inglefield (Edward Augustus Inglefield (1820‚Äì1894)) during the session of the Royal Geographical Society of London on 22 November 1852, would be persuaded to know that the natural beauty of the Arctic regions cannot be surpassed by any other in the world.\\"Petermann, A. (1865). Der Nordpol und S√ºdpol, die Wichtigkeit ihrer Erforschung in geographischer und kulturhistorischer Beziehung. In: Petermanns Geographische Mitteilingen, 11, p. 148. Though the accompanying map shows his theory concerning an extended Greenland he doesn't write about this, but mainly about his errouneous theory concerning the behavior of the Gulf Stream. Supplement IV gives an overview of the knowledge of the area around Spitsbergen and the central Arctic. It contains articles by Petermann, R. Werner, N. Dun√©r and A.E. Nordenski√∂ld, Dr. Malmgr√©n, Barto von L√∂wenigh, and G. J√§ger, and is accompanied by three maps. Petermann published this supplement issue to encourage people and institutes to support German efforts to explore the central Arctic. The first map, scale 1:40,000,000 covers both the Arctic and Antarctica, with the routes of the explorers from Cook to 1861. He measures the unexplored area in the Arctic as 140,000 German square miles (approximately 7,700,000 km¬≤), comparing it to Australia's total of 138,000. The unexplored Antarctic he calculates as 396,000 German square miles (approximately 21,800,000 km¬≤). Petermann uses the map specifically to show the benefits of using ships for exploration, rather than the sledges usually used by the Americans and the British. He must have been convinced that the central Arctic contained vast expanses of open water and land, the latter presumably extensions of Greenland and Spitsbergen. Though the routes in the Antarctic map have been engraved, they are not highlighted in color. Instead Petermann has colored the polygons that encompass the areas covered by the several explorers. This highlights the unexplored area clearly, even though it is blank. But Petermann is definitely more interested in having the Germans explore the Arctic than the Antarctic, presumably because the costs of an Arctic expedition can be met more easily than those of an Antarctic one. The more detailed map of Spitsbergen not only shows the Swedish surveys of 1861 to 1864, but also the presence of coal fields, coastal areas with driftwood, and areas where reindeer can normally be found. Petermann's last map is in the modified polar projection first proposed by G. J√§ger of Vienna. J√§ger had developed this projection specifically to facilitate the palaeontological analysis of the inventory of animal life in the Arctic area. Petermann thought this the best projection for planning the laying of telegraph lines. North-East passage He not only promoted explorations, but also actively collected funds to realize them, and gave an account of the receipts and expenditures in several issues of PGM. In 1865 Otto Volger of the FDH (Freies Deutsches Hochstift f√ºr Wissenschaft, K√ºnste und allgemeine Bildung, founded in 1859) organised the 'Allgemeine Deutsche Versammlung von Freunden der Erdkunde' (General German Assembly of Friends of Geography). During this two-day meeting G. Neumayer stressed the fact that Germany needed a German maritime institute to be independent of other nations. One of the programmed issues to be discussed was the issue of guidelines for the use of a homogeneous meteorological logbook for the German merchant navy. In later years the maps in PGM made much use of the data thus gathered. Petermann jealously reported on the marine surveys in Britain and America, which were realized with governmental support, and he dearly wished such was possible in other nations, especially Germany. Furthermore, he pointed out that Germany had much to win by exploring the Arctic region, especially the Northeast Passage, since the English and Americans were concentrating on the Northwest Passage. Though he even tried to get Bismarck involved in an Arctic exploration project, it was shelved for some time because of the Austro Prussian war and the consequent expansion of the Prussian realm. In PGM that same year he again turned to the FDH for support. In 1868 Petermann roused so much support for his idea in the German public that his Arctic expedition actually took place. He proposed to follow a course East of Greenland, for he and other geographers were convinced that Greenland stretched much farther North than was known in that time. Though Ferdinand von Wrangel started a four-year-long expedition in 1820 to find possible land North of cape Shelagskiy and could not find any land he noted a Chucki chief saying: \\"One might in a clear summer‚Äôs day descry snow-covered mountains at a great distance to the North.\\"Quoted in: Tammiksaar, E, N.G. Sukhova and I.R. Stone (1999). Hypothesis versus fact: August Petermann and Polar research. In: Arctic, 52(1999)3, p. 240. In itself this viewing is not impossible as mirages also exist in the polar regions, as shown by Jack Stephens‚Äôs 1999 mirage image in Greenland. Heinrich Berghaus, Petermann's teacher, included this information in the right hand corner on his isotherm map of 1838 for his Physikalische Atlas with the text 'possible polar land' [Wahrscheinliches Polar-Land]. So it might be possible that Petermann based his views on this information. He published the same map of the Arctic and Antarctic as in 1865, but now with Greenland stretching over the Arctic and ending in Wrangel Island close to the Bering Strait. It shows the possible route of the German expedition. The Antarctic map now uses only two colors to delimit the areas covered by James Cook and others. Later in that volume he published two maps of the route sailed by the German expedition. Unfortunately, they discovered a finger of permanent pack ice stretching from the north to approximately 76¬∞, which made progress further North impossible. Since we of course know this only by hindsight we can understand that Petermann was not daunted in his endeavors to reach the North Pole and demonstrate a possible passage to the Pacific Ocean, even when this expedition had partly failed. In 1869 he published a map of the Arctic Ocean North of Wrangel Island with all exploration routes between 1648 and 1867 and a map with sea-temperatures in the Greenland Sea and the Norwegian Sea as observed by the German expedition. And again two maps of the German expedition in Erg√§nzungsheft 28. In 1874 he again published an overview map of the Arctic scale 1:16,000,000 now with all the routes from 1616 to the end of 1874, complemented with the new meteorological weather stations. Strangely enough the route of the 1868 German expedition is not engraved in the image. Petermann still believed, however, that Greenland stretched far into the Polar region. The text in the map reads: 'Unerforscht, wahrscheinlich Land oder Inseln (Petermann's Hypothese)‚Äô [unexplored, probably land or islands (Petermann's hypothesis)]. In the case of the polar regions, Petermann's point of view deviated from most contemporary views.Tammiksaar, E, N.G. Sukhova and I.R. Stone (1999). Hypothesis versus fact: August Petermann and Polar research. In: Arctic, 52(1999)3, p. 237-244. While many, especially the Americans and British, saw a possible passage in the Northwest, where they expected to find a passage after rounding Greenland, Petermann thought this not a viable option. But this did not prevent him from publishing many reports and maps of the American and British explorations in this area, sometimes translated from the journal of the Royal Geographical Society and other geographical societies. Though he was right in hypothesizing that the warm Gulf Stream complemented the cold Labrador Stream and that the warm stream extended far north of Spitsbergen and Nova Zembla his thesis that it warmed the Arctic needed serious revision. Although he thought it to be a deep stream he did not realize the warmth from the 300 m depth could affect surface ice as deep it rounded Svalbard and followed shelf break bathymetry eastward. On the other hand, he was wrong about the extension of Greenland. He wrote: \\"... but such an enormous glacier like the one named after Von Humboldt points at extensive eternal snow and glacier regions and this speaks for an extension of Greenland to the North ...\\"Petermann, August (1865). Die projektirte Englische Expedition nach dem Nordpol. In: Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen, 11. P. 96. His view may have been reinforced by some explorers who sighted land at higher latitudes than the tip of Greenland. While Petermann was honored in 1876 by the American Geographical Society, during the last week of a 3 weeks visiting the US, Dr. Isaac I. Hayes disputed the hypothesis of Petermann's land tongue stretching from Greenland to the Bering Sea, though he agreed that the Arctic Ocean would possibly be open water.Berendt, C.H. (1876). Reception of Dom Pedro D'Alcantara, Emperor of Brazil; Dr. Augustus Petermann, of Gotha; Prof. A. E. Nordenskjold, of Stockholm, and Dr. C. H. Berendt, of Guatemala. The Centers of Civilization in Central America and Their Geographical Distribution. In: Journal of the American Geographical Society of New York, Vol. 8, (1876), p 161. In the Soviet Encyclopaedia the following is written concerning Petermann's hypothesis: \\"He put forward the hypothesis of a warm Arctic sea and the existence of land in the central Arctic, dividing the sea in two. In 1874 Payer 'viewed' land north of Franz-Joseph-Land and put it on the map under the designation 'Petermann Land'. But during the ice drift of the Russian ship 'Saint Anna' (1912‚Äì1914) and the marches of the navigating officer W.A. Albanow it was established that it did not exist.\\"Great Soviet encyclopedia 1969‚Äì78, vol. 19, p. 470. The seeming impossibility of the Northwest Passage was acknowledged long after his death. Only in 1904 did Roald Amundsen achieve the passage. When it came to the Northeast Passage his view that a passage was possible between Nova Zembla and Spitsbergen proved right after Nordenski√∂ld's trip to the Ob and Yenisei river, and this while encountering stiff opposition and bearing the weight of some failed German expeditions. The ultimate proof by Nordenski√∂ld's trip with the steamship 'Vega' sailing around the Taimyr peninsula was published in 1879 in PGM shortly after his death. Since the map was drafted on top of Petermann's earlier map of Siberia, from 1873, this might have been a way to honour Petermann. The route of the 'Vega' appeared on a Russian copy of Petermann's 1873 map, which was reason enough for the editors to add it in their 1879 map. The map shows clearly to what degree the descriptive data of older explorations (i.e. Vasili Pronchishchev ['Prontschischtschew'], 1735‚Äì36; Hariton Laptev ['Laptew'], 1739‚Äì43; Semyon ƒåeluskin ['Tscheljuskin'], 1735‚Äì43; Fyodor Minin and Dmitriy Sterlegov ['Sterlegow'], 1740; and Alexander Theodor von Middendorff, 1843) could be trusted when drafting a map from many sources and trying to amalgamate them into a single image. The difference between the coastlines on the two maps sometimes can be as much as ¬Ω¬∞ latitude and 1¬∞ longitude.Petermann had already pointed out in 1866 that coastal surveys from ships that sometimes came no nearer to the coast than 10 German miles could not always be trusted. Petermann (1866) p. 594. Looking at Taymyr Peninsula, the channel between it and the mainland is reduced from approximately 10 km to a few kilometres by the Swedish exploration! The only exception was the information derived from P.F. Anjou (1823), which was based on astronomical observations, and is the same in both maps. The article (translations from Swedish and Danish with a preamble by Behm) and map appeared four months after the 'Vega' had arrived in Irkutsk. Hassenstein drafted the new map, maybe using the older draft. The title was hammered out of the old copperplate and replaced by a new one, while Nordenski√∂ld's data were engraved, and printed in red, making it look like an overlay on the old map. Because of the use of lighter background colors the newer map looks much fresher than the older one, though only six years lay between the two. =Australia= Petermann kept his promise, made in the preface of the first issue of PGM, when he was responsible for the new edition of Stieler's Hand-Atlas. He also had a weakness for Australia. Up to his death he published some 48 maps concerning exploration in (parts of) Australia, though hardly any of the expeditions bore any German influence. In 1866, when he gave an account of the first issue of the fifth edition (1866‚Äì67) of the Stieler, he frequently referred to maps or articles published in PGM. Furthermore, he mentions that he is working on four other maps of Australia or parts of it. One of these is his famous eight-sheet map of Australia, scale 1:3,500,000, and the other three are concerned with exploration or based on land-property maps. (Spezialkarte von Neu-S√ºd-Wales nach den Kataster-Aufnahmen, later published as Spezialkarte eines Theiles von New South Wales (PGM, 12, 1866, table 13); Spezialkarte vom See‚Äôngebiet im Inneren von Australien, later published as Das See‚Äôn-Gebiet (Lake District) und die Steinige W√ºste (Great Stony Desert) im Innern von Australien (PGM, 13, 1867, table 4); Karte der Entdeckungen im Inneren Australiens, scale 1:2,500,000, which he probably chose not to publish in PGM due to all the new discoveries). In 1871/72 he published the eight-sheet map as Specialkarte von Australien in 8 Bl√§ttern in Erg√§nzungsheft 29 (volume VI) and 30 (volume VII). It is a superb effort to compile all available knowledge in a colored map- image that measures 194x118 cm altogether, and it reminds us of the ten-sheet map of Africa of 1863. Being Petermann he would have liked to have accompanied it with a volume containing its ten-year history of exploration and discoveries, but in order not to raise the retail price of the map he satisfied himself with merely citing the volumes of PGM where the information could be found and providing an accompanying 43-page geographical-statistical compendium by C.E. Meinicke. In 1875 a second revised edition appeared, with a small sample in PGM. We unfortunately do not find his famous six-sheet map of the United States (Neue Karte der Vereinigten Staaten vor Nord-Amerika in 6 Bl√§ttern) in the issues of PGM. It was produced for the sixth edition of the Stieler on scale 1:3,700.000, though a small part appeared in the next annual as an illustration of the exploration of Northwest Texas. =Source interpretations= Several times Petermann indicated that he disagreed with the reports of explorers, probably basing his arguments on reports and literature at his disposal or on sound geographic reasoning. In a map, concerning among other things lake Uniamesi, he tends to disagree with Jakob Erhardt, one of the missionaries of the Church Mission Society of London, concerning its situation and extension. Erhardt was erroneous in that he situated the lower tip of the lake around 13¬∞ South 36¬∞ East and made it bend westward to 28¬∞ East, with a probable extension to 24¬∞ East. Furthermore, he thought that Lake Victoria, Lake Tanganyika and Lake Nyassa were one inland sea extending to 6¬∞ North. A lack of data led Petermann to agree with his erroneous shape of the lake or lakes, but he was not convinced of its wide extension to the west and north. As for the sources of the Nile he was not so much mistaken, as they were indicated by a text near the equator between 30¬∞ and 36¬∞ East, but this was not so hard to induce. When one views the ethnographic and trade information in the map and interprets them from a relative topological point of view we can see this as the strength of the missionaries' reports. As their mission was focused on people and not on the natural environment this kind of information was of great importance to them. But geometrically their information could not be trusted, in part because most of their information was based on verbal reports of the native tribes.Depending of the difficulty of the terrain a day‚Äôs march could be easily between 5 and 20 km, which can make for a lot of distortion. At other times he depicted maps of the same area from several authors together in one supplement map to show the authors' different interpretations. This was the case with, for example, the map of the Kerguelen and McDonald Islands sighted by John Heard (1853), William MacDonald (1854), Hutton (1854), Attway (1854), Rees (1854), and Neumayer (1857), with several comparisons of explorations since James Cook. The same with small maps (scale ca. 1:33,000,000) of the central part of southern Africa, which shows different interpretations by Heinrich Kiepert (1855), J. McQueen (1857) and David Livingstone (1857). Or with the representation of the Gabon countries, which show interpretations by August Petermann, Thomas E. Bowdich, William D. Cooley, Heinrich Kiepert, Paul Belloni du Chaillu and Heinrich Barth. Many times he included an outline map of Germany, or parts thereof or other countries to show the vastness through which the explorers had to travel. This must have contributed to the understanding and compassion the readers felt for the sacrifice and hardships the explorers had to go through to come to the results presented in the articles and maps. Stieler-Handatlas Since the first edition Friedrich von St√ºlpnagel had been mainly responsible for the drafting of the maps of Stieler-Handatlas. When St√ºlpnagel died in 1865 Petermann became responsible for the Stieler. He drafted some maps (e.g. Russland und Skandinavien, S√ºd- Polar Karte, Neu-Seeland, Australien, S√ºd-Ost Australien ) for the 4th edition (1863‚Äì1867), which reached 83 maps. In the 5th edition (1868‚Äì1874) we can see the hand of the master clearer, as the maps become more uniform and the style of the 'Gotha School' becomes more distinct. Fame for the armchair traveller Petermann was sometimes accused of being an 'armchair' geographer as he never traveled wide or experienced new discoveries with his own eyes, but the quality of the maps and geographic ideas he produced proves the accusation unfair. Some people are better at observing and describing circumstances and phenomena, others are better at interpretation of data. Petermann's greatest accomplishment lay in the interpretation and evaluation of sometimes contradictory sources, and his great legacy is that he was able to develop this faculty in most of his pupils in such a fine way that geography at large has profited from it ever since. Should one criticize the journal under his direction for not being geographically innovative then one may come nearer to the truth. Many articles are of a descriptive physical nature, with many intimate details in the explorers' colloquial style, and hardly any tries to find explanations for the physical phenomena. Most emphasis is laid on geomorphology and geology ‚Äî old disciplines by then with their own technical language already ‚Äî meteorology, botany and biology. Articles on anthropogeography usually reach no further than ethnographic descriptions of regions. It is still the era of data-gathering and in this they were not far beyond the cameralistic nature of the first half of the nineteenth century. One should have expected more articles concerning (parts of) Europe, but a count in the annuals for 1860‚Äì1864 shows that only 16% of the articles and 22% of the Kleinere Mitteilungen (small communications) concerned Europe. As accommodation one might say that the journal, though geographic by nature, was aimed at popular use. That was one of its strengths, as shown by its large circulation. \\"Petermann‚Äôs achievement falls in a period in which raw material was gathered, especially through explorations. It was the flowering of geographic dilettantism. Interest was not only stirred by news as such, but the news in itself was interesting, because every educated person without special prior knowledge could understand it.\\"Supan, A. (1904). Zum Abschlu√ü des 50. Bandes von Petermanns Mitteilungen. Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen, 50, p. 276. According to Weller, Petermann signed 226 articles in Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen, including 41 on Africa, 98 on the Polar regions and 37 on the history and use of cartography. The same source puts his total production of maps at 535, including his maps for the Stieler, the Physical atlas and several miscellaneous items. Stams, using the ten-year indexes, counts 280 maps in Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen that can be said to have been constructed and edited by him. Slipping and death At the end of the 1870s geography started to change its objects and goals, which upset the previously important position of what was then called the 'Gotha Academy'. When Charles Darwin published The descent of man it was the beginning of the expansion of human geography, which till then was only rarely focused upon, except in the field of ethnography. The physical- deterministic view of humanity that followed led to the rise of the branch of geography we now call anthropogeography, especially after 1875, when Friedrich Ratzel (1844‚Äì1904) was the first new professor of geography appointed in M√ºnchen and later Leipzig (only Carl Ritter ever before had been professor of geography worldwide). In 1856 Petermann had married Clara Leslie and had two daughters with her. They were divorced in 1875. A year later he married for the second time. As time wore on he seemed to have suffered more and more from family problems. It is also supposed that for many years he suffered from manic-depressive moods and he seemed to have always kept a revolver in close proximity. All these changes and troubles may have contributed to the fact that Petermann died by his own hand at Gotha on 25 September 1878. The fact that Gotha was becoming less exclusively the center of exploration ‚Äì which so enchanted the large masses‚Äîand became more scientifically focused might also have played a role. In 1902 J.G. Bartholomew wrote: \\"It is only a fair tribute to Augustus Petermann to say that no one has done more than he to advance modern cartography, and no man has ever left a more fitting monument to himself than his Mitteilungen, which still bears his name, and under the editorship of Dr. Supan, is the leading geographical authority in all countries. But to the absorbing fascination of his work Petermann sacrificed all other interests in life and died a martyr to geography\\". That fame perished quickly was shown by Hermann Wagner in his article of 1912, when he commemorates the merits of the Gotha epoch under Petermann and finds that nobody up till then had written about the making of the history of geography and cartography and that all those pioneers were all but forgotten, even though the journal carried Petermann's name since 1879. In 1909 a monument with Petermann's effigy from the workshop of Max Hoene-M√ºnchen of Gotha was erected in the Ducal gardens of Gotha, a stone's throw away from the institute where he had worked for so many years. The monument was offered by the German geographical societies. Petermann in his time was well paid by Perthes as is shown by his beautiful villa close to Gotha's railway station. Petermann lives on Because Petermann provided so much supporting work during his lifetime, several physical features, especially in the Arctic, were named after him. In the NIMA-database the following seven toponyms are listed: Petermann Ranges (Antarctica), Petermann Island, also in Antarctica, Petermann Ranges (Australia), Petermann Peak, Petermann Fjord, Petermann Glacier, Petermann Peninsula, Kapp Petermann. According to Hugo Wichmann, Capt. Bullock was probably the first to name a physical feature after Petermann, on a printed English chart of 1860.Wichmann, H. (1922). Petermanns Name auf der Landkarte. In: Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen, 68. p. 91. In the same report he counts thirteen features in Asia, Australia and New Zealand, and the Arctic and Antarctic regions, named between 1860 and 1874. Some of them were renamed by other explorers and one turned out not to exist, Petermannland, an island North of Zemlya Frantsa-Iosifa (Franz Josef Land) sighted by Capt. Fligely and named by Julius Payer, which later proved nonexistent. We may keep this name in mind, however, as a proof of Petermann's vision and drive to have the region explored, though this sometimes revealed different physical objects than he had hypothesized. In a later age, even a crater on the moon was given the name Petermann crater, situated halfway between Mare Humboldtianum and Peary in the northern polar region. Petermann thought that the naming of newly discovered physical features was one of the privileges of a map-editor, especially as he was fed up with forever encountering toponyms like 'Victoria', 'Wellington', 'Smith', 'Jones', etc. He writes: \\"While constructing the new map to specify the detailed topographical portrayal and after consulting with and authorization of messr. [Theodor] v[on] Heuglin and count Karl Graf von Waldburg-Zeil I have entered 118 names in the map: partly they are the names derived from celebrities of arctic explorations and discoveries, arctic travellers anyway as well as excellent friends, patrons, and participants of different nationalities in the newest northpolar expeditions, partly eminent German travellers in Africa, Australia, America ...\\"Koldewey, K. (1871. Die erste Deutsche Nordpolar-Expedition im Jahre 1868. In: Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen, Erg√§zungsband VI, p. 182. So the accompanying map of Svalbard is larded with features named after Barth, Behm, Berghaus, Bessel, Brehm, Breusing, Heuglin, Hochstetter, Koldewey, Lange, Mauch, Oetker, Payer, Perthes, Petermann, Ravenstein, Weyprecht, and Wilhelm. The end of an era In 1993 Justus Perthes Verlag, the publisher of PGM, was taken over by Ernst Klett Schulbuchverlag in Stuttgart. In 2003 the Perthes archives (180,000 maps, 120,000 geographic publications, and 800 m of business archives) were bought by the Free State of Th√ºringen and deposited in the Gotha annex of Erfurt University. In 2004, after 149 years of publication, the journal Petermann‚Äôs geographische Mitteilungen ceased to be published. The municipality of Gotha bought in 2010 the business premises and the accompanying grounds on Justus-Perthes-Stra√üe 1‚Äì9 and Gotthardstra√üe 6, and has started renovating the former for a future Perthesforum for research and exhibitions. The Perthes family villa at Gotthardstra√üe nevertheless was demolished in July 2012 for lack of development options. Many of the letters Petermann sent or received have been saved for future study, as also are the drafts he made for many maps, and are kept in the Perthes Collection of the University of Erfurt Gotha Research Library.

Evidently he was acquainted with Avignon bishop Giuliano della Rovere, for when the bishop became Pope Julius II Carpentras went with him to Rome, where he sang in the papal chapel; he was listed in a roll of the singers there in 1508. However, after a few years he left the chapel to work at the court of Louis XII of France, though little is known about him at this time; clearly he was composing large quantities of secular music, some of it quite irreverent, for when he returned to Rome in 1513 he specifically promised to stop writing it. He became master of the papal chapel in 1514, now under the Medici Pope Leo X, who was an enthusiastic patron of music and the arts. When Leo X died in 1521, Carpentras fled Rome for Avignon; the new pope Adrian VI was uninterested in music, if not actively hostile, and many musicians gave him a \\"walking ovation.\\" When Adrian VI died in 1523, the new pope, Clement VII, was again a fine patron of the arts, and Carpentras returned to Rome. While there he was surprised to discover his own music still being sung but in bastardized versions; as a result he carefully copied over some of his music, such as the pictured setting of the Lamentations of Jeremiah, and presented this collection to Clement VII as the \\"true\\" or \\"corrected\\" version. However, he did not stay in Rome, and after only two years he departed for Avignon, this time for good. In 1526 he became afflicted with tinnitus, a condition which terrified him, and which he described as a continuous hissing in his head. Apparently it was at this time that he withdrew from practical music-making and instead decided to devote himself to publishing his entire output of sacred music, an immense undertaking, and the earliest recorded such attempt in music history. The publication was troublesome; one of the printers failed to align the notes to staves correctly, and the entire process ended in arbitration at one point: however eventually, in the mid 1530s, he was able to issue four large collections of his music. Two of the volumes he dedicated to Pope Clement VII, and the other two to Cardinal Ippolito de'Medici. He seems to have held several ecclesiastical positions in Avignon in the last two decades of his life, including the deanship of St. Agricole, and he died in that town in 1548. Works Carpentras composed several masses, numerous settings of the Magnificat, psalm settings, hymns, motets, and secular songs, as well as many settings of the Lamentations, which were his most famous work both during his lifetime and until 1587 when Palestrina was commissioned by the Counter- Reformation church to replace them. Stylistically, his music is typical of the generation after Josquin, smoothly polyphonic with pervasive imitation. Carpentras alternates points of imitation with homophonic sections, especially in his settings of the Lamentations.

He was trained as a surveyor, and after volunteering for active service under General Tauentzien in 1813, joined the staff of the Prussian trigonometrical survey in 1816. He carried on a geographical school at Potsdam where he trained Heinrich Lange, August Heinrich Petermann, his nephew Hermann Berghaus and others, and long held the professorship of applied mathematics at the Bauakademie. He died at Stettin (Szczecin) on 17 February 1884. Berghaus is most famous in connection with his cartographical work. His greatest achievement was the Physikalischer Atlas (Gotha, 1838‚Äì1848), in which work, as in others, his nephew Hermann Berghaus (1828‚Äì1890) was associated with him. This atlas should form an illustration to Alexander von Humboldts Cosmos.at the end of volume II of the first edition of the Kosmos published at Stuttgart in 1847 is a prospectus confirming this connection It was planned to publish this atlas in Britain too, together with Alexander Keith Johnston, but it later was published in a different form by Johnston alone. Berghaus had also a share in the re-issue of the great Stieler Handatlas (originally produced by Adolf Stieler in 1817‚Äì1823, see: Stielers Handatlas), and in the production of other atlases. Berghaus's written works were numerous and important, including Allgemeine L√§nder- und V√∂lkerkunde (Stuttgart, 1837‚Äì1840), Grundriss der Geographie in f√ºnf B√ºchern (Berlin, 1842), Die V√∂lker des Erdballs (Leipzig, 1845‚Äì1847), Was man von der Erde wei√ü (Berlin, 1856‚Äì1860), and various large works on Germany. In 1863 he published Briefwechsel mit Alexander von Humboldt (Leipzig). In 1838, Berghaus became a correspondent, living abroad, of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands. When that institute became the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1851 he became a foreign member. Berghaus is the namesake of Berghaus Island, one of the islands of the Franz Josef Land Arctic archipelago. Works ;Magazines and other literature edited with his participation * Hertha (mit K. F. V.

The Grantville Gazette was the title of the first) is the first of a series of professionally selected and edited paid fan fiction anthologies set within the 1632 series inspired by Eric Flint's novel 1632. The electronically published the Grantville Gazettes, which are reaching long novel length with regularity, now make up the majority of the series in terms of words in print. Flint as series owner and editor accounts all as canonical. The Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA) recognizes published stories within the Gazettes as qualified credentials for membership--which membership requires a writer to have three published works as prerequisites.  Series premise  The first novel, 1632 and resultant 1632 series share a common theme, which is to ask the \\"What if?\\" questions common to and characteristic of the science fiction genre: \\"What if a mysterious cosmic event occurred which juxtaposed the location of a whole populated region of West Virginia with a matching portion of early modern Germany?\\" Flint added the additional query to his premise: \\"What if the two places also switched their respective places in time so that the region from our here-now traveled back in space-time to the land and peoples of 369 years ago?\\" The series lands a fictional town of about 3,000 people (Grantville, West Virginia) in Germany amidst the chaos and disorders of the Thirty Years War.  Story synopses  = \\"Portraits\\" = : by Eric Flint The story deals with the decision to smuggle information about antibiotics to hostile forces besieging Amsterdam, where Rebecca Stearns is trapped. It features Anne Jefferson, introduced in S. L. Viehl's Ring of Fire short story \\"A Matter of Consultation\\". As well as presenting the moral and ethical issues implicit in aiding the enemy, the story focuses heavily on artist and diplomat Peter Paul Rubens, whose portrait of Jefferson forms the book's cover art. The events of this story are referenced in 1634: The Baltic War and other works in the series. = \\"Anna's Story\\" = : by Loren Jones The story focus on the farmer girl, Anna Braun, who fled from mercenaries that bowled over Police Chief Dan Frost and signaled the arrival of conflict and war at the opening of 1632. It is a poignant story that was just barely cut from Ring of Fire according to Flint in the forward, mainly because Mr. Jones already had another tale in the collection, but also because of space considerations‚ÄîRing of Fire is nearly 800 pages. The story also turns to the task of elaborating on her family's fate, and introduces a lovable if idiosyncratic farmer who finds a new family this side of the Ring of Fire. = \\"Curio and Relic\\" = : by Tom Van Natta The story centers on Paul Santee, a reclusive Vietnam War veteran and gun collector, who lives isolated on the outskirts of Grantville. Set in the weeks immediately after the Ring of Fire, Santee remains unaware of his current situation until being met by Eddie Cantrell, one of several outreach workers combing the remote regions around Grantville to make sure everyone is informed about the Grantville Emergency Committee's edicts, and soliciting resources for the community. Furthermore, Santee learns that Frank Jackson wants him to join Grantville's army as a trainer of cadre, as he has more combat and years of general military experience than everyone else in town put together. Initially Santee flatly refuses to reenter military service. Reality intrudes when a band of men ransacks his remote cabin, forcing Santee to realize just how much times have changed and that he is now dependent upon others. He takes a position under Jackson and with the assistance of Eddie Cantrell begins to collect and organize the spare arms in the city, organizes an ammunition reloading program and trains residents who need help learning how to use their weapons. Going out with Cantrell to test fire and evaluate different load combinations in the three calibers selected for use by the New United States Army, the two stumble upon and combat brigands raiding a nearby farm. The down-timer Germans had chopped down several trees behind the battlefield of the Battle of the Crapper to gauge and evaluate the penetration power of the Grantvillers' firearms, and used the knowledge to create an armored (timberclad) wagon. Under fire from Santee and Cantrell, eight of the rogue ex-mercenaries use the timberclad wagon to begin to close on the position of the two Americans. Realizing their bullets will not penetrate, a wounded Santee bravely orders Cantrell to return to the arsenal and return with an elephant gun while he holds them in check himself. Santee and Cantrell managed to eliminate the brigands with the elephant gun. At the end, Santee agrees to become an unofficial advisor to the military trainers. = \\"The Sewing Circle\\" = : by Gorg Huff \\"The Sewing Circle\\" takes a canonical look at the meshing of the resource limited 'New United States' with the extant economy of war torn central Germany. Four American teenagers set themselves the goal of launching a new industry, waging an uphill battle against adult skepticism as well as the intrinsic difficulty of the project itself. Armed with a father who has become part of Grantville's Finance Subcommittee the one girl has a dinner conversation involving \\"Federal Reserve [Bank] Fairies\\", who magically make more money and regulate the economy. Another part is to convince the Germans and all the other down-timers that they are real, because they perform a very important function and it only works really well if most people believe in them. Grantville, newly arrived in 1631 has some fast talking to do to have its money stand up and be negotiable specie. On thing which is surprisingly salable is things with plastics, particularly dolls that a rich nobleman might buy a favorite daughter. Soon after, the four Junior High classmates, meet along the banks of a creek. Two, Brent and Trent Partow, are twin brothers, are mechanically inclined and the fourth, David Bartley, is smitten by the lass, the carrot-topped Sarah, who pines for one of the twins. Just to add more angst to David's life, his mother is something of an overprotective loser and his father has long departed for greener pastures‚Äîand went back to his wife. The four kids realize resources are very limited, manpower is short, and that gearing down is absolutely necessary from the very beginning. The kids' problems are just beginning. While Mrs. Higgin's Singer is nearly 100 years old, the gap between early 20th century and 17th century manufacturing technology and techniques is vast‚Äîparticularly for under-experienced would-be twin engineers not yet in high school. David turns out to have a head for organizing and management, and keeps the project moving forward with an able assist from his Grandma Higgins. She eventually bankrolls a big piece of the company, while David figures out how to make it pay. Sarah has a grasp of finance beyond her years, and teams with David‚Äîwhich he minds, not a bit. = \\"The Rudolstadt Colloquy\\" = : by Virginia DeMarce This story is Virginia DeMarce's second fictional foray in the series and like \\"Biting Time\\", the tale establishes some important canonical underpinnings that draw references, or are extrapolated upon in the various novel sequels. This protestant (Lutheran) Colloquy is mentioned often in the first printed major works of the series, and occasionally crops up in the thirteen Gazettes existing solely as e-published works. The Rudolstadt Colloquy as historical background sits at the heart and center of the religious strife between Protestant sects which in our time line continued to divide the new churches even as they collectively battled the Roman Catholic dominated world and that church's Counter- reformation, the effort to reimpose a uniform religion on all of Europe. At the heart of the matter is the strongly held belief in the authoritarian philosophy, embraced by the nobility and churchmen alike, that a state cannot not stand without a uniform official religion. \\"From the perspective of the princes, religion was important in the 'here and now' because religion here and now was a way of making the population behave.\\" To the modern mind, this seems a curious and perhaps incomprehensible point of view, but the modern man does not embrace the concept either that one class of people was explicitly set above all others and destined from birth to rule. Further, the position and power of all nobles draws from that belief and that of kings being the chosen and anointed protectors of both church and state, regardless of how well or poorly they conduct the business of taking care of the populace at large. Considered in that light, the colloquy and its results will be a major supporting event in the overall 1632 theme championing religious toleration. In the Rudolstadt Colloquy, internal tensions within the Lutheran community are contrasted and displayed. In addition to their mainstream Lutheran church, Grantville sends representatives from two smaller up-time Lutheran sects, the Missouri Synod and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Throughout Europe, both Catholic and Protestant countries either have heads of state attending in person or by proxy by sending a personal envoy to the long theological debate, which is chaired by the Graf Ludwig Guenther, Count of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt. Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt happen to be among the very nearest neighbors to Grantville's geographic position. Schwarzburg, in the fictional canon, in fact is so close that the Ring of Fire (ROF) transfer of territory between space-time continuums actually cuts through the outlying houses of the town, and several more that did not go to West Virginia in OTL 2000 AD, slid down the \\"newly formed\\" destabilized cliff that resulted immediately after the ROF, as is told in detail in \\"Schwarza Falls\\". Towards the end of the novel 1634: The Baltic War, Gustavus has charged Graf Ludwig with chairing and adjudicating an even larger colloquy in the city of Magdeburg (The Magdeburg Colloquy) to settle larger issues within his new realm. Fact Essays = \\"They've Got Bread Mold, So Why Can't They Make Penicillin?\\" = : by Robert Gottlief A fact article about the problems and process of identifying and culturing the correct types of mold, and processing and purifying penicillin extract. A story in a later volume includes use of crude penicillin extract, based on real historical uses, and some culture samples found in a lab refrigerator at Grantville High School. = \\"Horse Power\\" = : Karen Bergstralh This essay by Karen Bergstralh discusses horse breeds and their characteristics common and uncommon to the era of the Thirty Years' War and Europe. Work output, rates and other parameters such as strength, endurance, size, and so forth. Riding horses and even the gaits and tendencies of breeds for this or that trait are discussed in some depth. Literary significance and reception A reviewer for the Transcendental Basenji Sermons and Enlightenment that this anthology would \\"almost certain to appeal to (mostly US) SF fans\\" since the \\"central conceit is that small town rural ‚Äòplain folks‚Äô Americans uniquely possess all the skills of their ancestors, the American sense of ‚Äòcan do‚Äô to be able to survive and prosper in the alien environment of Europe in 1632, as well as possessing intact the political principals of their idealized 1776 fore bearers.\\" The Grantville Gazette was listed on the Locus (magazine) Paperback Bestsellers List for two months in a row during 2005, topping at number 9.

In 2014, Bass Pro Shops appealed the lower courts ruling., but was rejected by the court. In 2016 Bass Pro Shops tried again and The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission asked the 5th circuit court to reject Bass Pro Shops appeal on the grounds that Bass Pro Shops engaged in the practice of \\"reckless indifference\\" when it came to hiring practices of minorities. In 2017, Bass Pro Shops settled its discrimination lawsuit with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for 10.5 million. As part of the settlement, Bass Pro Shops agreed to strengthen its diversity hiring and recruiting practices by Posting job openings at schools with a significant minority population, participating in job fairs held in communities with large minority populations, posting job openings in publications that have been historically popular with black and Hispanic audiences, and develop a diversity and inclusion section of its website that lists job opportunities and discusses inclusion efforts. =Acquisitions= In September 2017, Bass Pro Shops paid 5.5 billion to acquire competitor Cabela's.

The strength of the confederate armies is estimated around 10,000 men with six hundred horses and some camels, while the Medinan defenders numbered 3,000. The largely outnumbered defenders of Medina, mainly Muslims led by Islamic Prophet Muhammad, dug a trench on the suggestion of Salman the Persian,The Sealed Nectar by Safi-ur-Rahman. which together with Medina's natural fortifications, rendered the confederate cavalry (consisting of horses and camels) useless, locking the two sides in a stalemate. Hoping to make several attacks at once, the confederates persuaded the Muslim-allied Medinan Jews, Banu Qurayza, to attack the city from the south. However, Muhammad's diplomacy derailed the negotiations, and broke up the confederacy against him. The well-organised defenders, the sinking of confederate morale, and poor weather conditions caused the siege to end in a fiasco. The siege was a \\"battle of wits\\", in which the Muslims tactically overcame their opponents while suffering very few casualties. Efforts to defeat the Muslims failed, and Islam became influential in the region. As a consequence, the Muslim army besieged the area of the Banu Qurayza tribe, leading to their surrender. The defeat caused the Meccans to lose their trade and much of their prestige. Name The battle is named after the \\"trench\\", or khandaq, that was dug by Muslims in preparation for the battle. The word khandaq () is the Arabised form of the Middle Persian word kandag (; meaning \\"that which has been dug\\").Nomani, Sirat al-Nabi, pp. 368‚Äì370. Salman the Persian advised Muhammad to dig a trench around the city. The battle is also referred to as the Battle of Confederates (). The Qur'an uses the term confederates () in sura Al-Ahzab to denote the confederacy of non-believers and Jews against Islam. Background After their flight from Mecca, the Muslims fought the Meccan Quraysh at the Battle of Badr in 624,Peters, Muhammad and the Origins of Islam, p. 211‚Äî214. and at the Battle of Uhud in 625.Watt, Muhammad: Prophet and Statesman, p. 135. Although the Muslims neither won nor were defeated at the Battle of Uhud, their military strength was gradually growing. In Sha'ban AH 4 (October 625) The source gives January 626 according to the fixed calendar, which did not come into use for another six years. Muhammad raised a force of 300 men and 10 horses to meet the Quraysh army of 1,000 at Badr for the second time. Although no fighting occurred, the coastal tribes were impressed with Muslim power. Muhammad also tried, with limited success, to break up many alliances against the Muslim expansion. Nevertheless, he was unable to prevent the Meccan one.Watt, Muhammad at Medina, pp. 34‚Äì37. As they had in the battles of Badr and Uhud, the Muslim army again used strategic methods against their opponents (at Badr, the Muslims surrounded the wells, but did not deprive their opponents of water since Ali did not want to follow the footsteps of the Meccan army; at the Battle of Uhud, Muslims made strategic use of the hills). In this battle they dug a trench to render the enemy cavalry ineffective. =Reason for battle= The reason for this battle was to save Medina from attack, after Banu Nazir and Banu Qurayzah tribes formed an alliance with the Quraysh to attack him as revenge for expelling them from Medina during the Invasion of Banu Qaynuqa and Invasion of Banu Nadir.Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar, pp. 196‚Äì198. (online) The Muslim scholar Ibn Kathir states: \\"The reason why the Confederates came was that a group of the leaders of the Banu Nadir, whom the Messenger of Allah had expelled from Al-Madinah to Khaybar, including Sallam bin Abu Al-Huqayq, Sallam bin Mishkam and Kinanah bin Ar-Rabi\`, went to Makkah where they met with the leaders of Quraysh and incited them to make war against the Prophet\\"Muhammad Saed Abdul-Rahman, Tafsir Ibn Kathir Juz' 21 (Part 21): Al- Ankaboot 46 to Al-Ahzab 30 2nd Edition, p. 122, MSA Publication Limited, 2009, . (online) The Confederates Early in 627, the Banu Nadir met with the Quraysh of Mecca. Huyayy ibn Akhtab, along with other leaders from Khaybar, travelled to swear allegiance with Safwam ibn Umayya at Mecca. The bulk of the Confederate armies were gathered by the Quraysh of Makkah, led by Abu Sufyan, who fielded 4,000 foot soldiers, 300 horsemen, and 1,000‚Äì1,500 men on camels. The Banu Nadir began rousing the nomads of Najd. The Nadir enlisted the Banu Ghatafan by paying them half of their harvest. This contingent, the second largest, added a strength of about 2,000 men and 300 horsemen led by Unaina bin Hasan Fazari. The Bani Assad also agreed to join, led by Tuleha Asadi.al- Halabi, al-Sirat al-Halbiyyah, p. 19. From the Banu Sulaym, the Nadir secured 700 men, though this force would likely have been much larger had not some of its leaders been sympathetic towards Islam. The Bani Amir, who had a pact with Muhammad, refused to join.Lings, Muhammad: his life based on the earliest sources, pp. 215f. Other tribes included the Banu Murra, with 400 men led by Hars ibn Auf Murri, and the Banu Shuja, with 700 men led by Sufyan ibn Abd Shams. In total, the strength of the Confederate armies, though not agreed upon by scholars, is estimated to have included around 10,000 men and six hundred horsemen. In December 626 the army, which was led by Abu Sufyan, marched on Medina.Rodinson, Muhammad: Prophet of Islam, p. 208. In accordance with the plan the armies began marching towards Medina, Meccans from the south (along the coast) and the others from the east. At the same time horsemen from the Banu Khuza'a left to warn Medina of the invading army. Muslim defence The men from Banu Khuza'a reached Muhammad in four days, warning him of the Confederate armies that were to arrive in a week. Muhammad gathered the Medinans to discuss the best strategy of overcoming the enemy. Meeting the enemy in the open (which led to victory at Badr), and waiting for them inside the city (a lesson learnt from the defeat at Uhud) were both suggested. Ultimately, the outnumbered Muslims opted to engage in a defensive battle by digging deep trenches to act as a barrier along the northern front. The tactic of a defensive trench was introduced by Salman the Persian. Every capable Muslim in Medina including Muhammad contributed to digging the massive trench in six days.Rodinson, p. 209. The ditch was dug on the northern side only, as the rest of Medina was surrounded by rocky mountains and trees, impenetrable to large armies (especially cavalry). The digging of the ditch coincided with a near-famine in Medina. Women and children were moved to the inner city. The Medinans harvested all their crops early, so the Confederate armies would have to rely on their own food reserves. Muhammad established his military headquarters at the hillock of Sala' and the army was arrayed there; this position would give the Muslims an advantage if the enemy crossed the trench. The final army that would defend the city from the invasion consisted of 3,000 men,Glasse & Smith, New Encyclopedia of Islam: A Revised Edition of the Concise Encyclopedia of Islam, p. 81. and included all inhabitants of Medina over the age of 14, except the Banu Qurayza (the Qurayza did supply the Muslims with some instruments for digging the trench). According to Irfan Shahid, the Muslims adopted the tactic of using trenches from the Persians, possibly via the Ghassanid Arabs who saw their king killed at the Battle of Thannuris in 527 by this tactic. The adopting is reflected in the Arabic word for this battle, khandaq (), which is a borrowing via Aramaic from Pahlavi kandak. Siege of Medina The siege of Medina began in January 627 and lasted for 20 nights.Watt, Muhammad at Medina, p. 36f. Adding in the six days of trench-building, the entire operation lasted 27 daysWatt, Muhammad at Medina, p. 36f. and was contained within a single month (5 Shawwal-1 Dhu al- Qi'dah). Since sieges were uncommon in Arabian warfare, the arriving Confederates were unprepared to deal with the trenches dug by the Muslims. The Confederates tried to attack with horsemen in hopes of forcing a passage, but the Medinans were rigidly entrenched, preventing such a crossing.Watt, Muhammad: Prophet and Statesman, pp. 167‚Äì174. Both of the armies gathered on either side of the trench and spent two or three weeks exchanging insults in prose and verse, backed up with arrows fired from a comfortable distance. According to Rodinson, there were three dead among the attackers and five among the defenders. On the other hand, the harvest had been gathered and the besiegers had some trouble finding food for their horses, which proved of no use to them in the attack.Rodinson, pp. 209f. The Quraysh veterans grew impatient with the deadlock. A group of militants led by ‚ÄòAmr ibn ‚ÄòAbd Wudd (who was thought to be equal to a thousand men in fighting)Tabqaar ibn-e-Sadd 1:412, Anwaar Mohammadiya minal mawahib Page 84. and Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl attempted to thrust through the trench and managed to effect a crossing, occupying a marshy area near the hillock of Sala. 'Amr challenged the Muslims to a duel. In response, Ali ibn Abi Talib accepted the challenge, and was sent by Muhammad to fight. As Ali went to fight Amr ibn Abd Wudd, Muhammad said about Ali, \\"He is the embodiment of all Faith who is going to an encounter with the embodiment of all Unbelief.\\" Both the fighters got lost in the dust as the duel became intense. Finally, the soldiers heard scream(s) which hinted decisive blows, but it was unclear which of the two was successful. The slogan, 'Allahu Akbar' (God is the greatest) from the dust confirmed Ali's victory. The confederates were forced to withdraw in a state of panic and confusion.Zafrulla Khan, Muhammad, Seal of the Prophets, pp. 177‚Äì179. Ali, as per his principles, allowed Amr's entourage to retreat; Ali never pursued a fleeing enemy. The Confederate army made several other attempts to cross the trench during the night but repeatedly failed. Although the confederates could have deployed their infantry over the whole length of the trench, they were unwilling to engage the Muslims at close quarter as the former regarded the latter as superior in hand-to-hand fighting. As the Muslim army was well dug- in behind the embankment made from the earth which had been taken from the ditch and prepared to bombard attackers with stones and arrows, any attack could cause great casualties. =Banu Qurayza= The Confederates attempted several simultaneous attacks, in particular by trying to persuade the Banu Qurayza to attack the Muslims from the south. From the Confederates, Huyayy ibn Akhtab, a Khaybarian, the leader of the exiled tribe Banu Nadir, returned to Medina seeking their support against the Muslims.Nomani, p. 382. So far the Banu Qurayza had tried their best to remain neutral, and were very hesitant about joining the Confederates since they had earlier made a pact with Muhammad. When Huyayy approached them, their leader refused to allow him entry.Lings, pp. 221‚Äì223. Huyayy eventually managed to enter and persuade them that the Muslims would surely be overwhelmed. The sight of the vast Confederate armies, surging over the land with soldiers and horses as far as the eye could see, swung the Qurayza opinion in the favour of the Confederacy. News of the Qurayzah's supposed renunciation of the pact with Muhammad leaked out, and Umar promptly informed Muhammad. Such suspicions were reinforced by the movement of enemy troops towards the strongholds of the Qurayza.Ramadan, In the Footsteps of the Prophet, pp. 137‚Äì145. Muhammad became anxious about their conduct,Watt, \\"Kurayza, Banu\\" Encyclopaedia of Islam. and realised the grave potential danger the Qurayza posed. Because of his pact with the Qurayza, he had not bothered to make defensive preparations along the Muslims' border with the tribe. The Qurayza also possessed weaponry: 1,500 swords, 2,000 lances, 300 suits of armour, and 500 shields.Heck, \\"Arabia Without Spices: An Alternate Hypothesis\\", pp. 547‚Äì567. Muhammad sent three leading Muslims to bring him details of the recent developments. He advised the men to openly declare their findings, should they find the Banu Qurayza to be loyal, so as to increase the morale of the Muslim fighters. However, he warned against spreading the news of a possible breach of the pact on the Qurayza's part, so as to avoid any panic within Muslim ranks. The leaders found that the pact indeed had been renounced and tried in vain to convince the Qurayza to revert by reminding them of the fate of the Banu Nadir and Banu Qaynuqa at the hands of Muhammad. The findings of the leaders were signalled to Muhammad in a metaphor: \\"Adal and Qarah\\". Because the people of Adal and Qarah had betrayed the Muslims and killed them at the opportune moment, Maududi believes the metaphor means the Qurayza were thought to be about to do the same.Maududi, The Meaning of the Quran, p. 64f. =Crisis in Medina= Muhammad attempted to hide his knowledge of the activities of Banu Qurayza; however, rumours soon spread of a massive assault on the city of Medina from Qurayza's side which severely demoralised the Medinans.Peterson, Muhammad. Prophet of God, p. 123f. The Muslims found themselves in greater difficulties by day. Food was running short, and nights were colder. The lack of sleep made matters worse. So tense was the situation that, for the first time, the canonical daily prayers were neglected by the Muslim community. Only at night, when the attacks stopped due to darkness, could they resume their regular worship. According to Ibn Ishaq, the situation became serious and fear was everywhere.Peters Muhammad and the Origins of Islam, p. 221f. Quran describes the situation in surah Al-Ahzab: =Muslim response= Immediately after hearing the rumours about the Qurayza, Muhammad had sent 100 men to the inner city for its protection. Later he sent 300 horsemen (cavalry was not needed at the trench) as well to protect the city. The loud voices, in which the troops prayed every night, created the illusion of a large force. The crisis showed Muhammad that many of his men had reached the limits of their endurance. He sent word to Ghatafan, trying to pay for their defection and offering them a third of Medina's date harvest if they withdrew. Although the Ghatafan demanded half, they eventually agreed to negotiating with Muhammad on those terms. Before Muhammad began the order of drafting the agreement, he consulted the Medinan leaders. They sharply rejected the terms of the agreement,Lings, pp. 224‚Äì226. protesting Medina had never sunk to such levels of ignominy. The negotiations were broken off. While the Ghatafan did not retreat they had compromised themselves by entering into negotiations with Medina, and the Confederacy's internal dissension had thereby been increased. At about that point, Muhammad received a visit from Nuaym ibn Masud, an Arab leader who was well-respected by the entire confederacy, but who had, unknown to them, secretly converted to Islam. Muhammad asked him to end the siege by creating discord amongst Confederates. Nuaym then came up with an efficient stratagem. He first went to the Banu Qurayza and warned them about the intentions of the rest of the Confederacy. If the siege fails, he said, the Confederacy will not be afraid to abandon the Jews, leaving them at the mercy of Muhammad. The Qurayza should thus demand Confederate leaders as hostages in return for cooperation. This advice touched upon the fears the Qurayza had already harboured. Next Nuaym went to Abu Sufyan, the Confederate leader, warning him that the Qurayza had defected to Muhammad. He stated that the tribe intended to ask the Confederacy for hostages, ostensibly in return for cooperation, but really to hand over to Muhammad. Thus the Confederacy should not give a single man as hostage. Nuaym repeated the same message to other tribes in the Confederacy. =Collapse of the Confederacy= Nuaym's stratagem worked. After consulting, the Confederate leaders sent Ikrimah to the Qurayza, signalling a united invasion of Medina. The Qurayza, however, demanded hostages as a guarantee that the Confederacy would not desert them. The Confederacy, considering that the Qurayza might give the hostage to Muhammad, refused. Messages were repeatedly sent back and forth between the parties, but each held to its position stubbornly. Abu Sufyan summoned Huyayy ibn Akhtab, informing him of Qurayza's response. Huyayy was taken aback, and Abu Sufyan branded him as a \\"traitor\\". Fearing for his life, Huyayy fled to the Qurayza's strongholds. The Bedouins, the Ghatafan, and other Confederates from Najd had already been compromised by Muhammad's negotiations. They had taken part in the expedition in hopes of plunder, rather than for personal reasons. They lost hope as chances of success dwindled, uninterested in continuing the siege. The two confederate armies were marked by recriminations and mutual distrust. The provisions of the Confederate armies were running out. Horses and camels were dying of hunger and wounds. For days the weather had been exceptionally cold and wet. Violent winds blew out the camp fires, taking away from the Confederate army their source of heat. The Muslim camp, however, was sheltered from such winds. The enemy‚Äôs tents were torn up, their fires were extinguished, the sand and rain beat in their faces, and they were terrified by the portents against them. They had already well nigh fallen out among themselves. During the night the Confederate armies withdrew, and by morning the ground was cleared of all enemy forces.Lings, pp. 227f. Aftermath: Siege and demise of the Banu Qurayza Following the retreat of the Confederate army, the Banu Qurayza neighbourhoods were besieged by the Muslims. After a 25-day siege of their neighbourhood the Banu Qurayza unconditionally surrendered. When the Banu Qurayza tribe surrendered, the Muslim army seized their stronghold and their possessions.Watt, Muhammad: Prophet and Statesman, pp. 170‚Äì176. On the request of the Banu Aus, who were allied to the Qurayza, Muhammad chose one of them, Sa'ad ibn Mu'adh, as an arbitrator to pronounce judgment upon them. Sa'ad, who would later die of his wounds from the battle, decreed the sentence, in which the men shall be killed and women and children enslaved. Muhammad approved of this decision, and the next day the sentence was carried out. The men ‚Äì numbering between 400 and 900Guillaume, The Life of Muhammad: A Translation of Ibn Ishaq's Sirat Rasul Allah, p. 461-464. ‚Äì were bound and placed under the custody of Muhammad ibn Maslamah, while the women and children were placed under Abdullah ibn Salam, a former rabbi who had converted to Islam.Muir, A Life of Mahomet and History of Islam to the Era of the Hegira, pp. 272‚Äì274. Ibn Ishaq describes the killing of the Banu Qurayza men as follows: A number of individuals were spared when various Muslims intervened on their behalf. Several accounts note Muhammad's companions as executioners, Umar and Al- Zubayr in particular, and that each clan of the Aws was also charged with killing a group of Qurayza men.Kister, \\"The Massacre of the Banu Quraiza\\", p. 93f.Inamdar, Muhammad and the Rise of Islam, pp. 166f. According to Ibn Ishaq's biography of Muhammad, one woman who had thrown a millstone from the battlements during the siege and killed one of the Muslim besiegers, was also beheaded along with the men. '√É'isha, one of Mohammad's wives, is cited as describing the woman as laughing and chatting with her during the massacre, down to the moment her name was called out: > 'By Allah,' she said,' that is me.' I said to her 'You poor soul, what is to > happen to you?' She said:\\"I must be killed.\\" \\"Why?\\" I asked her. \\"For > something I did,\\" she answered. She went away and was beheaded. By > Allah,('√É'isha adds) I shall never forget her cheerfulness and her great > laugh when she knew that she was to be killed.'Maxime Rodinson, Mohammad, > (1961) Penguin Books 1971 p.213.Muir (p. 277) (Ibn Ishaq, Biography of > Muhammad). Ibn Asakir writes in his History of Damascus that the Banu Kilab, a clan of Arab clients of the Banu Qurayza, were also killed.Lecker, \\"On Arabs of the Ban≈´ KilƒÅb executed together with the Ban≈´ Qurayza\\", p. 69. The spoils of battle, including the enslaved women and children of the tribe, were divided up among the Muslims that had participated in the siege and among the emigrees from Mecca (who had hitherto depended on the help of the Muslims native to Medina.Kister, \\"The Massacre of the Banu Quraiza\\", pp. 95f.Rodinson, Muhammad: Prophet of Islam, p. 213. As part of his share of the spoils, Muhammad selected one of the women, Rayhana, for himself and took her as part of his booty. Muhammad offered to free and marry her and according to some sources she accepted his proposal, while according to others she rejected it and remained Muhammad's slave.Ramadan, p. 146. She is said to have later become a Muslim. Scholars argue that Muhammad had already decided upon this judgment before the Qurayza's surrender, and that Sa'ad was putting his allegiance to the Muslim community above that to his tribe. One reason cited by some for such punishment is that Muhammad's previous clemency towards defeated foes was in contradiction to Arab and Jewish laws of the time, and was seen as a sign of weakness. Others see the punishment as a response to what was perceived as an act of treason by the Qurayza since they betrayed their joint defence pact with Muhammad by giving aid and comfort to the enemies of the Muslims. Implications The failure of the siege marked the beginning of Muhammad's undoubted political ascendancy in the city of Medina.Watt, Muhammad: Prophet and Statesman, p. 96. The Meccans had exerted their utmost strength to dislodge Muhammad from Medina, and this defeat caused them to lose their trade with Syria and much of their prestige with it. Watt conjectures that the Meccans at this point began to contemplate that conversion to Islam would be the most prudent option. Islamic primary sources =Quran= The main contemporary source of the battle is the 33rd Surah of the Quran. The Sunni Muslim Mufassir Ibn Kathir mentions that is about this incident in his book Tafsir ibn Kathir, and his commentary on this verse mentions the reason and event of the Battle, his commentary is as follows: =Hadith= The event is referenced in the Sunni, Hadith collection Sahih al-Bukhari, it mentions the death of Sa'd ibn Mu'adh, as follows: The Sahih al-Bukhari collection also mentions that after the battle, Muslims were to carry out offensive attacks against their enemies:Dr. M. Sa‚Äôid Ramadan Al-Buti ‚Äì \\"Jurisprudence of Muhammad‚Äôs Biography\\", p. 73, English edition, published by Azhar University of Egypt (1988). Muhammad in order to stop the attacks called for a counter attack against the idolaters, He asserted to his followers before: Abdullah bin Abu Aufa reported: The Messenger of Allah (Ô∑∫) at one time when he confronted the enemy, and was waiting for the sun to set, stood up and said, \\"O people! Do not long for encountering the enemy and supplicate to Allah to grant you security. But when you face the enemy, show patience and steadfastness; and keep it in mind that Jannah lies under the shade of the swords.\\" Then he invoked Allah, saying, \\"O Allah, Revealer of the Book, Disperser of the clouds, Defeater of the Confederates, put our enemy to rout and help us in over-powering them\\". [Al- Bukhari and Muslim].(46) The event is also mentioned in the Sahih Muslim Hadith collection as follows: =Biographical literature= The incident also is mentioned in the historical works by writers of the third and fourth century of the Muslim era.Watt, Muhammad at Mecca, p. xi. These include the traditional Muslim biographies of Muhammad, and quotes attributed to him (the sira and hadith literature), which provide further information on Muhammad's life.Reeves, Muhammad in Europe: A Thousand Years of Western Myth-Making, p. 6‚Äì7. The earliest surviving written sira (biographies of Muhammad and quotes attributed to him) is Ibn Ishaq's Life of God's Messenger written some 120 to 130 years after Muhammad's death. Although the original work is lost, portions of it survive in the recensions of Ibn Hisham and Al-Tabari.Donner, Narratives of Islamic Origins: The Beginnings of Islamic Historical Writing, p. 132. Another early source is the history of Muhammad's campaigns by al-Waqidi (d. 823).  Early Arabic rock inscription  A rock inscription was discovered in mount Sela; In the fourth and fifth line appear the words, ‚ÄúI am Muhammad bin Abdullah‚Äù and that is the full name of the prophet Muhammad as his father was Abdullah. In the eighth line is the name, ‚Äú I am Salman the (?)‚Äù. In the twelfth line is the phrase ‚ÄúI am Sa'd bin Mu'adh‚Äù, and finally on the fifteenth line ‚ÄúI am Ali bin Abu Talib‚Äù.As it is known that Saad ibn Muad died in 627, the inscription can not be from a later era, further the location of this inscription may hint that it was meant to commemorate the Muslim victory in the battle.

Afterwards, he was promoted to the rank of Oberleutnant in 1880. From 1881 to 1883 he studied at the military academy in Vienna. Between 1887 and 1891 he underwent additional military training and worked as an instructor after that, and he would begin his teaching at the Theresian Military Academy. He would finish teaching there in 1891. Svetozar became a major in May 1892. In May 1895, he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. He would take control over a battalion of the 17th Infantry Regiment during the month of April in 1896. In November 1897 he was promoted to Colonel. Later he was appointed to chief of staff of the Seventh Corps of the Imperial & Royal Army in June 1898, where he remained until February 1904. In 1904, he was promoted Major General and took control of the 14th Infantry Brigade. In May 1905, he was created a Hungarian nobleman (since Croatia was one of the Lands of the Holy Hungarian Crown) with the attribute von Bojna by the Emperor & King. From 1907 to 1912 he commanded to VII Landwehr Division. On May 1, 1908, the monarch made him Field Marshal Lieutenant (Feldmarschallleutnant). In September 1909 he was put in charge of the VI Corps in Kosisce. He became the commander of the Sixth Corps of the I & R Army in April 1912 and on May 1, 1913 General of the Infantry. World War I = Early War = Svetozar Boroeviƒá When World War I started in 1914 he was in command of the Sixth Corps on Galicia in the Eastern Front. He would distinguish himself at these battles. On September 1, 1914 he became commander of the Third Army. He would fight at the Battle of Komar√≥w. Later, in early October he liberated Fort Przemysl, providing a temporary relief in the Siege of Przemy≈õl. His troops then pulled back to hold positions around Limanowa, at the Dukla mountain pass, and elsewhere on the Carpathians, stopping the Russians from breaking out on the Danube. The Russian counter-offensive in February and March 1915 almost managed to push Boroeviƒá's Third Army back towards Hungary, but they managed to hold just enough for the German reinforcements to arrive and save the already endangered Budapest and the Pressburg bridgehead. They then proceeded to join the general Austro- Hungarian‚ÄîGerman offensive (with the Austro-Hungarian Fourth Army under Archduke Joseph Ferdinand and the German Eleventh Army under Mackensen) that pushed back the Russians and eventually retook Przemysl. = Isonzo Front = His actions on other sections of the war appealed to Emperor Francis Joseph and on May 25, 1915 he was given command on the Isonzo front. He arrived on May 27 with part of the Third Army with him and leaving the rest to Army Group Mackensen. There Boroeviƒá became the Commander of the Fifth Army, with which he organized a defense against the Italians to break countless offensives. He finished building defenses and managing the logistics of his army by the end of May. While there, Boroeviƒá's troops contained eleven Italian attacks and he was hailed as the Knight of Isonzo in Austria-Hungary, while his soldiers adored him and called him Na≈° Sveto! (\\"Our Sveto!\\"). For valor in combat, he was promoted to the rank of Generaloberst on 1 May 1916. On 23 August 1917 he rose to the position of commander of the Southwestern Front, which was later renamed Army Group Boroeviƒá. He would later fight at the Battle of Caporetto. In January 1918, he opposed Hungarian proposals to split Austria-Hungary's Army into separate Austrian and Hungarian units. He became Field Marshal on 1 February 1918 and was also awarded numerous medals, including the highest order for Austro-Hungarian soldiers, the Military Order of Maria Theresia. He led to defeat the southern prong of the last Austro- Hungarian offensive at the Battle of the Piave River.Raab, David \\"Battle of the Piave: Death of the Austro-Hungarian Army, 1918\\" (2004) pag. 77 The front was maintained until end of October 1918, when the Italian army launched the decisive offensive of Vittorio Veneto and non-Austrian troops left their positions following the secessions of their nations from the dual monarchy (Czechs and Slovaks on 28 October, South Slavs on 29 October, Hungary on 31 October). After that Boroeviƒá fell back to Velden, where he sent a telegram to the Emperor offering to march on Vienna to fight the anti-Habsburg revolution in the imperial capital. It is not certain whether the Emperor has been given this message (Boroeviƒá doubted it); the offer was refused on behalf of the Emperor. After the Imperial & Royal Army had been demobilized by the Emperor on 6 November, Boroeviƒá was retired, by the I & R War Ministry in liquidation, by 1 December 1918. =After the war= Tomb of Boroeviƒá at the Zentralfriedhof in Vienna, Austria After the demise and disintegration of Austria-Hungary, Boroeviƒá decided to become a citizen of the newly created Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. He was not welcome despite offering his services to the National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs.Hrvatski biografski leksikon, volume 2, 1989, pp. 168-169 So he stayed in Carinthia, now Austria's southernmost state; his personal belongings, which were on transport in Slovenia, the former Austrian crownland of Carniola, were confiscated there. Boroeviƒá could not understand the mean treatment he had to experience, \\"the only field marshal the Southern Slavs had ever produced\\", as he wrote in his memoirs. Boroeviƒá died in a hospital at Klagenfurt, the capital city of Carinthia. His body was transferred to Vienna where he was entombed at the Central Cemetery (Grave # 62 in the New Arcades to the right of the Church of St. Charles Borromeo). The grave had been paid for by the former emperor Charles, who lived in Switzerland then. He could not take part in the funeral, since he had been banished from Austria for his lifetime by the Habsburg Law since 3 April 1919. Family His father Adam Boroeviƒá was a Grenzer (border guard) officer, his mother was Stana (n√©e Kovarba≈°iƒá von Zbori≈°te). His father took part in wars in Italy, Hungary and Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878. He was awarded silver medal for bravery. As an old man, Boroeviƒá's father had built a Serbian Orthodox church as his endowment in Meƒçenƒçani, which was consecrated in 1877. Boroeviƒá had a brother, Nikola, a colonel who also received Austrian noble status in 1917.: \\"a car i kralj Karlo I austrijsko plemstvo njegovu bratu, pukovniku Nikoli dana 16.III. (3.V.) 1917. god.\\" In 1889, he married Leontina von Rosner, a daughter of a late Austrian colonel, Friedrich Ritter von Rosner. The couple had one son, Friedrich Borojeviƒá von Bojna, named after his mother's father. The son died in 1918. Honors =Honorary degree= In 1916, with the approval of the Emperor Franz Joseph I, on the proposal of the Faculty of Law and the Senate of the University of Zagreb, Svetozar Borojeviƒá and Archduke Eugen were awarded the University's highest honorary degree, Doctor Honoris Causa in the field of social sciences, for their victory over the enemy and especially for the protection of hereditary grudge, and rights and cultural progress of Croats (\\"Ob eximia in limitibus imperii strenue defendendis ac imprimis in Croatum paterno solo iuribus atque litterarum et artium progressu tuendis merita\\"). The award ceremonies were held on 30 January 1916 (for Archduke Eugen) and 1 February 1916 (for Svetozar Borojeviƒá) at the Fifth Army's military apartment, 305 Military Field Post on the Italian front.

He was born in Ruddington, Nottinghamshire, England. His father was a frame work knitter, a trade which Francis took up before joining the army. He was enlisted at Daventry on 5 November 1839 (for a bounty of ¬£3.17s.6d) into the 1st Battalion Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own). Victoria Cross He was awarded his Victoria Cross (VC) for duty in the Crimean War on 12 October 1854. The day before his VC action, another act of gallantry earned him the Distinguished Conduct Medal. The citation for his VC reads: On 12 October 1854 Wheatley and some other Riflemen were occupying a section of the trenches before Sevastopol when a live Russian shell fell amongst the men. Without hesitation Wheatley seized hold of the shell and endeavoured to knock the fuse out with the butt of his rifle. He was unsuccessful at the first attempt and so, with great presence of mind and deliberation he managed somehow to heave it over the parapet of the trench. It had scarcely fallen outside when it exploded. Had it not been for his coolness, presence of mind and supreme courage and discipline, the shell would have inevitably exploded amongst the party causing serious casualties, but instead not a man was hurt. His VC was presented by Queen Victoria in person at the first investiture at Hyde Park, London on 26 June 1857. Death He died on 21 May 1865 at Westminster Hospital, London from acute myelitis (inflammation of the spinal cord) and asphyxia. He was buried in a common grave in Brompton Cemetery, on which a memorial has now been placed. His medals are on view at the Royal Green Jackets (Rifles) Museum and his name is on the memorial in Winchester Cathedral.

History  Former logo Established as The Bytown Packet in 1845 by William Harris, it was renamed the Citizen in 1851. The newspaper's original motto, which has recently been returned to the editorial page, was Fair play and Day-Light. The paper has been through a number of owners. In 1846, Harris sold the paper to John Bell and Henry J. Friel. Robert Bell bought the paper in 1849. In 1877, Charles Herbert Mackintosh, the editor under Robert Bell, became publisher. In 1879, it became one of several papers owned by the Southam family. It remained under Southam until the chain was purchased by Conrad Black's Hollinger Inc.. In 2000, Black sold most of his Canadian holdings, including the flagship National Post to CanWest Global. The editorial view of the Citizen has varied with its ownership, taking a reform, anti-Tory position under Harris and a conservative position under Bell. As part of Southam, it moved to the left, supporting the Liberals largely in opposition to the Progressive Conservative Party's support of free trade in the late 1980s. Under Black, it moved to the right and became a supporter of the Reform Party. In 2002, its publisher Russell Mills was dismissed following the publication of a story critical of Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien and an editorial calling for Chr√©tien's resignation.\\"Fired publisher named Nieman Fellow \\", Harvard Gazette. 2002. It endorsed the Conservative Party of Canada in the 2006 federal election. It published its last Sunday edition on July 15, 2012. The move cut 20 newsroom jobs, and was part of a series of changes made by Postmedia. The logo used to depict the top of the Peace Tower of the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa. In 2014 it was rebranded, with a new logo showing the paper's name over an outline of the Peace Tower on a green background.

Purse, handbag or pouch The term \\"purse\\" originally referred to a small bag for holding coins. In many English-speaking countries it is still used to refer to a small money bag. A \\"handbag\\" is a larger accessory that holds objects beyond currency, such as personal items. American English typically uses the terms purse and handbag interchangeably. The term handbag began appearing in the early 1900s. Initially, it was most often used to refer to men's hand-luggage. Women's bags grew larger and more complex during this period, and the term was attached to the accessory. \\"Pocketbook\\" is another term for a woman's hand bag that was most commonly used on the East Coast of the United States in the mid-twentieth century.  Modern origin  Women's fashion from 1830, including a reticule handbag from France. Early modern Europeans wore purses for one sole purpose: to carry coins. Purses were made of soft fabric or leather and were worn by men as often as ladies; the Scottish sporran is a survival of this custom. In the 17th century, young girls were taught embroidery as a necessary skill for marriage; this also helped them make very beautiful handbags. By the late 18th century, fashions in Europe were moving towards a slender shape for these accessories, inspired by the silhouettes of Ancient Greece and Rome. Women wanted purses that would not be bulky or untidy in appearance, so reticules were designed. Reticules were made of fine fabrics like silk and velvet, carried with wrist straps. First becoming popular in France, they crossed over into Britain, where they became known as \\"indispensables.\\" Men, however, did not adopt the trend. They used purses and pockets, which became popular in men's trousers. The modern purse, clutch, pouch or handbag came about in England during the Industrial Revolution, in part due to the increase in travel by railway. In 1841 the Doncaster industrialist and confectionery entrepreneur Samuel Parkinson (of butterscotch fame) ordered a set of travelling cases and trunks and insisted on a travelling case or bag for his wife's particulars after noticing that her purse was too small and made from material that would not withstand the journey. He stipulated that he wanted various handbags for his wife, varying in size for different occasions and asked that they be made from the same leather that was being used for his cases and trunks to distinguish them from the then-familiar carpetbag and other travellers' cloth bags used by members of the popular classes. H. J. Cave (London) obliged and produced the first modern set of luxury handbags, as we would recognize them today, including a clutch and a tote (named as 'ladies travelling case'). These are now on display in the Museum of Bags and Purses in Amsterdam. H. J. Cave did continue to sell and advertise the handbags, but many critics said that women did not need them and that bags of such size and heavy material would 'break the backs of ladies.' H. J. Cave ceased to promote the bags after 1865, concentrating on trunks instead, although they continued to make the odd handbag for royalty, celebrities or to celebrate special occasions, the Queen's 2012 Diamond Jubilee being the most recent. However, H.J. Cave resumed handbag production in 2010.  20th century  During the 1940s, the rationing of textiles for World War II led to the manufacturing of handbags made in materials like raffia or crocheted from yarn. Some women crocheted their own small handbags from commercial patterns during this period.  Men's bags  A casual messenger bag. The oldest known purse dates back more than 5000 years, and was a pouch worn by a man, √ñtzi the Iceman. Men once carried coin purses. In early Modern Europe, when women's fashions moved in the direction of using small ornamental purses, which evolved into handbags, men's fashions were moving in another direction. Men's trousers replaced men's breeches during the course of the 18th and 19th centuries, and pockets were incorporated in the loose, heavy material. This enabled men to continue carrying coins, and then paper currency, in small leather wallets. Men's pockets were plentiful in 19th century and 20th century trousers and coats, to carry possessions, such as pipes, matches and knives, and they were an item frequently mended by their wives. Men's purses were revived by designers in the 1970s in Europe. Since the 1990s, designers have marketed a more diverse range of accessory bags for men. The names man bag, man-purse and murse have been used. The designs common in the U.S. are typically variations on backpacks or messenger bags, and have either a masculine or a more unisex appearance, although they are often more streamlined than a backpack and less bulky than a briefcase. These bags are often called messenger bags or organizer bags. In many other countries, it is common for men to carry small rectangular shoulder bags, often made of leather. The leather satchel is also common. Men's designer bags are produced by well-known companies such as Prada, Louis Vuitton, Coach, and Bottega Veneta in a variety of shapes and sizes. The global men's bag and small leather goods trade is a $4-billion-a- year industry. Sales of men's accessories including \\"holdall\\" bags are increasing in North America.  Types  An 1875 Chatelaine bag, with a buckram frame and velvet body. It would have been \\"hooked\\" into the waist of the skirt. Crocodile skin handbags in a conservation exhibit at Bristol Zoo, England As a fashion accessory, handbags can be categorized according to the silhouette of the bag, as well as the type of handle. The current popular handbag silhouettes are (as of 2011): * Baguette: a small, narrow, rectangular shape purse, resembling a French loaf of bread (baguette). * Barrel: shaped like a barrel or closed tube, usually with shoulder-length straps. * Bowling bag purse: a popular 1990s \\"retro\\" style for younger women, modelled after American bags used to carry bowling balls. * Bucket bag: a round bag, shaped like a bucket, medium-size or large, with shoulder straps and a drawstring closure. * Clutch: a handbag without handles with detachable chain strap, rectangular in shape, often an evening bag but used during the day as well. * Lucite handbags: Post World War 2, there was an abundance of plastic in the United States. This gave rise to the Lucite Handbag. Each bag was produced off an injection mold and designed in an array of stunning colors and shapes. Llewellyn, and Patricia of Miami were some of the largest producers of these types of bags. * Carpet bag: The Carpet bag, popular in the 1920's-1940's made a resurgence in the 1960's-1970's and was made popular by Mary Poppins. It was typically an oversized tote bag not constructed of carpet, but rather a thicker fabric that resembled carpet which incorporated crushed velvet and a variety of patchwork fabrics. * Doctor's bag: also known as a Gladstone bag, modeled after a Victorian era doctor's bag for making housecalls. * Drawstring: a purse that closes with a drawstring at the top, may have wrist- or shoulder-length straps, popular as an evening bag style. * Half-moon: shaped as a half-moon. * Hobo: medium-size crescent-shaped bag with a top zipper and often a slouch or dip in the centre; a modern, casual silhouette. * Kiondo: a handwoven handbag made from sisal with leather trimmings. It is indigenous to Kenya. * Lighted: a handbag with a lighting system which has been attempted since the 1950s without success until recently when in 2011 the first successful lighted handbag was brought to market. * Messenger bag: one long strap worn across the body, inspired by bags worn by urban messengers to deliver business mail, a modern silhouette. * Minaudi√®re: a small rectangular evening bag, usually hard-bodied, sometimes held inside a soft fabric bag that serves as a sleeve. * Muff: a winter bag made of real or faux fur, wool or velvet that has zippered compartments and a slip opening for hands. * Pocketbook: small purse, rectangular shape. * Pouch: small bag such as a pocket, teabag, money bag, sporran, etc. * Reticule: also known as a ridicule or indispensable, was a type of small drawstring handbag or purse, similar to a modern evening bag, used mainly from 1795 to 1820. * Saddlebag: shaped like a horse saddle, may have equestrian motifs and hardware to emphasize the design. * Satchel: a soft-sided case usually of leather. * Tote bag: medium to large bag with two straps and an open top. * Trapezoid: shaped as a trapezoid, usually made of stiff material. * Wristlet: a small handbag with a short carrying strap resembling a bracelet. According to type of handle, handbags are often categorized as: * Tote bag: a medium to large bag with two straps and an open top. * Cross-body bag: one long strap that crosses over the body, with the bag resting at the front by the waist. * Sling bag: one long, wide strap that crosses over the body, with the bag resting on the back. * Shoulder bag: any bag with shoulder-length straps. * Clutch: handleless.

Hardware  1860 Woman's handbag with frame and kissing lock (LACMA). A distinction can also be made between soft-body handbags or frame handbags, where a metal frame supports the textile or leather of the bag. Frame bags often use a kissing lock closure, with two interlocking metal beads set on the top of the frame. Kissing locks were popular on handbags during the early- to mid-20th century, and remain popular with vintage collectors and in \\"retro\\" designs. These locks are still seen on smaller coin purses.  Coinage as a verb  The verb \\"to handbag\\" and its humorous usage was inspired in the 1980s by UK prime minister Margaret Thatcher having ‚Äúweaponized‚Äù the handbag in the opinion of British biographer and historian David Cannadine. As ‚Äúher most visible symbol of her power to command‚Äù the bag became an emphatic prop that she produced at meetings to show she meant business. She would invariably bring out of the bag a crucial document from which she would quote, her speech notes often being cut to size to fit inside. Because Thatcher was Britain‚Äôs first female prime minister, former Daily Telegraph editor Charles Moore wrote in his authorised biography of 2013, ‚Äúher handbag became the sceptre of her rule‚Äù.Charles Moore (2013). Margaret Thatcher: The Authorized Biography, Volume One: Not For Turning. Allen Lane: London. . The verb's more general meaning of \\"treating ruthlessly\\" came to symbolize Thatcher's whole style of government. Victims of her handbaggings, from political leaders to journalists, have testified to what the German chancellor Helmut Kohl perceived as her ‚Äúice-cold pursuit of her interests‚Äù. US secretary of state James Baker recalled her standby ploy: ‚ÄúWhen negotiations stall, get out the handbag! The solution is always there.‚Äù Julian Critchley, one of her biggest Tory backbench critics, once said, \\"Margaret Thatcher and her handbag is the same as Winston Churchill and his cigar.\\" Thatcher's bag was almost as newsworthy an item as she was herself and on the day she died, one of her handbag-makers saw a sharp rise in sales of her favorite structured design. The original bag Thatcher asserts on a signed card was the one ‚Äúused every day in my time at Downing Street‚Äù is archived at Churchill College, Cambridge. Made of dark blue leather ‚Äúin mock-croc style‚Äù, it was a gift from friends on her birthday in 1984.

He was the inventor of radiosurgery. Life and career Lars Leksell was born in F√§ssberg Parish, Sweden on November 23, 1907. He completed medical studies at the Karolinska Institute and began his neurosurgical training in 1935 under Herbert Olivercrona. Development of electronystagmography and his thesis on muscular control and gamma motor neurons were his early scientific achievements.Leksell L., The action potential and excitatory effects of the small ventral root fibres to skeletal muscle, Acta Physiol Scand 1945, pp. 1-79. In 1949, he developed his arc centered stereotactic frame based on A polar coordinate system. In 1951, using the Uppsala University cyclotron, Leksell and the physicist and radiobiologist Borje Larsson, developed the concept of radiosurgery. Leksell and Larsson first employed proton beams coming from several directions into a small area into the brain,Leksell L., The stereotaxic method and radiosurgery of the brain, Acta Chir. Scand. 1951, pp.316-9. in experiments in animals and in the first treatments of human patients. Thus, he achieved a new non-invasive method of destroying discrete anatomical regions within the brain while minimizing the effect on the surrounding tissues. He became a professor of surgery at University of Lund in 1958. From 1960 until his retirement, in 1974, he was Professor & Chairman of neurosurgery at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, succeeding Herbert Olivecrona, who was the department's founder in 1920.http://www.radiosurgeryconnect.com/lars_leksell.html During this time Leksell pursued his work on stereotactic radiosurgery and refinement of stereotactic methods.Leksell L., A stereotaxic apparatus for intracerebral surgery, Acta. Chir. Scand. 1949, pp.229-33. The first prototype of the gamma knife was installed in Sophiahemmet in 1968. Over the rest of his career, Leksell treated 762 patients with it. Throughout this time he would propose improving radiosurgery with modern imaging modalities including CT, MRI and angiography, as is currently used. Today, Leksell's technique is used as an effective treatment for many conditions such as arteriovenous malformations, pituitary tumors, acoustic neuromas, craniopharyngiomas, meningioma, metastatic and skull base tumors, and primary brain tumors. The device is manufactured by Elekta Instruments, Inc., a Swedish company which manufactures stereotactic surgery and radiosurgery equipment, based on the inventions of Leksell. It was founded by him in 1972. He died peacefully at age of 78 in 1986 while taking a brisk walk in Swiss alps. First years and the \\"stereotactic frame\\" Leksell started his neurosurgical training with Herbert Olivecrona in 1935 at the Serafimer Hospital, one of the oldest hospitals in Sweden founded in 1752. The Olivecrona neurosurgical service enjoyed a solid international reputation and attracted a large number of trainees from all over the world. For a short period Leksell served as a volunteer medical doctor in Finland when it was attacked by the Soviet Union in November 1939. Later he told that during that war, he often speculated on the possibility of extracting bullets from the brain with minimal damage to the surrounding brain tissue using a mechanically guided instrument.Lozano, A. et al.,Textbook of Stereotactic, Funct. Neurosurgery, Berlin 2009, p.64. In the early 1940s Leksell joined Ragnar Granit, Nobel Laureate 1967, for experimental studies in neurophysiology. In 1945 he presented a PhD dissertation, a monograph on the motor gamma system titled ‚Äò‚ÄòThe action potential and excitatory effects of the small ventral root fibers to skeletal muscle.‚Äô‚ÄôLozano, A. et al.,Textbook of Stereotactic, Funct. Neurosurgery, Berlin 2009, p.64. This was a major milestone in the understanding of muscle control and has now become part of basic neurophysiology. During these years he, together with Granit and Skoglund, made another major contribution by describing the phenomenon of ephapsis, ‚Äò‚Äòartificial synapses,‚Äô‚Äô caused by local pressure on a nerve, as a possible mechanism involved in trigeminal neuralgia. After resuming clinical work, he started work on the development of a stereotactic instrument. The stereotactic method is the product of Robert Clarke, an engineer, physiologist and surgeon, who, together with neurosurgeon Victor Horsley, devised an instrument for simulating and making lesions at exact locations within the brains of experimental animals: the Horsley‚ÄìClarke apparatus. Clarke came up with the concept in 1895, and the original device was constructed in 1905 and first used in 1906. The first successful cranial application of stereotactic surgery in humans is credited to the team of Ernest Spiegel and Henry Wycis in the Department of Experimental Neurology at Temple University in Philadelphia (Spiegel et al. 1947). Their original frame, using a Cartesian coordinate systems and similar in design and operation to the Clarke-Horsley device, was fixed to a patient‚Äôs head by means of a plaster cast. The frame and cast were removable, allowing separate imaging and surgery sessions. Contrast radiography, ventriculography and later pneumoencephalography permitted the visualization of intracranial reference points from which the location of target structures of interest could be determined. Initial applications were for psychosurgery.Timothy D. Solberg, Robert L. Siddon, and Brian Kavanagh,Historical Development of Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy, Springer, Berlin 2012, p.13. In 1947 Leksell visited Wycis in Philadelphia and then developed and described his instrument in a publication in 1949. This was the first example of a stereotactic system based on the principle of ‚Äò‚Äòcenter- of-arc‚Äô‚Äô.Lozano, A. et al.,Textbook of Stereotactic, Funct. Neurosurgery, Berlin 2009, p.65. In contrast to the Cartesian coordinate system of the Spiegel-Wycis device, Leksell‚Äôs frame utilized three polar coordinates (angle, depth and anterior‚Äìposterior location). This ‚Äò‚Äòarc-quadrant‚Äô‚Äô device provided maximum flexibility in choosing probe entry point and trajectory, and was therefore much easier to use. The frame has been modified over the ensuing years, but remains remarkably similar in function and appearance to the original 1949 device.Timothy D. Solberg, Robert L. Siddon, and Brian Kavanagh,Historical Development of Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy, Springer, Berlin 2012, pp.14-15. The use of a movable semi-arc with an electrode carrier implies that the tip of a probe can reach the target regardless of the position of the carrier or the angling of the arc relative to the skull fixation device, a frame or base plate with bars for bone fixation screws. This construction permits also transphenoidal, straight lateral and suboccipital probe approaches. Leksell was in many respects a perfectionist and for the rest of his life he continued to change and revise the design of virtually every small part of his instrument though the basic semicircular frame was retained. He focused not only on upgrading the function of the instrument but also on its aesthetic appearance. An important feature was that ‚Äò‚Äòthe apparatus should be easy to handle and practical in routine clinical work‚Äô‚Äô and ‚Äò‚Äòa high degree of exactitude is necessary.‚Äô‚Äô An oft-cited quotation is ‚Äò‚ÄòTools used by the surgeon must be adapted to the task and where the human brain is concerned, no tool can be too refined.‚Äô‚ÄôLozano, A. et al.,Textbook of Stereotactic, Funct. Neurosurgery, Berlin 2009, p.66 The first, documented clinical application of Leksell‚Äôs stereotactic system was a case of a craniopharyngioma cyst that was punctured and treated with injection of radioactive phosphorus. that patient was probably the first patient in the world to undergo this form of therapy (1948). Before the advent of modern imaging techniques (CT, MRI), ventriculography was, and in some centers still is, routinely utilized for target coordinate determination. Already in the late 1940s neuroradiology was a well-developed speciality at the Serafimer Hospital and angiography and pneumoencephalography were routinely practiced. Leksell performed pneumoencephalography, first in the sitting and then in the supine position to visualize the anterior and posterior commissures, respectively. In order to compensate for the divergence of the X-rays, he constructed a diagram of tightly packed concentric circles, approximated to spirals, geometrically related to the divergence and the distance between the X-ray tube and the film, and frame planes, for determining the target coordinates; it has to be admitted, however, that in contrast to Leksell‚Äôs other inventions many surgeons found it difficult to understand and use this diagram.Lozano, A. et al.,Textbook of Stereotactic, Funct. Neurosurgery, Berlin 2009, p.66. Beside the passionate interest in the technical aspects of stereotaxy, Leksell was in the 1950s and 1960s very active in the operation theatre. He performed a large number of pallidotomies, and later also thalamotomies, in Parkinson's disease and capsulotomies in various forms of mental disorders. The results of a series of 81 patients subjected to pallidotomy was published in 1960, and 116 patients treated with capsulotomy were reported in 1961.Lozano, A. et al.,Textbook of Stereotactic, Funct. Neurosurgery, Berlin 2009, p.67. Radiosurgery The term and concept of radiosurgery were introduced by Leksell already in 1951 when he reasoned that the ‚Äò‚Äòcenter-of-arc‚Äô‚Äô principle and his first stereotactic instrument were suitable for replacing a probe (needle electrode) by cross-firing intracerebral structures with narrow beams of radiant energy. X-rays were first tried but both gamma rays and ultrasonics were included as alternatives.Lozano, A. et al.,Textbook of Stereotactic, Funct. Neurosurgery, Berlin 2009, p.67. Initial experiments were performed on cats and then a few patients with pain and chronic psychosis were treated with a 280 kV X-ray tube attached to the arc. Of particular interest is that in 1953 two cases of trigeminal neuralgia were treated and at follow up in 1971 they were still free of pain.Lozano, A. et al.,Textbook of Stereotactic, Funct. Neurosurgery, Berlin 2009, p.67. In 1946 Leksell was appointed head of a neurosurgical unit in Lund in southern Sweden where he became professor in 1958 and remained so until 1960. In those days there were very few neurosurgeons around the world who were active in stereotactic surgery and the international network was very small; it is of interest that the Schalten brand and Bailey's Stereotactic Atlas was partly based on some brain specimens supplied by Leksell. While in Lund, Leksell was apparently able to evade many of his clinical obligations because he was able to initiate a close collaboration with a team of physicists led by Borje Larsson at the University of Uppsala (north of Stockholm) where a synchrocyclotron was available. They conducted experiments with stereotactic high-energy proton irradiation in goats resulting in a seminal publication in Nature in 1958. This technique was also applied in a few patients with Parkinson's disease (pallidotomy), psychiatric disorder (capsulotomy) and pain (mesencephalotomy).Lozano, A. et al.,Textbook of Stereotactic, Funct. Neurosurgery, Berlin 2009, p.67. Although precisely placed and well-limited lesions could be produced by the focused proton beams, as demonstrated in a few autopsy cases, the synchrocyclotron proved to be too complicated for general clinical use. This compelled Leksell to consider other radiation sources and he started designing the cobalt-60 gamma unit, which was fully integrated with the stereotactic system. The development of the ‚Äò‚Äòbeam- knife‚Äô‚Äô took place after Leksell had been appointed successor to Olivecrona in 1960 and the first unit was inaugurated in 1967. Later the same year reports of the two first cases, patients with cancer related pain subjected to radiosurgical thalamotomy, were published.Lozano, A. et al.,Textbook of Stereotactic, Funct. Neurosurgery, Berlin 2009, pp.67-68. Originally, radiosurgery and the gamma unit were developed with the hope that it would offer a bloodless, and less risky, method to be applied principally in functional neurosurgery, for example in thalamotomy for Parkinson's disease. On the other hand, Leksell had always considered his sterotactic instrument a surgical tool that should also be utilized in general neurosurgery in order to enhance precision and minimize hazards.Lozano, A. et al.,Textbook of Stereotactic, Funct. Neurosurgery, Berlin 2009, pp.68-69 This idea had to some extent been realized by the extensive use of stereotactic technique in puncturing cysts and also in performing biopsies in critical regions. The gamma unit soon proved to be useful in the treatment of some diseases previously requiring neurosurgery, such as pituitary adenomas, acoustic neurinomas and arteriovenous malformations. This use of radiosurgery has revolutionized the management of these conditions but was met with skepticism from the neurosurgical community.Lozano, A. et al.,Textbook of Stereotactic, Funct. Neurosurgery, Berlin 2009, p.69 Two other examples of Leksell's innovation deserve to be mentioned. He was the first to apply ultrasound in neurosurgical diagnosis by the development of echoencephalography as early as 1955. Moreover, his double action rongeur has become an indispensable tool in the hands of most neurosurgeons.Lozano, A. et al.,Textbook of Stereotactic, Funct.

There is exactly one zero matrix of any given dimension m√ón (with entries from a given ring), so when the context is clear, one often refers to the zero matrix. In general, the zero element of a ring is unique, and is typically denoted by 0 without any subscript indicating the parent ring. Hence the examples above represent zero matrices over any ring. The zero matrix also represents the linear transformation which sends all the vectors to the zero vector. It is idempotent, meaning that when it is multiplied by itself, the result is itself. The zero matrix is the only matrix whose rank is 0. Occurrences The mortal matrix problem is the problem of determining, given a finite set of n √ó n matrices with integer entries, whether they can be multiplied in some order, possibly with repetition, to yield the zero matrix. This is known to be undecidable for a set of six or more 3 √ó 3 matrices, or a set of two 15 √ó 15 matrices. In ordinary least squares regression, if there is a perfect fit to the data, the annihilator matrix is the zero matrix.

The hours are 10 am to 6 pm in summer and 10 am to 4 pm in winter. The garden can be visited separately from the abbey and no charge is made to visit the garden alone. While visiting College Garden, it is also possible to visit the Little Cloister Garden, a small garden with a fountain in the cloisters, and St Catherine's Garden which is in the ruins of the old monastic infirmary. Probably the best time to visit the gardens is in the spring. A thousand years ago, this was the infirmary garden of the monastery, then on Thorney Island, and it is claimed to be the oldest garden in England under continuous cultivation. While the main function of the College Garden is no longer to feed hungry monks, the area still retains an atmosphere of calm, despite being situated in such a busy area. Remembering the Herbarium that the monks created here, a new herb garden was created in 2010. Its current name refers to the Collegiate Church of St. Peter, Westminster Abbey, rather than to its component Westminster School of which Lord Burlington's College Dormitory building forms the west side. The north side is formed by the great hall of Westminster School (originally the monks' dormitory), and the houses of the abbey canons; the east and south sides are a medieval wall with a watergate which formerly opened into the River Thames, now embanked fifty yards away beyond the House of Lords.

Elmo Lincoln, the first actor in the role, had made two Tarzan movies when Numa Pictures approached him about making a third. At the time, Lincoln was not interested (though he would later return to the role briefly). One of the Weiss Brothers, the low-budget filmmakers who controlled Numa, was on a visit to New York when he signed Pohler to play the apeman. Pohler was given the screen name Gene Pollar. The film was called The Return of Tarzan, based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel The Return of Tarzan. Production Pollar was paid $100 per week. The production was sold to Goldwyn Distribution Corporation in April 1920. As a precautionary measure, since it featured a new star, the film was retitled The Revenge of Tarzan just two weeks prior to its opening on July 20, 1920. The film was a success, but Numa refused to release Pollar to accept a contract from Universal Pictures. Later life The disgruntled Pollar ended his acting career and returned to firefighting under his original name, Joseph C. Pohler. In 1944, he became a purchasing agent for a retail store chain, for which he worked until his retirement to West Hollywood, Florida. Pollar emerged briefly from obscurity in 1966 at age 73. That year, a publicity event surrounding the premiere of NBC's Tarzan series brought together several actors who had played the apeman, and the guest of honor was James H. Pierce, then 66, who was dubbed the \\"oldest living Tarzan\\". Pollar contacted the media and declared correctly that he was the oldest. \\"Pierce is just a kid compared to me\\", he joked. Pollar blamed the mix-up on a New York City paper's erroneous report of his death a few years earlier. Pollar died in 1971 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, at age 79.

The series is based on the Arabian Nights, a classic work of Middle Eastern literature. The cast includes Henry Corden, Paul Frees, Frank Gerstle, Shari Lewis, Jay North and John Stephenson. Plot: Secret origins Once a peaceful country, Persia was overrun by the powerful forces of the evil conqueror Bakaar the Black Sultan. When all the states of Persia were overthrown, Bakaar invaded the capital city of Baghdad. Bakaar and his forces breached the royal palace and forcibly claimed the throne from Prince Turhan and ordered the prince to be killed. Prince Turhan fled the palace, pursued by the guards of Bakaar. In his escape, the prince is helped by a magician named Fariik who with his magic slipped away from the guards. On their way to the state of El-Rabaul to seek aid from his uncle the Caliph, Turhan and Fariik meet Raseem while being chased by the guards in the Caves of Doom. Raseem tells them that Bakaar's forces have already usurped the throne of El-Rabaul and imprisoned the Caliph and his daughter Princess Nida. The trio then heads to El-Rabaul on Raseem's donkey Zazuum. In El-Rabaul, they rescue Princess Nida who is about to be sold into slavery. There, Princess Nida demonstrates her mastery of disguise and voice mimicry by tricking the guards, but they soon find themselves cornered by Bakaar's men. There Bez jumps into the scene, shapeshifts into an elephant, charges through the guards, and carries everyone to safety. In the Caves of Doom, they decide to form a heroic band and swear to protect their land from the tyranny of Bakaar, thus forming an alliance called the Arabian Knights. Series direction Arabian Knights was one of several animated miniseries used as filler segments for Hanna-Barbera's Banana Splits Adventure Hour show. Each episode ran between 9 and 10 minutes in length. For the most part, it competed with the other series, namely the animated The Three Musketeers, the part live action, part animated Micro Ventures, and the live action Danger Island segments. Often, the general thrust of the Arabian Knights adventures deals with the Knights trying to effect some action against Bakaar‚Äôs soldiers, finding a means to further complete their goal of turning the tables on the evil dictator, or dealing with another villain set within the Knights' universe. For the most part, these adventures were done with a semi-serious slant, with a goodly portion of action and comedy mixed in. Hardly anyone was injured or harmed‚Äîsave for Bakaar's minions (with a usually comic effect), and the episodes usually had an upbeat, happy ending for the Knights. Characters =The Arabian Knights= * Prince Turhan (voiced by Jay North) - The prince of Baghdad and rightful heir to the throne of the Sultan, Turhan is a young and handsome teenage boy. Apart from being brave and bold, he is an agile acrobat, an athlete, and a master swordsman. Turhan gathers a small group of friends to lead a revolt against the tyranny of Bakaar and reclaim his throne to restore the peace and prosperity in his state. Turhan is the de facto leader of the Knights and the driving force behind fighting Bakaar and ending the usurper‚Äôs reign. He owns a magic scimitar that can be thrown and returns like a boomerang, in unique ways. * Princess Nida (voiced by Shari Lewis) - Daughter of the Caliph of El-Rabaul, Princess Nida is a lovely teenage girl who is the cousin of Prince Turhan. She is a master of disguise and an expert of voice mimicry. Nida is also skilled in martial arts and can hold her own in the Knights' battles. * Fariik the Magician (voiced by John Stephenson) - A short, tubby, jolly little man, Fariik is a skilled practitioner and spell- master of the mystical arts who lends a magical hand when needed. To cast his spell, Fariik would quote \\"Rosan Kobar.\\" He is the first to have offered aid to Turhan after Prince Turhan is deposed by Bakaar. Sometimes, the magic gets very difficult and can take a lot of energy out of him. Fariik can animate carpets and pillows for the occasional airborne transport of the team. Fariik can render himself and others invisible for stealth or camouflage purposes. At times, he can dissolve himself and others into smoke to make an escape from narrow places. He can levitate objects, alter the size of things and persons, create things out of thin air, and alter the form of one thing into another. * Raseem the Strong (voiced by Frank Gerstle) - A tall muscular man with brief costume and fez, Raseem is the powerhouse of the team with incredible physical strength, endurance, and stamina. He first met Turhan and Fariik when they hid in the Caves of Doom that he occupies. Raseem mistakes them for Bakaar's men and attacks them. However, upon learning they are against Bakaar, he befriends them, and he goes with them to find the Caliph (to get his aid against Bakaar). He often boasts of his strength, saying he is as strong as 30 men. At one time, Raseem said he was as strong as seven elephants. Strong enough to shatter stone walls, lift and catch boulders, catch and throw back cannonballs, and fight off scores of Bakaar‚Äôs soldiers at a time, Raseem's power makes for a good equalizer in the Knights' battles. * Zazuum (voiced by Don Messick) - Raseem‚Äôs faithful little donkey with long ears, Zazuum was first used by Turhan, Fariik, and Raheem to get to El-Rabaul. Zazuum is quite an intelligent donkey as he aids his fellow team members. Zazuum can spin himself so fast he becomes like a destructive miniature tornado that can defeat any enemy or destroy anything coming his way. He does not like his tail to be pulled, as it enrages him to the point of being a berserk loose cannon that can shatter rocks into pebbles. In addition, Zazuum can smell gold very precisely. * Bez the Beast (voiced by Henry Corden) - A dark-skinned man with a turban and green clothing, Bez can shapeshift into an animal, bird, or aquatic creature from a mighty elephant to a tiny mouse. Often, he triggers this ability by speaking the phrase ‚ÄúSize of a ‚Äî!‚Äù and naming the animal or bird he wishes to turn into, followed by a loud boom that proclaims his transformation. Sometimes the magical phrase is followed by clapping his hands together. If the creature is small enough, Bez can turn into many versions of it such as turning into a million bees. Bez is known to turn into some larger animals which often serve as alternate modes of transportation for the Arabian Knights like an elephant or a camel for land transportation. He can also transform into mythical creatures like a winged stallion or a roc for the occasional airborne transportation. His shapeshifting makes him a handy spy for the Knights in order to find out what Bakaar is planning. =Villains= * Bakaar the Black Sultan (voiced by John Stephenson) - The corrupt conqueror and nemesis of the Arabian Knights, Bakaar usurps the throne of Turhan‚Äôs father and takes control of Baghdad. Clearly wishing to command all of the kingdoms that bow to Baghdad, he sets all of his forces to the goal of capturing Turhan (and later all of the Knights) to secure his place on the throne. While cruel, Bakaar does not usually involve himself directly in the fight against the Knights. He prefers to let his soldiers and minions to do the job. Bakaar's distinctive manner of dress‚Äîa single-spiked, fur-lined helmet in place of a crown‚Äîhints at ancestry from the Mongols. ** Vangore (voiced by Paul Frees) - Bakaar's enforcer and captain of his guards. Often hatches plots to capture the Knights. Apparently, Vangore's father was a camel driver. He has red hair shaved to a topknot (which would historically be an indication of Galatian ancestry and of being enslaved). ** Sundar - Bakaar's court magician.
