It was fought between the Sardinian army ‚Äì acting as the driving force in the war for Italian unification, against the Papal States. On 7 September, Cavour, Prime Minister of Piedmont, sent an ultimatum to the Pope demanding that he dismiss his foreign troops. When he failed to do this, 35,000 troops crossed the border on 11 September, with General Cialdini advancing along the Adriatic coast and General Della Rocca leading another troop across Umbria. Papal troops were caught by surprise and thrown into confusion. Some of the Papal troops surrendered the same day and some retreated to Ancona which fell on after a short siege. As a result of this battle, the Marches and Umbria entered in the Kingdom of Italy and the extent of the Papal States was reduced to the area of what is today known as Lazio. The battle is remembered for being bloody, and for the highly disparate numbers of troops‚Äîless than 10,000 papal soldiers to 39,000 Sardinians. The papal army was composed of volunteers from many European countries, amongst whom the French and Belgian nationals constituted a Franco-Belgian battalion. Among the French volunteers were a notable number of nobles from western France: after the battle, whilst consulting the list of dead and wounded members of the papal army, the Sardinian general Cialdini is reported to have said, in an example of rather black humor, \\"you would think this was a list of invites for a ball given by Louis XIV!\\"Marquis de S√©gur. 1891.

In 1950 he began working for The Providence Journal and Evening Bulletin first as a copy boy, and then as a reporter, managing editor, and publisher.  The Question  On November 17, 1973, at the annual Associated Press Managing Editors convention in Orlando, Florida, Ungaro asked Nixon about his reported underpayment of income taxes in 1970 and 1971. Nixon‚Äôs famous declaration came after he answered a subsequent question about the Watergate scandal, posed by then president of the association Dick Smyser of Oak Ridge, Tennessee's The Oak Ridger. At the end of that reply, Nixon doubled back to Ungaro‚Äôs question, saying: \\"I welcome this kind of examination because people have got to know whether or not their president is a crook. Well, I‚Äôm not a crook.\\" Nixon later agreed to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes.  Later career  Ungaro left the Evening Bulletin later that year and began working at Gannett Company's Westchester Rockland Newspapers in 1974 as managing editor.

Published December 26, 1930. He accumulated a dominant overall record of 254‚Äì95 (.728) over twenty-four seasons as the UVA head coach. During his tenure he also made the Cavalier track program nationally known while simultaneously starting the school's college basketball and college boxing programs. He came to Virginia after serving fourteen years as the Athletics Director of Cornell University. Lannigan's ability was highly renowned throughout the eastern seaboard and southern United States, and his services were in high demand at many leading universities of both regions. Lannigan, however, remained loyal to the University of Virginia until he was forced into retirement by a severe illness to which he succumbed after several months. Coaching Lannigan was a renowned college basketball coach in the early years of the sport. His team achieved a perfect record of 17‚Äì0 in the 1914-15 season, and posted an undefeated conference record in the old Southern Conference's inaugural year of 1921-22. In the 1924-25 season, his team nearly doubled up the University of Kentucky basketball team's score, 29‚Äì16, after being invited to play against the Wildcats in their brand new Alumni Gymnasium. It was one of only 24 times the Kentucky team lost in that gym through the next 26 years. Yet his Cavaliers defeated Kentucky again, 31‚Äì28, when they returned the favor to visit Memorial Gymnasium in 1928. Lannigan earlier coached \\"the Arkansas Flash,\\" James Rector, in track and field events. While still a UVA student, Rector fell just six inches short of winning the 100 meter dash of the 1908 Olympic Games in London, England. Rector was also a Virginia star on its college football and college baseball teams. Death Lannigan's gravestone at the University of Virginia Cemetery in Charlottesville, Virginia. Lannigan fell ill at the age of 65 and immediately retired from coaching. For many months he then underwent treatment at the United States Naval Hospital in Portsmouth, Virginia. For the last two months of his life he had returned to his home in Charlottesville and for his last week the University of Virginia Hospital. His funeral was held at St. Paul's Episcopal Church across the street from The Rotunda. Lannigan is buried in the University of Virginia Cemetery and Columbarium. The current venue used by the Cavalier track and field teams, Lannigan Field, is named in his honor. Personal life Lannigan married Ms. Helen White of Bakersfield, Vermont. He left behind two daughters, one who worked at the University of Virginia and one who lived in New York City. Henry was also survived by one son Raymond Angus Lannigan I from his first wife Sarah Dutton Lannigan. He was also survived by four brothers and a sister.

In 2012 he was awarded with the Gold Kondratieff Medal by the International N. D. Kondratieff Foundation. Major contributions Leonid Grinin's current research interests include Big History and macro-evolution, globalization studies, economic cycles, the long-term trends in the cultural evolution and evolution of technologies, periodization of history, political anthropology and long-term development of the political systems, world-systems studies. =Periodization of history= Grinin suggests a four-staged periodization of historical process. The transition from one stage to another is the change of all basic characteristics of the respective stage. As the starting point of such a change Grinin proposes the production principle that describes the major qualitative stages of the development of the world productive forces. Grinin singles out four principles of production: Hunter- gatherer; Craft-Agrarian; Industrial; and Information-Scientific. To clear up the chronology of the beginning of each respective stage he proposes the three production revolutions: the Agrarian or Neolithic Revolution; the Industrial Revolution, and the Information-Scientific RevolutionGrinin L. Production Revolutions and Periodization of History: A Comparative and Theoretic- mathematical Approach. Social Evolution & History. Vol. 6, num, 2, 2007. =Future technological development= Leonid Grinin connects major technological achievements with the Cybernetic revolution. He thinks that the technologies will develop in the direction of self-regulating systems which will penetrate many spheres starting from medicine to food production. With respect to possible dramatic changes of the human organism he argues that they may rise unprecedented ethical issues and seriously damage many vital aspects of our life including family relations, gender, and morals.Grinin, Leonid; Grinin, Anton L. Global Technological Perspectives in the Light of Cybernetic Revolution and Theory of Long Cycles. Journal of Globalization Studies. Volume 6, Number 2 / November 2015. =Development of political systems= Grinin insists that the two-stage scheme of the state macroevolution (Early State ‚Äì Mature State) proposed by Henri Claessen and Peter Skalnik is not sufficient, and suggests that it should be modified as \\"Early State ‚Äì Developed State ‚Äì Mature State\\", emphasizing that the differences between developed and early states are no less pronounced than the ones between the former and the mature states.Grinin L. Early State, Developed State, Mature State: The Statehood Evolutionary Sequence. Social Evolution & History. Vol. 7, num. 1, 2008, pp. 67-81 =Globalization and sovereignty= In the world political science the subject of change, ‚Äòdiffusion‚Äô, or ‚Äòdisappearing‚Äô of national sovereignty is widely debated. Grinin argues that on the whole globalization contributes to the change and reduction of state sovereign powers, and he investigates the reasons and consequences of the deliberate voluntary reduction of sovereign prerogatives as most states voluntarily and deliberately limit the scope of their sovereignty.Grinin L. Globalization and Sovereignty: Why do States Abandon their Sovereign Prerogatives? Age of Globalization. Number 1, 2008 =People of celebrity= Grinin also investigates the influence of the personal celebrity factor on the social life of modern society, analyses celebrities as a special stratum and reasons for the rapid increase in the importance of social role of personal celebrity. He argues that personal celebrity is to be added to the list of those features that determine the major forms of inequality and by analogy with Peter L. Berger's 'knowledge class people' suggests defining the stratum of people whose occupation is connected with celebrity and whose major capital is celebrity with the notion ‚Äòpeople of celebrity‚Äô.Grinin L. ‚ÄòPeople of celebrity‚Äô as a new social stratum and elite.

Social Macroevolution: Growth of the World System Integrity and a System of Phase Transitions. World Futures, Volume 65, Issue 7 October 2009 , pages 477‚Äì506. =Great Divergence and Great Convergence= Together with Andrey Korotayev he has also made a significant contribution to the current Great Divergence debate.Great Divergence and Great Convergence. A Global Perspective (Springer, 2015, with Andrey Korotayev). As is noted by Jack Goldstone, the \\"new view, carefully presented and rigorously modeled by Grinin and Korotayev, provides a richer and more nuanced version of the ‚ÄúGreat Divergence,‚Äù bridging many of the differences between the traditional and California viewpoints. Yet they go further. Amazingly, by building a model utilizing human capital (education), global population growth, and regional productivity, they show how both the Great Divergence and the recent ‚ÄúGreat Convergence‚Äù (the economic catching up of developing countries) are phases of the same process of global modernization.\\" Goldstone, Jack A. \\"Great Divergence and Great Convergence in a Global Perspective.\\" Social Evolution & History 15.2 (2016): 197-198.

He has played 49 games for various Danish youth team selections, including nine matches for the Denmark national under-21 football team. Career =Club= Nielsen began his career in the youth ranks of small Danish clubs Hjorten IF and Herlev IF, before joining the youth ranks of Akademisk Boldklub (AB) in the second-tier Danish 1st Division. He played 28 first team games and scored two goals as a semi-professional for AB. He was sold to 1st Division rivals Vejle Boldklub in September 2005, signing a full-time professional contract, and debuted in a 3-0 victory over former club AB on September 19. In his first season with Vejle, he helped the club win the 2005-06 1st Division to gain promotion for the Danish Superliga championship. He played 23 of 33 games and scored one goal during the 2006‚Äì07 Superliga season, as the club were relegated to the 1st Division. Nielsen stayed with Vejle, and helped the team win the 2007-08 1st Division. He played 28 games and scored five goals in the 2008‚Äì09 Superliga, but could not keep the club from being relegated once more. In his time with Vejle, Nielsen appeared in 99 official matches scoring 20 goals. With his contract expiring in December 2010, he was linked with the Danish clubs OB, FC Copenhagen and FC Midtjylland in November 2009. On 1 December 2009, it was announced that he was trialing with Schalke 04. Schalke manager Felix Magath said he could clearly see some perspective in the young winger, but an injury caused him to return to Denmark after a single training session. On April 14, 2010, Nielsen was loaned out to US club New York Red Bulls. The deal was a cooperation between New York Red Bulls and Austrian club Red Bull Salzburg, with Nielsen scheduled to ultimately join Red Bull Salzburg on 1 January 2011, according to Salzburg official Christoph Freund. As the Austrian transfer window was already closed, a direct buy was not possible for Salzburg, with Nielsen instead moving to New York Red Bulls as the US transfer window was open until April 15. Salzburg purchased Nielsen in 2010-11 and loaned him back to New York for the 2011 MLS season. Having waited for the approval of his U.S. visa application, he was seen to make an instant impact by head coach Hans Backe.http://www.newyorkredbulls.com/news/2010/04/backe- nielsen-expected-rodgers-delayed However, injuries limited Nielsen as he only appeared in two league matches for New York in 2010. Despite his injury setbacks it was decided that Nielsen would remain in New York for the 2011 season. His injuries continued throughout the entire 2011 MLS season. Nielsen's contract with Red Bull Salzburg - and his associated loan to New York Red Bulls - expired on 31 December 2011.http://www.tipsbladet.dk/nyhed/generelle/ny-red-bulls-usikre-paa-brian- nielsen He trained with the club as a trialist during 2012 pre-season camp but was not offered a contract. =International= Nielsen has represented Denmark at every youth level from the Under-16 to the Under-21 side.

A typical joint audit has audit planning performed jointly and fieldwork allocated to the auditors. The auditors are typically not individuals, but auditing firms. This work allocation may be rotated after a set number of years to mitigate the risk of over-familiarity. Work performed by each auditor is reviewed by the other, in most cases by exchanging audit summary reports. The critical issues at group level, including group consolidation, are reviewed jointly and there is joint reporting to the legal entity's management, its audit committee, a government entity, or the general public. A joint audit is different from a dual audit, where a dual audit is performed by two independent auditors issuing their own separate reports, which are then used by another auditor that ultimately reports on the entity as a whole. Since the audit reform in 2014 in Europe, joint auditing is encouraged but not obligated by the law. In combination with mandatory rotation it's effective to diversify the audit market. In France the joint audit system is obligated by law for PIE's. Uses Joint audits are used internationally, including in India, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland and the UK. In France, joint audit became a legal requirement in 1966, while in South Africa, a joint audit is mandatory for firms operating in the financial services sector. In the United States, a joint audits are performed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by using various specialists and agents simultaneously in a single tax audit.Internal Revenue Service Joint Audit Planning, 17 September 2003. Accessed 4 April 2007. The state of Maryland has a joint audit committee, composed of members of the State House of Representatives and State Senate, responsible for reviewing the legislative audit.Maryland General Assembly Joint Audit Committee Accessed 7 April 2007. Auditor competence and independence Joint audit addresses two underlying principles of audit quality: auditors‚Äô competence and independence. It enables a benchmarking of audit approaches and affords audit committees the opportunity to pick and choose the best local firms from within two global audit networks. Audit committees and investors have additional assurance that the audit opinion with which they are presented is complete. A joint audit allows rotation of audit firms, and retains knowledge and understanding of group operations in a way that minimizes the disruption caused when a single audit firm is changed. The rotation of audit firms is equally likely to mitigate the risk of over familiarity. Two firms can also stand stronger together against aggressive accounting treatments. In this way, joint audit effectively becomes a guardian for audit quality. The benchmarking that takes place between the two firms raises the level of service quality. In India, members of the company has the liberty to choose joint auditors.Companies Act 2013 Market competition A joint audit has a further benefit in that it can encourage more competition between audit firms. Despite the fact that two Big Four firms can still be used on a joint audit, there is an opportunity for companies to be more willing to engage other firms in the process. The Big Four then becomes the best seven or eight, as more firms are given the opportunity to demonstrate their capabilities, while clients can retain a Big Four signature where they feel it is needed. A recent report produced by consultants London Economics for the European Commission highlighted that France and Denmark (two countries with joint audits) are the two least concentrated audit markets in Europe. Some critics believe that it is difficult for two firms, who outside of the joint audit are competitors, to easily co-operate with each other during the audit. The degree of co- operation, and its effectiveness, is essentially down to the spirit in which the two audit firms approach the joint audit. If they approach the audit with a willingness to work together to provide a company's shareholders with what they truly value ‚Äì namely confidence in the financial position of the company in which they are investing ‚Äì communication will not be a problem. If they favour competition over collaboration, the outcome is poor. Costs Increased costs is the most commonly cited objection to joint audits. Joint audit adds approximately 10% to audit time, mostly at the highest levels of the audit team (managers and partners). In the longer term, it could bring about a reduction in audit costs as a result of (1) increased market competition, and (2) benchmarking of prices and efficiencies between the two joint auditors by the Audit Committee of the audited organization. Joint audit delivers increased reporting on audit time and rates applied across the group. A recent comparative analysis of audit fees between Germany and France shows that companies with joint audit pay significantly less for their audit than companies without joint audit. Joint audit increases time spent by the senior staff on the audit team, and the senior management of the group or organization. Joint Audit (Tax) A joint tax audit is the examination of a business or individual tax return by a common audit team with members of two or more States examining cross-border tax situations as one tax audit to gain a uniform actual and legal assessment concerning this situation.Till Meickmann, Taxing German-Dutch Cross-Border Business Activities, p. 397.

Forged out of a counter-revolutionary heritage, its governments advocated a ‚Äúnationalist Christian‚Äù policy; they extolled heroism, faith, and unity; they despised the French Revolution, and they spurned the liberal and socialist ideologies of the 19th century. The governments saw Hungary as a bulwark against bolshevism and bolshevism‚Äôs instruments: socialism, cosmopolitanism, and Freemasonry. They perpetrated the rule of a small clique of aristocrats, civil servants, and army officers, and surrounded with adulation the head of the state, the counterrevolutionary Admiral Horthy. Istv√°n De√°k, ‚ÄúHungary‚Äù in Hans Roger and Egon Weber,eds., The European right: A historical profile (1963) p 364-407 quoting p. 364. Hungarian Democratic Republic On October 31, 1918, the Hungarian Democratic Republic was created by revolution that started in Budapest after the dissolution and break-up of Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I. The official proclamation of the republic was on November 16, 1918, and Mih√°ly K√°rolyi was named as the republic's Prime Minister. This event also marked the independence of Hungary which had been ruled by the Habsburg Monarchy for several centuries. The Hungarian Democratic Republic did not last long. Another revolution in 1919 marked the end of this state and the creation of a new communist state known as Hungarian Soviet Republic. Hungarian Republic of Councils Communist J√≥zsef Pog√°ny speaks to revolutionary soldiers during the 1919 revolution The rise of the Hungarian Communist Party (HCP) to power was rapid. The party was organized in a Moscow hotel on November 4, 1918, when a group of Hungarian prisoners of war and communist sympathizers formed a Central Committee and dispatched members to Hungary to recruit new members, propagate the party's ideas, and radicalize K√°rolyi's government. By February 1919, the party numbered 30,000 to 40,000 members, including many unemployed ex-soldiers, young intellectuals, and Jews. Hungarian Soviet Republic. U.S. Library of Congress Country Study In the same month, B√©la Kun was imprisoned for incitement to riot, but his popularity skyrocketed when a journalist reported that he had been beaten by the police. Kun emerged from jail triumphant when the Social Democrats handed power to a government of \\"People's Commissars,\\" who proclaimed the Hungarian Soviet Republic on March 21, 1919. The communists wrote a temporary constitution guaranteeing freedom of speech and assembly; free education, language and cultural rights to minorities; and other rights. It also provided for suffrage for people over eighteen years of age except clergy, \\"former exploiters,\\" and certain others. Single-list elections took place in April, but members of the parliament were selected indirectly by popularly elected committees. On June 25, Kun's government proclaimed a dictatorship of the proletariat, nationalized industrial and commercial enterprises, and socialized housing, transport, banking, medicine, cultural institutions, and all landholdings of more than 40.5 hectares. Kun undertook these measures even though the Hungarian communists were relatively few, and the support they enjoyed was based far more on their program to restore Hungary's borders than on their revolutionary agenda. Kun hoped that the Russian government would intervene on Hungary's behalf and that a worldwide workers' revolution was imminent. In an effort to secure its rule in the interim, the communist government resorted to arbitrary violence. Revolutionary tribunals ordered about 590 executions, including some for \\"crimes against the revolution.\\" The government also used \\"red terror\\" to expropriate grain from peasants. This violence and the regime's moves against the clergy also shocked many Hungarians. In late May, Kun attempted to fulfill his promise to restore Hungary's borders. The Hungarian Red Army marched northward and reoccupied part of Slovakia. Despite initial military success, however, Kun withdrew his troops about three weeks later when the French threatened to intervene. This concession shook his popular support. Kun then unsuccessfully turned the Hungarian Red Army on the Romanians, who broke through Hungarian lines on July 30, occupied Budapest, and ousted Kun's Soviet Republic on August 1, 1919. Kun fled first to Vienna and then to the Russian SFSR, where he was executed during Stalin's purge of foreign communists in the late 1930s. = Counterrevolution= A militantly anti-communist authoritarian government composed of military officers entered Budapest on the heels of the Romanians. A \\"white terror\\" ensued that led to the imprisonment, torture, and execution without trial of communists, socialists, Jews, leftist intellectuals, sympathizers with the K√°rolyi and Kun regimes, and others who threatened the traditional Hungarian political order that the officers sought to reestablish. Estimates placed the number of executions at approximately 5,000.Counterrevolution. U.S. Library of Congress Country Study In addition, about 75,000 people were jailed. In particular, the Hungarian right wing and the Romanian forces targeted Jews for retribution. Ultimately, the white terror forced nearly 100,000 people to leave the country, most of them socialists, intellectuals, and middle-class Jews. Monarchy restored In March 1920, Admiral Mikl√≥s Horthy was named Regent and S√°ndor Simonyi-Semadam was named Prime Minister of the restored Kingdom of Hungary. Charles I of Austria (known as Charles IV, Karl IV, or IV. K√°roly in Hungary) was the last Emperor of Austria and the last King of Hungary. He was not asked to fill the vacant Hungarian throne. The government of Horthy immediately declared null and void all laws and edicts passed by the Karolyi and Kun regimes, in effect renouncing the 1918 armistice. Horthy's authoritarianism and the violent anti-communist backlash resulted in interwar Hungary having one of the quietest political landscapes in Central Europe. Later on, when he wished to take out loans from the West, they pressured him into democratic reforms. Horthy only did as much as he absolutely had to, since the Western powers were geographically distant from Hungary and soon turned their attention to matters elsewhere. Horthy appointed P√°l Teleki as Prime Minister in July 1920. His right-wing government set quotas effectively limiting admission of Jews to universities, legalized capital punishment, and to quiet rural discontent, took initial steps towards fulfilling a promise of major land reform by dividing about 385,000 hectares from the largest estates into smallholdings. Teleki's government resigned, however, after the former Austrian Emperor, Charles IV, unsuccessfully attempted to retake Hungary's throne in March 1921. King Charles' return split parties between conservatives who favored a Habsburg restoration and nationalist right-wing radicals who supported election of a Hungarian king. Istv√°n Bethlen, a nonaffiliated, right-wing member of the parliament, took advantage of this rift by convincing members of the Christian National Union who opposed Karl's re-enthronement to merge with the Smallholders' Party and form a new Party of Unity with Bethlen as its leader. Horthy then appointed Bethlen Prime Minister. As Prime Minister, Bethlen dominated Hungarian politics between 1921 and 1931. He fashioned a political machine by amending the electoral law, eliminating peasants from the Party of Unity, providing jobs in the bureaucracy to his supporters, and manipulating elections in rural areas. Bethlen restored order to the country by giving the radical counter-revolutionaries payoffs and government jobs in exchange for ceasing their campaign of terror against Jews and leftists. In 1921, Bethlen made a deal with the Social Democrats and trade unions, agreeing, among other things, to legalize their activities and free political prisoners in return for their pledge to refrain from spreading anti- Hungarian propaganda, calling political strikes, and organizing the peasantry. In May 1922, the Party of Unity captured a large parliamentary majority. Charles IV's death, soon after he failed a second time to reclaim the throne in October 1921, allowed the revision of the Treaty of Trianon to rise to the top of Hungary's political agenda. Bethlen's strategy to win the treaty's revision was first to strengthen his country's economy and then to build relations with stronger nations that could further Hungary's goals. Revision of the treaty had such a broad backing in Hungary that Bethlen used it, at least in part, to deflect criticism of his economic, social, and political policies. However, Bethlen's only foreign policy success was a treaty of friendship with Italy in 1927, which had little immediate impact.  Postwar political and economic conditions  In 1920 and 1921, internal chaos racked Hungary. The white terror continued to plague Jews and leftists, unemployment and inflation soared, and penniless Hungarian refugees poured across the border from neighboring countries and burdened the floundering economy. The government offered the population little succor. In January 1920, Hungarian men and women cast the first secret ballots in the country's political history and elected a large counterrevolutionary and agrarian majority to a unicameral parliament. Two main political parties emerged: the socially conservative Christian National Union and the Independent Smallholders' Party, which advocated land reform. In March, the parliament annulled both the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713 and the Compromise of 1867, and it restored the Hungarian monarchy but postponed electing a king until civil disorder had subsided. Instead, Admiral Mikl√≥s Horthy‚Äîa former commander in chief of the Austro- Hungarian navy‚Äîwas elected regent and was empowered, among other things, to appoint Hungary's prime minister, veto legislation, convene or dissolve the parliament, and command the armed forces. Difference between the borders of the Kingdom of Hungary before and after the Treaty of Trianon. Hungary's signing of the Treaty of Trianon on June 4, 1920, ratified the country's dismemberment, limited the size of its armed forces, and required reparations payments. The territorial provisions of the treaty, which ensured continued discord between Hungary and its neighbors, required the Hungarians to surrender more than two-thirds of their prewar lands. Romania acquired Transylvania; Yugoslavia gained Croatia, Slavonia, and Vojvodina; Slovakia became a part of Czechoslovakia; and Austria also acquired a small piece of pre-war Hungarian territory. Hungary also lost about 60 percent of its pre-war population, and about one-third of the 10 million ethnic Hungarians found themselves outside the diminished homeland.Trianon Hungary. U.S. Library of Congress Country Study The country's ethnic composition was left almost homogeneous. Hungarians constituted about 90 percent of the population, Germans made up about 6 to 8 percent, and Slovaks, Croats, Romanians, Jews, and other minorities accounted for the remainder. New international borders separated Hungary's industrial base from its sources of raw materials and its former markets for agricultural and industrial products. Its new circumstances forced Hungary to become a trading nation. Hungary lost 84 percent of its timber resources, 43 percent of its arable land, and 83 percent of its iron ore. Because most of the country's prewar industry was concentrated near Budapest, Hungary retained about 51 percent of its industrial population, 56 percent of its industry, 82 percent of its heavy industry, and 70 percent of its banks. = Economic development = When Bethlen took office, the government was all-but-bankrupt. Tax revenues were so paltry that he turned to domestic gold and foreign-currency reserves to meet about half of the 1921‚Äì22 budget and almost 80 percent of the 1922‚Äì23 budget. To improve his country's economic circumstances, Bethlen undertook development of industry. He imposed tariffs on finished goods and earmarked the revenues to subsidize new industries. Bethlen squeezed the agricultural sector to increase cereal exports, which generated foreign currency to pay for imports critical to the industrial sector. Further compounding Hungary's problems was the fact that of its four neighbors, three (Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia) were enemies and kept troops stationed on their borders at all times, even though Hungary had an army of only 20,000 men. The fourth, Austria, was a struggling nation and little more than an economic competitor. In 1924, after the white terror had waned and Hungary had gained admission to the League of Nations (1922), the Bethlen government was able to borrow a US$50 million loan from the League, which in order to protect its investment placed the country in effective receivership, even placing an American banker, Jeremiah Smith, in charge of the country's finances. Hungary's outcast status had prevented it from obtaining any foreign aid in the immediate postwar period, but by the middle of the 1920s, the British decided to extend the hand of friendship to the losers of World War I. Hungary also obtained sympathy from the United States and Mussolini's Italy. Meanwhile, France and Hungary's neighbors vigorously objected. By the late 1920s, Bethlen's policies had brought order to the economy. The number of factories increased by about 66 percent, inflation subsided, and the national income climbed 20 percent. However, the apparent stability was supported by a rickety framework of constantly revolving foreign credits and high world grain prices; therefore, Hungary remained undeveloped in comparison with the wealthier western European countries, as most of the foreign loans went for non-productive purposes such as graft, expanding bureaucracy, and monumental public works projects. Agricultural products were subject to unstable prices and the vagaries of the weather. Furthermore, tariffs were commonplace in America and Europe during the 1920s, which frequently made it difficult to export. Hungary was no exception and liberally employed trade barriers to protect its manufacturing base. Exports also had to pass through Hungary's neighbors to reach the West, and as noted above, all but one was hostile. Despite economic progress, the workers' standard of living remained poor, and consequently the working class never gave Bethlen its political support. The labor movement had never developed in pre-World War I Hungary the way it did in Austria, and the Horthy government remained resolutely opposed to organized labor or social reforms. There was no minimum wage or any sort of labor laws in Hungary almost until the start of World War II, and wages were further undercut by peasants flocking into Budapest who were willing to work for almost nothing. On the whole, workers fared more poorly in interwar Hungary then they had before World War I. The peasants were even worse off than the working class. In the 1920s, about 60 percent of the peasants were either landless or were cultivating plots too small to provide a decent living. Real wages for agricultural workers remained below prewar levels, and the peasants had practically no political voice. Moreover, once Bethlen had consolidated his power, he ignored calls for land reform. The industrial sector failed to expand fast enough to provide jobs for all the peasants and university graduates seeking work. Most peasants lingered in the villages, and in the 1930s Hungarians in rural areas were extremely dissatisfied. Hungary's foreign debt ballooned as Bethlen expanded the bureaucracy to absorb the university graduates who, if left idle, might have threatened civil order. This was because Hungary, like the rest of Eastern Europe, had an educational system primarily focused on the liberal arts and law rather than science, engineering, or other practical subjects that might have helped the country's development. University graduates mostly sought employment in the bureaucracy, where they were guaranteed an easy, secure job. When they could not obtain work, either because they lacked useful skills or because the swollen bureaucracy had no openings available, they would invariably blame their bad luck on Jews. This would contribute to an anti-Semitism in Hungary that would ultimately have tragic consequences. Following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 in the United States and the beginning of the Great Depression, world grain prices plummeted, and the framework supporting Hungary's economy buckled. Hungary's earnings from grain exports declined as prices and volume dropped, tax revenues fell, foreign credit sources dried up, and short-term loans were called in. The Hungarian national bank depleted its supply of precious metals and foreign currency during a period of a few weeks in 1931. Hungary sought financial relief from the League of Nations, which insisted on a program of rigid fiscal belt-tightening, resulting in increased unemployment. The peasants reverted to subsistence farming. Industrial production rapidly dropped, and businesses went bankrupt as domestic and foreign demand evaporated. Government workers lost their jobs or suffered severe pay cuts. By 1933 about 18 percent of Budapest's citizens lived in poverty. Unemployment leapt from 5 percent in 1928 to almost 36 percent by 1933.  Shift to the right  As the standard of living dropped, the political mood of the country shifted further towards the right. Bethlen resigned without warning amid national turmoil in August 1931. His successor, Gyula K√°rolyi, failed to quell the crisis. Horthy then appointed a reactionary demagogue, Gyula G√∂mb√∂s, but only after G√∂mb√∂s agreed to maintain the existing political system, to refrain from calling elections before the parliament's term had expired, and to appoint several Bethlen supporters to head key ministries. G√∂mb√∂s publicly renounced the vehement antisemitism he had espoused earlier, and his party and government included some Jews. G√∂mb√∂s's appointment marked the beginning of the radical right's ascendancy in Hungarian politics, which lasted with few interruptions until 1945. The radical right garnered its support from medium and small farmers, former refugees from Hungary's lost territories, and unemployed civil servants, army officers, and university graduates. G√∂mb√∂s advocated a one-party government, revision of the Treaty of Trianon, withdrawal from the League of Nations, anti-intellectualism, and social reform. He assembled a political machine, but his efforts to fashion a one- party state and fulfill his reform platform were frustrated by a parliament composed mostly of Bethlen's supporters and by Hungary's creditors, who forced G√∂mb√∂s to follow conventional policies in dealing with the economic and financial crisis. The 1935 elections gave G√∂mb√∂s more solid support in the parliament, and he succeeded in gaining control of the ministries of finance, industry, and defense and in replacing several key military officers with his supporters. In September 1936, G√∂mb√∂s informed German officials that he would establish a Nazi-like, one-party government in Hungary within two years, but he died in October without realizing this goal. In foreign affairs, G√∂mb√∂s led Hungary towards close relations with Italy and especially Germany; in fact, G√∂mb√∂s coined the term Axis, which was later adopted by the German-Italian military alliance. Soon after his appointment, G√∂mb√∂s visited Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and gained his support for revision of the Treaty of Trianon. Later, G√∂mb√∂s became the first foreign head of government to visit German chancellor Adolf Hitler. For a time, Hungary profited handsomely, as G√∂mb√∂s signed a trade agreement with Germany that drew Hungary's economy out of depression but made Hungary dependent on the German economy for both raw materials and markets. In 1928, Germany had accounted for 19.5 percent of Hungary's imports and 11.7 percent of its exports; by 1939 the figures were 52.5 percent and 52.2 percent, respectively.Radical Right in Power. U.S. Library of Congress Country Study Hungary's annual rate of economic growth from 1934 to 1940 averaged 10.8 percent. The number of workers in industry doubled in the ten years after 1933, and the number of agricultural workers dropped below 50 percent for the first time in the country's history. = On the eve of World War II = Map of territories reassigned to Hungary in 1938‚Äì1941 The Kingdom of Hungary also used its relationship with Germany to chip away at the Treaty of Trianon. In 1938, Hungary openly repudiated the treaty's restrictions on its armed forces. With German help, Hungary extended its territory four times and doubled in size from 1938 to 1941, even fighting a short war with the newly created Slovakia. Hungary regained parts of southern Slovakia in 1938, Carpatho-Ukraine in 1939, northern Transylvania in 1940, and parts of Vojvodina in 1941. Hitler's assistance did not come without a price. After 1938, the F√ºhrer used promises of additional territories, economic pressure, and threats of military intervention to pressure the Hungarians into supporting his policies, including those related to Europe's Jews, which encouraged Hungary's antisemites. The percentage of Jews in business, finance, and the professions far exceeded the percentage of Jews in the overall population. After the depression struck, antisemites made the Jews scapegoats for Hungary's economic plight. Hungary's Jews suffered the first blows of this renewed anti-Semitism during the government of G√∂mb√∂s's successor, K√°lm√°n Dar√°nyi, who fashioned a coalition of conservatives and reactionaries and dismantled G√∂mb√∂s's political machine. After Horthy publicly dashed hopes of land reform, discontented right-wingers took to the streets denouncing the government and baiting the Jews. Dar√°nyi's government attempted to appease the anti-Semites and the Nazis by proposing and passing the first so-called Jewish Law, which set quotas limiting Jews to 20 percent of the positions in certain businesses and professions. The law failed to satisfy Hungary's anti-Semitic radicals, however, and when Dar√°nyi tried to appease them again, Horthy unseated him in 1938. The regent then appointed the ill- starred B√©la Imr√©dy, who drafted a second, harsher Jewish Law before political opponents forced his resignation in February 1939 by presenting documents showing that Imr√©dy's own grandfather was a Jew. Statue of P√°l Teleki Imr√©dy's downfall led to P√°l Teleki's return to the prime minister's office. Teleki dissolved some of the fascist parties but did not alter the fundamental policies of his predecessors. He undertook a bureaucratic reform and launched cultural and educational programs to help the rural poor. But Teleki also oversaw passage of the second Jewish Law, which broadened the definition of \\"Jewishness,\\" cut the quotas on Jews permitted in the professions and in business, and required that the quotas be attained by the hiring of Gentiles or the firing of Jews. By the June 1939 elections, Hungarian public opinion had shifted so far to the right that voters gave the Arrow Cross Party ‚ÄìHungary's equivalent of Germany's Nazi Party‚Äìthe second highest number of votes. In September 1940, the Hungarian government allowed German troops to transit the country on their way to Romania, and on November 20, 1940, Teleki signed the Tripartite Pact, which allied the country with Germany, Italy, and Japan, and ensured Hungary's involvement in the Second World War. Social structure Until World War I, striking inequalities distinguished the distribution of wealth, power, privilege, and opportunity among social groups. The various social strata had different codes of behavior and distinctive dress, speech, and manners. Respect showed to persons varied according to the source of their wealth. Wealth derived from possession of land was valued more highly than that coming from trade or banking. The country was predominantly rural, and landownership was the central factor in determining the status and prestige of most families. In some of the middle and upper strata of society, noble birth was also an important criterion as was, in some cases, the holding of certain occupations. An intricate system of ranks and titles distinguished the various social stations. Hereditary titles designated the aristocracy and gentry. Persons who had achieved positions of eminence, whether or not they were of noble birth, often received nonhereditary titles from the state. The gradations of rank derived from titles had great significance in social intercourse and in the relations between the individual and the state. Among the rural population, which consisted largely of peasants and which made up the overwhelming majority of the country's people, distinctions derived from such factors as the size of a family's landholding; whether the family owned the land and hired help to work it, owned and worked the land itself, or worked for others; and family reputation. The prestige and respect accompanying landownership were evident in many facets of life in the countryside, from finely shaded modes of polite address, to special church seating, to selection of landed peasants to fill public offices. Landowners, wealthy bankers, aristocrats and gentry, and various commercial leaders made up the elite. Together, these groups accounted for only 13 percent of the population. Between 10 and 18 percent of the population consisted of the petite bourgeoisie and the petty gentry, various government officials, intellectuals, retail store owners, and well-to-do professionals. More than two-thirds of the remaining population lived in varying degrees of poverty. Their only real chance for upward mobility lay in becoming civil servants, but such advancement was difficult because of the exclusive nature of the education system. The industrial working class was growing, but the largest group remained the peasantry, most of whom had too little land or none at all. Although the inter-war years witnessed considerable cultural and economic progress in the country, the social structure changed little. A great chasm remained between the gentry, both social and intellectual, and the rural \\"people.\\" Jews held a place of prominence in the country's economic, social, and political life. They constituted the bulk of the middle class. They were well assimilated, worked in a variety of professions, and were of various political persuasions.

It is named after Neil McNeil, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Vancouver from 1910 to 1912 and Roman Catholic Archbishop of Toronto from 1912 to 1934. Neil McNeil is one of 31 high schools run by the TCDSB and one of four all-boys schools, and currently has an enrollment of 826 students. The school offers a Broad- based technology centre, cooperative education program and one of the largest visual arts studios in the city. This school is a sister school to Notre Dame High School. History In 1954, six Holy Ghost Fathers came from Ireland. Their original purpose was to get missionaries as Archbishop James Charles McGuigan wanted an all-boys school in east Toronto and the first high school in Scarborough that was founded in 1958 by the Holy Ghost Fathers. The school was named after Neil McNeil, Archbishop of Toronto from 1912 to 1934. During his entire term as Archbishop, he fought tirelessly for the extension of funding for Catholic secondary schools. He demonstrated in both words and deeds the school motto ‚ÄúFidelitas in Arduis‚Äù, which translates to ‚ÄúFaith In Hard Times‚Äù. From its inception, priests came out to teach. The first principal was Father Troy until his retirement in 1965. At first the school was a two-story building with no gym and no cafeteria. In 1960, the third floor and gymnatorium as well as the cafeteria were added. In 1967, the school entered an agreement with the Metropolitan Separate School Board (now the Toronto Catholic District School Board, where, by Grade 9 and 10, students would be under the publicly funded separate school system and Grades 11, 12, and 13 would continue as a private school. Since 1987, the school was fully funded by government and Neil McNeil was ceased as a private school. The school was maintained and operated fully by the MSSB although the Spiritans continue to lease the school. Even though the last priest-principal of the school retired in 1990, the Spiritan presence is alive and well through the Spiritan Scholarship Fund established in 1995. By 1998, the fund disbursed more than $50,000 in scholarship awards for students going to university or community college. Notre Dame is the \\"Sister School\\" of Neil McNeil Catholic Secondary School located not far from Neil McNeil. Both of these schools are regarded as among the oldest and most discriminative high schools in the TCDSB and in the city of Toronto. It is a school renowned for its elaborate and spirited school assemblies and tight knit community. Neil McNeil's patron saint is the Holy Spirit. The Toronto Catholic District School Board acquired Neil McNeil's school facilities from the Spiritans' in 2009. =Threatened closure and possible relocation= Neil McNeil was one of five schools in the Toronto Catholic District School Board (along with Cardinal Newman, Jean Vanier, Notre Dame and St. Patrick) underwent a school accommodation review in June 2009, which were part of four clusters of 17 schools under review ‚Äî either have too many or too few students and could be consolidated, relocated or closed. In December, the board decided to close two schools and relocate another.Sheila Dabu Nonato (Catholic Register): Community fights to keep Neil McNeil at home - January 15, 2010, Retrieved Sept. 5, 2013. The school's parent council co-chair Nicole Waldron said the group is opposed to one of the three options presented by the board for students from Neil to be relocated from Victoria Park and Kingston Road near the Scarborough Bluffs to St. Patrick (on the former Lakeview Secondary School grounds) in the Greenwood and Danforth Avenues area. He stated that ‚ÄúWe are here tonight to say that the history of closing schools must end in this process. We are not here to close and to relocate Neil McNeil,‚Äù Waldron told a boisterous crowd of about 400 people at a public meeting on January 7 at Neil. The review of the east-end schools came into light because there are too many students at Cardinal Newman, Neil McNeil, Notre Dame and Jean Vanier and too few students at St. Patrick. However, both the sites of Jean Vanier and St. Patrick are currently owned by the Toronto District School Board via the Toronto Lands Corporation (TLC) realtor arm if returned while the Newman property and land is owned by St. Augustine's Seminary. In this particular grouping, the TCDSB explored three main options:Joanna Lavoie Students, parents demand local Catholic high schools be kept open - East York Mirror, January 12, 2010.

Since the issue came to light in fall of 2009, local stakeholders have passionately expressed their desire to go with the third option of investing in bettering St. Patrick. Some of the possibilities could include refocusing the school into a centre for the arts, implementing a kindergarten to Grade 12 (K-12) French immersion program or even offering year-round school for students there from K-12. The end result was St. Patrick became the Centre for the Arts, Media, and Technology in June 2010.Catholic Register: [Toronto St. Patrick School embraces art and media] - January 15, 2010, Retrieved Sept. 5, 2013. Since then, the school board agreed with the Spiritans to make every effort possible to maintain the Neil facility for the next 50 years. That agreement is a clause in the June 2009 purchase agreement between the TCDSB and the Spiritan order. School spirit Every Friday morning, the school song is sung, replacing the singing of O Canada on other weekdays. School spirit and student life is fostered by the elected Student Council. Since the 2011-2012 academic year, Student Council has had autonomy over their affairs, reporting directly to the Principal. This has allowed Council to make quick decisions.

The ship was laid down in March 1898, was launched in November that year, and was completed in September 1901. Formidable served initially with the Mediterranean Fleet, transferring to the Channel Fleet in 1908. In 1912, she was assigned to the 5th Battle Squadron, which was stationed at Nore. Following the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the squadron conducted operations in the English Channel, and was based at Sheerness to guard against a possible German invasion. In the first days of the war, the 5th Battle Squadron covered the crossing of the British Expeditionary Force to France. On 31 December, the squadron was conducting training exercises in the English Channel, and despite the risk of German submarines, was without anti-submarine protection; the German stalked the ships during the day and in the early hours of 1 January 1915, torpedoed Formidable twice, sinking her with very heavy loss of life. Design Line-drawing of the Formidable class The design for the Formidable class was prepared in 1897; it was an incremental improvement over the preceding and es. Formidable adopted the larger size of the Majestics, while taking the stronger Krupp armour of the Canopus design. In addition, the new design incorporated longer (and thus more powerful) main and secondary guns and an improved hull form. These characteristics produced a ship with better armour protection than either earlier class, the same high speed of Canopus. Formidable was long overall, with a beam of and a draught of . She displaced normally and up to fully loaded. Her crew numbered 780 officers and ratings. The Formidable-class ships were powered by a pair of 3-cylinder triple-expansion engines, with steam provided by twenty Belleville boilers. The boilers were trunked into two funnels located amidships. The Formidable-class ships had a top speed of from . Formidable had a main battery of four 40-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft; these guns were mounted in circular barbettes that allowed all-around loading or elevation. The ships also mounted a secondary battery of twelve 45-calibre guns mounted in casemates, in addition to ten 12-pounder guns and six 3-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. As was customary for battleships of the period, she was also equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged in the hull. Formidable had an armoured belt that was thick; the transverse bulkheads on either end of the belt were thick. Her main battery turrets sides were thick, atop barbettes, and the casemate battery was protected with 6 in of Krupp steel. Her conning tower had thick sides as well. She was fitted with two armoured decks, thick, respectively. Service history Starboard bow view of Formidable HMS Formidable was laid down at Portsmouth Dockyard on 21 March 1898 and launched on 17 November 1898; she was, at the time of her launching, very incomplete, and she was launched primarily to clear the slipway so construction could begin on the battleship . Formidable was completed in September 1901, and was commissioned at Portsmouth on 10 October for service in the Mediterranean Fleet. Captain Alexander William Chisholm-Batten paid off HMS Resolution on 9 October and he and his crew turned over to Formidable on the following day. In September 1902 she visited the Aegean sea with other ships of the station for combined manoeuvres near Nauplia, and the following year she was escort ship to the royal yacht HMY Victoria and Albert when the King visited the Mediterranean. She began a refit at Malta in 1904 which lasted until April 1905, and in April 1908 transferred to the Channel Fleet. Paid off at Chatham Dockyard on 17 August 1908, Formidable began another refit and recommissioned on 20 April 1909 for service in the 1st Division, Home Fleet, stationed at the Nore. On 29 May, she transferred to the Atlantic Fleet. In May 1912, Formidable was reduced to a nucleus crew and transferred to the 5th Battle Squadron in the Second Fleet, Home Fleet, again at the Nore, where she served until the outbreak of war in August 1914. Hard steaming during this service led to her developing serious machinery problems. =World War I= At the beginning of the First World War, Formidable and the 5th Battle Squadron were based at Portland and assigned to the Channel Fleet to defend the English Channel. After covering the safe transportation of the British Expeditionary Force to France in August 1914, Formidable took part in the transportation of the Portsmouth Marine Battalion to Ostend on 25 August. On 14 November, Formidable and the other ships of the 5th Battle Squadron were rebased at Sheerness because of concern that a German invasion of Great Britain was in the offing. The squadron was relieved by Duncan-class battleships of the 6th Battle Squadron and transferred to Portland on 30 December. Loss Under the command of Vice-Admiral Commanding, Channel Fleet, Sir Lewis Bayly, the 5th Battle Squadron spent 31 December participating in gunnery exercises off the Isle of Portland, supported by the light cruisers and . The squadron received no escort of destroyers for the operation. After the exercises, that night the fleet remained at sea on patrol even though submarine activity had been reported in the area. Visibility that night was good, though the sea was rough enough to make detection of a submarine difficult. Bayly suspected no danger from submarines, and so steamed his ships in line ahead formation at a speed of . Formidable was the last battleship in the line, followed only by the two cruisers. Unknown to the British, the German submarine stalked the squadron while it was exercising all afternoon, trying to find a suitable attack position. At around 02:20 on 1 January 1915, U-24 launched a torpedo at Formidable, striking her on the starboard side abreast of the forward funnel. Formidables commander, Captain Loxley, hoped to save the ship by bringing her close to shore; the other British ships were at that point unaware of what had happened, but after Formidable turned out of line, Topaze increased speed to determine what she was doing. By the time Topaze closed with Formidable twenty minutes later, the latter vessel had already taken on a list of 20 degrees to starboard, and Loxley had issued the order to abandon ship. Men attempting to save the vessel remained aboard and through counter-flooding reduced the list, though Formidable was by then very low in the water. At around 03:05, U-24 launched another torpedo at the stricken Formidable, hitting her again on the starboard side close to her bow. Topaze, joined by Diamond, began the rescue effort, but the heavy seas made it very difficult to bring men aboard. Formidable remained afloat for another hour and forty minutes, and at 04:45 began to capsize and sink by the bow. She remained afloat, with her stern in the air, for a few minutes before sinking. Loxley was last seen on the bridge calmly overseeing the evacuation of the ship. Diamond picked up thirty-seven officers and crew from the water. The Brixham trawler Provident picked up 73 members of Formidables crew from the battleship's launch at around midday, while Formidables pinnace managed to reach Lyme Regis after 22 hours at sea, saving another 47 men. A total of 35 officers and 512 men were killed in the sinking. An inquiry from the Admiralty into the sinking determined that the risk of conducting training exercises in the Channel without destroyer protection was excessive and should not be continued. Bayly was relieved of command for failing to take adequate precautions against submarine attack.

Activities The Council offers both personal and commercial memberships which allow individual participants to have discussions and swap recipes with fellow pie lovers, while providing commercial members with business networking opportunities and promotional support. The APC has run the APC National Pie Championships since 1995. The event is usually held in Celebration, Florida. The competition is open to amateur, professional, and commercial bakers.

This should not be confused with Pi Day which the U.S. Congress recognizes as March 14. In 2014, the APC partnered with Paramount Pictures in promoting the romantic thriller film Labor Day in conjunction with National Pie Day. (A pie-making scene features prominently in the film, and the film's general release was within a few days of National Pie Day.) The APC distributed a promotional poster to pie shops and bakeries featuring images of the film's stars Kate Winslet, Josh Brolin, and Gattlin Griffith in the pie-making scene. New York Post writer Lou Lumenick noted dryly that the scene was an \\"eccentric choice for a promotion\\" since Brolin's character is an escaped murderer and \\"before they all make pies together, he abducts them from a supermarket and ties both of them up... A bond does emerge between Brolin and his hostages before he surrenders to police. But still.\\" The poster is captioned in part \\"It makes the time we spend together, just a little sweeter. Pie.

Early life and education Langdale was born on 18 June 1783 at Kirkby Lonsdale, the third son of Henry Bickersteth, a surgeon, and Elizabeth Batty. His younger brother was Rev. Edward Bickersteth, whose son was Edward Henry became Bishop of Exeter and grandson was Edward was Bishop of South Tokyo. By the advice of his uncle, Dr. Robert Batty, in October 1801, he went to Edinburgh to pursue his medical studies, and in the following year was called home to take his father's practice in his temporary absence. Disliking the idea of settling down in the country as a general practitioner, young Bickersteth determined to become a London physician. With a view to obtaining a medical degree, on 22 June 1802 his name was entered in the books of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, and, on 27 October in the same year, he was elected a scholar on the Hewitt foundation. Owing to his intense application to work, his health broke down after his first term. Career A change of scene being deemed necessary to insure his recovery, he obtained, through Dr. Batty, the post of medical attendant to Edward, fifth earl of Oxford, who was then on a tour in Italy. After his return from the continent he continued with the Earl of Oxford until 1805, when he returned to Cambridge. At this time he wanted to enter the army, but his parents disapproved. After three years he was senior Smith's mathematical prizeman of his year (1808), Miles Bland, Charles James Blomfield and Adam Sedgwick being among the competitors. He graduated senior wrangler from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge in 1808 and after training as a physician like his father, he turned to law. Having taken his degree, Bickersteth was immediately elected a fellow of his college, and thereupon made up his mind to enter the profession of the law. On 8 April 1808, he was admitted to the Inner Temple as a student, and, in the beginning of 1810, became a pupil of John Bell, and was called to the Bar on 22 November 1811. Bickersteth became a King's Counsel in 1827, and 1836 brought him membership of the Privy Council, appointment as Master of the Rolls and a peerage, which he accepted on condition that he could concentrate on law reform and remain politically independent. He was created Baron Langdale, of Langdale in the County of Westmoreland on 23 January 1836. He was determined that the government should provide an adequate Public Record Office and became known as the \\"father of record reform\\". As Master of the Rolls he was in effect Keeper of The Public Records. After the Public Records Act of 1838, he and his Deputy Keeper, Francis Palgrave, the full-time working head of the office, started to organise the transfer of state papers from the Tower of London, the chapter house of Westminster Abbey and elsewhere, to one single location. In 1850, ill health forced him to turn down the chance to become Lord Chancellor and he died the following year, on 18 April 1851, at Tunbridge Wells. Personal life Brampton Bryan Hall and Castle Langdale married Lady Jane Elizabeth Harley, daughter of his patron the 5th Earl of Oxford by licence on 17 August 1835, in St. James, Paddington, London. They had one daughter, Jane Frances (7 November 1836 ‚Äì 3 May 1870), who in 1857 married a Hungarian nobleman, Count . In 1853, on the death of his wife's brother, the 6th Earl of Oxford, they inherited the family seat of Brampton Bryan in Herefordshire. On his wife's death in 1872, it passed to a distant relative, William Daker Harley.

Running career Haglund became a member of Hanvikens SK, a track and field club located just south of Stockholm, at the age of 13. She showed great promise as a future sprinting star by recording, barefoot, 12.7 for 100 m at her first meet representing Hanvikens SK. Haglund's precocious talent was displayed on an international stage at the European Championships of 1971, held in Helsinki, Finland. She was named on the Swedish track and field team that competed in Helsinki that year. She was 15 at the time and acknowledged as the youngest athlete of the meet. One year later, Haglund was appointed to the first of three Swedish Olympic teams: Munich, 1972. Her running career would take her to the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games, as well as those held in Moscow in 1980. Haglund had her best Olympic Games' showing with a fourth place in the Moscow Games' 100 m final. Haglund participated in the World Cups of 1979 (Montreal) and 1981 (Rome) and was a five-time medalist at European Championships held in 1976 (gold), 1978 (silver), 1978 (silver), 1980 (silver), and 1981 (silver). Haglund was the captain for many years of the women's track and field team in Sweden and still holds Swedish records for 100 m - 11.16 (1980), 200 m - 22.82 (1978), and 60 m - 7.13 (1978).

A Swedish board of adjudicators found Haglund innocent of charges (she alleged her coach had given her two pills he called 'vitamins') but turned over their decision for further consideration to an international track and field tribunal assembled in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1982. This tribunal found against Haglund, who then retired. =Legacy= Haglund was a member of the Swedish Sports Academy (consisting of 100 athletes in 100 years of Swedish sport from 1899-1999), and was awarded the Victoria Scholarship in 1981.

It is part of the nationwide Multicultural Radio Broadcasting network, one of 30 stations owned by Arthur Liu, which cater to minority and immigrant communities with programs in their native languages. The transmitter is located off 118th Avenue SE in Bellevue, near Kelsey Creek.Radio-Locator.com/KXPA KXPA is powered at 5,000 watts. But at night, to avoid interfering with other stations on 1540, KXPA uses a directional antenna, with much of the signal pointed west over Seattle and Puget Sound. Programming KXPA airs brokered ethnic programming days and evenings, with adult standards from the \\"Music of Your Life\\" Network heard late nights. Clients buy blocks of time on KXPA and host shows in their native language, supported by advertisers targeting those communities. Languages include Spanish, Russian, Mandarin and Vietnamese. History KXPA is derived from two radio stations. The AM 1540 station signed on the air in March 1964 as KBVU.Broadcasting Yearbook 1966 page B-161 It was owned by Birch Bay Broadcasting, powered at 1,000 watts. KBVU aired a jazz format, but went dark in 1967. Another station in Bellevue, KFKF, had signed on the air in March 1958 at AM 1330. It was a 1,000-watt daytimer, required to go off the air at sunset. In 1969, Kemper Freeman, who owned KFKF, purchased the license for AM 1540 so he could move his station there and make it a round-the-clock operation. AM 1540 then became KFKF. Stewart Ballinger bought KFKF in August 1972, switching the call sign to KBES, with a middle of the road (MOR) format. KBES was co-owned with 92.5 KFKF-FM (now KQMV). The two simulcast most of their programming. In November 1974, when 92.5 FM flipped to progressive rock as KZAM-FM, the AM followed suit and became KZAM, still simulcasting. On May 19, 1978, after Sandusky Broadcasting bought the stations, KZAM adopted a \\"Rock of the ‚Äò80s\\" new wave format, the first of its kind in the Seattle market. The FM continued to air album rock until July 1983, when it flipped to adult contemporary music. Due to poor ratings, on February 23, 1981, KZAM went back to simulcasting the FM until July 15 of that year, when the AM became all-jazz KJZZ. On December 17, 1984, it became KLSY, with an automated hot adult contemporary sound. It became a complete simulcast of its FM sister a year later. In January 1992, due to Sandusky's purchase of AM 880 KIXI, the Federal Communications Commission's ownership limits put Sandusky over the maximum number of stations in the Seattle area. KLSY was spun off to new owners and became KBLV, with a classic country format known as \\"Country Gold.\\" KBLV formed a network by simulcasting with KJUN and KJUN-FM in Tacoma, KENU in Enumclaw, KTOL in Olympia, and KWYZ in Everett. In early 1996, the Country Gold Network discontinued operations due to financial problems, with all stations being put up for sale. KBLV was sold to new owners and flipped to an Urban Adult Contemporary format that year. The format didn't last long. In late 1996, after the station was sold to Personal Achievement Radio, 1540 AM adopted an all-talk format, offering advice on business and life, from the \\"Motivation Talk Network.\\" The station took the KXPA call letters on January 31, 1997. It was later sold, and flipped first to the \\"Z-Spanish\\" radio network. In October 2000, it was sold to Arthur Liu, for its current multicultural format.

Pressman and Chris Hanley. It stars Robert Downey Jr., Heather Graham and Natasha Gregson Wagner. The film is mainly based upon dialogue between the characters. It was shot almost entirely in real time, and within a single setting, leading some reviewers to compare the film to a stage play. Director James Toback told interviewers he wrote the film's screenplay in only four days and shot the film in just eleven days.  Plot  Two girls, Carla and Lou meet on the street outside a loft waiting for their boyfriends. After a short time, they find out that they're waiting for the same guy ‚Äì young actor Blake, who said that he loves both of them but had actually been leading a double life for several months. Angry, they break into his loft and when he returns, a round of accusations and explanations begins.  Cast  * Robert Downey Jr. as Blake Allen * Heather Graham as Carla Bennett * Natasha Gregson Wagner as Lou * Frederique van der Wal as Carol * Angel David as Tommy  Production  =Casting= Alongside The Gingerbread Man, the film was Robert Downey Jr.'s first role after a 1996 drug arrest. It has been reported that Downey Jr. was drug-tested on the set every day, and that roles such as this helped him temporarily stay clean before his eventual relapse in September 1997. In an interview with People magazine, Natasha Gregson Wagner implied she accepted the role of Louise (nicknamed Lou in the film) because she wanted to appear in unconventional or controversial pictures, stating that \\"I like working with bold people who want to make an impact. I‚Äôm not interested in being just another pretty face.\\" =Filming and post-production= Principal photography began during early 1997 in New York City. Before filming commenced, Gregson Wagner convinced director James Toback to remove a scene he originally wanted where her character masturbated to Downey Jr. and Heather Graham having sex, as she believed it wasn't realistic. In order for the film to receive an R-rating rather than an NC-17 rating, the sex scene involving Downey Jr. and Graham was toned down and re-edited. Both cuts have since been made available on home media.  Release  Two Girls and a Guy was copyrighted in 1997 and received its premiere at the 1997 Toronto International Film Festival. Originally an independent film, it was picked up by 20th Century Fox's indie acquisition division Fox Searchlight Pictures for a theatrical run in April 1998. It would be released to VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD in the late 90s and early 2000s by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, and was subsequently released on a Blu-ray by the company in late 2009, which includes both the R-rated and NC-17 versions. The Blu-ray edition includes a commentary track with Downey Jr., Gregson Wagner and Toback that originally appeared on Fox's 2002 DVD release, as well as a 21-minute interview with Toback that was exclusive to the Blu-ray release. =Reception= On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 51% based on 63 reviews, with an average rating of 5.66/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"Two Girls and a Guy has an intriguing premise and a talented trio of leads, but doesn't do quite enough with any of them to make the end result truly worth a watch\\". On an April 1998 episode of their program, Siskel and Ebert gave it two thumbs up. Jack Mathews of the Los Angeles Times said: \\"Two Girls and a Guy\\" takes a lot of dubious side trips and ends with an event so unexpected it could have come from a different movie. Maybe if Toback had taken 11 days to write the script and four to shoot it, things would have worked out better. As it is, \\"Two Girls\\" is a small movie with some big moments and a lot of unfinished business. In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert commented on Robert Downey Jr.'s performance: \\"Downey, whatever his problems, is a fine actor, smart and in command of his presence, and he's persuasive here as he defends himself: ‚ÄúI'm an actor. And actors lie.‚Äù There is a show-stopping scene when he looks at himself in a mirror and warns himself to get his act together.\\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times said: \\"When actors fall into tabloid hell, their careers too often are already on the skids. But Downey, who recently completed jail time for drug-related problems, proves again here that he is, professionally speaking, at the height of his powers. \\"Two Girls and a Guy\\" bursts into life as soon as this wildly inventive actor saunters into the story bellowing Vivaldi, and from that point on, it hangs on his every word. The two women here, especially the talented and ravishing Ms. Graham, aren't able to do anything of comparable interest.\\"  References   External links  * * Category:1997 films Category:American comedy-drama films Category:American films Category:1997 comedy-drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by James Toback Category:Films about actors Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films about threesomes Category:Fox Searchlight Pictures films Category:1997 comedy films Category:1997 drama films ","title":"Two Girls and a Guy"},{"id":"8022265","text":"Myocytolysis refers to a state of significant damage to cardiac myocytes, muscle cells of the heart, caused by myocardial strain. It was first described in medical literature by Schlesinger and Reiner in 1955. It is considered a type of cellular necrosis. Two types of myocytolysis have been defined: coagulative and colliquative. Coagulative myocytolysis appears in the myocardium near areas of coagulative necrosis or areas affected by myocardial infarction. This phenomenon tends to occur when neighboring cardiac muscle loses its ability to contract (i.e. in ischemia or infarction). The remaining viable muscles, as the result, strain to compensate for the loss of other muscles in order to deliver the necessary cardiac output. During the process, myocardial cells are stretched and stressed to produce new contractile elements. In colliquative myocytolysis, fluids accumulated within the cell dissolve myofibrils, resulting in vacuolization of the cell. It is considered an indicator of acute myocardial ischemia and can be used to confirm ischemia in the absence of other indicators of cause of death.

Busson entered the world of hedge funds in 1986 working in New York.Costello, Miles (31 December 2007). Monday manifesto: Arpad Busson; Retrieved 29 June 2008 from http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article3111342.ece He is the founder and Chairman of the EIM Group, a fund of funds company. Busson is also active in a number of philanthropic causes around the globe. According to the French business magazine Challenges, he has a net worth of ‚Ç¨290 million at 2013. Early life Arpad Busson's father, Pascal Busson, was a former French army officer and Algerian War veteran, who later turned financier. His mother, Florence \\"Flockie\\" Harcourt-Smith, was an English former debutante. His parents met in Paris and named their son after the Hungarian-born banker √Årp√°d Plesch (1889‚Äì1974), who not only was Florence's step-father (he was the second husband of her mother, Marysia Ulam Krauss Harcourt-Smith), but had also been her step-grandfather (Plesch's first wife, Leonie Caro Ulam, was his second wife's mother).Etti (Mrs Arpad) Plesch, Horses & Husbands: The Memoirs of Etti Plesch, Dorset: Dovecote Press, pp. 130‚Äì139 Plesch was a mentor to Italy's richest man, Gianni Agnelli, the late head of Fiat. Busson's aunt, Joanna Harcourt-Smith, was a companion of Timothy Leary, who coincidentally was married in the early 1960s to the mother of Arpad's partner, Uma Thurman.Etti (Mrs Arpad) Plesch, Horses & Husbands: The Memoirs of Etti Plesch, Dorset: Dovecote Press, pp. 130‚Äì139 Some sources have suggested that, while growing up in France, Busson made early profits selling toothpicks door-to-door (which he denies), but he was educated in France and at the Institut Le Rosey in Switzerland. He then passed through national service as a medical orderly in the French army, of which a friend said: \\"He loved the discipline of the army ‚Äì it was the making of him.\\". On being demobilised, Busson had a well-publicised relationship with the actress Farrah Fawcett and appeared in tabloid gossip columns. As he often refuses to give interviews, stories surround Busson ‚Äì the story about Fawcett is that they met on the French Riviera. The story is only partly true, in that it was perpetuated by the gossip columnist \\"Taki\\" as a sort of in-joke: Taki knew Busson's mother, who was friends with Fawcett. Finance career Busson entered the world of hedge funds in 1986 working with Dubin Swieca. He was later employed as a marketing representative for Paul Tudor Jones's fund Tudor Investments. In 1991, Busson founded the EIM Group to provide fund-of-fund management services to the growing institutional market for hedge funds. On 8 December 2008, EIM Group was reported as being a victim of Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme. In 1994 he was accused of money laundering working for the Ben Ladin bank in Geneva managing hedge funds for the Ben Ladin brothers prior the attacks in New York. He did not deny being a hedge fund manager in the British Virgin Island; he was at some point arrested and questioned by the FBI to trace funds for Al Qaeda Saudi terrorism networks . In December 2013, Busson merged his EIM group with Swiss listed investment company Gottex Fund Management Holdings. In July 2015, Busson was named the next executive chairman of Gottex Fund Management for the interim, following Joachim Gottschalk stepping down from the position and finding a permanent executive chairman. Charity Busson is a proponent of \\"venture philanthropy\\", which seeks to multiply the effectiveness of charitable pursuits by applying to them the same management practices which are used in business ventures. He is a founding trustee of the children's charity ARK (Absolute Return for Kids) and serves as chairman of its board of directors. Busson held the post of Chairman since the charity's inception. He stepped down from that position in 2009 but remains a member of the Board as founding chairman, and as chairman of ARK US. ARK raises charitable contributions from the hedge fund industry for children who are victims of abuse, disability, illness and poverty. ARK finances and manages projects aimed at transforming the lives of children in Eastern Europe, South Africa and the UK through education and healthcare. The annual Ark Dinner hosted by Busson sees a range of high-profile individuals attend the event to raise money for the charity. Previous years have seen the likes of Bill Clinton (2006), Queen Rania of Jordan (2010) and in 2011 the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge took the limelight as Prince William announced a joint venture by the Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry and the Ark charity. Its activities include funding treatment for AIDS victims in Africa, taking children out of care in Bulgaria and Romania and developing educational opportunities for disadvantaged children in India.Walsh, Katie (2008-05-18). \\"Arpad Busson, a hedge fund 'hippy'\\".

They have two sons together: Arpad Flynn Busson, known as Flynn (born February 1998 in New York City), and Aurelius Cy Andrea Busson (born February 2003 in London). The family lived together in London until Busson and Macpherson's separation in July 2005. Busson began dating American actress Uma Thurman in 2007 and they announced their engagement in June 2008. In December 2009, it was reported that the two had ended their engagement, but they reconciled and dated soon after their daughter's birth. Busson and Thurman have one daughter together, Rosalind Arusha Arkadina Altalune Florence Thurman-Busson, known as Luna (born July 2012 in Boston, MA). The couple called off the engagement for the second time in April 2014. In January 2017, Thurman and Busson began a custody battle to get custody of their daughter.

In 2011, Clallam Transit opened a new, $15.4 million transit center in downtown Port Angeles. Clallam Transit debuted its \\"Strait Shot\\" intercity bus route in June 2017, connecting Port Angeles to the Bainbridge Island ferry terminal and other points in Kitsap County.

History Conversion of the N-620 to autov√≠a standard began in the mid-1980s, when the section between Palencia and Valladolid was upgraded to dual carriageway with same-level junctions. During the 1990s, the Burgos - Palencia and Valladolid - Salamanca sections were upgraded in a similar manner, but with grade-separated junctions and slip roads; the junctions on the Palencia - Valladolid section were improved accordingly at a similar time. The A-62 designation was introduced in 2003, as part of the general renumbering of Spanish autov√≠as. The section between Salamanca and Ciudad Rodrigo was built during 2003 and 2004, and the section between Ciudad Rodrigo and Fuentes de O√±oro during 2008.

First aired on September 12, 1975, the series' first 60 minute episode (double the normal time) was most notable for its off-screen departure of the character of Captain Trapper John McIntyre (played by Wayne Rogers), and his replacement by the freshly drafted Captain B.J. Hunnicutt (played by Mike Farrell). \\"Welcome to Korea\\" features the first depiction of the 4077th MASH following the death of former unit commander Lieutenant Colonel Henry Blake (played by McLean Stevenson), and with Major Frank Burns (played by Larry Linville) in charge. Another change of command is previewed, in the form of a short appearance by Harry Morgan as Colonel Sherman T. Potter; he would be fully introduced in the following episode, \\"Change of Command\\". The episode, which was written by Everett Greenbaum, Jim Fritzell, and series creator Larry Gelbart and directed by Gene Reynolds, won two Emmy awards in 1976: \\"Outstanding Directing in a Comedy Series\\" for Reynolds, and \\"Outstanding Achievement in Film Editing for Entertainment Programming in a Comedy Series\\". After the joint departures of Stevenson and Rogers, one third of the original cast, after the series' third season, there was a great deal of uncertainty about the direction and future for the series; \\"Welcome to Korea\\" was notable for beginning a generalized move for the series away from a dark comedy to a dramedy. Plot synopsis Hawkeye Pierce returns to the 4077th after a week's R&R; in Tokyo, only to find that Trapper John McIntyre has been discharged from the Army and is on his way back to the US. Trapper had left camp shortly before Hawkeye's return, without leaving him a goodbye note. Frank Burns (now commanding officer in the wake of Henry Blake's death) and Margaret Houlihan anticipate the chance to mold Trapper's replacement, Captain B.J. Hunnicutt, into their version of the ideal Army officer. After Frank denies Hawkeye's request to leave camp and find Trapper in order to say goodbye, Radar O'Reilly gets permission to pick up B.J. at the airfield in Seoul, Trapper's first stop on his way home. Defying Frank's refusal, Hawkeye pressures Radar into taking him along. At the airfield, Hawkeye becomes disheartened over the fact that he has missed Trapper by ten minutes. Radar finds B.J. and introduces the two surgeons to one another; when they get ready to leave, though, they find their jeep missing. After a few drinks and an uneasy encounter with a colonel in the officers' club, they steal a general's jeep and start back toward the 4077th. During the drive, the three stop upon finding a pair of Korean girls probing a wheat field with long poles to check for land mines, while their father watches from the edge. Hawkeye berates the man for putting his daughters in danger just before one of them triggers a mine and is wounded. Radar rushes into the field to bring her out, ignoring shouts to stop from Hawkeye and B.J., and leads her sister to safety as well. After the three drop the family off at a local hospital, the jeep blows a tire. While changing it, they find themselves being shot at in a sudden guerrilla attack, but escape with no damage beyond a few bullet holes in the vehicle. They soon encounter an Army patrol that comes under attack by enemy artillery fire, leaving several wounded. As Hawkeye and B.J. work to help the casualties, B.J. finds one man dead and vomits upon seeing the extent of his wounds. Their last stop is at Rosie's Bar, just outside camp, where Hawkeye buys B.J. a drink to help settle his nerves as Radar enjoys his usual grape Nehi. Hawkeye describes the doctors' work at the camp and its general atmosphere, only for two other customers to start fighting and smash the group's table. Some time later, a drunken Hawkeye and B.J. stumble out of the bar and Radar drives them to camp. Frank and Margaret are appalled at their disheveled appearance and B.J.'s greeting to Frank: \\"What say you, ferret- face?\\" Hawkeye and B.J. collapse in gales of hysterical laughter. Later, Frank is arrested for driving the jeep that the three stole from the airfield. The episode ends with a roll call of the series' main cast and the arrival of Colonel Sherman Potter, newly assigned as the camp's commanding officer. Radar, shirtless and sunbathing, is greatly embarrassed once he realizes that Potter is standing right in front of him, having told Potter to \\"stick that horn in your ear\\" after Potter blows his jeep's horn to get Radar's attention.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed April 27, 2011 tributary of the Etowah River in the U.S. state of Georgia in the United States. The Little River is located mostly in Cherokee County, and forms the jagged part of the Cherokee/Fulton (formerly Cherokee/Milton) county line, and part of the more recent Milton city limit. The river flows generally from east to west, and divides the Woodstock area to the south and Holly Springs area to the north. Its largest tributary is Noonday Creek, a stream which flows north out of Cobb and through Cherokee County, and now also empties directly into the lake. The confluence with the Etowah River is now submerged beneath Lake Allatoona. The river begins as a small stream between Free Home and Holbrook, just west of the Cherokee/Forsyth county line and just south of Georgia State Route 20 (SR 20), along Free Home Road. It flows south-southwest, crossing Free Home Highway (SR 372), then roughly paralleling Birmingham Road (also SR 372) to the road's west. After passing through Almond Lake (where it receives a tributary from the north), and picking-up another tributary from the east- northeast, it becomes part of the county line, except for a small section entirely on Fulton/Milton side between Clarity Road and Hickory Flat Highway (SR 140), which may have been a former route for the river. There are also other places where the line diverges slightly to the west side of the river. Just before the Ansley Golf Club at Settindown Creek, the county line diverges due south, and the river continues west. After Trickum Road, it meanders generally northwest, meeting Rubes Creek and Mill Creek at the same point, just before Canton Highway (Main Street in Woodstock) at the north end of J.J. Biello Park. Continuing northwest, it passes Rope Mill Park just before crossing Interstate 575, and begins to widen into the lake just before meeting Toonigh Creek. Soon after, it meets the Noonday Creek arm of the lake, then widens and again narrows before meeting the Blankets Creek arm. It jogs southwest and the north again to meet Rose Creek, widening and narrowing again at Little River Landing. Just after this, it ends into the Etowah River, the largest arm of the lake. Bell's Ferry was located on Bells Ferry Road, and took traffic going between Marietta and Canton (the Cobb and Cherokee county seats) over the river between Oak Grove and Sixes. This is now the point that informally divides the river from main part of the lake, and now has a small marina named for the river at the Little River Landing. There is also a boat ramp and parking lot maintained by the United States Army Corps of Engineers.

She was played by Eileen Davidson from November 4, 1996 to April 8, 1998, and again in 2014 and 2017. Susan is the eccentric mother of Elvis \\"EJ\\" DiMera, and once acted as Kristen Blake's doppelganger. In November 2011, it was announced that Brynn Thayer would take over the role of Susan, since Davidson was committed to The Young and the Restless. Thayer made her brief one-off appearance as Susan on December 7, 2011. In January 2014, it was announced that Davidson would be returning to Days for a three-month story arc after having departed with the show in November 2013. In late September 2014, it was announced that Davidson would reprise her role as Susan Banks; her first time portraying the character in 16 years. Davidson returned to the role once again on November 2, 2017. She reprised the role of Susan's sister, Sister Mary Moira on November 21, 2017. Stacy Haiduk debuted as Susan on August 21, 2018, and departed on November 8, 2018, and appeared for a short stint the following year, last appearing in August 2019.  Casting  The decision to create a storyline in which Stefano hires a doppelganger to impersonate Kristen Blake demanded that the Days producers cast an actress who resembled Davidson. Actress, Brenda Epperson was considered for the role, an actress Davidson suggested to replace her in her role as Ashley Abbott on The Young and the Restless, due to their uncanny resemblance. Instead of casting Epperson, or any actress for that matter, Davidson suggested that she play both roles: Kristen and her alter. The show ultimately agreed. On rehearsing, Davidson related: ‚ÄúI had a tape recorder and I would read the scene and turn it off when the character I was supposed to be talked. I ran lines that way. The major way that I knew it was working was because the crew was laughing, and I was laughing, we were cracking up all the time.‚Äù The sixteen-hour work days (including Saturdays) Davidson spent on the Days set led to her developing digestive problems and insomnia. \\"They worked me to death. I was at the end of my contract, I was going to leave after the first year I played Susan. And they asked me to stay an additional year to finish off the storyline, so I did.\\" The gruel from playing upwards of five characters led to Davidson's departure from the show. Post-Days, head writer James E. Reilly called Davidson personally to apologize for working her ‚Äòinto the ground.‚Äô He told her that he couldn't help it; he felt inspired by her. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs OK. You know I volunteered to play both characters!‚Äù Davidson responded. In 2011, Days was unable to obtain Davidson, who was working on The Young and the Restless at the time, to reprise the role of Susan. A recast was made with actress Brynn Thayer filling in. Thayer was asked to research the character by watching old clips of Davidson as Susan on YouTube. The show decided to show only the back of Thayer's head as Susan, who takes a phone call from Salem. Per Davidson's agreement in 2012 to return to the soap, a stipulation was included in her contract: Lisa Williams, who acted as her double in her mid-90s Days stint, would be re-hired if need be. Davidson returned to the soap under the assumption that she would be portraying Susan Banks, with just a little bit of Kristen DiMera. Ultimately, Banks would never reappear. However, in September 2013, a tribute of sorts was made to the late James E. Reilly when Kristen, who needs to go undercover, uses Susan's teeth as a disguise. Davidson had taken Susan's teeth with her before leaving the soap in 1998. Prior to her 2014 return, Davidson was alerted that her storyline would include Susan Banks. \\"They told me, but they also knew that I was up for it.\\" Lisa Williams returned as Davidson's double. Davidson reprised her role in November 2017. In 2017, head writer Ron Carlivati discussed the decision behind having Susan Banks being responsible for Will Horton's disappearance and resurrection, stating: \\"When we went to explore who might have a motivation to initiate Will's disappearance or Will's death, Susan came to mind, and we came up with a story that would require [Eileen Davidson] involved.\\" Carlivati admitted his reluctance to this decision, due to Davidson's commitment to The Young and the Restless, even considering a recast for the role, however, deemed that \\"trickier\\". Davidson announced that her scenes became a collaborative effort as Carlivati was unfamiliar with Susan and was relying on others to fill him in ‚Äì \\"But who better than, you know, the person that played her? [...] [Ron] was very open to hearing my input, and when I thought that it was maybe too broad, he would let me change it or cut it or whatever I needed to do. It‚Äôs easy to write Susan broad, and it's easy to play her broad. So it's always, like, trying to pull it back, but also showing the flavor of her personality.\\" On August 17, 2018, it was announced that Stacy Haiduk had been cast as Susan; she made her first appearance as Susan on August 21, 2018.  Development  While James E. Reilly created the character, Davidson was the driving force behind the character's personality. ‚ÄúSusan was supposed to be insecure from a small town, not very worldly, basically kind of ignorant. She had an innocence. I based a lot of it on innocence, not necessarily ignorance. But she was very intelligent in a certain way. She was good at getting what she wanted.‚Äù Davidson would have a lot of input into all of the characters she portrayed, including wardrobe and hairstyles. Reilly added Susan's obsession with Elvis Presley. On Susan's voice, Davidson states: \\"For the voice, I just went up a couple of octaves and threw in a Southern accent. It was easy.\\" Besides the characters Kristen and Susan Banks, Davidson would go on to play an assortment of Susan's family members: Sister Mary Moira (a nun), Thomas Banks, and Penelope Kent.  Storylines  = 1996‚Äì1998 = In August 1996, Kristen is hospitalized after an explosion kills her mother and she miscarries her child. Stefano soon reappears in Salem and hires Kristen's lookalike Susan Banks to carry a child that Kristen would raise as her and John's. With the help of her father and Peter, Kristen fakes her pregnancy. When Susan goes into labor, Kristen disguised as a nurse is forced to watch as John marries Susan, believing she is really Kristen. Kristen gets custody of the child long enough to name him John Black, Jr. and Susan soon returns to claim her child and husband. Kristen enlists Vivian Alamain (Louise Sorel) and Ivan in keeping Susan locked in a secret room but Marlena puts the pieces together and Kristen is forced to lock her away. When Susan discovers the truth, sick of Kristen's manipulations she locks Kristen inside the room and attempts to marry John until Laura Horton (Jamie Lyn Bauer) confronts her at the wedding. After being rejected by John due to her scheming, Kristen's failed attempt to kill Marlena lands her in jail. After being released on bail, she attempts suicide after hearing about John and Marlena's engagement. She then reveals Marlena's presumed dead husband, Roman Brady (now Josh Taylor); John and Kristen then pretend to marry to keep Roman from becoming suspicious. When John and Stefano ruin her attempt to get back Susan's son, Elvis (a.k.a. John, Jr.), she reveals that Roman and Marlena have been seeing one another. Kristen's attempt to force Susan into giving the child back ends with the death of Susan's identical sister, Penelope Kent. Fearing she'll be charged with murder, Kristen pretends to be Susan and is forced to marry Susan's boyfriend, Edmund Crumb (Adam Caine). In the meantime, \\"Susan\\" and Edmund go on a honeymoon and Laura is arrested for Kristen's murder. Edmund admits to Kristen's \\"murder\\" and they soon run into the real Susan who explains that Kristen sold her into a harem; it is then revealed that the dead person was Susan's other sibling, Penelope Kent. To get revenge against Kristen, Susan exchanges her freedom for Kristen to be sold to the harem. = 2011, 2014 = In December 2011, Bo (Peter Reckell) and Hope (Kristian Alfonso) come across an ornament owned by Alice Horton. Tucked inside it they find a letter written by Susan asking Alice for help with Elvis who was sick and needed a doctor. The letter is to be extended to Stefano. Bo finds Susan's phone number in England and Hope decides to call her. Hope inquires as to the significance of the letter to Susan (Brynn Thayer) who becomes nervous that Elvis is in trouble. Susan inadvertently reveals that Alice helped Elvis, and Stefano visited her after Elvis was better. Realizing that she's said too much, Susan pretends that the phone line has a bad connection and hangs up. Susan (Davidson) turns up on the DiMera Mansion doorstep, having come to visit EJ, as she has had a premonition that he's in grave danger. She attempts to convince him to return to England with her. Susan also doesn't think that Sami (Alison Sweeney) is the right woman for him to be with; she sees her as nothing but trouble. She reveals why she allowed Stefano, who she says is evil, to raise him: she and Edmund couldn't provide the life that he could. Susan refers to EJ as her \\"first born,\\" suggesting that she's had more children after him. Susan is left alone in the mansion and decides to pay John a visit in the hospital. She goes to open the door to leave and is greeted by Kristen, who is standing there. The two trade barbs; Susan rushes out after Kristen gets Stefano on the phone. Susan visits an unconscious John in the hospital. She talks about their almost wedding and before going, leaves a photo from the nuptials. EJ later is shot and presumed to have died. = 2017‚Äì2019 = The hunt for Will Horton (Chandler Massey) leads Sami, John and Marlena to a house in Memphis occupied by Roger (John Enos III), an Elvis impersonator, and Susan Banks. While toting a rifle and standing in a bedroom whose walls are adorned with the initials \\"EJ\\", Susan reveals that she paid Dr. Wilhelm Rolf to revive Will as part of a revenge plot against Sami. Susan holds Sami responsible for EJ's death; it's caused her to spiral out of control as well as ended her marriage to Edmund. Susan is adamant that Rolf's revival didn't work. However, Will, identifying himself as EJ, is found alive and working in a bar in Memphis. Friends and family try desperately to convince him that he's been brainwashed by his \\"mother\\" Susan and to return to Salem. When Roger confirms that Susan isn't Will's biological mother, Susan suffers a mental breakdown and is hospitalized. Will decides to return to Salem to learn about his former life. Will keeps tabs on Susan's progress through Roger, learning that she's been institutionalized and that on New Year's Eve she's suffered a relapse after receiving a visitor in her hospital room. Months later, a recovered Susan (Stacy Haiduk) arrives back in Salem on Will's doorstep to make amends. She also turns up at Marlena's bachelorette party and manages to invite herself to Marlena and John Black's upcoming wedding. Susan mentions to Marlena that she was visited by Kristen, who is very much alive, in the hospital. Marlena convinces Susan that Kristen is dead and that she was probably just hallucinating from the drugs that the hospital had administrated. Kristen (Haiduk) catches Susan alone and forces her at knife-point to switch places with her so she can attend the wedding undetected. After the wedding, Susan stays with Victor (John Aniston) and Maggie (Suzanne Rogers). She is determined to give the doll she made (an exact replica of Marlena) as a wedding gift to Marlena once she's recovered in the hospital. Susan reveals that she used her own hair for the doll. Susan has a premonition that EJ is still alive. Sami tracks down a patient in a secret facility Kristen has been running with Dr. Rolf in Nashville and rescues him, but not before he's severely burned. Sami uses the hair on Susan's Marlena doll as a DNA sample to find out if the man she rescued in the facility is really EJ without telling Susan. In an effort to get her out of his house, Victor tells Susan that Sami has her son. Susan discovers a bandaged man in the hospital along with the DNA test results confirming that he is indeed her son. She confronts Sami wielding a scalpel. Sami convinces Susan to agree to allow her to take EJ to Italy to a renowned clinic for burn victims, and tells Susan that she can visit. In 2019, after being double-crossed by Xander Kiriakis (Paul Telfer), Kristen, who has returned to Salem as Nicole Walker (Arianne Zucker), decides to disguise herself, once again, as Susan. Unbeknownst to Kristen, the real Susan is back in town. Susan later bumps into Kristen, still in her disguise, and pulls a gun on her. Kristen manages to convince her that she is her sister, Sister Mary Moira. Susan is later tied up by Kristen disguised as Nicole at John and Marlena's wedding anniversary party. After Kristen is unmasked in front of a roomful of guests, Susan, who's managed to untie herself, rescues Marlena from Kristen, who is holding her at gunpoint, by hitting her on the head.  Reception  Davidson's performance earned her her first Daytime Emmy Award nomination in the category of Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 1998.

It is bounded by the A27 (Brighton bypass) to the north, Hollingbury to the east and southeast, Withdean to the south and the Brighton Main Line to the west. The A23 passes through the area. History Patcham was originally a separate village that developed around the partly 12th- and 13th-century All Saints' Church. The parish of Patcham extended to and encompassed large parts of what are now adjacent suburbs, such as Withdean, Westdene, Hollingbury and Tongdean. It extended eastwards into modern-day Moulsecoomb, westwards beyond Dyke Road into Hove, and northwards across the sparsely-populated South Downs towards the parishes of Pyecombe and Ditchling. The centre of the original village, based around the church (on Church Hill) and the Old London Road ‚Äì now bypassed by the modern A23 ‚Äì is a conservation area, and several buildings are listed. Modern Patcham Sir Herbert Carden, a prominent Brighton solicitor who was mayor for three years from 1916 and served on the council from 1895 until 1941, was responsible for the boundary changes on 1 April 1928 which brought Patcham within the \\"Greater Brighton\\" area. To commemorate this, two large stone pillars, known as the \\"Pylons\\", were erected on the A23 just north of the village of Patcham, marking the new boundary line. The land around the village was mostly undeveloped at this time, but many houses were later built. Many of the estates built around the old village date from the 1930s. The Ladies Mile Estate, built around the former drove road from the village to Stanmer Park, is an example; it is separated from Hollingbury to the southeast by Carden Avenue, named after Sir Herbert. The roads around the Mackie Avenue estate (all with Scottish names) were named by the Scottish builder George Ferguson who developed the estate. He also planted the Scots pines on the Ladies Mile Open Space. Schools in Patcham Patcham High School has its roots in a school opened on 3 September 1928, as the Brighton Intermediate School, in the premises formerly occupied by the girls' secondary school (later Varndean School for Girls) in York Place. Additional rooms were used at 99 Trafalgar Street until January 1931 when the old premises of the boys' secondary school became available. All years bar the first year were then transferred to these premises. In September 1931 separate departments for boys and girls were established, and were known as the Intermediate School for Girls (later the Margaret Hardy High School for Girls,) and Intermediate School for Boys respectively. From October 1945 the boys' school was re-named the Patcham Fawcett County Secondary School for Boys. In July 1965 the Patcham County Secondary School in Warmdene Road was closed; the boys were transferred to the Patcham Fawcett County Secondary School which then became known as the Patcham Fawcett School and the girls to the Margaret Hardy County Secondary School. New premises for the school were opened in September 1965 at Ladies Mile Road, Patcham. In 1989 it amalgamated with the Margaret Hardy High School for Girls and became Patcham High School. At the time of relocation, while Patcham Fawcett was housed in new premises at the top of Ladies Mile Road, Margaret Hardy was housed in classrooms previously used by Patcham High School. Patcham First School, at the time housed in the southern part of what is now the Patcham Junior School building, relocated to brand new buildings in Highview Avenue North, permitting expansion of the junior school (briefly Patcham Middle School in the 1970s). The Windmill View estate at the top of Ladies Mile Road is built on the site of the old Patcham Fawcett School. Patcham House School, located on Old London Road, was a school for pupils aged 11-16 with complex needs. It opened in the 1860s as a National School, a church- funded initiative to provide education to the poor. The original flint building still stands today, and is included on the council's Local List of Heritage Assets. The school came under council control in 1919, and was renamed Patcham County School. Eventually the County School, having outgrown the buildings and been forced to split classes between this building, Patcham Place and Mackie Hall, relocated to its current location on the corner of Ladies Mile Road and Warmdene Road, leaving the site to be adopted by Patcham House during the 1960s. It closed in July 2018 as part of a reorganisation of Special Educational Needs provision in Brighton and Hove. Patcham Community Centre The Patcham Community Centre is run by the Patcham Community Association, which was formed in 1945. There were originally 15 groups involved, including the Patcham Communist Party, and for the first 24 years they existed without their own centre, holding meetings in the school halls in the area. At the same time Alderman Kippin (known as 'Mr Patcham') arranged for a combined community centre and youth club, each with its own suite of rooms but sharing a kitchen, to be included in the basement of a new wing of the Margaret Hardy school. After the 1989 merger of Fawcett and Margaret Hardy into Patcham High brought the boys and girls together on Warmdene Road, more space was needed. In 2003 a PFI project overhauled the school buildings and a new Community Building erected just outside the High school grounds to incorporate both the community centre and the community library. The new centre is now a hub of activity for local people, with over 40 different organisations using it, in addition to hosting many family celebrations. Places of interest in Patcham Waterhall Mill Patcham Mill is a converted windmill on high ground west of the old village (but within the former Patcham parish). Also known as Waterhall Mill and locally as Westdene Mill, it was built in 1885 and was used for 40 years. A second mill, now demolished, stood on a site near Overhill Drive and is commemorated by the street name Old Mill Close. Patcham mill on Sussex Mills website Patcham Place (Photo) was the city's Youth Hostel until September 2007. It is in the old village centre opposite the former post office, in a large area of open parkland. Below it the Brighton Main Line runs through the Patcham Tunnel. The house dates from 1558 and was originally the seat of the Shelley family.

It is an example of Hindu-Koiri Nepali architecture. It is often considered the most important model of Koiri architecture in Nepal. Fully built in bright white and constructed in an area of 4,860 sq. feet in a mixed style of Mughal and Koiri domes. It is a three- storied structure made entirely of stone and marble. All its 60 rooms are decorated with the flag of Nepal, colored glass, engravings, and paintings, with beautiful lattice windows and turrets. According to legends and epics, King Janak ruled this area (called Videha) during the Ramayana period. His daughter Janaki (Sita), during her swyambar, had chosen Lord Rama as her husband, and become the queen of Ayodhya. Their marriage ceremony had occurred in the nearby temple which is also called vivaha mandap. The site was designated as a UNESCO tentative site in 2008.https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5261/ History The mandir is popularly known as the Nau Lakha Mandir (meaning \\"nine lakhs\\"). The cost for the construction of the temple was about the same amount of money: rupees nine lakhs or nine hundred thousand, hence the name. Queen Vrisha Bhanu of Tikamgarh built the temple in 1910 AD. In 1657, a golden statue of the Goddess Sita was found at the very spot, and Sita is said to have lived there. The legend said it that it was built on the holy site where Sannyasi Shurkishordas had found the images of Goddess Sita. In fact, Shurkishordas was the founder of modern Janakpur and the great saint and poet who preached about the Sita Upasana (also called Sita Upanishad) philosophy. Legend has claimed it that King Janak(Seeradhwaj) performed the worship of Shiva-Dhanus on this site. , the temple is reported to have partly collapsed from the earthquake in April 2015. Pilgrimage Every year, thousands of pilgrims from Nepal, India, Sri Lanka, and other countries visit Ram Janaki Temple to worship Lord Ram and Sita. Many worshippers visit the temple during the festivals of Ram Nawami, Vivaha Panchami, Dashain and Tihar.

Scar is introduced as a villain who targets alchemists working for the state military from the fictional country of Amestris. Scar hails from the region of Ishval whose people were almost exterminated in a previous civil war against the state military, most notably their alchemists. His alias is derived from the prominent X-shaped scar that decorates his brow with his birth name being unknown. As the series continues, Scar's backstory is further explored and he questions his motives, eventually joining the side of the Amestrian State military. Scar was created by Arakawa in order to represent the continuous encounter that happened between people from Hokkaido and the Ainu. Therefore, she regards Scar as a complex character as his hatred spanned from the Ishval's civil war. Similarly, his character was received positively by publications from manga and anime, who find him as an atypical villain in the series. Creation and concept The major conflict between Scar and the State Alchemists is based on Hiromu Arakawa's own background when she lived in Hokkaido, as her ancestors conquered the land belonging to the Ainu people, but some of them were Ainu themselves. This is represented in Scar's revenge against State Alchemists as he ironically uses alchemy like them in order kill them despite being a taboo for his religion. As a result, Arakawa comments that rather than being a common \\"evil antagonist\\", Scar's character resulted from several catastrophes that occurred in the Ishvalan Civil War and such a label should be avoided. When illustrating characters, Arakawa states that Scar became one of the easiest ones to design. Appearances =In Fullmetal Alchemist= J. Michael Tatum is the second English voice of Scar, Tatum replaced Clarke following his hiatus from voicework and was experienced as he had replaced Clarke as Victor Hilsire in Gunslinger Girl. Scar is introduced in the series as a serial killer who targets alchemists working for the state military from the country of Amestris as revenge for their involvement in Ishvalan civil war, which caused the death of several of his comrades. During this war, a state alchemist named Solf J. Kimblee attacked Scar and his friends and family. With the last of his strength, Scar's brother attached his own arm, through means of alchemy, to Scar. This gives Scar the ability to use alchemy despite being a taboo for his people's religion, as Ishbalans believe that only God has the right to create. However, instead of fully transmuting what he comes in contact with, he simply decomposes it into individual elements, completely obliterating the object. When Scar awakens after the incident and discovers his brother's arm attached to his own, he kills the doctors treating him, Winry Rockbell's parents, in a blind rage. Using his new ability, Scar tries to kill the state alchemist Edward Elric in Eastern Headquarters, but escapes upon being ambushed by the military. Knowing that the Elric brothers are headed to the first branch library, he goes there to ambush them, but he is found by creatures known as the homunculi. Retreating from them, Scar then joins with the former military lieutenant Yoki and a young immigrant named May Chang to go to Central City to continue his revenge. He finds the Elric brothers, unaware that it is part of their plot to lure out the homunculi. During this encounter, Edward reveals Scar's involvement in the deaths of Winry's parents, unaware that Winry is present at the time, and which Scar confirms. When Edward and his brother Alphonse try to beat him while capturing a homunculus, Scar is saved by May. He agrees to help May find her pet panda in thanks for saving him. Scar and May end up stumbling upon the Elrics in the homunculi's lair, where Edward reveals the fact that they sparked the Ishbal rebellion. As he escapes, he finds Dr. Tim Marcoh, a state alchemist who participated in the Ishbalan war, who asks Scar to kill him as he is being used by the homunculi. Scar agrees to fulfill Marcoh's wish in return for the true story behind the Ishbal Massacre. After learning the truth behind his brother's research involving alchemy, Scar decides to spare Marcoh's life to help him learn more. Scar's group makes their way to the North where the secrets of his brother's research are hidden. During the journey, Scar continues to be the target of the state military and is ultimately captured by the Elric brothers. When they discover that Kimblee is nearby, searching for Scar, Winry proposes that she be used as a \\"hostage\\" by Scar to provide cover for the Elric brothers, and to secure herself from Central's grasp. In the end, he and his group, together with Winry, go through an unused mine tunnel under the city. After succeeding in their escape, Scar joins forces with the Ishbalans as well as Edward's group in order to strike on the corrupted State Military controlled by the homunculi. While attacking their base, Scar fights the homunculus King Bradley. After defeating him, a severely wounded Scar uses the last of his strength to activate the transmutation circle that the Ishbalans secretly made around the city to enhance the alchemists' powers thanks to his brother's notes and stop the homunculi's leader. Following this, General Olivier Mira Armstrong saves Scar's life to aid the military in rebuilding the Ishbalan nation. Scar agrees, deciding to give up his birthname and his nickname. =2003 anime= Targeting Edward Elric, Scar is found by the homunculi, recognizing Lust as his brother's deceased lover. Scar barely survives as his wounds are tended to at an Ishbalan refugee camp. When the Elrics break into the military's fifth laboratory, Scar follows them, confronting the homunculi again. In the laboratory, after seeing Edward refuse the homunculi's offer to obtain a Philosopher's Stone by killing the prisoners held within the laboratory, Scar interrupts them to give the Elrics time to escape. Scar returns to the refugee camp occupied by the remaining Ishbalans, only for it to be attacked by mercenaries posing as the State Military. After he and the Elrics save an Ishbalan child from them, they reach an uneasy truce. Through further study, Scar eventually comes to realize the true nature of his arm as an incomplete Philosopher's Stone. Concluding that he needs the stone to stop the action of the State Military, he travels to the war-torn desert city of Lior and inscribes a gigantic transmutation circle around the city itself. Learning of his presence there, the State Military arrives in force. Once again, Edward and Scar battle, but they are interrupted by the homunculi, where Scar stuns Lust with his brother's lover's locket, forcing Gluttony to take the unconscious Lust and retreat. Shortly after, Scar's allies Rose and Lyra appear. Scar learns from Edward how homunculi are created and weaken as well as how his brother actually created Lust when he tried to revive his lover. Later, as Kimblee leads a small army of chimeras into Lior, and with the evacuation nearly complete, Scar and Alphonse engage him in combat, which ends with Scar managing to mortally wound Kimblee at the cost of his left arm. Kimblee, however, transmutes Alphonse's body into explosive material before dying. To save him, Scar transmutes his remaining arm, and all the power and souls within it, into Alphonse's armored body. Scar uses the last of his strength to complete and activate the transmutation circle around the city, dying as the transmutation took place, and the Philosopher's Stone is completed - within Alphonse, saving his life and killing several groups of soldiers attacking Lior. Reception In each of the popularity polls made by Monthly Sh≈çnen Gangan Scar has appeared within the top 20. As a result of often sharing his spot with animals and Hiromu Arakawa's alter-ego, the character has been shown angered after the end of the polls, to the point of killing Arakawa. Critical response to Scar's character and development has generally been positive. DVD Talk writer Bobby Cooper initially noted Scar's story to be one of the series' themes against religion, but concluded that it was not as he was just using his religion to justify his murders. Todd Douglass Jr. from the same site called him \\"a deep character with a tragic past\\" as despite being a murderer, he comes to share the same points of view from the Elric brothers across the series. Holly Ellingwood from Active Anime noted Scar to be \\"a character so much deeper than just a foil for the brothers\\" [Edward and Alphonse Elric] due to how along the series it is shown his backstory and it is explained why is he determined to kill all the State Alchemists unlike other villains. Mania Entertainment's Chris Beveridge celebrated Scar's introduction in the second anime series Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, remarking that \\"we learn a good deal of recent history in a short time that paints a picture of exactly what‚Äôs going on\\". While reviewing the first anime's second DVD, Sean Broestl from Anime News Network (ANN) was curious to who is such character, as he is shown in the first episodes but he is never introduced. However, he was looking forward to seeing his introduction and how he would affect the Elric brothers. His second fight against the Elric brothers in the manga and his confrontation with Winry Rockbell were praised by Sakura Eries from Mania who found the former to have its \\"own surprise moments\\" while the latter had her \\"on the verge of tears\\". Carlo Santos from ANN also praised Scar's fights in following volumes from the manga, commenting that they contain \\"lots of exhilarating action and creative fighting moves\\".

The cones are in the lee of the Lillooet Icecap and sit astride a group of passes between the Bridge River, which flows W-E to their south, and the Lord River, which flows north to the Taseko Lakes in the Chilcotin District. Geology The Bridge River Cones consist of small trachybasaltic and basaltic eruptive centers. Sham Hill (), a high steep-sided volcanic plug, is the oldest volcano in the field with a potassium-argon date of one million years. The plug is approximately wide and its bare glaciated surface, strewn with glacial erratics, consists of large subhorizontal columns formed within the central conduit of an eroded stratovolcano. The Salal Glacier volcanic complex (), with a potassium-argon date of 0.97 to 0.59 million years, contains subaerial tephra and thin scoriaceous flows in the upper part of the pile are surrounded by ice-ponded flows up to thick. Tuber Hill (), a small basaltic stratovolcano with a potassium-argon date of 0.6 million years, was constructed on the Bridge River upland when neighboring valleys were filled by ice. Where distal flows violated on the glaciers a marginal meltwater lake was created in which less than of interbedded hyaloclastite, debris flows, and lacustrine tuff were deposited. The youngest volcanic rocks in the Bridge River volcanic field lie east of Tuber Hill and are remnants of valley-filling basalt flows. The age of these valley-filling basalt flows is unknown but the presence of unconsolidated glacial until under the flows suggest they are less than 1,500 years old.

In another prominent case, which occurred the previous year, Durkan convinced a federal magistrate to deny the United Kingdom's request that Desmond Mackin - accused of shooting a British soldier- be extradited to British custody. Born in Bohola, County Mayo, Durkan immigrated to the United States in 1947, aged 17. He stayed with his uncle, William O'Dwyer, the eldest brother of his mother, Mary. \\"Bill\\" O'Dwyer was the Mayor of New York City at the time, while his uncle, Paul O'Dwyer, was an influential activist who would later become president of the New York City Council. \\"The kid\\" was quickly whisked away to a small apartment in the Bronx to earn his way.

He, along with Paul's son Brian, were the senior partners at the time of his death. In addition to representing accused members of the IRA he would also practice malpractice and negligence law, and - towards the twilight of his career- indulge in political campaigns aimed at legitimizing the cause of the new IRA within American political circles by lobbying the government on behalf of Irish-American republicans and Irish nationalists; he was ultimately unsuccessful by the 1990s when a client Joe Doherty was deported in 1992 after 10 years of litigation. He died on November 16, 2006, aged 76, in Greenwich, Connecticut from complications from RA- induced pulmonary fibrosis.

He was played, on a recurring basis, by Darrell Thomas Utley from 1988 to 1990, and by Jim Lunsford in 2006 and 2007. Character's background Benjy is the deaf son of Stefano DiMera and Ellen Hawk. Stefano had his mother, Ellen, killed. Steve and Kayla found Benjy on their honeymoon and nearly adopted him. However he ended up living with his maternal grandfather, Orion, in Europe. Years later, Benjy would make a brief and surprising return to Salem. Steve and Kayla Johnson were poisoned and recovering at Salem Hospital. Still unable to remember the past, Steve found himself torn between loyalty to Kayla and helping her recover, and his new feelings for Billie Reed. Steve noticed a stranger in the halls outside his recovery room; that stranger turned out to be Benjy. He had heard of the poisoning and came back to help Steve and Kayla, who were so nice to him so many years ago. Before leaving again, Benjy helped Steve remember a Christmas memory from years ago when Benjy was just a small boy. This gave Steve hope some of his other memories might return as well. Benjy then returned to Europe. Not longer after, his grandfather Orion died. Benjy later returned to Salem with his wife, Sonja, and they had dinner with Steve and Kayla. After dinner, Benjy gave Steve the devil card, kissed him on both cheeks, and left. It was revealed Benjy was threatened into giving Steve the tarot card by his father Stefano DiMera and half brother EJ DiMera under the threat they would kill his wife and child if he didn't. Benjy and his family moved to Salem permanently. He was then drugged and kidnapped in order to be a liver donor for Stefano. Eventually, a homeless man found him and he was saved from dying. While recovering from his injuries, Benjy attended the mock funeral of Stefano and fired a gun multiple times into the casket. Benjy was disarmed and taken back to the hospital where it was assumed by those around him, he remained.

The film deals with the consequences of business monopolization and globalization. Filmed in New York City and Puerto Rico, the film was first shown at the Sundance Film Festival. After a limited run in New York, it was shown at various festivals in America and Europe. Plot summary Some time in the future United States, a being from another planet (Abracos) arrives on Earth and takes human form. In voiceover, Jack Bell (Bill Sage), an advertising executive, explains how his ideas came to bring the \\"triple M\\" into power and reduce human beings to mere consumers, pawns of the corporation. Flash- forwards show his visit to a \\"gun boutique\\" to buy a pistol, and a suicide attempt in his car. The innovative idea Jack contributes to Triple M is that, since sexually active people are the most active consumers, people will record each of their sexual encounters as an economic transaction. This will increase their desirability rating, their value as sexual commodities, and therefore also their credit rating. Because of its direct relation to one's credit rating and buying power, insurance policies covering a person's sexual desirability are available. To give himself an alibi during an action he planned for the counter-revolution, Jack attempts to hook up with his co- worker Cecile (Sabrina Lloyd) but loses heart, leading the insurance company to investigate why this happened. Jack claims that he has been unable to have successful sex since his wife drowned in the ocean. The insurance agent decides it's not Cecile's fault and her premium remains the same, while Jack's is raised. Meanwhile, the planned counter-revolutionary assault on Triple M headquarters is somehow thwarted, and the counter-revolutionaries go on the run. The news broadcasts claim two people were killed, and the police start a manhunt for the perpetrators. By chance Cecile meets up with William, teenage leader in the counter-revolution, who takes her to a place where people have sex just because it feels good. Cecile is arrested for having non-economic sex, now criminalized under Triple M, and sentenced to \\"two years hard labor... teaching high school\\". The classes are taught through virtual reality helmets, while the students are all legally armed and drugged daily with anti- anxiety medications. Coincidentally, William is one of Cecile's students. Cecile reads Henry David Thoreau's book Walden, passed secretly to her by William, and is inspired to join the counter-revolution. Meanwhile, Jack drives to the beach where his wife apparently drowned. He overdoses on pills and vodka, but loses consciousness before he can shoot himself. William finds him, thinks him dead, and takes the pistol to continue his counter- revolutionary activities. When Jack regains consciousness he finds the girl from the planet Monday (named after its discoverer, Vincent Monday, explains Jack in voice-over) arising from the water. He secretes her at home and teaches her how to fit into human society. The girl calls herself \\"Nobody;\\" she has arrived to retrieve an earlier \\"immigrant\\" from her planet. Several coincidences and adventures later, including a threesome between Jack, Cecile, and Nobody, a police raid on a dress boutique, and Nobody prostituting herself to Cecile's high school principal to get Cecile released from jail, Nobody is convinced her mission is a failure and she decides to go home. Jack, it turns out, is also an \\"immigrant\\" from that planet, and has tried and failed to go home. They proceed to the ocean, where the girl walks into the water and disappears. Jack says he doesn't know if she made it or not. Reception Stephen Holden, writing for The New York Times, opines that \\"Like so many science fiction fantasies, Hal Hartley's new film begins with a clever satirical premise, then stumbles all over itself trying to tell a coherent, original story.\\" Peter Hanson, writing for Film Threat, called it \\"A profoundly unnecessary movie.\\" In comparison to Hartley's earlier work, this film and No Such Thing \\"may have lacked the impact of his first features, [but] they certainly demonstrate that Hartley is a director still unafraid to take apart and reassemble the medium.\\"Jason Wood, Talking Movies: Contemporary World Filmmakers in Interview London: Wallflower Press (2006): 104 Availability The region 1 DVD release came out on November 7, 2006 and was made available to Netflix customers to rent.

It took place on 19 November 2006 when suspected LTTE carders exploded an Improvised explosive device (an IED) targeting a military truck killing five Sri Lanka Army soldiers. Five students of the Thandikulam Agriculture Farm School were also killed in either the explosion or the subsequent gunfight that followed. , investigations are ongoing to ascertain the cause of their deaths.  Incident  The incident happened when a bomb exploded targeting a Sri Lanka Army truck transporting military personnel, and it was followed by gun fire at Thandikulam, Vauniya on 19 November 2006. This bomb exploded 10 meters away from Thandikulam Agriculture Farm School which is managed by the Sri Lankan Government at around 9:45 am. Sri Lanka Police and Security forces alleged that this Claymore type directional mine was placed by the LTTE, which is a rebel group banned as a terrorist organisation by 32 countries including the United States, India and the member states of the European union. But LTTE denied these allegations.  Casualties  From this incident, five Sri Lanka Army soldiers including an officer were killed along with five students consisting of four Sri Lankan Tamils, one Sri Lankan Moor. Ten more students and four soldiers in the truck were wounded in the attack.  Allegations towards responsibility  Initially the Pro rebel LTTE media placed the blame on the government saying the army had entered the Thandikulam Agriculture Farm School, lined up the uniformed hostel students and shot at them blank range after the explosion and later it was followed by the international media agencies and by the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission. But military sources denied these allegations and said, following a claymore attack on an army truck killing five soldiers, the LTTE open fired on the troops using the farm school as a shield. The dead students were caught in the crossfire.  Investigation  After the regional magistrate completed the initial investigation, he handed over the evidence and further investigation to the CID. The CID teams investigating the massacre of five students have arrested a police constable and a soldier as inquiries revealed the complicity of the police constable attached to the Kurumankadu Sri Lanka Police post and the soldier in a nearby bunker. According to the CID, 13 empty Type 56 cartridges have been found at the scene initially by Police and five more empty casings and two live ammunition of the same caliber were found at the scene by CID teams on 21 November. One slug has been recovered from one body, by the District Medical Officer. Evidence has revealed that soon after the explosion targeting the Army truck, a group of personnel in camouflage uniforms had opened fire at the Agriculture School students. Further investigations are still going on.

He composed it in Leipzig for New Year's Day and first performed it on 1 January 1726 as part of his third cantata cycle. The beginning of the text is based on \\"\\", Luther's German Te Deum,  History and words  Bach wrote the cantata in 1726, his third year as Thomaskantor in Leipzig, for New Year's Day, which is also the feast of the circumcision and naming of Jesus. The prescribed readings for the feast day were taken from the Epistle to the Galatians, by faith we inherit (), and from the Gospel of Luke, the Circumcision and naming of Jesus (). The cantata text is taken from a 1711 publication by Georg Christian Lehms, it centers on praise and thanksgiving without being related to the readings. The poet began with four lines from Martin Luther's German Te Deum, \\"\\" (Lord God, we praise you). The following pair of recitative and aria deal with thanks for past gifts, while a further pair deal with a prayer for further blessings. The poet did not supply a closing chorale, but Bach chose the final stanza of Paul Eber's \\"\\" (Help me to praise God's goodness) (c. 1580). Bach first performed the cantata on 1 January 1726.  Scoring and structure  The cantata in six movements is scored for three vocal soloists (alto, tenor, and bass), a four-part choir, corno da caccia, two oboes, oboe da caccia, two violins, viola, violetta (alternative in a later performance) and basso continuo.  Music  In the opening chorus the soprano and the horn present the liturgical melody of the Te Deum, whereas the lower voices move in vivid counterpoint, but also a fourth part of oboe I and violin I. The following secco recitative ends on the words \\"\\" (O, should not therefore a new song be taken up and that we sing in heated love?). Consequently, the following movement begins attacca (without a break) with the voices' \\"\\" (Let us celebrate, let us rejoice). This unusual movement combines elements of chorus and aria in a free da capo form. The first section is dominated by the chorus, the middle section by the bass. Musicologist Julian Mincham points out that it is \\"an unusual and imaginative combination of aria and chorus\\" and likens it to the interaction between a pastor and his flock. A second secco recitative leads to a tender aria which was accompanied by an obbligato oboe da caccia in 1726. In a later performance, likely in 1734, this was replaced by a \\"violetta\\", which can be a viola or a descant viola da gamba, according to Johann Gottfried Walther. The cantata closes with a four-part chorale.  Recordings  * J. S.

Plot Marcy Tizard (Janeane Garofalo) is assistant to Senator John McGlory (Jay O. Sanders) from Boston, Massachusetts. In an attempt to court the Irish-American vote in a tough re-election battle, the bumbling senator's chief of staff, Nick (Denis Leary), sends Marcy to Ireland to find McGlory's relatives or ancestors. Marcy arrives at the fictional village of Ballinagra (, literally the Town of Love) as it is preparing for the annual matchmaking festival. She attracts the attention of two rival professional matchmakers, Dermot (Milo O'Shea) and Millie (Rosaleen Linehan), as well as roguish bartender Sean (David O'Hara). The locals tolerate her genealogical search while trying to match her with various bachelors. Sean tries to woo Marcy despite her resistance to his boorish manners. After they have begun their romance, they return home to Sean's house one afternoon to find his estranged wife Moira (Saffron Burrows) waiting for them. Marcy leaves Sean, upset that he did not disclose his marriage to her. McGlory and Nick arrive in Ballinagra, although Marcy's been unable to locate any McGlory relatives. McGlory discovers Sean's wife's maiden name is Kennedy and brings her back to Boston as his fianc√©e just in time for the election, and wins by a small margin. While at the victory party, McGlory's father (Robert Mandan) reveals privately to Marcy that the family is Hungarian, not Irish. The family name had been changed at Ellis Island when they immigrated, but as they settled in Boston with its large Irish population, he never told his son their true lineage. Sean follows Marcy to Boston, and they reconcile. Reception = Box office = The film earned $1,378,930 in its first weekend and had a total gross of $3,392,080 in 705 theatres. =Critical response= Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 50% based on reviews from 32 critics, with an average rating of 5.5 out of 10 reviews. Roger Ebert gives the film 3 out of 4 stars. Ebert praises Garofalo, calling her \\"one of the most engaging actresses around\\" and admiring her balance of \\"her cynical intelligence and the warmth of her smile\\". Ebert finds the Irish centre of the film charming and says the Boston bookends are distracting. The Irish Independent notes: \\"Bad things happen whenever Hollywood and Ireland collide and this rather thin comedy is no exception\\" but say the film is helped by the central performance of Janeane Garofalo. In a 2003 interview, when asked what films from her career she was happiest with, Garofalo included The Matchmaker among the few films she mentioned. Cultural references Marcy's expectations clash with a host of colourful rural Irish characters in the tradition of such other works as The Irish R.M. Filming took place on location in the town of Roundstone, County Galway. Besides the personalities of the villagers, the film establishes a sense of place through a generous use of village scenes, the local surrounding farms and a trip to the Aran Islands, with cavorting near D√∫n Aengus. Worked into the story is a parody of Senator John Kerry's family background. His paternal grandfather was from Eastern Europe, picking a new name once arriving in America and blending into the Irish Catholic community in Boston. Music Irish music is heard frequently throughout, both as background music and in scenes where it is performed live as when an Irishman (Vincent Walsh) competes for a kiss from Marcy with his sean n√≥s rendition of \\"Raglan Road\\". The soundtrack features \\"Haunted\\" by Shane MacGowan and Sin√©ad O'Connor. \\"Irish Heartbeat\\" by Van Morrison and The Chieftains plays during the end credits. World Party's 1997 song \\"She's the One\\" is also included on the soundtrack.

He was played by Brian Baumgartner. Kevin's counterpart in the UK series is Keith Bishop. Kevin is one of the few major-minor characters in The Office to be directly based on a character from the British original version. He is based on Keith Bishop, who shares Kevin's lack of communication skills, musical interest, and large size. Kevin is a part of the accounting department at Dunder Mifflin Scranton. The other accountants are Oscar Martinez and Angela Martin. Slate magazine named the character as one of the reasons they were looking forward to the return of the show in fall 2007. Biography Kevin is of Irish descent as stated in \\"The Podcast‚Äù and did not grow up around Scranton, as stated in \\"The Delivery\\". Kevin received a job as an accountant at Dunder Mifflin after applying for a job in the warehouse because Michael Scott had \\"a feeling about him.\\"\\"Scott's Tots Kevin was engaged to a woman named Stacey, who has a daughter named Abby. Stacey was the fourth woman to whom Kevin proposed, but the first to say yes, and he was very happy, though he secretly considered her a second choice to one of the other women, Melissa Riley. Little is known about Stacey, although she may have been seen as the woman who was Kevin's date in the second-season episode \\"The Dundies\\".\\"The Dundies\\" He has a sister who lives nearby him as shown in a deleted scene from Andy's Play, as well as a mother who recently has become incapable of living by herself and needs to be put in a home. Kevin is typically quite subdued, although he is known for making blunt or offensive comments regarding the other employees, such as Angela Martin, in \\"Conflict Resolution (The Office)\\" Angela makes a claim that he made sexually suggestive comments to her. He hints toward unbecoming Internet habits, most likely pornography, as alluded to in the episodes \\"E-mail Surveillance\\", \\"Take Your Daughter to Work Day\\" and \\"Whistleblower\\". He is very concerned about the e-mail surveillance uncovering the contents of his hard drive and flees an interview with the cameras to ensure that his fianc√©e's daughter had not found the same content.\\"Take Your Daughter to Work Day\\" When Nick, the I.T. guy for Sabre has to examine everyone's computers, this prompts Kevin to sprint for his computer in front of everyone. But Nick confirms that he already went through Kevin's computer, causing Kevin to say that he just likes running.\\"Whistleblower\\" Kevin plays drums and is also the lead singer in a local tribute band called Scrantonicity. The group initially was a Steve Miller Band tribute called \\"Jokers and Tokers\\", but recently refocused on the music of The Police, and rebranded accordingly as \\"Scrantonicity\\", a homage to their album Synchronicity. However, after getting into a fight with his bandmates, Kevin breaks off and forms a new band, \\"Scrantonicity II\\", a reference to The Police song \\"Synchronicity II\\". Kevin is a fan of the Philadelphia Eagles. His favorite foods are cookies, Cup o' Noodles, and M&M;'s. Kevin's favorite movies are American Pie 2,\\"Michael's Birthday\\" Weekend at Bernie's, and The Cannonball Run. His favorite number, not surprisingly, is 69, after the sexual position. According to Jim in a deleted scene from \\"The Dundies\\", Kevin is interested in naval history and enjoys bowling. Despite his obvious lack of athleticism, Kevin has demonstrated above-average skill at some sports: in \\"Basketball\\", he is shown to be an excellent shooter, and in \\"Dwight's Speech\\" he catches a hard-thrown football with ease despite his hands being full, and throws a hard and tight spiral directly on target. In \\"Health Care\\", it was revealed that he suffers from anal fissures.\\"Health Care\\" He is the resident gambler, partaking or initiating various bets throughout the office with other co-workers, and shows a fairly sharp talent for monitoring games fairly. In \\"Casino Night\\", he reveals that he won a World Series of Poker bracelet for the $2500 No-Limit Deuce-Seven Draw in 2002, but he nonetheless suffers defeat at the hands of an unwitting Phyllis Lapin-Vance. Kevin also enjoys cooking. As seen in the \\"Kevin Cooks Stuff in The Office\\" short, Kevin is currently brewing beer in the cabinet beside his desk, much to the disgust of his coworker Oscar Martinez. Kevin states that, \\"rules say I can't bring beer into the office, but they don't say anything about making beer in the office.\\" He also has recipes for office-made quesadillas, creme brulee, and mashed potatoes and once a year brings in a large pot of his \\"famous\\" chili for the office. Kevin and Oscar's personalities complement each other, with Oscar being the most intelligent Dunder-Mifflin employee and Kevin being arguably the least, and they are shown to be close friends. The two often do a fist bump when they have a minor achievement such as playing office games. Kevin suffers from plantar hyperhidrosis (\\"Grief Counseling\\" deleted scene). Angela is regularly disgusted by Kevin's feet and he protests that she knows about his medical condition. Little is said about his condition and there is a question from reviewers if Angela was in fact lying or making a false claim. In a webisode of \\"The Accountants\\", Angela sarcastically calls Kevin a genius, though Kevin secretly thinks his IQ of 100 makes him a genius.\\"The Accountants\\" Kevin drives a 2000 Honda CR-V. Seasons 1‚Äì2 Kevin is one of the more featured supporting characters and has many comic moments. While making a basketball team for a game against the warehouse employees, Michael ignores Kevin's plea to join the team, but it later turns out that Kevin is in fact an excellent player, as opposed to Stanley Hudson, whom he assumed to be talented based merely on the stereotype that because he is an African-American man, he would excel at playing, though he was actually clumsy and slow. He often tells people that Pam is \\"hot\\", though when Katy, a purse saleswoman, comes to the office, he tells Pam that Katy is prettier than she is. On \\"Diversity Day\\", when the employees are given a card with a specific race written on it, Kevin is given \\"Italian\\". In the same episode, he attempts to reenact for his coworkers a race-themed Chris Rock routine without offending anyone; Michael complains that Kevin has butchered the routine.Season 1 Kevin is the winner of the \\"Don't Go In There After Me\\" award at the 8th Annual Dundie Awards (a reference to his bathroom odor). This is referenced again later when he is seen coming out of the men's room with a lit scented candle.\\"Women's Appreciation\\" His favorite games to play at work are a paper football game which he and Oscar call \\"Hateball\\" (because Angela hates it), and \\"How Many M&M;'s Can You Put In Your Mouth?\\" (Angela points out that only he plays this).\\"Office Olympics\\" Kevin's relationship with Stacey begins this season. Kevin is despondent on Valentine's Day when he doesn't know where she is, but in a deleted scene he becomes very happy when she calls and says she's back in town. In \\"Take Your Daughter to Work Day\\", he brings Stacey's daughter Abby to the office, where she quickly becomes pals with Jim. In \\"Michael's Birthday\\", Kevin gets tested for skin cancer, which takes the mood away from party festivities, much to Michael's displeasure. The results end up negative (though Michael thought that 'negative' meant that his test revealed cancer). Jim and Pam encounter his The Police tribute band Scrantonicity, while searching for bands for Pam's wedding and Roy asks him to play for them which he accepts (although the marriage ends up being called off). Seasons 3‚Äì4 Generally, he doesn't get much responsibility, so in \\"The Merger\\", he is delighted that he gets to shred company documents. However, in the excitement of showing everything that it can shred, he puts in his own credit card. He later uses the shredder to make a salad.\\"The Merger\\" After some deliberation, Kevin joins Angela's party in \\"A Benihana Christmas\\", but only because of the double-fudge brownies.\\"A Benihana Christmas\\" Scrantonicity got to perform at \\"Phyllis' Wedding\\". It was the third wedding they performed at, having also played at their bassist's wedding and their guitarist's wedding.\\"Phyllis' Wedding\\" During \\"Cocktails\\", Kevin is asked if he and Stacy have set a date for their wedding. Kevin says they have, but it is very complicated, hinting that they may have separated. After Roy begins to shout at Pam for revealing the kiss she shared with Jim, Kevin can briefly be seen holding up his fists ready to defend Pam as she walks away from Roy.\\"Cocktails\\" During \\"The Merger\\" (deleted scene), he hides his M&M;'s under his desk so \\"they\\" (the new employees from Stamford) won't get to them, but is willing to share with Jim. In \\"The Convict\\", Kevin implies that he is involved in insider trading, but wasn't aware of the legal implications. He greatly enjoys the hot dog eating contest during \\"Beach Games\\", saying that lying on the beach eating hot dogs is \\"all he's ever wanted\\".Season 3 In the season premiere, \\"Fun Run\\", Kevin openly suspects Jim and Pam of \\"hooking up\\" and is determined to prove his speculations to his neighboring accountant Oscar. Oscar is not convinced, but Kevin is vindicated in the episode \\"Dunder Mifflin Infinity\\", when Jim and Pam reveal their relationship to their coworkers.\\"Dunder Mifflin Infinity\\" Kevin suffers a series of setbacks during the season. In the episode \\"Money\\", Kevin announces that he has split from the band \\"Scrantonicity\\" and formed \\"Scrantonicity II\\". However, none of his coworkers come to support his new band. He also reveals in the episode \\"The Chair Model\\" that he and his fianc√©e Stacy have ended their engagement. Also, Kevin, along with all of the other Dunder Mifflin employees (except for Michael) are made to park in a satellite parking lot, which angers all of them. Kevin is one of the most distraught, and he teams up with Andy in order to do something about it. They suggest to Michael that an assembly be called between the \\"Five Families\\". He later explains that the \\"Five Families\\" are the five companies which share the Scranton business park, and that the bosses \\"rarely meet\\". When Michael denies him the opportunity to call a meeting, Kevin and Andy decide to call a meeting anyway. At the meeting, Kevin and Andy attempt to be polite and in charge, since Michael isn't there. Kevin finally breaks down, demanding the parking spaces back, claiming that \\"some people have to park really far away and walk all the way to the office, and some people sweat too much for comfort.\\" Kevin's later success in resolving the parking space problem in Dunder Mifflin's favor gives him the small victory that he really needed.\\"The Chair Model\\" In \\"Job Fair\\", Kevin's zeal to gamble during a trip to the golf course with Jim, Andy and a prospective customer implies that his gambling may be a compulsive behavior rather than just a casual hobby, as he takes money from petty cash in order to turn it into \\"this month's rent.\\" In \\"Goodbye, Toby\\", Dwight tells the office's new HR representative Holly that Kevin is mentally challenged and that he got his job at Dunder Mifflin through a special program. Holly pays special attention to Kevin, praising him for being able to drive a car and helping him decipher how to choose a snack from the vending machine. Kevin, however, interprets Holly's frequent praise and breathy condescension as sexual interest in him.Season 4 Seasons 5‚Äì6 At the beginning of \\"Weight Loss\\", the season premiere, HR rep Holly still believes Kevin is mentally challenged. However, after Holly steps in when Angela berates Kevin over a mistake he made, the truth comes out and Holly is obviously embarrassed.\\"Weight Loss\\" In a deleted scene from \\"Baby Shower\\", it is revealed that Kevin donated sperm to the same sperm bank Jan went to, proclaiming \\"I might have done it with Jan\\" afterward. She is then taken back at the idea that he might be the biological father. In another scene, Jan publicly breastfeeds Astrid, much to the disturbance of most of the office- workers. Kevin then tries to discreetly look at the topless Jan, but she allows him to stare because she feels that it is natural. However, when Creed begins to stare, she starts to feel embarrassed and calls for Michael. During an office robbery in \\"Crime Aid\\", Kevin's surge protector was stolen. Unfortunately, Kevin \\"is now prone to surges\\". In a deleted scene, Ryan confesses that he ran his BMW into Kevin's car and damaged a side mirror, but refuses to pay for the damages by claiming that \\"Ryan 1.0\\" was responsible; Kevin later puts Ryan's pricey sunglasses in the microwave and melts them, sarcastically blaming it on \\"Kevin 1.0\\". In \\"Prince Family Paper\\", Kevin finds out that he does not have full internet access at the office. During the episode \\"Blood Drive\\", Kevin meets a woman named Lynn, and likes her but is awkward when talking to her. Andy, Jim, and Pam give him greatly disparate advice on wooing her in \\"Golden Ticket\\", and ultimately he successfully asks her to dinner and a movie. Kevin is seen kissing her passionately in \\"Cafe Disco\\". However, in a deleted scene, Kevin tells the camera that he and Lynn had broken up. Kevin mentions her in \\"The Delivery\\", declaring that \\"Lynn was way hotter than Erin \\". In \\"Casual Friday\\" Kevin brings a batch of his \\"Kevin's Famous Chili\\" upstairs to the office, only to drop the pot, causing chili to spill all over the floor in front of Erin's desk. He desperately tries to clean up the mess, only to drench papers and binders in chili while spreading the food all over the carpet. It is also shown that he drives a Honda CR-V.Season 5 In the episode \\"Gossip\\", Michael spreads rumors about various people throughout the Office, including that Kevin has a person inside of him who controls him like a machine. In \\"Niagara\\", Kevin is twice mistaken as \\"Gil\\", Oscar's boyfriend much to Oscar's disgust and Kevin's amusement. He also wears a toupee, comparing himself to Ashton Kutcher. and tissue boxes on his feet to Jim and Pam's wedding (after the hotel staff throws out his shoes instead of shining them claiming the horrible smell coming from them was a \\"safety issue\\"). In the episode \\"Mafia\\", Kevin inadvertently causes Jim's credit card to get canceled while he and Pam are on their honeymoon in Puerto Rico. He answers Jim's phone and pretends to be Jim while hanging out in Jim's office causing the bank teller to think Jim is in Scranton and the honeymoon trip was an incident of identity theft.Season 6 In \\"Koi Pond\\" Kevin dresses up as Paul Blart. In \\"Double Date\\" Michael fake-fires Kevin for suggesting to Michael that Michael and Pam's mother slept together. When Erin tells Michael she wants to be an accountant in Scott's Tots, he tells Erin that Kevin originally applied for the warehouse, but he saw something in him. In \\"Secret Santa\\", Michael lets Kevin sit on his lap to show that he is a better Santa than Phyllis who took his place, but Michael ends telling Kevin that he almost killed him because of his weight. In \\"The Delivery\\" Kevin sets up lunch for Pam, which they call ultra feast, and tells the camera that he has cooked his way through the Julia Child book and now is halfway through the Twilight Cookbook. Michael sets Kevin up with Erin but when Erin tells Michael that she likes Andy, not Kevin, Michael ends up telling Kevin that Erin never liked him and he should not have taken Michael's prior comments about her being interested in him seriously. In \\"New Leads\\" Dwight tries to choke Kevin because he hid the leads, which he threw in the trashcan. In \\"Happy Hour\\" Kevin makes baby sounds to Pam in hopes of causing her breasts to secrete milk, to no avail until Kelly's crying causes it. In \\"Secretary's Day\\", the office are amused by a video Oscar makes that compares Kevin's voice to that of Cookie Monster. Kevin reports it to Gabe, but the office ignores Gabe's attempts to stop the mockery and ultimately, Kevin ends up impersonating Gabe as well, making everybody laugh. At the end of the episode, he makes a video of Oscar as The Count with only Michael finding it funny. Season 7 In the cold open of \\"Nepotism\\", when the entire staff is doing a lip-dub to \\"Nobody but Me\\", Kevin wears a fedora with sunglasses and has Meredith strapped on his back. Later, Kevin helps Pam play a prank on Dwight with switching the buttons on an elevator. It is established he used to work in elevator maintenance. However, a deleted scene suggests that this may be a lie, leading to the elevator's breakdown. In a deleted scene of \\"Counseling\\" Michael asks the sales staff if they have ever had a dog and Kevin tells Michael that he likes the dog Brian from Family Guy saying, \\"He has a funny voice.\\" In a deleted scene of \\"Andy's Play\\", Kevin visits his sister who is also in the production of Sweeney Todd. In \\"Sex Ed\\", when Meredith reveals she has genital herpes, Kevin mistakenly thinks that means she has a penis. Later, during Andy's sex ed, Andy asks what are some of the consequences of sex besides STDs, and Kevin shouts out that intercourse feels \\"unbelievable\\". Andy then makes a pro- column. When listening to other pros of sex, Kevin shouts out that it feels \\"amazing\\", which leads him to be asked by Andy whether there's a difference between \\"unbelievable\\" and \\"amazing\\", to which Kevin answers yes. When the topic of unplanned pregnancies comes up, it results in some negative comments towards Jim and Pam, the most negative coming from Kevin, who tries to get them to admit their baby was a mistake. In \\"The Sting\\", he joins Andy's band with Darryl and is the drummer. He suggests that maybe he could sing Andy's song, but Andy believes Kevin's voice would be better suited for a novelty song about frogs. Kevin still tries to persuade Andy to let him sing his song since he believes he has a unique voice, \\"like Bob Dylan\\". Later, the band performs a song titled \\"Bullfrog in Love\\", with Kevin doing the vocals. In the cold open of \\"Costume Contest\\", when the staff is trying to see the limit of what Stanley won't notice, Kevin dresses up as Phyllis and sits at her desk, but Stanley doesn't realize the difference. At the costume party, Kevin dresses up as Michael Moore. Kevin shows some anger towards new traveling salesman Danny, who went out with Pam years earlier and never called her back, and claims he will never forget what he did since he's \\"like an Elephant that way\\". However, he does want to go to Danny's bar that the staff was invited to but decides against in respect to Jim and Pam. When Andy and Kevin tell him why they will not be able to make it, Danny tells them he'll talk to Jim and Pam (since Andy and Kevin exaggerated by saying they begged them not to go), and Kevin warns him not to tell them they said anything or Danny's \\"dead\\". Kevin also strikes up a friendship with Gabe, telling him about some Lady Gaga moves he could do for the costume catwalk, but is wrongly yelled at by Michael, who believed Kevin was going over his head to Gabe with an idea. Kevin starts to cry and hysterically pleads to Michael that he's learned his lesson, and tells Gabe \\"f**k you!\\" afterward. In \\"Christening\\", Kevin attends the christening of Jim and Pam's daughter, Cece, but when the food quickly runs out at Jim and Pam's reception, he complains that he canceled his plans to come and feels he is not being properly rewarded. Michael harshly tells Kevin, and Stanley, who was complaining as well, that if they don't stop worrying about what they're going to eat all the time, they will be dead in \\"about a month\\". Later, when Jim believes Angela stole his baby and he yells out for someone to stop her from leaving the church, Kevin grabs her purse, believing the baby to be stored in there, but instead finds what he thinks to be \\"thousands\\" of scones Angela stole from reception. In \\"Viewing Party\\", when the office is watching a live broadcast of the SWAT surrounding the Scranton Strangler's house, he thinks they \\"should do that thing where they play the really good music to get him to come out\\". Kevin also sets Michael down his jealous path when he refers to Gabe as the boss. Later, at the viewing party, he climbs into Gabe's bed with a plate of \\"pigs in a blanket\\" hors d'oeuvres and pulls the covers over himself, since he wants to try \\"pigs in a blanket\\" while under a blanket. In the beginning of \\"WUPHF.com\\", when the office's computer servers go temporarily down, and everyone is trying to remember the password, Kevin suggests \\"Big Boobs\\". (It is revealed to be, as suggested by Dwight, \\"big boobz\\".) Later, Jim learns through Kevin that he maxed out his commission's cap (although, at first, Kevin believes there's something wrong with his computer since he entered the sale in while doing \\"dunh-duh-na- dah!\\"). Kevin also gets lost in the \\"Hay Place\\" maze. In \\"China\\", when Michael demands big ideas to stop China's growing power, Kevin comes up with the idea of an antacid you only take once a week. Michael then asks for any better ideas, and Kevin suggests an antacid you only take every six weeks, causing Stanley to sarcastically ask why not go for a full year, causing Kevin to answer that then it would be too big a pill to swallow. Kevin soon teases Oscar after it turns out Michael was right and he was wrong in a conversation about China's population. Later, Dwight asks Kevin what he would think would make the office building a better place, since he's putting together a \\"wish list\\". Kevin then wishes for a million wishes, where Dwight informs him he's not a genie, causing Kevin to tell the \\"building\\" to get lost. In the cold open of \\"Classy Christmas\\", when Michael is trying to decide what everyone should do in the Christmas group photo, Kevin suggests the men and women be separated, and the men should stand in a \\"why I oughta\\" pose, while the women stand in a \\"let's go shopping\\" pose, but his idea is quickly rejected. In the episode, Kevin shows that he is not impressed that Angela's boyfriend is a state senator, and it is hinted Kevin does not know what a comptroller is. When Pam asks for volunteers to come with her to buy a Christmas tree, Kevin declines, saying he doesn't want to get dirty in case any girls show up at the party, leading Pam to berate him to stop thinking that, since no one ever invites other women. When Holly arrives, Kevin is obviously upset that she ate half of the maple candies she brought for the office. After Holly confronts the staff over who threw her Woody doll in the trash, Kevin comes up with the theory that, since Toy Story is about toys coming alive when nobody's around, Woody came alive and threw himself in the garbage. In \\"Ultimatum\\", Holly raises up her ring fingers to show that she is not engaged, but Kevin misunderstands and calls her a \\"bitch\\" while giving her \\"the finger\\". Kevin's new year resolution he puts on Pam's \\"New Year's Resolution Board\\" is for him to eat more vegetables. Later, in the conference room, Michael, upset that Holly didn't stick to her ultimatum that if AJ didn't propose to her she would dump him, projects his anger onto the rest of the office for not sticking to their resolutions, and forces Kevin to eat a stalk of broccoli. While at first, Kevin is glad Michael is making him stick to his resolution, he soon finds it very difficult eating it. He starts eating it stem-first (since it's a \\"new food\\" for him and he doesn't know how else he should eat it), but soon begs Michael to allow him to put \\"Cheese Whiz\\" or hollandaise on it, but Michael forces him to eat it plain. Kevin is so disgusted though, that he hides it under his tongue and eventually spits it out. Kevin is soon called into Michael's office, where Michael apologizes for his actions. Kevin tells him that he means no offense, but Michael needs to get his life. Michael says he's right and he hopes they can still be friends, which causes Kevin to readily forgive him and gives him a big, crushing hug while saying he's going to \\"help\\" Michael with his problems. Shortly afterward, Kevin defaces Ryan's resolution to \\"Live life like an art project\\" by writing an \\"F\\" in front of the word \\"art\\". While Ryan uses the incident in the conference room as a comeback, Kevin still mocks Ryan and makes a farting noise, only to embarrassingly pass gas for real. In \\"The Seminar\\", Kevin is one of the workers Andy asks to help him out in the seminar. When Kevin begins his presentation, he runs around the conference room while \\"Crazy Train\\" is played, causing him to get exhausted and throw up. In \\"The Search\\", when Pam presents her drawing of two dogs on a desert island, Kevin believes that it's two giant dogs with two giant palm trees on a regular size island (instead of just an incredibly tiny island). In \\"PDA\\", Michael and Holly's public displays of affection make Kevin \\"horny\\". In a meeting about Public Displays of Affection, Dwight reads a list of names of employees who have had sex in the office, and Kevin adds his own name to the list, but Angela, doubting that he has, asks with who, only for Kevin to state that \\"she goes to another school\\". When Michael is worried that Holly might break up with him again, Kevin does a \\"monkey face\\" in an attempt to cheer him up. After Michael and Holly announce that they're moving in together and Oscar encourages them to kiss, Kevin says \\"Suck on that, Oscar\\" even though he was the one who told them to kiss. In \\"Threat Level Midnight\\", Kevin is in Michael's movie of the same name as \\"Hostage #3\\". In \\"Todd Packer\\", Kevin is excited when he learns Todd Packer will be working at the office full-time, but Todd later insults him for the fun of it. Kevin tries to pretend he's fine with it, but is obviously hurt. Michael later calls Kevin up in front of the office so Packer can apologize to him. Kevin claims he wasn't offended, but Michael still makes Packer say he's sorry, although the apology is very insincere. In this episode, Kevin also states to the camera that he has very little patience for stupidity. In \\"Garage Sale\\", Kevin sells a Dallas board game at the warehouse garage sale. Kevin, Andy and Darryl play and bet on the game, but the instruction booklet is not with the game, so Andy and Darryl make up the rules as they go along, much to Kevin's objection. Eventually, Kevin notices the money they had bet on the game with is missing, and storms out. As Darryl and Andy look at each other in confusion, Kevin reveals to the cameras that he has the money, stating, \\"And that... is Dallas\\", mocking Andy and Darryl's previous statement. In \\"Training Day\\" Kevin Wears a toupee to impress the new boss, Deangelo Vickers. He tells him that he \\"hates bald people.\\" Later, when Michael passes out mini peanut butter sandwiches, he tosses one to Kevin, who catches it in his mouth. In \\"Goodbye, Michael\\", Michael's going-away present to Kevin is a caricature of Kevin as a pig sloppily eating a pizza. Michael rips it up and tells Kevin that he will be thin and he will find love. Kevin informs him that he's okay with who he is now, but Michael tells him he should never settle for that. When Michael is questioned on what town in Colorado Holly's parents live in, he answers \\"Mountainton\\", which Kevin says sounds beautiful. At lunch, Kevin says that he does not like the shredder at the office, saying that it won't shred magazines, implying that he broke the shredder trying to shred whole magazines. In the beginning of \\"The Inner Circle\\", Deangelo barks out positive things in a nasty tone so the staff won't \\"figure [him] out\\". However, he tells the camera that Kevin pegged him after he says Deangelo's idea of Ice Cream Thursday is awesome, but at Deangelo's intense staring, quickly says why he'd understand why some people would not like the idea. Later, in a talking-head interview, Kevin reveals (and gives a shout out to his mom) that he is a part of Deangelo's inner circle, but soon says it doesn't exist to cover it up. Kevin is also amazed when Deangelo does his mime juggling act and by the fact that Deangelo didn't drop a single (imaginary) ball. When Jim tells Deangelo that the women think he's sexist, the men automatically think it was Pam who said it, and Kevin tells Deangelo that Pam \\"can get really bitchy\\", and then does a shrill impression of her, even though Jim is right there. Later, when Deangelo is challenged to dunk from the free-throw line, he has Kevin sit underneath the basket. Kevin is able to roll out of the way when Deangelo accidentally brings the basketball stand down. In \\"Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager\\", Kevin proves to be little slow in citing the Pledge of Allegiance. He also takes a great deal of time trying to type his 21 digit-codes for usage of the copy machine, much to the frustration of other employees. However, Kevin is only truly devastated when he finds out that Dwight has removed every snack within vending machines. After Dwight accidentally fires a gun and the rest of the office demands that the acting manager restore everything back to normal, Kevin is surprised when he finds a hastily abandoned piranha that Dwight left in the bathroom. He blackmails Dwight to put everything back into the vending machine, but demands the fruit not be restored, and later blackmails him into giving him a massage. In \\"Search Committee\\", Kevin describes \\"The Botanical Gardens\\" as \\"Scranton's hidden gem\\", but warns Angela, who is heading there to have lunch with her boyfriend, the State Senator, not to eat any berries she doesn't recognize. Later, when some of the staff debate over whether they should tell Angela that her now fianc√© is gay, Kevin comes up with a theory that if Angela can get a gay man to marry her, maybe he could get a Lesbian to marry him. He ultimately agrees that they shouldn't tell Angela to keep her happy. Later, when Erin uses a sock puppet as part of her plan to ask Andy out, Kevin says in a talking-head interview that he likes sock puppets, but wishes they would talk more about the alphabet. He says it's not for him, but if \\"any kids are watching\\". He then tries to demonstrate saying the alphabet, but performs it poorly. Season 8 In \\"The List\\", Kevin is on the \\"winners\\" side of new Sabre CEO Robert California, and while he is out to lunch with the other \\"winners\\" and Robert, sends a text to all the \\"losers\\" telling them to suck it. Robert's odd belief that Kevin is a winner seems to persist well into \\"Gettysburg\\", when Kevin makes a vacuous statement about the desirability of cookies and Robert thinks he's making a brilliant analogy, but Ryan Howard later proves Kevin was really just talking about cookies. Robert looks completely horrified at this. In \\"The Incentive\\", Kevin begins speaking in childish, conjunction-free terms. Angela thinks this is how he really sounds, but Oscar realizes Kevin is pretending to be even more stupid than he really is, as an ironic commentary about people's low expectations for him. The office later marginalizes him into doing busy work, so he won't trigger Dwight's doomsday error-finding device. In \\"Garden Party\\", Kevin, once again, wears his toupee to \\"Schrute Farms\\". While he is there, he stops a waiter from walking around and offering hors d'oeuvres to the other guests (creepily putting his finger over the waiter's mouth and going \\"shhhh\\"), makes a toast to Robert California, and sits on a teeter totter with Ryan, but strands him up in the air (although Kevin believes the teeter totter is broken). In \\"Spooked\\", it is revealed that Kevin has a fear for mummies, but think they are no more than a myth, until Oscar and Robert revealed that mummies are in fact real and are in museums, which horrifies Kevin. In \\"Trivia\\", Kevin tries to join the \\"A-team\\" for the trivia contest, which includes Andy, Jim, Darryl, and Ryan, only to be gently steered away from that group and into the \\"Hail Mary\\" team with the less intellectually imposing Kelly, Erin, and Meredith. To the astonishment of Andy and all of the other teams at the gay bar where the contest is taking place, the Hail Mary team in general and Kevin in particular prove to be excellent at answering obscure questions and win the $1,000 prize. Kevin speaks with pride about the achievement. However, in the episode's closing scenes, Kevin and the rest of his team try to win a higher-stakes trivia contest and fail miserably. Kevin was not on Dwight's original list of the five team members for the Sabre Store trip to Tallahassee in \\"Special Project\\", but he was one of Andy's five choices for the compromise list he gave to Dwight. Ultimately, Kevin is not selected to go to Tallahassee, and neither are fellow accountants Oscar and Angela. While Kevin is generally portrayed as a simple-minded and unsophisticated person, he is shown to exhibit remarkable astuteness in \\"Fundraiser\\". It is Dwight, not him, who misunderstands the rules of silent auctions. Kevin comments this as Dwight being the \\"stupid guy\\" in the office and says that no one had borne this title before. He (apart from Ryan and a therapy dog named Kenny) also seems to be the only one to notice that Andy is suffering from a mental breakdown after his abrupt dismissal from Dunder Mifflin that he tries to conceal by unnatural cheerfulness and generosity. When Pam, Erin, and Jim reassure Andy that he would be all right, Kevin says that he would not be. Kevin also concludes that he feels like everyone he works with is an idiot. At the end of the episode, Kevin is revealed to have adopted a dog, Ruby. The way he describes Ruby's behavior makes his coworkers think that the dog is dead. In fact, Ruby is alive, albeit very old and feeble, or at the least, very lazy. Season 9 In \\"The Boat\\", Kevin overhears Oscar talking about kissing Angela's husband Robert. When Oscar sees that Kevin heard, he goes to great lengths to ensure that Kevin keeps the secret, which he does. Later, in \\"Vandalism\\", Kevin and Oscar attend Angela's son's birthday party where Kevin confronts Robert and accuses him of using Oscar and Angela to boost his political campaign. In the series finale Dwight mentions to the camera that he fired Kevin shortly after the airing of the documentary; a later interview reveals that Kevin had been cooking the books at Dunder-Mifflin for the duration of the series, using the invented number \\"Keleven\\" to correct his myriad mathematical errors. During Dwight's bachelor party, Jim takes all of the current and past men from the office to a bar, where it is revealed that Kevin is the owner. When Kevin refuses them service and tells them to get out, Dwight tells Kevin that he was only fired because of his constant mistakes and that he misses him and still considers him a friend. Kevin forgives Dwight, and hugs him telling him that he misses him too. He later attends Dwight's wedding.  Webisodes  =The Accountants= During the time period between the second and third seasons, NBC posted The Accountants, a season of \\"webisodes\\" (online mini episodes) with Kevin, Oscar, and Angela attempting to solve an accounting error. The error ends up being the fault of Angela and when it is discovered, Kevin says it is the best day of his life. =Kevin's Loan= Throughout the summer between the fourth and fifth seasons, NBC's website featured a new season of webisodes entitled Kevin's Loan. The four online episodes detailed Kevin's attempts to find money in order to pay his gambling debt back to his bookmaker. Kevin settles on trying to get a small business loan under the auspices of selling ice cream. When his first attempt goes poorly, Darryl joins Kevin in making the proposal to another loan officer at the same bank and they bring a sample into the meeting. Darryl flirts with the female loan officer and asks her to \\"taste the ice cream\\". When she does, she remarks that it tastes like Breyer's. The first loan officer comes in and Darryl asks him to taste the ice cream. The loan officer asks if they made the ice cream or bought it in a store and Kevin throws a nervous fit, hissing at Darryl to abort their mission. The webisode season ends with Kevin selling ice cream outside of the office to pay back his debt. Stanley comes out to buy some but refuses to pay the ten dollar cost. And Kevin is seen with a sly smile turned to a slight frown.

Their shorelines or watersheds are largely primitive and undeveloped but they are accessible in places by roads. *Pastoral rivers are those that are not impounded except for historic or restored mill dams. There may be diversions or withdrawals to support agricultural activities, for example agricultural ponds. Their shorelines or watersheds may support a variety of farm or farm- related activities, but these activities may not interfere with the pastoral nature of the landscape. *Recreational rivers or sections of rivers are easily accessible, may have some development along their shorelines, and may have been impounded or diverted in the past. *Modified recreational rivers (or sections of rivers) are those in which the flow may be regulated by upstream control devices. Low dams are permitted as long as they do not increase the river beyond bankfull width. These rivers are designated for human activities which do not interfere with public use of the streams or enjoyment of their surroundings.

He served as President of the Languedoc-Roussillon Region from 2004 until his death: prior to that, he had been mayor of Montpellier for 27 years, and was also a former member (d√©put√©) of the National Assembly. Fr√™che had been a member of the French Socialist Party until he was expelled on January 27, 2007. A long-time political figure within French political circles, Fr√™che was an extremely controversial character, considered by some a great builder and visionary, while criticised by others and judged in court for his controversial remarks, which were sometimes interpreted as racist. Life and career Fr√™che was born in Puylaurens, Tarn, in 1938. His father was a military officer, while his mother was a primary school headmistress.. Fr√™che studied law in Paris, and was appointed professor of law at the University of Montpellier 1 in 1969, specializing in Roman law, before entering politics. He served as the mayor of Montpellier from 1977 to 2004. Building on the trend started by his predecessor Fran√ßois Delmas, who landed the Southern Europe IBM factory and headquarters as well as the scientific university, Fr√™che expanded Montpellier in all directions, propelling it from the 25th-largest city in France to the eighth, in less than 30 years. Under Fr√™che, Montpellier, whose slogan, in the 1980s, reflecting Fr√™che's ambition, was \\"the overachiever\\", specialised in clean, tertiary industries such as banking, electronics and water processing. In 2004, Fr√™che was elected president of the Languedoc- Roussillon Region, and had to resign as mayor of Montpellier after 27 years in office, although he remained president of Montpellier Agglom√©ration, the local agglomeration community. While he was a member of French's Socialist Party (PS) and the leader of one of the largest socialist federations in France, Georges Fr√™che was never given a ministerial position in any socialist government, not even as socialist Fran√ßois Mitterrand was France's president for 14 years. This could have been due to both the fact that Fr√™che was an embarrassing figure for the socialists, prone to multiple politically incorrect speeches with racist overtones, and his alleged refusal to let the Socialist Party be secretly financed by fake bills issued by the private company Urba (Urba would cause a major political scandal in France). He had antagonized Fran√ßois Mitterrand as early as the foundation of the current French Socialist Party in 1971, being cast aside even at that date. Fr√™che was permanently expelled from the Socialist Party on January 27, 2007, after commenting that the number of black players on the French national football team was disproportionately higher than one might expect from France's demographics.. Fr√™che maintained that he was not trying to be racist and was instead talking about whites being less successful at sports because they are not sufficiently \\"hungry\\". Fr√™che continued to attract controversy after his expulsion from the Socialist Party, insulting former Socialist Prime Minister Laurent Fabius in the run-up to the 2010 regional elections, saying \\"I've got a problem voting for that guy from Haute-Normandie, he doesn't look too Catholic\\" (Fabius has Ashkenazi Jewish roots)... The Socialist Party ran against Fr√™che's \\"independent left\\" list in the elections for Languedoc- Roussillon, with Fr√™che's successor as mayor of Montpellier, H√©l√®ne Mandroux as the head of list, but were roundly defeated, gaining only 7.74% in the first round, against Fr√™che's 34.28%. Fr√™che went on to easily win the three- way second round with 54.19%, against lists from the UMP (26.43%) and the FN (15.67%). Fr√™che died of a heart attack in Montpellier on the afternoon of October 24, 2010, aged 72.. Controversial comments * July 1, 2000: \\"This is the longest tunnel in the world. You enter it in France and you come out in Ouarzazate\\",¬´ Ici, c'est le tunnel le plus long du monde : vous entrez en France et vous sortez √† Ouarzazate. ¬ª a city in Morocco. Fr√™che was referring to the then-newly installed tramway line, of which one of the two terminus is in Montpellier's La Paillade, an area chiefly populated by citizens of Arab origin and Muslim religion... * April, 2005: \\"I hope he does better than the other idiot\\",¬´ J'esp√®re qu'il sera meilleur que l'autre abruti. Celui-l√†, on le jugera sur le mariage des pr√™tres et la capote. ¬ª referring to the election of the new pope Benedict XVI, replacing pope John-Paul II, the \\"idiot\\" in his sentence. * February 11, 2006: In a diatribe against a group of Harkis, who fought alongside France in the independence war of Algeria, Fr√™che referred to them as \\"sub-humans\\".¬´ Vous √™tes vraiment d‚Äôune incurie incroyable.

In its survey of \\"The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time,\\" the English magazine Mojo ranks Nolen number twelve. Career =Early life and career= Born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States, Nolen took up the guitar at the age of 14, teaching himself on a Harmony Acoustic guitar. Having played the violin since the age of 9, Nolen already had a sound musical foundation upon which to base his T-Bone Walker-inspired guitar playing. Nolen was \\"discovered\\" in a club in Tulsa, Oklahoma by Jimmy Wilson, a blues singer famous for his 1953 hit \\"Tin Pan Alley.\\" Soon afterward, Wilson offered Nolen a job in his band. He took Nolen back to Los Angeles, California to play in a studio band with popular southern California players Monte Easter (trumpet) and Chuck Higgins (tenor saxophone). During this period Nolen recorded his own commercially unsuccessful singles, mostly for King Records' Federal subsidiary, on which he both sang and played period-inspired blues songs. In 1957 Nolen began to play for Johnny Otis, replacing the ailing Pete \\"Guitar\\" Lewis. He was the principal behind Otis' hit \\"Willie and the Hand Jive.\\" He remained in Otis‚Äô band until 1959 when he formed his own group, The Jimmy Nolen Band. They performed in small clubs and ballrooms in California and Arizona's \\"Chitlin' Circuit\\", backing many of the blues greats that passed through California. The principal influences that inspired his guitar technique were, T-Bone Walker, B.B. King and Lowell Fulson. The Jimmy Nolen band was popular but never released any records since their primary purpose was to work as live backup for more famous acts. In the early 1960s Nolen began playing with the backing band for harmonica legend George \\"Harmonica\\" Smith. =James Brown (1965-?)= In 1965, Nolen joined the James Brown band at the recommendation of Les Buie, Brown's guitar player at that time. Buie had grown tired of the road and recommended Nolen as a replacement when the band was in Los Angeles. Like saxophone player Maceo Parker, trombonist Fred Wesley and drummers Clyde Stubblefield and John \\"Jabo\\" Starks, Nolen was a staple in James Brown's band. =The J.B.'s/Maceo and All the King's Men era (1972-1973)= During this time Nolen began to tour with Maceo Parker‚Äôs group Maceo & All the King‚Äôs Men. James replied to the mass resignation of his musicians by hiring a then- juvenile band called the Pacemakers from Cincinnati, Ohio. This band was composed of the young but heavy-hitting William \\"Bootsy\\" Collins on bass, his brother Phelps \\"Catfish\\" Collins on guitar, Robert McCullough on saxophone, Clayton Gunnels on trumpet, and Frank Waddy on drums. The new band was named The J.B.'s and marked a new era for James Brown. Months after this new band was formed Starks and Stubblefield returned. Despite this band's undeniable talent for playing breakneck funk, it was relatively short-lived as a group, as the Collins brothers soon left to join George Clinton's Parliament- Funkadelic organization. In 1972 Nolen returned to play with The J.B.'s. =Death= Nolen remained with Brown until December 18, 1983, when he died of a heart attack in Atlanta, Georgia. \\"Chicken scratch\\" sound Nolen developed a style of picking known as \\"chicken scratch,\\" in which the guitar strings are pressed lightly against the fingerboard and then quickly released just enough to get a muted ‚Äúscratching‚Äù sound that is produced by rapid rhythmic strumming of the opposite hand near the bridge. This new guitar style was affected not only by Nolen‚Äôs choice of two and three note chord voicings of augmented 7th and 9th chords, but also by his strumming straight 16th note patterns, as in James Brown‚Äôs \\"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag.\\" Nolen‚Äôs choices of guitars and amplifiers also affected the sound for which he would be nicknamed. In his first recordings with James Brown, Nolen used a Gibson ES-175 and an ES-5 switchmaster, both hollow-body jazz guitars equipped with single coil P-90s. He also relied on a Gibson Les Paul Recording model with single coil pickups, an Acoustic Black Widow, and a Fresher Straighter, which were also single coil instruments. The single coil pickups on these guitars produced a thin \\"chanky\\" sound; Nolen ran these guitars through a Fender Twin Reverb with the treble set at 8 out of 10. The result was a rhythm guitar sound that seemed to float somewhere between the low-end thump of the electric bass and the cutting tone of the snare and hi-hats, with a rhythmically melodic feel that fell deep in the pocket. A good example of such tone would be in James Brown‚Äôs \\"I Got You (I Feel Good)\\" and \\"I‚Äôve Got The Feeling.\\" Nolen had been experimenting with the sound prior to his joining James Brown: it can be heard on the Johnny Otis song \\"Willie and the Hand Jive\\" (1958) and an obscure 45 RPM single called \\"Swinging Peter Gunn Theme (Parts 1&2), released in 1960 on the Fidelity label, a subsidiary of Art Rupe's Specialty Records. Hip hop legacy Despite the fact that Nolen defined the guitar style which influenced decades of guitarists and funk groups to follow, including Earth Wind and Fire, Tower of Power, Chic, George Clinton, and more, his influence on other forms of contemporary popular music such as hip hop is often overlooked. James Brown cuts such as \\"Papas Got a Brand New Bag,\\" \\"I Got You (I Feel Good),\\" \\"It's a Man's Man's Man's World,\\" \\"Cold Sweat,\\" \\"Bring it Up (Hipster‚Äôs Avenue),\\" \\"Ain‚Äôt it Funky,\\" \\"Funky Drummer,\\" and \\"The Boss\\" have been sampled, mimicked and otherwise utilized by countless producers, DJs, and MCs. Eric B., the producer/DJ associated with Rakim Allah's early recordings, was known for his use of James Brown samples, most of which featured Nolen, \\"Jabo\\" Starks and/or Clyde Stubblefield. A good example of this would be ‚ÄúMove the Crowd‚Äù, in which Eric B. sampled Brown‚Äôs 1969 recording \\"Say It Loud - I'm Black and I'm Proud\\" featuring the aforementioned lineup, or the 1973 \\"Blind Man Can See it\\" for Eric B. & Rakim‚Äôs \\"?.\\" The Bomb Squad, Public Enemy‚Äôs production group, is another name on the lengthy list of producers that have relied heavily on James Brown grooves assisted by Nolen‚Äôs ‚Äúchicken scratch‚Äù style: Brown's 1973 \\"Make it Good to Yourself\\" was the part of the foundation on which Public Enemy laid their cut \\"1 Million Bottlebags.\\"  References  *Larkin, Colin, ed. \\"Jimmy Nolen.\\" Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music.

Design and development =RSRA= The Rotor Systems Research Aircraft (RSRA) was developed by Sikorsky for NASA and the Army. The RSRA was developed to allow the inflight measurement of helicopter rotor characteristics. The airframe was developed using an existing Sikorsky S-61 main rotor, an S-61 roller gearbox, and a highly modified Sikorsky S-67 airframe. The RSRA could be fitted with TF34 turbofans and wings to allow compound helicopter configurations to be experimentally investigated at speeds up to . In addition, it could fly as a fixed-wing aircraft without a rotor. Unique among helicopters of its time, it was fitted with a crew emergency extraction system. This system, when activated, fired explosive bolts that severed the main rotor blades, escape panels were blown off the roof of the aircraft, then the crew was extracted using rockets. The RSRA was a unique pure research aircraft developed to fill the void between design analysis, wind tunnel testing, and flight results of rotor aircraft. The joint NASA/Army project began in December 1970, first flight on October 12, 1976 with the first of two aircraft arriving from Sikorsky to NASA on February 11, 1979. One notable test performed with the RSRA was the use of the main and tail rotor load measurement system to determine the vertical drag of the airframe. In 1981, NASA and the US Army solicited proposals for fitting a four-bladed main rotor to the RSRA. Sikorsky proposed fitting a UH-60A main rotor to the RSRA in their proposal, while Hughes Helicopters proposed fitting a YAH-64A main rotor and Boeing Vertol proposed fitting a YUH-61A or Model 347 (four-blade CH-47) main rotor. In the end, this program did not proceed. =The X-Wing= Sikorsky S-72 modified as the X-Wing testbed Rotor Systems Research Aircraft / X-Wing aircraft during a 1987 high speed taxi test The X-Wing circulation control rotor concept was developed in the mid-1970s by the David W. Taylor Naval Ship Research and Development Center under DARPA funding. In October 1976, Lockheed Corporation won a DARPA contract to develop a large-scale rotor to test the concept. Intended to take off vertically like a helicopter, the craft's rigid rotors could be stopped in mid-flight to act as X-shaped wings to provide additional lift during forward flight, as well as having more conventional wings. Instead of controlling lift by altering the angle of attack of its blades as more conventional helicopters do, the craft used compressed air fed from the engines and expelled from its blades to generate a virtual wing surface, similar to blown flaps on a conventional platform. Computerized valves made sure the compressed air came from the correct edge of the rotor, the correct edge changing as the rotor rotated. In late 1983 Sikorsky received a contract to modify one S-72 RSRA into a demonstration testbed for the X-Wing rotor system. The modified airframe was rolled out in 1986, but never flew before the program was cancelled in 1988.

This led to the water system becoming contaminated far beyond the legal safety limit and forced the city to implement a boil water advisory for all of the city's two-million residents for more than a week‚Äîthe largest such advisory in Canadian history. The advisory affected the local food industry, forcing supermarkets and restaurants to stop selling produce which couldn't be safely washed, and causing the majority of the city's many coffee shops to close. Although no dangerous bacteria levels were observed, the water was still considered unclean and unsafe to drink, wash vegetables or brush teeth with, without boiling it first for at least 1 minute. Bottled water was in high demand and became scarce in many areas. The storms were caused by an Aleutian Low's steering current, which allowed low pressure areas from the central subtropics of the North Pacific Ocean to track northeast and near areas of British Columbia, sometimes bringing more than 100 mm (4 in) of rain from each low. As the low pressure systems were slowly replaced by an Arctic ridge, temperatures on November 25 dipped to at Vancouver International Airport and the cities of Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley were hit with a series of heavy snowstorms. The highest recorded one-day snowfall from the event was the which occurred in Abbotsford.ec.gc.ca: B.C.

He is a first-generation Mexican American. He is also openly gay after being outed by his then boss Michael Scott in \\"Gay Witch Hunt\\", the third-season premiere episode devoted to the outing.Interview With Oscar N√∫√±ez, by Craig Young, October 4, 2006, AfterElton.com. However, the character was implied to be gay in the second- season episode \\"The Secret\\", when Dwight catches him faking sickness to spend the day with his boyfriend (Dwight remains oblivious to this detail as he was obsessed with proving that Oscar was not ill). As a result, in earlier episodes, many co-workers erroneously attribute to him various Mexican stereotypes (e.g. being involved in drug cartels) but after his outing, his stereotypes are more focused on his being gay, particularly by Michael, which may explain their conflicted relationship. N√∫√±ez explained in a 2008 interview that the character variously feels amusement, pity and hatred towards his fictional boss. He has no specific counterpart in the original British series. Oscar is known for being a rational, quietly efficient, and intellectual worker in the office, often the one who will ask pointed financial questions that his colleagues will not or that Michael avoids answering.\\"Oscar Nu√±ez Discusses His Character From 'The Office'\\", March 10, 2009, Mike Ryan, Star Pulse. Oscar N√∫√±ez, 'The Proposal', June 18, 2009, Michael Ordona, Los Angeles Times, In some episodes he is described as the smartest in the office. Martinez refers to himself as being in the \\"Coalition for Reason\\" with Jim and Pam Halpert.Toby Flenderson was formerly a member, but Oscar states that Toby checked out mentally, and Toby seems to agree with him when asked about it, and as can be seen in the episode \\"Mafia\\", where Oscar is the only one to see that an Italian American insurance agent is simply an insurance agent. According to N√∫√±ez, the three \\"are there to set up the comic situations\\" for boss Michael and Dwight Schrute, Michael's toady. He explained, \\"We can still be funny but we are definitely the 'straight guys'.\\" He is often the one who is able to clearly see the reality and logic in situations, including financial ones such as when Michael started up his own paper company or Ryan Howard's online startup business. Because of this, Oscar is considered to be a know-it-all by many of his co-workers. Oscar is frequently exasperated by the antics of his coworkers and tends to find their humor offensive. He is reserved, not really exhibiting a desire for close contact with any of his co- workers, although he is friendly when not outwardly pedantic. In an AfterElton.com interview, N√∫√±ez explained he plays the character like an accountant, who happens to be gay, and just trying to do his work and not really interested in what the documentarians are filming. Actor N√∫√±ez references the character as a Log Cabin Republican, though no mention of this has occurred in the show.Oscar performance: He's a straight stripper or a strait-laced gay -- and he loves playing both, Bruce Kirkland, Toronto Sun, October 12, 2009, A Chat with Oscar N√∫√±ez of \\"The Office\\" on his character Oscar Martinez, Will Harris, November 12, 2008.

He and co- worker Kevin Malone seem to have a strong friendship with each other, often a dynamic where Oscar is often the calm, rational one while Kevin is the fun- loving one. Biography Oscar has worked at Dunder Mifflin since 1999. He is openly gay (after being publicly outed by Michael) and previously lived with his partner, Gil. Originally, Oscar was in the closet, and Gil was believed to be his roommate. In earlier seasons, he is seen driving a Saturn Ion. This is the same Saturn that Angela can later be seen driving, such as in the episode \\"Niagara\\". However, he is seen in the third season driving a Lexus RX 400h, a company car he was lent as a result of his unwanted outing by Michael. Though Oscar is openly gay in later episodes, in the episode \\"The Fire\\", when asked by Jim \\"Who would you do?\\", Oscar offers the answer, \\"Pam\\"; also, in \\"The Client\\", he makes an intentionally vague reference to a woman he previously dated. In a deleted scene from \\"Gay Witch Hunt\\", Oscar explains that he in fact notified Michael of his being gay during his job interview. This caused Michael to laugh repeatedly, and he hired Oscar on the spot because he was \\"the funniest person that [Michael] had ever met\\". Oscar then hid his sexuality from his co-workers (until he was outed) for fear of losing his job.Frederick Luis Aldama Latinos and Narrative Media: Participation and Portrayal 2013 1137361786- Page 16 \\"There is the Latino accountant, √ìscar Mart√≠nez, on NBC's The Office (2005‚Äì2012), who is outted by his boss, Michael.\\" References Category:Fictional accountants Category:Fictional gay males Category:The Office (American TV series) characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2005 Category:Atheism in television Category:Male characters in television Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television ","title":"Oscar Martinez (The Office)"},{"id":"8023120","text":"The N-111 is a highway in Spain.

He began his long and prolific film career in the early days of silent film.Screen captures of Dell Henderson in various screen appearances Biography Born in the Southwestern Ontario city of St. Thomas, Dell Henderson started his acting career on the stage, but appeared in his first movie Monday Morning in a Coney Island Police Court already in 1908. Henderson was a frequent associate of film pioneer D.W. Griffith since 1909 and appeared in numerous of his early shorts in Hollywood. He also acted on a less prolific basis in the movies of producer Mack Sennett and his Keystone Studios. In addition to acting, Henderson also directed nearly 200 silent films between 1911 and 1928.Pickford, Mary {copyright, 1916, by The McClure Newspaper Syndicate}. \\"Daily Talks by Mary Pickford\\" (The Day {New London, Connecticut}, November 1, 1916, page 11) Most of those films are forgotten or lost, but he also directed movies with silent stars like Harry Carey and Roscoe Arbuckle. Henderson also worked as a writer on numerous screenplays. After retiring from directing in 1927, Henderson turned to acting full-time and played important supporting roles in King Vidor's The Crowd (1928) and as General Marmaduke Pepper in Show People (1928). The advent of sound film damaged his acting career, and he often had to play smaller roles. In the 1930s, the comedic character actor appeared on several occasions as a comic foil for such comedians as The Three Stooges, W. C. Fields and Laurel and Hardy. He often played somewhat pompous figures like judges, businessmen, detectives or mayors. Modern audiences will remember Henderson as annoyed hospital president Dr. Graves in The Three Stooges film Men in Black (1934) and the put-upon chaperone in the Our Gang film Choo-Choo! (1932). He also appeared as a Night Court Judge in Laurel and Hardy's Our Relations (1936) and as a friendly Car salesman in Leo McCarey's drama Make Way for Tomorrow (1937). Henderson ended his film career after numerous small roles in 1950. Henderson died of a heart attack in Hollywood at the age of 79.Howard Maurer, Joan; (1984).

She was their only child. Her mother had been previously married and had several children from her first marriage who died young. Eva was educated at St. Mary's Convent (later St. Mary's Hare Park) in Gidea Park, London. In early 1912, Benjamin decided to take his family and emigrate to Winnipeg. =Aboard Titanic= Esther Hart was seven years old when she and her parents boarded the Titanic as second-class passengers on 10 April 1912 at Southampton, England. They had originally been booked on a ship called the Philadelphia but the coal strike at Southampton that spring kept it from sailing and many of her passengers were transferred to the Titanic. Almost instantly, her mother felt uneasy about the Titanic and feared that some catastrophe would happen. To call a ship unsinkable was, in her mind, flying in the face of God.Eva Hart, 91, a Last Survivor With Memory of Titanic, Dies, New York Times, 16 February 1996 With such fear, she slept only during the day and stayed awake in their cabin at night fully dressed.Biography, Encyclopedia Titanica Eva was sleeping when the Titanic struck the iceberg at 11:40 pm on 14 April. Her mother was awake at the time, and felt \\"a slight bump.\\" She immediately asked her husband to investigate this, and he left the cabin. Upon his return, he alerted her and Eva to the collision, and after wrapping her in a blanket, he carried her to the boat deck. He placed his wife and daughter in Lifeboat No. 14 and told Hart to 'be a good girl and hold Mummy's hand'. It was the last thing he ever said to her and the last time she ever saw him. She and her mother were picked up by the rescue ship RMS Carpathia and arrived in New York City on 18 April. Her father perished and his body, if recovered, was never identified.

She confronted her fears head-on by booking a ticket on a passenger ship heading to Singapore, and locking herself in her cabin for four straight days, until the stewardess made her get on the deck and the nightmares went away. =Memories of Titanic= In April 2012 an audio walking guide to Titanic memorials in Southampton, Hampshire, was produced featuring audio clips of Hart talking about her experience. The guide takes the listener on a walking route around Southampton, where the Titanic set sail on her maiden voyage. Being seven years old at the time of the sinking, she maintained several vivid memories. \\"We went on the day on the boat train. I was 7, I had never seen a ship before. It looked very big. Everybody was very excited. We went down to the cabin and that's when my mother said to my father that she had made up her mind quite firmly that she would not go to bed in that ship. She would sit up at night. She decided that she wouldn't go to bed at night and she didn't!\\" \\"I saw that ship sink,\\" she said in a 1993 interview. \\"I never closed my eyes. I didn't sleep at all. I saw it, I heard it, and nobody could possibly forget it. I can remember the colours, the sounds, everything,\\" she said. \\"The worst thing I can remember are the screams. It seemed as if once everybody had gone, drowned, finished, the whole world was standing still. There was nothing, just this deathly, terrible silence in the dark night with the stars overhead.\\" \\"The band played one version of 'Nearer My God to Thee' of which there are three and the one they played was the one that was played in church.

As a volunteer in World War II Hart organised entertainment for the troops and distributed emergency supplies to people after bombings in London. She was a member of Soroptimist International of East London from 1962 until her death. She was Club President during 1970-71 and a member for 34 years.

It was presented to her by the Duke of Kent during the Three-Day Week. =Outspoken criticism= Hart was one of the most outspoken survivors concerning the Titanic's lack of sufficient lifeboats and of any salvage attempts of the Titanic after its discovery in 1985 by Robert Ballard. She commonly criticised the White Star Line for failing to provide enough lifeboats for all aboard the Titanic. \\"If a ship is torpedoed, that's war,\\" she once said. \\"If it strikes a rock in a storm, that's nature. But just to die because there weren't enough lifeboats, that's ridiculous.\\" The official report of the British Inquiry suggests, however, that additional boats would not necessarily have made any difference. The crew did not properly launch all of the boats it had in the available time, and there was no boat drill and no advance information given to the crew on what should be done in the event of emergency.https://www.titanicinquiry.org/BOTInq/BOTReport/BOTRepBoats.php Hart was vocal in interviews about the ship having broken in half,Clark, Roger, Pres. \\"The Way It Was  Eva Hart.\\" Perf.

In 1994, she wrote an autobiography, Shadow of the Titanic ‚Äì A Survivor's Story, in which she described her experiences aboard the ship and the lasting implications of its sinking.

History  Established in 1892, the University of Colorado Law School is a charter member in the Association of American Law Schools and appeared in 1923 on American Bar Association's first ever publication of approved law schools. Although always located on the greater Boulder campus, the law school has occupied five buildings since its founding. For the first two years of its existence, the school was housed in the Kent building. From 1894 to 1909 the school occupied the Hale Law Building. For the next 50 years, until 1959, the school occupied the Guggenheim Law Building. From 1959 to 2005, the law school occupied the Fleming Law Building. In the fall of 2006, the law school once again moved and now sits in the Wolf Law Building.  The Wolf Law Building  By the late 1990s, Colorado Law had outgrown its building. In 1997 law students voted to tax themselves with a $1,000 per year tuition differential to help finance the building, but in 2001 the State of Colorado General Assembly rescinded its earmarked funds from the project. Facing the risk of accreditation loss, law students worked with campus leaders and successfully passed a $400 per year fee on all Boulder students to fund capital construction on the Wolf Law Building and three other campus projects. The Wolf Law Building was dedicated on September 8, 2006, by United States Supreme Court justice Stephen Breyer. The dedication ceremony represented the end of a long and creative funding process for a public law school. In addition to student funds, over $13 million in private gifts were donated to support the construction of the new law building. The Wolf family, in honor of Leon and Dora Wolf, were especially generous in their contribution to the new building that now bears their family name. The Wolf Law Building was constructed under the United States Green Building Council's LEED certification rating system for environmental sustainability and received a Gold rating. Colorado Law is the second law school to be housed in a certified LEED building.http://www.colorado.edu/law/about/wolf-law-building/leed-certified- building  Admissions  The school received 3,175 applications for the class of 2014 and matriculated 163 students. The 25th and 75th percentile LSAT scores for entering students are 160 and 165, respectively; the median LSAT is 164. The 25th and 75th percentile GPA for entering students are 3.41 and 3.79, with a median of 3.64.http://www.colorado.edu/law/details/ Employment According to Colorado's official 2015 ABA-required disclosures, 74.2% of the Class of 2015 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation. Colorado's Law School Transparency under-employment score is 8.8%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2015 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job nine months after graduation. Costs The total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at Colorado for the 2013-2014 academic year is $51,110 for residents and $58,620 for nonresidents. The Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance for three years is $197,814 for residents and $219,168 for nonresidents. =Controversial 2009 employment statistics= In October 2009, the journal Law Week Colorado stirred controversy when it reported that only 35% of the school's Class of 2009 had jobs at graduation.Ashby Jones (10/22/09) Absolutely Wretched‚Äô: One Prof‚Äôs Take on the State of Legal Ed Wall Street Journal. Retrieved 9-30-10.Debra Cassens Weiss (10/28/09) Law School Says Stats on Jobless Grads Were Wrong; Publication Differs ABA Law Journal. Retrieved 9-30-10. Officials from the school assailed the Law Week Colorado article. Former Assistant Dean of the Office of Career Development SuSaNi Harris called Law Week Colorado's report the product of a \\"miscalculation\\" and \\"misunderstanding\\" and claimed Law Week Colorado \\"confused 'employed' and 'unemployed.'\\" Later, Associate Dean Dayna Matthew told Law Week Colorado that the numbers released were \\"premature\\" and asserted that the National Association of Legal Professionals (NALP) would release more favorable statistics in February 2010. The reason, Matthew said, was that the NALP discounted graduates who did not report their employment status. For its part, Law Week Colorado stuck to its original statistics and noted that the University of Colorado had not provided any new statistics.  Ranking  In 2008, U.S. News & World Report ranked the University of Colorado Law School 32nd in the nation. In 2010, its ranking fell to 38th. In 2011, the school dropped to 47th, leading The Wall Street Journal to call the school \\"among the biggest fallers among the top 50\\".

(n√©e Martin; formerly Lipton) is a fictional character in the U.S. version of the television sitcom The Office, portrayed by actress Angela Kinsey. The character is based on Sheila from the original version of The Office. She is introduced as the senior accountant, head of the Party Planning Committee, and safety officer at the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin. Her character serves as the stuck-up and more professional face of the branch. She begins a relationship with co-worker Dwight Schrute, whom she begins secretly dating in the second season, has a child in the eighth, and marries in the ninth. This relationship continues during the fourth season while she is engaged to salesman Andy Bernard. She also has a short-lived marriage with Pennsylvania State Senator, Robert Lipton, who is initially believed to be the father of her child, Phillip. Dwight often referred to her as \\"Monkey\\" to keep their relationship a secret.  Casting  Kinsey initially auditioned for the role of Pam Beesly, which eventually went to Jenna Fischer. The casting director for the show, Allison Jones, said that Kinsey's portrayal of Pam was \\"too feisty.\\" Sometime later, the casting team offered Kinsey a role written for her named Angela Martin.  Character Biography  Angela Martin was born on November 11, 1974 in Dayton, Ohio. She has one sister named Rachael who is her best friend. In the series finale, she and her sister speak in a secret language they created when they were little. During a talking head in the episode \\"Performance Review,\\" she says that she \\"enjoys being judged\\" and that she participated in beauty pageants as a child. In \\"A Benihana Christmas,\\" Martin tells the documentary crew that she has a sister who she hasn't spoken to in sixteen years due to a small argument, but it is unknown whether this sister was Rachael. Angela has 12 cats over the course of the series, her favorites being Sprinkles (who is killed by Dwight Schrute in \\"Fun Run\\"), Princess Lady, and Garbage (who is gifted to her by Dwight as an apology). The other names of her cats are Ember, Milky Way, Diane, Lumpy, Petals, Mr. Ash, Phillip (the inspiration for her son's name), Bandit, and Comstock (who she gives away when she realizes her son is allergic to in \\"New Guys\\"). Over the series, she is seen to be very close to her cats. During \\"Lecture Circuit: Part 2,\\" fellow accountants Oscar Martinez and Kevin Malone see her communicating with her pets at her home via nanny cam. Angela is very petite and is constantly mocked by regional manager Michael Scott for it. During the episode \\"Women's Appreciation,\\" she tells the documentarian that she'll sometimes buy clothes for large, colonial dolls from the American Girl Doll store because \\"the clothes at the GAP Kids are too flashy.\\" She later reveals that she is 5'1\\" at her tallest. In the season one episode \\"Health Care,\\" Dwight confirms that she has dermatitis. At the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin, she is the senior accountant and was the head of the party planning committee (P.P.C.). She was replaced by Phyllis Vance in the fourth season finale as a use of blackmail. She was also the branch's safety officer until Dwight takes over sometime in the second season. Also in the second season, she begins a secret relationship with Dwight. This is first suspected by Pam Beesly in the episode \\"Email Surveillance,\\" where Angela is seen buying two candy bars, one for Dwight. It is also noticed by Jim Halpert in the episode \\"The Negotiation.\\" When at work, Angela and Dwight hook up in a supply closet in the branch's warehouse. She is also engaged to salesman Andy Bernard in the fifth season and married to Pennsylvania State Senator Robert Lipton in the eighth and ninth seasons. Throughout the series, Angela is shown to have very picky taste. While playing a game of Desert Island in the episode \\"The Fire,\\" she states that the books she would bring to a deserted island would be the Bible, The Purpose Driven Life, and The Da Vinci Code (just so that she could burn it). She is also seen to be a fan of Will & Grace (only the scenes with Harry Connick Jr.), the song \\"The Little Drummer Boy,\\" and posters of young children doing adult-like activities. She also notes that her famous male crush is Boris Becker. During the episode \\"Office Olympics,\\" she tells the documentarian that she likes playing games with her cats and singing. She dislikes the colors green and orange, apologizing, and Kevin. She is seen driving a first-generation Ford Focus Sedan in the second season and a second- generation Saturn S-Series in the sixth. During the fourth season, Andy offers several locations for their wedding including EPCOT Center, a Marriot Ballroom, and hot air balloon rides. She turns these all down and eventually requests to be married at Schrute Farms, Dwight's beet farm. However, when Andy suggests a retirement in Celebration, Florida, she happily agrees. Angela also states several times that she is vegetarian.  Character History  = Seasons 1-3 = Angela is first seen in the pilot episode in a corner of the office behind reception, where the accountants work, at the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin Paper. She is later revealed to be the senior account, the head of the Party Planning Committee (first seen in \\"The Alliance\\"), and the safety officer (seen in \\"Basketball\\"). She is very stuck-up and is a \\"tight-ass\\" according to Michael (\\"The Dundies\\"). While she has respect for Oscar's intelligence, they often quarrel over who is right in a discussion. She is also disgusted by Kevin, who is constantly filling out worksheets wrong and eating. She also has a power struggle with Dwight, who thinks that he is the safety officer. In a deleted scene from the season two opener, she tells the documentary crew that she is also the branch's designated driver. In the episode \\"Halloween,\\" she wears a white cat costume (she is seen wearing this same costume in a photo of her and Sprinkles). During \\"Email Surveillance,\\" Pam begins to suspect a relationship between Angela and Dwight. Her suspicion is proved to be correct when the two can be seen making out at Jim's party later that night, though Pam doesn't see them. In the next episode, \\"Christmas Party,\\" Angela plans the branch's annual Christmas party and is given a poster of two toddlers playing jazz instruments by Toby Flenderson. Later that season, Angela and Dwight once again have an argument about who will plan the Michael's birthday party. During \\"Conflict Resolution,\\" Michael finds that Angela has lodged several complaints against Dwight but that they were all removed six months prior, most likely because of their relationship. In the second episode of the third season, Dwight and Michael travel to a convention with Dunder Mifflin corporate and Angela secretly follows to surprise Dwight. The next episode, Dwight confides to Angela that while he is fond of Michael, he would be a better regional manager. Angela agrees and Dwight meets with Jan Levinson-Gould secretly to discuss the matter. Micheal finds out and tricks Dwight into thinking that he is no longer regional manager. Not knowing it's a prank, Dwight promises Angela the position of his right hand man. At the branch's Christmas party, Angela invites transferred employee Karen Filippelli to join the P.P.C. but quickly removes her, claiming that she has no good ideas. This leads Pam and Karen to form The Committee to Plan Parties and they create a margarita-karaoke Christmas party. This causes some tension between Angela and Pam, and Angela reveals to the camera that she never likes to apologize. Eventually, they decide to merge the parties and Angela sings her favorite song, \\"The Little Drummer Boy,\\" on the karaoke machine for the office. At Phyllis' wedding, Angela and Dwight slow-dance together outside the chapel. After Roy Anderson tries to attack Jim Halpart as revenge for kissing Pam on the office's casino night and Dwight saves Jim with a bottle of mace, Angela asks around the office to hear the story of Dwight's bravery. During \\"Product Recall,\\" Angela is temporarily in charge of answering phone calls due to an inappropriate water mark on Dunder Mifflin's stationary. When the women of the Scranton branch go to the Steamtown Mall (\\"Women's Appreciation\\"), Angela shops at the American Girl Store for clothes for \\"large, colonial dolls,\\" to fit her petite figure. = Seasons 4-5 = In the season four opener, Dwight offers to feed Angela's cat, Sprinkles, but ends up killing the cat instead. Though he tries to replace sprinkles with a farm cat named Garbage (who she later names Bandit), Angela breaks up with him. In an attempt to win her back, Dwight holds a battle against Dunder Mifflin's new website by trying to make more sales than it within the first hour of being launched. He beats the website's sales but Angela is unimpressed. In the end of the episode, Andy Bernard asks Angela out by singing \\"Take a Chance on Me\\" by ABBA. She accepts, much to Dwight's sadness. In the episode \\"Dinner Party,\\" Angela and Andy are invited to Michael's condo to have dinner with Pam, Jim and Jan. Tensions rise at the party and it only gets worse when Dwight shows up. In the season finale, Andy proposes to Angela in front of his parents and she reluctantly says yes. However, in the very end of the episode, Phyllis Vancecatches Angela and Dwight hooking up in the office. Throughout season five, Angela continues her secret romance with Dwight while engaged with Andy. Meanwhile, Andy spends most of the season trying to find the perfect wedding location, but most of them are turned down by Angela. They eventually settle on Schrute Farms, Dwight's beet farm. In \\"The Surplus,\\" Andy and Angela tour the farm and stage a fake wedding so Andy can see what the ceremony will look like. However, Dwight later reveals to her that he actually married them because they both said \\"I do.\\" Angela reacts angrily to this and makes him cancel it. In the next episode, Phyllis hosts her first Christmas party as head of the P.P.C. Angela gets fed up with Phyllis' demands and allows her to spill the secret about her and Dwight, not thinking Phyllis has the guts. However, Phyllis announces it very to the whole office, besides Andy who was in the annex. Andy soon finds out in the following episode, \\"The Duel.\\" Andy and Dwight plan a duel in the parking lot after work to decide who will get to keep Angela. In the end, they both realize that neither of them want Angela, and she is left single. Angela soon develops a crush on Charles Miner, a new employee at corporate, and battles with Kelly Kapoor for his attention. = Seasons 6-9 = In \\"The Delivery,\\" Dwight sees that Pam and Jim are using their unborn child as a selling point and decides that he would like to do the same. He suggests to Angela that they try to create a child together. Angela is excited by Dwight's sudden attention to her, but realizes that he just wants her to make a baby. In \\"Happy Hour,\\" Dwight blows off Angela to meet with Pam's sister, Isabel, which angers Angela. Soon after, Angela hires a mediator to go over the contract she and Dwight signed and realizes that he could be forced to give her $30,000. Knowing he cannot pay this, Angela gives Dwight a \\"settlement\\" of attempting to procreate five separate times. He agrees to this and they use a punchcard to keep track. In the third episode of the seventh season, Dwight reveals that he is no longer interested in Angela. However, he still takes her to a play Andy is performing in that evening. After the show, Dwight offers to use one of their five attempts but Angela clips the punchcard, happy enough with a simple date. In the end of \\"WUPHF.com,\\" Angela meets Pennsylvania State Senator, Robert Lipton, at Dwight's hay festival in the office parking lot. They hit it off and Angela decides to talk with the senator instead of meeting Dwight. In the season finale, Lipton proposes to Angela and she accepts. At the start of the eighth season, Angela is married to the senator and pregnant. While giving a speech at Andy's \\"Garden Party,\\" Angela reveals the name of her son to be Phillip, named after her favorite cat. In \\"Jury Duty,\\" Angela gives birth to her son and Dwight believes it to be his, though Angela denies this. In the eighth season finale, \\"Free Family Portrait Studio,\\" Dwight steals a full diaper from Angela to test Phillip's DNA. During the ninth season, Angela suspects that Robert may be cheating on her and asks Oscar to help her find out, not knowing that Oscar is dating Robert. Oscar takes Angela to her husband's yoga class where they see him flirting with multiple young men. They see him dialing his phone and Oscar's phone rings. Angela finds out the truth and goes to break off her marriage. Several episodes later, Dwight invites Angela to come to his house, though she learns it is to help take care of his grandmother. However, this friendship is ended when Dwight begins to date a beet farmer, just to make her jealous. In \\"A.A.R.M.,\\" Angela finally reveals to Dwight that he is indeed the father of Phillip and he proposes to her. She accepts and they are married in the series finale.  Reception  On FanSided, Patrick Schmidt describes Angela as \\"The cold-hearted head of accounting. A petite woman, she views her co-workers mostly as distractions. Angela is definitely not out to make friends. Often she shows open disdain for her co-workers, especially Kevin and Meredith.\\" Screen Rant said \\"While she'll always be known as the rudest one in the office, fans have to admit that she's a different woman by the series finale. She started joining the office shenanigans, made more small-talk with Pam, and dare we say smiled more.\\" References Category:Fictional accountants Category:The Office (American TV series) characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2005 Category:American female characters in television Category:Fictional characters from Ohio Category:Vegetarianism in fiction ","title":"Angela Martin"},{"id":"8023404","text":"Ian Smart (born February 28, 1980 in Kingston, Jamaica) is a CFL kick returner and running back who is currently a free agent.

She was launched on 10 November 1892 by New York Navy Yard; sponsored by Miss S. Mosby; and commissioned on 16 June 1894, Captain Henry Glass in command. She was the second ship to be named after Cincinnati, Ohio. Service history =Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War= Cincinnatis first cruise, along the east coast, and then in the Caribbean, found her enforcing neutrality laws at Tampa and Key West during the Cuban Revolution from September 1895 ‚Äì January 1896. From September 1896-July 1897, she served in the eastern Mediterranean, returning to the South Atlantic Station in September 1897. In April 1898, opening month of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Cincinnati, commanded by Captain Colby Mitchell Chester joined the blockade off Havana, Cuba, and bombarded Matanzas. The next month, she scouted throughout the West Indies searching for the Spanish fleet known to be approaching Cuba. At the close of May, Cincinnati came north for repairs, returning to the Caribbean for occupation duty in August. She convoyed troops from Guantanamo Bay to Puerto Rico, patrolled off San Juan, made a reconnaissance of Culebra Island, and escorted the captured Spanish flagship Infanta Maria Teresa until the prize of war sank en route to Norfolk from Cuba. On 8‚Äì9 August, Cincinnati provided illumination with her searchlights and naval gunfire to support bluejackets defending the Cape San Juan Light from a Spanish ground assault in the Battle of Fajardo.Annual Report of the Secretary of the Navy for the Year 1898, Appendix to the Report of the Chief of the Bureau of Navigation, p. 651 After joining in salvage operations at Santiago in November, she sailed north, and from 14 February 1899 ‚Äì 2 December 1901 was out of commission at New York Navy Yard for extensive repairs. =Pre-World War I= From May 1902-January 1903, Cincinnati protected American citizens and property in the Caribbean during political disturbances at Haiti, Santo Domingo, and Panama, and brought relief supplies to Martinique after the devastating eruption of Mount Pelee. From January‚ÄìMay 1903, the cruiser sailed in the Mediterranean, then passed through the Suez Canal for four years of duty on the Asiatic Station, based in the Philippines. Target practice, maneuvers, and goodwill cruises took her to many ports in China, Japan, and the Pacific islands, and from time to time she patrolled off Korea. She returned to Mare Island Navy Yard on 10 September 1907, and was decommissioned there on 12 October. =World War I and beyond= Recommissioned in reserve on 8 March 1911, Cincinnati was in full commission on 11 October 1911, and two months later returned to the Asiatic Station for a six-year tour of duty similar to her earlier employment there. She returned to San Diego on 16 December 1917, and while bound for the east coast took part in humanitarian relief at San Jose, Guatemala after severe earthquakes. She arrived in Hampton Roads on 16 January 1918.

The largest of those properties include: *Litchfield by the Sea *Willbrook Plantation *The River Club *The Reserve at Litchfield *Reserve Harbor Marina *Prince Creek (Murrells Inlet) *The Tradition (Centex Homes) After the company developed most of the land it owned, many properties and company divisions were sold or dissolved. The Litchfield Beach and Golf Resort, which includes the resort, hotel, Litchfield Racquet Club, and three golf courses is now owned and operated by Myrtle Beach National Company. Waccamaw Management, a division which handled property management and landscaping, was sold and currently manages properties throughout the Grand Strand, including most of the properties originally developed by TLCo. The Reserve Golf Club was purchased by its members, and now operates independently. Additionally, the Reserve Harbor Marina was purchased by Morningstar Marinas of Matthews, NC. It now operates as the Reserve Harbor Yacht Club.

An anti-shock body (also known as Whitcomb body or K√ºchemann carrot) is a pod positioned on the leading edge or trailing edge of an aircraft's aerodynamic surfaces. Its purpose is to reduce wave drag while travelling at transonic speeds (Mach 0.8‚Äì1.0), which is the typical cruising speed of conventional jet airliners. The anti-shock body was effectively a means of implementing the recently developed area rule. Developed during the early 1950s, it was used on the aircraft of various powers of the era, including the United States, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom. Examples of its implementation including the Tupolev Tu-16 and Handley Page Victor strategic bombers and the Convair 990 airliner. However, the anti-shock body has largely become unnecessary, and thus is rarely used, due to the emergence of other means of reducing wave drag, such as the supercritical wing. Theory The theory behind the anti- shock body was independently developed during the early 1950s by a pair of aerodynamists, Richard Whitcomb at NASA and Dietrich K√ºchemann at the British Royal Aircraft Establishment.Barnard and Philpott 2010, p. 254. The anti-shock body, which was alternatively referred to as \\"Whitcomb bodies\\" or \\"K√ºchemann carrots\\", is closely associated with the area rule, a recent innovation of the era to minimise wave drag by having a cross-sectional area which changes smoothly along the length of the aircraft. The design of the anti-shock body uses the Area Rule as its core operating principle, achieving a reduction in wave drag to improve fuel efficiency.Barnard and Philpott 2010, pp. 243-254. Specifically, it counteracts and breaks up drag-generating shock waves that are generally produced by the flow of air as it moves towards the trailing edge of the wing, reducing negative buffeting tendencies and increasing aerodynamic efficiency. Testing determined that such devices resulted in a significant drop in wave drag across various wing configurations. In addition to its traditional wave drag minimising function, anti-shock bodies can also serve a dual purpose as undercarriage bogie fairings, or for housing equipment such as chaff dispensers.ap Rees Air Pictorial June 1972, p. 222. In the Soviet Union, the anti-shock body was apparently developed at the TsAGI research institute. Implementations =Wing trailing edge= flap track fairing under the left wing of a Boeing 747-100 Multiple efforts to implement this new aerodynamic were quickly embarked upon. The anti-shock body was first applied within the Soviet Union to the Tupolev Tu-16, a strategic bomber that performed its first flight during April 1952. Anti-shock bodies were to remain a distinctive feature of present on many of Tupolev's other products, including the Tupolev Tu-154, a trijet airliner introduced during the early 1970s. In the west, anti-shock bodies appeared on multiple western aircraft of the mid to late 1950s, such as the Convair 990, an American jet- powered airliner that cruised at a speed of Mach 0.91. In the United Kingdom, later models of the Handley Page Victor, a strategic bomber operated by the Royal Air Force, was also furnished with the feature, which was sometimes referred to as \\"speed pods\\". However, modern jet aircraft harness supercritical airfoils, which decrease wave drag significantly. Further optimization can be achieved through careful design of wing body fairings, engine nacelles, flap track fairings, and wingtip fuel tanks. Due to the prevalence of supercritical airfoils, other design features with the sole purpose of minimising wave drag (such as the anti-shock bodies on the Convair 990) are rare in modern aircraft. =Leading edge root= Anti-shock body on the tail of a Hawker Sea Hawk The Hawker Sea Hawk, an early jet-powered ground attack aircraft, also made use of anti-shock bodies. During testing of the prototypes, a relatively high degree of tail drag was encountered when approaching transonic speeds. As a means of resolving this negative tendency, an anti-shock body was subsequently fitted to the leading edge of the junction between the vertical fin and tailplane.

Along with Thoros of Edessa, Gabriel was a former officer of Philaretos Brachamios. Philaretos had installed Gabriel as the ruler of Melitene. Following the death of Philaretos in 1086 Melitene became completely independent of Byzantine control with the aid of the Danishmends. Eventually the Danishmends began harassing Melitene. Gabriel appealed to Bohemund I of Antioch for assistance. In 1100 Bohemund came to Gabriel's aid along with his cousin Richard of Salerno and the Armenian Bishops of Marash and Antioch, but they were both captured and the Bishops slain by Danishmend Gazi, Emir of Sebastea, in the Battle of Melitene. Malik was now constantly raiding Gabriel's territories. Fearing an imminent attack on the city itself, Gabriel asked for help from Baldwin of Boulogne who had recently become King of Jerusalem, despite concerns that Baldwin might take over Melitene, as he did Edessa. Baldwin relieved the siege of Melitene and rescued Bohemund after which Gabriel recognized him as overlord of the city. Some sources state that Gabriel's wife was a daughter of Constantine I, Prince of Armenia; however, the dates simply do not allow for it. The confusion appears to stem from identifying Thoros I, son of Constantine with Thoros of Edessa, the latter of whom Gabriel is attested as being the father-in-law. Gabriel must have had some connection to the Greek culture, either via his mother or wife and, if that connection was to the family of Constantine I, it was most likely further back. His wife may have been a daughter of Constantine's father Roupen, for example; or she may have been a daughter of Philaretos, the general under whom Gabriel served, but this is only speculation. In any case, he was presumably known by his contemporaries and subjects to be descended from a prominent family that was acceptable to both the Greeks and to the Armenians, which could suggest a mixed heritage. Gabriel was disliked by a number of his subjects for his Eastern Orthodox faith. In 1101 Baldwin of Bourcq married Gabriel's daughter Morphia of Melitene, who later became Queen of Jerusalem. Gabriel, who was reputedly very wealthy, gave 50,000 gold bezants as a dowry. William of Tyre described Gabriel as Greek by religion, Armenian by race, language and custom. Byzantine seals bearing his name testify him as Gabriel, protonobelissimos and doux of Melitene. Beginning in 1103, the Danishmends again attacked Melitene. Gabriel asked the Crusaders for support, but they did not send help because they were negotiating with the Danishmends Emir at this time about the release of Bohemond. Melitene was conquered and Gabriel was captured. One of Gabriel's castles resisted the Turks. Gabriel was forced to give the crew of the castle the order to surrender. However, the garrison disobeyed his orders, and he was executed by soldiers of the sultan under the walls of the castle. Footnotes References *The Rupenides, Hethumides, and Lusignans, W. H.

A security community is a region in which a large-scale use of violence (such as war) has become very unlikely or even unthinkable. The concept of a security community is related to a group of states that enjoy relations of dependable expectations of a peace.Deutsch KW (1961) Security communities,In: Rosenau JN (ed.)International Politics and Foreign Policy: A Reader in Research and Theory. New York: Free Press, pp. 98‚Äì105. https://doi.org/10.1177%2F0010836713517570 The term was coined by the prominent political scientist Karl Deutsch in 1957. In their seminal work Political Community and the North Atlantic Area: International Organization in the Light of Historical Experience, Deutsch and his collaborators defined a security community as \\"a group of people\\" believing \\"that they have come to agreement on at least this one point: that common social problems must and can be resolved by processes of 'peaceful change. Peaceful change was defined as \\"the resolution of social problems, normally by institutionalized procedures, without resort to large-scale physical force\\". People in a security community are also bound by the \\"sense of community\\", the mutual sympathy, trust, and common interests. The concept has not become a mainstream term in the field of international security despite its long history. After the end of the Cold War, the concept of a security community was adapted by constructivist scholars. A major impetus was the book Security Communities (1998), edited by Emanuel Adler and Michael Barnett. They redefined the security community by shared identities, values, and meanings; many-sided direct interactions; and reciprocal long-term interest. Several regions of the world have been studied in the security community framework since then, most notably the European Union, the Canada‚ÄìUnited States and Mexico‚ÄìUnited States dyads, Mercosur, and Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). Michael Haas compared the Asian and Pacific Council, Asian-Pacific Parliamentarians Union, ASEAN, Indochinese Foreign Ministers Conference, South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the South Pacific Forum (later renamed the Pacific Islands Forum). Types of security communities Deutsch divided security communities into two types: the amalgamated and pluralistic ones. Amalgamated security communities are quite rare in history. They are created when two or more previously independent states form a common government. An example is the United States after the original thirteen colonies ceded much of their governing powers to the federal government. Amalgamation is not always successful and can be overturned, as the failed Union between Sweden and Norway exemplifies. An alternative and less ambitious process is called integration. Integration leads to a pluralistic security community, in which states retain their sovereignty. The United States with Canada is an example of a pluralistic security community. Both countries are politically independent, but they do not expect to have future military confrontations, in spite of having had some in the past. Deutsch argued that the pluralistic security communities are easier to establish and maintain than their amalgamated counterparts. Adler and Barnett described the typical evolution of a security community from nascent to ascendant to mature. A nascent security community meets the basic expectations of peaceful change, while a mature security community is also characterized by some collective security mechanisms and supranational or transnational elements. Adler and Barnett further divided the mature security communities into \\"tightly\\" and \\"loosely coupled\\", depending on the level of their integration. Raimo V√§yrynen and Andrej Tusicisny differentiated between interstate security communities (where war between states is unlikely) and comprehensive security communities (where both interstate conflicts and civil wars are seen as unthinkable). Western Europe is a classic example of a comprehensive security community, while South East Asia is usually seen as an interstate security community. Conditions leading to a security community The demilitarized border between Canada and the United States, two members of the North American security community. According to Deutsch, states may form a security community if the current state of the international system increases \\"unattractiveness and improbability of war among the political units concerned\\". For instance, security concerns led the United States and Mexico to form a pluralistic security community in anticipation of World War II. Deutsch identified two conditions that should facilitate formation of a pluralistic security community. The first one is \\"the capacity of the participating political units or governments to respond to each other's needs, messages, and actions quickly, adequately, and without resort to violence\\". One way states build this capacity is by common membership in international organizations. The second condition is the \\"compatibility of major values relevant to political decision-making\\". An example of a major politically relevant value given by Deutsch is political ideology. However, more recent empirical research showed that the often hypothesized role of liberal values and general trust in the development of security communities is overestimated. Another test, by Michael Haas, compared successful with unsuccessful security-community-oriented organizations, finding that the principal variable with a statistically significant relationship out of Deutsch's 12 variables was mutual compatibility of main values. Since amalgamation is more demanding than integration, Deutsch identified eight conditions that should be satisfied if amalgamation is to succeed: the mutual compatibility of main values, a distinctive way of life, capabilities and processes of cross-cutting communication, high geographic and social mobility, multiplicity and balance of transactions, a significant frequency of some interchange in group roles, a broadening of the political elite, and high political and administrative capabilities. In addition, the politically relevant strata of the population should be willing to accept and support common governmental institutions, remain loyal to them, and operate these common institutions with mutual attention to the messages and needs of all participating units. Carol Weaver has posited that, in order to arise and endure, security communities need to be based on balanced multipolarity.Weaver, C.\\"Black Sea Regional Security: present multipolarity and future possibilities\\", European Security,Vol. 20 (1), 2011, pp. 1-19.Weaver, C.\\"The Politics of the Black Sea Region: EU neighbourhood, conflict zone or future security community?\\", Ashgate Publishing,2013. Other uses The term security community may also refer to a policy community working on issues of security. It can be a hierarchical or networked group of professionals consisting, for instance, of politicians, military and civilian bureaucrats, and researchers. An example is the computer security community working on computer security.

The club is currently a Level 2 intercollegiate program and thus receives partial funding from the university. As the only Quebec university with a varsity rowing program, the club participates in the Ontario University Athletics (OUA) conference. It is a registered club with Rowing Canada. History The club dates back to 1924 when it originally operated out of the Lachine Boat Club. Within two years the club established a rivalry with the University of Toronto Rowing Club with the inception of the McGill-Toronto boat race. In the ten-year existence of the annual race McGill would only win the first two meetings. By 1939 both crews would cease activities with the outbreak of World War II. Rowing returned to McGill following the 1976 Summer Olympics with the revived club taking advantage of the then new Olympic Basin and its facilities. Initially only men crews raced with the first women crew taking to the water four years later in 1980. The following year the first Canadian University Rowing Championships (CURC) was held at the basin with McGill acting as hosts. The national championship returned to the basin in 2004, and again in 2009. In 2004 the men's eight won a silver medal, with current national team member Derek O'Farrell as bow seat. The 2009 event saw the women's lightweight coxed four score the Martlet's first ever medal (bronze), and the Redmen's first ever gold medal in the lightweight men's double won by Renaud Garon Gendron and Jonathan Rinaldi. In 2016, the legendary Nicholas Swanson Hutchison made his first appearance for the club. Club Colours The club colours are red and white matching the colours of the university. The blades are coloured red with two white triangles on the edge forming a sideways M. The logo is the McGill shield in front of two crossed McGill oars with the university's motto Grandescunt Aucta Labore (By work, all things increase and grow) on the bottom. Facilities The Olympic Basin on Notre Dame Island acts as the home waterways for the club sharing it and its facilities with the Montreal Rowing Club (MRC). Both clubs are run independently from each other although they do routinely support one another. These facilities include: *The 2000 metres-plus long basin itself, the only one of its kind in North America. *The indoor rowing tank, one of only two in Canada and the only one that can accommodate eight rowers. *Hangars used for storing rowing shells. The club also has an ergometer room at the Currie Gym, part of McGill's athletic complex. Additionally, athletes have access to the varsity weight room as well as other services. McGill-Queen's Boat Race Since 1997 McGill crews have taken on crews from Queen's University in the annual McGill-Queen's Challenge. Considered the Canadian equivalent of the famed Cambridge-Oxford and Harvard- Yale boat races, it takes place in late April alternating between Montreal and Kingston. The 2006 race was hosted by McGill which chose the Lachine Canal as the venue. Reviews were so positive that there has since been talks of making it the permanent home of the race. As of 2018, the race has not been held for a number of years, due to logistical challenges involving exam schedules. The men race for the Challenge Blade, a port side blade painted with Queen's colours on the inside and McGill colours on the outside. The women compete for the Challenge Trophy which is adorned with the wood handle of a sweep oar. The overall winner receives the D. Lorne Gales Challenge Cup named after original McGill rower D.

The most widely distributed member of its genus, this species poses a serious medical problem in many parts of its range. Currently, seven subspecies are recognized, including the nominate subspecies described here. Description and Behavior This large Neotropical rattlesnake grows to a length of , and rarely to a maximum length of . It has two distinct stripes starting at the base of the head. Within the lines, the color is lighter than the stripes. The color and pattern of the body are quite variable, most with an 18-32 dorsal with a darker diamond, and rhombic spots, 25-33 (usually 27) rows of dorsal scale in the middle of the body. The head has a dark brown bar at the top, with a dark post-orbital band. The color of the belly varies, it can be white or yellowish, with light gray spots, becoming darker towards the tail. The tail is usually gray, with dark and vague crossed bands. This species is more active at dusk and in the early hours of the morning, it is not aggressive towards humans, it raises its head and front one third of the body, in a vertical loop in the shape of S . https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/afpmb/docs/lhd/venomous_animals_byspecies.pdf  Reproduction  The South American rattlesnake has a seasonal reproductive cycle, copulation occurs in the fall and the birth of the young in the summer, with the males competing for the female.https://bdtd.ibict.br/vufind/Record/USP_44d1b15f186a6cdfe9edd4543831a83d#:~:text=Crotalus%20durissus%20possui%20um%20ciclo%20reprodutivo%20sazonal%20com%20c%C3%B3pula%20ocorrendo,machos%20competem%20por%20f%C3%AAmeas%20receptivas. Reproduction is Ovoviviparous, giving birth to 4-8 pups.  Diet  The diet consists mainly of rodents, possibly due to the greater abundance and availability of these prey throughout the year in areas where this species occurs, lizards of the Teiidae family are also part of the diet of C. durissus. Common names Common names for this species include: South American rattlesnake, tropical rattlesnake, neotropical rattlesnake,U.S. Navy. 1991. Poisonous Snakes of the World. US Govt. New York: Dover Publications Inc. 203 pp. . Guiana rattlesnake (previously used for C. d. dryinus).Brown JH. 1973. Toxicology and Pharmacology of Venoms from Poisonous Snakes. Springfield, Illinois: Charles C. Thomas. 184 pp. LCCCN 73-229. . and in Spanish: v√≠bora de cascabel, cascabel, cascabela, and also in Portuguese, cascavel. In Suriname it is known as Sakasneki. Geographic range Crotalus durissus is found in South America except the Andes Mountains. However, its range is discontinuous, with many isolated populations in northern South America, including Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana and northern Brazil. It occurs in Colombia and eastern Brazil to southeastern Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and northern Argentina (Catamarca, C√≥rdoba, Corrientes, Chaco, Entre Rios, Formosa, La Pampa, La Rioja, Mendoza, Misiones, San Juan, San Luis, Santa Fe, Santiago del Estero and Tucum√°n). Also, it occurs on some islands in the Caribbean, including Morro de la Iguana, Tamarindo and Aruba. The type locality given is \\"America.\\" Habitat It prefers savanna and semi-arid zones. It has been reported to occur in littoral xerophilous scrub, psammophilous and halophilous littoral grassland, thorny xerophilous scrub, tropophilous deciduous and semideciduous scrub, as well as tropophilous semideciduous seasonal forest in the northwest of Venezuela. In the Chaco region of Paraguay, it is found in the drier, sandier areas. Venom C. d. terrificus in Avar√©, S√£o Paulo, Brazil Bite symptoms are very different from those of Nearctic species due to the presence of neurotoxins (crotoxin and crotamine) that cause progressive paralysis. Bites from C. d. terrificus in particular can result in impaired vision or complete blindness, auditory disorders, ptosis, paralysis of the peripheral muscles, especially of the neck, which becomes so limp as to appear broken, and eventually life- threatening respiratory paralysis. The ocular disturbances are sometimes followed by permanent blindness. Phospholipase A2 neurotoxins also cause damage to skeletal muscles and possibly the heart, causing general aches, pain, and tenderness throughout the body. Myoglobin released into the blood results in dark urine. Other serious complications may result from systemic disorders (incoagulable blood and general spontaneous bleeding), hypotension, and shock. Hemorrhagins may be present in the venom, but any corresponding effects are completely overshadowed by the startling and serious neurotoxic symptoms. Acute renal failure is considered as the main cause of death.https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/5/5148/tde-10042007-141228/publico/FabiaMariaOliveiraPinho.pdf The mortality rate of cases without specific serum treatment is 72%, and 11% in cases with specific treatment. The LD50 value is 0,047 mg/kg(IV), 0,6 mg/kg(SC), 0,048 mg/kg(IP) and 1,4 mg/kg(IM). Other reported SC values include 0.171 and 0.193 mg / kg. Taxonomy The Guiana rattlesnake, previously recognized as C. d. dryinus, is now considered a synonym for C. d. durissus. In fact, after the previous nominate subspecies for the C. d. durissus complex became the current nominate for Crotalus simus, which now represents its Mexican and Central American members, C. d. dryinus became the new nominate for the South American rattlesnakes as represented by C. durissus. The subspecies previously known as C. d. collilineatus and C. d. cascavella were moved to the synonymy of C. d. terrificus following the publication of a paper by W√ºster et al. in 2005. =Subspecies= References Further reading * Alvaro ME. 1939.

In 1954, the laboratory joined the newly formed scientific and industrial association, named EKRAN. Until 1987, this laboratory did research and design for microphones for the Soviet film, broadcast and defense industries. Notable microphones from this era include the LOMO 19A19. =Nevaton= In 1991, Nevaton LTD Enterprise was founded entirely by former LOMO engineers as a new and independent microphone manufacturer and research laboratory. The Nevaton facility in St. Petersburg contains a well-equipped acoustic laboratory, including one of Europe's largest anechoic chambers, as well as a small specialized factory where each microphone is hand-assembled by engineers. All microphone components, including brass housings, capsules, and XLR connectors, are manufactured in-house. Nevaton microphones are individually tuned, and tested and measured with Br√ºel & Kj√¶r equipment. The microphones run through several testing routines before they are delivered to customers. On average, only 15 units leave the factory each month. The famous film studios Lenfilm and Mosfilm, theatres and opera houses like the Mariinsky Theatre, St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra, Moscow New Opera, TV and radio stations are Nevaton's regular customers as well as major sound-production studios.

In the Third and Fourth Styles of Roman interior wall paintings, a pinax was a painted framed picture usually in the Main Zone of the wall surface. Other uses Terracotta pinax of Persephone and Hades from Locri (Museo Nazionale di Reggio di Calabria) To the ancient Greeks pinax seems also to have been a general term for a plate, but this is generally not followed in modern archaeological usage. In daily life pinax might equally denote a wax- covered writing tablet. In Christian contexts, painted icons (\\"images\\") are pinakes. In the theatre of ancient Greece, they were images probably usually painted on cloth, but also carved either in stone or wood, that were hung behind, and sometimes below, the stage area as scenery, or as permanent decoration. The term pinacotheca for a picture gallery derives from such usages. Materials and use Terracotta funerary pinax, Athens, 560-550 BC When they are recovered by archaeologists, painted wooden pinakes have usually lost all but faint traces of their painted images - the Pitsa panels being the outstanding exception.Boardman, 69-70 Moulded terracotta pinakes were also brightly painted. Marble pinakes were individually carved, but terracotta ones were impressed in molds, and bronze ones might be repeatedly cast from a model from which wax and resin impressions were made, in the technique called lost wax casting. A few elaborate gold plaques have survived from the 7th century BC, many made in Rhodes, with deity figures, especially Artemis, shown in an orientalizing Daedalic style.Boardman, 33 They often have two holes for a suspension cord, and are shown in vase-paintings both hanging on temple walls, and also suspended from trees in the sanctuary area. The Roman architect Vitruvius mentions the pinakes in the cellas of temples, and even in the possession of private persons. Such a collection was a pinakothek,Compare bibliothek, a library, which provides the designation in several modern European languages. which is a modern German term for an art museum, such as the Alte Pinakothek of Munich. Callimachus, the Alexandrian poet and scholar at the Library of Alexandria, formed a kind of index, or \\"map picture\\" of the library's contents, which he named Pinakes,Christian Jacob, \\"From Alexandria to Alexandria: Scholarly Interfaces of a Universal Library\\" 2002. a term that continued in use in bibliographic catalogs. Large finds Pottery kiln, Penteskouphia At Locri in southern Italy, thousands of carefully buried pinakes have been recovered, most of them from the sanctuary of Persephone or that of Aphrodite.Boardman, 127; The Pinakes of Locri Another large group of over 1,000 pottery pinakes was found at the site of Penteskouphia, just outside Corinth. These are mostly in the Antikensammlung Berlin, with some in Corinth and the Louvre. As well as the usual religious scenes, some of these show depictions of potters at work.Louvre, \\"Votive tablet\\" Berlin also has a smaller group of fragments from the Kerameikos cemetery in Athens, many by the painter Exekias.Commons category \\"Pinakes by Exekias at the Antikensammlung Berlin\\" Etruscan art In Etruscan art, rather larger terracotta plaques than are typical in Greek art have been found in tombs, some forming a series that creates in effect a portable wall-painting. Wealthy Etruscan families often had tombs with painted walls, which the Greeks did not. The \\"Boccanera\\" tomb at the Banditaccia necropolis at Cerveteri contained five panels almost a metre high set round the wall, which are now in the British Museum. Three of them form a single scene, apparently the Judgement of Paris, while the other two flanked the inside of the entrance, with sphinxes acting as tomb guardians. They date to about 560 BC.

The cruiser was commissioned on 20 July 1893 with Commander Willard Herbert Brownson in command. It was the third ship to be named for Detroit, Michigan. Brazilian Naval Revolt Detroit in the Guanabara Bay, during the Rio de Janeiro Affair at the Brazilian Naval Revolt (L'Univers illustr√©, Levy (Paris), n¬∫ 2.029, 10 February 1894). Detroit sailed from Norfolk 5 October 1893 for Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and lay at anchor in the harbor to protect American citizens and interests during revolutionary disturbances in Brazil, during which she engaged the rebel cruiser Trajano in a short and bloodless action. After, Detroit returned to Norfolk, Virginia on 24 April 1894. She sailed on 16 October to serve on the Asiatic Station for two years, cruising along the Chinese coast, and visiting ports in Japan and Korea.

Stanley shows minor concern for Michael in \\"Two Weeks,\\" when he advises Michael that he should go to his office and start hunting for a job, given that Michael only has four days left with the company.Episode \\"Two Weeks\\" In \\"Casual Friday,‚Äù when Michael re-joins the branch, Stanley joins Dwight's mutiny against Michael, when he refuses to give back the clients the Michael Scott Paper company has stolen. \\"Gossip\\" involves Michael finding out from an intern that he has seen Stanley cheating Teri with a woman named Cynthia (Algerita Wynn Lewis). Michael, in a failed attempt to cover for Stanley, subsequently reveals to Teri that Stanley has the affair, and a furious Stanley smashes Michael's car with a lug wrench; he then begins dating Cynthia directly. In \\"Niagara\\", Stanley gives the toaster originally for Pam and Roy to Pam and Jim for their wedding. In \\"New Leads\\", Stanley, along with the rest of the sales staff, lets Sabre's new \\"sales is king\\" policy go to his head. When the sales staff acknowledges their cocky behavior, they plan to offer the non-sales staff some pastries and 2% of their commissions. However, before mentioning their commissions offer, the non-sales staff seem to be just happy with the pastries and they accept their apology, so the sales staff withholds their commissions offer. Stanley almost gives away that they were planning to give 2% of their commissions to them (since he walked in the room after the non-sales staff simply accepted the pastries), but Jim quickly interrupts him and covers up his comment. When Stanley figures out what has happened, he smiles and is glad that everyone is getting along again without having to give up some of his commission.Episode \\"New Leads\\" =Seasons 7‚Äì8= In \\"Costume Contest\\", Stanley accidentally confuses Jim's mug of orange juice for his own mug of coffee, but does not appear to notice the difference. This leads a surprised Jim, along with the rest of the office, to determine what else Stanley won't notice. Kevin dresses as Phyllis; Andy sits at his desk while wearing a tie with no shirt; Jim places a cardboard box with the computer desktop on it over Stanley's monitor; Michael wears fake teeth; Michael talks about a Dunder Mifflin branch on Jupiter during a staff meeting where all the employees except Stanley is facing a different direction; Pam wears a mustache; and Dwight brings a pony into the office. Stanley did not realize any of those things happened. However, he does notice that the office clock behind him is five minutes slow, and that it's actually 5 p.m., so he immediately heads out of the office. In \\"WUPHF.com\\", he tells the camera \\"I want to own a decommissioned lighthouse, and I want to live at the top. And nobody knows I live there, and there's a button that I can press that will launch that lighthouse into space.\\" He plays the Narrator in Michael's movie \\"Threat Level Midnight\\". In \\"Michael's Last Dundies\\", Stanley screams at Michael and Deangelo to get off his property when they deliver his Dundie nomination early in the morning. At the Dundies, Stanley laughs at Michael portraying Phyllis as being an old, enfeebled woman in the opening video in which Michael plays various employees around the office. Later, Stanley is not amused when he wins the diabetes award. He also participates in serenading the soon-to-depart Michael with a version of \\"Seasons of Love\\" with altered lyrics.Episode \\"Michael's Last Dundies\\" In \\"Special Project\\", when Dwight needs to form a team to go to Florida, Stanley jumps at the opportunity just so he can go to Florida for a month without his family, referring to himself as \\"Florida Stanley\\" in the interview, and makes it on the team. When in Florida, he rents a convertible and hooks up with other women at night, appearing quite happy. Jim initially likes hanging out with Stanley, but Stanley's actions drive Jim away. Stanley goes back to his old grumpy self when they leave Florida. =Season 9= In \\"The Target\\", Stanley and Phyllis agree to cover some of Jim's duties when Jim starts working part-time in Philadelphia. He does so only after making Jim treat him to a sumptuous lunch of lobster and wine. In \\"Finale\\" it is revealed that after the airing of the documentary, Stanley retired from Dunder Mifflin, divorced his wife, and moved to a small quiet village in Florida where he's taken up wood carving birds. During Dwight's wedding he dances with Phyllis and tells her that he misses seeing her every day. Stanley gives her a wood carved bird in her likeness as a gift.

The Roman Singilis, its modern name derives from the Moorish rendering of the Roman name: Sinyil, Sannil, and Sinnil. Route The source of the Genil is in the Sierra Nevada, north of its highest peak Mulhac√©n. The Genil flows through the towns Granada, Loja, Puente Genil and √âcija. It flows into the Guadalquivir River near Palma del R√≠o. Its main tributary is the Darro. It is joined by the Cac√≠n River to the southwest of Villanueva Mes√≠a. Geological history The river today drains the Granada basin. In the latest Tortonian and the middle and late Turolian (9.0‚Äì5.3 Ma) this was an endorheic basin. Rivers flowed from the east and southwest into a central lake with no exit. During the Pliocene, the western part of the basin was drained by the paleo-Cac√≠n river system, which flowed to the north and then left the basin to the west. The eastern part was drained by the Alhambra system, or paleo-Genil system, was fed by the mountains to the east and fed a small endorheic lake in the north. Some time later, the Genil river changed course to flow west, where it joined the paleo-Cacin system, and the basin became exorheic.

It is based on a true story by Susan Burton first told on the public radio show This American Life, under the title \\"In the Event of an Emergency, Put Your Sister in an Upright Position\\".Episode #175: \\"Babysitting\\" , This American Life. The film was released on December 8, 2006 by Warner Bros. Pictures, and grossed $21.9 million against a $26 million budget. Plot Spencer Davenport and his sister Katherine must fly from California to Pennsylvania on Christmas Eve to spend the holidays with their dad. During their layover at the Hoover International Airport in Washington DC, a massive blizzard grounds all planes and cancels all flights, and the siblings are sent to the anarchic UM (Unaccompanied Minors') room, where they meet Christmas-spirited smarty-pants Charlie Goldfinch, surly tomboy Donna Malone, arrogant rich girl Grace Conrad, and mysterious Beef Wellington. Charlie, Spencer, Beef, Grace, and Donna sneak out, and proceed to enjoy themselves around the airport. When they are caught by the airport security guards and returned to the UM room, they find that the other minors, Katherine included, have been sent to a lodge down the road, and that the grouchy head of passenger relations, Oliver Porter ‚Äî whose trip to Hawaii is among the canceled flights ‚Äî intends for the kids to spend Christmas Eve in the UM room. Knowing that it will break Katherine's faith in Santa Claus if she does not receive a present by the next morning, Spencer asks the others to help him get a present for his sister in return for a plan to escape. With Spencer's plan, the minors give Zach Van Bourke, the friendly clerk watching them, the slip, but Mr. Porter grows desperate to get the kids back, and sends all the airport guards to find them. After Donna and Grace get into a fight, Spencer decides that they're going to have to put their differences aside and work together, and Beef leaves to go and get a Christmas tree. Along the way, he reflects on how his step-father, Ernie, hoped to make him stronger by saying men are made, not born. Meanwhile, Spencer and Katherine's father tries to drive to the airport in his biodiesel fueled car, but it eventually breaks down at a gas station. However, the owner lets him borrow a Hummer. The minors head to a thinly secured exit in the back of the airport, letting a dog loose to distract the guards. While they hide from Mr. Porter in the baggage claim, Charlie, who is hiding in a suitcase, gets placed on a conveyor transport; Donna goes after him, putting herself on a wild ride. Spencer and Grace follow them to the unclaimed baggage warehouse, where they find many wonderful presents, including a set of walkie-talkies, and a doll for Katherine. However, they are seen dancing to Lee Morgan's performance of The Sidewinder on security cameras, and Mr. Porter and the guards chase the minors through the warehouse. Using a canoe, the minors take Zach captive and sled to the lodge while pursued by the guards, and manage to elude Mr. Porter long enough to find Katherine asleep in the lobby, and place the doll in her arms. While running around the lodge, Grace has to remove her contact lenses and put on glasses, which made her look like a dork in the past (but not to Spencer). With their mission completed, the minors go back to the airport with Mr. Porter quietly. They are placed under surveillance in separate rooms. Using the walkie-talkies, the minors tamper with the security cameras and escape through air ducts. They find the Christmas decorations Mr. Porter confiscated, and Beef returns with a huge Christmas tree that he traded his prized Aquaman action figure for. With Zach's help, the minors decorate the airport, and take items from the unclaimed baggage warehouse to use as presents for the rest of the stranded passengers. Mr. Porter finds Spencer to admit defeat and reveals that he's unhappy because he never really gets to spend time with his family during Christmas. Spencer inspires some holiday spirit in the man with some friendly words and the gift of a snow globe. On Christmas morning, Mr. Porter dresses up as Santa Claus to hand out presents to the passengers, Spencer reunites with Katherine, their father arrives to pick them up, Beef tells a girl about his trek to find a Christmas tree, Charlie and Donna exchange phone numbers and share a kiss, and Grace accepts Spencer's invitation to spend Christmas with him and his family.

She is portrayed by Phyllis Smith, and has no specific counterpart in the British version of the series, instead being an amalgamation of several different characters from that series. Biography Phyllis Lapin is a sales representative at fictitious paper distributor Dunder Mifflin. She is a quiet but friendly type who loves \\"girl talk\\" and gossip. Though she has a sweet, motherly exterior, she can sometimes be very vindictive, often to Angela Martin. She is often insulted and embarrassed by branch manager Michael Scott, who frequently describes her as non-feminine and old, despite having been classmates with her in high school. She was also apparently very promiscuous in high school, which resulted in an unplanned pregnancy. The baby was given up for adoption, and was first mentioned in the season seven episode \\"Goodbye, Michael\\", where Michael said he knew a secret about Phyllis but apparently did not know about the baby. Erin Hannon later approached Phyllis to take a maternity test since she was born in the same year and area as her child, but the test came back negative. She is married to Bob Vance of Vance Refrigeration; she affectionately refers to him as \\"Bobby\\", but frequently uses his full name, \\"Bob Vance\\" while talking to others. In the Season 7 finale, Phyllis reveals that she got Bob to notice her by waiting in his office every morning wearing nothing but kitty-cat ears for two weeks, and on the tenth day, he was naked too, except for a dog nose. Phyllis serves on the Party Planning Committee where she often butts heads with hypercritical Angela Martin, whom Phyllis told to her face that she does not like. She suffered from scoliosis as a child and went on to play high school basketball. She is Lutheran (Fun Run). It is implied she suffers from depression. In \\"Michael's Last Dundies\\" it is revealed she has diabetes. Seasons 1‚Äì2 Phyllis volunteered to be on the basketball team but Michael said no. When she suggested being a cheerleader instead, Michael placed her as an alternate player.Season 1 She is the winner of the \\"Busiest Beaver\\" award at the 8th Annual Dundie Awards, although due to an error her statue reads \\"Bushiest Beaver.\\" Phyllis admits that if she could sleep with one person in the office, it would be Jim Halpert. Phyllis also shocks the room during a \\"sexual harassment\\" seminar, by asking if one-night stands are included in a rule requiring reporting office romances to human resources. Phyllis won a gold medal in the invented \\"Flonkerton\\" event at the Office Olympics. She gives Michael a homemade oven mitt for Secret Santa which Michael hates, prompting him to start a game of Yankee Swap to get rid of it. Boyfriend Bob Vance comes to the Christmas party and sends her several large bouquets of flowers and a giant teddy bear on Valentine's Day. Seasons 3‚Äì4 In \\"Gay Witch Hunt\\", Phyllis tells the office that everyone thought Michael was gay in high school. When Michael suggests she might be a lesbian, Phyllis announces to everyone that she is marrying Bob Vance. Karen accidentally offends her by saying the perfume Bob gave her smelled like a funeral home (something Stanley had thought for years) and not knowing who Bob Vance is. When the party planning committee splits up, she stays with Angela at the less popular party but they ultimately join the other one. Angela is also seen openly insulting Phyllis by stating that orange was a more \\"whorish\\" color than green when Phyllis was wearing an orange sweater (a running insult that includes another Phyllis' clothing color-equals-whoring jab from Angela and Ms. Martin's pointed comments about Phyllis wearing a pristine white dress at her wedding). Belying her subdued nature, Phyllis is a shrewd saleswoman. In \\"Traveling Salesmen\\", Phyllis strategically gives Karen and herself a beauty makeover to mimic the appearance of a client's wife. She also tells Karen that Jim was in love with Pam for a long time, but is glad that Karen is dating him, but doesn't notice that the Jim-Pam information is not good news to Karen. Phyllis marries long- time boyfriend Bob Vance, whom she often refers to as \\"Bobby.\\" She reluctantly puts Michael in charge of rolling her wheelchair-using father down the aisle, in hopes that giving him a job in the ceremony will allow her a six-week honeymoon vacation. She also takes most of Pam's ideas originally to be used for her own wedding (down to using the same invitation, featuring the same \\"P & R\\" heading‚Äîonly standing for \\"Phyllis and Robert\\" rather than \\"Pam and Roy\\"), making Pam feel as if she has been invited to her own wedding. At the wedding, Michael reveals that Phyllis's nickname in high school was \\"Easy Rider\\". In a deleted scene from \\"Business School\\", it is revealed that Phyllis is currently on her honeymoon and will not be back for six weeks, which Stanley is ecstatic about. Phyllis returns from her honeymoon in \\"The Negotiation\\". It's also revealed in this season that Phyllis has a small crush on Jim. In a deleted scene in Traveling Salesmen, she tells Karen that Jim \\"is so hot\\", and goes on ask Karen if he wears boxers or briefs. Also, in a deleted scene in Beach Games, she calls Jim \\"eye candy\\", comparing his looks to that of George Clooney (which may be a reference to the film Leatherheads which was being filmed at the time and featured John Krasinski, who plays Jim, and George Clooney).Season 3 In a deleted scene from \\"Fun Run,\\" Phyllis is shown teaming up with husband Bob Vance (who is wearing a Vance Refrigeration T-shirt while the other racers wear Dunder Mifflin T-shirts) to pull ahead of Michael in the race. When they are unable to do it together, Phyllis encourages Bob to take care of it himself, screaming, \\"Go get him, Bobby! Sic him! Sic him!\\" In \\"Dunder Mifflin Infinity\\", after hearing Jim Halpert and Pam Beesly are dating, she passive-aggressively reminds Pam she can not give Jim any special treatment on sales leads just because he's \\"who you're sleeping with that week.\\" In \\"Launch Party\\", Phyllis googles ways to handle difficult people, namely Angela. When Angela points out to Phyllis that she made a spelling mistake in the sign \\"Lunch Party\\" and bought the wrong plastic utensils, Phyllis attempts to calmly reason with her, which only infuriates Angela to insult Phyllis further. Later on, Phyllis confronts her with numerous Post-It notes stuck onto her fingertips containing Angela's demands, claiming she can only fulfill one, not all of them. When Angela insults her again, Phyllis crumples all the notes into one ball and throws it at Angela's face. Afterwards, Phyllis says proudly, \\"That seemed to shut her up.\\" In \\"Local Ad\\", Michael sends her to the Steamtown Mall to try and recruit famous author \\"Sue Grafton\\" for his planned Dunder Mifflin TV ad, but Phyllis comes back sobbing in dismay because her failed attempt to talk to Grafton led to security guards throwing her out of the mall. In \\"Survivor Man\\", Phyllis gleefully notes that Michael was not invited to Ryan's corporate wilderness retreat while Toby was. Later on, when Jim is making stupid suggestions for the office birthday parties and finally demands a meeting on the subject, Phyllis mistakenly calls him \\"Michael\\" and Jim is horrified. In \\"Goodbye, Toby\\" (the season finale), Phyllis takes over the Party Planning committee from Angela in order to organize Toby's farewell party to Michael's specifications. In the final scene of the episode, Phyllis comes back inside the office following the party and catches Angela and ex-boyfriend Dwight Schrute having sex on one of the desks, despite the fact that Angela's boyfriend and co-worker Andy Bernard proposed to her at the party and she accepted. This made Phyllis the fourth person made aware of the intimate relationship between Dwight and Angela, after Pam, Jim and Ryan found out along the way.Season 4 Seasons 5‚Äì6 In the fifth-season premiere, \\"Weight Loss,\\" it is revealed that Phyllis has parlayed her secret knowledge of Dwight and Angela's renewed affair into the head spot on party-planning committee, which allows a role reversal in the group's meetings; Phyllis is shown calling the shots about party details, to which Angela quietly, if grudgingly, acquiesces. In \\"Baby Shower\\" Phyllis gloats further about gaining the party- planning spot, and specifically about having Angela at her mercy. Michael, however, interrupts her interview with the documentary crew and orders her to \\"make the party\\" for Jan Levenson, haranguing her to blow up balloons faster. In \\"Crime Aid\\", Phyllis attempts to counsel Dwight on reuniting with Angela, suggesting he give her an ultimatum to break up with Andy. When Angela rejects Dwight and Phyllis says that it is over, Dwight tries desperately to sway Phyllis's view. He even lets the air out of the tires on her Chevy Malibu to get her out of the auction. He reacts rudely to Phyllis's rejection of his plans, but he later apologizes (in his unique way), realizing she was trying to help, by bidding on Phyllis' hug which she offered in the Auction (her husband Bob Vance pays $1000 for the hug). In \\"Moroccan Christmas\\", Phyllis organizes an elaborate Christmas party featuring a hookah, sitar, hummus, and other trappings. She continues to get revenge on Angela, and takes delight in forcing Angela to lug the Christmas tree in and out of the building as well as allowing only the camel, elephant, and Arab King of her nativity scene to be displayed. Phyllis says that it's not really blackmail because that would involve an official letter. When Angela pathetically asks for some mercy from Phyllis, Phyllis accurately says Angela never showed her any mercy in the past. Angela later tells Phyllis to shut up and says Phyllis won't out her and Dwight because that would cost her the PPC leadership, but Phyllis makes good on her promise to reveal Angela and Dwight's affair to the entire office (except Andy, Meredith, and Michael who were absent). Phyllis' joy over seeing Angela's hypocrisy exposed is visibly tempered by her sadness when clueless Andy sings the office a jubilant holiday song. In \\"Stress Relief\\" Dwight simulates a fire which causes an office-wide panic and Stanley to suffer a heart attack. Corporate orders Dwight to issue a written apology and have all the office sign and approve it. Dwight, however, is openly insincere about his apology, as he believes Stanley's poor health decisions are to blame for his heart attack, and consequently, the office refuses to sign it. Through either bribing or tricking his coworkers, Dwight is able to get the signature of everyone in the office except Phyllis, who is especially angry at Dwight for Stanley's sake. Dwight manages to get Phyllis' signature by having a fake package delivered to the office meant for her and disguising his apology letter as a proof of delivery paper, which she signs. In Lecture Circuit it is revealed that the fights between her and Angela have caused Michael to reform the Party Planning Committee, putting Dwight and Jim in charge. In New Boss a bitter Phyllis sabotages the new PPC, telling Charles Miner that they spend \\"hours\\" planning parties, leading to Charles dissolving the committee. In \\"Blood Drive\\", Phyllis and Bob invited Jim and Pam to a couples' dinner on Valentine's Day. She and Bob end up having sex in the handicapped restroom, to the extreme discomfort of Jim and Pam when they find out. In \\"Casual Friday,\\" the surprisingly-unkind and heartfelt parts of Phyllis' personality are on display when Michael, Pam and Ryan return to the office in the Michael Scott Paper Company aftermath. Phyllis is cold to Pam because Pam bad-mouthed Dunder Mifflin while making MSPC sales calls, and when Pam is shocked Phyllis hisses \\"Close your mouth, sweetie. You look like a trout.\\" But later, when Phyllis has joined Dwight's protest over Michael's plan to take some clients from the sales staff and give them to Pam and Ryan, Michael's anger towards his past- former-current co-workers is blunted when Phyllis tells him with anguish that he went after them and hurt them in his fight with Corporate. Michael then compromises by giving Pam a sales job, while Ryan returns to temp work. In \\"Cafe Disco\\", Phyllis gets caught in the moment while dancing with Michael and ends up throwing her back out. When Dwight is put in charge of recovering her, she somewhat randomly reveals to him that she has a suspicion that her husband, Bob Vance, is cheating on her with his secretary. She immediately laughs it off, though, saying it sounds silly when said aloud, and it is no longer spoken of in the season.Season 5 Phyllis and Bob both attend Jim and Pam's wedding in Niagara Falls. In \\"Secret Santa\\", Phyllis is delighted and emotional to finally achieve her goal of being Santa Claus at the office's annual Christmas Party, much to Michael's chagrin. In \\"The Manager and the Salesman\\", Phyllis takes allergy medicine, which causes her to defecate in her pants. In \\"New Leads\\", she is very rude to Angela (telling her former adversary that she's too busy to answer Angela's e-mails or walk over to her desk) and Michael (telling him \\"Hand them over, numb nuts\\" when the Sabre- procured top sales leads arrive), and pays the price for her behavior when Michael then gives Phyllis' leads to Angela, and Angela coldly tells Phyllis that she'll only get the leads if she fills out meaningless paperwork for Angela to shred. Later on when Jim is trying to get the sales staff to fix the bad office atmosphere, Phyllis says that the company's changed, non-sales staff who can't deal with it should leave, and they can always outsource that work to India. She does, however, agree to Jim's plan to give some bonus money to the rest of the office in order to restore peace (a plan rendered unnecessary when the staffers think that a plate of cookies IS the peace offering, leading the salespeople to keep the unspoken revenue-sharing plan forever silent). In \\"Happy Hour\\", Phyllis displays a somewhat morbid nature when she reveals to the camera that she likes to go to bars wearing low-cut dresses so that men will hit on her and Bob Vance will then beat them up. This considerably cruel behavior is touched upon again in \\"Whistleblower\\", when Phyllis hides Andy's carry-on bag in the ceiling and coldly tells him \\"You deserve it\\" in retaliation for him being the titular leak on the printer-fires matter. Season 7 In \\"Nepotism\\", Phyllis (along with her co-workers) becomes irritated with the new office assistant Luke, as he neglected to send out packages from the office, and instead kept them in his car. She also participates with Andy in reenacting the spanking scene. In \\"Counseling\\", Dwight hires a day laborer to get rid of a hornet's nest that the office has been complaining about. Phyllis reveals that a hornet stung her up her dress, but Dwight's response is \\"poor hornet\\". Later, she says in an interview that she's glad Michael's getting counseling, because \\"he has a lot of issues and he's stupid\\". In \\"Andy's Play\\", she attends a local production of Sweeney Todd (which Andy is performing in). She tells Michael that she likes how he brought balloons, comparing them to the Pixar movie Up. After the play, she tells Andy he was great. In a deleted scene, when she finds out that her husband Bob is getting along well with Stanley's girlfriend Cynthia, she tells the camera in an interview she was worried that they would not hit it off because Bob has strong moral convictions and Cynthia is a \\"home-wrecking slut\\". In \\"The Sting\\", she suggests that she could seduce rival salesman Danny Cordray, grossing Michael out. In \\"Costume Contest\\", she dresses up as Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. In \\"Viewing Party\\", when Andy gets sick, he later admits his jealousy over Erin Hannon to Phyllis, who decides to help Andy by casually talking to Erin about her relationship with Gabe Lewis. Phyllis attempts this by describing the first time she and her husband Bob had sex. She says that they just stared at each other for hours before finally falling asleep. Erin gets uncomfortable and walks away. In \\"Ultimatum\\", Phyllis's New Year's resolution is she wants to learn yoga with her husband. In \\"The Seminar\\", Phyllis is one of Andy's speakers at his seminar on starting a small business, but she pulls out along with his other speakers Dwight and Stanley. Later, Dwight informs her that he talked to one of the attendees, a man who owns a golf supply business, and that this could actually be a good opportunity for the sales team. Thus she, Dwight and Stanley try to rejoin Andy, who refuses at Darryl's prompting. Phyllis plays a Bride in Michael's movie \\"Threat Level Midnight\\". In \\"Garage Sale\\", Phyllis is at the warehouse garage sale selling some of her mother's old things. Phyllis gives Holly (whose parents are showing early signs of dementia) the advice that if you wait for the day when your parent tells you that they can't take care of themselves, that'll never happen. She then tries to sell Holly a box of bras. Ryan also uses her picture on the labels of his mom's homemade pesto sauce, as she had that \\"mom-look\\" he wanted. In \\"Training Day\\", she is impressed that new office manager Deangelo Vickers has his barber come down to the office to shave him, remarking that it's \\"very cool\\". In \\"Michael's Last Dundies\\", at the Dundies, there is an opening video in which Michael plays various employees around the office, and he plays Phyllis as being an old, enfeebled woman (who even falls and can't get up). Later, after Stanley wins the diabetes award, she tells the camera she has the disease as well, but that she does not \\"make a big deal about it\\". She also participates in serenading the soon-to-depart Michael with an a cappella version of \\"Seasons of Love\\" with altered lyrics. In \\"Goodbye, Michael\\", Phyllis is in the reformed party planning committee (composed of other previous heads Pam and Angela, as well as a problematic Meredith), which is trying to plan a big party involving all of Michael's favorite things for the next day. During the episode, when she is not planning, Phyllis is in the process of knitting Michael a pair a mittens (that can't get wet, cannot be dry cleaned, have to be hand-washed without water, wrung dry gently, and dried with a hair dryer on cool), as his going- away present. Since he is leaving for Colorado later that day instead of tomorrow like he claimed, he pressures her to finish them up (even though her knuckles begin to swell from her arthritis). Later, he takes the mittens even though they're not finished, and sincerely tells her he loves them. In \\"Search Committee\\", she reveals to the camera that she had a child in high school that was put up for adoption. It was thought that this might be Erin, who was born around this time and placed in foster care. Ultimately Phyllis learns that Erin is not her daughter, but after seeing Andy reject Erin, decides to tell her another day.

Biography He was born in the village of Sheper, Upper Zagoria, Albania, then Ottoman Empire, on 27 March 1866. √áajupi's father, Harito Zako, was a tobacco merchant, with a business extending throughout the then-Ottoman Empire and also into Italy and other parts of western Europe. √áajupi's elementary education was undertaken at the nearest Greek elementary school. In 1882, he moved to Alexandria, where he studied French for five years at Sainte Catherine des Lazaristes. During his time in Alexandria, √áajupi met several western European lawyers representing businesses in Egypt. These meetings convinced him to study law in Switzerland, and in 1887, √áajupi arrived in Geneva, where he studied law for five years. While studying law in Switzerland, he met his future wife, Eugenia. The couple had a son, Stefan. After graduating, √áajupi practiced law in Geneva for three years. Eugenia died in 1892, and this tragedy forced √áajupi to leave Switzerland and return to Albania. After his return in 1894, √áajupi found employment representing a German company in Cairo. √áajupi came to spend most of life residing in Egypt. During his Egyptian career, √áajupi defended a French company against the interests of the Egyptian government and the German law firm employing him, a move which caused him to terminate his employment with the firm but ultimately proved fruitless as he lost the case. Due to his family's wealth, however, this did not cause him serious difficulties, and he withdrew to his villa at Heliopolis near Cairo. During this time, √áajupi met many Albanian businesspeople and joined the Albanian nationalist movement in Egypt where he played an active role in agitating for Albanian independence from the Ottoman Empire. Records from 1902 show that he was an active member of the Albanian Fraternity of Egypt, V√´llaz√´ria e Egjiptit. √áajupi's financial support and professional expertise were both required in his role promoting Albanian independence. Following the declaration of Albanian independence, √áajupi organized a party in his home. Literary work Zako on a 1950 stamp of Albania While participating in the Albanian nationalist movement (especially between 1898 and 1912), √áajupi expressed his patriotic beliefs in the form of poetry and prose, with his poetry taking its cue from Tosk Albanian. The nationalist and patriotic messages of his poems made them extremely popular among Albanian adults and children, and led to √áajupi being revered as the most important Albanian poet after Naim Frash√´ri, a position he still holds in the modern state. √áajupi in 1898 also got involved in the Albanian alphabet question and wrote a series of articles in the periodical Albania where he advocated for adoption of a Latin script and objected to a Greek or Ottoman Turkish script for writing Albanian. In 1902, √áajupi published in Cairo an anthology, Baba-Tomorri (\\"Father Tomorr\\"), named after the Albanian mythological character. The volume contains nationalist themes, and it is divided into three sections: \\"Fatherland\\", \\"Love\\", and \\"True and False Tales\\". √áajupi also wrote plays and novels, with his work on Skanderbeg entitled Burr' i dheut (\\"The earthly hero\\") being published in 1907. Additionally, √áajupi wrote a comedy titled Pas vdekjes (\\"After the death\\") in 1910. √áajupi's most popular comedy is the posthumously-published Kat√´rmb√´dhjet√´ vje√ß dh√´nd√´r (\\"A bridegroom at fourteen\\"). The four-act comedy is an attack on the traditional custom of arranged marriages. √áajupi's dramas and comedies are well known in Albania and are frequently performed. The poet died at his home in Heliopolis, Egypt, on 11 July 1930. His remains were transferred to Albania in 1958. Legacy A schoolKFOR Online Homepage at www.nato.int in Kosovo and a high school in Tirana have been named after √áajupi. Also Kor√ß√´ city's theater bears his name. In Literature Agim Shehu, a well known Albanian writer, has recreated in a short story the memory of √áajupi's love for the Swiss young girl Eugenie, who later would become his wife.Bulo, Jorgo (May 2009) √áAJUPI YN√ã.

Early life Tuttle was born in Chariton, Iowa on October 17, 1931 and grew up in Ukiah, California. He described his parents as \\"conservative Iowa farmers, living in California, but they really allowed me to have my own head.\\" At the age of fourteen on a trip to San Francisco, he purchased his first tattoo for $3.50 (equivalent to $ today) of a heart with the word ‚ÄúMother‚Äù after seeing it on the shop wall.

He did work on all seven continents, was tattooed on six continents, and never knowingly tattooed a minor. His fame within the U.S. tattoo world was somewhat controversial, as many tattooists of his day disliked his statements to the press and \\"shameless self-promotion\\". When Tuttle was on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine in October 1970, Sailor Jerry put the picture inside his toilet. Tuttle taught seminars in \\"Tattoo machine maintenance and machine building\\" at tattoo conventions throughout the United States.

She is portrayed by Kate Flannery (Henriette Mantel in the pilot), and is an original character with no equivalent in the British version of the show. Biography Meredith Palmer is the socially inappropriate and sexually promiscuous representative at the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch. In season 2, episode 15; season 8, episode 1; and season 9, episode 23, she is said to have the job of Supplier Relations; however, in the first season, her job was said to be an Accountant. Her computer always displays the solitaire game found in the MS package. Little is known about her early and personal life, but, over the course of the series, some tidbits of information have been revealed. She has been married twice, with one of her ex-husbands leaving her for a woman who works as a garbage collector (who is addressed as \\"Mom\\" by Meredith's children). She has two children, a son named Jake, (of whom she has custody), and a daughter named Wendy (described as \\"The good one\\") who is in the custody of one of Meredith's ex-husbands. In a deleted scene from \\"Garden Party\\", Meredith reveals that she is a former boxer. She is a fan of hard rock music, in particular Led Zeppelin and Mot√∂rhead. Meredith is alleged to be an alcoholic, and it has been alluded to that she often arrives at work with a hangover, as she has complained that people talk too loudly and that the office lights are too bright in the morning. Although she has insisted that she does not have a drinking problem, there are many things she overlooks that are serious signs of addiction, such as keeping a flask under the seat of her mini van, knowing the names of numerous bars around Scranton, and even ingesting hand sanitizer for the alcohol in it. In \\"Stairmageddon\\", she squirts bull tranquilizer from one of Dwight's darts into her coffee. To the disgust of her co-workers, she reveals that she also suffers from pornography addiction. In \\"Local Ad\\", it is heavily implied that she has been cast in pornographic movies, on considerably more than one occasion. On several occasions, it is shown that she is attracted to her co-worker Jim Halpert, which visibly frightens him at times. More than once she has made advances on him, such as asking him to sign her cast for her fractured pelvis (which is located on her crotch; Jim is left visibly shocked after signing the cast). As Jim has no interest in leaving his wife, Pam, for Meredith, she has become hostile towards him; she once egged on a mild argument between Jim and Pam on what they would do if they won the lottery, chanting \\"Get a divorce\\", confided to Robert California that she finds Jim \\"Creepy\\", and provided Jim with an unwanted pamphlet about getting vasectomies as a Christmas present. She was additionally briefly romantically involved with Creed Bratton. Meredith drives a very beat-up Ford Aerostar, which she was once seen nonchalantly crashing into another car, in the episode \\"Women's Appreciation\\". It also appears that Meredith is rather poor; in \\"Frame Toby\\", she reveals that she works a part-time job as a maid, and in \\"Michael's Last Dundies\\", it is shown that she lives in an extremely run-down house. It is also somewhat of a recurring gag that whenever there are any physically injuring consequences that occur due to the nonsense that happens in the office, Meredith is usually the one who suffers. Among other indignities, her hair once caught on fire when it fell onto a candle while she was belly dancing, Dwight almost suffocated her by stuffing her head into a garbage bag while trying to catch a loose bat, she got rabies from the bat, that was one of several wild animals to gnaw on her during a single year, Michael accidentally hit her with his car, Pam once threw a football that hit her in the face, and, while \\"planking\\" on top of a bathroom stall, she was knocked down when Dwight sprayed her with a fire extinguisher. When Toby was teaching self-defense and said \\"Strike, Scream, Run\\", Creed hit Meredith, screamed and ran out of the office. Seasons 1‚Äì2 Meredith technically appeared in the pilot episode of the show. She had no speaking lines and was in the background. Meredith first appears in \\"Diversity Day\\", and has her first speaking appearance in the next episode, \\"Health Care\\", in which it is revealed she had a hysterectomy; Dwight Schrute is somewhat confused as to what this means, believing her to have no vagina. Office Manager Michael Scott forces the entire staff to throw a month-early birthday party for Meredith in \\"The Alliance\\", in hopes of boosting morale and relieving the stress from downsizing rumors. However, it is not much of a success, especially due to Michael mocking her age with an unintentionally offensive joke. In a deleted scene, a joke about her hysterectomy does not go over well, sending her crying into the arms of co-workers.\\"The Alliance\\", Deleted scenes. The Office. Season Two. Region 1 DVD. Prod. Universal Studios; dist. Universal Studios Home Entertainment, 2005. In the second season, Meredith's drinking problem is introduced to the audience, although it appears to be common knowledge to the rest of the staff. Meredith joins Alcoholics Anonymous and attempts to follow through on her New Year's resolutions to quit drinking but does not succeed. She has also made another resolution for 2006 that she would stay away from alcohol \\"during the week.\\" A scene in which a drunk Meredith lifts her top was deleted from \\"E-mail Surveillance,\\" but the writers were so taken with the idea that they incorporated it into her character.Flannery, Kate. (Actor). 2005. \\"Christmas Party\\" [Commentary track], The Office Season One (US/NBC Version) [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: Universal. She exposes her breasts to Michael in the closing moments of \\"Christmas Party\\", and in \\"Booze Cruise\\" she is briefly seen topless, except for a life preserver, after she had been having sex with the captain of the boat. Her son, Jake, is introduced in \\"Take Your Daughter To Work Day\\", where she tells the cameras that it works out perfectly having her son there, because he's suspended from school and this way she doesn't have to hire a babysitter. In \\"Boys and Girls\\", she says that in five years she would like to be five years sober, but quickly changes it to four and a half. In a deleted scene from \\"Casino Night\\" she confesses to not remembering men with whom she has had sex while drunk.The Office - Season 2 In The Injury, Michael and Jim discover that she keeps a bottle of vodka in her van after they catch a concussed Dwight taking a drink of it. Seasons 3‚Äì4 In the season 3 premiere, she is caught eating Angela Martin's alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and her excitement over merger-day champagne was quickly quashed by Michael who says the beverages are for \\"guests only.\\" In the producer's cut of \\"Branch Closing\\", she recalls a past agreement with a coworker to have sex together on the last day of work, but can't remember who she made the deal with. During a deleted scene from \\"Back from Vacation\\", Meredith implies that her tendency to sleep around was worth it because she's \\"seen the world.\\" She joins Pam and Karen's party in \\"A Benihana Christmas\\" because it has alcohol. She declines the margaritas, saying that they are too sweet, and she takes a bottle of vodka. In \\"Ben Franklin\\" she yells \\"Shut up, Angela!\\" when Angela says that a male stripper has no business dancing in the office. In \\"Women's Appreciation\\", she is seen as a careless driver, with one hand controlling the steering wheel, while the other hand is holding a bag of potato chips over her head, pouring its contents directly into her mouth. Afterward, she tosses the empty potato chip bag out the window. When Pam, sitting in the passenger seat, cautions her to not be a litterbug, Meredith replies, \\"My car, my rules.\\" In a later scene at the Steamtown Mall parking lot, she attempts to wedge her minivan into a parking space too small, damaging several cars in the process. In \\"Beach Games\\" she accidentally exposes herself to the camera after forgetting she was not wearing her swimsuit underneath her clothes, also in another deleted scene she orders for the bus to stop because she needs to use the bathroom, even though there are no bathrooms in sight, but instead of going behind a bush she instantly squats right in front of the bus which everyone looks away in disgust (except for Creed). In \\"The Job\\", she describes Jim's haircut as \\"sexy-hot\\" and orders him to turn around so she can see it from all angles. When discussing Jan's breast implants in a talking-head interview, Meredith comments that \\"in my experience, guys are more interested in the back of you than in the front.\\"The Office - Season 3 In \\"Business School\\", she is traumatized when a bat lands on her and Dwight encloses a garbage bag over her head in order to catch it. In the first episode of season four (\\"Fun Run\\"), Michael hits Meredith with his car as he drives into work, cracking her pelvis. The entire staff visits her in the hospital, where tests reveal that she may have rabies, likely on account of the previous season's Bat incident. Michael pesters her to forgive him, and she initially refuses, but later forgives him when she hears about the \\"Rabies Awareness Fun Run\\" he put together in her honor. Upon returning to the office in the third episode of the season, she approaches Jim Halpert and requests that he sign her cast‚Äîwhich is on her crotch‚Äîand tells him in a whisper that she especially appreciated him coming to visit her at the hospital, suggesting that she finds him attractive. Jim signs awkwardly while Creed leers on in the background. During the making of Michael's alternative local Dunder Mifflin ad, Meredith notes that she is not used to making videos \\"with so many people around\\" and she later gives Jim a ride home from work when Pam stays late to work on the ad. In a deleted scene in \\"Goodbye, Toby\\", Meredith is introduced to Holly Flax and seems to like her, until she later interviews that she hates her, and \\"wants to cut her face.\\"The Office - Season 4 Seasons 5‚Äì6 In \\"Business Ethics\\", Meredith reveals she has been sleeping with a supplier in order to gain discounts on products for the company (and Outback Steakhouse gift certificates). Holly Flax thinks she should be fired, while Michael Scott tries to lead her into giving a non-damning statement (though he calls her a \\"stupid bag\\" when she simply restates her unethical behavior). She says she won't quit, but ultimately it turns out Corporate could not care less about her actions and actually seem to find them kind of useful in tough economic times. In deleted scenes, it's revealed Meredith made racist comments that Stanley overheard (though they weren't about him), that she admits she has no skill set to do any kind of useful work, and that she likes working at Dunder Mifflin because she can show up for work at 11AM and leave at 4PM (this last bit of information comes as a shock to Michael). In a deleted scene from \\"Frame Toby\\", it is implied that Michael and Meredith have recently had a one night stand, but Michael rejects her offer to have sex again. In the episode \\"Casual Friday\\", Meredith wears a highly inappropriate dress that barely covers herself. When Toby confronts her and asks her to pull it down more, she pulls it down too far and reveals her entire body above the waist. When her colleagues complain, she pulls it up too far, exposing her lower body. When Kelly asks \\"Meredith, where are your panties?\\" she replies \\"It's casual day!\\" At the office Christmas party in \\"Moroccan Christmas\\", Meredith gets drunk and parties too wildly, accidentally setting her hair on fire while bellydancing. Michael stages an intervention, but the staff are unhelpful in getting her to admit her alcoholism. Michael then pretends to take her out for drinks, but instead takes her to a rehab clinic where he forcibly drags her inside and informs the staff that he's \\"making a deposit\\". When he finds out that she cannot be admitted against her will, he is determined to help her \\"hit rock bottom\\", as he somewhat proudly mentions he was able to do with Jan.The Office - Season 5 In the episode \\"The Promotion\\" it's revealed that Creed and Meredith have had sex. Creed didn't remember this until he makes another pass at her.The Office - Season 6 In the season seven episode \\"PDA\\" Dwight reads an unordered list of people who have had sex in the office which includes Meredith and Creed, meaning that they possibly had sex together in the office. In \\"Koi Pond\\", it is also revealed that she has slept with a terrorist. Season 7 In \\"Nepotism\\", when the terrible new office assistant Luke is using her computer, she tells him to scram and calls him a twerp. Later, when the staff finds out Luke neglected to send out packages from the office, and instead kept them in his car, she breaks into his vehicle. She also tells Michael to \\"Sack up\\", when Luke is using a laser pointer to point at people during a meeting. In \\"Andy's Play\\", Michael swipes a bottle of wine from the concession table, and during the second act, Michael, Meredith, Darryl, and Kevin are seen drinking the wine Michael stole, though Michael intended to have all the wine to himself. In the episode \\"Sex Ed\\", Meredith tells the office that she has Genital Herpes. When Michael, Jim, and Dwight decide to set up a sting operation to see how rival salesman Danny Cordray is stealing all of their clients and observe his sales techniques in \\"The Sting\\", they set up Meredith, as the CEO of Solartech (a fictional company), in Dwight's office (fitted with security cameras), and watch from another room. Danny is then sent in to try to make a sale. All starts well until Meredith attempts to seduce him, forcing Dwight and Jim to send in Oscar and Ryan to save the sting. When Meredith strong-arms both of them, a grossed- out Michael rushes in to call the whole thing off. In \\"Costume Contest\\", Meredith dresses up as Sookie Stackhouse. In \\"Ultimatum\\" it is revealed that Meredith is a smoker and her New Year's Resolution is to only smoke 2 cigarettes per day. In \\"Michael's Last Dundies\\", the first glimpse of Meredith's dilapidated house is shown when Michael and Deangelo arrive to give her a Dundie Award nomination. The door is left ajar and when Michael and Deangelo peek in to see if anybody is home, Meredith walks up the driveway behind them looking disheveled after a night of partying. They decline her offer for breakfast and run away. Later in the episode, Meredith wins the \\"Best Mom\\" Dundie to the shock of the entire office and then kisses Michael when accepting the award. After accepting the award, she gives her acceptance \\"speech\\" proclaiming that she's \\"not going to be a good mom tonight!\\". She later throws her award on the ground in anger when Erin wins the 'Cutest Redhead' Dundie Award instead of her. Season 8‚Äì9 In \\"Spooked\\" Meredith reveals to Robert California that Jim gives her the \\"creeps\\". In Lice, Meredith shaves her head after other office members suspect that she and her family have lice. She wears wigs for the remainder of the series. In \\"Finale\\", the stripper for Angela's bachelorette party turns out to be Meredith's son, Jake. She dances with him and instructs him in more aggressive male stripper moves. During the reunion special Q&A;, when asked if anyone was disappointed in how they were portrayed, Meredith says that it was never shown on camera that she received her Ph.D. in School Psychology during the first seven years and that she chalks up all of her alcohol abuse to her being \\"in college\\" at the time.

It was fought in Pav√≥n, Santa F√© Province, Argentina on 17 September 1861, between the Army of the State of Buenos Aires, commanded by Bartolom√© Mitre, and the Army of Republic of the Argentine Confederation commanded by Justo Jos√© de Urquiza. The withdrawal of Urquiza left the field to Mitre. It led to the dissolution of the national government and the reincorporation of Buenos Aires Province into the Argentine Republic as a dominant member of the nation. Governor Bartolom√© Mitre would act as interim President, ratified by the National Congress, and then as the first President of a unified Argentine Republic. Background =Political postures= During most of the 19th Century, Argentine history was defined by the theoretical, political and military confrontation between two postures: * On one side, the province of Buenos Aires wanted to impose their hegemony over the whole country. * On the other, the remaining provinces wanted to decentralize the nation, giving state autonomy to the provinces. One difference between the porte√±os from Buenos Aires and people from the provinces was that the former did not align directly with the two political parties of the time. Unitarians and Federalists existed both in the capital and in the provinces. Even though they were against each other politically, when it came to defending their own local interests, they joined to confront their common enemy (be it the capital or the provinces, whatever the case may be). Since the secession of Buenos Aires Province on 11 September 1852, on the aftermath of the Battle of Caseros, Argentina was divided between two competing states, the Argentine Confederation and the State of Buenos Aires. The Battle of Cepeda (1859) and the subsequent Pact of San Jos√© de Flores of 1860 set the conditions for Buenos Aires to rejoin the confederation (which came to be called Argentine Republic since the 1860 reform of the Constitution on Buenos Aires request). However, both sides would clash again soon after. =Conflicts in the interior= During president Urquiza's government, the provinces had been at peace, with the notable exception of San Juan Province, where a political crime served as the catalyst for the Battle of Cepeda between Buenos Aires Province and the confederation. This changed when president Santiago Derqui took office. * Several local caudillos, generically unitarians, had been at peace with the government of the Argentine Confederation. When Derqui assumed office, they publicly became part of the opposition. Such were the cases of Manuel Taboada, from Santiago del Estero Province, and Jos√© Mar√≠a del Campo of Tucum√°n Province. * C√≥rdoba's governor Mariano Fragueiro maneuvered poorly in his relations with the opposition. When the situation became violent, President Derqui intervened the provincial government (Derqui was from C√≥rdoba). * The most serious situation developed once again in San Juan Province, where governor Jos√© Antonio Virasoro was deposed and assassinated with the apparent support of some politicians acting in Buenos Aires, among them the future President Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, who was born in San Juan. President Derqui again sent the national army to intervene that province, but the new governor, Antonino Aberastain, attempted to resist the intervention with the local militia. Aberastain was defeated and assassinated, which allowed the Buenos Aires government to accuse President Derqui of having committed a crime. =Elections in Buenos Aires= As a part of the process leading to the reincorporation of the State of Buenos Aires into the Argentine Confederation, established in the Pact of San Jos√© de Flores, after the 1859 Battle of Cepeda, Buenos Aires elected provincial deputies to the National Congress. However, the elections were carried out following the electoral laws of the State of Buenos Aires instead of those of the confederation. The elected deputies were rejected by the National Congress and the Buenos Aires Senators also staged a walkout, in solidarity. President Santiago Derqui issued a decree invalidating the elections in Buenos Aires and established a new date for a rerun. But the Buenos Aires authorities rebelled against the national government and declared the Pact of San Jos√© de Flores null. =Civil war= The National Congress considered this as an act of sedition, so President Derqui named Entre R√≠os's general and former president Justo Jos√© de Urquiza as the commander in chief of the national army with the task of returning the rebel province to the fold. In Buenos Aires, Governor Bartolom√© Mitre took the post of commander in chief of the provincial army. There were several attempts at mediation, from individuals, and foreign governments. All of them failed due to Mitre's and Derqui's intransigence. Urquiza tried, until the last moment, to preserve the peace and declined to take the initiative against the porte√±o army as it was the request of his colonels Ricardo L√≥pez Jord√°n and Prudencio Arnold. President Derqui organized an army in C√≥rdoba, gathering an heterogeneous group of infantry units. These forces were augmented by Urquiza's, with people from Entre R√≠os, Corrientes and Santa F√© provinces, plus some porte√±o defectors; the majority of these forces being cavalry units. In sum, the federalist army had about 17,000 men, where 8,000 came from the center region and 9,000 from Entre R√≠os, Corrientes, Buenos Aires and Santa F√©. Mitre's army was made of 22,000 men and 35 artillery pieces, plus a considerable numeric superiority of arms and artillery and infantry training. The British had supplied the artillery pieces and the trained British artillery crews to operate them. Derqui advanced up to Rosario, where he left the command of the troops in the hands of general Urquiza, while Mitre advanced to the north of Buenos Aires and advanced into Santa F√© province. The battle The armies clashed by the Pav√≥n creek, ( south of the city of Rosario, Santa F√© Province, about northwest of Buenos Aires. Urquiza formed his troops in a defensive position, forming an extended line due east of the Domingo Palacios ranch. On the wings he formed his cavalry. Arriving at from the ranch, Mitre deployed his infantry, preparing for an assault on the enemy's center. But Urquiza's artillery started combat, opening great gaps in the porte√±o infantry, easy targets due to their colorful uniforms. Combat lasted only two hours, during which the federalist left wing under colonel major Juan Sa√°, with the Santa F√© and renegade porte√±o troops of Ricardo L√≥pez Jord√°n, completely vanquished the porte√±o First Cavalry, under general and former Uruguayan president Venancio Flores, chasing them past Arroyo del Medio (a creek forming the border between Buenos Aires and Santa Fe provinces). The porte√±o Second Cavalry, under the command of veteran general Manuel Hornos, offered more resistance; but it had to retreat, leaving behind most of their heavier weapons and supplies plus many prisoners. The right wing, under General Miguel Galarza, steamrolled the small left-wing cavalry of Buenos Aires. The federalist center, instead, composed by untrained militia from the central regions of the country, was forced to retreat by the better trained and equipped porte√±o infantry battalions. Seeing the center's collapse, Urquiza abandoned the field of battle without adding the 4,000 men from Entre R√≠os that he had maintained in reserve, and marched to Rosario, then followed to San Lorenzo and Las Barrancas. At that point he received information of his cavalry's victory but he did not return to the battlefield. Urquiza's unexpected decision left the field open to the porte√±o army, which had retreated to San Nicol√°s de los Arroyos. Mitre decided then to consolidate his position before marching later on Santa Fe. Consequences The battles of Cepeda, Caseros and Pav√≥n were possibly some of the armed conflicts with the most significance in Argentine history, by its institutional consequences, as by the realignment of almost every other political actor after each of the battles. After seeing Urquiza's inaction, Mitre gathered his troops. Part of the federalist cavalry advanced to Pergamino, occupying the town. After a reaction from the porte√±o cavalry, the federalists retreated back to Santa F√©, and Mitre started his advance into that province. Several months had passed from the date of the battle. In the following months, the porte√±o advance was unstoppable. The only federalist army capable of opposing them was Urquiza's, but he did not act and almost dismantled it. Seeing the interior being invaded, Derqui resigned and took refuge in Montevideo. A few weeks later vice-president Juan Esteban Pedernera declared the national government dissolved. Starting on that moment, Mitre projected his influence in the whole country: all the federal governors ‚Äì with the notable exception of Urquiza ‚Äì were deposed in the final weeks of the year and the first few weeks of 1862. Some were deposed by local unitarians, counting on the vicinity of the Buenos Aires army, others directly by the invading porte√±o army. The ones that avoided that fate, came together to accept that the national government was over, and left to Buenos Aires governor Bartolom√© Mitre the task of the national reorganization. Mitre was elected President of the nation by means of new elections -organized by the new provincial governors- from where federalist candidates were forbidden. Porte√±os also took the national government ministries and a good deal of the seats in Congress. The country's capital, which had been relocated to Paran√° by Urquiza, was again moved to Buenos Aires city, so the national government had to accept being a guest of the Buenos Aires city government. The location of the new national capital allowed the porte√±os to defend their interests effectively. In the following years, Argentina maintained a nominal federal organization, but the strength and preponderance of Buenos Aires was unbroken. =Bibliography=  External links * iwgia.org * Batalla de Pav√≥n * The battle * Document catalog Category:Battles involving Argentina Category:Battles of the Argentine Civil War Category:History of Argentina (1852‚Äì1880) Category:Conflicts in 1861 Category:September 1861 events ","title":"Battle of Pav√≥n"},{"id":"8023724","text":"Kelly Rajnigandha KapoorIn \\"Body Language\\", Gabe announces \\"Kelly Rajanigandha Kapoor\\" as the newest member of the Sabre Minority Executive Training Program. is a fictional character from the US television series The Office, portrayed by Mindy Kaling. She is the customer service representative at the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin. Slate magazine called the character one of the reasons to look forward to the return of the show in the fall of 2007. Kaling left the cast and crew after its 8th season to become the creator and star of The Mindy Project, another show produced by Universal Television. She had a guest role in the 9th-season premiere, and the series finale. Overview Kelly Kapoor is a customer service representative at the Scranton branch of fictitious paper distributor Dunder Mifflin. Kelly is the office chatterbox, usually on topics that a teenager might discuss, such as boys, dating, and celebrity gossip. She has said that she wants to get married, and that she cannot wait to \\"get pregnant and have babies.\\" Her closest counterpart in the British series is Donna, although they are not similar in terms of personality. Biography Born in 1980, Kelly is an Indian although she frequently makes incorrect statements about her heritage or religion. Her parents were brought together through an arranged marriage and she has three living sisters, as well as another who died. At the ages of 14 and 15, Kelly spent twenty-one months (April 1995-December 1996) in Berks County Youth Center (a juvenile hall) for stealing her ex-boyfriend's father's boat. She tends to engage in long-winded, one-sided conversations on relatively trivial subjects, often to the chagrin of Toby Flenderson, with whom she shares the annex, situated off the main office. Sometimes, it appears that Kelly plays dumb, as evidenced by a conspiratorial wink to the camera in \\"Boys and Girls\\" and during \\"Trivia\\" when she easily remembers random trivia. She enjoys shopping, especially online, as seen in \\"The Coup\\" and in \\"Dunder Mifflin Infinity\\" and she also loves clothing, as seen in \\"The Coup\\" and \\"Women's Appreciation\\". During the run of The Office, Kelly is often in a severely dysfunctional on-again off-again relationship with fellow worker Ryan Howard. During a long break in their relationship, she dates Darryl Philbin. Kelly leaves her job at Dunder Mifflin at the beginning of the final season of The Office. She becomes engaged to a doctor and excitedly announces her move to Miami‚Äînot realizing she and her fiancee will be moving to Miami, Ohio, not Miami, Florida. She reunites with Ryan Howard in the series finale (set about two years later in the series continuity), and literally runs away from her marriage and family responsibilities in order to resume her relationship with him. Seasons 1‚Äì2 Kelly is portrayed in Season 1 very differently than later in the series. Rather than being loquacious and adolescent, she is just a mild-mannered employee who is just another target of branch Manager Michael Scott's stereotypes. She is first featured in the episode \\"Diversity Day\\", where Michael conducts a diversity training seminar for his employees. When Michael suggests everyone state a race they are sexually attracted to, Dwight immediately responds \\"White and Indian\\", which gets a curious (and rather alarmed) look from her. Kelly leaves to go to a customer meeting and comes back in the middle of a game where everyone in the room has to put a card with a specific race on their forehead (with the race being unknown to themselves), and then must treat everyone as if they were the race on their card. Michael, frustrated that no one is playing properly, attempts to demonstrate how to play, by approaching Kelly as she walks into the room and speaking in a stereotypical Indian accent. He starts to get offensive, mentioning various Indian stereotypes, such as convenience stores and trying to offer her \\"some of my googi googi\\", to which Kelly responds by slapping him and walking away.Season 1 Kelly's race subjects her to embarrassing and insulting references from Michael. For instance, she wins the \\"Spicy Curry\\" award at the 8th Annual Dundie Awards. She angrily questions an evasive Michael about why she got the award. She dresses up as Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz on Halloween, which prompts Michael to say, \\"Interesting take on Dorothy\\" followed by his suggesting that she wear a soccer uniform and dress like Jess Bhamra, a character of Indian descent in Bend It Like Beckham. During the company \\"Christmas Party\\", Kelly gives a possibly inebriated kiss to Dwight, possibly due to his comment in \\"Diversity Day\\", although this plot line did not develop (Dwight was already dating Angela). Instead, Kelly was involved in a wildly uneven relationship with Ryan Howard, the office temp. She hinted (often with little subtlety) that she wanted to marry him and have children as soon as possible, though he was strongly opposed to it and was not especially interested in her. The relationship was often rocky, as Kelly suffocated Ryan with her almost aggressively perky behavior. She tells Jim in \\"The Carpet\\" that she likes Beyonc√©, pink (the color), Pink (the singer), basically anything that is awesome, hot dogs, and snowcones. In the episode \\"Take Your Daughter To Work Day\\", we see Kelly's manipulative side, after she witnessed Stanley's teenage daughter shadowing Ryan. Kelly lies and tells Stanley that Ryan flirted with the teenager, after which Stanley berates Ryan. In the season finale \\"Casino Night\\", Ryan wearily admits to Jim that he is still dating Kelly.Season 2 Seasons 3‚Äì4 At the Hindu Diwali festival, Kelly's parents criticize her choice in Ryan for not being committed to marriage and family and for not making enough money (\\"Diwali\\"); they suggest that she go for a particular, more successful Indian man. When Jim Halpert sees Kelly for the first time after the merger between the Stamford and Scranton branches, he asks her what has been going on in her life, to which Kelly responds by gossiping excitedly about Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes's daughter Suri and Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's daughter Shiloh; when Jim reaffirms his question of what has been going on with her life, she blankly replies that she just told him. She joins Pam and Karen's party in \\"A Benihana Christmas\\" with Ryan. Hurt by Ryan's comments in \\"Business School\\", Michael moves Ryan's desk next to Kelly's as a form of punishment. Kelly is excited by the move, though she and Ryan bicker (and passionately make up) frequently. In \\"The Negotiation\\", Kelly reveals that Ryan once laughed at her during a date when a boy on a Ferris wheel spilled his milkshake on her. Ryan just replies \\"Well, that was funny; that's why.\\" She also questions Ryan's bravery, mentioning that he once called her for help when he thought there was a \\"murderer\\" in his apartment. All this bickering makes Toby wonder in a talking head interview if Michael purposely put Ryan and Kelly together next to him just to punish him. Toby comments, \\"If he did...genius.\\" Despite her often frivolous and immature behavior, Kelly is seen in a rare professional capacity in \\"Product Recall.\\" She trains Oscar, Angela, and Kevin for taking customer service phone calls after an obscene watermark is printed on Dunder Mifflin paper, prompting too many complaint calls for Kelly alone to answer. She is very enthusiastic about this new task, and mentions that sometimes when she is bored she will make up a name for herself or talk in an accent (such as imitating Bridget Jones) while on the phone. Unlike Angela, who cannot bring herself to follow Kelly's advice and say \\"I'm sorry\\" to irate customers, Kelly demonstrates notable skill at soothing the angry callers. In \\"The Job\\", Ryan abruptly ends his relationship with Kelly after receiving a promotion to the corporate headquarters. According to a short NBC advertisement that aired after the season, Kelly spent much of the summer crying, and her days in the office were spent under her desk not speaking or associating with anyone.Season 3 Kelly spends most of season four getting over her breakup with Ryan and beginning a new relationship with Darryl Philbin. In \\"Dunder Mifflin Infinity\\", Kelly attempts to reunite with Ryan by telling him she is pregnant with his child. Kelly is overjoyed when Ryan agrees to have dinner with her, but the plan backfires when he learns that she is not actually pregnant. When he confronts her about it, she does not understand why the lie would upset him and is surprised and upset when he refuses to date her again. Ryan later asks Corporate to have her job outsourced to India. A relationship sparks with warehouse foreman Darryl, after he protects Kelly from Dwight's anger over her purchasing paper online while he was trying to beat the website in sales. She delightedly confesses that she did not really need paper; she just loves the cute and friendly seeming website because she gets to hear the sound effect and the text that says \\"Thanks for shopping with Dunder Mifflin!\\" In the episode \\"Money\\", Kelly and Darryl kiss in the conference room in front of Ryan, confirming their relationship. Kelly does not seem to have forgiven Ryan, however, during a grammar discussion of objective and subjective case, Kelly complains that Ryan used her \\"as an object.\\" Darryl seems at times much less enthusiastic about the relationship, evoking Ryan's previous attitude toward Kelly. He declines to go on a date with her in favor of spending time with his daughter, and when Kelly presents him with an ultimatum (her or his daughter), he does not change his mind. However, he complains in a talking head interview that Kelly primarily seems interested in him when Ryan is around. He also gives her some rare straight talk, showing that he can view their relationship in a mature way. A bemused Kelly tells the cameras, \\"Darryl Philbin is the most complicated man that I have ever met. I mean who says exactly what they're thinking? What kind of game is that?\\" In the episodes \\"Local Ad\\" and \\"The Deposition\\", it becomes clearer that Kelly and Darryl are dating. In the latter episode, Kelly becomes confrontational and insulting towards Pam when Darryl keeps beating Jim at ping-pong. Pam finally gets fed up and challenges Kelly to a game. However, it becomes clear immediately that Kelly and Pam are evenly matched at ping-pong, as they both are abysmal. In \\"Goodbye, Toby\\", Kelly shows that she still bears a grudge against Ryan, who has been arrested on charges of fraud. She describes in detail how she looks forward to visiting Ryan in prison, where the other inmates would be sure to check her out and tell Ryan that they wish they had an ex-girlfriend as hot as her.Season 4 Seasons 5‚Äì6 In season five, Ryan seems to have a renewed interest in Kelly. However, she is still dating Darryl. In \\"Customer Survey\\", she changes Jim and Dwight's customer survey scores to poor ones because they did not attend her America's Got Talent wrap party. They explain this to Michael, however he lets her off the hook because he often had trouble getting people to come to his parties as well. She pretends to start crying so that people will think Michael is angry with her, but they both end up laughing. In \\"Business Trip\\", Ryan moves back to the annex with Kelly in preparation for Pam's return. Kelly says she has no intention of getting back together with Ryan given the way he treated her, but the two are later seen passionately kissing. Ryan helps Kelly send a message to Darryl saying their relationship is over, and Darryl responds saying \\"it's cool.\\" Kelly is overjoyed while Ryan is shocked and Darryl happily walks to his truck. Kelly and Ryan confirm that they are dating again. In the next episode, Ryan allegedly takes a trip to Thailand so they break up again. A confused Kelly agrees to give him money and have sex with him one more time before he goes. Later, in \\"The Duel\\", after Angela remarks of her delight that two men are fighting over her, Kelly responds, \\"I guess people have fewer choices as they get older.\\" In \\"Lecture Circuit Part 1\\" Dwight finds out from her personal record that she was in juvenile hall for almost two years, the reason being that she stole her boyfriend's dad's boat after he broke up with her. In \\"Blood Drive\\", when she notices how upset Michael is, she sits with him, until it is closing time. When Michael quits his job, Kelly shows interest in her new boss, Charles, as does Angela. Kelly quickly befriends the new receptionist, Erin.Season 5 As of the beginning of season six, she is once again dating Ryan. Season 7 In the season 7 premiere \\"Nepotism\\", Kelly is encouraged by Dwight to attend the minority executive training program from Yale. Dwight originally encouraged her in hopes to become her svengali but later regrets his decision. In \\"Counseling\\", Kelly is the one who comes up with the idea that Dwight should Pretty Woman the Steamtown Mall store that denied him service, but when Jim says that it is a good idea, she does not remember what she said. In a talking-head interview, she admits to the camera that she knows she talks a lot, so she's learned to tune herself out. In \\"Sex Ed\\", she considers Meredith \\"gross\\" for having genital herpes. In a deleted scene, she asks Jim to open up a jar of Fluff for her. While Jim is having trouble opening it, Kelly rambles about how she's not sure if Ryan is capable of true love, because he told her if he was stuck in heaven and she was stuck in hell, he would not live with her in hell. When Jim is unable to open the jar, he hands it back to her, to which she responds with \\"you're just gonna hand it back to me?\\" In the beginning of \\"The Sting\\", when Oscar rides into the office on his bicycle that is the same model as Lance Armstrong's, Kelly says she feels awkward because she is on Sheryl Crow's side (referring to their breakup). Later, when Michael announces to the office that extremely attractive salesman Danny Cordray has been hired as their new traveling salesman, Kelly stares at him and mumbles \\"F**k me.\\" In \\"The Search\\", during the cold open, Ryan and Kelly announced to the office that they were getting a divorce, having married over a week earlier on the spur of the moment. They said the break-up was mutual, but after getting little reaction to their news, Ryan declared that the split was not amicable. After the divorce Ryan and Kelly continued to date. Season 8‚Äì9 In Season 8, wanting to get Kelly away from Ryan, Pam sets her up with Cece's pediatrician, Ravi. When Ryan forces her to choose between the two, she chooses Ravi. At the beginning of Season 9, it was revealed that Kelly and Ravi got engaged and moved to Oxford, Ohio, which is home to Miami University. Kelly happily quit her job at Dunder-Mifflin, mistakenly believing she was moving to Miami, Florida, with Ravi. Ryan then also moves to Ohio, claiming it's for unrelated reasons. In \\"Finale\\", it is revealed that Kelly is married to Ravi. Ryan has a baby named Drake with his ex-girlfriend, who walked out on them leaving Ryan as a single parent. At Dwight and Angela's wedding reception, Ryan induces a mild allergic reaction in his baby so that Ravi will have to examine him, using that as an excuse to get Kelly alone and tell her that he wants her back. Kelly and Ryan run off together, abandoning Drake, who Nellie then offers to adopt.

The Mill was built to drain the nearby Long Gore Marsh (located to the south of the mill) along with the Brograve Levels as a helper mill for its much older neighbour Brograve Mill. Both this mill and Brograve Mill drained the levels into the Waxham New Cut via the same drainage channel. The name of the mill is also somewhat disputed, as the current Ordnance Survey Explorer map states the name of the mill as Lambrigg Mill. The name Lambridge, however, corresponds with the name of the nearby Lambridge Mill Farm and Lambridge Mill Cottage. The mill still stands today in a derelict state with only two of the original four stocks remaining, these being precariously perched on top of the brickwork attached to the exposed iron windshaft. Only a small rotten section of the original cap remains.

During World War II from 1941 to 1945, he attended school in Amarillo, Texas; Topeka, Kansas and Sioux City, Iowa. From 1945 to 1947, he attended high school in Springfield, Missouri, graduating in 1947. He received his B.S. from Southwest Missouri State (now Missouri State University) in 1951.

Hancock was the originator, catalyst, and primary organizer and author of an omnibus state and local tax limitation amendment to the Missouri Constitution passed by the voters of Missouri in 1980. Placed on the ballot by an initiative petition process led by Hancock, what is commonly referred to as \\"The Hancock Amendment\\", consisted of new sections 16 to 24 of Article 10 of the Missouri Constitution. In general, subject to certain definitions, exceptions and enforcement processes outlined in the Hancock Amendment, the Hancock Amendment limited total state revenues and expenses in Missouri to a percentage of personal income of persons in Missouri, required the state of Missouri to continue to fund expenditures of local political subdivisions required by state law, and required new local tax, licenses or fees to be approved by the voters of such political subdivisions. The Hancock Amendment was one of the first state tax limitation amendments in the United States and is still in effect today. Advocating Constitutional Tax and Spending Amendment he was a candidate for the Republican nomination for United States Senator in 1982, challenging incumbent Republican John Danforth, and a candidate for nomination as Lieutenant Governor of Missouri in 1984, losing out to Democrat Harriet Woods.

Gai-Luron is a French comics series about a melancholic basset hound, Gai-Luron, created on July 12, 1964 by Gotlib.Gai-Luron ou la joie de vivre, n¬∞1, p1. Footnote of date of creation by Gotlib Originally published in the Franco-Belgian comics magazines Vaillant and Pif Gadget, the character joined Nanar, Jujube et Piette, which Gotlib had drawn since 1962, but eventually headlined a hit series of its own. The album collection series started in 1975, and the second album, Gai-Luron en √©crase m√©chamment was awarded the prize for French comical work at the Angoul√™me in 1976. Synopsis It follows the anthropomorphic dog Gai-Luron (whose name can be roughly translated as \\"Jolly Fellow\\", which contrasts with Gai-Luron's generally apathetic behaviour), his girlfriend Belle-Lurette and his friend Jujube the fox. The plot sometimes involves Gai-Luron and Jujube reading their fan mail, which is almost always written by the same reader, a little boy named Jean-Pierre Li√©geois, or else a friend or relative of his.

Brief biography  Simon Soloveychik was born in a Jewish family. His father, Lev I. Soloveychik, was editor, writer and administrator at the Krasnaya Zvezda (\\"Red Star\\") newspaper, and later managed the Moscow-based Voienizdat publishing house. After graduating from the Philology Department of Moscow State University in 1953 Simon worked as a boys and girls scouts leader, a secondary school teacher, and a correspondent of Pioneer magazine. In 1960 he worked for the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, where he launched a wide theme named \\"Aly parus\\" (Scarlet Sail), where he published articles on humanism and morality. In mid-1980 he initiated a new scientific-practical pedagogical movement - pedagogy of cooperation. From that perspective upbringing of a child was considered not as an influence upon a child but as a dialog between educator and a student. He also regularly published pedagogical articles in the Novoe vremya (New Time) magazine. In 1992 Soloveychik founded and lead the newspaper Pervoe sentyabrya (First of September), which promoted humanistic pedagogical ideas. In 1994 Simon Soloveychik wrote the manifest \\"Chelovek Svobodny\\" (\\"Free Man\\"), in which he briefly and clearly wrote the basic philosophical ideas of upbringing of a free man, and he gave definitions of such concepts as internal freedom and conscience, explained what a free child is, what a free school is, and what the way to raising free men is.  Parenting For Everyone  The main work of his life is his book Pedagogika dlya vseh (Parenting For Everyone) (1977-1986), where he shared his philosophical insights on the goals, means and conditions of parenting free children; he explained how to raise the heart, intelligence and spirit of a free man, and underlined the faults of conventional approaches to parenting. According to Soloveychik, parenting is the science about the art of upbringing children. The main idea in upbringing is that parents by all means should increase a child's dignity. > \\"Soloveychik was a classic member of the Russian intelligentsia, focused on > underlying ideas and their significance, rather than on what was practical > or expedient.

He spent most of his career in the lower U.S. and German divisions. However, he did spend one season in Major League Soccer with the New England Revolution. He also earned three caps with the U.S. national team in 1993. Collegiate career Peter Woodring played college soccer at Berkeley, better known as \\"Cal\\", from 1986 to 1990. In 1987 and 1990, he was selected to the All Far West teams, and was the team's MVP in 1987, 1989 and 1990. He holds Cal's season record for most assists with 12 and is the school's fourth highest scorer with 22 goals. He received his B.A. in International Business. In 1989, during the college soccer off-season, Woodring played a single season with the San Francisco Bay Blackhawks of the Western Soccer League (WSL). The Blackhawks, along with several other teams in the WSL were essentially semi- pro teams and many top west coast college players played in the league when not playing NCAA soccer. Years in Europe When he graduated, the WSL had merged with the east-coast based American Soccer League to form the American Professional Soccer League (APSL). After briefly flourishing in 1990, by 1991 the APSL had less than half the teams remaining from the 1990 season. When one of his college team mates suggested that Woodring pursue a professional career in stable European leagues rather than in the United States he left for Germany for a fall 1991 trial with SV Wiesbaden of the German third division. Woodring played through the 1991‚Äì92 season with Wiesbaden, where scouts from first division team Hamburger SV noticed him. In 1992, Woodring signed with Hamburger SV. However, he had difficulty finding regular playing time with the first team, seeing time in only six matches in 1992‚Äì93 and a few more at the start of the 1993‚Äì94 season. However, he played most of his games with Hamburger SV's amateur reserve team. With the possibility of finding regular playing time appearing low, Woodring moved to Danish club Aalborg BK for the last half of the 1993‚Äì94 season and the first half of the 1994‚Äì95 season. His performances helped propel the club into first place of the Danish Superliga championship, but Woodring left the club halfway through the season, before Aalborg BK eventually won the 1994‚Äì95 Danish Superliga title. He returned to Germany to again play third division football, this time with SV Wehen. He would play 11 games with the team through the end of the 1994‚Äì95 season. Return to the United States In 1995, Woodring returned to the United States. He played with the Hawaii Tsunami of the USISL. The New England Revolution selected Woodring in the second round of the inaugural MLS draft (15th overall). He played 21 games, scoring 1 goal, in the 1996 season. On March 10, 1997 The Revs released Woodring during the 1997 preseason, despite his having scored a goal in an exhibition game three days before. After leaving the Revs, Woodring moved to Marin, California to become a financial analyst. While there, he became an assistant coach on the Berkeley men's soccer team starting in September 1998. He also briefly played with the Chico Rooks of the United Soccer League. In 2000, he scored four goals for the Olympic Club of the San Francisco Soccer Football League's Major Division. In 2003, he played for the Marin Soccer League's Bolinas Team. National team Based on initial success with Hamburger SV, Woodring was called up for three games for the US national team in 1993. One game came as a substitute, at the 69th minute in the 1993 U.S. Cup loss to Brazil. Post-soccer career Woodring is currently the Senior Vice President and Portfolio Manager at Cephus Capital Management. Before that, he was a Vice President of research and trading at US Trust Company.

It was created in 1997 on the recommendation of the Stanford University President's Commission on Technology in Teaching and Learning. Professors Larry Leifer and Larry Friedlander lead a staff of researchers, technologists, educators, and teaching and learning specialists who worked with Stanford faculty to enhance learning by students in their courses. The Stanford Learning Lab completed its work in the spring of 2002 and was followed by The Stanford Center for Innovations in Learning (SCIL), which inherited core capabilities in technology development, educational program evaluation, and learning design and continued to perform research in these areas. Projects  * Human Biology Project: A multi-year collaboration with faculty in Stanford's Human Biology program to enhance teaching and learning in large lecture courses developing online problem sets (that evolved into the CourseWork Course Management System) and online policy challenges in which students debated policy issues. * The Word and the World, A Large Lecture Intro to Humanities Course: In this multi-year project to create learning communities in a large lecture classes, a course web site presented (a)rich resources supporting the online course texts to engage students; (b) on-line assignments that structured the learners‚Äô reading activities; and (c) an on-line asynchronous discussion system, Panfora, that allowed students to express their ideas, provide peer critique, and include the lecturing faculty in discussion. It had special features to support large lecture courses such as photographs of the posting student next to his/her message, organization into sections, and notification systems to alert faculty and groups to special postings. * Courselets: An integrated set of instructional activities that covers a small set of extracurricular concepts. * Cross-Disciplinary Learning: An investigation of issues that arise when an expert in one discipline needs deep knowledge from another discipline * Global Learning Teams: A set of studies that focus on the design, development, and testing of best practices, principles, and tools to support globally distributed cross-cultural learning teams. * I-RITE: Integrating Research Into the Teaching Environment : A program that integrates research and teaching by having Ph.D. students describe their research in brief, compelling statements understandable to novices in the field. * Learning Careers: Hewlett General Education in Research Universities: An exploration of individual learning patterns using portfolios * Mobile Learning: An exploration of mobile technologies and fundamental human cognitive challenges involved in learning on-the-go. * Tomorrow's Professor SM Listserv: Twice weekly postings on academic life, preparing for the professorate, and new approaches to teaching, learning, and research. * Wallenberg Hall Design: An innovative learning space and the future home of the Learning Lab. * CSCL (Computer Supported Collaborative Learning) 1999: The third international conference devoted to the exploration of the roles for technology in collaborative forms of learning and teaching, was sponsored by the Learning Lab and held on Stanford campus, December 12‚Äì15, 1999. * IE264: Global Project Coordination: A multi-site course to help students learn how to work effectively in cross-cultural, distributed teams. * Integration of Asynchronous Discussion in IHUM courses: An expanded study of asynchronous online discussion in lecture courses. * Learning by Design with BMW: A study of a highly successful globally distributed product development team that knows how to leverage networks of experts, coaches, communication technologies, and the value of fun. * ME110K (Kyoto), Spring 1998: An Overseas Studies course, designed to give students cultural and interpersonal knowledge in addition to technical knowledge. * New Century Scholars Workshop: A series of one-week summer workshops designed to help beginning engineering professors from across the United States, understand learning and teaching practices which support effective learning for all students. * OSP (Overseas Studies Program) Winter 1999 course: An exploration of interdisciplinary, internationally distributed scholarly communities. Research results  * Large lecture classes can be made personal and satisfying. Evaluations show that students who spend more time in groups and in project work learn better. Faculty members report a better grasp on students' needs and progress. They also benefit from a wider set of resources and tools at their disposal. * Attempting too many innovations in a single course is expensive and overwhelming. The Learning Lab's successes were more assured when it focused on specific aspects of a course and incrementally acquired strategies and tools that could be applied more manageably in future courses. * Dissemination can be hampered by the lack of a coordinated delivery system. As the Learning Lab's knowledge of pedagogy expanded and new software products, services, and space innovations were developed, it became difficult to use existing delivery systems to inform the campus of Lab experiments. Part of the problem is structural. Because the Lab is not linked administratively to other units on campus, the Lab has found it difficult to integrate itself in existing cross- campus relationships. * Innovations must link firmly with departments and initiatives. * Social engagement and informal contact are essential between participants in collaborative and distributed learning environments.

A subdistrict of the Lakeview District Area, its boundaries as defined by the City Planning Commission are: Lake Pontchartrain to the north, the New Basin Canal and Pontchartrain Boulevard to the east, Veterans Boulevard to the south, and the 17th Street Canal to the west. The area was largely built on land reclaimed from Lake Pontchartrain. It is a commercial seafood and recreational boating hub for the city and has been known for its seafood restaurants. In recent years, the area has seen large condominium-complex developments built which overlook the Lake, marinas, and centrally located West End Park. The majority of the land and marinas at West End are managed by the New Orleans Municipal Yacht Harbor Management Corporation, a public-benefit corporation of the City of New Orleans, with much of it leased to private interests and individuals. The area is immediately north of the site of the levee failure on the 17th Street Canal during Hurricane Katrina, which was a primary cause of the inundation and devastation of many neighborhoods in New Orleans. Located outside of the flood walls, West End experienced some severe damage, but it was limited to heavy winds and high water destroying the restaurants and music clubs built on piers over the lake. Because West End was developed above sea level, the neighborhood only flooded due to the storm surge coming in from Lake Pontchartrain. After the water rapidly receded, the location became a staging area for the US Coast Guard, the Louisiana National Guard, and the Massachusetts National Guard, who were conducting rescues of stranded residents. Two yacht club facilities, the New Orleans Yacht Club and Southern Yacht Club, along with a number of marine-related businesses, condominiums, and boathouses, occupy the area surrounding the park, marinas, and boat channels. West End's most recognizable icon, the New Canal Lighthouse or more commonly New Basin Canal Lighthouse, originally constructed in 1838, was heavily damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Reconstruction of the familiar landmark began in February 2012 and was completed in 2013. Geography West End is located at and has an elevation of . According to the United States Census Bureau, the district has a total area of . of which is land and (87.59%) of which is water. =Adjacent neighborhoods= * West End (north) * Lakeview (east) * Navarre (east) * Mid-City (east) * Dixon (south) * Hollygrove (south) * Jefferson Parish (west) =Boundaries= West End is the westernmost point of the lakefront in Orleans Parish, with Jefferson Parish and Bucktown on the other side of the 17th Street Canal. The City Planning Commission defines the boundaries of West End as these streets: Lake Pontchartrain, the New Basin Canal, Pontchartrain Boulevard, Veterans Memorial Boulevard and the 17th Street Canal. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 4,724 people, 2,462 households, and 1,169 families residing in the neighborhood. The population density was 6,749 /mi¬≤ (2,624 /km¬≤). As of the census of 2010, there were 3,147 people, 1,551 households, and 684 families residing in the neighborhood. History West End was originally a nationally renowned resort built between 1835 and 1876 and named New Lake End. In 1878, the name was changed to West End with the additions of a hotel, restaurant, and an amusement park built on piers over Lake Pontchartrain. (In the 20th century, the amusement park was moved to a newer stretch of reclaimed land and became part of a large, privately owned complex called Pontchartrain Beach.) The oldest point-to-point sailing regatta in the Western Hemisphere, the Race to the Coast was formed on July 4, 1850 by Southern Yacht Club and took their start at Dan Hickock's Lake Hotel at West End before transiting the Rigolets Pass through the marsh leading into Lake Borgne and finishing at a pier near the Montgomery Hotel along the Mississippi Sound in Pass Christian, Mississippi. The regatta continues today with a start on Lake Pontchartrain and finishes in Gulfport, Mississippi at the Gulfport Yacht Club. In the late 19th century, the City of New Orleans constructed a harbor and railroad and streetcar facilities along the New Basin Canal and the 17th Street Canal. By 1921, it had built a seawall out into the Lake and filled in this space to create the large and oak-lined West End Park. West End was a popular music venue in the early days of jazz. Joe \\"King\\" Oliver wrote the tune West End Blues in commemoration of the area; a recording of the number by Louis Armstrong is one of the most famous jazz recordings of the 1920s. West End has also appeared on the pages of works by notable authors including Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi and Kate Chopin's novel The Awakening (Chopin novel) The area grew to become well known for outstanding and historic seafood restaurants, including Brunings which opened in 1859 and operated nearly continuously. Damage from Hurricane Georges prompted a move to a nearby building somewhat better sheltered from storm surge, but it was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005.

The Hamilton Tiger- Cats defeated the Winnipeg Blue Bombers 32‚Äì7 at Varsity Stadium in Toronto. This was the first Grey Cup game to be covered on coast-to-coast television. The game is famous for a play in which Hamilton defensive back Ray Bawel intercepted a Winnipeg pass and raced unopposed for an apparent touchdown. As he passed the Winnipeg bench, however, Dave Humphrey, a Toronto fan who was standing on the sidelines in front of the Winnipeg bench, put his foot out and tripped Bawel. After the officials huddled together for a while to discuss the situation not covered by the rulebook, referee Paul Dojack assessed a penalty of half the distance to the goal line as a sort of compromise.

He lent his translation skills to help negotiate the first land purchases from Maori in New Plymouth and Wellington and became a key figure in the establishment of the settlement of New Plymouth. He was described by Edward Jerningham Wakefield, son of New Zealand Company founder Edward Gibbon Wakefield, as short, stout and \\"perfectly round all over\\" and fond of relating \\"wild adventures and hairbreadth 'scapes\\".Edward Jerningham Wakefield, \\"Adventures in New Zealand\\", Vol 1, 1845. Sailor, trader and whaler Barrett was born and raised in the slums of either Durham or Bermondsey, England He spent six years as a sailor and arrived in Taranaki from Sydney as a mate on the trading vessel Adventure in March, 1828. He and captain John Agar \\"Jacky\\" Love established a trading post at Ngamotu (site of modern-day New Plymouth), trading muskets and trinkets for flax, maize, wheat and vegetables grown by local Te Atiawa MƒÅori. The trading post attracted increasing numbers of passing ships. Barrett picked up a rudimentary understanding of the MƒÅori language, was given the name of Tiki Parete and married Rawinia, the daughter of a local chief. In 1832 Barrett and his former crewmates (recalled as Akerau, probably Akers, Tamiriri, probably Wright, Kopiri probably Phillips, and Oliver in 1873)History of Taranaki: B Wells 1878 joined local Maori in the Otaka pƒÅ at Ngamotu (Moturoa) to aid their defence in the face of an attack by heavily armed Waikato MƒÅori, firing on the invaders with three cannon, using nails, iron scraps and stones for ammunition. The siege lasted more than three weeks before the Waikato withdrew, leaving a battle scene strewn with bodies, many of which had been cannibalised. In June Barrett and Love migrated south with as many as 3000 Atiawa MƒÅori. In late 1833 or early 1834 Barrett and Love established a whaling station at Queen Charlotte Sound. Negotiator In September 1839 Barrett sailed from Queen Charlotte Sound to Port Nicholson aboard the Tory with representatives of the New Zealand Company to help negotiate the purchase of land there. The party remained there for about 10 days, ultimately securing the signatures of 16 Maori on a deed (written in English) for the purchase of an estimated 64,000ha in the Wellington area. The Waitangi Tribunal noted in its 2003 report on the Port Nicholson land purchases that Barrett - who it describes as having \\"marked incompetence as an interpreter\\" - was unable to translate the deed into Maori and \\"quite incapable of conveying its meaning ... to the assembled Maori\\". Barrett was later described by a contemporary as speaking \\"whaler Maori, a jargon that bears much the same relation to the real language of the Maori as the pigeon English of the Chinese does to our mother tongue\\".Protector of Aborigines George Clark in \\"Notes on Early Life in New Zealand\\", cited by Waitangi Tribunal Report on the Wellington District, page 52. In November 1839 Barrett arrived in Taranaki on the Tory to negotiate the purchase of land from his wife's iwi, remaining there while Wakefield continued north to Kaipara. On February 15, 1840 he translated Deeds of Sale and obtained 72 signatures to formalise the purchase of a vast area of Taranaki, extending from Mokau to Cape Egmont and inland to the upper reaches of the Whanganui River. Payment was made with guns, blankets and other chattels. J. Houston, writing in Maori Life in Old Taranaki (1965), observed: \\"Many of the true owners were absent, while others had not returned from slavery to the Waikatos [sic] in the north. Thus the 72 chiefs of Ngamotu cheerfully sold lands in which they themselves had no interest, as well as lands wherein they held only a part interest along with several others.\\"\\"Maori Life in Old Taranaki\\" by J. Houston (1965) as cited by J.S. Tullett, \\"The Industrious Heart: A History of New Plymouth\\" (1981), page 8 The Maori were not aided in their understanding of the deal by Barrett's translation skills. In the Land Commission hearings at Wellington in 1843, when asked to translate a lengthy land sale deed into Maori to demonstrate his abilities, he \\"turned a 1600-word document, written in English, into 115 meaningless Maori ones\\".Puke Ariki museum essay. Mediator and settler Dicky Barrett's grave in Lower Bayly Rd, Ngamotu, New Plymouth.Barrett moved to Wellington to open a hotel and in early 1840 was appointed Agent for the Natives by Wakefield, who said the role \\"will make him the medium between the settlers and their dark neighbours in all disputes and in the allotment of the native reserves in lieu of the land now occupied and cultivated by them\\". The position was rewarded with a ¬£100 a year salary and Barrett received glowing praise from Wakefield for his loyalty and success as well as his interpreting skills. In 1841 he returned to New Plymouth with Frederic Alonzo Carrington, a surveyor commissioned by the New Zealand Company, who began surveying the planned town. He married Rawinia the same year, describing himself on the marriage certificate as \\"a whaling master of full age\\". Barrett remained in New Plymouth as the settlement grew, establishing a commercially unsuccessful whaling station and serving as an unofficial harbour master, helping immigrants ashore as ships arrived. He also became a gardener and farmer. He drove the first cattle and sheep to Taranaki from Wellington and introduced a wide variety of new crops and vegetables. He missed the landing of the first settlers, who arrived on the William Bryan in March 1841, because he was about 10 km inland, searching for peach trees he had earlier planted. When the Land Claims Commission held hearings in New Plymouth into disputed land purchases in 1844, it awarded the New Zealand Company 24,000ha of \\"legitimately purchased\\" land, including 72ha for Barrett and his family. Fall from favour From 1842 Barrett became a persona non grata and was ostracised after being blamed by Atiawa MƒÅori and settlers alike - as well as Governor Robert FitzRoy - for contributing to tension over settlement of MƒÅori land with his initial negotiations. The tension later spilled over into war. Barrett died in 1847, possibly as the result of a heart attack. Claims that he suffered fatal injuries while killing a whale off the coast of New Plymouth, reported by the Taranaki Herald in 1941, are not supported by any contemporary evidence. He was buried at Wahitapu Cemetery off lower Bayly Rd, New Plymouth. A headstone shows he is buried with his wife and eight-year-old daughter. His legacy remains in New Plymouth with Barrett Lagoon, Barrett Reef, Barrett Domain, Barrett Road and Barrett Street, location of the former Barrett Street Hospital. Barrett Reef, in Wellington Harbour, was also named after him. For more information, see New Plymouth. References External links * Puke Ariki museum resources on Dicky Barrett * Julie Bremner.

The term is closely related to but distinguishable from context- sensitive design in that it asserts that all decisions in transportation planning, project development, operations, and maintenance should be responsive to the context in which these activities occur, not simply the design process. CSS seeks to balance the need to move vehicles efficiently and safely with other desirable outcomes, including historic preservation, environmental sustainability, and the creation of vital public spaces. In transit projects, CSS generally refers to context sensitive planning, design, and development around transit stations, also known as transit-oriented development. Overview Custom-designed fittings are one aspect of CSS. Here, the ammonite design of the lamnp standards reflects the local geology of Lyme Regis. In contrast to long-standing practices in transportation design that place primary importance on moving traffic (vehicular throughput), the CSS process emphasizes that transportation facilities should fit their physical settings and preserve scenic, aesthetic, historic and environmental resources, while maintaining safety and mobility. For instance, if a state highway that passes through a downtown main street, applying CSS principles would entail creating a street where the movement of vehicles does not impede pedestrian activity and sidewalk commerce, rather than a street that is simply widened and straightened to increase speed, capacity and mobility for vehicles as a singular transportation objective. CSS therefore includes principles for context-sensitive decision-making that place a high value on community input and consensus, and more technical principles of context sensitive design. When CSS principles are applied to transportation projects, the process involves a much broader range of disciplines than traditional transportation design methods, which rely exclusively on the judgment of traffic engineers. CSS is a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach that involves everyone with a significant stake in the project, such as the residents, businesses and local institutions that will be affected by an intervention or a failure to address the transportation implications of development such as congestion. Rather than approaching these stakeholders at the tail end of the design process in an attempt to gain approval, CSS emphasizes the need to incorporate their feedback from the very outset of the planning and design development processes and during all subsequent stages of construction, operations and maintenance. Qualities of a CSS project The following list of qualities (developed at a 1998 conference for transportation planners called \\"Thinking Beyond the Pavement\\"http://www.contextsensitivesolutions.org/content/reading/tbtp- conference/resources/tbtp-conference/) describe the core goals of the CSS process. The CSS process This outline of the core steps in the CSS process was also developed at the \\"Thinking Beyond the Pavement\\" conference. History The initial guiding principles of CSS came out of the 1998 \\"Thinking Beyond the Pavement\\" conference as a means to describe and foster transportation projects that preserve and enhance the natural and built environments along with economic and social assets for neighborhoods they pass through. In 2003, the Federal Highway Administration announced that under one of its three Vital Few Objectives (Environmental Stewardship and Streamlining) they had a target goal of achieving CSS integration within all state Departments of Transportation by September 2007. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Organizations (AASHTO) is now (fall 2006) developing strategic goals and objectives for CSS which it describes as a \\"fundamental change in the way we do business.\\" One principal element of this change is the way transportation planners and engineers address speed. Historically, the speed at which a vehicle can safely travel through the landscape has been regarded as a primary goal of transportation planning since it shortens travel time, saves money (time is money), and improves driver convenience. However, CSS recognizes that designing a facility for the maximum safe speed that is economically feasible can be detrimental to other community goals, and even to vehicle passengers themselves. CSS recognizes that the goal of transportation is social and economic exchange, which cannot occur at high speeds. Instead, CSS attempts to identify, through a community-based process, a \\"target speed\\" that promotes the optimum amount of social and economic exchange, with lowest environmental impacts, that is appropriate for the context. Thus, in cities, if higher vehicle speeds lower the amount of social exchange on a residential street (fewer friends, less street life etc.) then the street will be designed to encourage drivers to slow down so as not to reduce social exchange. In a similar manner, commercial streets will be designed to maximize commercial exchange and designed accordingly. In more rural areas where a primary goal is to move people and goods between human settlements, CSS can be compatible with much higher design speeds. Setting a target speed that is appropriate for the context, and then designing roads, highway and streets to make it difficult for drivers to exceed that target speed, is a central CSS principle and represents a fundamental shift in transportation planning practice.

Known to the Hawaiians as Alika Napunako Adams. Britain Adams was born December 27, 1780 in Arbroath, Angus, Scotland. He said his father was John Fyfe, who he said was the \\"Earl of Fyfe\\", born in Arbroath c. 1754. His mother was Jean Adams, born in Arbroath c. 1758. Leaving Scotland in 1792, he worked 4 years aboard Zephyr belonging to Husson & Co. out of Newcastle upon Tyne, England. In 1796, he left Zephyr, and joined Calcutta out of Lancaster for two trips. He was drafted into naval service aboard after the Battle of Trafalgar in the Napoleonic Wars. Hawaii He arrived in Hawaii some time between 1809 and 1811 on the American trading ship Albatross from Boston. He met King Kamehameha I and joined English sailor John Young, who had arrived in 1790, to command the navy of the Kingdom of Hawaii. He was awarded control of over in the Niu Valley, including control over the Kupapa Fishpond, which he later filled in for purposes of growing sweet potatoes. (east of Honolulu, coordinates ). In April 1816 at Kawaihae Bay, Adams negotiated to buy a ship called Forrester under Captain John Ebbetts which had been owned by American John Jacob Astor. Prince Liholiho (soon to become King Kamehameha II) purchased the ship with sandalwood (Santalum ellipticum), and changed its name to Kaahumanu after his powerful stepmother Queen Kaahumanu. A condition of the deal was for Adams to take command of the ship. It was a small two-masted trading ship called a brig. On March 7, 1817, the Kingdom of Hawaii sent Adams to China on his ship to sell sandalwood. To enter the harbor, the ship paid $3000 in port charges, making it not a financial success. Upon returning October 5, 1817, at Hilo and hearing of the amount Adams had to pay, King Kamehameha decided Hawaii should also generate revenue from port charges. The Flag of Hawaii He refused to sail under the American flag once the War of 1812 broke out. When Adams sailed the Kaahumanu to China, it was the first vessel under the flag of Hawaii. Some traditions also credit him with designing the flag, though this honor has also been claimed for King Kamehameha I himself or another British sailor of the time, George C. Beckley. His reasoning for adding the British jack into the flag was due to the power of the British Empire at the time. He quotes \\"if we don't pledge allegiance to Britain we may all perish\\". He was sent to Kauai by Kamehemeha I to remove Russian Fort Elizabeth that had been set up in 1817. His words were \\"upon arriving they were soon dispatched\\". He stood on the shore with John Young when the first Christian missionaries anchored off shore in 1820. He helped convince the King to allow the missionaries to come ashore and speak to the King. He served as the Honolulu Harbor Pilot after Naihekukui left in 1823. When the arrived in 1825, Adams helped the Scottish naturalist distribute some plants he thought would be commercially successful in the tropical climate. Queen Kaahuman gave Adams over of land in Kalihi Valley (on the island of Oahu a few miles from Waikiki) in gratitude for his services. The area was called Apili. After 30 years of piloting, Adams retired in 1853, grew fruit on his land in Kalihi Valley, and was great host to visitors. Adams kept a journal which his notes were taken from and printed in Honolulu Star Bulltein May 4, 1935. Adams lived the remainder of his life in the Hawaiian islands, where he married three times and left many descendants. He was given the Hawaiian name Alika Napunako Adams. His first wife was Sarah Kaniaulono or Kale Davis, daughter of Isaac Davis. Two of his marriages were to Sarah Ulukaihonua Harbottle and then to her sister Charlotte Oili Harbottle (died 1893). Both were daughters of Papapaupu (or Papapaunauapu, the adopted grand daughter of King Kamehameha) and John Harbottle, another Scotsman serving as Honolulu pilot. By his account he had 15 children; 10 were still alive at the time of his death. He had a home on what was named Adams Lane in 1850, in his honor, a small lane in downtown Honolulu next to the Hawaiian Telephone company building at coordinates , as well as in Kalihi Valley. Adams died October 17, 1871. He is buried next to his friend and fellow Scotsman Andrew Auld in the Nuuanu Cemetery. Their common tombstone contains the following inscription in the Scots dialect: > \\"Twa croanies frae the land of heather, > Are sleepin' here in death th'gether.\\" The estate in Niu Valley was held by his granddaughter Mary Lucas, who started subdividing in the 1950s. The area created by the filling of Kupapa Fishpond is now the site of numerous oceanfront homes. One grandson of Lucas was Air Force General Benjamin B. Cassiday Jr., Another grandson is Nainoa Thompson, who revived the ancient Hawaiian craft of instrumentless navigation and founded the Polynesian Voyaging Society, which sponsors voyages by traditional Hawaiian sailing wa'a (canoes) Hokulea and Hawai'i Loa. Another was Paul R. Cassiday, trustee of the Campbell Estate.

Withrow Moraine is the only Ice Age terminal moraine on the Waterville Plateau section of the Columbia Plateau. The drumlin field includes excellent examples of glacially-formed elongated hills. Geologic History Drumlin left by Okanogan Lobe on the Waterville Plateau. =The plateau= The Withrow Moraine and Jameson Lake Drumlin Field National Natural Landmark is located on the Waterville Plateau, which lies in the northwest corner of the Columbia River Plateau. The plateau is formed on top of the Columbia River Basalt Group a large igneous province that lies across parts of the states of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho in the United States of America. During late Miocene and early Pliocene times, one of the largest flood basalts ever to appear on the earth's surface engulfed about 163,700 km¬≤ (63,000 mile¬≤) of the Pacific Northwest, forming a large igneous province with an estimated volume of 174,300 km¬≥. Eruptions were most vigorous from 17‚Äî14 million years ago, when over 99% of the basalt was released. Less extensive eruptions continued from 14‚Äî6 million years ago. These lava flows have been extensively exposed by the erosion resulting from the Missoula Floods, which laid bare many layers of the basalt flows on the edges of the plateau at Grand Coulee and Moses Coulee.Portions of this article, including a figure, are adapted from works of the United States Government, which are in the public domain =The glacial history= Illustration of the glacial impacts. Two million years ago the Pleistocene epoch began and Ice age glaciers invaded the area. They scoured the Columbia River Plateau, reaching as far south as the middle of the Waterville Plateau highlands above the Grand Coulee and south to the head of Moses Coulee. In some areas north of the Grand Coulee they were as much as 3 km (10000 feet) thick. Grooves in the exposed granite bedrock are still visible in the area from the movement of glaciers and numerous glacial erratics in the elevated to the Northwest of the coulee. =Progress of the Okanogan Lobe of the Cordilleran Glacier= Terminal moraine with multiple kames at the terminus of the Okanogan Lobe on the Waterville Plateau. The Okanogan lobe of the Cordilleran Glacier moved down the Okanogan River valley, covering 500 mi¬≤ of the Waterville Plateau and blocked the ancient route of the Columbia River, backing up water to create Glacial Lake Columbia and Lake Spokane. Initially water discharged from Lake Columbia by running up through the head of Grand Coulee and down through Foster Coulee to rejoin the Columbia River. As the glacier moved further south, Foster Coulee was cut off and the Columbia River then discharged through Moses Coulee, which runs southward slightly to the east of the ancient and current course of the Columbia. As the Okanogan lobe grew, it blocked Moses Coulee as well; the Columbia found the next lowest route through the region which was eroded to become the modern Grand Coulee. =After the glacier= As the Okanogan lobe melted, the northern half of the Waterville Plateau, including the upper portions of Moses Coulee, were littered with clear evidence of its passing. The glacier left behind a blanket of glacial till, up to 50 feet thick in places. This glacial till, composed of clay, silt, sand, gravel, cobblestones, and erratic boulders, covers most of the upper Moses Coulee. The melting glacier discharged both down Moses Coulee and into the Grand Coulee as is evident in the Sims Corner eskers and kames.Washington history link.

Adam was kidnapped by Jigsaw's apprentice Amanda Young and placed in a game alongside Dr. Gordon, which took place in a large dilapidated bathroom. Each of them were chained to pipes on opposite sides of the room and given specific instructions on what they needed to do in order to survive. Dr. Gordon had to kill Adam by six o'clock, while Adam simply had to escape. After failing to complete their respective tasks by the deadline they were confronted by Zep Hindle, an orderly from Dr. Gordon hospital. Adam beats Zep to death with a toilet tank lid, believing he is responsible for their abduction, and Dr. Gordon crawls away to get help, having sawed off his foot. While searching Zep's body for a key Adam finds a tape recorder which reveals that Zep was only following instructions in order to obtain an antidote for a poison in his blood stream. As the tape ends the real Jigsaw reveals himself, and seals the bathroom door, leaving Adam in the bathroom to die. Adam was later shown to have been killed out of guilt by Amanda Young in Saw III shortly after the end of the first Saw film, by suffocating him with a plastic bag. Adam's decomposing corpse is seen in Saw II, Saw III, and Saw 3D. In Saw II: Flesh & Blood Adam is mentioned in Tapp's files and audio tapes as having been hired by one of Tapp's colleagues to prove his wife was having an affair, implying this was why Tapp hired him. =Alison and Diana Gordon= * Portrayed by Monica Potter and Makenzie Vega * Appears in: Saw * Status: Alive Alison and Diana are the wife and daughter of Lawrence Gordon.

In Saw III, after Eric disappears, and is presumed dead, Kerry becomes wracked with guilt. She and Detective Mark Hoffman are called to the scene of an inescapable trap, and Kerry is the first to suspect that someone else was responsible, as the trap didn't follow Jigsaw's M.O. She is later captured and placed in her own trap, but even though she follows the rules, the trap (which was built and rigged by Amanda Young) tears her rib cage apart, killing her. Her corpse is later discovered by Officer Rigg and the FBI. It is revealed in Saw IV that Kerry's first name is Allison, as seen on a file observed by Officer Rigg. In Saw V a police memorial service is held honoring those who died in their effort to close the Jigsaw case; Allison Kerry was among the officers that were honored. =Amanda Young= Smith portrayed Amanda Young, John's apprentice. * Portrayed by Shawnee Smith (film) and Jen Taylor (game) * Appears in: Saw: Rebirth, Saw, Saw II, Saw III, Saw IV, Saw V, Saw VI, Saw 3D, Saw: The Video Game * Status: Deceased * Died in: Saw III In Saw, Amanda is introduced as a heroin addict, and the first person to survive one of Jigsaw's \\"games\\" (notably, the only known survivor at the time of Saw), who ultimately believes that John helped her.

Evidence led him to suspect that Dr. Lawrence Gordon was the Jigsaw Killer. Tapp and his partner Steven Sing later found Jigsaw's warehouse, but before they could apprehend him, he activated a trap, which threatened the life of Jeff Ridenhour. Sing rushed to help the victim while Tapp attempted to arrest Jigsaw, but Jigsaw slashed Tapp's throat with a concealed blade and fled.

He failed to do so, but severed his own foot to free himself from his shackle, and crawled away to get help, promising Adam he would bring someone back. Lawrence passed out after using a hot steam pipe to cauterize his ankle stump. John found him unconscious shortly after and congratulated him for surviving. He then helped Lawrence recover, and gave him a prosthetic foot. John recruited Lawrence afterwards, and used his medical skills to prepare other traps. He prepared a variety of traps for John, such as putting the key in Michael's eye in the venus flytrap (Saw II), as well as sewing Art Blank's mouth and Trevor's eyes shut for the mausoleum trap (Saw IV). He also selected Lynn Denlon as John's surgeon (Saw III) and wrote an anonymous message to Detective Mark Hoffman (Saw V) stating \\"I KNOW WHO YOU ARE\\". Following John's death, his ex-wife Jill Tuck delivered a package to Lawrence that had been left to her in John's will; it contained a videotape with instructions from John to watch over Jill and act on his behalf if anything was to happen to her. When Hoffman kills Jill and attempts to flee the city, he is ambushed by three people in pig masks, led by Lawrence. After chaining Hoffman by the ankle to the pipes in the bathroom, Lawrence picks up the hacksaw he had used to sever his own foot and throws it into the corridor.

Sing shot the drills and pursued Jigsaw through the warehouse, after Jigsaw slashed Tapp's throat with a hidden wrist blade. While pursuing him, Sing accidentally activated a tripwire which triggered four overhead shotguns to discharge, killing him. Tapp blamed himself for Sing's death, which ultimately caused him to obsess over capturing Jigsaw. In Saw V a police memorial service was held honoring those who died in their effort to close the Jigsaw case; Sing was among the officers honored.

Lawrence failed, but Alison and Diana managed to escape when Detective Tapp arrived and chased Zep to an underground sewage system. After shooting Tapp, Zep proceeded to the site of Adam and Lawrence's test. Zep prepared to kill Lawrence since he shot Adam after the deadline, but Adam, having survived the gunshot, knocks Zep to the floor and beats him to death with a toilet tank cover, believing him to be their captor. Throughout the film the audience is led to believe Zep is Jigsaw; it's not revealed until the end that Zep is a victim of Jigsaw's game rather than Jigsaw himself. On the DVD commentary for Saw, Leigh Whannell and James Wan stated that Zep enjoyed the sense of power he is given over others which he did not have before.

While Jill is in protective custody, Hoffman infiltrates the station and kills her with the reverse bear trap. Her death is subsequently avenged by Dr. Lawrence Gordon, who was instructed in a tape left for him by John to watch over Jill and to act immediately on John's behalf if anything happened to her.

Saw V reveals that Hoffman's sister was murdered by her abusive boyfriend, and that Hoffman took revenge by placing him in an inescapable trap made to look like one of John's. John found out about the trap and blackmailed Hoffman into working for him, but Hoffman eventually became a willing apprentice and aided him in nearly every subsequent trap. When Agent Peter Strahm closes in on him, Hoffman kills and frames him. In Saw VI, he kills two FBI agents and a technician who threaten to expose his secret.

Art first appeared in a trap that pits him against another victim, Trevor. Both were chained at the neck to a winch and Art's mouth was sewn shut, as were Trevor's eyes, rendering communication impossible. Trevor panics and attempts to kill Art and Art is forced to kill Trevor in order to retrieve the key attached to his collar, tearing his mouth open in the process. He later has a hand in setting up the tests for Daniel Rigg. He is tasked with keeping Eric Matthews and Mark Hoffman alive throughout the 90 minutes of Rigg's tests, wearing a device strapped to his back with a set of pincers poised to cut through his spine.

As Jill Tuck was closing down her drug rehabilitation clinic for the night, he begged her to let him back in; once inside, he robbed the facility and shoved a door into her stomach while fleeing, inadvertently causing her to have a miscarriage. John later abducted Cecil and placed him in the first Jigsaw trap: a chair with razor blade restraints, from which he can only escape by pushing his face through a set of knives. The chair collapsed and Cecil charged at John, who stepped aside allowing Cecil to fall into a tangle of razor wire, killing him. In Saw VI, it is shown that Cecil robbed Jill's clinic at Amanda Young's request. =Crime Scene Photographer= * Portrayed by Joanne Boland * Appears in: Saw IV * Status: Deceased * Died in: Saw IV The Crime Scene Photographer discovers a bullet at the scene of Allison Kerry's trap clamped between Kerry's corpse and the trap.

Enraged, Rigg forces Ivan into a prearranged trap, and supplies him with the tools to escape: two buttons that will drive blades into his eyes. Ivan only blinds one eye before the 60-second timer runs out, and the trap rips off three of his limbs and throws his body across the room. =Lindsey Perez= * Portrayed by Athena Karkanis * Appears in: Saw IV, Saw V, Saw VI * Status: Deceased * Died in: Saw VI Lindsey Perez is an FBI agent assigned to the Jigsaw case along with her partner, Agent Peter Strahm.

Lindsey barely escapes death when Strahm pulled her out of the firing path of a harpoon (which in turn hit a crime scene photographer). Minutes later, they entered a room where they were confronted with a Billy doll and a tape meant for Lindsey. As she leaned in to hear the tape, the Billy doll's face exploded sending shrapnel into her face and neck. In Saw V, it is implied that she died from her injuries; her last words to Strahm were \\"Detective Hoffman\\", leading to Strahm's initial suspicion regarding Hoffman.

Rex and Morgan are later put into a Jigsaw test as part of Rigg's game. The pair are locked back to back in a harness, their bodies impaled with several long spikes. A tape left for Morgan informs her that she could free herself by removing the spikes but would kill Rex in the process. When Rigg found the pair, Rex was dead and Morgan was unconscious, having removed all but one spike. He gave her the key to the harness and told her she would have to save herself, then set off a fire alarm to alert the authorities to her location.

His investigation leads him to the Gideon Meatpacking Plant, where he discovers the corpses of Jigsaw, Amanda, and Lynn, in the makeshift sickroom. Strahm kills Jeff Denlon in self-defense before Hoffman locks him in. Early in Saw V, Strahm finds a hidden exit, but is captured and placed in a trap (a glass cube around his head which fills with water) meant to kill him. He survives by removing a pen from his shirt pocket and using the plastic tube to perform a makeshift tracheotomy on himself. Subsequently, his boss, Dan Erickson, removes him from the case. Strahm conducts his own investigation, now suspicious of Hoffman. He is eventually crushed to death in a trap room when he fails to follow Hoffman's instructions, and Hoffman plants his cell phone at a crime scene to frame him as Jigsaw's second accomplice. In Saw VI Hoffman emerges from the caskin below the trap and uses Strahm's severed hand to place his fingerprints at additional crime scenes. As soon as Agents Lindsey Perez and Dan Erickson unravel the deception, Hoffman murders them and again leaves Strahm's fingerprints at the scene before setting it on fire. =Tracy Rigg= * Portrayed by Ingrid Hart * Appears in: Saw IV * Status: Alive Tracy Rigg, the wife of Daniel Rigg, is often home alone because he spends so much time at his job.

William ultimately decides to save Emily and Shelby, who are respectively the second and fifth to be stopped on the carousel. Aaron (the first), Gena (the second), Dave (the third), and Josh (the fourth and final) are left to die in that order. In Saw 3D, Emily is part of Bobby Dagen's support group. =Debbie= * Portrayed by Caroline Cave * Appears in: Saw VI * Status: Deceased * Died in: Saw VI Debbie is the attorney for Umbrella Health and William Easton. She is kidnapped, tied up and placed in William's third test at the abandoned Rowan Zoological Institute; a device is strapped to her chest which will shoot a spear through her head unless she reaches the end of a steel cage maze in 90 seconds. After Debbie unties herself, William has to help her by diverting jets of scalding steam away from her path and onto himself. After reaching the end of the maze, she discovers that the key to her device is sewn into William's side. She attacks him with a circular saw but is unable to retrieve the key before her time runs out, and the device activates, killing her, and she falls to the bottom of the shaft. =Eddie= * Portrayed by Marty Moreau * Appears in: Saw VI * Status: Deceased * Died in: Saw VI Eddie is a predatory lending banker and a part of a game in Saw VI, along with his co-worker Simone, in which they are placed in adjoining cells. He wears a head harness with screws poised at the temples, and has a knife and a meat cleaver.

Eddie, being overweight, slices several chunks of flesh from his stomach, but Simone severs her left arm and tips the scale in her favor, leading to Eddie's death. =Hank= * Portrayed by Gerry Mendicino * Appears in: Saw VI * Status: Deceased * Died in: Saw VI Hank is a janitor for Umbrella Health, working for William Easton. He is kidnapped and placed in the first of William's four tests, a vice-like trap which will crush either his or William's chest, leaving only one survivor.

Even though William encourages Hank to hold his breath he is unable to do so, and continues breathing heavily until the vice crushes him. =Harold Abbott= * Portrayed by George Newbern * Appears in: Saw VI * Status: Deceased * Died in: Saw VI Harold is the husband of Tara and father of Brent. Flashbacks throughout Saw VI reveal that his health insurance policy was revoked by William Easton due to a discrepancy found on his application, and he eventually died from heart disease.

His ultimate fate is unknown. =Simone= * Portrayed by Tanedra Howard * Appears in: Saw VI, Saw 3D * Status: Alive Simone is a predatory lending banker, who is placed in a game with her co- worker Eddie. They are placed in adjoining cells. Since they have figuratively extracted \\"pounds of flesh\\" from loan recipients who they knew could never pay them back, they will literally have to do the same in order to survive. She wears a head harness with screws poised at the temples, and has a knife and a meat cleaver. A balance scale is placed between her and Eddie's cell; whichever one cuts off the most weight in flesh in sixty seconds will live, while the other will be killed by the screws boring into his or her skull. Eddie, being overweight, slices several chunks of flesh from his stomach, but Simone chops off her left arm and tips the scale in her favor. Simone survives and is later questioned by Hoffman and the FBI in her hospital room. She angrily lashes out at Hoffman when he asks her if she learned anything from her experience. Simone appears in Saw 3D, at Bobby Dagen's support group, still bitter from her experience and wearing a prosthetic arm. =William Easton= * Portrayed by Peter Outerbridge * Appears in: Saw VI, Saw 3D * Status: Deceased * Died in: Saw VI William Easton is an insurance executive at Umbrella Health who is tested in Saw VI. He helped fund Jill Tuck's rehab clinic; later, he informed John that his company would not cover the cost of an experimental treatment for John's cancer, based on a probability formula he invented, which his company uses to reject insurance coverage for people with fatal conditions. He is placed in the abandoned Rowan Zoological Institute and given 60 minutes to complete four tests, or else the explosives strapped to his limbs will detonate. The tests force him to make decisions about who will live or die and re-examine his policy. After completing his tests William is confronted by Tara and Brent (the widow and son of a man whose coverage had been cancelled by William, and subsequently died as a result). William learns that Tara and Brent have the choice to either let William live or kill him. He, along with his captured sister, Pamela Jenkins, convince Tara to let him live, but Brent activates a device that drives a bed of needles into William's back. A vat of hydrofluoric acid is pumped through the needles, dissolving his body in half and killing him. He is mentioned in Saw 3D on a newscast stating that his remains were found along with the other victims from Saw VI. Saw 3D =Bobby Dagen= * Portrayed by Sean Patrick Flanery * Appears in: Saw 3D * Status: Unknown (likely alive) Bobby Dagen is the author of a self-help book based on his accounts of surviving a Jigsaw trap. In reality, however, he made the entire story up in order to find quick fame and success. He is abducted and put into a series of six tests at the abandoned Clear Dawn Psychiatric Hospital, along with his wife Joyce and three of his key staff members. The first test requires him to escape from a cage suspended above a series of spikes on the floor, which he achieves by releasing the cage's bottom end and swinging himself far enough to jump free. The next three tests each lead to the death of one of his staff members; in the fifth, he must pull out two of his teeth in order to obtain the combination to the door leading to Joyce. For the final test, he must undergo the ordeal that he claimed to have endured in his book: drive two meathooks through his pectoral muscles, then haul himself up to connect two extension cords and shut off the electrified wire around Joyce's platform. As he is about to plug in the cords, the hooks tear through his flesh and he drops to the floor, and he watches helplessly as a large metal capsule slams shut around Joyce and she is incinerated within it. His ultimate fate is left unknown. =Brad, Dina, and Ryan= * Portrayed by Sebastian Pigott (Brad), Anne Lee Greene (Dina), Jon Cor (Ryan) * Appears in: Saw 3D * Status: Brad and Ryan Alive; Dina Deceased * Died in: Saw 3D (Dina only) These three victims are placed in a storefront window at a public shopping center.

Billy the puppet informs them that Dina has manipulated both men's affections for her in order to coerce them into stealing for her. Since she claimed to love each man, they will have the chance to fight for her love and their survival. In order to free her, one will have to push the carriage to the other's end within 60 seconds, killing him; alternatively, they can spare each other and Dina will die once the timer runs out. After a brief fight in which Dina tries convincing both men to kill each other, Brad is slightly wounded. Ryan then offers a truce and they allow Dina to be cut in half by the center wheel. They are later seen at Bobby Dagen's Jigsaw survivors meeting. According to the producers' commentary, Brad and Ryan are the two men in the pig masks that help Lawrence Gordon abduct Hoffman. =Cale= * Portrayed by Dean Armstrong * Appears in: Saw 3D * Status: Deceased * Died in: Saw 3D Cale is Bobby Dagen's best friend and co- conspirator.

In order to save them and himself, Evan must tear himself loose from the seat and pull a lever protruding from the car's engine compartment within 30 seconds. He fails to do so, and the car is dropped off its jacks, crushing Kara's head. As it speeds forward, Dan's arms and jaw are ripped off, Jake is hit and killed, and the car crashes into a pile of wrecked cars outside, causing Evan to go flying through the windshield and killing him. Mark Hoffman later steals Dan's corpse in order to use it as a decoy, while hiding in its body bag in order to sneak into the police station and find Jill Tuck. =Donna Evans= * Portrayed by Christine Simpson * Appears in: Saw 3D * Status: Alive Donna Evans is the host of Daybreak, a talk show produced at the Stage 6 Studios, who invited Bobby Dagen for an interview.

She offers to turn over evidence of Mark Hoffman's crimes in exchange for police protection and immunity from prosecution. When Gibson was a uniformed officer, he was attacked by a homeless man who took his gun; Hoffman ordered the man to drop the weapon, then killed him. The incident led Gibson to mistrust Hoffman from that moment on, and he and his partner Rogers lead the efforts to find him. Clues left by Hoffman lead Gibson to the observation area of Bobby Dagen's tests, where he and the two officers accompanying him are killed by a remote- controlled machine gun placed in the room. =Nina= * Portrayed by Naomi Snieckus * Appears in: Saw 3D * Status: Deceased * Died in: Saw 3D Nina is Bobby Dagen's publicist, who is accused of \\"speaking no evil\\" by being his greatest link to the media but never revealing the truth of Bobby being a fraud. She is brought to the abandoned Clear Dawn Psychiatric Hospital; locked in a straitjacket and surrounded by four spikes aimed at her neck, Nina has a fishing line down her throat, with a key on the hook at its end. Bobby has 60 seconds to pull the hook up from her stomach. Attached to the mechanism is a decibel meter that brings the spikes closer to Nina whenever the sound level rises above a whisper.

She reveals that she had been placed in a trap with her abusive boyfriend, Alex. Hanging above a series of upturned lawnmowers, Alex tried to kick her to her death to save himself but was instead struck back by her, causing him to fall into the lawnmowers and be sliced to death. She was freed after this and came to value her life more for overcoming her abuser and surviving. =Suzanne= * Portrayed by Rebecca Marshall * Appears in: Saw 3D * Status: Deceased * Died in: Saw 3D Suzanne is Bobby Dagen's lawyer, who is accused of \\"seeing no evil\\" by ignoring her duty as a lawyer and turning a blind eye to Bobby's fraud. Her test occurs at the abandoned Clear Dawn Psychiatric Hospital; she is placed horizontally inside a steel frame that begins to rotate her in a standing position, where three spikes are placed to pierce her eyes and mouth. To save her, Bobby must lift a pair of weights at shoulder height and hold them for at least 30 seconds, until the 60 second timer expires, in order to stop Suzanne's rig from approaching the spikes. However, as he does this, two rods pierce his sides. Bobby attempts to hold it, but continues to drop it. Suzanne is inches from death, and with just one second left, Bobby drops it and she is killed. Jigsaw =Anna= * Portrayed by Laura Vandervoort * Appears in: Jigsaw * Status: Deceased * Died in: Jigsaw Anna is one of the five victims in the barn games. While she and her husband lived next door to John Kramer, she was enraged by her baby's constant crying. She suffocated it to death and placed the body in bed next to her husband Matthew to make it seem as if he had rolled over onto the baby. Matthew went insane and was committed to a mental institution, where he later committed suicide. In the third trap, she and Mitch are locked in a grain silo, at risk of being buried alive or cut to death by the grain and sharp objects pouring in. They are saved when Ryan pulls a lever to release them, at the cost of severing his own leg. Later, in the fifth game, she and Ryan are chained to pipes at opposite sides of a room and given a shotgun loaded with one shell. Anna tries to shoot Ryan, but the gun explodes in her face and kills her, having been rigged to backfire. =Carly= * Portrayed by Brittany Allen * Appears in: Jigsaw * Status: Deceased * Died in: Jigsaw Carly is one of the five victims in the barn games. She had stolen a purse from a woman who suffered from asthma; without her inhaler, the woman suffered a fatal asthma attack when she gave chase. For the second game, she is presented with three hypodermic syringes, one of which contains the antidote for a poison that has been injected into her system. Another contains saline solution, and the third holds a lethal acid. If she does nothing, she and the other three still-living victims (Anna, Mitch, and Ryan) will be lifted off their feet and strangled to death by the collars locked around their necks. She refuses to choose and fights Ryan. However, he overpowers her and injects all three syringes into her neck, dissolving her face and killing her. =Edgar Munsen= * Portrayed by Josiah Black * Appears in: Jigsaw * Status: Deceased * Died in: Jigsaw Edgar Munsen was a meth addict, and criminal, having been arrested twice, once for the murder of Christine Nelson, but was released by Halloran. Munsen was later put in a test by the new Jigsaw: find and trigger a mechanism to activate a game, or die.

Munsen is later abducted, and found buried in John Kramer's grave with his throat slit. =Eleanor Bonneville= * Portrayed by Hannah Emily Anderson * Appears in: Jigsaw * Status: Alive Eleanor Bonneville assists Logan Nelson in performing autopsies of crime victims for the police department. She has a deep fascination with the Jigsaw murders, bordering on obsession, and has built replicas of several Jigsaw traps. When she shows her work to Logan, Keith Hunt follows them and takes pictures, leading Halloran to order their arrest. Based on analysis of trace evidence on the latest victims' bodies, she determines the location of the new game, an abandoned pig farm, and takes Logan there; Halloran follows and ambushes them, but she escapes and flags down a car. =Detective Halloran= * Portrayed by Callum Keith Rennie * Appears in: Jigsaw * Status: Deceased * Died in: Jigsaw Halloran is a homicide detective in the city police department. He takes the lead role in the investigation of several deaths in which jigsaw puzzle pieces have been cut from the bodies; all the victims are associated in some way with his past cases. He begins to suspect medical examiner Logan Nelson and his assistant Eleanor Bonneville of being involved, and trails them to an abandoned pig farm where the new games are being played. During a fight with Logan, both men are knocked out and placed in collars with laser cutters set to kill them unless they confess their sins. After forcing Logan to go first, Halloran admits that he had taken bribes and planted evidence, allowing guilty criminals to go free and innocent people to be sent to prison in their place. After tape recording this confession and planting evidence to frame Halloran as the new Jigsaw, Logan activates the collar and slices his head open, killing him. =Detective Keith Hunt= * Portrayed by Cl√© Bennett * Appears in: Jigsaw * Status: Alive Keith Hunt is Halloran's partner in the homicide squad, but has been assigned there from the internal affairs office to keep an eye on him. Hunt follows Logan and Eleanor to Eleanor's studio and secretly takes pictures of the Jigsaw trap replicas that she has built, leading Halloran to suspect Logan and/or Eleanor of being the perpetrator of the new games. Hunt arrests Logan on Halloran's orders, but releases him after finding evidence (planted by Logan) that implicates Halloran as the new Jigsaw. =Logan Nelson= * Portrayed by Matt Passmore * Appears in: Jigsaw * Status: Alive Logan Nelson is the medical examiner for the city police department. He had served with the United States Army in Fallujah during the Iraq War, but was captured, interrogated, and tortured by the enemy. This experience, combined with the trauma of his wife Christine's murder, leads Halloran to suspect him as the new Jigsaw. When he and his assistant, Eleanor Bonneville, find the site of the new game, Halloran ambushes them; both he and Halloran are knocked out and placed in collars rigged to fire laser cutters at their heads unless they confess their wrongdoing. Logan appears to die when his collar activates, but then stands up alive and well after Halloran admits to his own unethical behavior as a police officer. Logan reveals to Halloran that 10 years ago, while working at a hospital, he had inadvertently mixed up John Kramer's x-rays with those of another patient, leading to a delay in treatment for John's cancer that allowed it to become terminal. He was placed into one of John's games, in which he was wounded on a set of circular saws. Choosing to spare Logan because he had made an honest mistake, John recruited him as an apprentice. In the present, Logan sets up a new barn game using three people associated with Halloran's past cases (including Christine's murder) in order to draw him in and frame him as the new Jigsaw. With Halloran's confession on tape, Logan activates Halloran's collar which slices his head open. =Matthew= * Portrayed by Edward Ruttle * Appears in: Jigsaw * Status: Deceased * Died in: Jigsaw Matthew was Anna's husband and John's neighbor.

He had sold a motorcycle to John Kramer's nephew years earlier, concealing the fact that the brakes were faulty, and the nephew had died in an accident as a result. During the third game, he and Anna are locked in a grain silo and at risk of being buried alive or cut to death by the grain and sharp objects pouring in. Ryan saves them by pulling a lever, which severs his lower leg. For the fourth game, Mitch is suspended upside down and slowly lowered toward a helical blade spun by the engine of that same motorcycle. In order to save himself, he must reach down through the center of the blade and pull the engine's brake handle. Anna jams the mechanism for a few seconds, but before Mitch can reach the brake, it starts spinning again and slices him to death. =Ryan= * Portrayed by Paul Braunstein * Appears in: Jigsaw * Status: Deceased * Died in: Jigsaw Ryan is one of the five victims in the barn games. While in high school, his drunken carousing led to a car accident in which two of his friends and the driver of the other car were killed. During the third game, he tries to leave the barn through a door marked \\"No Exit\\", but steps on a rigged patch of floor and gets his leg caught in a set of sharpened steel cables that slowly constrict, tearing into his flesh. When Anna and Mitch become trapped in a grain silo under a flood of pouring grain and sharp objects, he must pull a lever to save them and free himself; doing so causes the cables to sever his lower leg. Later, in the fifth game, he and Anna are chained to pipes at opposite sides of a room and given a shotgun loaded with one shell. Anna tries to shoot Ryan, but the gun explodes in her face and kills her, having been rigged to backfire. Ryan discovers that the keys to free both of them had been inside the shotgun shell, but the gun's discharge destroyed them and left him with no way to free himself. It is revealed that he later died and his body was left in the barn to rot. Saw: The Video Game =Jennings Foster= * Portrayed by Troy Lund * Appears in: Saw: The Video Game, Saw II: Flesh & Blood Jennings is the head of a CSI team who cooperates with David Tapp's department to solve murder cases. Unbeknownst to others, Jennings committed a hit-and-run years ago that led him to frame an innocent citizen to avoid conviction himself. For this, Jigsaw places Jennings as a victim for Tapp to save in a pendulum trap. Tapp saves him, but Jennings blames Tapp for being there and runs away. He also makes a brief appearance in Saw II: Flesh & Blood, where he is seen assisting the investigation into Tapp's death and photographing the crime scene at David Tapp's apartment. In one of the case files, he seems to be very grateful towards Tapp for saving his life. =Melissa Sing= * Portrayed by Kahn Doan * Appears in: Saw: The Video Game Melissa is the widow of Detective Steven Sing, who is killed after falling victim to one of Jigsaw's traps in Saw. Upon Sing's death, Melissa becomes a neglectful parent to her son, Franklin and blames David Tapp for ruining her family. For this, she is placed in Whitehurst Asylum during Saw: The Video Game in an iron-maiden trap for Tapp to save her from. Tapp saves her, but she left him quickly. During the finale of the game, if the player chooses the Truth door, Melissa is revealed to have been held against her will following her trap and was forced to help Jigsaw, keeping Tapp's game going until 6:00, or her son would die. Attempting to evade Tapp, she is accidentally killed by a shotgun trap. However, in the Freedom ending, she is saved along with the other surviving victims in the asylum and set free, never having her incidental ties to Jigsaw revealed. A file written by Tapp in Saw II: Flesh & Blood confirmed that Melissa survived the events of the previous game. =Oswald McGillicutty= * Portrayed by David Scully * Appears in: Saw (mentioned), Saw: The Video Game. Oswald is the newspaper writer who coined the nickname \\"The Jigsaw Killer\\". One of his articles is seen in Saw. In the game, Oswald is placed in Whitehurst Asylum due to Jigsaw believing Oswald is perverting his message and also for accusing Tapp of being the real Jigsaw Killer. It is revealed in case files that Oswald was originally writing a novel about Jigsaw, but his notes were stolen by Pamela Jenkins in an effort to thwart him and write a book of her own. Tapp finds Oswald in a folding table trap, which he releases him from, only to be killed by sharp slabs of metal immediately after. =Pighead= * Appears in: Saw: The Video Game Pighead is a masked person who works for Jigsaw. He appears in Saw: The Video Game and watches over Detective Tapp's game. He is shown to be hostile and is witnessed by Detective Tapp killing several test subjects around Whitehurst Asylum. Pighead seems to taunt Detective Tapp throughout the game, and sometimes attempts to come after him. Later on near the end of the game, Detective Tapp is required to fight Pighead, who wants to kill Tapp and sabotage his game in order to surpass Jigsaw. Tapp manages to kill Pighead and get hold of a key to the library where his final choice is awaiting. Jigsaw rhetorically asks Tapp if he's a \\"murderer\\" for killing his servant. Pighead wears a red boxer robe and the infamous pig mask concealing his identity. He is referenced in one of David Tapp's audio tapes in Saw II: Flesh & Blood, with Tapp feeling guilt having killed him, not knowing if the person in the costume had a family or is another victim forced to obey Jigsaw. Saw II: Flesh & Blood =Michael Tapp= * Appears in: Saw II: Flesh & Blood Michael Tapp is Detective David Tapp's estranged son and one of the two main protagonists and the main playable character in Saw II: Flesh & Blood. He is a reporter, investigating his father's recent death when he is captured by Pighead II and forced to undergo a series of lethal traps set up by Jigsaw. As he progresses through the game he saves several people, freeing Henry, Sarah, Joseph, Carla, and Solomon while surviving other victims loose in the game; criminals previously arrested by his father after revenge on his son. Though initially friendly, Henry, and later Joseph, begins stalking Michael in order to kill him and prevent his corruption and role in a drug cartel being revealed, should Michael escape. Henry is killed by Pighead II before he can kill him however and Michael is able to kill Joseph himself. During the game, Michael is revealed to have abused his strained relationship with his father to steal documents pertaining to the Jigsaw case, including Tapp's botched sting that resulted in Detective Steven Sing's death. Using this information for personal gain and revenge against his father for feelings of abandonment, Michael wrote an expos√© which destroyed his father's career, unwittingly aiding the drug cartel run by Henry and Joseph, and partially contributing to his father's eventual suicide. In the finale, it is revealed that Campbell and Michael's tests had occurred concurrently, with Michael's fate left in Campbell's hands. Campbell is given the choice at the end of his own test to sacrifice himself for Michael, a stranger, or save himself at Michael's expense. If Campbell chooses himself, Michael is trapped and crushed to death by a spiked moving ceiling. If Campbell sacrifices himself, Michael survives. Jigsaw reveals that Michael's real test is to see if he had the ability to punish the corrupt (Henry and Joseph) and so he is given a choice between two doors; one leads Michael to freedom and the chance to use the evidence found by his father to print the story of Jigsaw and the drug cartel. The other door reveals a Pighead costume and an offer to help people see the truth inside themselves, implying Michael can become Jigsaw's apprentice. The choice made is not revealed to the player. =Campbell Iman= * Appears in: Saw II: Flesh & Blood Campbell is one of the two main protagonists and the brief playable character of Saw II: Flesh & Blood. He is targeted by Jigsaw because of his addiction to drugs and his estrangement from his son, who is also a drug addict. His last name is mentioned in a case file which also revealed that he has lymphoma. Jigsaw places him in a \\"Venus Fly Trap\\" device which he escapes by cutting out a key buried near his own eye. After traversing several traps, Campbell is informed that there is another subject, Michael Tapp, in the game and that only one may live. Campbell is given the choice of sacrificing himself for a stranger, who has a potentially long life ahead of him, or saving himself, knowing he has a short time left to live because of his cancer. This choice decides the fate of Michael Tapp at the end of the game. If Campbell sacrifices himself, he gets crushed by spiked moving walls. If Campbell chooses to save himself, Michael dies and Campbell meets Jigsaw who informs him that his son is safe, having passed his own test prior to the events of the game, and all he has to do is leave through the exit. Campbell instead attempts to attack Jigsaw only to be killed by a concealed, falling scythe. =Henry Jacobs= * Appears in: Saw II: Flesh & Blood Henry is the Chief of Police in David Tapp's precinct. He is involved in the Jigsaw cases and is the chief officer involved in the investigation into Detective Tapp's death. Henry is involved in a conspiracy alongside Joseph, Carla, and Sarah to steal seized drugs and sell them on the streets, bringing him to Jigsaw's attention. When Michael finds him, Henry is strapped to a chair with a revolver placed in his mouth that will fire unless Michael can pass a test. Even though he appears helpful upon his release, he begins stalking Michael throughout the game in order to kill him and prevent his corruption from being revealed. After Joseph escapes, Henry finds and allies himself with Joseph in order to find Michael and any others who could reveal their secrets, leading him to murder Carla Song. Henry later runs into Pighead II, who stabs him repeatedly in the chest. =Joseph Poltzer= * Appears in: Saw II: Flesh & Blood Joseph is a corrupt vice cop who abused his position to steal drugs seized from criminals and sell them in a cartel, alongside Henry, Carla, and Sarah. As a member of the group, he is kidnapped by Jigsaw and placed in a vice trap designed to crush all of his limbs and his skull unless Michael can save him. Michael's father had accidentally uncovered their drug cartel while investigating Jigsaw, so he teamed up with Henry Jacobs to hunt and kill Michael, Carla, and Sarah to tie up any loose ends that could reveal their criminal actions. He later executes Sarah as she is about to reveal the true identity of Pighead II. He and Michael get embroiled in a fight which results in them breaking through a wall and plummeting into an alley below. They struggle over Joseph's gun, but Michael eventually triumphs and fatally shoots Joseph in the head. =Pighead II = * Appears in: Saw II: Flesh & Blood Pighead II is a replacement for the Pighead, who died during the events of the first game. Little is known about the character except that he is garbed in similar attire to the original Pighead and that he is involved in placing some individuals into their respective traps, including Carla. Throughout the game, he can be seen kidnapping Michael and killing other victims. He later corners and kills Henry Jacobs. Before her death, Sarah Blalok indicated that Michael Tapp knew the man behind the pig mask and that he is a friend of his father's. However, she is killed before she reveals his identity. Although Pighead appears to work for Jigsaw, he commits acts of murder against his philosophy. Although his identity is never confirmed, it is possible that Pighead II is Mark Hoffman, since Hoffman knew Tapp and he was a murderer, unlike Jigsaw. =Sarah Blalok= * Appears in: Saw II: Flesh & Blood Sarah is a drug addict, prostitute, and an informant for David Tapp. Tapp gives her a second chance by helping her escape from her previous life. Following his death, however, she begins to fall back into her previous lifestyle. She blames Michael Tapp for betraying his father and contributing to his suicide. Michael finds her trapped in a sealed tank slowly filling with water and is forced to solve a puzzle to free her before she drowns. Though initially hostile towards Michael, she later becomes more friendly, explaining that his father loved Michael even after his betrayal. She is revealed to have been part of a criminal conspiracy alongside Carla, Henry, and Joseph; her role being to sell drugs on the streets. While searching for Jigsaw, David Tapp discovers their drug cartel and Sarah is used to mislead him, even though she is aware that he is not concerned about the drug cartel because of his obsession with Jigsaw. Through her own admission, it is revealed that she had feelings for Tapp. She is found by Joseph Poltzer as she is about to disclose the identity of Pighead II. Joseph sneaks up on Sarah and shoots her in the head. =Solomon Bates= * Appears in: Saw II: Flesh & Blood Solomon is an accountant involved in a housing development project with John Kramer and Art Blank before the events that would turn John into Jigsaw. He is later responsible for using his accountancy role to hide the illegal money made by the drug cartel consisting of Henry, Joseph, Carla, and Sarah, thus bringing him to Jigsaw's attention. Solomon is initially found trapped inside a movable cage alongside Michael during the latter's first test prepared by Jigsaw. Both men had to race to push their cages over a floor covered in broken glass towards the exit, with the winner receiving their freedom. Solomon manages to reach the end first and escapes. After Jigsaw gives Michael a second chance, Michael later encounters Solomon again during his trials. Solomon is seen chained to a suspended cart set on a track filled with slowly rising flames that will burn him alive unless Michael pushes him out of harm's way. Upon his release, he reveals the truth about the members of the drug cartel and that Michael's father accidentally stumbled on their operations during his search for Jigsaw. He is last seen being cornered by Pighead II and thrown into a pit of syringes. Pighead II then seals the door before Michael can enter. =Zeke= * Appears in: Saw II: Flesh & Blood Zeke is a Jigsaw victim whose original trap mangles his hands beyond repair, stripping away much of the flesh. He is a pedophile who molested little girls. He is saved from his trap by Michael, but passes out from blood loss. Between this event and the events of the game, he has his damaged forearms replaced with large blades and becomes psychotic, chasing and attempting to kill Michael at any opportunity. Michael manages to lure him in between two spiked wall devices in front of a doorway that snap shut and crush him.

He is the son of former politician and footballer, John Donnellan and grandson of politician and footballer Michael Donnellan. All them have captained the Galway football team in their careers. Michael was one of the most exciting players in the GAA during his playing career. Playing career Donnellan first came to prominence as a member of the talented St Jarlath's College in Tuam team of the early nineties. He played a crucial role in their Hogan Cup winning season of 1994, alongside future Galway team-mates Declan Meehan, Tom√°s Meehan, John Divilly, Tommy Joyce and Padraic Joyce. They reached the Connacht final the following year but lost out to their biggest rivals, St. Patrick's College, Tuam. He would later once more star alongside Joyce with the Tralee IT team that won the 1998 Sigerson Cup. In 1998, Donnellan won his first All-Ireland medal, as part of the Galway side that won the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship in 1998. During the first half of the final against Kildare, Donnellan picked up the ball inside the heart of his own defence and proceeded to go on an amazing run, soloing the length of the field while exchanging a one-two with Kevin Walsh in the midfield. As he approached the Kildare goal, he laid the ball off to Derek Savage who passed to Sean √ìg De Paor. De Paor slotted the ball over the bar. The score re- invigorated the Galway team, who were losing at the time. Donnellan's overall performance inspired Galway to their first football title in 32 years and completed a unique hat-trick of senior All-Ireland medals for his family, as he followed in the footsteps of his father John (1966) and his grandfather Mick (1925). The final score was 1‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì10. That solo run was later voted No.1 in the Top 20 GAA Moments, in 2003. He was named Texaco Footballer of the Year that year. After reaching another final in 2000, losing out to Kerry after a replay, Donnellan & Galway returned to win the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. After losing to Roscommon in the Connacht semi-final, Galway entered the newly introduced back-door qualifiers and defeated Wicklow, Armagh and Cork to reach the quarter-finals. They gained revenge over Roscommon with 0‚Äì14 to 1‚Äì05 victory to reach the semi-finals, where they defeated Derry by 3 points. In the final, they outclassed a Meath team by 0‚Äì17 to 0‚Äì08. Donnellan went on to win an All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship with his adopted club Salthill-Knocknacarra in 2005. He gave a man of the match performance in the final where Salthill narrowly edged out Antrim club St. Galls. After being hampered by injury in recent years, Donnellan pulled the curtain down on a career at the end of the 2006 season, a career during which he won nearly ever honour in the game. In May 2020, the Irish Independent named Donnellan as one of the \\"dozens of brilliant players\\" who narrowly missed selection for its \\"Top 20 footballers in Ireland over the past 50 years\\". League of Ireland In December 1999 Donnellan signed for Don O'Riordan at Galway United for the rest of the 1999-2000 League of Ireland season.

He was born in Peddapuram in the East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh in India in 1915 to parents Parabrahma Murthy and Lakshmi. His early schooling was in Peddapuram and Rajahmundry. For his higher education he moved to Visakhapatnam to study at the Andhra University. Education Prof. B. S. Rao, the name by which he is well known, did his B.A.(Hons.)/M.A. economics degree in Andhra University during 1935‚Äì39. He graduated with honors with a first rank. Prof. B. S. Rao began his career at the Andhra University as a researcher and then became a faculty member, a tutor, on the same campus working for Dr. V.S. Krishna who later became his mentor. During the years 1950‚Äì53, Prof. B. S. Rao traveled to England (as British Council Scholar) where he worked on the subject of India's balance of payments under the guidance of Austin Robinson, in Cambridge University for his doctoral degree. Prof. B. S. Rao earned his doctorate in economics in 1953 and returned to his alma mater. Prof. B. S. Rao was made Head of the Department of Economics at Andhra University, soon after his return from England. He led the department of economics as a Head until his retirement in 1975.

The AERC flourished under his guidance and the reports brought out by the centre were adjudged the best in the country. During the early stages of the University he was also instrumental in starting and sustaining academic activity in most of the social science departments at AU. He was a member of the Andhra Pradesh state planning board for several years. Andhra University and Nagarjuna University have both awarded the Honorary degree D. Litt. His contributions outside the India, though for short spans of time, were equally rewarding to the countries and institutions he served. He worked in 1964 as a senior general economist at the UN Asian Institute for Economic Development and Planning at Bangkok and as economic adviser to the Government of East Nigeria for two years, at the instance of the Ministry of External Affairs. Retirement After his retirement in 1975, Prof. B. S. Rao continued as an Emeritus Professor until 1979.

He was the president of the Gayatri Vidya Parishad since 1989 providing value- based and quality education in the City of Destiny (Visakhapatnam). His contributions to both inter-disciplinary and action research have helped agencies like Bhagavathula Charitable Trust, Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation, Visakhapatnam Urban Development Authority and the district administration to get correct inputs at the right time to resolve crucial problems such as slums, illiteracy, and urban pollution. One of his several well accomplished students, Dr. K. C. Reddy wrote in The Hindu in 2003 about Prof. Rao, \\"A Gandhian and a liberal in economic philosophy and institution management, he is a rare combination of tradition and modernity in both thought and action. His intellectual inspiration drawn from Dr. Krishna, combined with a legacy of institution building he inherited from his teacher, V.K.R.V. Rao, ably supported by the multi-disciplinary approach that he has cultivated through a very deep intellectual association with MIDS and in particular with Malcom Adiseshaiah made Prof. Sarveswara Rao not only an outstanding economist but a social scientist of extreme concern for contemporary society and people.\\" References Category:20th-century Indian economists Category:Andhra University alumni Category:1915 births Category:2010 deaths ","title":"Bhavaraju Sarveswara Rao"},{"id":"8024445","text":"Colonial Records was a record label located in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The records were distributed by ABC-Paramount Records from 1956 until May, 1959 when it was distributed by London Records. Tollie Records became the label's final distributor toward the end of Colonial's existence. The label was owned by Orville Campbell, a University of North Carolina Graduate and editor of the local newspaper. Some of Colonial Records artist were Andy Griffith, Bill Craddock, Johnny Dee, and George Hamilton IV. One album, Crash's Greatest Hits by Bill Craddock, was released on the label in 1986,although the label ceased to release new product on a large scale after 1965.This record label is now defunct. Colonial Records was founded in 1951 off of royalty proceeds from a song called \\"All The Way Choo Choo\\" written by Orville Campbell and a partner in 1949 about UNC football star Charlie Justice. The tune was recorded by Johnny Long and his Orchestra and was released on King records, becoming regionally popular especially in North Carolina. Early Colonial releases dabbled in various genres including novelty, popular and bluegrass music. The label had several large hits. One of the biggest comedy records of all time, and the first release by Andy Griffith, titled \\"What It Was, Was Football\\", was first released by the label in 1953. Because the label was too small to handle the success of the record, it sold the master to Capitol, gaining the label enough income to more seriously pursue the record business. Another hit that the label had major success with was \\"A Rose and a Baby Ruth\\", by George Hamilton IV. The label sold about 50,000 copies of the record, and in October 1956, sold the rights to ABC- Paramount. ABC Paramount then sold nearly one million copies of the record. Some other successful Colonial releases include \\"Sittin' In The Balcony\\" by Johnny Dee. It was released in 1957 as John D. Loudermilk's first solo release and reached #38 on the Billboard charts that year. It could have possibly reached higher except that newcomer Eddie Cochran's cover version of the song on the more established Liberty label won out in the competition reaching #18. Doug Franklin and the Bluenotes recording of \\"Lucky Love\\" made a good showing in 1958 placing in the Hot 100 at #73. Although not placing in the charts, \\"Ski King\\" by E.C.

Its mission is to preserve and share the history and archaeology of Lake Champlain. As a maritime museum specializing in archaeology, LCMM studies the hundreds of shipwrecks discovered in Lake Champlain and plays a major role in the management of those cultural resources. Through the preservation and interpretation of those and other artifacts, the museum tells the story of the people and culture of the Lake Champlain region.  History  Founded in 1985, the museum took up residence in an old stone schoolhouse on the grounds of the Basin Harbor Club, a private resort situated on the lake's shoreline, and opened to the public in 1986. Since then, LCMM has grown to include 18 buildings at two sites housing collections and exhibits, a boat shop and small shipyard, blacksmith facilities, an archaeological conservation laboratory, museum store, offices, and lecture space. A major physical expansion occurred in 2001 when the Burlington Shipyard was opened in the city of Burlington, Vermont, some 20 miles north of LCMM's main campus. The following year the museum acquired the Capt. White Place, a c.1815 ship captain's home in Burlington, and in 2004 moved its Burlington offices and exhibits from the shipyard into the Lyman Building, a city-owned facility on the Burlington waterfront. In June 2017 the museum announced a five phase $44 million plan to raise and preserve the Spitfire, a gunboat that was sunk in the Battle of Valcour Island.Ring, Wilson. Vermont museum to raise Revolutionary War gunboat from lake bottom. Savannah Morning News June 4, 2017. Accessed June 5, 2017  Programming  In addition to underwater archaeological research and traditional gallery-style exhibits, LCMM conducts educational, boatbuilding, and boating programs, and hosts lectures, annual juried photography shows, and historical re-enactment events. An active education department offers classes ranging from on-water exploration to traditional crafts, and staff educators conduct wintertime outreach to area schools, visiting students in their classrooms and helping them learn about the American Revolutionary War, 19th century maritime commerce, and Lake Champlain's archaeological resources. Each winter, area youth organizations partner with the museum to build either a Cornish pilot gig or a Whitehall pulling boat. This program is intended to help teenage students learn important life skills and develop an improved self-image through the collaborative building process.Granstrom, Chris, \\"Kids, Trees, and a Boat that Floats\\", Northern Woodlands, Summer, 2001 Those boats are then used in classes and community rowing programs during the boating season.  Replica fleet  A significant part of the museum's effort to understand the region's maritime past is its fleet of replica vessels. Historians and archaeologists at the museum believe that the recreation of historic vessel types offers a unique understanding of the vessels, their crews, and the society of a given era while allowing the public to experience history in a very tangible way.Garrity, Patrick (June 27, 2004),\\"Building History\\", Burlington Free Press, p.2D The smallest of these, and the first replica built at the museum, is the Perseverance, a boat of a type used during the French & Indian War, known as a Bateau. The successful completion of that project in 1986 encouraged the museum and its supporters to build a replica of a revolutionary war gunboat, the Philadelphia II.Cohn, Arthur B.(2003). Lake Champlain's Sailing Canal Boats. Lake Champlain Maritime Museum. p.104 Launched in 1991, that vessel serves today as a focal point for interpreting the British and American campaigns on the Lake in 1776, and is an accurate reproduction of the original vessel which was sunk in combat at the Battle of Valcour Island. It was raised from lake's bottom in 1935 and is currently preserved at the Smithsonian Institution. The flagship of the LCMM fleet is the canal schooner Lois McClure. The product of a partnership between the museum and the Lake Champlain Transportation Company, this 88-foot replica was launched in July 2004 after three years of construction in Burlington. Its design is based on the General Butler, a schooner wrecked in Burlington Harbor on December 9, 1876, and the O.J. Walker, another sailing canal boat which sank in 1895.Cohn, Arthur B.(2003). Lake Champlain's Sailing Canal Boats. Lake Champlain Maritime Museum. pp. 118‚Äì123  Events  In 2005 the Lois McClure toured the lake and the Hudson River, bringing the story of sailing canal boats and the so-called Northern Waterway to residents of the Hudson Valley and New York City. A similar tour was carried out in 2007 on the New York State Barge Canal, the present-day incarnation of the Erie Canal. Visitors were free to board and explore the vessel for no charge and talk to crewmembers about the boat and the history of the waterway. Some of the museum's regular annual special events are rowing competitions that are held in the spring and fall, and the Rabble In Arms living history weekend. On that weekend historical re-enactors gather on the museum grounds to bring to life a significant event from the lake's past, and each year a different event is chosen. There is also an annual small boat show, and exhibits of photos taken by both amateur and professional photographers from around the region.

The Court held that foreign non-monetary judgments may be enforced in Canada where they have been rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, the rendering is final, and the nature of the judgment is such that comity requires it to be enforced. Background Pro Swing is an American company that sells golf equipment under the \\"trident\\" trade-mark. Elta Golf is an Ontario company that sells golf equipment that includes products with a trade-mark similar to that of the \\"trident\\". Pro Swing sued for trade-mark infringement in Ohio. A settlement was reached which ordered Elta Golf to refrain from selling any products with the trident logo. In 2002, Pro Swing filed to an Ohio court for contempt of court for Elta's breach of the settlement. The court granted the order. Pro Swing then filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice for enforcement of the order. The motions judge found that the non-monetary order was valid, but found certain parts duplicative and had them severed from the order. On appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario, the court found the order was unenforceable due to ambiguity in the order regarding its scope of application. Opinion of the Court Justice Deschamps wrote the majority opinion. She ordered the appeal dismissed. The old rule for foreign judgments required that they be final, conclusive, and for a monetary amount. Deschamps found this rule to be outdated and stated that a new rule for non-monetary orders based on comity was needed. She proposed that non-monetary judgments should be enforced when # judgment is rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction # the judgment is final # the nature of the judgment is such that comity requires enforcements. On the current facts she found the order unenforceable. The contempt order is quasi-criminal which should never be enforced. This public law element eclipses any other private law element. She further advised in obiter that courts should ensure there will be no conflict once the order is rendered, and should not allow punishments that are not available under the foreign jurisdiction. Dissent McLachlin, in dissent, argued that incremental change was a preferable approach. The standard should be based on comity, order, and fairness. When assessing an application, the court should not look at the judgment's merits. The only restrictions upon enforcement of foreign non-monetary judgments should be: # issue court does not have jurisdiction # where non-monetary orders are not final or clear # where the order is criminal in nature See also * List of Supreme Court of Canada cases External links * Category:Conflict of laws case law Category:Supreme Court of Canada cases Category:2006 in Canadian case law ","title":"Pro Swing Inc v Elta Golf Inc"},{"id":"8024573","text":"Woolgoolga is a town on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales, Australia. It is on the Pacific Highway, approximately 550 km north of Sydney and 365 km south of Brisbane. The closest city to Woolgoolga is Coffs Harbour, which lies 25.8 km to the south. Woolgoolga has two beaches on the Pacific Ocean. The area has long been a centre of banana growing in New South Wales, but this industry has declined in the face of competition from Queensland. Recent times have seen many banana plantations replaced by blueberries after banana sales slumped in the late 1990s. Timbergetting and sawmilling was established in 1883. A government jetty was constructed in 1892 upon which tramways were laid. These led to sawmills in the town which in turn were connected by light railway to the Jesse Simpson Range forest areas. The jetty was demolished over a prolonged period from 1952 to 1956.Longworth, Jim. \\"The Jetty and Sawmill Tramways of Woolgoolga\\", Australian Railway History, February 2007, pp.58-76  Demographics  Woolgoolga had a population of 5,290 people in 2016, including 229 indigenous persons and 3,662 Australian-born persons. The median age of all persons is 45 years. Notably, from the Census data, 804 persons (15%) speak Punjabi at home, 661 persons practise Sikhism and 666 persons (13%) were of Indian descent.  History  Permanent European settlement occurred in the 1870s when the Hofmeier family moved to the area to make their selections. Prior to this, the area was inhabited by the Gumbaynggirr Aboriginal people. The name of the town derives from the word \\"Wiilgulga\\", which was used by the local Aboriginal people to describe the area, and the Black Apple trees that grew there. The name \\"Woogoolga\\" was gazetted in 1888, and changed to the current name of Woolgoolga in 1966. Woolgoolga was an early centre of Sikh migration to Australia. Sikhs had migrated to New South Wales and Queensland prior to the imposition of the prohibition of non-European migration under the White Australia Policy in 1901 and many of them then led a marginalised life on the north coast of New South Wales and in southeastern Queensland. Some Sikhs began to settle in Woolgoolga during World War II, because war-time labour shortages led to a relaxation of the previous prohibition of non-European labour in the banana industry. After the war they were able to acquire leasehold and freehold banana plantations. Woolgoolga has the largest regional Sikh/Punjabi population in Australia, and they are now said to own 90% of the banana farms and are also diversifying into blueberries.  Tourism  Woolgoolga's main beach Woolgoolga's coastal location and temperate climate make it a popular tourist destination. The town is bypassed by the Pacific Highway and many travellers break their journey in Woolgoolga. The Sydney 2000 Olympics torch relay passed through Woolgoolga, as did the 2006 Commonwealth Games Queen's Baton Relay. In 2011, the area hosted Rally Australia, the 10th round of the World Rally Championship. It hosted stages 22 and 25 at Plum Pudding.  Temples  Woolgoolga has two complete Gurdwaras (temples): *The First Sikh Temple Woolgoolga (the first purpose built Gurdwara in Australia) *Guru Nanak Sikh Temple / Gurdwara ('The Temple on the Hill') As well as those there is another being constructed next to the First Sikh Temple.  Curryfest  Curryfest is the largest single gathering for the Woolgoolga community. Curryfest was inaugurated in 2006 (with the help of local celebrity Jack Thompson), to celebrate the culture of the local Sikh community. The festival was originally run by the Woolgoolga Chamber of Commerce. This occurred in the initial two years of 2007 and 2008, however the festival became incorporated into its own identity for 2009. The event still uses the name and backing of the Chamber of Commerce but now partially pays for the event itself, including through the introduction of a two dollar entry fee in 2009.Star FM 105.5 interview 9 April 2009  Food and wine  Woolgoolga has a pub and a number of cafes and restaurants. The Seaview Tavern (corner of Clarence and River Streets), also known as The Fountain on the Mountain, is the only pub. There is usually live music on Friday and Saturday nights and a function room upstairs where larger gigs take place. Bluebottles (corner of Beach Street and Lake Road) is one of the many cafes. It serves as a more upmarket establishment for lunch and dinner. Thursday night is jazz night with live jazz music played throughout the evening. Other cafes are Taffys, Audrey G's, Ground Earth, and The Beach House. Restaurants include The Spice Rack, Thai Chai Yo Thai, Singhan Da Dhaba Indian and The Box Factory Burgers. There are two pizza restaurants in Woolgoolga: Woolgoolga Pizza Place and Riptide Pizzeria.

The wing is also the \\"host unit\\" at Ellsworth AFB. The wing is one of only two B-1B Lancer strategic bomber wings in the United States Air Force, the other being the 7th Bomb Wing at Dyess Air Force Base, Texas. Active for over 60 years, the 28th was a component wing of Strategic Air Command's deterrent force throughout the Cold War. The 28th Bomb Wing has been commanded by Colonel David Doss since July 2019. The previous commander was Colonel Gentry Boswell from 2015‚Äì2017 and Col Edwards from 2017-2019; its Command Chief Master Sergeant is CMSgt Adam Vizi.

The 28th Bomb Wing carries on the traditions of the 28th Operations Group. Myth: The motto \\"Guardian of the North\\" is not related in any way to the wing's Cold War service with Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bombers. Although this motto seems to dovetail nicely with the idea of guarding the north (whether spearheading an attack over the North Pole, or defending against one) from the Soviets, this is definitely not the case. History : For related history and lineage, see 28th Operations Group The 28th Bomb Wing, under various designations, has been assigned to Ellsworth Air Force Base, South Dakota for over 60 years. It is the longest assigned active-duty unit at a single base in the United States Air Force. =Cold War= Cold War Emblem of the 28th Bombardment Wing 28th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing Convair RB-36D Peacemaker, AF Ser. No. 49-2688, with Tail Code Triangle-S, circa 1951 Established as the 28th Bombardment Wing, Very Heavy on 28 July 1947, the wing maintained proficiency in heavy bombardment from 1947 to 1948 and maintained proficiency in global bombardment, deploying tactical components or segments thereof as needed from 1948 to 1950. In March 1953, an RB-36 and its entire crew of 23 crashed in Newfoundland while returning from a routine exercise in Europe. On 13 June 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower made a personal visit to dedicate the base in memory of Brig Gen Richard E. Ellsworth, commander of the 28th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing, who lost his life in that mishap. Although the wing's aerial reconnaissance capability lasted until September 1958, by April 1955 the Air Force had already changed the wing back to its former status as the 28th Bombardment Wing, Heavy, under the 15th Air Force (later attached to the 3rd Air Division), which specialized almost exclusively in nuclear ordnance delivery. Headquarters Strategic Air Command (SAC) reassigned the 28 BMW from 8th Air Force back to 15th Air Force in October 1955. The wing also completed a deployment to Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, from April 1955 to July 1955. Approximately one year later, SAC set plans in motion to replace the 28th's Convair B-36 Peacemakers with the new all-jet B-52 Stratofortress. The last B-36 left Ellsworth on 29 May 1957 and the first B-52 arrived sixteen days later. In 1958, all base units came under the command of the 821st Strategic Aerospace Division, headquartered at Ellsworth. On 26 September 1958, two B-52Ds from the wing set world speed records for heavy aircraft. One flew a 5,000 km closed course at an average speed of 597.695 mph, while the other flew a 10,000 km closed course at a speed of 560.705 mph. The wing added aerial refueling to its mission in 1959 with the addition of the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker and also began operating post- attack command and control system for Fifteenth Air Force in January 1965, maintaining this capability through a rear echelon during the absences of the remainder of the wing. The wing also temporarily controlled the 850th Strategic Missile Squadron, a non-equipped Titan I missile squadron from December 1960 to December 1961 pending the later establishment of the 44th Strategic Missile Wing at Ellsworth. In April 1966, B-52Ds of the wing, together with D series bombers of the 484th Bombardment Wing deployed to Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, replacing the B-52Fs that SAC had been deploying to Andersen for the Vietnam War since the previous year. The 28th's planes and other B-52Ds had been modified under a program called Big Belly, which increased the bombload of wing aircraft to 84 500 lb bombs or 42 750 lb bombs, from the 27 it could previously carry. From this point, the Big Belly B-52D became the SAC workhorse in Southeast Asia. 28th BMW B-52H circa 1979 Except for a small rear echelon left at Ellsworth, the wing's headquarters staff, aircraft and crews, and most support personnel were integrated into Operation Arc Light forces for combat in Southeast Asia, c. 9 March ‚Äì c. 21 September 1966, c. 15 January ‚Äì c. 19 July 1968, and c. 9 September 1969 ‚Äì c. 18 March 1970. From April 1972 to October 1973 the wing also had most of its tactical aircraft and crews on loan to SAC organizations involved in combat operations, and the wing continued supporting Pacific forces with planes and crews into 1975. In 1971, the wing converted from the B-52D to the B-52G, and converted again from B-52G to B-52H models in 1977. The B-52H mission expanded in 1984 to include sea reconnaissance, surveillance, and conventional operations from forward bases overseas, to include employment of the AGM-84 Harpoon missile. The wing also upgraded its tanker force to KC-135R variant in 1985 and 1986. 4th ACCS EC-135G Airborne Launch Control Center at Ellsworth AFB, SD 4th ACCS patch EC-135A Airborne Launch Control Center Airborne Launch Control System crew member From 1 April 1970 to 30 September 1992, the 4th Airborne Command and Control Squadron (ACCS), part of the 28th BMW, provided airborne command post responsibilities with specially modified Boeing EC-135 airborne command post aircraft for Strategic Air Command as part of the Post Attack Command and Control System. The 4th ACCS was the workhorse of Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS) operations. Three dedicated Airborne Launch Control Centers (ALCC) (pronounced \\"Al-see\\"), designated ALCC No. 1, ALCC No. 2, and ALCC No. 3 were on ground alert around-the-clock providing ALCS coverage for five of the six Minuteman Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Wings. These dedicated ALCCs were mostly EC-135A aircraft but sometimes were EC-135C or EC-135G aircraft, depending on availability. ALCC No. 1 was on ground alert at Ellsworth AFB, SD and during a wartime scenario, its role would have been to take off and orbit between the Minuteman Wings at Ellsworth AFB, SD and F.E. Warren AFB, WY, providing ALCS assistance if needed. ALCCs No. 2 and No. 3 were routinely on forward deployed ground alert at Minot AFB, ND. During a wartime scenario, ALCC No. 3‚Äôs role would have been to take off and orbit between the Minuteman ICBM Wings at Minot AFB, ND and Grand Forks AFB, ND, providing ALCS assistance if needed. ALCC No. 2‚Äôs dedicated role was to take off and orbit near the Minuteman ICBM Wing at Malmstrom AFB, MT, providing ALCS assistance if needed. The 4th ACCS also maintained an EC-135C or EC-135G on ground alert at Ellsworth as the West Auxiliary Airborne Command Post (WESTAUXCP), which was a backup to SAC‚Äôs Looking Glass Airborne Command Post (ABNCP), as well as a radio relay link between the Looking Glass and ALCCs when airborne. Although equipped with ALCS, the WESTAUXCP did not have a dedicated Minuteman ICBM wing to provide ALCS assistance to.ALCS Article, page 14[Hopkins III, Robert S. 1997. Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker: More Than Just a Tanker. Leicester, England: Midland Publishing Limited, p. 114-117, 196]4th ACCS History Article, p.1 In 1986, the 28 BMW made extensive preparations to phase out the aging B-52 fleet and become the new home for the advanced B-1 Lancer. Contractors completed new unaccompanied enlisted dormitories in March, a new security police group headquarters in October, and gave Ellsworth's 13,497-foot runway a much-needed facelift. In addition, they completed new aircraft maintenance facilities for the complex new B-1B. In January 1987, the wing received the first of 35 B-1B bombers. The 37 BS returned to operational duty with the 28 BW in January 1987, just in time to join the 77 BS in training on the new bombers. The first B-1B arrived on 21 January 1987. In July 1988 the 57th Air Division became the wing's new higher headquarters. In 1989 the wing's B-1Bs earned the Fairchild Trophy, Crumm Linebacker Trophy, Eaker Trophy, and the Omaha Trophy for superior bomber operations and the most outstanding wing in SAC. The wing also provided tanker support for Operation Just Cause, December 1989 ‚Äì January 1990. In July 1990 the Strategic Warfare Center became the latest of the wing's intermediate headquarters. Adding to its extensive combat experience, the wing deployed both tanker and airborne command post aircraft to Operation's Desert Shield/Desert Stormfrom August 1990 ‚Äì March 1991. On 1 September 1991 SAC redesignated the 28th as the 28th Wing, and once again assigned it directly under Eighth Air Force, and as part of the new objective wing organization, reactivated the old 28 BG under the new name of the 28th Operations Group. The 28th Wing also regained host wing responsibilities for Ellsworth from the 44th Missile Wing. =Post Cold War era= Emblem of the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing Emblem of the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing (Desert Motif) With the end of the Cold War, on 28 September 1991 the Secretary of Defense ordered B-1Bs and tankers off alert. The 4 ACCS continued to maintain an alert crew until May 1992. On 1 June 1992, simultaneously, SAC inactivated, Air Combat Command activated, the 28th Wing changed names to the 28th Bomb Wing, and the 28 AREFS became a geographically separated unit assigned to Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana. In September 1992 the 4 ACCS also inactivated, having effectively worked themselves out of a job by providing airborne command and control so faithfully for so long. In 1993 the wing's B-1Bs were the first in ACC to transition from their former strategic role to an all-conventional mission. The 28th's operational squadrons could conceivably touch anywhere in the world to meet national defense needs. Ellsworth tested this concept in 1993 and early 1994 during such events as: \\"Team Spirit\\" (the first B-1Bs ever to land in South Korea); \\"Global Power\\" (various long-duration, round trip sorties flown from Ellsworth to bomb training ranges in another continent.); and \\"Bright Star\\" (the wing's second but the B-1Bs first visit to a major JCS exercise in Southwest Asia). From June through December 1994, 28 BW B-1Bs participated in a Congressionally directed operational readiness assessment known locally as \\"Dakota Challenge.\\" Towards the end of the exercise the wing deployed a squadron to Roswell, NM, to simulate flying from an austere location at wartime sortie rates. This test proved the B-1B to be a versatile weapon system. Excellent results were obtained. However, World Airpower Journal argued that '[i]t could be argued that the excellent results were meaningless, because they were so unrepresentative. Spare parts, equipment and people were brought in from the 7th and 384th Bomb Wings, at last bringing up the 28th up to 100% in all three respects. This was done at the expense of degrading the other two wings. It did however show what was possible, given funding and commitment.'.World Air Power Journal, Vol 24, Spring 1996, p.101 The journal favorably quoted General John M. Loh in this regard. On 31 March 1995, the 77 BS‚Äîa unit that had served under the wing since 1948‚Äîinactivated. Its B-1Bs became part of ACC's reconstitution reserve. This action freed funds to allow the Air Force to develop new precision-guided munitions. The Air Force announced in early 1996 that the 77 BS would once again activate under the 28 BW on 1 April 1997. In November 1998, they received the first Block D upgraded B-1B in the USAF inventory. The Block D upgrade brings the capability for the B-1 to drop the Joint Direct Attack Munition, which is a global positioning system (GPS) guided munition. (These are the upgrades that were paid for with the funds that were freed during the 77 BS's inactivation). One B-1B from the 28th Bomb Wing departed for Southwest Asia 18 December 1997 to supply additional bomber forces in the Middle East. The 7th Bomb Wing at Dyess Air Force Base also launched a B-1B 18 December. This brings the total number of B-1Bs in theater to six‚Äîthree from Ellsworth and three from Dyess. B-1Bs from both bases saw their first combat action in air raids over Iraq 17 December 1997. Details on the number of B-1Bs used and battle damage assessment information has not been released; however, the missions were characterized as \\"very successful.\\" In December 1998, 28th deployed aircraft, which flew under the flag of the 28th Air Expeditionary Group in Operation Desert Fox, were the first B-1s to drop bombs on an enemy target. In late March 2011, B-1 bombers from the 28th Bomb Wing were deployed on a mission to Libya to attack military targets in support of Operation Odyssey Dawn. The Department of the Air Force announced in the spring of 2015 that effective 1 October 2015 the 28th, along with the 7th Bomb Wing at Dyess Air Force Base would be realigned under Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC), reuniting all the Air Force's bomber and strategic missiles under a single command for the first time since Strategic Air Command was disestablished 23 years earlier. = Operations and Decorations= * Combat Operations: Except for a small rear echelon left at Ellsworth AFB, SD, the wing's headquarters staff, tactical aircraft and crews, and most support personnel were integrated into ARC LIGHT forces for combat in Southeast Asia, c. 9 March-c. 21 September 1966, c. 15 January-c. 19 July 1968, and c. 9 September 1969-c. 18 March 1970. From Apr 1972 to Oct 1973 the wing also had most of its tactical aircraft and crews on loan to SAC organizations involved in combat operations, and the wing continued supporting Pacific forces with planes and crews into 1975. In Nov 1997, deployed four B-1s and crews to Southwest Asia for a show of force against Iraq, the first real-world contingency use of the B-1 bomber. A year later (Nov 1998), the wing deployed three B-1s and crews to Southwest Asia for punitive attacks against Iraqi targets, the first combat use of the B-1. After terrorist attacks against the United States in Sep 2001, the wing deployed B-1 aircraft and crews to Diego Garcia, an island in the Indian Ocean, for bombing missions against enemy targets in Afghanistan. * Campaigns: None * Decorations: Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards with Combat \\"V\\" Device: 1 June 2001 ‚Äì 31 May 2003; 20 September 2001 ‚Äì 17 January 2002 (conferred).

Highway 11 is a major north-south highway in Saskatchewan, Canada that connects the province's three largest cities: Regina, Saskatoon and Prince Albert. It is a structural pavement major arterial highway which is approximately long. It is also known as the Louis Riel Trail (LRT) after the 19th century M√©tis leader. It runs from Highway 1 (Trans-Canada Highway) in Regina until Highway 2 south of Prince Albert. Historically the southern portion between Regina and Saskatoon was Provincial Highway 11, and followed the Dominion Survey lines on the square, and the northern portion between Saskatoon and Prince Albert was Provincial Highway 12. From Regina to Saskatoon, Highway 11 is a four-lane divided highway except in the village of Chamberlain, where the road narrows to two lanes through the community, including its intersection with Highway 2 south to Moose Jaw. All intersections in this segment are at-grade except for two interchanges in the Lumsden valley and in Saskatoon. Highway 11 passes through Saskatoon, following Circle Drive, bypassing the downtown area with the completion of the southern leg of the freeway in 2015. North of Saskatoon, the road continues as a four-lane divided highway past the communities of Warman, Osler, Hague, Rosthern and Duck Lake. Highway 11 then runs through the Nisbet Provincial Forest and past the hamlet of MacDowall before it reaches its northern terminus with Highway 2 approximately south of Prince Albert.

Besides being the provincial capital, Regina is a cultural and commercial metropole for both southern Saskatchewan and adjacent areas in the neighbouring American states of North Dakota and Montana. Hwy 11 begins in a moist mixed grassland region known as the Regina Plain ecoregion. Evraz Regina, a North American steel company formerly known as IPSCO, is located in the Sherwood Industrial Park (SIP) north of Regina. The final chapter for the namesake of the Louis Riel Trail occurred in Regina. It was here that M√©tis leader Louis Riel was tried and hung on September 18, 1885 for treason. In the spring of 2008, Tourism, Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Christine Tell proclaimed in Duck Lake, that \\"the 125th commemoration, in 2010, of the 1885 Northwest Resistance is an excellent opportunity to tell the story of the prairie M√©tis and First Nations peoples' struggle with Government forces and how it has shaped Canada today.\\" The length of the route is an asphalt concrete primary weight highway which is part of the national highway system (NHS) The Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure (SHS) South Central Planning Committee manages the construction and maintenance of the highway near Regina which handles approximately 11,000 vehicles per day (VPD) in the Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) count. Highway 11 begins just southwest of Regina in the Rural Municipality of Sherwood No. 159, where the Regina Bypass meets the Trans-Canada Highway, and travels north along Regina's western boundary, briefly passing through Regina city limits. Prior to the completion of the Regina Bypass in October 2019, Highway 11 began at the junction of Victoria Avenue and Ring Road in the east end of the city, and shared a concurrency with Highway 6, before branching northwest from Albert Street at Regina's northern boundary, passing Pasqua Street. As part of the Regina Bypass, the Highway 11 designation was moved to the new freeway, while the bypassed section of Highway 11 between Highway 6 (Albert Street) and the Regina Byass was redesignated as Highway 11A. =Lumsden No. 189= Adopt A Highway Road Sign Hwy 11 branches to the northwest from the Regina Bypass outside the city limits and then passes the junction of Hwy 734. A steep decline begins into the Qu'Appelle Valley meeting Hwy 20 and Lumsden at the lowest depression the bridge over the Qu'Appelle River. The village of Lumsden was created in 1890 in conjunction with the coming of the CNR. When Saskatchewan became a province the Local Improvement District was formed, becoming the Rural Municipality of Lumsden No. 189 in 1912. One of the many administrative concerns of the RM was road construction and maintenance. The Qu'Appelle Valley provides a scenic route as the LRT traverses the Qu'Appelle River. Lumsden Historical Museum, The town of Lumsden, located on the Qu'Appelle River is at the bottom of the valley. The AADT within the valley declines to over 7,000 VPD after Lumsden. The northern hill out of the Qu'appelle Valley meets the intersection of Hwy 54, which provides access to Regina Beach on Long Lake.(Last Mountain Lake). The Arm River Plain is well- suited to agricultural venture and doyote, red fox, and jack rabbit may be spotted. There are archaeological sites along the Arm River Valley including a bison kill site and also in this area Bigmouth Buffalo (Ictiobus cyprinellus) along with varieties of sedge are flora of special concern. The SHS Central Planning Transportation Committee manages the route from here to just south of Saskatoon. =Dufferin No. 190= Highway 11, Qu'Appelle Valley The LRT continues west for another before turning north west. The Hwy 642 intersection features the small hamlet of Bethune, Saskatchewan to the north and Hwy 354. A former picnic area north of Bethune closed in 2013 or 2014. In the Allan Hills is the village of Findlater with 49 residents on the south side of the LRT, and picnic site on the north. In is the northbound turnoff for Hwy 2 to Prince Albert. This commences the concurrency with Hwy 2 into the town of Chamberlain. =Sarnia No. 221= Chamberlain, a village of 108 residents is at the intersection of the LRT, Hwy 2 south to Moose Jaw, and Hwy 733. A Surveyor and Ox Cart created by Davidson welder, farmer and sculptor Don Wilkins was erected in Chamberlain. are two sculptures A large sculpture of the prairie flower Prairie Lilies is also erected at Chamberlain. Chamberlain 1 km North of Chamberlain is a picnic stop area on the west side of the highway and in another is an unincorporated area of Aylesbury. This hamlet commemorates the LRT history with an Ox and Red River Cart sculpture by Don Wilkins located southwest of the LRT near the town entrance. The Midlakes Community Coalition erected this statue in 1999. Near the highway turn off at Aylesbury is a cemetery located on a hill near Lake Alexander. The Piping Plover (Charadrius melodus circumcinctus) is an endangered species of this area. Residents are also enumerated in census Division No. 6. =Craik No. 222= Slippery When Frozen Road Sign Another is the intersection of the LRT with Hwy 732. Hwy 732 is a paved road which travels through the Iskwao Creek Valley. In is the intersection with Hwy 643 where Craik is nestled within the triangle made by these three highways, Hwy 643, Hwy 732 and Hwy 11. Craik & District Regional Park are located north east of Craik. The buffalo hunter with buffalo gun and Red River cart sculptures made by Don Wilkins, President of the LRT Association, are erected at Craik. \\"Red River Cart First used in the Red River area to bring in meat from the buffalo hunt, the Red River Cart was later used in freighting. Constructed entirely of wood and tied together with leather, these carts were extremely stable and would be drawn through mud and marsh, floated and carried loads of 500 to 1000 pounds.\\" The Craik Sustainable Living Project (CSLP) Eco-Centre and ‚Äúdugout house‚Äù a typical 19th century living quarters can be toured with Pelican Eco-Tours. The park features Arm Lake which is the reservoir created from damming the Squaw Valley Creek which used to run from the Qu'Appelle River in the Eyebrow Hills north east just south of Davidson. The Arm River Valley is visible north of Chamberlain and continues to run parallel to the LRT from Bethune to Craik. Craik and District Golf Course is a 9 hole green golf course 1/2 mile east of the LRT. Craik has been sponsoring development and education about ‚Äúecovillages‚Äù, sustainable housing development. =Arm River No. 252= Truck Weigh Scale 1.5 km - Next Left, Telephone - Road Signage In a distance of is the small village of Girvin at the Hwy 749 which features The Buffalo (and Red River Cart) sculpture, the first piece made by Don Wilkins and features the buffalo a vital part of the fur trading and M√©tis life in the 18th and 19th centuries. \\"Spirit of the Plain This work is intended as a symbolic tribute to those peoples, native and non-native, past and present, who have found harmony under the prairie sky and achieved a calm rhythm with the natural forces of this great land...\\" Davidson, a town of over 950 residents is the halfway point between Saskatoon and Regina. Ditto the giant coffee pot and coffee cup in Davidson were erected in 1996 offering hospitality and a cup of coffee at the halfway rest stop. Sign for the Arm River Rest Area.A rest area is usually located in a clump of trees and will generally have picnic tables, rest room or outhouse facilities, trash bins and parking area to provide a resting spot for highway travelers wishing to rest. Sometimes the rest area site will feature a scenic view or historic marker. The M√©tis Fiddler and Oxcart statue were erected at Davidson in tribute to the LRT designation and the history of the m√©tis. The Iskwao Creek begins at Davidson and winds south to the Qu'Appelle Valley west of Girvin and Craik. A large white house erected in 1904 by Wells family north of Davidson and can be seen from the LRT. Davidson Golf & Country Club is north of the town of Davidson on the LRT and provides 9-hole grass greens. Davidson Campground and Swimming Pool is located near the golf course. This area is a part of the Saskatoon‚ÄîBiggar Economic Region and the Mid Sask Rural Economic Development Authority (REDA). Between the Qu'appelle Valley and the town of Dundurn on either side of Davidson, the AADT is approximately 5,000 VPD. =Willner No. 253= Traveling another northwest is the junction with Allen Road, and following that is the intersection of Knob Hill Road. Townline Road which is south of Bladworth which is a village of 70 residents near the intersecting line between Willner and McCraney rural municipalities. Just north of Bladworth are the Black & Silver Lakes waterfowl nesting areas. The distance between Bladworth and Kenaston is . =McCraney No. 282= Bonnington Springs Campground is located at Kenaston. Kenaston was originally named Bonnington Springs and is located at the intersection with Hwy 15. Kenaston, with the logo Blizzard Capital of Saskatchewan, features a large sculpture of a Snowman built in 1983, but not visible from the highway. Between Kenaston and Hwy 764 intersection is a length of and the locality of Strong, now just a ghost town. Residents belong to SARM Division No. 5 and are enumerated in Census Division No. 11 which resulted in a population of about 250 Kenaston residents. =Rosedale No. 283= Maximum 70 Speed Limit Road Sign through Chamberlain Hanley, a town of over 450, is located at the intersection of Hwy 764. Hanley erected in 2000, a stone monument honoring its historic Opera House. At the intersection with Indi Road is a marker in commemoration of Indi Siding. To the west of the road is Indi Lake, and to the east, Theressa Lake which has now become a portion of Blackstrap Lake. It is between Indi siding and the intersection of Hwy 211. =Dundurn No. 314= Photo taken from Saskatchewan Highway 11, LRT traveling south from Saskatoon to Regina Blackstrap Provincial Park, Blackstrap Lake and Mountain are two man made features to the east of Route 11 near Dundurn, Saskatchewan. The 1971 Canada Winter Games were hosted at this venue which sported ski run and ski jump. Blackstrap Provincial Park can be accessed by turning west onto Hwy 211. Wilson Museum can be seen on the outskirts of the town of Dundurn from the LRT. Dundurn is a town of approximately 650 which is located at the intersection of Hwy 211 and the AADT is around 6,000 VPD. The Bone Gatherer and horse and cart statues are visible from the LRT at Dundurn. Vast quantities of buffalo bones were gathered across the prairie in the last years of the 19th century. The bones were shipped by rail to be made into fertilizer. The huge herds of buffalo roaming the prairie were a thing of the past. \\"Dundurn. Honoring the Past Striving for a bright future. Dundurn, located in the heartland of the great Northern Bison range was known to buffalo hunters as Round Prairie. Cree, M√©tis and Dakota Sioux chose the wooded hills of this historic land as a good place to stay. Cattle ranching was [sic] established here in 1886 and since then the growth and prosperity of our community has been, to a great extent, dependent on the agricultural sector. The horse drawn Red River car and Bone Picker are reminiscent of an era ending when the skeletal remains of approximately 2,000,000 buffalo were gathered in the vicinity of Dundurn and Hanley. The influx of homesteaders, beginning in 1903, marked a new chapter in our story of progress and continuity.\\" The Strehlow Road intersection marks the old access road to the locality of Strehlow as well Haultain Road which is the next junction marks the old access road to the locality of Haultain. The former Haultain one room school house site is now located on the Canadian Forces Base Dundurn grounds. LRT traveling south from Saskatoon to Regina Saskatchewan International Raceway is a drag racing venue located along the LRT, south of Saskatoon. Another along the LRT is the intersection with Floral Road to the east marking the birthplace town of Gordie Howe, and Grasswood Road on the west is at a small commercial area. Between Grasswood and Saskatoon the AADT increases to over 8,000 VPD, and the remainder of the route is within the jurisdiction of the SHS North Central Transportation Planning Committee. The Saskatoon Plain section of the moist mixed grassland of dark brown soils is suitable for cereal grains, feed grains and forage crops. =Corman Park No. 344= alt= Traveling through Saskatoon from Grasswood Road to the Hwy 16 turn off encompasses and entails going around Saskatoon on Circle Drive. Numerous attractions in Saskatoon, the largest city of Saskatchewan, include the Forestry Farm park and zoo, Remai Modern Art Gallery, and the Wanuskewin National Heritage Park. The cloverleaf interchange at Circle Drive in Saskatoon was one of the first two SK interchanges which opened in 1967. Highway 11 is signed in both directions around Circle Drive in Saskatoon. Continuing North, the highway passes several interchanges, including with 8th Street and College Drive/Hwy 5. After crossing the North Saskatchewan River, Circle Drive becomes a surface arterial commercial-industrial roadway for approximately 1.5 km. The Western route, after taking an exit on the cloverleaf, the highway passes the Idylwyd Freeway exit (its previous alignment through downtown) and Hwy 219, then crossing the North Saskatchewan River, and coming to an interchange with Highways 7 and 14. The stretch from 11th Street to Avenue C along the west/northwest area of Circle Drive has interchanges interspersed with Seagull intersections at Clancy Drive, Laurier Drive, and Airport Drive. The concurrency with the Yellowhead Highway begins at the diamond interchange with Idylwyld Drive in the north industrial. The end of this concurrency marks the beginning of the next concurrency with Hwy 12, before the LRT branches off from due north to a north-east direction of travel. At the intersection of Hwy 784, and the former alignment of Hwy 305 is the city of Warman with over 7,000 residents and the AADT is about 10,000 VPD. Turning west on Hwy 784 is the Clarkboro ferry route across the South Saskatchewan River. Approximately 2.4 km north of the former alignment is the new interchange for Hwy 305, providing access to north Warman. The town of Osler has 926 residents and is located at the intersection with Hwy 393. The AADT north of Warman to Osler declines to approximately 7,700 VPD. A vintage car on a pole is a large roadside attraction which can be seen at Osler. A further 1.6 kilometres (1 mile) north on the LRT is the intersection of Hwy 394 providing alternate access to the town. =Rosthern No. 403= The town of Hague with approximately 700 residents, is south of the intersection with Hwy 785. The town of Rosthern is situated at the next notable crossing, Hwy 312. Traffic has again declined with the greater distance from Saskatoon and Rosthern, with an average of 5,000 VPD between Osler and Hague, and about 4,500 VPD between Hague and Rosthern. Rosthern, a town of over 1300 people is located in the \\"valley of the converging branches of the North and South Saskatchewan Rivers.\\" The South Saskatchewan and North Saskatchewan River provide two important fish habitats for the province of Saskatchewan. There are 32 species of fish in the South Saskatchewan, and 25 species in the North Saskatchewan. The large roadside attraction of a wheat sheaf is located to the east of town at the tourism office and is visible from the LRT. The Station Arts center has converted the historic CN Station into an art gallery and summer theater center and is located at Rosthern. This section of the LRT travels through the Waldheim Plain of the Aspen parkland prairie ecoregion which features fescue grasslands dotted with Aspen tree bluffs. Black loamy soil types are excellent for specialty crops as well as grain and cereals which makes agriculture the predominant economic industry. Seager Wheeler's Maple Grove Farm, a National Historic Site, is located east of Rosthern by taking Hwy 312 from the LRT. Seager Wheeler (1868‚Äì1961) was a famous farmer developing hardy wheat varieties for the Saskatchewan short growing season. Pool Inland Terminal turn off between Saskatoon and Dundurn Divided highway segment Hwy 312 provides access to the Batoche National Historic Site which features the Caron house, St. Antoine de Padoue church and rectory. Batoche is where Louis Riel fought his final battles in the North-West Rebellion of 1885. The M√©tis adopted a river lot system for settlement near Batoche along the South Saskatchewan River. The coming of the surveyor marking the plains into square quarter sections disrupted the established way of life. The M√©tis were offered scrip between 1886 and 1902 as compensation for their loss of land. Scrip land entitlement comprised . The available lands were not along the original river valley, or near the original settlement, so many M√©tis sold their scrip for money. Fish Creek near Batoche was originally named Tourond's Coulee, Northwest Territories (NWT). The Battle of Fish Creek memorial is near Batoche, and St. Laurent de Grandin features the St. Laurent Shrine. The intersection of Hwy 312 is north of Hague by . =Duck Lake No. 463= Hwy 2 Hwy 11 junction Duck Lake is just south of the Hwy 212 intersection and Fort Carlton Provincial Historic Park is west of the LRT on Hwy 212. This historic fur trade center was also an integral part of the North West Resistance. Duck Lake along route 11 also re-tells the story of the North-West Rebellion in murals on town buildings. Duck Lake Regional Interpretive Center relates the history of first nations, M√©tis and an immigrant pioneer Society to the area. As well, Glen Scrimshaw Art Gallery provides a showing of local artist Glen Scrimshaw. After Duck Lake the average VPD again declines to just above 3,000 AADT. Traveling along the LRT is MacDowall which is west of the LRT. A part of the Boreal transition of the Boreal Plain is evident as the landscape changes to a mix of agricultural activities and forested areas. The black and dark gray soils are very fertile for a wide variety of crops. Along with aspen, white spruce, tamarack and jack pine are evident. Deer, moose, elk along with the occasional black bear can be seen along the route in this area. =Prince Albert No. 461= Junction of Highway 11 and Highway 2 on a nice summer day. It is another of travel in a north east direction to arrive at the terminus of the LRT, the intersection with Saskatchewan Highway 2 where the approximate AADT increases near the city of Prince Albert to 6,000 VPD. The final stretches of the LRT is in the boreal Nisbet Forest. Trails through the forest are enjoyed by snowmobilers, cross-country skiers, horseback riders, hikers, and campers History =Beginnings= Tourist Attractions - Science Centre IMAX, R.C.M.P. Museum, Royal Sask. Museum Road Signage at Regina Divided Highway segment The Qu‚ÄôAppelle, Long Lake and Saskatchewan Railway came through between Regina and Prince Albert through Saskatoon as early as 1890 providing an early method of travel following the red river cart and trail days. Chamberlain and Aylesbury were first linked via a highway in 1929, before this date transportation between the two was by a variety of trails. The summer of 1929 also started another road leaving the Qu'Appelle River valley east. Construction required building up low spots with elevating graders and dump wagons operated by horses. The elevating grader was to till unbroken soil and turn it towards a conveyor which lifted the dirt into the dump wagons. This process used 8 horses pulling in the front, and another eight at the rear pushing. The fresno crew constructed the level areas. Ditches were constructed on a 7% grade and filled with field rock to help prevent erosion. One of the main problems constructing the highway was the heavy field stone knolls. This highway served until 1949 when it was upgraded. Condie Hwy 734 junction \\"The upland collection area for the underground streams comes together on top of the valley near Chamberlain. Highway construction surveyors had to curve the right-of-way to avoid this area. Another interesting diversion that the highway surveyors had to make, at the insistence of local residents, was to go around a large stone that had a metal marker spike in it, likely set up and recorded by early explorers. This site is now marked on the LRT with a large silhouette buffalo statue made by Don Wilkins.\\" A large white house erected in 1904 by Wells family north of Davidson and can be seen from the LRT. The Wells family came north from Chicago and started The Wells Land & Cattle Co. becoming land agents for settlers from the agents. The Wells Land & Cattle Co. purchased land around Davidson, Arm River and Qu'Appelle River for homestead settlement. In 1971, the Department of Highways was moved from Hawarden to Kenaston closer to the main Highway, which was Hwy 11. Hanley erected in 2000, a stone monument honoring its historic Opera House. The 1924 Hanley Opera House was a center of cultural activity in the area. The Opera House featured Mary Pickford, Harry Lauder, Boris Karloff and the Chatauqua performers to name a few between its inception and 1967 when the new Centennial Hall was used for performances. The original Opera House was demolished in the 1980s as it was unsafe. Roads were provided and maintained through a committee formed in 1907 by Local Improvement District 15.B.3 around Hanley. The early challenges were the hilly area and creek to the east. Early prairie roads were trails which became so rutted that they could barely be crossed over. To make roads out of these trails horse drawn blade graders were used to level out hummocks and fill badger holes. Horse drawn slush scrapers filled in sloughs. More advanced fresno scrapers replaced the slush scrapers as they could make longer and wider swaths across the sloughs. By ploughing the prairie soil at the road allowance, and then using road graders to pull in the dirt roads could be made wide enough for the first cars of the area. The rural municipality of Rosedale No. 283 was incorporated December 13, 1909. Winter trails in the horse and buggy days would have two tracks across the prairie several feet higher than the prairie sod due to the snow built up on them. Summer raised roads were built up by using two horse scrapers digging an area alongside the highway, then using the loose dirt to widen the highway. Sixteen and twenty four horses were often needed to pull the graders, and several drivers were required. Any work done by a farmer would reduce his payment in taxes. The 1926 highway map of Saskatchewan marks the route of Provincial Highway 11 following along the CNR line using township and range roads, so travel is in lines straight north, changing direction to west travel at 90 degree angles from Regina through to Saskatoon. Only Provincial Highway 12 is marked in the same fashion between Saskatoon and Prince Albert on the 1926 highway map of Saskatchewan, which has formed the base of the northern section of the LRT. (The current Saskatchewan Highway 12 travels between Saskatoon and Shell Lake.) As tractors replaced horses in the field and motorized vehicles replaced horses on the road, an increasing need arose to replace the early dirt trails with graded gravel highways. In the early 1930s, the gravel highway constructed between Chamberlain and Aylesbury in 1929 was further extended to Dundurn to meet this need. Shortly thereafter, the graveled highway extended between Saskatoon and Regina. =Later history= As the Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) increased, the need for wider, all-weather, paved roads became increasingly apparent. As early as the 1930s, various Saskatchewan cities, towns, and rural municipalities lobbied the provincial government to develop hard surfaced roads, including Highway 11, to connect its major centers, particularly Regina, Saskatoon, Prince Albert and Moose Jaw. Saskatoon mayor R.M. Pinder argued that Highway 11 should receive priority because \\"it serves the greatest number of people for the longest period of time\\" and its hard surfacing would facilitate the travel of American tourists to Prince Albert National Park and support transport operations to and from the Dundurn Military Camp. A dispute flared up between Saskatoon and Prince Albert community organizations over whether Highway 11 or Highway 2 should be paved first. Prince Albert advocated prioritizing Highway 2 as a more direct route between the northern and southern parts of the province and a more attractive route for American tourists driving to Prince Albert National Park. Saskatoon preferred Highway 11 because the alternative would bypass it and not provide as many Saskatchewan residents the transportation benefits of direct access to a paved highway. In 1950, the provincial government indicated that it would prioritize the paving of Highway 11 between Saskatoon and Regina; by October 1952 this section was completely paved. The improved highway was also rerouted in some places, including the section between Bladworth and Dundurn which was completely rebuilt, and bypasses were built around some towns and villages through which it had formerly passed. Although the highway's route had not entirely reached its present contours, it was made straighter; the distance traversed between Saskatoon and Regina was reduced by 27 miles. It more closely followed the CNR tracks and contained fewer right angle corners than it had in 1926. The highway between Saskatoon and Prince Albert received less attention during this period; a 1956 highway map shows that it was still almost entirely gravel. Following the completion of the Trans Canada Highway, federal funds became available for provincial highway projects. Highway 11 was considered an important transportation route from a national perspective, and therefore received funding under the National Highways Project. The highway between Saskatoon and Rosthern was partially paved and the remainder was oiled to create a dust-free all-weather surface, and in 1964, the last remaining gravel section of the highway, between Rosthern and its junction with Highway 2, was oiled. In the latter half of the 1960s, many sections of the highway between Regina and Saskatoon were reconstructed and given wide shoulders; previously some segments had no shoulders. During the same period, the Saskatoon to Prince Albert portion was rebuilt to \\"Trans-Canada standards\\" and extensively re-routed to follow the same course as the CNR tracks which shortened the travel distance between the two cities by 13 miles. A new route was constructed to connect Saskatoon and Rosthern via Warman and Hague. Once this phase of construction was complete, the Rosthern to Prince Albert segment was upgraded and fully paved, and the segment between MacDowall and Prince Albert was re-routed along a straighter course. In 1960, the section between Regina and Lumsden was the first to be converted to a four lane twinned highway. Twinning the rest of highway between Saskatoon and Regina commenced in 1968 with the conversion of the segment between Saskatoon and Dundurn. Work gradually progressed until the final section between Craik to a point just north of Davidson was twinned in late 1978. With the exception of a three- kilometre, two-lane segment through Chamberlain, the newly constructed four lane sections of the highway bypassed all the towns and villages between Saskatoon and Regina. An initiative to twin the highway between Saskatoon and Prince Albert was launched in the first decade of the 21st century. In 2006, Provincial Highways and Transportation Minister Eldon Lautermilch stated that \\"twinning will improve the province's busiest highways to support tourism and economic development, and move our export goods to market efficiently across inter-provincial borders.\\" Sections of highway nearest to Saskatoon were twinned first; with the paving of newly constructed lanes along a 13-kilometre stretch between Prince Albert and MacDowall, the project was completed on . On June 20, 2001 the entire length of Hwy 11 was re-named the Louis Riel Trail (LRT) at a ceremony which took place at the Duck Lake Regional Interpretive Centre. The LRT connects major sites of the 1885 North-West Rebellion. Mid- Lakes Community coalition, Saskatchewan Highway 11 communities and municipalities, the Saskatchewan M√©tis Nation, and the Saskatchewan History and Folk Lore Society approached Highways and Transportation Minister Pat Atkinson about the designation. Saskatchewan Highway 11 is the actual course followed by the RCMP and Louis Riel to arrive at Regina for the trial of Louis Riel. The LRT sign features a red river cart featured in yellow on a blue background. In 2008, Pinkie Road was a proposed as 4 lane twinned highway connector road linking two National Highway System routes as a part of the Asia-Pacific Gateway and Corridor Initiative (APGCI), linking Hwy 1, the Trans Canada Highway and Hwy 11. This route was expended to continue east and bypass southern and eastern Regina, connecting with Hwy 1 east of the city. The Regina Bypass was opened in October 2019 with Hwy 11 being designated to the western leg of the route, while a bypassed section of Hwy 11 became Hwy 11A. =Maintenance= Divided Highway section of Hwy 11 where shoulder bumps are visible which vibrate the vehicle when driven upon indicating a switch from driving within the driving lane to driving on the highway shoulder. Tenders for construction work on Highway 11 in 2008 amounted to $63.3 million of which $30 million saw twinned between Prince Albert and Saskatoon. Among the upcoming projects which have received approval were the \\"paving of two sections of Highway 11 including of highway north of Osler to south of Hague, and of highway north of Macdowall to the Junction of Highway 2.\\" The first project was scheduled for completion by October 2008. In 2002 a resurfacing project of of Highway 11 was undertaken on a section north of Macdowall. The approval for the $680,000 tender was awarded by Highways and Transportation Minister Mark Wartman. Earlier maintenance included $897,000 for paving of near Hanley for a project cost of $897,000. Highways and Transportation Minister Judy Bradley awarded contracts for work in 1999. The first asphalt rubber project occurred July 2007 on Saskatchewan Highway 11. Close to near Davidson show the rubberized asphalt road surface on the right lane at a cost of $126,800. The next rubberized asphalt project in the summer of 2007, was through the town of Chamberlain. The $1.4 million spent here included the rubberized asphalt pavement surface, curbs and catch basins. \\"The mining, exploration, and oil and gas sectors across northern Saskatchewan funnel thousands of heavy trucks through Prince Albert on a daily basis.

It is recognised as the Queensland town with the longest single-word name, but is affectionately known by locals as \\"The Bun\\". Geography Opal from Squaretop Kaimkillenbun is from Dalby, on the way to the Bunya Mountains and is part of the Darling Downs. The south-eastern half of the locality is predominantly flat farming land centred on the township. The north-western half of the locality has hills including Squaretop (), a mountain of over . Minerals including opals can be found at Squaretop. The Bunya Highway passes through the north-west of the locality. History The name Kaimkillenbun is believed to derive from an Aboriginal word meaning open mouth, possibly associated with a male initiation ceremony. The Bell Branch railway line from Dalby to Bell was opened in 1906 with Kaimkillenbun being served by railway stations at Kaimkillenbun and Squaretop. The line closed in 1984. An attempt was made to establish a hotel in 1908 but the local temperance lobby managed to prevent it. However, in October 1911 local farmer Edwin Higgs successfully obtained a licence and built the Kenilworth Hotel. Soldiers leaving for World War 1 signed on the wall of the pub. Today it is known as The Bun Pub. Kaimkillenbun Post Office opened by June 1909 (a receiving office had been open from 1908). Kaimkillenbun State School opened on 1 November 1909. St Mary's Anglican Church was dedicated on 6 September 1914 by Venerable Henry Le Fanu, Archdeacon of Toowoomba. It closed circa 1997. The Kaimkillenbun war memorial was unveiled on 13 November 1920 by William Vowles, the member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Dalby and Leader of the Opposition. The \\"digger\\" statue was made by R C Ziegler, a Toowoomba stonemason. Originally placed near the Kaimkillenbun railway station, the memorial was damaged in a traffic accident. A replacement from the original plans was commissioned from the Zieglers and was placed in a park behind the hotel (corner of Isabelle and Delacey Streets). In 1983, Kaimkillenbun was the location for filming of the movie Chase Through the Night starring Nicole Kidman. Local residents appear as extras in the film.

It replaced the older Constitution of 1991. The Constitution provides for a presidential system of government, with separation of powers between the three branches. It condemns the Rwandan genocide in the preamble, expressing hope for reconciliation and prosperity.  History  Between 1994 and 2003 Rwanda was governed by a set of documents combining President Habyarimana's 1991 Constitution, the Arusha Accords, and some additional protocols introduced by the transitional government. As required by the Accords, Kagame set up a Constitutional Commission to draft a new permanent Constitution. The Constitution was required to adhere to a set of fundamental principles including equitable power sharing and democracy. The Commission sought to ensure that the draft Constitution was \\"home-grown\\", relevant to Rwanda's specific needs and reflected the views of the entire population. They sent questionnaires to civil groups across the country and rejected offers of help from the international community, except for financial assistance. The draft constitution was released in 2003; it was approved by the Parliament, and was then put to a referendum in May of that year. The government gave the referendum a high profile, which meant that ultimately of eligible adults registered to vote and the turnout on voting day was . The constitution was overwhelmingly accepted, with voting in favour. This constitution, among other things, changed the country's official name from \\"Rwandese Republic\\" to \\"Republic of Rwanda\\".https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Rwanda_2010.pdfhttps://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Rwanda_2015.pdf?lang=en A referendum on the Rwandan constitution was held on 18 December 2015. The amendments would allow President Paul Kagame to run for a third term in office in 2017, as well as shortening presidential terms from seven to five years, although the latter change would not come into effect until 2024.Paul Kagame's third term: Rwanda referendum on 18 December BBC News, 9 December 2015 They were approved by around 98% of voters.Rwanda vote 'allows Kagame to extend term in office' BBC News, 19 December 2015  Overview  The constitution provides for a two house parliament, an elected President serving seven year terms, and multi-party politics. The constitution also sought to prevent Hutu or Tutsi hegemony over political power. Article 54 states that \\"political organizations are prohibited from basing themselves on race, ethnic group, tribe, clan, region, sex, religion or any other division which may give rise to discrimination\\". In general it was men who had organised the Rwandan genocide and they were disproportionately the victims. The constitution reserved 24 of the 80 seats for women and this did not preclude other women from competing for the remaining seats in the lower house. This lower house has had nearly half of its members being female. Six places are also reserved for women in the upper house. According to Human Rights Watch, this clause along with later laws enacted by Parliament effectively make Rwanda a one- party state, as \\"under the guise of preventing another genocide, the government displays a marked intolerance of the most basic forms of dissent\\". Detail Clause 179 of the constitution is concerned with the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide and it creates the National Commission for the Fight against Genocide in Kigali.

A summary of changes to each of these is: H-1B Visa: The bill increases the annual cap of 65,000 immigrants to 115,000, automatically increasing the cap by 20 percent each year the limit is reached. It also creates a new exemption to the cap for anyone who has an \\"advanced degree in science, technology, engineering, or math\\" from a foreign university. Green Card Caps: Sponsored by their employers, workers who earned advanced degrees from accredited U.S. universities will be exempt from the numerical limit. Streamlining Green Card Processing: The bill establishes a pre-certification procedure that is designed to eliminate duplicate documentation of the employer that is common to multiple petitions. It also provides employers with an option to expedite processing of such visa petitions. Current status As of April 2007, the SKIL Bill exists as re-introduced standalone legislation in both the House (H.R.1930) and Senate (S. 1083) and has been referred to the respective Judiciary Committees. As an immediate relief to address shortage of H-1B visas, Sen. Chuck Hagel introduced High-Tech Worker Relief Act (S. 1092), which is another version of SKIL pertaining only to temporary H-1B visa increase and is referred to Senate Judiciary Committee. SKIL Act is also embedded in the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 (S. 2611). \\"Pro\\" Analysis Proponents of the bill claim that some of the brightest students in the world come to US universities to be educated and then end up taking their knowledge and skills with them back to their home countries or other competing nations. They claim that there are not enough skilled workers to fulfill requirements and that a severe shortage looms, threatening US leadership in technical fields. Industry claims their gain is access to a larger skilled workforce. Academia maintains a larger pool of potential students in technical fields. Proponents of the bill also claim that speeding up the process of granting green cards to foreign-born highly-skilled students educated in US universities could prevent companies from taking away jobs from US workers. The bill aims to allow freedom of mobility to highly-skilled foreign-born US-educated workers in the US workforce. The freedom of mobility will eliminate situations where companies could take advantage of foreign-born highly-skilled workers by forcing them to work at lower than prevailing wages in return for a green card sponsorship. \\"Con\\" Analysis Opponents claim that industry is primarily motivated by desire for lower wages. They make the point that if there were a shortage of skilled workers, real wages would be up and unemployment would be down, neither of which is the case. Opponents also claim that this bill would cause an unprecedented flooding of the labor market, as skilled Americans and residents would be displaced in their jobs by immigrants from the developing world who are willing to work at below-market wages in return for permanent residence sponsorship. Opponents also point out that the unemployment rate among engineers with degrees over 45 years old might be as high as 80% based on informal phone surveys. The average length of unemployment mentioned in the phone survey was 3 years. Discouraged workers (those who've been out of work for more than 6 months) are not tracked by the Department of Labor.

When the FIM announced new regulations for the 1968 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season that limited the 500 cc engines to four cylinders, this gave an advantage to teams using two- stroke machinery. Honda decided to withdraw from motorcycle racing to concentrate on its automobile division.http://world.honda.com Part 2 In November 1977 Honda announced it would be returning to motorcycle Grand Prix racing using four-stroke technology. Even though two-stroke engines dominated motorcycle Grand Prix racing in the late 1970s, Honda felt compelled to race what they sold and thus competed using a high-technology, four-stroke race bike.http://world.honda.com Part 4 Since a conventional four-stroke, four- cylinder engine could not produce the same power as its two-stroke rivals, Honda increased its valve area to be competitive.http://world.honda.com Part 5 Oval pistons, piston rings and dual-conrods The rules at the time allowed up to four combustion chambers, so Honda designed a 32-valve V8 with four pairs of linked combustion chambers. This then evolved into an engine with four oval-shaped cylinders. The oval cylinders allowed room for 32 valves and eight spark plugs, the same as that of an eight-cylinder engine while staying within the four-cylinder rules limit. Another innovation used on the NR500 was its monocoque body which wrapped around the engine like a cocoon and helped reduce weight.http://world.honda.com Part 7 In an effort to reduce drag, lower the center of gravity, and to lower gyroscopic forces, the bike used 16-inch Comstar wheels instead of the mainstream 18-inch versions that were commonplace at the time. Honda overcame significant manufacturing problems to develop its oval cylinder technology and by late-1979 the bike made its debut at the British Grand Prix ridden by Mick Grant and Takazumi Katayama. Both bikes retired, Grant crashing on the first turn after the bike spilled oil onto his rear tire, sliding along with the bike showering sparks, requiring rapid application of powder fire retardant from the race marshall. Katayama retired on the seventh lap due to ignition problems when running second- last.Motor Cycle News 15 August 1979, p.4 British Grand Prix race report Accessed and added 12 February 2015http://world.honda.com Part 8 Honda persevered for two more seasons, but never made the bike competitive.Mick Walker's Japanese Grand Prix Racing Motorcycles, by Mick Walker, Publisher Redline Books, 2002 The monocoque frame had to be abandoned because it made it too difficult for mechanics to work on the engine during races. The 16-inch wheels also had to be abandoned for 18-inch wheels.http://world.honda.com Part 9 American Freddie Spencer was able to reach fifth place at the 1981 British Grand Prix before the bike broke down. The NR500 never won a Grand Prix. A thirteenth place by Katayama at the 1981 Austrian Grand Prix was its best showing. Honda abandoned the project and designed the NS500 two-stroke bike to compete in the 1982 season.http://world.honda.com Part 11 Spencer would ride the NS500 to Honda's first 500 cc world championship in 1983. Ultimately, what doomed the NR500 project was that Honda had tried to develop too many technologies at one time. The NR500 did experience a few successes: Freddie Spencer rode the NR500 to a heat race victory at Laguna Seca in 1981 and Kengo Kiyama won the Suzuka 200 kilometer race that same year.http://world.honda.com Part 10  References  NR500 Category:Grand Prix motorcycles Category:Motorcycles introduced in 1979 ","title":"Honda NR500"},{"id":"8024807","text":"George Harrison (2 May 1915 ‚Äì 6 October 2004) was a gun runner for the Provisional Irish Republican Army from the 1950s until 1981. Background Harrison was born in May 1915 in Shammer, Kilkelly, County Mayo, Ireland to parents Tom ‚ÄòYank‚Äô Harrison and Winnie McDermott. The Shammer Harrison grew up in has been described as fiercely Irish Republican, and it was there that the young Harrison experienced the chaotic years of both the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War. In one incident that stayed with him for the rest of his life, he remembered a visit by the Black and Tans to his mother's shop that ended with them assaulting him. During the Civil War a cousin of Harrison, Michael Duffy, was shot while fighting as a part of the Anti-Treaty IRA. Both these incidents contributed to his growing belief in Irish Republicanism. At age 16 in 1931 Harrison joined what remnants remained of the Irish Republican Army. However, by this point, the IRA was at a low ebb and his unit never saw any actual fighting. By the mid-1930s he had emigrated to England where he worked as a farm labourer. He briefly returned to Ireland in 1938 before emigrating again, this time to the United States, settling in New York City. Between April 1944 and February 1946 he served with the US Army in World War II in the Pacific Theatre. Following the war he became active in Irish-American political organisations such as Clan na Gael and the James Connolly Club. It was during this time Harrison became affiliated with Liam Cotter, a fellow Irish immigrant from County Kerry who had also spent time in the IRA. At some point in the mid-1950s, the IRA approached Cotter and Harrison about supplying them arms for their Border Campaign, a request which the pair accepted, beginning a gun running career which would last for several decades. Harrison was able to source arms for the IRA through George de Meo, an Italian-American neighbour of his who had connections to the Mafia as well as gun runners who were supplying rebels in Cuba. In 1962 Cotter and Harrison cut their ties with the IRA as it became apparent the Border campaign was a failure. However, in 1970 D√°ith√≠ √ì Conaill was able to convince them to support the Provisional IRA and they once again began supplying arms to Ireland. In 1975 Harrison appeared before a grand jury investigating arms trafficking; however, he was released without charge. 1981 Arrest and Trial In 1981, Harrison was arrested in an FBI sting code-named \\"Operation Bushmill\\". Harrison, Tom Falvey, Michael Flannery, Pat Mullin, and Danny Gormley were acquitted in a criminal trial held in New York City, which lasted from December 1980 to June 1981. Their acquittal was widely attributed to the unconventional efforts of Harrison's personal attorney, Frank Durkan; the men admitted to their activities but claimed that they believed the operation had Central Intelligence Agency sanction.Cox, Thomas J. _The Trial of the IRA Five_.

Post-acquittal Although he had spent much of the previous decade involved in this operation, his acquittal marked the end of his active career as an IRA gun-runner. Throughout his life he would devote his time to other various left-wing causes, including support for the African National Congress, the Sandinista movement, the Cuban Revolution, the Second Spanish Republic and the Independista (Puerto Rican nationalist) campaign against Puerto Rico's status as an American Commonwealth. Harrison broke with the Provisional Republican Movement in 1986 when Provisional Sinn F√©in dropped the traditional Republican stance of not taking their seats in the Irish parliament. He remained within the Republican Movement through Republican Sinn F√©in and was a founder and activist of the Republican support group Cumann na Saoirse/Irish Freedom Committee in the US. He was a patron of Republican Sinn F√©in until he died. He also took a number of controversial stances within the broader Irish-American community within New York City, including outspoken support for former Mayor David Dinkins, support for the inclusion of LGBT marchers in the New York Saint Patrick's Day Parade and his open defiance of the Ancient Order of Hibernians. He died at the age of 89 in October 2004 from natural causes at his home in Brooklyn, New York City.Ancestry: George Harrison LifeStory References External links *George Harrison 1915-2004 An Appreciation *Unbowed, and Unashamed of His I.R.A.

On January 3, 1972, Germaine was one of the gunmen of the Pierre Hotel armed robbery, where he and his seven cohorts, after binding and gagging the hotel employees, taking the Pierre under siege, ransacked the safe deposit boxes, and plundered an estimated $28,000,000 in jewels and cash. (Refer to 'Contract Killer' by William Hoffman & Lake Headley). He was an excellent stick-up man and burglar. Robert had been married and gave birth to one son, a chemistry salesman and small-time drug dealer, Robert Germaine, Jr. His son would later become the confidential informant that led to the arrest of Henry Hill and subsequently his own father. At the time of his drug trafficking arrest he had been an unsuccessful self-proclaimed freelance writer working on a manuscript. He is portrayed in Goodfellas as the uncredited drug dealer played by Paul Herman. Biography Robert was a self-proclaimed German-American freelance novelist, an expert \\"stick up man\\" who accompanied his mobster partner on hijacking jobs and later Henry Hill's partner in his $2.5 million heroin and cocaine trafficking ring in New York.

His counterpart in the original UK series of The Office is Lee, portrayed by Joel Beckett. The character is seen in 32 episodes. He was a recurring character during Season 1, then moved to being a main character in Seasons 2 and 3. After leaving the show before season 4, he made several guest appearances in Seasons 5-9. Character overview, and biography Roy Anderson is a warehouse dock worker at the Scranton branch of fictitious paper distributor Dunder Mifflin. He was engaged to the office receptionist Pam Beesly for three years when the series begins. He also had a good friendship with warehouse foreman Darryl Philbin which later is shown when he's having beers with him, Jim Halpert and the other warehouse workers during the episode \\"Crime Aid\\". He often shares in the warehouse's typical blue-collar humor. Although generally written as boorish, inconsiderate, and selfish, his character is somewhat less cruel and verbally abusive than his UK counterpart. =Season 1= Roy first appeared as Dunder Mifflin secretary Pam Beesly's fianc√© for over four years until she broke off the engagement. Between seasons 2 and 3. Roy brought along his brother on his first date with Pam, a minor league hockey game; the brothers forgot she was with them and left the game without her while she was in the bathroom. During their long engagement, Roy, on more than one occasion, has seen Jim Halpert flirting with Pam. He claims not to mind, as he likes how Pam is less talkative after having spent time with Jim. =Season 2= Roy is often bored and does not like company get-togethers, particularly when there's no open bar during the episode \\"Casino Night\\". In the episode \\"The Fire\\", he states that he would \\"do\\" Dunder Mifflin accountant Angela Martin while playing \\"Who Would You Do\\", and throughout the first three seasons Angela is shown to have interest on Roy too. Roy is the only character with whom Angela interacts that she never indicates any form of disapproval towards, describing him at various times as being \\"strong and capable\\", and that he has \\"character\\". He vehemently refuses to let Pam apply to a company training program that could advance her talents as an artist.

Now recovered, he intends to win Pam back, regretting how he took her for granted and wanting to make it up to her. In \\"Phyllis' Wedding\\", Roy talks to Pam about their history together and pays Scrantonicity $20 to play \\"their song\\", You Were Meant For Me, by Jewel. They dance and leave the wedding together. Later, in \\"Business School\\", Roy is shown with his brother Kenny at Pam's art show. And as they leave shortly after arriving, Roy tells Pam that \\"your art was the prettiest art of all the art\\", but asks her to leave so that they can go home. They then break up shortly after during the episode \\"Cocktails\\", when Pam confesses to Roy that she kissed Jim on \\"Casino Night\\". In response, an enraged Roy started trashing the bar they were meeting at, and Pam calls the relationship off immediately. With his brother having paid off the bar with money he got from selling his jet-skis, a visibly disturbed Roy states, \\"I am gonna kill Jim Halpert.\\" When he attempts to beat Jim up in the office, Dwight prevents the attack with pepper spray and Roy is quickly fired. Roy later returns to receive his last paycheck and apologizes to Jim, which Jim accepts. He then asks Pam if they can get a cup of coffee after work, which she reluctantly agrees to. At a diner, Pam confesses that their engagement was a big mistake and they were never right for each other. Roy asks if she's going to pursue Jim now, but she quietly declines. Roy encourages her to go after him, telling her, \\"I don't get you, Pam.\\" The two have one final hug outside the diner, and they leave separately. =Season 5= Roy learns from Jim that he and Pam are engaged when Jim wins a night out with the warehouse crew in \\"Crime Aid\\" and Roy joins their group.

His closest counterpart in the British version is Glynn (commonly known as Taffy) although they share little in common except for the role as Warehouse Foreman. Featuring occasionally throughout the first two seasons, he becomes more prominently involved during the later seasons of the show. Overview Extremely relaxed and competent in his role, Darryl oversees the warehouse for the Scranton branch of fictitious paper distributor Dunder Mifflin. The warehouse workers generally go about their business without getting distracted from the various antics and shenanigans taking place upstairs in the office. Biography Although he is dry and often exasperated when dealing with Michael Scott, the office manager, he seems to be a much more relaxed, silly person in social situations. Unlike Michael, Darryl is competent, ambitious, and innovative, and on several occasions late into the series he promotes ideas to corporate that seem to benefit the company greatly. Michael refers to him as \\"Mittah Rogers\\"‚Äîa nickname which began as \\"Regis\\" (as Darryl's last name is Philbin, a reference to Regis Philbin who is producer Michael Schur's father-in-law), then \\"Reeg\\", \\"Roger\\" and then finally settling on \\"Mittah Rogers\\". In contrast with this, Darryl almost always calls Michael \\"Mike\\" instead of by his full name (although he will call him by his full name when he becomes frustrated or annoyed with Michael's immaturity). Being in a position of responsibility in a potentially hazardous work area, he dislikes Michael's disregard for rules or safety, as Michael often disrupts their work schedule and delays their shipments from going out on time. His relationship with Michael is tense, as he is often aggravated by Michael's juvenile antics, as when he stated his greatest fear is that someone would prevent them from getting the shipments out on time. His rapport with the rest of the staff both in the office and warehouse is friendly. He was initially enemies with Andy Bernard but the two eventually become close friends and confidants. Darryl is a Presbyterian and enjoys feeding squirrels (\\"Fun Run\\"). He has a young daughter named Jada who is incredibly important to him. He has an allergy to soy (\\"Lotto\\"). He appeared as the U.S. President in Michael's short film \\"Threat Level Midnight\\" just so his daughter would see a black man as President, but it took 11 years to be produced and by that time Barack Obama was in office. Darryl is divorced and for a short time, he dated Kelly Kapoor. Kelly broke up with him via text to go back to Ryan, and Darryl was relieved to be out of the relationship as he was shown almost dancing to his car afterward. As is also evidenced from numerous episodes such as \\"Christmas Party\\" and \\"Local Ad\\", Darryl is also very adept at playing the keyboard and singing. Darryl drives a heavy-duty (Vortec) last-generation GMC Sierra crew cab stake truck for work at Dunder- Mifflin, which he uses to move Holly Flax up to Nashua, New Hampshire. His personal car is also a Chevrolet Silverado, though a recent model. It is equipped with remote start. Character history =Seasons 1‚Äì2= Darryl is first seen (briefly) in the episode \\"The Alliance\\" watching Dwight come out of the box he was hiding in the warehouse. In the next episode, \\"Basketball\\", he and the other warehouse workers play Michael's team of office workers in a game of basketball‚Äîthe loser of which will have to work on Saturday. When Michael ends the game on a dubious \\"flagrant foul\\" call (while his team was ahead), he informs them that as a result, they have to work Saturday. When Darryl and the other warehouse workers confront him, Michael (intimidated by the much larger men) gives in and allows them to have the day off. Darryl seems to be the only character on the show who calls Michael \\"Mike\\" besides Andy (although Dwight did at one time refer to Michael as \\"Mike\\" in \\"The Coup\\").Season 1 In \\"Sexual Harassment\\", when his team watches a training video, Darryl stops the clip to point out he has had sexual intercourse with the white actress, which is met with cheering from his colleagues. Darryl wants to wear the Santa hat for the company Christmas party, but Michael does not let him because he is black (although in the end, he gives the hat to Darryl). He is usually forced into Michael's scheduling of events in the warehouse, such as a \\"Men's Day\\" workgroup session, and a \\"Casino Night\\" mock- casino. Darryl attempts to organize the warehouse workers into a union, but his efforts are quickly stamped out by Jan Levinson, Michael's boss. As a subtle prank and possible retort to Michael's antics, Darryl teaches Michael \\"black man phrases\\", such as \\"fleece it out\\", \\"goin' mach five\\", \\"bippity boppity, gimme the zoppity\\", and \\"dinkin' flicka.\\" In addition, Darryl teaches Michael a handshake that Michael believes to be \\"ghetto\\".Season 2 =Seasons 3‚Äì4= When the Scranton‚ÄìStamford merger threatens to close the Scranton branch, Bob Vance of Vance Refrigeration offered to purchase the Dunder- Mifflin warehouse and keep Darryl and the rest of the warehouse staff employed, with Darryl remaining an employee of Dunder-Mifflin after Scranton stayed open. In \\"A Benihana Christmas\\", he brought up his synthesizer to take place of the broken karaoke machine for Karen and Pam's office party. In \\"Back from Vacation\\", Darryl is the unwitting e-mail recipient of Michael's spicy vacation photo with Jan Levenson and proceeds to forward it to everyone else while making it clear to Michael he is not sympathetic to his plight and has no intention of helping him \\"erase\\" the photo from circulation. In \\"The Negotiation,\\" Darryl seeks to negotiate a pay raise with Michael, and when he finds out Michael barely earns more than he does, decides to help Michael get his own raise via a trip to New York. This doesn't stop him, however, from ridiculing Michael for mistakenly wearing a woman's suit. He also admits to teaching Michael more imaginary \\"black man\\" slang, especially the phrase \\"bippity boppity gimme the zoppity.\\" This subplot also shows that Darryl thinks well of Toby Flenderson when he invites Toby (who was forced to go with Michael to NYC on Jan's orders) to crash at Darryl's relatives place overnight, an offer he pointedly does not extend to Michael. In \\"Safety Training\\", Darryl leads a seminar on workplace safety for the staff, where Michael is obnoxious but Darryl repeatedly turns the tables by making Michael look pathetic in front of everyone else. During this episode, Darryl reveals in a talking head interview that he is on crutches because of Michael kicking a ladder that he was standing on and saying \\"Hey, Darryl, how's it hangin'?\\" just before Darryl fell. Later on, Darryl subsequently saves Michael's life by talking him out of jumping off a building when Michael tries to demonstrate the dangers of depression, basically implying that Michael is brave because he continues to get up and live his life every day in spite of being himself. In a deleted scene from \\"Ben Franklin\\", Darryl says that he has a three-year-old daughter. In Season 4, it is revealed that he is actually divorced and does not have primary custody of her, although he does see her often.Season 3 It is revealed early on in \\"Fun Run\\" that Darryl is a Presbyterian, much to the delight of Pam, who turns around and high-fives him because she is also from the \\"same religion\\" as she puts it. Later on in Fun Run, Darryl feeds a squirrel and is caught by Michael, who at that moment was just entering into a short speech about rabies; Darryl then ignores the run to chat with Elizabeth, the \\"nurse\\" who was previously seen in \\"Ben Franklin\\". In \\"Launch Party\\", Darryl is seen delivering some paper to Kelly in front of an outraged Dwight. Darryl defends her and Kelly begins to show some attraction to Darryl. In the episode \\"Money\\", Kelly and Darryl kiss in the conference room, confirming their relationship. Darryl notes that in that and other cases, Kelly only is romantic towards him when Ryan Howard is around. He tells Kelly that he likes her but she needs to stop acting in a crazy and negative way (\\"you need to access your uncrazy side\\"), and warns her pointedly about that when she does start being nasty to him. She responds with confusion, saying, \\"Darryl Philbin is the most complicated man I have ever met. Who says exactly what they're thinking? What kind of game is that?\\" It appears from that point forward that they have begun dating, and Kelly says Darryl is her boyfriend during \\"The Deposition\\". In \\"Did I Stutter?\\", when asked by Michael whether he had ever been in a gang, Darryl \\"admitted\\" to being in such gangs as both the Bloods, the Crips, and the Latin Kings, as well as the Warriors and the Newsies, without Michael realizing that they were groups of males in movies. Darryl also taught Mike the term \\"Fluffy Fingers\\" (the resolution for two gang members who have a problem with one another ‚Äì tickling). His tolerance of Michael is remarkably high, given the aforementioned incident in \\"Safety Training\\" where Michael causes him to break his ankle.Season 4 =Seasons 5‚Äì7= Darryl is still going out with Kelly, though during one of their make- out sessions on the couch in reception, Kelly continuously looks up at Ryan, who is filling in for Pam as the receptionist, suggesting the continued idea that she's only dating him to make Ryan jealous. In \\"Baby Shower\\", Michael asks Darryl for advice as a fellow \\"baby daddy\\" regarding why he felt no connection with Jan's baby. Darryl is quick to point out that he is not one and that Jan's baby is not his, hence why he felt no connection. In \\"Crime Aid\\", Darryl helps Michael put together a Bruce Springsteen playlist, although he notes bemusedly that Michael confused several other artists for The Boss. Darryl and the warehouse workers auction off an opportunity for someone to join them at a bar for some beers immediately, merely as an excuse to avoid participating at the auction. Michael attempts to make a bid as he has wanted to do something like that with them for a while, but Darryl denies him, stating it would be a \\"conflict of interests\\". Jim makes a bid of $5 and Darryl immediately sells it to him and they leave. At the bar, they encounter Roy for the first time since he was fired. In \\"Employee Transfer\\", Darryl, with his truck, and Michael help Holly Flax move to Nashua, New Hampshire. When Holly realizes that their relationship can't work, she begins crying. Michael, not realizing yet that the relationship won't work, attributes the crying to Darryl by asking Holly, \\"What's wrong? Did Darryl touch you?\\" Darryl is forced to endure Michael's begging of Holly to not break up. When driving back from dropping Holly off, Darryl attempts to console Michael by singing a \\"blues\\" tune, and Michael eventually joins in. The song has no words, just the stereotypical guitar riff, and is another example of Darryl's amusing himself by teaching Michael about \\"authentic\\" black culture (although he originally tried to teach Michael to express his problems through song, Michael did not understand). In \\"Customer Survey\\", Darryl states that although he is not a believer in therapy, he thinks that Michael should have some, saying \\"I'll go into my own pocket to cover his co-pay.\\" In \\"Business Trip\\", Kelly breaks up with Darryl, who takes it well as evidenced by how he walks toward his truck after doing it, with an obviously delighted bounce in his step.Season 5 During \\"The Meeting\\", Darryl files for a worker's comp claim with Toby when a ladder broke his leg. But the nature of the claim arouses suspicion in Dwight who suggests that he and Toby investigate the matter. The two spy on Darryl at his house and mistake his sister for him upon seeing her carry a bag of dog food over her shoulder. Darryl confronts the two and it's inadvertently discovered that he's using the lift in the warehouse as an elevator, which is the cause of his injury. Darryl admits to this and Dwight intends to file a complaint with corporate about the situation while Darryl intends to file a complaint to corporate about Dwight sexually harassing his sister. This in turn causes a mountain of paperwork for Toby.Season 6 Oscar has a crush on Matt, a new warehouse employee who is also gay in \\"Secret Santa\\", prompting Oscar to ask Darryl about Matt's whereabouts by personally delivering his paycheck. When Darryl says Matt is momentarily out, Oscar decides to stand and wait. Seemingly aware of Oscar's crush, Darryl playfully nudges Oscar by complimenting Matt's looks and prompting Oscar to blush and leave. In the same episode, he is seen having a friendly conversation with Angela Martin. Darryl later helps organize an after work get together in \\"Happy Hour\\" for Oscar's benefit, so he can get to know Matt better. Although when it seems as if Matt won't come to the event, Darryl tells Oscar that they really don't have anything in common. In the St. Patrick's Day episode Darryl impresses Jo, the CEO of Sabre with his new shipping plan and she gives Darryl Jim's old office. Michael awkwardly asks if Jo owes Darryl reparations for slavery, and Darryl firmly tells Michael to leave his office. Darryl is later embarrassed when the warehouse workers come up and note he has his shirt tucked in. When Sabre's \\"sales is king\\" policy gets to the sales staff's heads by acting obnoxiously to non-sales staff in \\"New Leads\\", Darryl encourages Michael to stand up to the sales staff. This is prompted by Andy Bernard intruding into Darryl's office and demanding a pencil, then trying to wrestle one out of his hand. Darryl is pleased when he gets a chance to avenge Andy's various behaviors towards him by pranking him over Andy's concerns about exploding printers, but is stunned to see that Andy was right about the printers, and resolves to live a better life and NEVER prank anyone anymore. During \\"The Sting\\", Andy is inspired to start his own band after seeing a former classmate's successful music career. He enlists Kevin and Darryl to join the band, although Andy's song is poorly received by the rest of the staff. Andy goes back to the drawing board to produce a better song with Darryl's help, of which the two end up becoming friends. Andy becomes overzealous about their friendship in \\"China\\" by constantly texting Darryl to his annoyance. When Darryl gives Andy an ultimatum that he's one text away from being banned by texting him, Andy wagers it into telling him that his next text will be so good that Darryl will have to high five him. This is proved when Andy finds pigeons eating an ice cream cone and texts Darryl to witness it. Darryl admits to being one of the leakers of the exploding-copier story in \\"Whistleblower\\", telling Michael he was flirting with a reporter at a bar, and then being genuinely mortified after admitting that she wasn't really that hot. When the staff goes to see a local production of Sweeney Todd (which Andy is performing in) in \\"Andy's Play\\", Darryl informs Michael the lead role is his plumber, which irritates Michael a great deal since he tried out for the part and didn't make it. At the end of the play Michael angrily boos the actor playing Sweeney Todd. The actor later confronts Michael at the cast party. Darryl teases Michael by booing him shortly after the actor leaves the conversation. In \\"Costume Contest\\", one of Darryl's ideas (having the warehouse workers give clients sales pitches when they make their deliveries) is an immediate hit. Michael is angry at the corporate office because Darryl had pitched him this same idea, and Michael rejected it, so he believes that they stole the idea‚Äîbut Gabe tells him that Darryl brought the idea to him and he and Jo both liked it. Michael lashes out at Darryl for going over his head, while Darryl is angry at Michael for ignoring his ideas and adds that Michael has never done anything to help Darryl's career, pointing out that Ed Truck hired him and Jo promoted him. The two men bury the hatchet somewhat by agreeing to marginalize Gabe. Later, Darryl turns to Andy for advice, who encourages him to find out what he wants with his career by relating how he joined his college A cappella group. Darryl then tells Andy he's not going to a Halloween party in order to get some work done, as he has \\"big plans for this company\\". During \\"Viewing Party\\", Darryl advises a distraught Andy over Erin's relationship with Gabe. Darryl is later overjoyed to have Jada, his daughter in \\"Classy Christmas\\" for the holidays to spend time with him. But she refuses to go by thinking of it as being boring, which upsets Darryl. Pam and Andy convince Darryl to bring her to the office Christmas party and insist that he could make it fun for Jada. He convinces his daughter to go with the fact that she could sit on Santa's lap and tell him what she wants. The party initially becomes a disaster when Jada sees that Santa is Michael's alternative \\"classy\\" version and Andy ruins some of the fun holiday activities that he and Pam have created for her. But this later becomes a success when Jada is surprised at the vending machine room, and Darryl hatches the idea to hand out snacks as gifts for the staff that becomes fun. Touched by this gesture, Michael dresses up as a regular Santa Claus and Jada sits on his lap and tells him what she wants for Christmas, while Darryl looks on in joy. It is revealed in \\"Classy Christmas\\" that Darryl is a fan of \\"iCarly\\", in particular, Freddie, \\"that dude with the camera.\\" However, he does not enjoy \\"The Suite Life\\" (As revealed by Mindy Kaling in a Q&A; segment on OfficeTally.com). In \\"Ultimatum\\", When Dwight reveals his New Years resolution is to \\"meet loose women\\", he goes out on the town along with fellow single men Darryl and Andy, in the hopes in meeting some women. First they try a bookstore (where Darryl begins fulfilling his own resolution to \\"read more\\" by purchasing an e-book reader which he conceals from Dwight and Andy), but later end up at a roller skating rink where they fail to find women (being that the rink is almost completely empty). Dwight skates off to a nearby strip club, Darryl uses his e-book reader and later lies that he was playing video games, and Andy skates around by himself to the music of Dave Matthews Band. They all end up having a great time skating around the rink underneath its strobe lights. In the beginning of \\"PDA\\", Pam comes into Darryl's office to try to comfort him in the death of his almost 97-year-old grandmother. She gives him a card that she had everyone in the office sign, but they thought it was his birthday and sign things that sound like they're happy his grandmother died, which makes him feel even worse. Later in the episode, Andy tags along on a romantic treasure hunt Gabe has made for Erin (despite the fact that he is dating a friend of Darryl's named Rachel, who was the only other Caucasian at one of Darryl's parties), The hunt starts with a puzzle picture, which leads to Gabe's stereo in Darryl's office. Darryl is greatly annoyed by the presence of Andy and Erin. In \\"Todd Packer\\", after Pam gets Andy a new computer and they scratch it up as to not make it look brand new, Pam claims that she found it in the warehouse. Darryl subtly confronts Pam later regarding finding the computer in the warehouse. As he knows everything that's in the warehouse and where, he leverages Pam into giving him more sick days. In \\"Garage Sale\\", Darryl, Andy and Kevin play and bet on the Dallas board game (which Kevin had for sale). Since the instruction booklet is not with the game, Darryl and Andy make up the rules as they go along, much to Kevin's objection. Eventually, Kevin notices the money they had bet on the game with is missing, and storms out. As Darryl and Andy look at each other in confusion, Kevin reveals to the cameras that he has the money, stating, \\"And that... is Dallas\\", mocking Andy and Darryl's previous statement. In \\"Training Day\\", Darryl, like his co-workers, wants to make a good impression on the new boss Deangelo Vickers. After learning that Deangelo likes the Southwest, Darryl says that the southwest is one of his favorite Regions. In a talking-head interview he worries that the comment made him sound lame, but he convinces himself that it was cool. However, he ruins it by telling Deangelo that he loves the desert, because it's one of his favorite Eco-systems. Later, he has his sister buy him cowboy attire and deliver it to him in the parking lot. In \\"Michael's Last Dundies\\", he still wears the cowboy clothes in the workplace. He also backs the employees up on his keyboard when they serenade the soon-to-depart Michael with a version of \\"Seasons of Love\\" with altered lyrics. In \\"Goodbye, Michael\\", Michael gives Darryl the only copy of his unfinished management book, \\"Somehow, I Manage\\". In the beginning of \\"The Inner Circle\\", Deangelo informs Darryl that because of his request, the company is sending him to business school, but at night. Darryl is also one of Deangelo Vicker's favorites among the staff and a part of his \\"inner circle\\". He is also learning the Chinese language in this episode. In \\"Search Committee\\", Darryl applies for the manager position. =Seasons 8‚Äì9= During \\"The Incentive\\", it is established that Darryl is dating his ex-wife Justine, although the relationship seems short-lived when she seems to take an interest in an employee of Darryl's in \\"Lotto\\". During which, the warehouse employees win big in the lottery and quit their jobs on the spot, prompting the sales staff to pick up the slack and try to get orders out on time. Darryl was originally part of the bet by using his own birthday as the lucky numbers before opting out when Jo promoted him to work in the office. Coupled with Justine's interest in someone else, a despondent Darryl self-sabotages his job when the branch desperately needs new warehouse staff. When he and Andy try conducting a group interview, it ends in disaster when he makes disparaging remarks to Andy's frustration. Darryl tries to get himself fired by Andy, before admitting that he wanted the branch manager job, as he believed it was his. However, Andy, who had asked about Darryl's potential to become branch manager before he accepted, is direct and tells Darryl that he gave up the ambition by not continuing with college courses (under Deangelo's brief management) and prioritizing his personal life over a potential career, as well as pointing out that Jo Bennett really liked Darryl and saw potential in him. Although Andy promises that he can help Darryl continue his education if he chooses, and the two reconcile. Darryl says in a talking head interview that lottery balls won't define his future, but two black balls and he hires a new warehouse crew. Darryl also plays along with Andy's new nicknames, referring to Erin as E-dog after she calls him D-Dog. In \\"Garden Party\\", Andy hosts a garden party to impress both the CEO and secretly his parents. Darryl overhears a conversation via a baby monitor, where Andy is browbeaten by his father over his job status. He later confides to the camera that he understands why Andy tries to prove himself to everyone. When Andy tries to leave early as the garden party turns into a staff barbecue, Darryl prevents him from leaving by giving him food and in turn, cheering him up. In Gettysburg and Trivia Darryl, along with Jim, supports Andy as he struggles with being manager. He appears to accept the fact that Andy was chosen over him. Darryl seems to like the new warehouse worker, Val, in several episodes including Doomsday and Special Project. In After Hours, Val's boyfriend Brandon gets jealous of her and Darryl, to which Val claims there is nothing going on. Darryl, however, says a relationship between the two is not ridiculous after encouragement from Pam and Andy. In Free Family Portrait Studio, Darryl lets former warehouse workers Calvin and Hide to come back to work after their investment in an energy drink for Asian homosexuals falls through. Darryl also lets Val and Brandon know that he is pursuing her, to which Brandon insults Darryl, who takes it in stride. Val, impressed with his bravado, holds his hand in a portrait with him and his daughter Jada. In Roy's Wedding, it is implied that he and Val are together. In Andy's Ancestry, it is revealed that Andy gave him the title of Assistant Regional Manager and he is excited to find ways to increase productivity, but ultimately grows increasingly dissatisfied as Andy is too concerned about his personal issues to listen to his job suggestions. He tells Jim in the warehouse that he wants to quit. Jim tells Darryl about his sports marketing job opportunity in Philadelphia and offers him to join. Darryl then convinces Jim to tell Pam about the opportunity before proceeding. In \\"Dwight Christmas\\", Darryl suspects that Jim forgot about his offer to take him to his Philadelphia job, and as a result, gets extremely drunk and prepares to tell Jim off. Before he can, Jim reveals he talked to his friends about giving Darryl a job interview. In \\"Lice\\", Darryl breaks up with Val to prepare for his move to Philadelphia. However, Nellie, Phyllis, and Kevin convince Val to reconcile with Darryl, much to his dismay. In \\"Suit Warehouse\\", Darryl goes down to Philadelphia to interview for Athlead and takes Pam with him so she can visit Jim. Darryl, who is inexperienced at interviews, openly admits under pressure that he feels unqualified due to him being a warehouse foreman. The other interviewers and Jim put him at ease by talking about their previous lower level positions. Darryl regains composure and offers them all booklets with ideas on how to advance the company. The interview ends well until Darryl shoots a basketball into a hoop, but he misses and kills a bunch of fish in a fishtank. Despite this, Darryl is offered the position, but will have to replace the fish. In \\"Customer Loyalty\\", Dwight pulls out all the stops to try to keep Darryl from going to Athlead. He forces Darryl to go on a delivery with him and tries to cheer him up by ordering a milkshake at a drive-through and throwing it at the employee. Darryl forces Dwight to stay and clean it up, when another customer throws his milkshake at Dwight. Darryl then watches the video of it online, stating he's going to miss Dunder Mifflin. In \\"Vandalism\\", Darryl has moved into Jim's Philadelphia apartment while working at Athlead, but Darryl is annoyed by Jim's lack of cleanliness while Jim is annoyed by Darryl's labelling of his own items. After an argument, Darryl decides to be less territorial and Jim decides to clean up. After the finale, it is revealed that Darryl is now the V.P. of Athlete Relations at Athlead. He reconciled with his ex-wife Justine, who moved with their daughter Jada to Austin in order to be with him.

The station is owned by Townsquare Media. Its studios and transmitter are located in south Lubbock. History KZII went on air on April 15, 1948 as KFYO-FM. According to Jack Dale, it signed off a few years later (in 1950) after limited use. From the 1950 edition of Broadcasting Yearbook KFYO-FM broadcast on 99.5 FM (now the present-day KQBR-FM, Lonestar 99.5) at 13,000 watts of power. Then in mid-March 1982 the station was back on the air as KRUX. Studios were on the third floor of the Plains Bank building at 5010 50th, and the transmitter was at 98th and University (the KJTV tower). Station featured \\"six packs\\" of country music. It was owned by Rex Broadcasting Corporation of owner of KCUB (AM) and KIIM (FM) in Tucson, Az, and KROD (AM) and KLAQ (FM) in El Paso, Texas. Rex was owned by Jim Sloane, and had filed for the station on 102.5 in 1977. A couple of other local stations (580 KDAV and 1590 KEND) also filed for the channel. The original engineering had been prepared by Guy Smith at the Ray Moran stations (Albuquerque and Roswell). Moran filed for 101.1 in 1973 and received it unopposed in 1973, went on air in 1974. Sloane delayed filing until the later seventies and ended up in a comparative hearing for the station. KRUX was sold to the owners of crosstown 790 KFYO in mid-1985. Studios were consolidated at the KFYO Transmitter Site at 4322 82nd Street (present-day Kingsgate North shopping center). Then, in 1986 the Z102/KFYO studios and KFYO 790 AM transmitter site were moved to 143rd Street & South Slide Road, south of Lubbock, south of FM 1585. The studios were then moved again in the Fall of 1996 to the then Gulfstar (later Capstar, then AM/FM, then Clear Channel in 2001, then GAP and now Townsquare Media) studios at 4413 82nd Street (82nd and Quaker). By year end in 1985, the 102.5 transmitter had been relocated to a temporary location in north Lubbock, and in 1985-1986 the transmitter was moved to a new tower at 82nd and Avenue P (The Lubbock Tower) shared by then 94.5 KFMX, 96.3 KLLL, 99.5 KRLB (now KQBR), and 102.5 KFYO-FM. In the late 1990s ('98 or '99) 98.1 KKCL moved on to The Lubbock Tower, with 95.5 KAIQ-FM moving onto The Lubbock Tower in 2004. After Gulfstar's parent company, Capstar, merged with Chancellor Broadcasting, these stations were eventually sold to one of the Hicks family controlled groups that were later rolled up into Clear Channel Communications. In 2006, Clear Channel announced they were going private, and later announced they would sell many of their smaller market stations, including their cluster in Lubbock. GAP Broadcasting purchased these stations, including KZII-FM. On Tuesday, March 17, 2009 at midnight, GAP Broadcasting dropped the Z102 format in favor of the \\"Kiss FM\\" branding. The station became 102.5 Kiss FM at 5 p.m. on March 20, 2009. What eventually became Gap Central Broadcasting (following the formation of GapWest Broadcasting) was folded into Townsquare Media on August 13, 2010. Programming Kiss FM's current format is Mainstream CHR which is a variant of Top 40, although the station has shifted between Mainstream CHR and Rhythmic CHR over the past 10 years, as different stations entered the Lubbock market to compete. From the 1990s through mid-2001, Z102 was the home of Jay (Shannon), Chris (Kelly) and Dina (Morales) in the Morning. The show was regionally syndicated throughout West Texas in the late 1990s, 2000 & 2001\\\\. Affiliate stations included Power 98.7 in Amarillo, 103.3 KCRS-FM Midland/Odessa and 100.7 FM in Abilene. The show (and Texas syndication) briefly moved to 96.7 KHFI-FM, in Austin, in 2001. Before the end of 2001, Chris & Dina moved back to Lubbock to host \\"Chris & Dina in the Morning\\" which was exclusively heard on Z102. Jay Shannon then went on to serve two separate stints as OM/PD for KHFI from 2001 to 2014. In his time at KHFI, Shannon found a DJ named Bobby Bones and eventually created a morning show centered on him. The present-day Bobby Bones Show was originally patterned after \\"Jay, Chris & Dina in the Morning\\" with Bobby filling the role that Jay served, Lunchbox filling the antagonist Chris Kelly role and Amy taking Dina's role. For a number of years in the 2000s, into the early 2010s, on Saturdays from 8 to 11PM KISS FM broadcast live from Heaven Nightclub called \\"Saturday Night Heaven\\". The remote broadcast was ended in 2011. In March 2016, assistant program director Boleo brought back the weekend party with Turn Up Friday's which originates from Lubbock's Club Pink. It would later move to Saturday nights in a sporadic fashion. The 5 O'Clock Bomboocha began on KISS FM in February 2017. The original host was Tommy the Hacker simulcasting from Townsquare sister station 96.9 KXSS FM, Tommy the Hacker would do the show from Wild 104.3 - KQFX-FM Amarillo - after his departure from KXSS. In late March 2017, DJ Lopez would take over hosting and DJ duties on the Bomboocha.http://1025kiss.com/we-answer-your-questions-about-the-bomboocha/ As of June 2018 hosting duties were split between DJ Lopez, Tommy the Hacker and Local DJ Ricky Ri. The Bomboocha was discontinued in July 2019 by Townsquare Corporate despite local outrage for the cancellation. On air, Z102's positioning included \\"Hot Hitz, 102.5 Z102\\"; \\"H - I - T - Z102\\" (How you spell Hits); \\"Continuous Hit Music, 102.5 Z102\\"; \\"Your #1 Hit Music Station, 102.5 Z102\\"; and was \\"Lubbock's #1 Hit Music Station, Z102\\" prior to changing to the \\"Kiss FM\\" branding.

It placed 37 by revenues on Canada's Top 50 Co-operatives in 2007.Top 50 Canadian Co-operatives (2007) - Co-operatives Secretariat Organization Management is divided into seven different departments: *Administration *Petroleum *Animal Feed *Hardware & Family Fashions *Retail Food *Human Resources *Credit The General Manager who oversees all departments is hired permanently, not elected like the Board of Directors. Membership & Patronage System Anyone wishing to join the Otter Co-op must fill in an application and pay the $10 lifetime membership fee. Upon acceptance, members will be assigned a membership number as well as a membership card. Memberships can be passed on to anyone of the age of majority. Each dollar spent by a member is totaled and at the end of the year, members are issued a patronage refund of equity, in proportion to this total. The rate of the patronage refund is determined by the finance committee and changes yearly. In fiscal 2007, the Co-op's sales exceeded $98 million and the percentage projected patronage allocation for 2008 was set at 6.97%. Each year, a fixed minimum of purchases is also set and members whose purchases surpass that minimum will be awarded a portion of their refund in cash and the rest allocated to their equity account. Members whose purchases totaled less than that minimum have their entire refund added to their equity account. In 1999, the minimum was set to $295 and any member spending more that year would receive 55% (minus taxes) back in the form of a cheque. Entire equity repayments are made to members who have died, who have turned 69 years of age or who have moved out of the area and are no longer able to make use of the Co-op. Also, no single member may hold more than $25,000 in equity. Any accounts surpassing that limit will receive a cash refund. History The Otter District Farmers' Institute (ODFI) incorporated on November 13, 1922. The twenty-five original members, both men and women, had a mandate to promote agricultural awareness and improve life so that settlement would be permanent and prosperous.Terry-Lynn Stone, \\"Otter District Farmers' Institute/Otter Co-op, 1922-2000,\\" in The Place Between Vol. 2 ed. Aldergrove Heritage Society (Langley: Friesen Co., 2001) In the early part of the twentieth century, the Otter District of British Columbia was sparsely populated and heavily forested. The few hundred farmers attempting to clear the land for agriculture needed stumping powder to blast out tree stumps after the trees had been felled. Costs for the blasting powder and for its transportation were quite high, so the Farmers' Institute began to buy bulk and sell locally to its members, greatly reducing the price. Membership increased and with it, demand for cheap farming products. In 1926, the ODFI began selling animal feed to area farmers. By the end of the decade, the Institute was still selling stumping powder, but also carried hay, clover, barbed wire and fertilizer. By 1946, the number of retail items had increased enough that the ODFI built a grocery and hardware store on 248th street. Starting in 1950, a bulk petroleum plant sold gas and diesel for farm use, as well as home heating oil and propane. The ODFI also organized for monthly speakers to make presentations in the hope of educating local farmers. By 1945, the Co-op had over 160 members in the area. The need for food preservation was brought to their attention, and in 1946, Co-operative Cold Storage Lockers were made available. While the bulk petroleum plant had been in use since 1950, it was not until 1972 that a gas bar was purchased to sell for gas for automobiles. Trying to maintain relevance in what was fast becoming a modern world, the ODFI converted to an official Co-operative on June 22, 1979 under the Cooperative Association Act. The organization had long encouraged Co-operative values, until this point it was officially considered a society. A new name was chosen to reflect the new status: the Otter Farm & Home Co-operative. On January 17 the following year, they would open a new shopping center. The 1980s were a hard decade for the Otter Farm & Home Co- operative. High interest rates and a nationwide recession lowered consumer confidence and sales were way down. Business became so bad that fears rose as to the Co-op's survival, since mortgage payments on the new shopping center still needed to be made. The former general manager came out of retirement to help keep things going, and employees willingly accepted a reduction in wages in order to help save the Co-op from impending demise. Federated Co-operatives Ltd., the wholesale supplier did what it could to help. By 1983, members were informed that the Co-op had lost $1,891,500. The Co-op survived, however, due mostly to the heightened support of members even during hard economic times. The increase in sales both at the gas bar and at the bulk petroleum plant also helped to stem the tide of the recession. As the Co-op's financial situation began to turn around, much needed improvements went underway. A new oil storage warehouse was opened in February 1990. In 1997, the gas bar was totally rebuilt for both speed and functionality, and because of environmental concerns. The Co-op celebrated its 75th Anniversary the same year with large- scale festivities and a special supplement in a local newspaper commemorating Co-operative involvement in the community. The Co-op's mortgage was finally paid off in 1998, and much needed renovations on the shopping center were started immediately. The improvements were completed in October 1999 without the need for another loan. A new deli was built, the grocery area was enlarged and a fashion boutique was installed. Principles *Membership is kept open and voluntary. Anyone may join, but non-members are quite welcome to make purchases in all departments. *Democratic control with one vote for each member. Membership includes the right to attend Annual General Meetings and vote for Board of Directors, as well as the right to run in the election. Each position on the board is for a three-year term and candidates are limited to three consecutive terms on the board. *Co-operative education. Directors are all given the opportunity to upgrade their skills, particularly at regional and national Co-operative conferences. The Co-op regularly gives $500 post- secondary scholarships to graduating high school students and supports four local 4H clubs. *Co-operation among Co-operatives. Otter Co-op has invested substantial capital in its wholesale supplier, Federated Co-operatives Limited based out of Saskatoon. In addition, large donations and discounts are regularly made to non-profit organizations within the community. *Otter Co-op makes no promises to keep prices below those of their competitors, but it guarantees high-quality products and excellent service.

Rattlesnakes: Their Habitats, Life Histories, and Influence on Mankind. Second Edition. 2 volumes. Reprint, University of California Press, Berkeley. . tzabcan (local name for subspecies C. s. tzabcan) Crotalus simus is a venomous pit viper species found in Mexico and Central America. The specific epithet is Latin for \\"flat-nosed\\", likely because its head is blunt compared with lanceheads (Bothrops). Three subspecies are recognized, including the nominate subspecies described here. Adults commonly exceed 130 cm (51 in) in length, with males growing larger than females. Large males reach 140‚Äì160 cm (55‚Äì63 in) in some populations. The maximum length is 180 cm (71 in). The body has a rough appearance because the dorsal scale keels are accentuated into protuberances or tuberculations. This is most apparent on the scale rows on either side of the body with a decreasing intensity in the lower rows. The vertebral scales are about as prominently keeled as the fourth row down on the flanks (with the vertebral scales as the first row). This species is found from Mexico in southwestern Michoac√°n on the Pacific coast, and Veracruz and the Yucatan Peninsula on the Atlantic coast, south through Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua to west-central Costa Rica. It is absent from Panama, but apparently does occur on the Atlantic side of Colombia. The type locality given is \\"Ceylan\\", which is incorrect. Its habitats are semiarid, including dry or very dry tropical forests, thorn woodland, and arid scrub forest. It also occurs in mesic forests with relatively dry, open areas. To the Mayans and their living descendants, the Yucatan subspecies (C. s. tzabcan) was greatly revered. The word tzabcan means rattlesnake in Mayan. What the rattlesnake actually symbolizes is unknown, but many temples have carved rattlesnake shapes. Shamans also dry and roast snakes, grinding them into a powder used as medicine. Bites are similar to rattlesnake bites in the United States. Local symptoms may be severe, with pain, massive swelling, blistering, and necrosis that lead to fasciotomies and in some cases amputations. Systemic effects involving hemostatic disturbances are rare, as are kidney failure, and neurotoxicity. Only venom from neonates contains crotoxin; a constituent typically found in C. durissus venom that produces neurotoxic symptoms.Warrell DA. 2004.

Comstock Publishing Associates, Ithaca and London. 870 pp. 1500 plates. . Taxonomy Previously, until 2004, the description for this form was listed as the nominate subspecies for the tropical rattlesnake, C. durissus. Molecular genetic data suggest the taxa culminatus and tzabcan should be considered as separate species from C. simusW√ºster, W., J.E. Ferguson, J.A. Quijada-Mascare√±as, C.E. Pook, M.G.

History On October 28, 1940, an Otter District Credit Union came into being with the hope of fulfilling the financial needs of those living in the Otter community. A building was obtained on the corner of 40th Avenue and Otter Road, and the branch was soon opened for business. A system was worked out so that the office would be open one evening a month, as farmers were busy farming during the day.Muriel Cluett, \\"Otter District Credit Union,\\" in The Place Between Vol. 2 ed. Aldergrove Heritage Society (Langley: Friesen Co., 2001) In February 1954, members of the Otter District Farmers' Institute (ODFI) applied to start a more stable and consistent Credit Union than was currently available in the Otter District Credit Union. By March, they had incorporated as the Otter Farmers' Institute Credit Union (OFICU), and membership was made available only to those who already held membership at the Otter District Farmers' Institute. The membership fee was soon raised to a dollar from the initial price of twenty-five cents. The Credit Committee was composed of five members and the Board of Directors had seven members including the President. The first elected President was David W. Poppy and a local high school still bears his name. In July 1954, the Credit Union Members held the first Annual General Meeting in Poppy's orchard (what is now Poppy Golf Course). Fifty people were in attendance, though some were only prospective members. That year's profits totaled $86.24 and a percentage was presented to the first secretary/treasurer instead of wages. Only four years later, the OFICU had amassed assets of $100,000 and membership had grown to 300 people. By 1963, membership had surpassed 700. The Langley Credit Union was absorbed into the OFI Credit Union in March 1974 pushing total assets past the 10 million dollar mark. In 1979 (the same year that the ODFI became the Otter Co-op), the OFICU also changed its name to the Aldergrove Credit Union, since the Farmers' Institute had ceased to exist.Lynn Chartrand, \\"O.F.I. Credit Union/Aldergrove Credit Union,\\" in The Place Between Vol. 2 ed. Aldergrove Heritage Society (Langley: Friesen Co., 2001) Ten years after adopting its new name, the Aldergrove Credit Union had grown enough to purchase an insurance company and create Aldergrove Financial Insurance Services. A third branch of the Credit Union was opened in Murrayville in 1994. Most recently, the Matsqui Credit Union was absorbed, pushing Aldergrove Credit Union's assets up to $190 million, its membership to 15,500 and its staff to over 100 people. While remaining a completely separate entity from the Otter Co-op, there is still a Credit Union branch at the Co-op Shopping Centre, and Otter Co-op is the Credit Union's oldest customer.

Gilda Dalla Rizza (12 October 18925 July 1975) was an important Italian soprano. Born in Verona, she made her operatic debut in Bologna (the Teatro Verdi) in 1912, as Charlotte in Werther. Especially acclaimed in the verismo repertory, she was regarded as being Giacomo Puccini's favorite soprano, creating Magda in his La rondine (1917). Although he composed the part of Minnie in La fanciulla del West for another soprano, when Puccini saw Dalla Rizza in the part, he said, \\"Behold, at last I have seen my Fanciulla\\".Colin Kendell, 'The Complete Puccini' Amberley Publishing 2012. She also gave the first European performances of his Suor Angelica and Gianni Schicchi, at Rome in 1919, in the presence of Victor Emmanuel III, King of Italy. He also had her in mind for Li√π in Turandot, though her voice proved too heavy for the part of the young slave-girl by the time of the premiere. Dalla Rizza appeared at the major theatres in Rome, Florence, Turin, S√£o Paulo, Buenos Aires (Teatro Col√≥n), Rio de Janeiro, Verona, Naples, Monte- Carlo, Bologna, Lima, Parma, Santiago, Barcelona, Amsterdam, etc. She never appeared in the United States.  Repertoire  Included in her repertoire were the soprano roles in La fanciulla del West, La forza del destino, Isabeau, Manon Lescaut, La boh√®me (as Mim√¨, opposite Enrico Caruso), La damnation de Faust, Lohengrin, Parisina, Mefistofele (with Feodor Chaliapin), Pagliacci, Iris (with Beniamino Gigli), Der Rosenkavalier (as Octavian, opposite Rosa Ra√Øsa and Amelita Galli-Curci), Cavalleria rusticana, Le prince Igor, Andrea Ch√©nier, Die Meistersinger, Tosca, Siberia, La rondine (with Tito Schipa), Lodoletta, Manon, Falstaff, Suor Angelica, Gianni Schicchi, L'amore dei tre re, Madama Butterfly, Otello, Francesca da Rimini, Il piccolo Marat (world premiere at Rome, 1921, with Hip√≥lito L√°zaro), Giulietta e Romeo (world premiere at Rome, 1922), Louise, La traviata, Tha√Øs, Fedora, Turandot (the title role), Luisa Miller, La vida breve, Adriana Lecouvreur, Arabella (the Italian premiere, 1936, conducted by Richard Strauss), etc. She also sang the soprano solo of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.  La Scala and Covent Garden  At the Teatro alla Scala, from 1915 to 1934, the soprano appeared in Le prince Igor, Andrea Ch√©nier, Isabeau, Siberia, Tosca (directed by Giovacchino Forzano), La traviata (conducted by Arturo Toscanini), Manon Lescaut, Falstaff (with Mariano Stabile), Louise, Francesca da Rimini (with Aureliano Pertile as Paolo), La fanciulla del West, L'amore dei tre re (conducted by Victor de Sabata), Madama Butterfly, La vida breve (Italian premiere, 1934), etc. Dalla Rizza appeared, in 1920, at Covent Garden, in Manon Lescaut, Madama Butterfly, La boh√®me, Suor Angelica, Gianni Schicchi, and Tosca.  Farewell  The singing-actress bade farewell to the stage in 1939, though she returned for a final Suor Angelica, at Vicenza in 1942. In 1926, she married the tenor Agostino Capuzzo (who died in 1963), and, from 1939 to 1955, she taught at Venice's Conservatorio Benedetto Marcello. The prima donna died at Milan's Casa Verdi in 1975. From 1913 to 1928, Dalla Rizza made several recordings, for Columbia and Fonotipia, of excerpts from Faust, I lombardi, La forza del destino, La traviata, Mefistofele, Otello, Andrea Ch√©nier, Isabeau, Cavalleria rusticana, Madama Butterfly, Manon Lescaut, Gianni Schicchi, Tosca, and Manon. In 1931, for Columbia, she participated in the first recording of Fedora. The tenor Giacomo Lauri-Volpi wrote of her in Voci parallele (1955): \\"The voice, characterised by guttural and nasal inflexions, imperfect technically, responded to the demands made of it by the actress, who employed it rather to express the emotions than for purely musical effects.\\"  Bibliography  * Le grandi voci, edited by Rodolfo Celletti (with discography by Raffaele Vegeto), Istituto per la collaborazione culturale - Roma, 1964. * Gilda Dalla Rizza: Verismo e Bel Canto, by F.G.

He was ‚Äî at least in his later life ‚Äî a staunch zelante cardinal who, as Secretary of State under Pope Leo XII, helped enforce an authoritarian regime in the crumbling Papal States. Born in Piacenza into a noble family, della Somaglia was sent to Rome at the young age of twelve and at the Collegio Nazzareno and La Sapienza University acquired degrees in both canon and civil law. In 1769 he became domestic prelate of Pope Clement XIV and under Pope Pius VI he was secretary to numerous curial congregations between 1773 and 1787. Although he was only ordained to the priesthood in 1787, he became titular Patriarch of Antioch the following year and on 1 June 1795 became a cardinal. In his years as a cardinal della Somaglia played an important role as a negotiator with the revolutionary regime in France. Although he undoubtedly agreed with Pius VI's 1791 condemnation of the French Revolution and was expelled from Rome when Napoleon's army invaded in 1808, he was charged with the examination of the concordat with France several years later and this role actually served to taint della Somaglia's reputation in the eyes of fellow zelanti cardinals. From 1814 he was Secretary of the Inquisition and Dean of the College of Cardinals in 1820. In the 1823 conclave, della Somaglia was considered papabile. In 1826 he resigned the post of Secretary of State but continued as Secretary of the Inquisition until his death in 1830. When he died, della Somaglia was the last cardinal still alive elevated by Pius VI. References External links *Salvador Miranda, The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church, Biography.

Crotalus unicolor is a venomous pitviper species found only on the Caribbean island of Aruba, off the coast of Venezuela. Critically endangered, it is estimated that fewer than 230 adults survive in the wild. It is sometimes still classified as a subspecies of Crotalus durissus. Description Moderately sized, this species attains an adult length of approximately 90 cm, and weighs about one kilogram. It is light brown, tan, or almost pink in color, reflecting the soil color of its native habitat, with darker brown diamond-shaped markings, but colors may vary from white to apricot, or brown to slate. The markings are sometimes nearly invisible, or only visible in a narrow stripe down the middle of the back. Geographic range The snakes are endemic to the island of Aruba, off the coast of Venezuela. They exist only in thornscrub and desert habitats on the southeastern half of the island.Campbell JA, Lamar WW. 2004. The Venomous Reptiles of the Western Hemisphere. 2 volumes. Comstock Publishing Associates, Ithaca and London. 870 pp. 1500 plates. . The type locality given is \\"Aruba.\\" Conservation status This species is classified as critically endangered (CR) on the IUCN Red List for the following criteria: C2b (v2.3, 1994). This means that the population is estimated to number less than 250 mature individuals, a continuing decline has been observed, projected, or inferred, in the number of mature individuals, and that the population structure is such that all individuals are in a single subpopulation. Year assessed: 1996. C. d. unicolor in captivity. These snakes are found only on the island of Aruba, where they are mostly limited to the rocky, dry southern tip of the island. Due to their extremely limited geographic range, about 230 animals left in the wild, and the ever encroaching human habitation into their territory (there is only about 25 square kilometers left undeveloped), the Aruba Island rattlesnake is among the rarest rattlesnakes in the world and listed as critically endangered. Unfortunately, while exporting from the island is illegal, it has no other legal protection on the island either. The snake is now a part of the Species Survival Plan for captive breeding. Feeding Its diet consists of rodents, birds and lizards. Reproduction Crotalus unicolor at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium. Males reach sexual maturity in four years; females in five. After a gestation time of four months, females give birth to between five and fifteen live young at a time. References * van Lidth de Jeude, Theodorus Willem. 1887.

History The Bills had cheerleaders in 1960 known simply as the Buffalo Bills Cheerleaders. At the time, they were a group of eight Buffalo State College cheerleaders. They ran this squad until 1965 and went without cheerleaders in 1966. In 1967, the Buffalo Jills were founded and have progressed from a few young women in wool uniforms to a squad of 36 young ladies in more-revealing attire. They have annually sold a swimsuit calendar since the 2000-2001 season and participate in various events in the Western New York area. Troop visits are a regular occurrence as well and a group of eight girls spent February 22 - March 4, 2007, visiting troops in Iraq, the only NFL squad on that tour at the time. In 1986, the Bills discontinued their official ties to the squad and contracted them out to third parties beginning with the fast food chain Mighty Taco. The Bills' continued role (or lack thereof) in employing the squad is currently being disputed in court. In December 2014, Justice Timothy Drury of the New York Supreme Court found that the Bills set the terms of the Jills' contracts and approved them. In 1995, seeking respect and better pay, the Jills formed the first cheerleaders union in the NFL. In 2002, the new director instituted an Ambassador Squad, a group of 8-12 Buffalo Jills who did not dance on the sidelines and field. This was not only to allow the squad to more easily meet the demands of all the public appearances they were asked to make, but allowed more young women to make the squad. The Ambassador Squad Jills became a good way to contribute for young women who either did not have the dancing ability required to make the field, or did not have the free time to attend all of the dance squad practices. In 2006, a pair of Jills swept their first round events in the first year of the NFL Cheerleader Playoffs before falling in the second round. In 2008, the Jills were the first NFL squad to be multi-national, performing at \\"home\\" games both in Orchard Park, New York, and in Toronto, Ontario. =Lawsuit and suspension of operations= Shortly after the squad's 35 members were selected for the 2014 season, a lawsuit was filed on April 22 by five former Jills that alleged the cheerleaders were not paid for hours they worked. Management then responded 2 days later by \\"suspending operations\\" of the cheerleading squad. On July 3, 2014, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell was subpoenaed to testify in the case after a document presented by the Bills in their defense contained his signature. On May 28, 2015 Queens, NY Assemblywoman Nily Rozic introduced a bill in the New York State Assembly to change the New York State labor law to make it clear that professional cheerleaders are employees of the teams for which they cheer. On May 18, 2017, the plaintiffs scored a major victory in their lawsuit as a New York State Court has ruled the Jills to be non-exempt employees, not independent contractors. However, the court denied partial summary judgement as to whether the Bills themselves were their direct employers, and a jury will decide who the employers were unless a settlement is reached. In November 2017, Cumulus Media, who purchased Citadel Broadcasting (one of the primary sponsors of the Jills), entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and in January 2018, the company sought to terminate any remaining Bills-related debts it owed.‚ÄúCumulus Seeks To Cancel WLUP/WKQX LMA Purchase; And Chicago PBP Deals‚Äù from Radio Insight (January 19, 2018) As of June 2019, the lawsuit has yet to be settled.

Overview Kƒ±nalƒ± Kar was a miniseries filmed in Bursa, Turkey from 2002 to 2004. Directed by Taner Akvardar , Kƒ±nalƒ± Kar was a romantic drama about the young teacher Ali from the big city (played by Emrah) whose teaching assignment is given to him in a remote village in Turkey. While it takes some time for Ali to adjust to the village life, he quickly makes some friends. During the early stages of the series, he sees a young girl in the village named Nazar (played by Ozlem Conker), who falls in love with him. Side Plots =The Four Sisters= Nazar, Sumru, Fadik, and Pinar are the four children of Halil Bey and Sureyya Hanim. Nazar is the oldest and the role model. She is the ambassador of the family and the most mature of the girls. Sumru is the next oldest - she is jealous of all the attention that Nazar gets and can't wait for her to get married so she can marry. (In Kinali Kar tradition, marriage rights take precedence with age. The oldest girl marries first, and if she doesn't marry, none of her siblings can marry.) Fadik is the third oldest. She is the funny, quirky, immature, and innocent daughter. She doesn't have any agendas with anybody except Demir. She is madly in love with Demir. Last, but not least, there is Pinar, the youngest daughter. She is the most educated of the daughters and the most mature, next to Nazar. She eventually takes over Ali Ogretmen's post as the village teacher after he dies. =The Extended Family= During Ali's stay in Kinali Kar, this is the family he becomes close with. Omer and Mihriban are brother and sister living in the same house by convenience. Omer is a widower and has a son named Ali. Mihriban is a newlywed living with her husband Recep. Often during the series, Ali would be hanging out here with the family, drinking tea and having conversation. Love Stories =Kamber and Zehra= During the love affair between Ali and Nazar, there are other people involved in relationships. The most famous of these other affairs is the one between Kamber and Zehra. When they were young, Kamber and Zehra were in a relationship that was torn apart. A rich snob from the local town named Davut came into the village and asked for permission from Zehra's parents to marry Zehra. Everything happened really quickly and Kamber couldn't stop the events that took place. Davut whisked away his new bride and moved her to the town with him. As a result, Kamber went crazy - literally. He is the village's most educated person despite his lunacy. He constantly thinks of Zehra and would do anything to get her back. =Mehmet and Pƒ±nar= Two school friends develop a long term long-distance relationship despite Mehmet going away to college and meeting other girls. =Demir and Fadik= Cabbar Aga calls him \\"Yetim Demir\\" (meaning Orphan Demir) as Demir's parents died when he was very little. Fortunately for him, the Bey's family adopted him as one of their own children. Demir actually has a thing for Nazar. But when she marries Cabbar Aƒüa, he gets convinced by Sureyya Hanƒ±m to marry her younger daughter Fadik so that he can start a business with the land he will receive from Halil Bey. She promises him that she will personally give Nazar to him when the time is right. (This never happens, nor was meant to happen.) He reluctantly marries Fadik and eventually learns to love her towards the end of the series. =Kahveci Yusuf and Sumru= These two have a secret love affair that very few people know about. Sumru is a flirty girl who likes the attention that the coffee house owner Yusuf gives her. These two love birds consummate their affair in the barn of Sumru's family. =Mesut and Lamia= Mesut is introduced as a hard-working dependable laborer in Demir's olive oil factory. Lamia is Cabbar Aga's housemaid, who secretly has a crush on Cabbar Aga. Seyit, Cabbar Aga's right- hand man, approaches Mesut and asks him to provide information on what Demir's plans are with the factory. During all this, Mesut meets Cabbar Aga and coincidentally meets Lamia as well. He is instantly mesmerized by her and wants to have a relationship with her. However, she does not find him as interesting as he finds her. Later in the series, when Cabbar Aga marries Lamia, he wants a baby. Ironically, it is Mesut who is \\"hired\\" to provide the seed to impregnate Lamia. When Lamia realizes that Cabbar Aga still loves Nazar, she turns to Mesut and starts to reciprocate the love that he has towards her. Season 1: 2002 - 2003 =The Early Days= Ali Ogretmen comes to the village of Kƒ±nalƒ± Kar for the first time. This is where he first meets Nazar. Ali has some difficulty getting acclimated with the village lifestyle having lived his whole life in Istanbul. He is able to make friends quickly with Kamber, Recep, and √ñmer. Sureyya Hanim is Nazar's mother and at this stage of the miniseries, she is the village's mayor. She is an evil woman who has selfish plans of marrying off her daughters in a way that keeps the maximum amount of land in the family's possession. For Nazar, she plans on giving her to the upper village's mayor (Cabbar Aga) in marriage without her consent. Nazar does not want to marry Cabbar Aga, and to protest this (and delay the eventual marriage) she cuts her hair very short. In Kinali Kar's traditions the marrying girl must have at least shoulder-length hair. Sureyya Hanim sees Ali Ogretmen as a distraction to Nazar and forbids her from seeing him. =The School Fire= To make life difficult for Ali, and perhaps force him to leave the village, she has Kahveci Yusuf set fire on the village's school. The school burns to the ground. Despite this, Ali Ogretmen does not leave the village. He is determined to educate the students of Kinali Kar. As a Teacher's Day present, Kamber, Omer, and Recep build a brand new school for Ali Ogretmen and the children of Kinali Kar. =Cabbar's Evil Plan= Cabbar Aga intends to marry Nazar as soon as possible and wants to force the hand of Sureyya Hanim, so he has his men work day and night and closes down the main river that leads to Kinali Kar from the upper village. Kinali Kar experiences drought-like conditions with no running water. Cabbar Aga states that if Nazar were to come to him, he will open up the river for Kinali Kar. This plan of Cabbar Aga's was absurd and cruel. Nazar would never go - she is in love with Ali Ogretmen. =The Past Returns= Ali's ex-girlfriend Ayca comes in from Istanbul to visit and see what Ali is up to and if he has adjusted to village life. One night they are hanging out in Kamber's shack in the forest, and it gets too late for them to return to the village. At this time, Ali is sick with flu-like conditions and so they are forced to spend the night in Kamber's place. =The Turning Point= In fact, to stay warm, Ayca invites Ali to sleep together in the same bed - so that's what they do. As a coincidence that night, for some reason, Nazar wants to talk with Ali Ogretmen and when she can't find him in his house, she goes out to look for him to Kamber's shack in the forest. When she arrives and opens the door, she is shocked when she sees Ali and Ayca in the same bed! In disgust, she rushes out and runs back to the village, gets on her horse, and rides to the upper village to Cabbar Aga's lair. This changes everything in the series. =Cabbar Aga, Nazar, Ali, and Ece= Ali Ogretmen tries to get Nazar back from the evil clutches of Cabbar Aga, but to no avail. Cabbar organizes a quick wedding and marries Nazar. In fact, Ali shows up uninvited and tries to prevent the whole thing from taking place, but he is too late. After the wedding, Cabbar Aga confesses to Nazar that he is impotent in the honeymoon room. Ali and Nazar secretly meet a few times after the wedding, but it isn't the same as before. During this time, a new character is introduced to the series: Ece, the village doctor played by Sinemis Candemir. She develops a crush for Ali and is jealous of him whenever she hears of the stories of the love between Ali and Nazar. In the season finale, she admits her love for him to his face and asks him to love her, even if it's one one-thousandth times the love he has for Nazar. In the same episode, Nazar announces to Cabbar Aga that she is pregnant from Ali! Season 2: 2003 - 2004 The second season takes place five years after the time from when the first season ended. By this time, Nazar has given birth to a baby boy, Efe and he is about five years old. In the meantime, Ali has married the village doctor, Ece even though his heart still beats for Nazar. In a strange irony, Ali doesn't know that he has a son by Nazar. During the early part of the season, Ali gets into an altercation with his wife and subsequently divorces her. Nazar divorces Cabbar Aga towards the latter stages of the season, and eventually Ali and Nazar reunite and get married. However, in the season finale, during Ali and Nazar's wedding, Cabbar Aga shows up. He shoots and kills Ali to put a sad ending on what would have been a storybook finish. Season 3: 2004 - 2005 Life goes on. Cabbar Aƒüa is in jail, but manages a way to escape. He lives in exile near the hills around Kƒ±nalƒ± Kar. His henchmen help him survive with daily rations of food and water. He wants to exact revenge on Nazar for the divorce and for the time he spent in jail. In the village, Nazar adjusts to a new life without Ali. She has given birth to another boy by Ali, and is now a single mother of two. A new dam construction project will begin in Kƒ±nalƒ± Kar that has brought to the village new characters. Among these is the engineer who has an interest in Nazar. Unfortunately for him, she is not interested in him and as a result, a relationship does not blossom. Regardless, the engineer protects her from Cabbar Aƒüa's attacks. Later on, Cabbar Aƒüa commits suicide on a snowy hill outside of Kƒ±nalƒ± Kar and Kamber and Zehra get married.

He was selected by the Cleveland Indians of the American League in the 14th round of the 1977 amateur draft, and made his major league debut on June 9, . While Rhomberg's career consisted of just 41 games (his final game was on June 5, ) he batted an impressive .383 with an on-base percentage of .423. Not known for his defense, Rhomberg was considered primarily an outfielder. Rhomberg was known not just for his hitting, but also for his compulsions. His main compulsion was the need to touch back someone who had just touched him. Early life Rhomberg was born and raised in Dubuque, Iowa, where his father worked for a meatpacking company. He played basketball and baseball in high school and led his baseball team to the school's first state championship. It was during high school that he met Denice, his future wife. In 1974, Rhomberg attended Lewis University in Illinois where he was a part of the NAIA World Series Championship baseball team. In 1976 he transferred to the University of St. Francis, where he was selected in the 1977 draft by the Cleveland Indians. Playing career By 1981, Rhomberg was playing with the Class AA Chattanooga Lookouts of the Southern League. That year he led the Southern League in hits (187), triples (14), stolen bases (74), batting average (.366) and on-base percentage (.457); he finished second in runs scored (104). After the 1981 season, the Indians traded second baseman Duane Kuiper to the San Francisco Giants for pitcher Ed Whitson. Indians vice president Phil Seghi named Rhomberg as one of two players likely to become the starting second baseman on the 1982 Indians. Rhomberg spent most of the 1982 season in Class AAA, and he was called up to the major leagues with the Indians in September of that year. In his major league debut on September 8, which Rhomberg said was the first birthday of his son Kevin Jr, Rhomberg hit a home run. Several players shared the second base duties that year for the Indians; Rhomberg appeared in 16 games, mostly as a left fielder or pinch runner. Before the 1983 season, the Indians sent Rhomberg back to the Class AAA Charleston Charlies. He was called back up to the Indians in September 1983. He finished his major league career with the 1984 Indians, playing in 13 games. Over his 41-game major league career, Rhomberg had 18 hits in 47 at bats for a .383 batting average. He retired after spending the 1985 season in Class AAA with the Phoenix Giants. Cleveland teammates, including former player and manager Mike Hargrove, called Rhomberg, \\"Touch Me, Touch Me\\", and it is reported that opposing players and teammates, loved nothing more than to touch Rhomberg and then run off, sending him into a near panic. According to one story, former Indians teammate Rick Sutcliffe once reached under a bathroom stall to touch Rhomberg on the toe. Not knowing who the culprit was, Rhomberg went around the clubhouse and touched each player. Brook Jacoby tagged Rhomberg with a ball in the minors, then threw it out of the stadium. Jacoby said that Rhomberg spent two hours looking for the ball before finding it. An umpire once halted play during a game in New York to tell Yankees players to stop touching Rhomberg. If a person eluded his return touch, Rhomberg would send a letter that said, \\"This constitutes a touch.\\" Post-playing career Following his playing career, Rhomberg was a scout for the Cleveland Indians. He spent most of the 1990s as a college baseball head coach, first at Cleveland State University and then at Lakeland Community College. Since then he has owned, operated, and consulted for minor league baseball clubs. Rhomberg lives in Ohio and owns the Lorain County Ironmen, a team in the Great Lakes Summer Collegiate League, a wood-bat league that gives college players the chance to play during the college off-season. The Ironmen are managed by Rhomberg's close friend, former Cleveland Indians teammate Joe Charboneau. Rhomberg's son, Joe Rhomberg, is also a member of the Ironmen coaching staff. The team plays its home games at the Pipe Yard in Lorain, Ohio. Rhomberg was named one of the Top 10 Most Superstitious Athletes by Men's Fitness.

The play is the second in The Talley Trilogy, between his plays Talley & Son and Fifth of July. Set in an boathouse near rural Lebanon, Missouri in 1944, it is a romantic comedy following the characters Matt Friedman and Sally Talley as they settle their feelings for each other. Wilson received the 1980 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for the work. The play is unlike Wilson's other works, taking place in one act with no intermission, set in ninety-seven minutes of real time, with no set change. Plot summary Talley's Folly depicts one night in the lives of two unlikely sweethearts, Matt Friedman and Sally Talley. The one-act play takes place in a boathouse on the Talley farm in Missouri on the Fourth of July, 1944. The play opens with Matt directly addressing the audience, telling them that the play will take ninety-seven minutes and he hopes to relay his story properly in that time. Taking the time to point out some staging elements, he tells the audience that the gazebo-like structure next to him is a Victorian boathouse, which has fallen into disrepair. While on vacation in Lebanon, Missouri the previous summer, Matt met Sally and has sent her a letter every day since. Though the single reply from Sally gave him no hope for romantic encouragement, he has returned to ask her to marry him. Sally arrives at the boathouse and is in disbelief that Matt has shown up uninvited, even though he had written her that he planned to come for the holiday. Matt's arrival has created a stir in Sally's conservative Protestant household, where a Jewish man is not welcomed, especially when his intentions are to court their daughter, who is eleven years younger than he. Matt's interest in Sally had never waned. He once drove from his home in St. Louis to the hospital where she worked and waited hours for her, even after being informed that she was not available. The conversation turns to the boathouse structure. Sally tells him it was constructed by her uncle, who built follies all over town. Her uncle did only what he wanted to do, and Sally considers him the healthiest member of the family for his courage. Eventually, the couple begins to reminisce about the night they met and the time they spent together the previous summer. Matt takes it as a positive sign that she has changed into a nice dress before coming to see him tonight. Sally's protests do not match her behavior and he pushes forward. She is the most intriguing woman he has ever met, and he is determined to make her his wife. Admitting that he has called Sally's aunt every two weeks during the past year, Matt reveals that he knows Sally was fired from a Sunday school teaching job. Apparently, she had been encouraging the students to read Thortstein Veblen's The Theory of the Leisure Class in addition to the Methodist reader. The rise of labor unions was affecting the families of the children in her class and she felt obligated to help educate them. Her unorthodox methods earned her the consternation of the church elders as well as her own family, who own the garment factory on which the labor issue centered. Sally then tries to glean some information about Matt's background, a subject about which he is very guarded. He finally admits to Sally that he was probably born in Kaunas, Lithuania. His father had been an engineer. In 1911, his father was overheard in a French cafe discussing his work with nitrogen, a reference to the Haber process developed in 1909 by a Jewish-German chemist, Fritz Haber, to extract nitrogen from the air, which made the manufacture of gunpowder and fertilizer inexpensive. The family was later detained as they were attempting to cross the border. Matt's father and older sister were tortured until the French realized that the father had no information of any value to them. In the meantime, the sister had fallen into a coma from which she never awoke. They later went to the German authorities and were again detained. Matt escaped to America through the help of some relatives. Haunted by his childhood grief, Matt vowed never to bring another child into the world. He was content with his life until he met Sally. He now feels forever changed and hopeful for the first time in his life. Having risked the vulnerability of revealing his background, Matt presses Sally to share why she, a beautiful 31-year-old woman, has never married. She diverts the conversation to economics, which frustrates Matt. Sally finally reveals her disappointment in love many years ago, which makes her reluctant to fall in love again. Her family had partnered her with Harley Campbell, whose family was also wealthy. The match was supposedly made in heaven, especially for the business interests of the two families. Sally had been a cheerleader and Harley had been a basketball star. Unfortunately, the families' fortunes waned during the Depression. In addition, Sally was struck with tuberculosis and sequestered for a long time. A pelvic infection left her barren, and Harley's family no longer condoned their marriage. Matt comments on the irony of their situation, that he'd been lamenting over the fact that he was in love with a woman but could never have children and now this woman presents him with the same situation. He believes that an angel has guided his path to her. Sally agrees to marry him and move to St. Louis, and they vow to return to the boathouse every year so they don't forget where they fell in love.

The scale was first developed in 1982 by J.A. Yesavage and others.Yesavage JA, Brink TL, Rose TL, et al. Development and validation of a geriatric depression screening scale: a preliminary report. J Psychiatr Res. 1982-83;17(1):37-49. Description In the Geriatric Depression Scale, questions are answered \\"yes\\" or \\"no.\\" A five- category response set is not utilized in order to ensure that the scale is simple enough to be used when testing ill or moderately cognitively impaired individuals, for whom a more complex set of answers may be confusing, or lead to inaccurate recording of responses. The GDS is commonly used as a routine part of a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment. One point is assigned to each answer and the cumulative score is rated on a scoring grid. The grid sets a range of 0-9 as \\"normal\\", 10-19 as \\"mildly depressed\\", and 20-30 as \\"severely depressed\\". A diagnosis of clinical depression should not be based on GDS results alone. Although the test has well-established reliability and validity evaluated against other diagnostic criteria, responses should be considered along with results from a comprehensive diagnostic work-up. A short version of the GDS (GDS-SF) containing 15 questions has been developed,Sheikh JI, Yesavage JA. Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS): recent evidence and development of a shorter version. Clin Gerontol. 1986 June;5(1/2):165-173. and the scale is available in languages other than English. The conducted research found the GDS-SF to be an adequate substitute for the original 30-item scale.Lesher EL, Berryhill JS. Validation of the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form among inpatients. J Clin Psychol. 1994 Mar;50(2):256-60. The GDS was validated against Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRS-D) and the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS). It was found to have a 92% sensitivity and an 89% specificity when evaluated against diagnostic criteria.Yesavage JA, Brink TL, Rose TL, et al. Development and validation of a geriatric depression screening scale: a preliminary report. J Psychiatr Res. 1982-83;17(1):37-49. Scale questions and scoring The scale consists of 30 yes/no questions. Each question is scored as either 0 or 1 points.

White, Site Analysis: Diagramming Information for Architectural Design, Architectural Media Ltd, 1983G.Z. Brown, Sun, Wind, and Light, architectural design strategies, John Wiley & Sons, 1985 The result of this analytic process is a summary, usually a graphical sketch, which sets in relation the relevant environmental information with the morphology of the site in terms of parcel, topography, and built environment. This result is then used as a starting point for the development of environment-related strategies during the design process. A number of graphical tools for site analysis have been developed to assist designers in this task. Examples of traditional climate-related site analysis tools are the Sundial, the Sun Path Diagram,http://wiki.naturalfrequency.com/wiki/Sun-Path_Diagram the Radiation Square,M. DeKay & G.Z. Brown, Sun Wind & Light, architectural design strategies, 3rd ed. Wiley, 2014 the Wind Rose, and the Wind Square. These conventional methods of site analysis are efficient in simple sites with irrelevant close obstructions, where the analysis can be reduced to the parcel at the ground level or even exclusively to its center point. More elaborated techniques, like Volumetric Site Analysis,Michele Leidi, Volumetric site analysis for the conceptualization of architecture in the urban context, ETH- Z√ºrich, 2014J. Teller & S. Azar, Townscope II ‚Äê A computer system to support solar access decision making, Solar Energy, p. 187‚Äì200, 2001Andrew Marsh, The Interaction of Radiance and Ecotect, 2006 can instead be used to study more intricate and obstructed sites like those of high and dense urban settings. Process  As described by Edward T. White the site design process is divided up into three sections; research phase, analysis phase, and synthesis phase. These three phases are divided into the eight chronological steps in the design process. * Research phase: The first step is defining the problem and its definition. This is part of the research phase. The site design and site planning process begins with the initial problem to be solved. This is started by a client contracting a planner to work with a particular site. * Analysis phase: The next step involves programming the site as well as site and user analysis, which is focused on in-depth below. There are numerous site elements related to the analysis during this phase. This is part of the analysis phase in site planning. * Synthesis phase: From the analysis, a program is developed, which is part of the synthesis phase. The third step deals with schematic design of a site plan as well as a preliminary cost estimate for the site. Step four involves more developed designs and a detailed cost estimate. Step five is the construction documents or the plan. Bidding and contracting for the project follows as step six. Construction then will take place as step seven. The final step, step eight, in the site design process is occupation and management of the site.  Elements  Numerous elements go into a given site analysis. These elements include location, neighborhood context, site and zoning, legal elements, natural physical features, man-made features, circulation, utilities, sensory, human and cultural, and climate components. The following elements typically are considered in most sites: =Location= The site should be related to major streets or landmarks previously existing. Aerial photographs help in this assessment stage. There should be documentation of distances and time from major places. This should be completed by either driving or walking the distance first-hand. = Neighborhood context = Zoning of the neighborhood is important and information of this type can typically be found at the municipal planning department of the site. Numerous issues at this stage require direct observation. Features of this sort include architectural patterns, street lighting, and condition of existing buildings. This would also include the immediate surroundings of the site. The reaction of the surrounding buildings towards the site and people moving around should be analysed. Other important components of the neighborhood context include an analysis of existing paths (pedestrian, cyclist, and vehicle), landmarks and nodes. Landmarks are distinctive sites that provide way-finding for people in the area, and which define the character of a neighborhood. Nodes are key public gathering places that encourage people to linger and socialize. = Site and zoning = Site boundaries can be located by either verifying the dimensions physically or contacting the county tax assessor‚Äôs office. Zoning classifications, set-backs, height restrictions, allowable site coverage, uses, and parking requirements are obtained by obtaining zoning classifications from a zoning map, which can be located from the city planning department.\\\\\\\\\\\\ * Infrastructure, social, and political boundaries. = Legal = Typical legal information can be obtained from the deed to the property. The deed is held by the owner of the title insurance company. In the deed is information such as the property description, present ownership, and the governmental jurisdiction the site is located in, and the city or county. = Natural physical features= Most of this information will be derived from the topographic features on the site. A contour map of this magnitude can be located from the survey engineer. Drainage problems as well as existing natural features of trees, ground cover, ground texture, and soil conditions on the site should be directly observed. = Man made features = Features located on the site such as buildings, walls, fences, patios, plazas, bus stop shelters should be noted. The site and location of such features should be directly measured. Documentation of existing historical districts should be made, some of which may already have reports completed. Locating this information can be done through the municipal planning department for the site. = Circulation = The uses of streets, roads, alleys, sidewalks, and plazas are important in this inventory step. It is not necessarily an analysis of these elements but more an analysis of what occurs on these circulation gateways. = Utilities = Information for utilities concerning the site can be found through the utility departments and companies in the local area. Generally, the company has a print of the drawing of this information needed. Information in this print includes the location of all utilities and their locations around or on the site itself. = Sensory = Much of the sensory information collected will be done through first hand experience. The information is obtained from sketching and photographs (sometimes aerial photographs). Direct observation of other sensory elements of noise, odors, smoke, and pollutant areas must also be completed. = Human and cultural = This information can be obtained through census statistics on the neighborhood. Information regarding these statistics is available from the local municipal planning agency. This information includes activities among people on the site and their relationships to these activities. = Climate = This information can be obtained through the local weather service or any third party services such as Data Pot (httpd://datapot.io). Conditions such as rainfall, snowfall, humidity, and temperature over months must be considered and analyzed. The sun-path and vertical sun angles throughout an entire year are important to note.

Her counterpart in the UK version is Jennifer Taylor-Clarke. She is portrayed by Melora Hardin. She is the Vice President of Northeast Sales at the paper distribution company Dunder Mifflin, directly supervising central character and Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin's Scranton branch, Michael Scott. Her character is notable for the dysfunctional relationship she enters with Michael following the second-season episode, \\"The Client\\", until the fourth-season episode \\"Dinner Party\\". Michael and Jan's personas contrast to much humor in the series, particularly in their professional attitudes and social interactions, although Jan's erratic and sexually-domineering state of mind leads to her firing. Biography Jan Levinson-Gould, as Vice President of Sales at Dunder Mifflin, has a no- nonsense management style that is at odds with Michael's more casual approach. Since her office is in New York, Jan's contact with the Scranton branch is largely by telephone, although she will make the two-and-a-half-hour drive to Scranton if necessary. She usually asks if she's on camera when talking to Michael on the speaker phone, and Michael often lies and tells her she is not, before admitting that they are‚Äîat which point she hangs up on him. While initially based on Jennifer Taylor-Clarke from the UK version, her character develops in a different direction. In a deleted scene from \\"Dinner Party\\", it is implied that Jan grew up in West Virginia. The \\"Serenity by Jan\\" website indicates that she had an unhappy childhood and ran away from home, and she once said that her family refused to speak to her anymore \\"on advice of counsel\\". She initially drives a Volvo S80 and Volvo S60, and trades it in with Michael's Sebring for a shared Porsche Boxster. However, she is seen in season five with a Toyota Highlander. She smokes in stressful situations and indulges in self-destructive tendencies with poor judgment in spite of her inherent competence and professional attitude. She demonstrates a strong and often fetishist sexuality which sometimes intimidates Michael, such as when he revealed in \\"Women's Appreciation\\" that Jan did not always abide by their safety word \\"foliage\\". It is implied that she may have taken the virginity of her assistant, Hunter, of whom Michael is jealous. Jan has also been shown to be rather vain, creating musical media to supposedly express love for Astrid but rather seems an attempt to flaunt her performance skills, whilst also acting smug about her parenting in Pam's presence.

Michael, despite urgings from all women in the Scranton office (except Meredith, from whom Michael declined to seek advice) to the contrary, and in his amazement at Jan's breast augmentation, agrees to get back together with Jan. Unfortunately, the corporate position for which Michael, Jim, and Karen are interviewing is Jan's; after being absent from work, abusing corporate policies, and being in Scranton far too often, Jan is fired and escorted from the building in New York, and is replaced by Ryan Howard (B.J.

Her heedless spending combined with his own poor financial sense rapidly drain Michael's resources, leading to a brief scheme in which Michael attempts to escape his troubles by leaving town but is stopped by Jan who (in a very rare warm and positive moment in their relationship) tells Michael that she stands by him despite her earlier treatment of Michael and that she has come to see him as \\"someone worth standing by\\". She also sues Dunder Mifflin, claiming wrongful dismissal, largely over her breast implants, although Michael is betrayed by Jan, who uses his private diary as evidence that the company mistreats its employees, and also learning that she gave him a scathing performance review while they were dating.

Michael goes to her Lamaze classes when Jan asks him to (where he apparently annoyed the teacher) and is incredibly excited to be there for the birth of \\"their\\" child. However, he is utterly deflated when Jan gives birth to her daughter Astrid without him there, and when Jan reluctantly lets Michael spend time around her, Michael sadly recognizes that he feels no connection at all to Astrid and that he is no longer holding onto feelings for Jan. Jan also insists Michael not go out with Holly, leading Michael to promptly and successfully ask Holly out on a date. =Seasons 7‚Äì9= Jan is not seen again until the seventh season, by which time she is employed as a hospital administrator, raises Astrid as a single mother and has recorded a Doris Day cover album. She tells Michael at great length that they were never a good couple and she was slumming by ever dating him; an angry Michael shocks her by saying (wrongly as it turned out) that he has herpes, and later expresses disbelief that he thought she could have been \\"the one\\". She reappeared on the show in a cameo scene in Michael's self-produced movie \\"Threat Level Midnight\\", playing a covert agent jazz singer named Jasmine Windsong who slips key information to Agent Michael Scarn and gets killed by an assassin. When the documentary crew approaches Jan about the movie, she pretends to be proud of Michael's finished film, and looks disgusted as she makes a hasty attempt to get her dry cleaning into her car and get away from both the cameras and any mention of Michael. Jan did not appear in the eighth season. In the ninth-season episode \\"The Whale\\", Jan is now back in Scranton, working as an executive at the White Pages phone book company. Dwight and Pam make the sales call in her office, initially unaware that she is the contact. Jan had no intention of giving Dunder Mifflin her business, and had intended to refuse David Wallace (now the owner and CEO of Dunder Mifflin) personally in retaliation for firing her several years before, and was dismayed when Dwight and Pam arrived instead. Nevertheless, Dwight keeps her from refusing by assigning Customer Service representative Clark Green (Clark Duke) as her personal liaison. The two hit it off and travel abroad for several weeks. In \\"Suit Warehouse\\", Clark returns to the office, having gotten Jan to sign on as a client after spending several weeks in Europe as her lover. He compared sex with Jan to sex with \\"a swarm of bees... bees that just find something wrong with every hotel room.\\" Jan also sent an expensive Italian-made espresso machine back with Clark as a gift to the staff. In Jan's final appearance on the show (over the phone) \\"Couples Discount\\", Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) (now the Scranton regional manager), points out that Dwight had offered a discounted price without getting Andy's approval (something that would've been impossible for Dwight to do, as Andy himself was abroad at the time), and attempted to renegotiate Dunder Mifflin's contract with the White Pages. Infuriated, Jan proceeds to terminate her contract with Dunder Mifflin altogether. In \\"Finale\\", it is mentioned that Dwight (who succeeded Andy as regional manager) managed to reacquire the White Pages' business by again offering the discounted price. Jan is not referenced over the course of the documentary's TV release and is not invited to any of the events connected to it.

He is the former Dean of St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary, where he is currently the Director of the Master of Theology Program and the Father Georges Florovsky Distinguished Professor of Patristics. He was ordained to the diaconate on September 8, 2001 and the priesthood on September 14, 2001. He is the editor of the Patristic Series released by St. Vladimir's Press. He was elected dean of the seminary on November 18, 2006, and served as dean from 2007 until 2017, when he was named Father Georges Florovsky Distinguished Professor of Patristics.Announcement of election  Biography  Behr (left) at the International Foundation for the Unity of Orthodox Christian Nations award Behr completed his undergraduate studies at Thames Polytechnic, London, in 1987. His Bachelor of Arts dissertation was entitled \\"Of God, Man, and Creation: A Comparative Study of the Anthropology of the Greek Fathers and Emmanuel Levinas\\". Having studied under Bishop Kallistos Ware, Behr earned his Master of Philosophy degree in 1991 and Doctor of Philosophy degree in theology from Oxford University in 1995. Remnants of his master's thesis, \\"Sexuality, Marriage, and Asceticism in Second-Century Christian Writings\\", are found in his doctoral dissertation published in 2000 by Oxford University Press under the title Asceticism and Anthropology in Irenaeus and Clement. Behr completed a Master of Theology degree from St Vladimir's in 1997. His thesis, a complete textual criticism of On the Apostolic Preaching by Irenaeus of Lyons, was subsequently published by St. Vladimir's Seminary Press. Behr has been Distinguished Lecturer at the Fordham University Theology Faculty, Visiting Professor of Historical Theology at the Nashotah House Theological Seminary, adjunct lecturer and faculty member of the St. Athanasius College which specialises in Coptic Orthodox theological studies. In September 2019, he was also appointed as professor in divinity at the Aberdeen University's School of Divinity, History and Philosophy. Behr is married to a teacher of English and is the father of two sons and a daughter. at minute 1:13.  Works  = The Way to Nicaea = Behr's first major work, The Way to Nicaea, published in 2001, follows early Christian reflection beginning with the Scriptural Christ and continuing through to the Council of Antioch. This first of three volumes primarily consist of the examination of certain theologians: Ignatius, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus of Lyons, Hippolytus of Rome and the Roman Debates, Origen and Alexandria, and Paul of Samosata and the Council of Antioch. In his second volume, Behr provides a short biographical sketch of each, and then focuses on their works and the controversies they were engaged in. Neither a comprehensive history of theology nor a compendium of Christian doctrine, Behr instead draws attention to the theological debates and reflections that led up to the First Council of Nicaea. Because the answer to a question can only be provided by its meaning, Behr begins with the question Christ himself asks, \\"Who do you say I am?\\" This answer, while provided by the Gospel, requires reflection‚Äîinterpretation and explanation of this very person of Jesus Christ, his life and works. The writings of the New Testament, written from an interpretative confession of the crucified and risen Christ contemplated through Scripture, were the subject of intense debate and formation, eventually finding their normative foundation by the end of the 2nd century. According to Behr, this background is not only necessary for understanding later theological debates, but it is crucial to understanding those boundaries that identify Jesus Christ. It is the unique Jesus Christ-crucified on a cross, buried, risen three days later- contemplated through the texture of Scripture-the Law, the Psalms, and the Prophets-who is revealed as the Son of God. The incarnation, then, is not the single moment in which something began but rather a recapitulation‚Äîthe same presence of the same word. It is through the Word of God previously hidden in the Scripture, as preached by the Apostles, revealed by the Holy Spirit, that the invisible, incomprehensible Father is made visible and comprehensible by the crucified and risen Jesus Christ. It is he who is always the Coming One, whom through continual contemplation and immersion in Scripture, devotion and death in his name, allows us to participate in the fullness of God. = The Nicene Faith = Released in 2004, The Nicene Faith examines the theological reflection of the 4th century, beginning with the church shaking debates that led to Council of Nicaea and ending with their resolution at the Council of Constantinople. Like its predecessor, The Nicene Faith is structured not only chronologically, but according theme, examining of only certain theologians- Athanasius, Basil of Cesarea, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Gregory of Nyssa. Adapting a similar approach to The Way to Nicaea, this volume is neither a complete collection of theological discourses nor does it have a sole focus, such as Trinitarian theology. Rather, The Nicene Faith traces the development of theological reflection in the 4th century‚ÄîAthanasius and the Cappadocians expounding their vision, preparing the path for the councils of Nicaea and Constantinople, providing the proper context in which their creeds can be correctly understood. One simply cannot reduce the results of these debates into shorthand formulae. Key to understanding Behr's approach, the introduction, standing outside of the main body of work, explains the need to scrutinize our inherently flawed perspectives and presuppositions regarding 4th century theology. An awareness of this 21st century understanding of such terms as \\"orthodoxy\\", \\"incarnation\\", and \\"Trinitarian\\" theology recognizes that we speak these terms with 1,600 years of definitions already read into them, rather than how the authors themselves used these words within their own texts. The Nicene Faith both discusses and reflects upon Athanasius and the Cappadocians‚Äô exegetical principles and subsequently derived theology, specifically within the context of the controversies upon which this was forced. Thus, leading to a further, more carefully worded engagement with Scripture, once again seeking to answer the same question that led the way to Nicaea, Christ's ‚ÄúWho do you say that I am?‚Äù Nicene faith is, then, a particular confession, revealing the power of God, responding to Christ and the Spirit, concerning the God whom they reveal as the Father. It is the transformation fashioned in and by Christ that propels all theological contemplation. It provides the lens through which one understands his Passion. When Christ dies as a human being, he demonstrates his divinity as God‚Äîhe raises his own body. God's power is found in human weakness‚Äîthe form of a servant transforms into the form of the Lord‚Äîrevealing not inferiority but true divinity and equality. It is as the crucified one that glory is both received and revealed‚Äîthe same glory which he shared with the Father from all eternity, by which there is no other. This revelation, the cornerstone of all Christian theology, through which God is made known, is located solely on the Cross. The one who was creator is the one who now renews. It is the Passion, the mystery of the Incarnation of the Word of God, illumined by and through the Cross, Christ's voluntary bodily death and resurrection, through which those who have put on his faith, now live in Christ and continue to demonstrate his victory. = The Mystery of Christ = The Mystery of Christ is a systematic presentation of theology that emerged from Behr's first two volumes, The Way to Nicaea and The Nicene Faith. A break from The Formation of Christian Theology series, the book provides a vision of Christian theology that challenges the reader to rethink the modern historical approach to theology‚Äîa discipline that has become ever more fragmented in its study. Once again returning to the earlier witnesses, Behr begins with the way in which the disciples came to know Jesus Christ as the Son of God‚Äîthrough the Cross and the manner in which the Passion was interpreted and proclaimed. This revelation does not occur in light of the Passion, but when the risen Christ himself directs the disciples to the scriptures. The text of the Old Testament, previously viewed as a narrative of the past, is revealed as a thesaurus of imagery, with the historical event of the Passion as its starting point. It is Christ, not scripture, who is exegeted. The crucified and risen Lord standing before them is the one of whom the scriptures have always spoken‚Äî the one who is still the Coming One. Given this perspective, Behr continues by explaining how the results of the theological debates of the first four centuries‚Äîparticularly Trinitarian theology and Christology‚Äîhave become separated from the way in which they were exegetically formed and articulated. Within this structure he considers questions of canon and tradition. How is it that we speak of creation and salvation today? How is the ‚ÄúFall‚Äù (mis)understood? This is crucial, not only regarding the narrative of salvation history, but more importantly how we understand our own lives. Additionally, Behr examines how Mary is spoken of in the Gospels and liturgical texts‚Äîboth the nativity and the Virgin Mother as the church. Finally, he focuses on theme of incarnation, which upon interpretation presents the body as that through which Christians are to glorify God. In the carefully worded postscript, Behr provides further attention to modern theology's paradigmatic shift away from the exegetical methods from which early Christian doctrine was originally elaborated. Today's starting points are conclusions without arguments that have resulted in ambiguity. Much of our theology now works within a modern historical framework, recounting the interaction between God as Trinity and the world. With a Trinity as a starting point, the linear movement proceeds to retell the creation story, our time in Eden, and the Fall of Man as a historical moment in history. Thus begins salvation history, the second person of the Trinity‚Äîthe pre-incarnate Logos‚Äîrevealing himself to Abraham, conversing with Moses, and speaking through the Prophets. This culminates in the incarnation of one of the Trinity, who then returns to the Father, sends the Holy Spirit to guide the church for the rest of humankind until the second coming, which is the literal, definable end of the time-line. This popular modern trend which seeks the reality of history‚Äîhow things really occurred as a neutral statement‚Äîignores the recognition that history is an interpretation of past events. Instead of interpretation and confession, theology has become a fusion of metaphysics and mythology.

Flenderson is a fictional character on the U.S. comedy television series The Office. He is portrayed by Paul Lieberstein, who was also the show's writer, director, producer and showrunner. He is the human resources representative at the Scranton branch of the paper distribution company, Dunder Mifflin. Toby is an original character with no counterpart in the original British series. Overview Toby H. Flenderson is the human resources representative for the Scranton branch of paper distributor Dunder Mifflin/Sabre. Mild-mannered to the point of being physically incapable of voicing his opinions or asserting himself, Toby can be somewhat mournful about his life choices (he fell into the field of Human Resources after leaving his training at seminary in order to pursue the woman he would later marry and painfully divorce). He likes his colleagues, although he is sometimes exasperated by the excessively chatty Kelly Kapoor. He also has a long- standing crush on Pam Beesly, which he almost reveals at the end of Season 4 when he resigns from his position to move to Costa Rica. Toby was intensely despised by branch manager Michael Scott, largely because Michael had no authority over him as Toby reported to corporate headquarters, and because Toby frequently tried to dissuade Michael from many of his ill-conceived and impulsive ideas. Michael sums up his feelings for Toby in the episode \\"Casino Night\\", asking, \\"Why are you the way that you are? Honestly every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be.\\" For Toby's going away party in \\"Goodbye Toby\\", Michael gives him as a gift a rock with a note attached reading \\"Suck on This!\\" Shortly after arriving in Costa Rica, Toby suffers a zip-line accident and midway through season 5, he returns to his old job at Dunder Mifflin, much to Michael's fury. Biography In his childhood, Toby was forced to testify against both of his parents when the two got divorced. He attended Bishop O'Hara High School and is a Penn State University alumnus. In the Season 5 episode \\"Casual Friday\\", a diploma at his cubicle reveals Toby also has a B.S. in psychology from California Coastal College. The Season 7 episode \\"Counseling\\" reveals he has a degree in social work from Temple University. Toby was in a seminary for a year but dropped out when he met his future wife. The two moved to Scranton and had a daughter named Sasha. They later divorced. Toby loves his daughter and went the extra mile in \\"Moroccan Christmas\\" to buy her one of Dwight's Princess Unicorn dolls from Darryl Philbin, noting that his ex-wife \\"will be so pissed\\" and that \\"for once, Daddy's going to be a hero.\\" However Darryl bought an African-American doll. When Darryl asks if the doll is okay, Toby says \\"It's even better than the one I wanted.\\" Toby claims to have no \\"passion for HR\\" and was only hired at Dunder Mifflin as it was the first job he could find. He joins the others occasionally but only for business matters, such as reviewing the company's sexual harassment policy and mediating conflict between employees. Toby prefers to let angry employees vent to him, after which they feel better and the conflict eventually settles down and solves itself. This strategy worked virtually trouble-free for years until Michael Scott publicly reads off all listed complaints. Toby tries (but usually fails) to enforce corporate policies and rules when Michael disregards them, typified by an incident in which he quashes Michael's plan to invite Boy Scouts to a Casino Night party: Toby usually avoids office activities whenever possible and, like most of the staff, only tolerates Michael. He has reached out to Michael several times despite Michael's continued abuse. He gets along with the rest of the staff. When Dwight approached Michael about missing a gift bag during \\"A Benihana Christmas\\", Michael suggested stealing it from Toby, much to Toby's later chagrin, as all the office staff had new robes except for him (Pam later gave her robe to Toby, and this increased Toby's unrequited crush on her). Michael on numerous occasions attempts to blame Toby for problems that are clearly his own fault such as in \\"The Merger\\" in which he questions Tony Gardner if he is quitting because of Toby. In \\"Classy Christmas\\" Michael vandalizes Holly's Woody doll (a gift from her boyfriend) and tries to convince her Toby did it. Toby denies it and says the vandalism is something Michael would do. He seems to have plain bad luck in many instances and seems to accept this way of life as inescapable, which may be the cause of his sad disposition. On some occasions, Toby enjoys some rewards and good fortune, much to his satisfaction (and to Michael's annoyance). Toby's favorite movies are Say Anything..., The Shining, Annie Hall, and Toy Story 2. He also likes short stories, mystery novels, and \\"old hard-boiled detective\\" movies. One of his favorite TV shows is Damages. He lived in Honolulu for a year and stated in \\"Branch Closing\\" that he would take severance from the closing, sell his house, and move to Costa Rica. In \\"Local Ad\\", it is revealed that he worked in advertising for three years before coming to Dunder Mifflin. According to a deleted scene from the episode \\"Launch Party\\", he is colorblind. Toby is also allergic to mushrooms (\\"Survivor Man\\"). Toby has an ongoing concern about the air quality at the office that borders on an obsession. He worked a recommendation that the air be tested into his goodbye toast in a deleted scene from \\"Goodbye, Toby;\\" he ignored the two factions that wanted to use an unexpected surplus for new chairs or a new copier and said the money should go to air testing; and he put together a meeting to discuss the radon testing kits he was dispersing in \\"The Chump.\\" Relationships Toby is seen as an awkward and quiet guy in the office. He is often passive when he is teased or when he gets picked on and does not appear to know how to stand up for himself. While members of the office have shown disgust at Michael's treatment of Toby, for unknown reasons, nobody has ever stood up for Toby when Michael insults him or excludes him from events, but he is generally liked in the office. The others possibly avoid standing up for him as Michael has authority over them (unlike Toby) and could potentially punish them for speaking up or possibly because they do not want to suffer the same treatment Toby suffers from Michael. Toby, however, has never asked anyone for help when Michael mistreats him, which is possibly the reason why no one ever stands up for him. Besides Michael, the other staff members treat Toby with respect. For example, after Toby conducts a brief sexual harassment seminar, the staff is left in a good mood and laughing, until Michael comes in and takes over. Others have become annoyed with Toby occasionally, but overall he is well-respected and considered one of the more intelligent people in the office. His behavior does change somewhat when he meets Nellie (whom he develops a romance for), and he is shown to become somewhat of nuisance to her by being socially awkward and not handling his crush on her with any subtlety (and also an annoyance to Andy, though this is more of a Michael Scott-like situation where Andy gets angry and frustrated at Toby for doing his HR job at the expense of Andy's weirder/less legal ideas). =Michael= Michael despises Toby because, according to Michael, his job is to \\"make the office fun, while [Toby's] job is to make the office lame.\\" Michael's often-successful self-delusions that he is the life of the party frequently have a light shined on them by Toby's interactions with him. This is usually not Toby's intention, but his inability to go along with Michael's vibe is like a mirror being held up to Michael. It shows him the truth that he is constantly hiding from. In their bitter relationship, Michael is clearly the antagonist and Toby the victim. Michael seems to be completely blind to how harsh his treatment of Toby is and claims that Toby is the bad guy and that he tortures him (he points this out to Holly in \\"Goodbye, Toby\\"), completely ignoring that he verbally puts Toby down on a daily basis while the latter simply does his job and voices his own opinion and attempts to dissuade Michael from ideas that are truly reckless and impulsive and unethical in the office. Even on occasions where Toby offers kindness to Michael such as in \\"The Deposition\\" and \\"Niagara,\\" Michael shows nothing but rudeness and hatred. Michael viewed Toby as his sworn enemy and took every opportunity to demean him. As Michael sneers, \\"Toby is in HR, which technically means he works for corporate, so he's really not a part of our family. Also, he's divorced, so he's really not a part of his family\\" and says that \\"Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry.\\" He also stated, \\"I hate so much about the things that you choose to be\\" (immediately following the above quote from Toby regarding the Casino Night). At various times, Michael has referred to Toby as \\"the worst human being ever\\", a \\"convicted rapist,\\" \\"evil snail,\\" \\"animal rapist,\\" \\"Satan\\" and \\"the Antichrist.\\" Michael once says that if he \\"had a gun with two bullets and was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden and Toby, [he] would shoot Toby twice.\\" Michael has physically hurt Toby on a few occasions as well such as throwing a pen at his forehead and checking him while skating. Michael frequently threatened to fire Toby, which he could not do because Toby is not considered a local branch employee, having been hired by the corporate office and then assigned to Scranton. The majority of Michael's techniques that are questionable bring Toby by his own obligation to confront Michael about how corporate would like him to do his job. Ultimately Toby and Michael represent the conflict between employees and upper management. While Toby is mainly a passive victim to Michael's abuse who tries his best to remain calm, Toby himself has shown on a few occasions in the series that he enjoys seeing Michael in misery such as when he injures his foot and collapses and struggles in the restroom (where Michael is disgusted by the idea of Toby helping him instead of Ryan, and Toby gets to mock Michael's wimpiness and notes with disdain \\"you only grilled your foot\\") and when Toby viciously beats Michael in a game of poker, in which he says he will chase the feeling of taking Michael's money. Toby has also laughed at Michael's misfortune on occasion such as in \\"The Deposition\\" when Toby learns that Michael thinks Ryan is hot and also in \\"Koi Pond\\" when he learns Michael has fallen into two fountains. Toby once even instructed Pam on how to hit Michael harder after he gave her the opportunity to do so for dating and dumping her mother, showing that he enjoys seeing Michael suffer to a degree. Toby has on occasion stood up to Michael such as in \\"Classy Christmas\\" when Michael tries to accuse Toby of destroying Holly's beloved Woody doll, to which Toby immediately responds that the vandalism is something that Michael would do, to which everyone agrees. Toby seems to have a strong ability to absorb Michael's abuse as seen in \\"Goodbye, Toby\\" where he is given a potential opportunity to complain about Michael's antics and after Michael threatens to kill him (though he does so in a situation where Holly and Pam would be able to listen to Toby's issues if he wanted to present them, as they either do not know how awful Michael has been to him or, in Pam's case, know it very well), Toby claims that everything in the office is fine, and later shrugs to the camera that he has survived Michael's abuse long enough and that disclosing it is pointless. Toby has never attempted in any way to get Michael punished for his harsh treatment of him (despite having the power to do so) and has never gotten angry with him for unknown reasons. This stands in direct contrast to other members of the Office who get angered at Michael for his stupidity and rudeness such as Jim, Pam, and (notably) Stanley. Toby also somewhat seems to be in denial that Michael hates him as seen in \\"New Guys\\" in which after shooting down his impulsive idea, Andy says to Toby, \\"Now I know why Michael hated you so much,\\" to which Toby responds \\"No, he didn't,\\" possibly signifying that Toby does not view Michael's abuse as hatred. Michael himself has even shown shock at Toby's passive attitude to his abusive actions, notably seen in \\"Frame Toby\\" when after he and Dwight attempt to frame Toby for being a marijuana user in order to get him fired, Michael actually feels true guilt and attempts to stop it though is absolutely shocked after the situation is resolved when Toby expresses anger for them wasting the cop's time, all the while completely ignoring the fact that he potentially could have been arrested and fired from his job, possibly showing that Michael also hates Toby for allowing himself to be abused and not standing up for himself. Toby seems to want Michael's friendship but is too shy to talk to him about it. In \\"The Lover,\\" Michael opens up to Toby, asking him to keep Pam under control, by giving Toby a hug and calling him a \\"good guy.\\" Toby says that he is delighted and \\"Michael would like me once he got to know me,\\" but as soon as Toby fails to keep Pam under control, Michael starts to hate him again. Michael, though, ended up being appreciative of Toby's efforts to actually help him during their Sabre-mandated counseling sessions (even if he spent much of the time hurling harsh statements at the HR rep), to the point where he decided to talk to Toby instead of simply signing off on a few corrected forms at the sessions' end. While in \\"Take Your Daughter to Work Day,\\" Michael ends up bonding with Toby's daughter Sasha when the employees bring their children into the office. However, later on, Michael becomes withdrawn and sad that he has not had any children, which Toby senses and ends up being a confidante to Michael. Michael inquires about being Sasha's godfather. Toby simply tells him that she already has one. Michael has on a few occasions realized when his mistreatment of Toby has gone too far such as in \\"Women's Appreciation\\" in which he literally asked him to expose his genitals and also in the aforementioned \\"Frame Toby\\" after attempting to get Toby arrested and fired, possibly showing that Michael's hatred of Toby has limits. In \\"Goodbye, Michael,\\" when Michael wants to give everyone in the office a proper goodbye, he somewhat makes up for all the times he has berated and insulted Toby by listening to him without insulting him once, possibly showing that he will miss Toby somewhat. However, his face betrays both his difficulty in doing so and his horror when an appreciative Toby suggests that Michael look up Toby's brother Rory in Boulder once he has settled himself in Colorado. This can be viewed as Michael's final comeuppance for his treatment of Toby as even though he is moving away to Colorado, he will still not escape Toby and will have to endure annoyance from Toby's brother Rory (who seems to be virtually identical to him and whom Toby encourages to be friends with Michael). =Pam= Pam and Toby are shown to have a good relationship. Pam has shown much displeasure at Michael's harsh treatment of Toby. Toby has had a crush on Pam ever since she called off her wedding with Roy and Jim went to Stamford, but he is too shy to tell her his feelings. In \\"Cocktails\\" Toby spends his whole evening trying to win a stuffed animal duck at a claw machine for her. When he finally wins, Pam gives back the stuffed animal and asks, \\"Don't you have a daughter?\\" In \\"Dunder Mifflin Infinity\\" Toby is the first to find out about Jim and Pam's relationship when he sees her kiss him on the cheek in the break room. Upset about Pam's new relationship, he sends out a memo asking for no public displays of affection in the office. In the episode \\"Business School\\", Pam asks Toby to come to her art show, and he says he cannot make it because of his daughter's play. He then gets really upset and yells, \\"Damn it!\\" and questions if maybe he does not have to go to see his daughter's play and instead could go see Pam's art show. In \\"Night Out\\", Pam thinks that a joke Toby told was funny, and he gets really excited and puts his hand on her leg. After an awkward silence, Toby announces his move to Costa Rica. While shocked that he touched her, Pam does not appear to be angered at Toby for this in subsequent episodes. In \\"Goodbye, Toby\\" Pam gives to Toby an office picture of the staff that excludes her (because she took the picture herself) for when he leaves for Costa Rica. Toby, unsatisfied by the lack of her presence, shouts at the office staff asking for a camera (possibly the loudest he has ever spoken). When no one responds, he runs off for an extended amount of time just to find a camera to have a picture of her and him together. Pam also helps Toby take revenge against Michael in this episode after his insulting farewell gift is exposed during a meeting and she gets him to unwillingly give up his watch to Toby. At the end of the episode, Pam comments (though not to Toby) that she always thought he was kind of cute and that she will miss him a lot. In \\"Niagara\\" Toby appears to still have feelings for Pam and is happy when they run out on their wedding. He is later disappointed when the wedding is called back on but is seen smiling and clapping after they're married and run down the aisle. In \\"Double Date\\", Toby instructs Pam on how to punch Michael even harder for revenge for him dating and dumping her mother, which Pam appears to appreciate. During \\"Roy's Wedding\\", while Jim and Pam are trying to find out if there is anything they do not know about each other, Toby correctly answers facts about Pam. Everyone notices him, and Toby, clearly embarrassed, attempts to cover it up. There have been a few occasions when Pam has mistreated Toby somewhat such as hanging up on him on the phone after Toby gave her helpful advice and telling him to get out of the room before Michael (stressed over a breakup) arrives and notably in \\"Paper Airplane\\" after hitting him in the eye with a paper airplane and getting angry at him for crossing (to which Toby apologizes). Pam in response does not apologize and simply asks whether she is still in the contest despite injuring and temporarily blinding Toby. In the series finale, while dancing with Pam, Toby began sobbing. Pam questions Toby with \\"Is it me? Is it Nellie?\\" Toby shakes his head, and responds with \\"It's everything.\\" Pam then hugs Toby as he weeps. =Jim= Jim mentions that when he first started working at Dunder Mifflin, he shared a cubicle with Toby and that the two of them got along well. Michael moved them apart because he thought that the two talked too much. In deleted scenes from The Fire and Take Your Daughter to Work Day it's implied that Toby and Jim are friends and Jim babysits Toby's daughter on occasion. When Jim becomes Co-Regional Manager with Michael in season six, however, Jim almost begins to mirror Michael's treatment of Toby somewhat. In \\"The Lover\\", when Toby casually says \\"Hey Jim,\\" a stressed Jim snaps \\"Not now Toby! My God!\\" leaving Toby bewildered and hurt (Jim however had just been angered upon learning that Michael is dating Pam's mother behind their backs). In the earlier \\"Survivor Man\\", after Toby demands that he get a birthday party that Michael previously took away from him and a cake, a frustrated Jim says about Toby \\"He's great, but sometimes he can be a little bit much\\", showing that he sees Toby as being annoying sometimes, which is further proven in the episode \\"Dwight Christmas\\" in which he and Darryl immediately leave the kitchen when Toby starts talking about his work on the Scranton Strangler case (implying Toby never stops talking about it). Jim was aware of Toby's crush on Pam but never seemed very bothered by it, aside from the episode \\"Night Out\\" in which he is shown to be shocked when Toby awkwardly touches Pam's leg. However, Jim has shown disgust at Michael's treatment of Toby on occasion. However, Toby would occasionally be bitter towards Jim, as seen in \\"Did I Stutter?\\" where he assists Ryan (now vice president of Dunder Mifflin) in giving Jim a formal warning for his job performance and criticizes him very bitterly in \\"Branch Wars\\" when Pam reluctantly allows Jim to join the Finer Things Club, though this likely all stems from Toby's jealousy of Jim's relationship with Pam. During \\"Stairmageddon\\", Jim turns to Toby for advice on marriage counseling due to Toby's past of going to such counseling. Jim is left thoughtful and concerned when Toby notes that Pam is in a very difficult situation of short-term vs. long-term issues with Jim's work at Athlead. Despite the moments mentioned above, Jim and Toby have a decent relationship. =Kelly and Ryan= Toby shares the Annex with Kelly, and he is exasperated at being in the close proximity of Kelly and Ryan's juvenile romantic escapades. Using the excuse that he was allergic to his desk, Toby moved locations to escape Kelly's constant talking, moving out of the cubicle, albeit only to a desk adjacent to it. Toby later wonders if Michael intentionally moved Ryan to his former area in order to torture him via Ryan and Kelly's endless fighting, commenting that \\"If he did... genius.\\" Kelly stated in a deleted scene from Goodbye, Toby that she was attracted to Toby but could not stand \\"his stupid kid\\" and was visibly downcast when he announced his plans to leave the office and move to Costa Rica. =Darryl= In a deleted scene from \\"Ben Franklin\\", when warehouse foreman Darryl Philbin is told that Michael has sent Toby home to prevent him from interfering with the hiring of a stripper, Darryl refers to Toby (\\"that red-haired guy with the sad eyes\\") as a cool guy. While on a trip to the Corporate offices with Darryl and Michael in \\"The Negotiation\\", Darryl also offers to let Toby crash for the night at a relative's house in New York, denying Michael the same opportunity. He also had a nickname for Toby (\\"T-dog\\") at one point, though their relationship soured when Dwight's plan to expose Darryl's worker's compensation fraud led to embarrassment for all of them and Toby insulted Darryl and his sister. Despite this, the two seem to have a good relationship and Darryl once gave Toby his Christmas doll to give to his daughter Sasha, after Toby paid him $400, which was double the price that Dwight sold them at. =Andy= Toby and Andy did not appear to have any major disputes when Andy was a salesman (aside from the episode \\"Casual Friday\\") or during his first year as manager and seemed to have a good relationship. In \\"New Guys\\", when Toby shoots down Andy's unethical idea to make up a cause to fire Nellie Bertram, Andy responds \\"now I know why Michael hated you so much\\", Toby appeared dismayed at this. Andy later ridiculed both Toby and Nellie during the slacklining later in the episode. Andy continued his irritability in \\"Work Bus\\" when asking Toby \\"how are you not murdered every hour\\", suggesting he, like Michael and Jim before him, has inherited the typical manager's disdain for Toby. Andy was occasionally nasty to Toby on a few other occasions as well and even groped Toby before quitting Dunder Mifflin. Toby appeared aware of Andy's poor treatment of Erin as a girlfriend, which he pointed out to Nellie in \\"Customer Loyalty\\". In the finale, however, after Andy returns with a more positive and friendly attitude, Toby is pleased to hear him (and several other staff members) encourage him to join them at the after party in the warehouse, implying the two are now on good terms. =Dwight= Toby and Dwight appear to have a stable relationship and Dwight does not appear to hate Toby like Michael does, though on a few occasions Dwight has helped Michael make Toby miserable such as trying to get him arrested and fired once he returned from his vacation from Costa Rica (even more enthusiastically and intently than Michael) and stealing a Christmas present from him on Michael's orders and attempting to sabotage him in \\"Fun Run\\". Dwight also made no attempt to help Toby when he was selling Christmas dolls and ran out just as Toby asked for one for his daughter. Dwight has also on a few occasions laughed at Michael's insults towards Toby but has also shown some displeasure when Michael takes it too far such as in \\"Goodbye Toby\\", where he himself admits that he thought Michael's idea to give Toby a rock as a goodbye present was over the line. It is likely that Dwight makes Toby miserable due to his loyalty to Michael, however even after Michael left Dwight would occasionally still mistreat Toby and insult him, once even calling him \\"the most forgettable man in the known world\\" and having Robert California's son pretend to fire him. The two have gotten along on a few occasions and it is revealed that Dwight complains to Toby all the time about Jim's pranks against him and once made a deal with him to sign a petition of his in exchange for cookies from Toby's daughter. Toby and Dwight also share an interest in trains during a conversation while spying on Darryl and Dwight says he is welcome anytime to come to his farm. Toby has on occasion been stern with Dwight, notably in \\"Casual Friday\\", in which he threatened to write him up if he did not sit down and has foiled some of Dwight's dangerous schemes such as leaving weapons in the office and stopping Dwight from wearing dangerous costumes to Halloween (for which Dwight threatens to kill him). In the final episode of the series, Dwight fires Toby alongside Kevin (though less harshly), possibly indicating that he dislikes Toby and that he annoys him to a degree, like his predecessors Michael, Jim, and Andy (or possibly on orders from Corporate or to prevent him from interfering in his firing of Kevin). While Dwight states that he misses Kevin after firing him, he never states the same for Toby. Dwight does, however, invite him to his wedding, possibly showing that he does consider him a friend. =Nellie= In \\"Get the Girl\\"Get the Girl Toby introduces himself to Nellie as Tony, to which Pam replies \\"You messed up saying your name?\\" He answers her by saying, \\"It happens, okay?\\" In \\"Dwight Christmas\\", at the office Christmas party, Nellie expressed interest upon hearing that Toby had been a juror in the Scranton Strangler case. He proceeds to bore her, however, with a long, drawn-out account that is implied to have lasted for several hours. Nellie finally leans in close and shushes him. A puzzled Toby then asks if she is about to kiss him. Attempting to save face, Nellie gives him a small kiss, which causes an emboldened Toby to give her a much more passionate kiss. Toby does not appear in the two subsequent episodes, during which the events of the party are not referenced. In \\"Customer Loyalty\\", however, he appears very tactile and affectionate towards Nellie, apparently under the impression that the two are now in a relationship. Nellie, for her part, had forgotten the kiss until that point and finds Toby's affection somewhat awkward. In \\"Moving On\\", Nellie gets fed up with Toby's constant hand-wringing over the possible non-guilt of the convicted Scranton Strangler and pushes him to visit the man in prison; when the Strangler proves he is the killer and nearly kills Toby himself, Nellie admits Toby was brave and a speechless Toby (his larynx was injured by the Strangler) looks happy. However, Nellie later firmly establishes her contempt for Toby and there is no further romantic story-line between them. She is also somewhat rude and insulting to him on a few occasions notably in \\"Paper Airplane\\" in which she speaks of him as being a loser, however, Nellie's poor treatment of him could stem from Toby's awkward and annoying behaviour towards her. When Toby returns to Scranton for the reunion and Angela and Dwight's wedding, Nellie (also returning to Scranton from her new home in Poland) lets the camera crew know she is not thrilled about seeing Toby again. At the airport, Nellie rebuffs an attempted hug from Toby, snidely brushes aside his comment about a relationship she ended by saying she un-followed him on Facebook and questions him of how long he has been stalking her (Toby quietly says anyone can read non-protected tweets) and declines his offer to share a cab into town. After that point, Toby has no further interactions of any kind with Nellie. =Pete and Clark= After the departure of Kelly and Ryan, Toby appears more excited with the arrival of the two twenty-somethings who are single like himself. He appears to see them as closer friends than they see him but neither of them treats him meanly either. He convinced both of them, along with Kevin and Darryl, to grow moustaches from \\"Movember\\", believing this was a bonding activity. He was disappointed when Pete shaved his moustache off after Erin found it off-putting. Toby appears to consider Pete a better fit for Erin than Andy, largely because he does not appreciate Andy's belittling treatment of him and also because he never had any romantic interest in Erin. At the documentary reunion, Pete is nice to Toby and is visibly happy when Toby decides to attend an after-party he had been planning to skip. Seasons 1‚Äì2 Toby only appears in a few episodes, showing up first in a scene in \\"Diversity Day\\", in which he jokes about sitting in an Indian Circle (to which everyone else laughs). Michael, having told many more offensive jokes, is offended by Toby's joke and tells him that \\"This is an environment of welcoming, and you should just get the hell out of here.\\" Toby does so and the staff suddenly goes very quiet. This is the first instance in the relationship between the two, Toby trying to be responsible, and Michael trying to demean and undermine him as much as possible. In \\"Hot Girl\\", Toby is introduced by Michael to Katy the purse saleswoman; after Toby and Katy begin talking happily about their high school days, Michael deliberately humiliates Toby by mentioning his divorce and how he once briefly had to live in his car. He also notices the picture of Toby's daughter on his desk, and refers to her as \\"cute\\"; however, this is probably a further attempt to portray Toby, a divorced father, as undesirable.Season 1 One of Toby's major appearances was in \\"Sexual Harassment\\", where he holds a Sexual Harassment Meeting for the staff, only to be interrupted by Michael and a blow-up doll. Michael then states that everyone is still \\"generally quite happy\\", which he thinks is because Toby has not yet had the meeting. In fact, Toby did have the meeting and everyone clapped after he was done, leaving them in a good mood. In a deleted scene of \\"Halloween\\", Toby tries to persuade Michael to make a decision as to which employee he must fire. When Michael chooses Toby, Toby replies that he does not report to Michael. When Michael then tries to get Toby to quit, Toby replies that someone else will just take his place. Michael then claims that if he had the authority, he would immediately fire Toby, to which Toby calmly replies, \\"I know, Michael.\\" In \\"Booze Cruise\\", Toby is late arriving at the dock for a company cruise. When Michael orders the ship to leave without him, Toby grins broadly, implying he had planned things in order to miss the event. In \\"Take Your Daughter to Work Day\\", Toby's daughter, Sasha, distracts Michael; the two actually get along, showing Michael's friendly side. Toby and Michael have a good conversation about Michael's desire to have a family: Michael wants to have a biological child, and Toby hints that he should seek out alternatives. When Michael asks if Sasha already has a godfather, Toby quickly replies, \\"Yes.\\" \\"Conflict Resolution\\" is Toby's biggest role in the season. Toby shows that he handles inter-office complaints calmly and efficiently, only to see his work undone by Michael's stupidity. When Dwight threatens to quit unless Michael fires Jim (because of Jim's history of pranks against Dwight), Michael attempts to resolve the conflict by making vague promises of future action, an approach similar to one Toby had used successfully in the past. Toby covertly shows that he files Dwight's complaints against Jim in a trash box and that he puts the huge number of complaints against Michael in unmarked boxes that are filed into the vast space of the warehouse. In \\"Casino Night\\", Toby tries to convince Michael not to invite Boy Scouts to a company Casino Night. Michael's response is to demean him in front of everybody. Toby just lets him finish. That night, however, Toby viciously beats Michael at no-limit Texas Hold 'Em, to Michael's visible irritation. Later, Toby says to the camera, \\"I'm not gonna lie‚Äîit felt good to take money from Michael. I'm gonna chase that feeling.\\"Season 2 Seasons 3‚Äì4 In \\"The Convention\\", after finding out that Pam is no longer engaged, Toby makes a couple of attempts to ask her out but can't say the words. Michael trashes Toby to Jim and eagerly asks Jim if the HR rep is the reason he left for Stamford. Michael is visibly stung when Jim says no (he later tells Michael about his declaration of love for Pam). In \\"The Convict\\", Michael jokingly refers to Toby as a rapist, much to the dismay of those present. Later, Toby convinces Michael to release the office employees from the conference room, whom he had locked in there as punishment for unfavorably comparing Dunder Mifflin to a prison. In \\"A Benihana Christmas\\", Michael has Dwight take Toby's gift bag present of an expensive robe when they run out of enough of them for everyone. Pam later comes over and kindly gives her robe to Toby. In \\"Back from Vacation\\", Toby asks Michael about the \\"Jamaica Jan Sun Princess\\" photo. Michael tries to accuse Toby of stealing the file from him, but Toby says \\"nine different people sent it to me, including my ex-wife, and, well, we don't talk.\\" Michael then insults Toby's divorce again and calls him a perv, but does state for the record that he and Jan do not have a relationship. In \\"Phyllis' Wedding\\", Toby is seen with a beautiful woman whom he says he met in the gym, although Kevin believes she is a paid escort. When Phyllis tosses her bouquet, it is Toby's date that catches it, and then excitedly runs back to Toby and the two share a brief embrace and kiss. Toby is then shown in a talking head as very ecstatic towards the outcome. It is implied that Toby and his date eventually broke up afterwards as this is the only episode where she is seen. In \\"Business School\\", he tells Pam he cannot make it to her art show because his daughter has a play. He then offers to miss his daughter's play because \\"what they do is not art.\\" In \\"Cocktails\\", Toby spends the whole evening trying to win Pam a duck from a claw machine after she comments on how cute it is. When he finally wins it, Pam suggests that he give it to his daughter instead. In \\"The Negotiation\\", Toby is forced to listen to Ryan and Kelly bickering nonstop when Michael moves Ryan back to the annex. Toby wonders if Michael did this to punish Toby and that if he did, it was a genius move. Toby goes with Michael and Darryl to New York after Jan says she will not do the contract negotiation unless Toby is there. When Michael repeatedly mentions his and Jan's relationship at that point, Toby takes notes and Michael insults him, but Toby just says he has \\"preparing for the deposition\\" that he thinks will inevitably occur because Michael threatened to withhold sex from a female superior in order to get a modest, scheduled raise, commenting, \\"It will be a groundbreaking case when it inevitably goes to trial.\\" Additionally, when Darryl says he will stay in New York for the night, he tells Toby he can join him and stay at his relative's house, pointedly not extending the same offer to Michael. In \\"Women's Appreciation\\", Toby is out of the office at a parent- teacher conference when Phyllis is flashed. When he returns, Michael scoffs at his alibi and seriously asks to see his penis to rule him out as a suspect. Toby turns towards Michael and looks like he has about to get angry; Michael then seems to catch himself and admits what he said to Toby was wrong. In \\"Beach Games\\", Michael bans Toby from attending the beach event because he wants it to be fun and says it will not be if Toby is there. Toby is visibly upset that he will not get to see Pam in a bikini (which she ends up not wearing there) and is seen despondently doing paper work in a deleted scene from the episode.Season 3 On the Season 3 DVD, Toby gives a series of wraparound interviews. Among other things: *He lists the various insulting nicknames Michael has for him, including \\"The Devil's Butthole\\" and \\"Gargamel\\", noting \\"I prefer Toby\\". *He describes Michael's \\"invention\\" of a safe George Foreman Grill after he burned his foot, which involved putting the Grill inside a bunny cage. *He says that his job is not a nightmare because you wake up from nightmares; it's more like an unrelenting \\"daymare\\". *He lists what he would do if he had one day to live, including wanting to \\"Burn this place (The Office) to the ground\\" this makes the interviewer react with horror and/or disbelief which Toby responds to with a confused \\"What?\\". *He says, \\"HR isn't just a job, it's a way of life. (Pause) But I wish it was just a job.\\"Season 3 DVD In \\"Fun Run\\", Toby goes against Michael's theory of an office curse by mentioning he won a drawing at a local pizza place, but Michael insults him and later ignores his statement that you cannot ask employees about their religions. Before the race, Dwight puts Imodium in Toby's drink instead of Ex-Lax and Michael pulls Toby's shorts down right before the starting gun is fired. Toby later wins the race to cure rabies, beating Michael and accomplishing something noteworthy; however, no one notices his win, and Kelly does not even bother looking up when he crosses the finish line. Toby then wonders why the 5K course was a straight line instead of a circle that would have returned everyone to the Dunder Mifflin building. In \\"Dunder Mifflin Infinity\\", after seeing Pam kiss Jim, Toby sends out a memo about public displays of affection. When Michael accosts Toby about the memo (thinking it's about him and Jan having sex in the office), Toby tells him, in front of everyone, that it is about Jim and Pam. When they confirm that they are dating everyone is happy, except Toby. Later Pam and Jim visit him to see if they have to sign a \\"Love Contract\\", but he tells them to wait and see. In a scene that was added to the episode's repeat airing on NBC, Toby comes into work with a woman he says is his girlfriend and makes out with her right in front of the reception desk and Pam. In \\"Money\\", Toby shows that he uses very good grammar when he corrects Michael and clears up a confusion between the usages of the words \\"whoever\\" and \\"whomever\\" (\\"who\\" is used as a subject, while \\"whom\\" is used as an object). Michael responds by telling Toby to shove a letter opener in his skull. In a deleted scene of \\"Local Ad\\", Toby pitches an idea of having a stop motion ad that Michael, of course, puts down although the rest of the office seems to like the idea. When the local ad is being played at the bar, Toby is in the ad, but only briefly. While Michael was shooting the scene of the paper airplane flying out of the hand of Creed towards the conference room window, you see Toby in the conference room packing up whatever work he was finishing. Michael did not want Toby in the video; however, for a fleeting moment, Toby had managed to unintentionally get a part in the ad. Toby's distaste for Pam's relationship with Jim is again brought up in \\"Branch Wars\\" when Jim is allowed to join \\"The Finer Things Club\\", an exclusive organization built up by Pam, Toby, and Oscar, dedicated to discussing civilized culture. During the episode's final scene, after Jim contributes his ideas on the book being discussed, Toby scrutinizes him very bitterly, hinting again at his disdain for Jim's success with Pam. His irritation is attributed to the fact that Jim did not read the book, though Oscar and even Pam are also annoyed with Jim's wisecracking, uninformed behavior. Also in this episode Michael tells Karen she can have Toby instead of Stanley; when Karen says Toby is not a salesperson, Michael briefly tries to talk up Toby's ability to learn before saying he cannot fake it and insulting the HR rep anew. In the episode \\"Survivor Man\\", Toby ends up getting on Jim's nerves. When Jim is named Acting Manager while Michael is off on his \\"wilderness adventure\\" and starts altering the office's birthday schedule, Toby asks Jim if he can have a birthday celebration, explaining that Michael deliberately held a party for Toby at 4:58 PM on a Friday so no one would attend. Jim agrees but comments that he likes Toby but that the guy is really annoying him, claiming that sometimes Toby can sometimes be a little bit much. Jim's dismissive, disgusted attitude toward Toby (whom he has always gotten along with before) very closely mirrors how Michael treats Toby. It is not clear whether Jim is genuinely fed up with Toby or whether this interplay showed that Jim was beginning to act like Michael. It is also possible that Jim was not annoyed at Toby specifically but at the general reaction to his plan. Jim's disgusted attitude can also be attributed to the fact that Toby has been treating Jim fairly poorly in previous episodes due to his jealousy of his relationship with Pam. Michael's hatred for Toby is brought up again in \\"The Deposition\\" when Michael says he does not want Toby in the deposition and nastily asks if the HR rep is there \\"to renew your divorce vows\\" (Toby is also sitting a conspicuous distance from Michael in the uncrowded room being used for the proceedings). When the two happen to sit next to each other at lunch, Toby kindly tells Michael that he can relate to Michael's situation, of Toby's parents' divorce. While Toby is talking, Michael pushes Toby's lunch tray on the floor, then gets up and leaves. Later in the episode, Toby begins to laugh at Michael after learning Michael thinks Ryan is \\"hot.\\" Also, after Jan's attorney brings out Michael's diary, and the head of the deposition says \\"Okay, we'll need ten copies of that diary\\", to which Toby says, \\"Make that eleven.\\" In a deleted scene, Michael asks Toby if he will tell Meredith that the car accident from Fun Run was Michael's fault, and Toby nods. In the episode \\"Night Out\\", he puts his hand on Pam's leg and caresses it for a long, awkward moment, which everyone standing around seems to notice, making this the first time the employees see Toby's possible crush on Pam. Immediately thereafter, realizing what he had just done, he abruptly announces that he is moving to Costa Rica, runs outside to the security fence, scales it, and disappears into the night. This scene was done by a stunt double, as Lieberstein wanted to do it himself but it was decided for insurance reasons to let the stuntman do his work. In \\"Did I Stutter?\\", Toby and Ryan together (who both have a problem with Jim; Toby dislikes him for dating Pam and Ryan dislikes him for going over his head) warn Jim on his job performance, citing specifically his indifference toward his job and use of time (namely \\"goofing off with Dwight\\" and \\"time spent at Reception\\" with Pam). Toby then says to the camera that Jim's time spent with Pam \\"has finally caught up to him\\", but he repeats Pam's name several times when unnecessary. Toby later says, though, that he agrees that Jim has good numbers but Ryan thinks they are not good enough. In the same episode, Toby convinces Michael he needs to deal with Stanley for his open insubordination during a staff meeting, though Michael goes about it a different way because Toby's method \\"did not work because it was stupid.\\" Michael also says Toby does not have any friends, but Michael does so in the context of stating that Stanley is Michael's friend, which is later shown to be completely inaccurate as Stanley despises him for his stupidity and is not afraid to confront Michael about it. It is also shown that Dwight thinks Toby may be Jewish, as Dwight's org chart shows a blue Star of David with a question mark next to Toby's name; Toby did not say what (if any) religion he practiced when Michael prodded the staffers to talk about their religious practices in Fun Run. As Toby spent time in a seminary (as revealed in season five episode \\"Casual Friday\\") he is most likely a Roman Catholic. In \\"Goodbye, Toby\\", he follows through on his earlier plans and quits his job as HR representative to move to Costa Rica. Michael is overjoyed at his departure and plans to throw a lavish goodbye party that reflects this. Both Kelly and Pam say they are sorry he is leaving, with Pam saying in an interview that she thinks he is kind of cute. Toby also ends up annoying Holly, his replacement, to a degree while showing her around the office and she is somewhat rude to him and claims that he almost bored her to sleep, something which Michael enjoys hearing (Holly remains oblivious that Michael, in fact, abuses Toby and Michael claims that Toby tortures him, though it is possible she only puts Toby down so as to get on Michael's good side). Toby faces a cruel exit interview from Michael but the tables are turned when Holly and Pam join the interview. Michael is unable to berate Toby at length as Holly takes over. When Toby is asked; \\"What would you improve about Dunder Mifflin?\\", Toby claims he has a few ideas. Realizing that Toby has a potential opportunity to reveal and complain about his unethical work behavior and abusive treatment, Michael hides his face and angrily glares at Toby and silently threatens to kill him if he answers the question. Toby does not seem afraid but simply gives a \\"things are OK as they are\\" answer. Toby later tells the camera that he has made it far enough without disclosing Michael's behavior and that there is no point in doing so. Toby gets revenge when Michael's insulting farewell gift to him is exposed (a rock with a note reading: \\"Suck on this!\\") and Pam gets Michael to unwillingly give up his watch to Toby, which he does, clearly upset. Toby's main concern on his last day is getting pictures of himself alone with Pam, which he finally does as his party is ending. Michael gets a last dig in by having Hank the security guard escort Toby out of the office as he leaves for his new life in Costa Rica and is still shown to be upset when Toby looks at his new watch. In a deleted scene at his farewell party, Toby refers to an undefined incident involving his sister; this marks the first time Toby has mentioned having any siblings, although late in season 7 he reveals also having a brother Rory.Season 4 Seasons 5‚Äì6 In season five, Toby is revealed to be in traction in a Costa Rican hospital, with a broken neck, after a zip-line accident on his third day in Costa Rica. He explains that he has yet to see the beach, but expresses some happiness with the camera crew for visiting. He also implies in an earlier talk with Oscar that he is attracted to a woman who is visiting a nearby resort with her husband, thus continuing his tendency to fall for unavailable women √† la Pam. In a deleted scene from Baby Shower, Toby can be heard on the speakerphone with Holly, noting that he enjoys his stay at the hospital more than his treatment from Michael at the office. In \\"Frame Toby\\", it is revealed that Toby had returned to the office for a week without Michael noticing. When the staff tells Michael that Toby is back, Michael thinks it's a joke until he sees Toby and screams \\"No God! Please No! No!\\" Michael asks David Wallace to get rid of Toby but the CFO says he can not fire Toby without cause. Michael then attempts to get Toby fired by giving Pam a fake letter to give to Toby, asking him to hug and kiss her no matter how much she resisted, and taunting the HR rep into punching him, but both plans fail. Michael then tries out Dwight's idea of planting drugs in Toby's desk (unknowingly buying basil from a caprese salad from warehouse workers who he thinks sold him marijuana). However, he does feel guilty about what he has done and, when the police are investigating the \\"drugs\\", Michael tells the police that it's a mistake and tries to stop them from arresting Toby. This suggests that, while Michael does hate Toby, there are limits to his hatred. Then again, Toby's reaction to the setup‚Äîthat it wasted the cops' time that could have been used to deal with law enforcement‚Äîinspires more shock and disgust from Michael. He is seen on occasion in the background in the \\"Annex\\" of the office. When Michael gives his two weeks notice, Toby shows he is not as resentful towards Michael as Michael is to him in a talking head, referring to him as a movie on an airplane, which is nothing special but something to watch. He was seen breaking up a jam session in the lunch room up between Dwight and Andy who were attempting to impress the new receptionist with guitar and banjo to the song \\"Take Me Home, Country Roads\\" by John Denver. Toby simply says, \\"You have to stop.\\" In \\"Stress Relief\\", Toby is seen attempting to help the others escape Dwight's fire drill. In the second part of the episode, during the roasting of Michael, Toby begins to walk to the mike but Michael stops him declaring that only friends are allowed to roast him and Toby agrees and sits back down and laughs with the rest of the audience at Michael being roasted. It is possible Michael stopped Toby from roasting him not only because they are not friends but because Toby would have the worst things to say about him. He is also involved in the episode \\"Casual Friday\\" where he has a talking head about his beginnings at Dunder Mifflin. He used to be in seminary, but he left because he wanted to have sex with a girl named Kathy and took the HR job at Dunder Mifflin so he could be with her. Kathy is revealed to be the name of his ex-wife, and he does not appear to have a passion for HR. In the same episode, he has to deal with complaints about a too relaxed dress code by Oscar and Meredith. For the first time, he is stern with his employees and enforces HR policy by cancelling Casual Fridays at the office.Season 5 In the episode \\"Gossip\\", Michael spreads rumors about various people throughout the Office, including that Toby is a virgin, even though he has a daughter. In the episode \\"The Meeting\\", Dwight and Toby investigate a dishonest workman's compensation claim filed by Darryl, an event which results in Dwight and Darryl filing complaints against each other, leaving Toby to \\"drown in a sea of paperwork.\\" During the episode, Toby ends up bonding with Dwight when they share an interest in trains, and finds that Dwight is restoring a life size one in his slaughterhouse. Although he does not appear, directly, in the episode The Promotion, Michael and Jim put baked beans on pictures of the employees as a way to decide the raises. Jim then sees a drawn picture of what looks to be a clown with a caption saying \\"I'm an idiot\\" and asks Michael who it is, Michael answers, saying it is Toby. Jim reminds Michael that Toby is not part of this and Michael answers \\"I just wanted to draw a picture of him\\". In the episode \\"Niagara\\", Toby kindly offers Michael the second bed he has in his room but Michael insults him by telling him he will be sleeping alone for the rest of his life and walks away. Toby seems to at least have some feelings left for Pam, as he seems to be happy when reacting to a possibility of Jim and Pam's wedding being called off. When the wedding does go on, however, he is seen dancing with the others and cheering Jim and Pam on as they walk down the aisle at the ceremony's end. In the following episode, \\"Mafia\\", Oscar comments that with Jim and Pam off on their honeymoon and Toby having \\"mentally checked out in June\\" he is the only person left to counter insane antics with rational thinking. When hearing of Oscar's comments Toby casually agrees with him.Season 6 In the episode \\"The Lover\\", Toby is yelled at by both Michael and Jim when he walks in on them just after Michael has told Jim he is dating Pam's mom. Later, after Pam blew up at Michael in the conference during an office meeting, Michael comes to Toby desperate to make Pam happy about his relationship with her mother. Toby offers to talk to Pam for Michael and Michael even goes as far as hugging Toby and calls him a good good-guy. Toby is extremely happy at the hope that things will finally change between them that he says \\"you know I always knew that if Michael just took the time to get to know me, we would be friends.\\" But once Toby is unable to smooth things over, Michael dismisses Toby as a jackass and goes right back to hating him. In the episode \\"Koi Pond\\", Toby is present in the meeting where Michael wants to talk about insults in the office and as usual when Toby simply makes a point Michael insults him by calling him a waste of life, though corrects himself claiming that's what he would like to say but the meeting is an insult free zone. However, when Michael reveals he has fallen into two fountains Toby appears to find this funny and laughs at Michael. After this, he asks for Michael to kick him out of the meeting and Michael tells him to go. In the episode \\"Double Date\\", Toby talks to Pam to make sure she plans on hitting Michael off grounds. He then gives Pam some tips on how to punch harder, even going through motions with her on how to do it as Michael watches on from his office, visibly afraid. In the episode \\"Secret Santa\\", Toby is called \\"Antichrist\\" for calling Michael's Jesus costume inappropriate. In \\"The Banker\\" Toby is interviewed by an investment banker as he evaluates the branch. Michael tries to have Toby distracted while Dwight impersonates him but Toby appears and makes Dwight leave. Despite knowing of several questionable incidents that have taken place in the office, he does not say anything to the banker. He expresses his torn feelings about this in a talking head. In \\"Whistleblower\\", Toby is revealed to have written a few chapters of a mystery novel and receives advice on the plot from Jo Bennett to which he replies in an interview, \\"Write your own damn novel!\\" Seasons 7‚Äì8 In \\"Nepotism\\", as a punishment for physically injuring an employee, Michael is sent to a 6-hour counselling with Toby. In a deleted scene, Toby tells the camera crew that he finished writing his book over the summer and got four sales out of his self-publishing but is being sued for plagiarism. In \\"Counseling\\", Toby does counselling for Michael. They briefly become friends as Michael talks to Toby about his life, but when Michael realizes that Toby is, in fact, counselling him, Michael yells at him. Toby reveals that he has a degree in social work. At the end of the episode, however, he seems to be communicating with Toby civilly, as most of his anger is fixed on Gabe Lewis. In \\"Costume Contest\\", Toby dresses up as a hobo. In a deleted scene, while using a Ouija board at the office Hallowe'en party, he mumbles that \\"being dead is going to be so relaxing\\", disturbing his co- workers. In \\"Christening\\", Toby has trouble entering the church where Jim and Pam's baby is being christened. After many false starts, he finally enters the chapel and can be seen in front of the altar asking \\"Why do you have to be so mean to me?\\" In a deleted scene from \\"WUPHF.com\\", he is talking with his daughter via web chat, where he finds out through her that his ex-wife has a new boyfriend. Michael shuts off Toby's laptop and then proceeds to talk with him about the situation he is in with Ryan. Toby tries to offer the best advice he can, but as usual, Michael brushes off what he says and then pokes fun at the fact that someone else is banging his wife. In \\"Classy Christmas\\" Toby has to go on leave so he can report for jury duty. The case turns out to be that of the Scranton Strangler, a fact Toby lets slip out despite his not supposed to be talking about the case. He later says to the camera crew he likes the attention. Michael is visibly disgusted when Toby returns on jury recess to attend the Christmas party and tells the staff to not ask Toby any questions as he will not leave and this will prevent Holly from returning. In the second part of the episode, Michael attempts to frame Toby for vandalizing Holly's beloved Woody Doll but Toby immediately denies it and flips it around on Michael claiming the vandalism is something he would do, to which everyone agrees to eventually. Toby has a minor role in Michael Scott's film \\"Threat Level Midnight\\" as a hostage. When the villain Goldenface (played by Jim), decides to show the hero (played by Michael Scott) how serious he is, he decides to kill a hostage, naturally picking Toby. When Goldface shoots Toby's character, his head explodes in an overly dramatic fashion. However, Michael tells Goldenface that the joke is on him, saying that Toby was a \\"wanted animal rapist\\". Toby returns in \\"Michael's Last Dundies\\", where he appears to have lost a considerable amount of weight. In the beginning of the episode, Michael eggs his house in the morning and drives away. Toby is later seen at the Dundies sitting with Jim and Pam. Michael awards Toby with the \\"Extreme Repulsiveness\\" award (with Deangelo commenting how mean that is). Toby refuses to accept it but is told he has to by the other employees because Michael is leaving. Toby then reluctantly accepts it, but tells Michael he finds the award hateful. He then goes on to say that he is taking advantage of being up on the platform, and lets everyone know that the jury found The Scranton Strangler guilty and that he is being put to death. However, Toby is now having doubts about the verdict, saying he thinks the Strangler might be innocent, but is interrupted by an \\"Oh Yeah\\" sound effect from Dwight's synthesizer. In \\"Goodbye, Michael\\", Michael is seen saying goodbye to Toby without insulting him, possibly indicating that he will miss Toby on some level. However, Michael is visibly disgusted when he learns that Toby has a brother, Rory (played by Paul Lieberstein's real-life brother Warren), who lives in Boulder, Colorado as well. Later, Toby is seen talking to Rory via Skype and tells him he thinks his brother and Michael would \\"hit it off in an odd way\\". Rory suggests that he could bring Michael a welcome basket, and asks Toby if Michael likes Jams, but Toby informs him that Michael hates them. In the beginning of \\"The Inner Circle\\", Deangelo informs Toby that he is getting a new chair, but Deangelo, trying to be confusing so the staff will not \\"figure him out\\", tells Toby he does not care if he likes it. Toby is still grateful. In \\"Dwight K. Schrute, (Acting) Manager\\", he gets to fill out the gun violence accident form, much to his excitement. After Jo demotes Dwight upon learning of his gun accident, she appoints Toby as one of the search committee members who would be in charge of interviewing candidates for the manager position (along with Jim and Gabe). In \\"The List\\", new CEO Robert California makes a list of the people in the office, dividing them between perceived \\"winners\\" and \\"losers\\"; he takes the winners out to lunch. Although Toby is on the list of \\"winners\\", he concludes that it must be a mistake, and excuses himself in the middle of lunch. In \\"Lotto\\", Toby says in a talking- head interview that if he won the lottery, he would not change his life at all, except for quitting his job, moving away, and maybe re-entering the dating world.http://www.nbc.com/the-office/video/wondering-about-a- windfall/1361025?auto=true He also says he would spend a lot of time launching his true-crime podcast, \\"The Flenderson Files\\". In \\"Garden Party\\", Toby arrives at \\"Schrute Farms\\" and asks Dwight's cousin, Mose, where to park. Mose states that he is the valet and that Toby has to give him his car. Reluctantly, and after much pressure, Toby lets Mose park his car. It proves to be a bad choice, however, as Mose drives his car straight into a cornfield (though it is not damaged, and becomes the first of many cars parked there in odd, Mose-chosen order). In \\"Spooked\\", Dwight and Robert California's son Bert hearken back to the days when Toby was continuously mistreated by Michael when they \\"prank\\" Toby by telling him he is fired. Toby finds Bert's treatment of him hurtful‚Äîespecially Bert saying he can have Toby fired because he is the CEO's kid‚Äîand Dwight finds the whole bit hilarious. In \\"Test the Store\\", Toby has a rare substantial role in a Season 8 episode, where he leads a self- defense lecture for the employees after they believe Andy was attacked by a gang and left with a black eye (Toby and everyone else later find out Andy was punched by a rude 4th-grade girl when he defended Pam from a barrage of tossed pine cones). When Toby is not aggressive enough for Kelly Kapoor's taste, she stands up and begins threatening and swinging at him, after which Andy defends Toby and gets punched in his other eye. Season 9 In \\"New Guys\\", Andy returns from Outward Bound manager training, making him become more \\"decisive and confident\\". When Andy tells Toby that he plans to fabricate an excuse to fire Nellie, Toby shoots down the idea as a violation of corporate policy, prompting Andy to tell Toby \\"I understand why Michael didn't like you.\\" When Andy hosts a motivational exercise involving a tightrope, he insults Toby and Nellie in front of the staff. Since that time, Andy has been rude towards Toby in a manner that echoes Michael Scott's hatred of his harmless HR rep, though Toby seems much less affected by Andy's behavior than he was by Michael's. When Andy went off on his long boat trip, Toby's time in the last season was devoted to his unrequited romantic interest in Nellie Bertram and his belief that he'd convicted an innocent man during his jury time on the Scranton Strangler case (a theory he put to rest when he went to visit the convict in prison and was, in fact, choked and nearly strangled by him). In the series finale, it's revealed that Toby was fired immediately after Dwight fired Kevin Malone (it's likely that the Corporate office fired Toby and Dwight simply had the burden of telling him) and Toby then moved to New York where he is trying to become a novelist and has six roommates. Toby surprises his former co- workers at the reunion panel when he says that his life feels meaningless now that he is not being filmed for the documentary anymore. He breaks down in tears while dancing with Pam at Dwight and Angela's wedding, saying of what's bad in his life that \\"It's everything!\\", but he seems cheered a little when the group insists he join them for post-wedding festivities. In a photo gallery NBC released of \\"where are they now?\\" info-bits for the characters, it's revealed that Toby has returned to his destiny by taking on an HR position at a TJ Maxx store.

The Catholic Democrats have more than 20,000 members in all 50 American states and Puerto Rico. It claims no authorization from the Catholic Church, or any Catholic bishop, Catholic diocese, candidate or candidate committee. The organization was founded in response to the 2004 presidential election, which, in the view of the group, had witnessed unprecedented attempts to bend Catholic Social Teaching to accommodate policies which are in conflict with the teaching and values of the Church. It characterizes its membership as people who share an aversion to the kind of abuses of U.S. military power that led to the Iraq War, along with \\"the exploitation of social issues to advance the economic interests of a few, and the misuse of our Catholic faith for political gain.\\" The group was angered as well by what it perceived as manipulation of Church teaching to the advantage of conservative and Republican interests: \\"conservatives have increasingly used Catholic language and Catholic congregations to advance their economic agenda and political interests.\\" particularly its insistence on ‚Äúa consistent moral framework anchored in the scriptures and expressed in the teachings of the Church.‚Äù The group specifies the bishops' call for a new commitment to advancing public policies that work in the interest of the common good. Catholic Democrats support Pope Francis's stances on the central issues within Catholic social teaching (\\"war, poverty, unintended pregnancy, preventable illness, the death penalty, instability of the family, and supporting the dialogue balancing medical advances and the dignity of the individual\\") which it feels that the Republican Party neglects in favor of others, notably abortion, euthanasia and homosexuality. The group's website features the week's gospel readings, news stories and commentary, papal encyclicals and resources for adoption. Involvement with 2008 presidential election During the 2008 presidential election, the organization launched the Catholics for Barack Obama website, which included a petition of endorsement for Catholics to sign in support of Democratic Party nominee Barack Obama's candidacy, the Catholic questions and answers on abortion, and a welcome by Catholic actor Martin Sheen. Additionally, the Web site included links to the book, written by Catholic Democrats President Patrick Whelan with a preface by Victoria Reggie Kennedy, entitled The Catholic Case for Obama. The group helped articulate a new approach to the abortion problem, also championed by the Obama Campaign, that focused on reduction strategies and emphasized finding common ground solutions. President Obama and Catholics in America In 2009 the group applauded efforts by the Obama Administration to reach out to Catholics, particularly in a major policy address President Obama made at Georgetown University on April 14, 2009, and in his commencement address on May 17, 2009 at the University of Notre Dame. Catholic conservatives had attacked Notre Dame for inviting President Obama, going as far as to organize an alternate commencement rally that featured a speech by Fr. Bill Miscamble‚Äîa Notre Dame historian who later wrote a highly critical biography of Fr. Theodore Hesburgh. In response, Catholic Democrats wrote a national Letter of Support for President Obama, Notre Dame, and Catholic higher education that was signed by thousands of Catholics across the country. The group also launched the website, Catholics for Notre Dame, which housed the statement of support, a music video called Catholic in America, and a tool for individuals to send letters to the editor. They helped organize a reunion for the Catholic priests and community organizers who hired President Obama to work in a Catholic church rectory on the South Side of Chicago in 1985. The Catholic Democrats president, Dr. Patrick Whelan, defended the university's invitation to President Obama in an appearance on MSNBC's \\"Countdown\\" with Keith Olbermann, and he wrote an opinion piece that appeared the Friday before the Notre Dame Commencement in the Chicago Tribune. Catholic Democrats also worked with local Democratic officials in South Bend, Indiana the weekend of the commencement to organize a welcome rally for President Obama and a food drive, in the spirit of national service struck at the Inauguration. In the summer of 2009, Catholic Democrats launched the website, \\"Pope Greets Hope\\" to celebrate President Obama's first meeting with Pope Benedict XVI on July 11, 2009. Dr. Whelan blogged from the Vatican during the meeting, which followed the release of the papal encyclical Caritas in Veritate and the 35th G8 summit in L'Aquila, Italy, earlier in the week. In August 2009, the organization paid tribute to the late U.S. Senator Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who had been a great inspiration to the founders of the group. The group has more recently paid tribute to Sargent Shriver, a founder of the Peace Corps, and Fr. Thomas Kaminski, a Chicago priest who was president of the community development organization that hired Barack Obama in 1985. In September 2009, the leadership of Catholic Democrats met with the White House Domestic Policy Council in an effort to find creative and constructive solutions to decreasing the number of abortions in the United States. Catholic Democrats and health care reform In 2010, Catholic Democrats president Dr. Patrick Whelan published a study that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine and asserted that the number of abortions in Massachusetts decreased after the 2006 passage of universal health care there. Additionally, national director Steve Krueger wrote a policy paper on health care and abortion. Catholic Democrats also sent a letter to all Catholic members of the U.S. Congress asking them to give up divisive partisan rhetoric for Lent and to pass health care reform by Easter. Additionally, the organization asked Catholics to sign a petition that called on Congress to pass health care reform. Further embracing the cause of poverty and the disparity of wealth in America For the 2010 midterm elections, Catholic Democrats issued A Catholic Pledge to America, which called on Catholic voters to support candidates whose policies reflect Catholic social justice. Additionally, the organization issued a voter's guide that contrasted the accomplishments of the Democratic Congress with the Republican Pledge to America. National director Steve Krueger and board member Kathleen Kennedy Townsend appeared on the PBS program Religion & Ethics Newsweekly. In July 2011, Mr. Krueger became president of Catholic Democrats. In the fall of 2011 as the presidential primaries approached, Catholic Democrats sent a letterhttp://www.catholicdemocrats.org/BishopsandPoverty.pdf to then- Archbishop Timothy Dolan, president of the USCCB, detailing the theological flaws in arguments by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-WI) in favor of a federal austerity budget that proposed drastic cuts in healthcare, food stamps, and other services for the poor. The organization asked the U.S. bishops to vigorously address the challenges of increased poverty, unemployment and income inequality, and to reaffirm the principles that the U.S. bishops unambiguously laid out in the 1980s and again in the 1990s in their pastoral letter, Economic Justice for All. Archbishop Dolan repliedhttp://www.catholicdemocrats.org/Dolanletter.pdf in a letter to the leaders of Catholic Democrats, ‚ÄúOne of the reasons defense of religious liberty is such a high priority is because this is necessary to protect our efforts in the promotion of charity, justice, peace, service, and advocacy. Likewise, I worry when any attempt to dialogue with Republicans is interpreted as turning one‚Äôs back on the poor. Nevertheless, I very much welcome your comments and have taken them seriously.‚Äù In part because all the Republican presidential candidates opposed the administration's job creation and anti- poverty proposals, and chose to attack expanded healthcare access, Catholic Democrats became deeply involved in the 2012 presidential election. According to Archbishop Charles Chaput of Philadelphia, responding to a question from Dr. Whelan at a public forum at Assumption College in Worcester, the US bishops did not have time at their upcoming November 2011 meeting to discuss the plight of the poor and the state of the national economy. But the bishops did spend the majority of that meeting planning and launching a campaign against the Obama Administration centered on the idea that the government was responsible for an attack on religious liberty. That campaign focused on gay marriage, and later on whether employees of Catholic hospitals and universities should have insurance coverage for contraception. In a February 2012 interview on C-SPAN, Catholic Democrats Board member Kathleen Kennedy Townsend strongly supported the administration's efforts to provide wider access to contraceptives, with their potential for decreasing the number of abortions. But in an opinion piece the same week in the Philadelphia Inquirer, Archbishop Chaput said that the administration was motivated by ‚Äúa seemingly deep distrust of the formative role religious faith has on personal and social conduct, and a deep distaste for religion's moral influence on public affairs.‚Äù The Inquirer subsequently interviewed Catholic Democrats‚Äô president Steve Krueger, and reported this exchange of views with Archbishop Chaput: ‚ÄúWhile there's nothing wrong with a Catholic bishop being a Republican or a Democrat,‚Äù Krueger said, ‚Äúthere's something eerily unsettling when the archbishop's political affiliation and the teaching authority he rightfully claims conflate, so that he becomes more of a partisan political figure than a shepherd.\\" Told of Krueger's criticism, Chaput became visibly annoyed and leaned forward in his chair. \\"Can a group that calls itself 'Catholic Democrats' talk about politicizing things? That's absolutely ridiculous.\\" Asked if he had a preferred candidate in the presidential elections, Chaput allowed a small smile and shook his head. \\"I don't talk about candidates,\\" he said. \\"I just talk about the issues.‚Äù Catholic Democrats took to the air on Public Radio, syndicated Spanish-language radio, and the mainstream print media to support the United States Department of Health and Human Services decision to provide broader access to contraception. Columnist Bill Press, citing Catholic Democrats‚Äô concerns about the bishops‚Äô neglect for poverty- related issues, wrote in April 2012, ‚ÄúWhen I was growing up a Catholic, the nuns had a phrase for those who obeyed some tenets of the Church but not others: ‚ÄòCafeteria Catholics.‚Äô Today, the biggest ‚ÄòCafeteria Catholics‚Äô are Catholic bishops.‚Äù Catholic Democrats opposed the use of churches to support the Republican presidential ticket. In a study of the matter, Catholic Democrats estimated that the commercial communications value of the USCCB's unprecedented \\"religious liberty\\" campaign in 2012 was likely to fall between $60 million and $100 million, based on the estimated percentage of partisan homilies heard by the 26 million Catholics attending mass each week. ‚ÄúIf the USCCB were a Super PAC, the value of its campaign would likely top the list of independent expenditure organizations,‚Äù said Mr. Krueger in the Huffington Post. Also in 2012, Catholic Democrats opposed efforts to politicize Catholic parishes by reaching out directly to all the parishes in Governor Romney's home state of Massachusetts and in the battleground state of Virginia, outlining for pastors the USCCB's own guidelines forbidding electioneering by political parties in Catholic parishes. Gov. Romney chose U.S. Representative Paul Ryan, a Catholic, as his running mate in August 2012. Catholic Democrats pointed out the inconsistencies between Rep Ryan's previous budget proposals and the Catholic ‚Äúpreferential option for the poor,‚Äù citing opposition from a wide array of Catholic theologians and other professors, Catholic nuns, and Bishops Stephen Blaire and Howard Hubbard. ‚ÄúThe selection of U.S. Representative Paul Ryan as Mitt Romney‚Äôs running mate puts the Ryan budget, the role of the Catholic Social Justice Tradition, and the ways we as a society can help the poor at the center of this campaign,‚Äù said Professor Nick Cafardi, a member of the board of Catholic Democrats. When Rep. Ryan met Vice President Joseph Biden in a historic televised debate between two Catholic vice presidential candidates, Catholic Democrats hosted debate watch parties across the country preceded by a roundtable conference call discussion featuring Sr. Simone Campbell of Network, Dean Cafardi, and Dr. Whelan from Catholic Democrats. The focus of that discussion was rising poverty and the differences between the two campaigns on strategies to accelerate the recovery of the U.S. economy. ‚ÄúAmerica Undecided: Catholic, Independent and Social Justice Perspectives on Election 2012\\" In the fall of 2012, Dr. Whelan joined forces with two former University of Notre Dame law professors and law school deans, Douglas Kmiec and Ed Gaffney, to write the book ‚ÄúAmerica Undecided: Catholic, Independent and Social Justice Perspectives on Election 2012.‚Äùhttp://www.catholicdemocrats.org/cfo/au.pdf Prof Gaffney is a religious liberty scholar and Prof Kmiec a nationally known constitutional law expert. They argued that there was no merit to the idea that the Obama administration was opposed to religious liberty or hostile to Catholicism. The book begins by chronicling the Catholic influence on the early life of President Barack Obama, who attended Catholic school in Jakarta Indonesia as a child. His mother, Ann Dunham, worked collaboratively for 20 years with a Dutch Jesuit in a Catholic vocational school in Jakarta, trying to advance the economic prospects of a population emerging there from colonialism. Dr. Whelan interviewed a group of Catholic priests who had hired Mr. Obama in 1985 to work in Chicago Catholic parishes as a community organizer. The book goes on to explore the details of the USCCB‚Äôs turnabout on the expansion of health insurance availability, and ultimately their opposition to the historic 2010 Affordable Care Act. It discusses the role of nuns such as Sr. Simone Campbell of Network and Sr. Carol Keehan of the Catholic Health Association of the United States in ultimately helping pass the legislation, and the subsequent efforts by the Church to censure the nuns. Finally, it explores the details of the Church‚Äôs opposition to the contraception mandate, and their mislabeling of some contraceptives as ‚Äúabortifacients.‚Äù They debunk the idea that the government's efforts to provide contraception coverage to all women, including those who work for Catholic hospitals and universities, constitutes an attack on religious freedom or a violation of the Constitution's separation of church and state. A subsequent opinion piece in October 2012 by Dr. Whelan and Catholic Democrats Board member Kathleen Kennedy Townsend explored Governor Romney's opposition to providing healthcare coverage for all Americans. President Obama and Vice-President Biden prevailed over Gov Romney and Rep Ryan, 51-47%, in the general popular vote. Catholics were as likely as the general population to vote for President Obama, with exit polling showing 51% supporting the Democrats and 48% for the Republican ticket. The Catholic majority for Obama was heavily dependent on Latino Catholics, who supported Obama 76-23%. Romney won among non-Hispanic white Catholics 56 to 43%. This contrasted with non-Hispanic white Protestants who favored Romney 69-29%. By comparison, Obama won the 2008 election with 53% of the general vote, compared with 46% for Senator John McCain. Catholics voted for Obama 54 to 45%, with non-Hispanic white Catholics favoring McCain 52 to 47% and Latino Catholic favoring Obama 72 ‚Äì 26%. Exit polls have shown a progressive drop in non- Hispanic white Catholics over each of the last four elections as a percentage of those who voted, though the overall percentage of Catholics among voters has held constant at 27%. Catholics and racial justice In August 2013, Catholic Democrats teamed up with leaders from the US Bishops‚Äô Office of African American Affairs, the Catholic Campaign for Human Development, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington, and other Catholic organizations to host an event in conjunction with the 50th commemoration of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.‚Äôs speech \\"I Have a Dream\\". An opening mass of celebration featured the Gospel Choir of Holy Redeemer Parish in Washington DC, with a homily by Fr. David Bava surveying the history of Catholic efforts related to slavery and civil rights. A wide-ranging discussion entitled, ‚ÄúA Catholic Conversation on Race, Religion and the March on Washington‚Äù was moderated by Ralph McCloud, the director of the USCCB's Catholic Campaign for Human Development. The discussants included United States Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez, National Pax Christi USA President Sr. Patricia Chappell, John Carr (Director of the Initiative on Catholic Social Thought & Public Life at Georgetown University), and USCCB Assistant Director for African American Affairs Donna Toliver Grimes. The event filled Holy Redeemer Church, and was well-received as the only public celebration of the role of Catholics in the Civil Rights Movement. Catholic Democrats President Krueger, who conceived the event, was quoted in the National Catholic Reporter, saying it \\"was intended to be a bridge between Catholic involvement in the civil rights movement of the 1960s and the unfinished business of the 1963 march today based on the Catholic social justice tradition. It is a 'next first step' on a journey that we hope may serve as an impetus for a national conversation on racial justice in parishes, dioceses and faith-based communities across our land.\\" Catholic Political Involvement In 2014, Catholic Democrats conducted a Get Out the Vote (GOTV) campaign asking Catholic voters to consider the moral messages of Pope Francis, and his focus on poverty, as they were preparing to vote in the 2014 midterm elections. The organization produced radio advertisements featuring James Roosevelt, Jr., the grandson of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt, and Martin Sheen. The radio ads were played on Pandora Internet radio in the states of Kentucky and New Hampshire. The radio ads were a part of Catholic Democrats' 2014 \\"Be Connected\\" campaign. Pandora rated these advertisements as among the highest rated political ads for 2014 in terms of listener engagement. Catholic Democrats hosted a national conference call on the eve of Pope Francis's visit to the United States in September 2015, featuring Sr. Mary Johnson, SND, PhD, Distinguished Prof. of Sociology and Religious Studies at Trinity Washington University, and Fr. Tom Reese SJ, of the National Catholic Reporter. The group launched a prayer petition for the pope, and President Steve Krueger represented the organization at the White House reception for Pope Francis. In 2016 Catholic Democrats supported the candidacy of Secretary Hillary Clinton for President. Although she appears to have won the overall Catholic vote, according to a research center at Georgetown University, she ended up losing the non-Hispanic white Catholic vote‚Äîwhich may have played a pivotal role in the loss of traditional Democratic Midwestern states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania that have large and older Catholic populations. Catholics tend to vote in higher numbers than the general population, which may have contributed to an outsized effect of the white Catholic preference for Donald Trump. Professor Thomas Groome of Boston College published an opinion piece in The New York Times arguing that the Democrats need to reach out to people of faith on the abortion issue by championing their successful efforts to decrease abortions dramatically through the eight years of the Obama presidency. His essay inspired more than 2500 comments, and the Times published a Q&A; with responses by Professor Groome and Steven Krueger, president of Catholic Democrats. '' Because Catholic Democrats has long championed greater access to health care as a right advocated by Pope Francis and the Catholic Social Justice tradition, the group mobilized its members in opposition to Republican efforts to overturn the Affordable Care Act. The American Health Care Act (AHCA, Ryan healthcare bill) was withdrawn from consideration in the House of Representatives on March 24, 2017, preserving health insurance for 25 million people who otherwise would have lost it, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Responding to the child abuse allegations made against Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, Catholic Democrats undertook an advertising campaign appealing to Catholics in Alabama to respond forcefully to the lessons learned from the Catholic clergy abuse crisis, and to support Moore's opponent Democrat Doug Jones. On December 12, 2017, former US Attorney Doug Jones won an upset victory over Moore in the special election to fill the seat vacated by US Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

Karpoff, MD and others) and one member of the faculty, Martin Nachbar, MD (1937-2015). It was one of the early adopters of the use of computers and multimedia in education. Courseware was created, such as a computerized atlas of Histology in HyperCard and a multidimensional Neuroanatomy Atlas using SuperCard. Software expanded to include other courseware, digitized video, and 3-d simulations of surgery, such as Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy. The Hippocrates Project also created early versions of the electronic medical record. As of 1997, the Hippocrates Project is officially an Educational Computing Division (ECD).Division of Educational Informatics Accomplishments Hippocrates has produced over 100 \\"medical education modules\\", most of which are used in NYU curricula as exercises or as educational resources.

It is similar to Ribes √ó culverwellii, the Jochelbeere, which is descended from just two of these species, R. nigrum and R. uva-crispa. Taxonomy There was a demand to have gooseberry-type fruits on thornless plants, and the first successful attempt to cross blackcurrant (R. nigrum) with European gooseberry (R. uva-crispa) was carried out by Culverwell in Yorkshire, England in 1880. This hybrid was termed Ribes √ó culverwellii and was nearly sterile. Others later carried out direct crosses between blackcurrant and gooseberry, however the diploid seedlings created were sterile and did not produce much fruit, although some fruit was set without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Jostaberry is frequently mistakenly termed Ribes √ó culverwelli as a result of this early F1 diploid hybrid. However, Jostaberry is a F2 fertile amphipolyploid hybrid of complex parentage, not a direct cross, and was created later in Germany. Paul Lorenz started the process in the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin in 1926. In 13 years, over 1000 F1 hybrids were created. Only eight of these survived World War II, and were eventually moved to the Erwin Baeur Institute, which was founded in 1946. Randolph Baeur used colchicine to double the number of chromosomes and produce fertile tetraploids. Backcrossing with gooseberry and blackcurrant parents was also involved, creating a new F2 generation. Of 15,000 such crosses, three seedlings were selected based on vigor, disease resistance and fertility. Therefore, jostaberry is descended from two separate first-generation crosses, both of which produced very few fruit. One of the F1 hybrids used was a cross between the blackcurrant cultivar R. nigrum ‚ÄòLangtraubige Schwarze‚Äô (‚ÄòLong Bunch‚Äô) with R. divaricatum (also termed spreading gooseberry, Worcesterberry, coastal black gooseberry or by other names). This F1 hybrid was resitant to American gooseberry mildew. The other F1 hybrid parent was a cross between the blackcurrant cultivar R. nigrum \\"Silvergieters Schwarze\\" with R. grossularia (syn. R. uva-crispa) ‚ÄòGrune Hansa‚Äô. The name Jostaberry was created by combining the German words for blackcurrant and gooseberry, namely Johannisbeere (\\"Jo\\") and Stachelbeere (\\"Sta\\"). Following German pronunciation of \\"J\\", it may be pronounced \\"yostaberry\\" in English. The first cultivar, ‚ÄòJosta‚Äô was made available to the public in 1977. Two later cultivars released were called ‚ÄòJostine‚Äô and ‚ÄòJogranda‚Äô. A number of varieties have been developed since then by various developers. Most named cultivars tend to only be available in Germany, and the names of the three most common jostaberry cultivars have also been confused, and all have sometimes been sold as ‚ÄòJosta‚Äô. Additionally, several jostaberry varieties were developed independently from European breeding efforts at the USDA Agricultural Research Service unit in Corvallis, Oregon. Unlike European jostaberry selections, these varieties are quite thorny. These are called the \\"ORUS\\" series and some of them such as \\"ORUS 8\\" are still available today. Description The nearly black berry, which is smaller than a gooseberry and a bit larger than a blackcurrant, is edible both raw and cooked. It is described as having a taste intermediate between a gooseberry and a blackcurrant, with the gooseberry flavor more dominant in the unripe fruit, and the blackcurrant notes developing as the fruit ripens. The ripe fruit will hang on the bush in good condition through late summer, but is very popular with birds. The somewhat unripe fruit can be used in cooking recipes as a gooseberry. Like blackcurrants the fruit freezes well, and like many other members of the genus Ribes it is rich in vitamin C. Commercial production of jostaberries is limited because they are not well suited to mechanical harvesting. Compared to most other fruits, harvesting jostaberries is relatively labor-intensive per kilogram. Although harder to pluck than blackcurrants, the plant is thornless. The plant itself grows to a maximum height of about 2 m, flowering in mid-spring, with fruit setting and ripening on a similar timetable to the blackcurrant. The plant displays hybrid vigor, growing and fruiting well and being resistant to a number of common diseases afflicting other Ribes. In particular the plant is resistant to American gooseberry mildew, blackcurrant leaf spot, white pine blister rust, and big bud gall mite. Flowers are hermaphrodite and the plant is self-fertile following insect pollination. Propagation is usually by cuttings, rather than by seeds.

The Pool created a network of marketing alliances in North America and internationally which made it the largest agricultural grain handling operation in the province of Saskatchewan. Before becoming Viterra, SWP had operated 276 retail outlets and more than 100 grain handling and marketing centres. The Saskatchewan Wheat Pool operated under the name of AgPro in the prairie provinces of Manitoba and Alberta. Begun as a co-operative in the 1920s, the company became a publicly traded corporation in the 1990s. After the 2007 takeover of its competitor, Winnipeg- based Agricore United, the Pool name was retired. The merged company operated under the name Viterra until 2013, when it was acquired by Glencore International. Establishment and growth Saskatchewan Wheat Pool contracts. Melville, decorated for King George VI and Queen Elizabeth for the 1939 royal tour of Canada. Gainsborough. Saskatchewan Wheat Pool logo on the Weyburn concrete terminal elevator Farmers, frustrated in their attempts to win a fair price for their wheat, started to look to various marketing systems between 1900 and 1920. The co-operative style of organizing farm operations was one of them. As early as 1902, farmers banded together as the Territorial Grain Growers' Association. The TGGA split into Alberta Farmers' Association and the Saskatchewan Grain Growers' Association (SGGA) in 1906. Also established at this time was the farmers' co-operative elevator company called the Grain Growers' Grain Company (GGGC), which later merged into the United Grain Growers. In 1911 the Saskatchewan Co-operative Elevator Company was formed. The SGGA met with the United Farmers of Alberta and United Farmers of Manitoba and formed the Saskatchewan Co-operative Wheat Producers Ltd. on August 25, 1923. Informally it was known as the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, as it collectively helped farmers to obtain a decent price for wheat. The first president was Alexander James McPhail, and the first grain elevator was built in Bulyea in 1925 (in the area of Section 36, Township 16, Range 15, W of the 2nd meridian). The Saskatchewan Co-operative Wheat Producers Ltd. bought out the Saskatchewan Co-operative Elevator Company in 1926. In 1953 The Saskatchewan Co-operative Wheat Producers Ltd. was renamed the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool. The Wheat Pool elevators have been sentinels in many prairie towns since the early 1900s. They are the topic of numerous prairie landscapes and photographs. The Wheat Pool calendar map or Country Elevator System calendar maps were a mainstay of many pioneer households. These calendar maps depicted the networking of the early CNR and CPR rail lines, the many early incorporated areas, and the locations of the grain elevators. The pictures which surround the elevator map of grain delivered by horse and wagon, early truck, and grain handling at the ports along the calendars show the evolution of the grain handling industry. Carnduff. In the early 20th century, grain elevators dotted the prairies every 6 to 10 miles (10‚Äì15 km) apart, a distance that was a good day's journey for farmer and horse with a full load. Farmers could find services available to buy and grade grain at the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool elevators. The Pool Farm Service Centers provided a place for farmers to pick up fertilizer and chemicals. Highways, trucks, tractors, and combines revolutionized the farming industry after World War II. These changes gradually led to the rail system facing deregulation and consolidation changes: many branch lines closed down, and there were increased loading quotas available to railcars for grain, specialty crops and even oilseeds. These developments led to newer and more advanced state-of-the-art grain handling systems called SWP Terminals which serve larger surrounding farming areas. The 'crib' style wood elevator of the 1920s could handle 100 tonnes of grain per hour. The elevator pit could contain approximately 10 tonnes of grain, which would be about the load delivered by one farmer's grain truck. In comparison, the new \\"high-throughput\\" elevators constructed of slip-formed cylindrical concrete have a 418,000 bushel (11,500 tonne) capacity, whereas the condominium storage facility can contain 582,000 bushels (15,800 tonnes). Co-operative to corporation Sask Pool 7, Thunder Bay In March 1996, the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool became a publicly traded company, breaking from its roots as a co-operative. While decent profits were realized in the first two years, the company incurred huge losses between 1999 and 2003 because of low commodity prices. It also faced increased competition when the Alberta Wheat Pool and Manitoba Pool Elevators merged to form Agricore. The Pool lost its position as the country's top grain handler when Agricore took over United Grain Growers in 2002 to form Agricore United. In November 2006, the company launched a campaign to take over Agricore United. Winnipeg-based James Richardson International (\\"JRI\\") launched its own takeover bid at the same time. The initial and subsequent offers from the Pool involved a stock swap, with no or little cash being offered, prompting the AU Board of Directors to reject them. In February 2007, AU and JRI announced that they had negotiated a merger arrangement to form a publicly traded company to be known as \\"Richardson Agricore\\", subject to shareholder agreement. A subsequent bidding war led to a stock and cash offer from the Pool and an all-cash offer from JRI to form a private company; a higher, $20.50 all-cash offer from the Pool in May eventually prevailed, with 81% of the limited voting shares being tendered to the Pool by shareholders by the end of May, including all the ADM shares. This exceeded the 75% required by the terms of AU's incorporation to change the corporate structure and, after a special shareholders' meeting in June, AU became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool. AU's CEO, Brian Hayward, resigned, as did the Board of Directors, and the Pool's CEO and Board were voted in. The Pool had Agricore United's common and preferred shares delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) on June 20, 2007, and the members of the senior management team for the amalgamated company were announced the next day. The new company was headquartered in Regina, under the name of Viterra. Presidents * A. E.

It was developed under the direction of John Smedley at Verant Interactive and published by Sony Interactive Studios America. Originally titled Armorgeddon, Verant was forced to change the name when another game with that name was discovered. It was released in late 1997. The game was included in Sony Online Entertainment's Station Exchange program in 2007, and shut down in June 2010. Gameplay Game arenas (also known as \\"maps\\") allowed up to four teams to play at the same time. Each team could contain up to five players. Most of the arenas were created by the player community, although the maps had to be hosted by Sony Online, who would rotate the maps on a monthly basis. Upon joining the arena, each player selected a tank to operate from the five models available. The tank would then be customized through the utilization of various weapons and support modules. Numerous combinations could be used, contingent on what the player wished to do (capture other teams' flags or fight, for example). The player may have then switched tank models during the game by using one of their base's recon stations. Players saw the Tanarus world through the tank's gun turret. There was no set objective in Tanarus, though the game presented various goals of team-based combat: Generally, to destroy the other colors' tanks, capture recon stations to provide a tactical or strategic advantage, and, finally, to capture another team's flag, bringing it back to their own base, thus destroying everyone on that team.  Reception  The game garnered few but positive reviews. GameSpot's Chris Gregson concluded \\"Some might think $9.95 per month is a little pricey for a single game - that's what Kesmai charges for all of its sundry online-only games on GameStorm, for example - but they need to remember that there's really no other game online like this one. And if it gets its hooks in you, you'll probably consider the price a bargain.\\", awarding Tanarus a score of 8/10. Next Generation reviewed the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Tanarus isn't the greatest value for everybody, but for those with the persistence and skill to become good at the game, it's worth the time and money.\\" References Category:1997 video games Category:Multiplayer online games Category:North America-exclusive video games Category:Sony Interactive Entertainment games Category:Tank simulation video games Category:Video games scored by George Sanger Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ","title":"Tanarus (video game)"},{"id":"8025860","text":"KCII may refer to: * KCII (AM), a radio station (1380 AM) licensed to Washington, Iowa, United States * KCII-FM, a radio station (106.1 FM) licensed to Washington, Iowa, United States * Choteau Airport (ICAO code KCII) ","title":"KCII"},{"id":"8025880","text":"Na'im Akbar is a clinical psychologist well known for his Afrocentric approach to psychology. He is a distinguished scholar, public speaker, and author. Akbar entered the world of Black psychology in the 1960s, as the Black Power Movement was gaining momentum. In the 1970s, Akbar published his first critiques of the Eurocentric psychological tradition, asserting that this model maintained the intellectual oppression of African Americans. Akbar criticized the pathology perspectives that had taken over as the dominant literature on African Americans. Many of his major works involved mental health among African Americans. Biography Na‚Äôim Akbar, originally named Luther Benjamin Weems Jr., was born on April 26, 1944, in Tallahassee, Florida. He attended the Florida A & M University Laboratory School, an all- Black school, from kindergarten through high school, and graduated from high school in 1961. As a child of Black middle class parents, Akbar was in an unusual situation at the time as both of his parents were college educated, a rare circumstance for a Black child growing up at the time. His childhood was spent in a segregated southern community in Tallahassee, but he lived in a unique community where ‚Äúacademic excellence was the unquestioned standard‚Äù. At a time when Black people lived in both socially and economically oppressed segregated communities, this emphasis on academic excellence was fairly uncommon. Upon graduating high school, Akbar moved on to the University of Michigan, where he completed his B.A. in Psychology, M.A. in Clinical Psychology, and Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology. Heavily influenced by the Black student movement at the University of Michigan, and freshly aware of racial tensions (his freshman year at Michigan marked his first personal contact with Whites), Akbar became active with the Black Action Movement (BAM) strike which shut down classes at the University of Michigan for three weeks in the late 1960s. His experiences at Michigan helped to set the stage for Akbar to start questioning the normative status quo approach to psychology, which was dominant at the time. Akbar relates that the environment at Michigan lead to ‚Äúthe early conversations that we began to have about a ‚ÄòBlack Psychology‚Äô, and to deconstruct the psychology that we had been taught‚Äù. Working towards his Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology, Akbar wrote a dissertation called \\"Power Themes among Negro and White Paranoid and non-Paranoid Schizophrenics\\". In his dissertation, Akbar sought to define and explore the distinctive literature discussing definitions of psychology and mental health for Black people. Through this work, Akbar began to seriously question many of the accepted definitions of mental health for Black people, which had their genesis in European American psychology. Akbar credits this time in his career as the defining point about which his future work would be forged. After obtaining his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan, Akbar moved to Atlanta to work for the psychology department at Morehouse College, a historically Black college. At Morehouse, Akbar designed and taught the first Black psychology course in the history of the college, and eventually developed the first Black psychology program at the college. After two years of working at Morehouse, Akbar was named chair of the Psychology Department there. Three years later, Akbar left Morehouse to work at the Nation of Islam's headquarters in Chicago. Around this time, Akbar changed his name to Luther X, after joining the Nation of Islam and then later to Na‚Äôim Akbar after joining the Muslim American Community of Imam Warith Deen Mohammed then named \\"The World Community of Al- Islam in The West\\". Akbar created the Office of Human Development, where he remained for two years until he went back to teaching and accepted a position at Norfolk State University, a historically Black university located in Norfolk, Virginia. As an associate professor at Norfolk, Akbar crafted and taught courses in Black psychology. Akbar then moved on to accept a faculty position at Florida State University back in his hometown of Tallahassee, Florida, where he continued to teach courses in Black psychology. In 1971, Akbar joined the Association of Black Psychologists (ABPsi), which is the largest professional organization with focuses on Black mental health in the world. Since becoming active in the organization, Akbar has served on the board numerous times, and served as the President of the ABPsi from 1987 to 1988. Additionally, Akbar has served on the editorial board of the Journal of Black Studies and was the associate editor of the Journal of Black Psychology for eight years. After teaching at Florida State University for 28 years, Akbar retired in 2008 so that he could put more time and effort into his role as the president of his private consulting and publishing company. Akbar created the private consulting company, Na‚Äôim Akbar Consultants, and the publishing company, Mind Productions, in the late 1980s in efforts to broaden his teaching audience. Throughout his career, Akbar has become a distinguished author, writing numerous books and speaking publicly to share his expertise at conferences and interviews. His major contributions to the field of psychology have been centered on the topics of developing an African-centered approach in modern psychology ‚Äì which for Akbar involves the deconstruction of Eurocentric psychological thought and the subsequent reconstruction/construction of an African psychology that includes the specific historical and cultural experiences of African Americans. Other key topics in Akbar's life work involving the African American family and relationships, cultural diversity, and the Afro-centric perspective. Mental Disorder Among African Americans (1991)  In his 1991 paper ‚ÄúMental Disorder Among African Americans,‚Äù Akbar maintains his Afro-centric view of psychology, and criticizes the Euro-centric normative definitions of mental illness that were historically used to classify and label numbers of African Americans as mentally ill. Akbar called this abuse ‚Äúintellectual oppression,‚Äù and argued that African Americans should create their own definitions of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù that made meaningful use of an African worldview and was culturally relevant to African Americans. Akbar attributed the failure of society to question these white normative traditions to a phenomenon he called ‚Äúdemocratic sanity,‚Äù which he paralleled to a majority-rules system. Historically, normality was understood as a function of the behaviors of the majority of the people; thus, when judging African Americans with reference to the behaviors of the dominant class, any deviations in behavior may be considered insane. Akbar subsequently raises questions about the standards used to judge the sanity of African Americans and maintained that cultural considerations were necessary to adequately assess the mental health of African Americans. In this paper, Akbar identifies four categories of mental illness among African Americans: # The Alien-Self Disorder # The Anti-Self Disorder # The Self Destructive Disorders # Organic Disorders According to Akbar, the ‚Äúalien-self‚Äù disorder is characterized by an individual who rejects their own natural dispositions, and thereby acts in detriment to their survival. This individual is materialistic and denies the social realities of their social and political oppression. He/She attempts to ‚Äúlive in a dream world,‚Äù without acknowledging racism, and thus lives in conflict with their true identity. Such an afflicted individual often tries to live as though he/she were a member of the dominant class; he/she seeks to join exclusive clubs and live in exclusive neighborhoods. As a result, this individual ultimately belongs to neither the dominant (European American), nor oppressed (African American) groups, and thus commits himself to a life of identity confusion and ultimately loneliness. The ‚Äúanti-self‚Äù disorder is similar to the alien-self disorder, but goes a step further and actively holds negative impressions and views of his group. Individuals with this disorder ‚Äúrepresent the true ‚Äòcolonized mentality,‚Äô‚Äù meaning that they so desire to be part of the dominant group that they take on their very views and dispositions to the detriment of the individual‚Äôs group of origin. According to Akbar, the danger in this disorder is that individuals feel comfortable with their alien identification, and are thus unlikely to seek help. Akbar relates that the anti-self disorder is worse than the alien-self disorder, because the individual with the anti-self disorder is more out of contact with reality and is thus more disturbed. According to Akbar, ‚Äúvictims of self-destructive disorders are the most direct victims of oppression‚Äù because oppression is unnatural and inhuman and thus drives the oppressed away from reality. Those with self-destructive disorders try to survive in the hostile environment that oppression creates, but ultimately fail and become self-defeating. These individuals have failed to survive and grow within the society, which systematically oppresses them, and resorts to self-deprecating tactics like doing drugs or becoming a prostitute. Akbar believes that black-on-black crime is a result of self-destructive disorders, and posits that alcoholics and druggies resort to a world of chemical fantasies instead of dealing with their own realities. Organic disorders derive from physiological, neurological, or biochemical failures. Individuals belonging to this group of disorders are severely mentally defective, and overlap greatly with disorders traditionally recognized as schizophrenia. Although traditionally viewed as a physical condition, Akbar posits that organic disorders may stem in part from a disordered and defective environment. According to Akbar, ‚Äúthe oppressive system remains the essential cause of mental disorder within the African American community.‚Äù Akbar relates that the trend towards charging all types of mental illnesses as organic in nature is merely an effort to downplay the influence of society on mental stability. The African American practitioner must therefore consider such societal influences on mental conditions and look at the social, political, and historical contexts of the patient in considering diagnosis and treatment. Akbar concludes that the creation of an African American definition of normalcy is necessary, and until such a definition is formed, African Americans remain subjects to the power and authority of the dominant community. Nigrescence and Identity: Some Limitations In this reaction paper to William E. Cross Jr.‚Äôs Nigrescence Model of African American identity development, Akbar reviews some of the limitations that he sees in the model and others articles that have expanded upon Cross‚Äô model. Akbar notes that Cross‚Äô theory was drafted as a reaction to the sociopolitical environment at the time, specifically his observations that African Americans in the 1960s began changing their self-perceptions and social behaviors. As such, Akbar relates that Cross‚Äô theory must be understood as a reaction to this phenomenon. Akbar's two major qualms with Cross‚Äô theory, and the related papers by Parham and Helms, is that 1) the model fails to account for the view that the Black identity is the core context of the self, and 2) the model fails to account for the centrality of spirituality in conceptualization of the Black personality, a crucial element in the Afro- centric perspective. Akbar also takes issue with the idea that a secure Black identity was realized when the African American became comfortable forging relationships with members of other ethnic groups and cultures. According to Akbar, it makes more sense if a secure Black identity was evident when one was comfortable establishing and maintaining relationships with one's own racial/cultural group members. He likened Cross‚Äô reasoning to an adoption of the alien-self disorder, and argued that Cross‚Äô assumption was flawed. Additionally, Akbar discussed a potential alternative path of identity formation, not addressed in Cross‚Äô model ‚Äì the affirmation of one's racial/cultural identity through a positive, rather than a negative encounter. He cited the example of Malcolm X's ‚Äúreal‚Äù immersion, which he argues came 20 years after his encounter. This immersion was a result of spiritual change and a personal commitment to the teachings of Elijah Muhammed. Akbar argues that such a path results in a natural emergence of racial/cultural identity, rather than the forced emergence of an identity after a negative encounter. Akbar goes on to say that this positive encounter seems to lead to a more stable identity formation that the one that emerges from a negative encounter, and he cites Malcolm X and W.E.B. Du Bois as examples of this phenomenon. Akbar also addresses some of the relevant issues regarding Cross‚Äô model of Nigrescence and its translation to counseling. Akbar relates that the major unresolved issue for counseling purposes is a problem of definitional clarity. Different counseling solutions are dependent on the perceived cause of African American identity formation; identity formation as a result of a negative encounter or negative social experiences should result in different counseling from identity formation due to a positive encounter, or the affirmation of one's racial/cultural core identity. Visions for Black Men (1991)  In \\"Visions for Black Men,\\" written in 1991, Akbar relates the necessity for Black men to rise to their full potential as leaders in the home and in the community. Akbar wrote the book to try and empower Black men worldwide to become self- determined and fulfill their due roles in society. In the book, Akbar makes a careful distinction between being a male and being a man. To be a man, Akbar relates, is to be conscious of themselves, their actions, and their environments, and to take responsibility for their actions and inactions. Akbar refers to Marcus Garvey, Elijah Muhammad, Warith Deen Mohammed, Booker T. Washington, Martin Luther King Jr., Paul Robeson, and Cheikh Anta Diop as examples of Black men who were leaders and advocates of change. \\"I'm trying to get you free\\" (2003) Akbar released this spoken word compact disk in 2003, with the goal of spreading his beliefs to a broader audience. When he states ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to get you free,‚Äù Akbar is referring to obtaining a collective freedom of the mind for African Americans. One of Akbar's key philosophies was that true freedom for African Americans was necessitated on a collective cultural perspective viewed from a framework that incorporated the historical and cultural experiences of African Americans. On this disk, Akbar relates such words as, ‚ÄúWe are a magical people;‚Äù ‚ÄúWe are not just Americans;‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you know what we been through in this land?‚Äù in attempts to convey that African Americans have a long and powerful history that they should be proud of. Awards and recognitions A distinguished scholar, author, and speaker, Dr. Na‚Äôim Akbar has accumulated numerous awards and recognitions throughout his career. He was awarded the Distinguished Psychologist Award from the National Association of Black Psychologists, and Honorary Doctorates of Humane Letters from Edinboro University in Pennsylvania and Lincoln University. Akbar has also be given commemorative days on his behalf in six major cities across the United States, and was named a Development Chief in Ghana, West Africa. Dr. Akbar has also served on the Boards of Directors of numerous organizations, including the National Association of Black Psychologists, for which he served as the president from 1987 to 1988. Akbar has been featured in newspapers and magazines both nationally and internationally, including The Washington Post and Essence Magazine.

() is an investor-owned utility based in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States. The company provides natural gas service to over 2 million residential, commercial, and industrial customers in parts of Arizona, Nevada, and California. __TOC__ History The company was founded in Barstow, California, in 1931, and soon expanded to the nearby town of Victorville. Natural gas was brought into southern Nevada in 1953, and Southwest Gas began service to the burgeoning communities of Las Vegas and Henderson the following year. On January 24, 1956, Southwest Gas Corporation became a publicly owned company. Expansion into Arizona occurred in 1957 with the acquisition of Natural Gas Service of Arizona. In 1963, with the completion of a 250-mile pipeline in northern Nevada, the company was able to grow once again by extending its service territory to include Carson City. Several years later it began serving customers as far west as Elko in the northern part of the state. Expansion also occurred during this time in California with expansion from its Victorville operations to Big Bear. During the next several decades the company made several more acquisitions and expanded in parts of its tri-state service territory. In 1979, the purchase of the gas system of what is now Tucson Electric Power, and the 1984 purchase of the gas system of Arizona Public Service Company, added the Phoenix area to the company‚Äôs customer base. During a time of unprecedented growth in the desert Southwest, Southwest Gas was serving some of the fastest-growing areas in the country. In 2005, the company acquired service territory in South Lake Tahoe from Avista, enabling it to serve customers contiguously around Lake Tahoe in California and Nevada. The company is the largest distributor of natural gas in Arizona and Nevada. The company received a 2010 ENERGY STAR Leadership in Housing Award from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The company's Smarter Greener Better campaign provides consumers with information that enables them to take advantage of money-saving programs related to energy efficiency.

The fraternity established local chapters in towns and cities across the United States. The chapters were run by a chapter president, known as the Grand Master, and other elected officers. The national fraternity was governed by an elected body of alumni known as the Grand Council. National conventions were held annually. History The history of Theta Kappa Omega Fraternity between 1872 and 1926 is very vague. During that period, the national headquarters were in the hands of Alpha, the oldest chapter. In 1899, all records were destroyed by a fire at Alpha, located at California Military Academy. =Founding= On November 13, 1872, three young men decided to meet to discuss the problem of one of their comrades. This fourth friend was of high moral character and was endowed with great intelligence. Although so blessed, he had little wealth and planned to soon discontinue his education since he could no longer pay all of his school expenses. That night, three young men pledged to each other that they would pay the expenses of their comrade to enable him to continue his higher education. In 1875, this beloved young friend graduated from the California academy, after having received help from his three companions for the past three years. He had decided that such unselfish, brotherly acts should continue, not ending with himself. He felt his friends' deed should be recognized; that young men of the future should endeavor to follow in their footsteps. To show his gratitude, and in an effort to insure the brotherly love and help should be extended to all deserving students, he organized an undergraduate group into a fraternity to continue in the first group's tradition. He selected the name of Theta Kappa Omega. This first chapter, Alpha Chapter of California Military Academy, was located in Mayfield, California. =Peaks and valleys= T.K.O. was at a peak between 1885 and 1905, but during the period 1915 through 1924, the lack of organization, poor leadership, and strict rules prevented any secret organization from expanding. There was, however, one installation - Beta Chapter, and when the California Military Academy ruled against fraternities, Alpha Chapter was dissolved, and Beta Chapter took over the national leadership. Beta's fate - a school ruling against fraternities - as Alpha's, made disbandment necessary, and finally Delta Chapter of Columbia Military Academy became the official national headquarters. All history concerning Beta and a subsequent chapter, Gamma, has been hopelessly lost. However, it is noted that Gamma Chapter ceased to exist before 1911. From past records, it is noted that on September 28, 1906, Charles Shamotulski and Carl T. McPheeters founded Delta Chapter at Columbia Military Academy. Between 1906 and 1911, little is known about the chapter. In 1911, William H. Riley was Grand Master of Delta, and therefore, the National President. The following year he transferred to Gulf Coast Military Academy where he installed Zeta Chapter in October, the first fraternity in that school. Delta Chapter is responsible for the installation of Chi and Epsilon Chapters at Atlanta, Georgia and also Alpha Beta at Memphis, Tennessee. These chapters were formed in a city rather than a school, an innovation for T.K.O., selecting outstanding boys of a town rather than the usual military boarding school. Chi Chapter was formerly Delta Tau Sigma Fraternity, a local, which was organized February 24, 1923. Immediately following their petition to Delta Chapter, H. Grayson Lambert, Jr., Delta Chapter Grand Master, and G. O. Melchor installed them into the bonds of T.K.O. The first Grand Master of Chi Chapter was Frank M. Boston. The other officers were Charles C. Romines, Master; Henry Brookour, Corresponding Secretary; John D. Grand, Sergeant-at- Arms. Bryant Shelnutt, the Grand Master in 1925-1926, was a charter member. Chi Chapter was admitted into the Pan Hellenic Council of Boy's High School soon after it became a chapter. Shortly after Chi Chapter was installed in Atlanta, Georgia, Epsilon Chapter was also founded there. This was the first time there existed two chapters of T.K.O in the same city. In September 1925, Warfield Rogers, H. Grayson Lambert, Jr., Harry Rogers, Grattan Brown, Herman Jorgenson, and Julian James met in Memphis, Tennessee and decided that in the best interest of their fraternity, the national headquarters should be moved from Delta Chapter of Columbia, Tennessee, to Memphis, Tennessee, and that the national work of the fraternity should be carried on by a body of alumni from three or more chapters, this body of men to be known as the Grand Council. =Expansion= Between 1925 and 1930, thirty-seven chapters were installed. In January 1928, the ritual and blackbook were printed and distributed by the Grand Council. In the same year, the official song of T.K.O. was written by Oscar Hurt and Julian James. The Endowment Fund of T.K.O. was established at the Biloxi Convention in 1933. Eight hundred dollars left from the administration of John Singreen was used to start the Endowment Fund, and ever since, Brother Singreen has served as its trustee. J.B. Hermon was instrumental in building the Fund during the years of 1934-1940 to about $3,000. Because of the great need for a revision of the blackbook, John Singreen revised it and the new blackbook was issued in February 1935. Brother Singreen also compiled the National Directory in 1932. =1940s and 1950s= The late forties were marked by some twenty active chapters, with the best attended conventions in its history. Some two hundred brothers gathered in Atlanta, Memphis, or New Orleans. Following this period, the early 1950s saw an increase in anti-fraternity activity, and subsequently, a reduction in the active chapters, with a low of eight in 1957. However, this period was certainly not without bright spots - the \\"Teke Echoes\\" became firmly established under the supervision of Jack Francis as the leading secondary fraternity publication; Tekes assumed leadership positions in the Inter- Fraternity Congress; and conventions were held in such places as New Orleans, Mobile, and Biloxi. The installation of Theta Gamma in 1959 signaled new success in the expansion efforts of the fraternity. The reactivation of Zeta Nu and Delta Epsilon and the installation of Theta Zeta, Theta Eta, and Theta Mu brought new zest to the fraternity and an era of greater acceptance of the role of fraternities began. =1960s= 1963 saw the Endowment Fund reach the long sought objective of $10,000. Because of financial inflation occurring in the nation, in 1967, T.K.O. raised its national dues from the original $40.00 per chapter, which had been established in 1925, to $60.00 per chapter. 1968 saw a second expansion wave starting with the installation of Theta Kappa, Theta Lambda, and Theta Nu. Fraternity symbols The original coat-of-arms showed the Griffin standing rampant, or, in full standing position, with a smaller shield, and the paw grasping the sword at a salute. In September 1925, the Grand Council changed from the original to the present one that displays a Maltese Cross, a sword, and a helmet upon the shield. From the top of the shield extends the head of an eagle, and above its head rests a crown. This coat-of-arms, together with the badge of membership, represents TKO's. The badge of membership is in the shape of a diamond with the Maltese Cross in the top corner. Across the middle, the Greek letters, Theta Kappa Omega are printed. Below that the Greek letters of the member's chapter are printed. Theta Kappa Omega is the only secondary fraternity which has the individual member chapter's Greek letters on its badge. The pledge pin is in the shape of a triangle with the Greek letters Theta Kappa Omega written across the bottom. The Greek letters are gold and the pin is completely black. The official song is \\"SWEETHEART of T.K.O.\\"; the words are written by Oscar Hurt and Julian James, and the music by Rupert Biggadike, recorded by Columbia Phonograph Co. in 1928, with music provided by Oscar Celestin and his original Tuxedo Band of New Orleans. The official flower of T.K.O. is the White Rose. The official colors of T.K.O. are black, white and gold.

Founded in 2001 and awarded Foundation status in 2004, the trust covers Sheffield's two major adult hospitals, the Northern General Hospital and the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, as well as the specialised Charles Clifford Dental, Jessop Wing and Weston Park hospitals. The chief executive of the trust is Kirsten Major, and the medical director is Dr David Hughes.  History  The origins of the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust can be traced back to the legislation under Section 5 of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990, enacted by statutory order in October 1991, which transferred control of medical care in the Sheffield area over from the Sheffield Health Authority to four separate NHS trusts with effect from 1 November 1991: the Central Sheffield University Hospitals NHS Trust (covering the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, the Jessop Hospital, Lodge Moor Hospital and Nether Edge Hospital); the Northern General Hospital NHS Trust; the Sheffield Children's NHS Trust; and the Weston Park Hospital NHS Trust. The trusts came into full operation on 1 April 1992, at which point the Sheffield Health Authority was dissolved. Lodge Moor Hospital closed in 1994, with its infectious diseases isolation section moving to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital and treatment of chest and spinal injuries transferring to the Northern General Hospital. That same year, the operation of Nether Edge Hospital was transferred to the newly-created Community Health Sheffield NHS Trust. Charles Clifford Dental Hospital was integrated within the Central Sheffield University Hospitals NHS Trust in 1995. On 1 April 1999, the Weston Park Hospital NHS Trust was merged into the Central Sheffield Universities NHS Trust, creating a major teaching hospital at the same time. In 2001, the Jessop Hospital for Women was closed and operations were transferred to the new Jessop Wing hospital adjacent to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital. The Central Sheffield University Hospitals NHS Trust and the Northern General Hospital NHS Trust were merged on 1 April 2001 to create the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, covering almost all major medical facilities (apart from paediatrics) in the city under a single trust. On 1 July 2004, the new trust was granted Foundation status, becoming the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the Sheffield Arena car park is being utilised as a drive- through phlebotomy service operated by the trust, the first of its kind in the country. This allows patients to attend for routine blood tests from within the isolation of their cars, reducing the requirement for patients to attend GPs or hospital clinics. The drive-through phlebotomy service opened on 8 April 2020 for patients with underlying health conditions, and was expanded to become available to all patients in the Sheffield area on 27 April. Facilities The organisation provides healthcare services for people in the Sheffield area and surrounding area of South Yorkshire and beyond. The trust provides a very wide range of specialities, and consists of two main parts. # The Central Campus, consisting of the Royal Hallamshire Hospital (a large acute hospital) together with its Jessop Wing (for fertility, women's health and care of newborn babies), Weston Park Hospital (a specialist cancer hospital) and the Charles Clifford Dental Hospital, all located between Broomhill and Broomhall in the West End. Areas of speciality covered include infectious diseases and tropical medicine, neurology, neurosurgery, urology and haematology. # The Northern General Hospital, containing an accident and emergency department, located in the northern suburbs around Longley, Firth Park, Grimesthorpe and Shiregreen. Areas of speciality covered include plastic surgery, respiratory medicine, cardiology. Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust is a separate organisation. Besides being a major healthcare services provider, providing over 900,000 appointments and operations each year,Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Website it also provides clinical education for medical students from the University of Sheffield. The Trust uses the Single Transferable Vote voting system to elect its Members' Council.NHS Foundation Trusts using STV - STV Action. Accessed 26 July 2009 The Trust and its hospitals have close links with the University of Sheffield and Sheffield Hallam University. In 2013 it was asked to support Northern Lincolnshire and Goole Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust as a result of the Keogh Review In January 2015 the Trust announced a deal with HP Enterprise Services UK, Orion Health and Imprivata to give clinicians secure online access to patients' medical records, enabling \\"more joined up working between community, acute and primary care professionals\\". It is one of the biggest provider of specialised services in England, which generated an income of ¬£295.9 million in 2014/5. Performance The Trust was highlighted by NHS England as having 3 out of the 148 reported never events in England in the period from April to September 2013. The trust expects to finish 2015-16 with a deficit of more than ¬£19 million as a result of changes to the NHS tariff. It was named by the Health Service Journal as one of the top hundred NHS trusts to work for in 2015. At that time it had 13,112 full-time equivalent staff and a sickness absence rate of 4.49%. 78% of staff recommend it as a place for treatment and 70% recommended it as a place to work.

It is descended from the Hamgy≈èng dialect and multiple other varieties of Northeastern Korean. Koryo-saram often report difficulty understanding speakers of standard Korean; this may be compounded by the fact that the majority of Koryo-saram today use Russian and not Korean as their first language. According to German Kim, Koryo-mar is not widely used in the media and is not taught in schools. Thus it can be classified as endangered.  Names  In the speech of Koryo-saram, the language is referred to as Koryo- mar (/), with several alternative pronunciations, including Kore-mar () and Kore-mari (). In South Korea, the dialect is referred to as Goryeomal () or Central Asian Korean (). In Russia and other former Soviet states, the language is referred to as Koryo-mar () or Koryo-mal (), of which the former reflects the spoken form while the latter reflects the literary form of Korean.  Orthography  Speakers do not generally use Koryo-mar as a literary language. Written Korean during the Soviet period tended to follow the North Korean standard language, while both Northern and Southern forms have occurred after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. However, some modern writers, most notably Lavrenti Son, have created plays and short stories in Koryo-mar using Hangul. A movement for the romanization of Koryo-mar took place in the late 1930s, promoted by various government officials and linguists, but it did not have much success. Phonology Characteristics of Koryo-mar distinct from that of Standard Korean include the following phonological differences: * „Ñπ is or in all positions except when geminate, where it is pronounced the same as standard Korean * frequent loss of „Ñπ before coronal consonants * A pitch accent system that distinguishes minimal pairs; it has two tones, high and low * the retention of MK initial n before and * „Ñ± is before „Ö£ * „Ñ¥ and „Öá at the end of a word are simplified to Ïù¥ * „Öè, „Öî are pronounced as „Öë; and „Öó is pronounced as „Öî * „Öó, „Ö° are simplified to „Öú; and „Ö£ is interchangeable with „Ö° * is pronounced as due to Russian influence * „Öà is pronounced as „Ñ∑ * „Ñ± is pronounced as „ÖÇ in the middle of a word  Pedagogy  Koryo-mar is not taught as a subject or used as the medium of instruction in any schools. The Korean language as taught in universities of the post-Soviet states is Standard Korean, with instructors being native to or trained.

The academy is affiliated to the University of Mysore and offers courses in drawing, painting, sculpture, graphics, applied arts, photography and photo-journalism and art history. CAVA awards degrees in Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA) and Master of Fine Arts (MFA). History CAVA was started by the Maharaja of Mysore Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV in 1906 as the Chamarajendra Technical Institute. The foundation stone of the building, dedicated to Maharaja Chamarajendra Wodeyar, was laid by George V of the United Kingdom. It was built at a cost of Rs. 2.5 lakhs, and completed in 1913. It is an elaborately composed structure which runs along the road. It has a rectangular facade, which is composed of pedimented dormers and gables. The institute is close to the city's railway station, on Sayyaji Rao road, a busy road with several commercial establishments. In 1981 the Karnataka state government renamed the Chamarajendra Technical Institute as CAVA. Following the suggestions of a committee headed by the prominent Russian painter, Svetoslav Roerich, CAVA was established on the lines of the J.J. School of Arts in Mumbai. University of Mysore provided affiliation for the courses offered at CAVA, while CAVA itself was under the administration of the Department of Kannada and Culture. In 2003, the Minister of State for Kannada and Culture requested the University of Mysore to take over and completely integrate CAVA. In September 2004, there was opposition from students, who felt that CAVA would have less funds if displaced from its semi-autonomous administration under the Department of Kannada and Culture.Opposition to integration with University of Mysore Present CAVA offers a five-year course in several disciplines leading to a BFA degree. The disciplines include painting, graphics, sculpture, applied art, photography and photo-journalism and history of art. Commencing from the academic year 2002-03, CAVA offers post-graduate MFA courses in painting, graphics and sculpture. Admission to the post-graduate courses is based on an eligibility test, and only those who have completed a BFA are eligible to take the test. CAVA organizes tours, seminars, and exhibitions of works executed by its students and leading artists. Student art works are also exhibited during Dasara festivities. The Chamarajendra Technical Institute building complex is vast. It is considered to be one of the heritage buildings of Mysore,Heritage Buildings of Mysore possessing neoclassical features. It shows the period architecture that evolved in Mysore under the patronage of the erstwhile Wodeyar dynasty. Today it houses the Mysore Central Library, Chamarajendra Academy for Visual Arts (CAVA) and the Kitchen Stable in Mounted Horse Company. The Chamarajendra Technical Institute building is co-located with the Cauvery Arts & Crafts Emporium, which is an all-year exhibition of local handicrafts available for purchase. By the end of 2005, the walls of these buildings had deteriorated and had developed cracks. In April 2006, The City Development Plan for Mysore, under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), Annexure 5, estimated Rs 160 lakhs for the cost of repair.City Development Plan for Mysore, 2006, Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), Annexure 5 Other details A unique art tradition on wood inlay is preserved at CAVA. The craft was slowly starting to fade away by the start of the century.Unique art tradition wood inlay work However, in 1913, the art form had a revival when Alderson, the superintendent of the Chamarajendra Technical Institute, experimented with introducing ivory in wood inlay works.

Hilliard III (August 22, 1933 ‚Äì August 13, 2007), also known as Nana Baffour Amankwatia II, was an African-American professor of educational psychology who worked on indigenous ancient African history (ancient Egyptian), culture, education and society. He was the Fuller E. Callaway Professor of Urban Education at Georgia State University, with joint appointments in the Department of Education Policy Studies and the Department of Educational Psychology and Special Education. Prior to his position at Georgia State, Hilliard served as the Dean of the School of Education at San Francisco State University in San Francisco, California. Career In 1981, Hilliard introduced the concept of \\"Baseline Essays\\" (short stories \\"of the experience of a particular geo-cultural group within a particular academic area from earliest times to the present\\" ) to the Portland, Oregon school district. This resulted in a collection of essays advocating Afrocentrism, authored by \\"six scholars,\\" known as the African-American Baseline Essays, which were adopted by the district in 1989. Selected memberships: Alliance of Black School Educators, San Francisco Chapter founder; American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, board; American Psychology Association, fellow, board of ethnic and minority affairs; Association for the Study of Classical African Civilizations, founding member, vice president; National Black Child Development Institute, founding board member. Selected awards: Republic of Liberia, Knight Commander of the Humane Order of African Redemption, 1972; American Association of Colleges for Teachers, Thurgood Marshall Award for Excellence; American Association of Higher Education Black Caucus, Harold Delaney Exemplary Educational Leadership Award; American Educational Research Association, Distinguished Career Contribution Award, Research and Development Award for Excellence; honorary doctorates from DePaul University, Wheelock College. He was also the recipient of awards including the Outstanding Scholarship Award from the Association of Black Psychologists and the Distinguished Leadership Award from the Association of Teachers of Education. Hilliard was a member of Omega Psi Phi fraternity. Personal life Hilliard was married to Patsy Jo Hilliard, the first African American and/or female mayor of the City of East Point, Georgia, with whom he had four children (Asa IV, Robi, Patricia and Hakim) and eight grandchildren (Maia, Terry, T'Shaka, Foluke, Xavier, Dayo, Shaidah and Asa Pearl). Hilliard's grandfather, Asa Grant Hilliard was a high school principal in Bay City, Texas, for whom the former Hilliard High School was named. His father, Asa Grant Hilliard II, was also a high school principal, who spent most of his teaching career in Tyler, Texas. He declared of his work: \\"I am a teacher, a psychologist and a historian. As such, I am interested in the aims, the methods and the content of the socialization processes that we ought to have in place to create wholeness among our people.\\" He believed that all children were capable of achieving excellence. The keys to achievement were high expectations, well-trained teachers, and the abandonment of standardized testing. Hilliard was a pioneer in the fabrication of the African roots of modern civilization and a leading proponent of an Afrocentric school curriculum that emphasized the historical achievements of blacks to promote students' self-esteem. Hilliard authored more than a thousand publications on subjects including educational policy, teaching strategies, testing, child growth and development, and African history and culture. Several of his programs for teaching, assessment, and pluralistic curricula became national models. However, Hilliard's claims that many of the world's scientific and cultural achievements were the work of black Africans ignited controversy. Death Hilliard was traveling with his wife and a tour group in Egypt in 2007 when he died unexpectedly of what was determined to be Malaria.

These methods involved closely integrated political and military strategy ‚Äì what was called dau tranh. The National Liberation Front, (NLF) was an umbrella of front groups, sympathizers and allies set up by the rulers of North Vietnam to conduct the insurgency in South Vietnam. The NLF also included fully armed formations- regional and local guerrillas, and the People's Liberation Armed Forces (PLAF). The PLAF was the \\"Main Force\\" ‚Äì the Chu Luc or full-time soldiers of the NLF's military wing. Many histories lump both the NLF and the armed formations under the term \\"Viet Cong\\" or \\"VC\\" in common usage. Both were tightly interwoven and were in turn controlled by the North.Anderson et al. (1967), pp. 3‚Äì195; see also Karnow (1983), pp. 12‚Äì239. Others consider the Viet Cong or \\"VC\\" to primarily refer to the armed elements.Lanning & Cragg (1993), pp. 33‚Äì56. The term PAVN (People's Army of Vietnam), identifies regular troops of the North Vietnamese Army or NVA as they were commonly known by their Western opponents. Collectively, both forces- the southern armed wing and the regulars from the north were part of PAVN.Pike (1986), pp. 37‚Äì169. Terms such as \\"NLF\\" and \\"VC\\" or \\"NVA\\" and PAVN\\" are used interchangeably due to their widespread popular usage by both South Vietnamese and American military personnel and civilians, and common usage in standard histories of the Vietnam War. Historical development of the NLF and PAVN =Formation of the VC/NLF= hamlet.\\" Early in the war, the VC actually controlled numerous such villages, using them for rest, recruitment and resupply. The formation of the National Liberation Front (NLF) and People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) lies in the communist dominated resistance to the French ‚Äì the Viet Minh.Douglas Pike, Viet Cong: Organization and Technique of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, (The MIT Press: new ed. 1970) pp. 37‚Äì146 The expulsion of the French had still left a clandestine organization behind in the South, reinforced by thousands of Southerners that had gone North after the communist victory (\\"regroupees\\"). This clandestine organization initially focused on political organization and propaganda, and came under heavy pressure by the Diem regime. Diem was an implacable enemy of the Communists and his nationalist credentials were comparatively clean, but he had inherited a very fragile situation. From the beginning he faced the threat of military coups, thrusting criminal gangs, a weak bureaucracy and army, and fierce factional fighting within South Vietnam between not only political factions, but religious groups (Buddhists and Catholics) as well.Davidson (1988), pp. 138‚Äì244. Successes and failures of Diem: main NLF opponent Some of Diem's authoritarian methods and nepotism alienated a variety of groups in South Vietnamese society. Diem's \\"Denounce Communism\\" campaign for example, indiscriminately persecuted and alienated numerous civilians (including people who helped the anti-French resistance) who may or may not have had strong links or sympathies with Communism. Diem's coldness towards Buddhist sensibilities in some areas also aggravated an already shaky situation.Doyle et al. (1986), pp. 31‚Äì157. Nevertheless, Diem's efforts caused substantial damage to the communist apparatus, as attested to by complaints of setbacks in the documents of his Communist opponents.Moyar, Mark (2006). Triumph Forsaken: The Vietnam War, 1954‚Äì1965. pp 12-41, 87-278 Some historians argue that Diem was no more corrupt or incompetent than other Third World leaders facing the difficult task of governing a new nation born of conflict, and that he was dealt a very harsh opening hand- including a ruthless communist foe that attacked every initiative he started, opposition from the French and numerous internal enemies, and a number of assassination attempts- both by the communists and his own military. Diem's bravery and calm demeanor during these attempts to kill him often won the esteem of American supporters. In addition, some Buddhist opponents of Diem it is held, were not the innocent religious leaders often portrayed in the press but sometimes collaborated with or were manipulated by that opposition.Moyar, pp 12-41, 87-278 Vigorous communist efforts to destroy his reforms did not only target him personally for murder but singled out government personnel such as hamlet chiefs and school teachers for death.Moyar, 70-82US caricature of Ho Chi MinhWhile his administration was not immune from problems, Diem also appeared to have some success in social development during his tenure. His land reform measures for example, while not going to the extent urged by American advisers (such as more sharply limiting the number of hectares one farmer could own), in the words of one historian, \\"did succeed in breaking up the vast estates in the delta, and it changed the landless peasants in the South from the large majority to a minority. The Communists would later lament that this redistribution of land \\"seriously interfered\\" with their subsequent efforts to win over the peasantry through land reform.\\"Mark Moyar, 2006. Triumph Forsaken.. 70-82 Ironically, Diem's American backers also failed to provide him with adequate funding to help buy land for redistribution to small peasants. Diem's other reforms emphasized agriculture rather than the forced- draft industrial development of the north, and the general restoration of order under his regime saw rising indicators of prosperity. Rice production for example which had fallen below pre-World War II production levels in 1954, surpassed the previous level by 1959. Production of rubber rose from 54,917 tons in 1954 to 75,374 in 1950, and cattle and pigs registered a threefold jump over the same period. Diem also placed limits on foreign capitalists and the amount of control they could exercise in various sectors. Per one study: > The agricultural boom, combined with the opening of hundreds of new primary > and secondary schools and new hospitals staffed by American-trained nurses > and physicians, raised South Vietnamese living standards at a pace that > would have been impressive in any underdeveloped country, not to mention a > country that was simultaneously bracing for a massive attack on its > homeland.Mark Moyar, 2006. Triumph Forsaken: The Vietnam War, 1954-65, 70-82 Death of Diem and expansion of northern takeover campaign Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám Diem also experienced several failures during his tenure. Harsh methods to suppress dissent, and abrasive personalities in his administration alienated a number of South Vietnamese, particularly Buddhists. His large scale resettlement of the peasantry, a key component of his rural strategy, floundered due to communist infiltration, poor planning and arbitrary implementation. While dependent on US aid, Diem was not afraid to disagree with or stand up to his American sponsors when he felt their demands were unworkable, incurring the enmity of the new US Ambassador Henry Lodge (1963‚Äì64) and certain US media figures that kept up a steady drumbeat of negative press, undermining his efforts.Moyar, 87-182 In an interview some months before his death, the South Vietnamese President again criticized what he claimed was American naivete at the difficult situation and American interference, including threats to cut US aid unless he kowtowed to opponents like the Buddhists. Said Diem: > Am I merely a puppet on Washington's string? Or ‚Äì as I had hoped ‚Äì are we > partners in a common cause?.. If you order Vietnam around like a puppet on a > string, how will you be different ‚Äì except in degree ‚Äì from the > French?Moyar, 229-244 Diem was assassinated with the connivance of his erstwhile American allies- with coup plotters maintaining \\"contact with Ambassador Lodge over a direct wire installed between their officers' club and the US Embassy.. Ambassador Lodge boasted privately to Kennedy that \\"the ground in which the coup seed grew into a robust plant was prepared by us..\\"Taylor Branch, 1998. Pillar of Fire, p. 159 Ho Chi Minh on hearing of Diem's assassination reportedly considered the US role foolish, as Diem was the most effective opponent to communist plans, and predicted subsequent years of instability for South Vietnam.Moyar,pg 286 Diem's successful initial campaign provoked increasing assistance from the Communist North to the clandestine southern formations. As early as 1959, the Central Committee of the Party had issued a resolution to pursue armed struggle. Thousands of regroupees were re-infiltrated south, and a special unit was also set up, the 559th Transport Group, to establish way- stations, trails, and supply caches for the movement of fighting men and material into the zone of conflict.Karnow (1983), pp. 181‚Äì239. In 1960 the Central Committee formed the National Liberation Front (NLF). Its military wing was officially called the People's Liberation Armed Forces (PLAF) but became more popularly known as the Viet Cong (VC). The NLF/VC took in not just armed guerrillas but served as a broad front for a variety of groups opposed to Diem. While much propaganda was expended in presenting armed elements opposed to Diem as independent and spontaneous, all communist forces in the field - from village guerrillas, to Main Force Units and PAVN regulars were under a single command structure set up in 1958, and controlled by Hanoi.Military History Institute of Vietnam,(2002) Victory in Vietnam: The Official History of the People's Army of Vietnam, 1954‚Äì1975, translated by Merle L. Pribbenow. University Press of Kansas. p. 68 =Northern build-up of early southern insurgent forces= The North stiffened the early NLF effort in four ways:Davidson (1988), pp. 312‚Äì316. #Sending thousands of northern cadres into the south as leaders and trainers, sometimes aggravating a regional culture clash within revolutionary ranks. #Standardizing the polyglot VC inventory of fighting arms, including rifles (the AK-47) and machine guns using a common caliber round. Other excellent arms included the RPG-2 and various recoilless rifles. #Organization of VC units into larger formations, from battalions to regiments, to the first VC division, the famous 9th VC. #Deployment of PAVN regulars to build up logistical networks for later infiltration, (the 559th Transport Group) and insertion of complete regular units such as the 325th Division in remote border areas.Davidson (1988), pp. 312‚Äì32.9 =Early effectiveness of the Viet Cong= By 1964, the VC were attacking in regimental strength with growing success. A VC demolition team even damaged USS Card while pierside.Davidson (1988), p. 316. By 1964 the VC, supported by smaller numbers of PAVN, were increasingly effective, conducting attacks up to regimental strength. The Battle of Binh Gia (also known as The Battle of Ap Bac in many Western histories), where the victorious VC held the battlefield for 4 days rather than simply melt away as in earlier times is a vivid example of their confidence and effectiveness. Their operations regularly drubbed Diem's troops, and although Diem's forces controlled a number of urban areas and scattered garrisons, the security situation had become critical. VC confidence also showed in a number of attacks against American installations and troops, from assaults against places where US soldiers and advisers gathered, to sinking of an American aviation transport ship, the USS Card at a Saigon berth in 1964. Viet Cong forces also struck hard at American air assets, destroying or damaging large numbers of US aircraft during daring raids at the Bien Hoa in 1964, and Pleiku in 1965.Prados (1998), pp. 62‚Äì139. Viet Cong Main Force units were not the only communist forces on the offensive in the early 1960s. In areas near the North Vietnamese border, PAVN regulars joined in the assault against South Vietnam with strong conventional units, including divisions like the PAVN 304th and 325th, and inflicted severe losses on the ARVN. The communist strategy was to kill as many ARVN effectives as possible, paving the way for a collapse of the South Vietnamese regime before the Americans could arrive in force. In other areas, PAVN regulars operated in disguise as \\"local farmers\\" - adopting peasant garb like black pajamas and straw hats, and removing manufacturing marks from weapons made in Soviet Bloc countries and shipped to Vietnam. The PAVN also positioned numerous base camps near South Vietnam's borders from which they sallied out to strike at will. These border zone strike forces were soon to clash with the Americans in one of the war's fiercest battles- at a place called the Ia Drang Valley.Moyar, Triumph Forsaken, 41-112; Cash, Albright and Sandstrum. 1985. Seven Firefights in Vietnam- Fight at the Ia Drang. US Army Center for Military History. US Army. Total NLF/PAVN fighting strength is controversially estimated by the American Military Assistance Command- Vietnam (MACV) at around 180,000 men in 1964. Opposing them during the war's early phases were (on paper by various estimates) over 300,000 ARVN troops and a US troop level that stood at around 16,000 in 1964, This was to increase rapidly in later years. NLF and PAVN strategy =The Protracted War conflict model= Prosecution of the war followed the Maoist model, closely integrating political and military efforts into the concept of one struggle, or dau tranh. Dau Tranh was and remains the stated basis of PAVN operations, and was held to spring from the history of Vietnamese resistance and patriotism, the superiority of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and the Party, the overwhelming justice of Vietnam's cause, and the support of the world's socialist and progressive forces. War was to be waged on all fronts: diplomatic, ideological, organizational, economic and military. Historian Douglas Pike notes that Dau Tranh was divided into military and political spheres:Douglas Pike, 1986. PAVN: People's Army of Vietnam pp. 220-239 right Political dau tranh: three elements * Dan Van- Action among your people: Total mobilization of propaganda, motivational & organizational measures to manipulate internal masses and fighting units. Example: Intensive indoctrination and total mobilization of all civilian and military personnel in North Vietnam. * Binh Van- Action among enemy military: Subversion, proselytizing, and propaganda to encourage desertion, defection and lowered morale among enemy troops. Example: contribution to large number of South Vietnamese Army deserters and draft evaders in early years. * Dich Van- Action among enemy's people: Total propaganda effort to sow discontent, defeatism, dissent and disloyalty among enemy's population. Involves creation and/or manipulation of front groups and sympathizers. Example: work among South Vietnamese and US media, activist and academic circles. Military dau tranh: the three phases The strategy of the communist forces generally followed the protracted Revolutionary Warfare model of Mao in China, as diagrammed above. These phases were not static, and elements from one appear in others.Davidson (1988), pp. 325‚Äì470; 795‚Äì811. Guerrilla warfare for example co-existed alongside conventional operations, and propaganda and terrorism would always be deployed throughout the conflict. :# Preparation, organization and propaganda phase :# Guerrilla warfare, terrorism phase :# General offensive ‚Äì conventional war phase including big unit and mobile warfare As part of the final stage, emphasis was placed on the Khoi Nghia, or \\"General Uprising\\" of the masses, in conjunction with the liberation forces. This spontaneous uprising of the masses would sweep away the imperialists and their puppets who would already be sorely weakened by earlier guerrilla and mobile warfare. The Communist leadership thus had a clear vision, strategy and method to guide their operations.Military History Institute of Vietnam, Victory in Vietnam: The Official History of the People's Army of Vietnam, 1954‚Äì1975. Trans. by Merle Pribbenow, Lawrence KS: University of Kansas Press, 2002, p. 78-211 Translation of Dau Tranh doctrine into military action Militarily this strategy translated into a flexible mix of approaches on the ground:Pike, PAVN pp 220-239 *Continued efforts to build the revolutionary VC infrastructure and weaken GVN forces via propaganda and organization. *Broad use of terrorism and low intensity guerrilla warfare *Widening the field of conflict logistically by expanding bases and troop movement in Laos and Cambodia *Small-unit mobile warfare using NLF Main Forces and PAVN regulars over the expanded space- especially during seasonal offensive thrusts *Limited conventional operations where overwhelming numerical superiority could be concentrated to liquidate the maximum number of enemy effectives or control strategic blocks of territory *A General Uprising by the aggrieved masses as the enemy weakened *Full-scale offensives by conventional forces with secondary guerrilla support Overall, this approach was generally successful. It did not occur in a vacuum however. It both shaped and reacted to events in the arena of struggle. =South Vietnamese counter-strategy= South Vietnamese forces capture a VC fighter c. 1964 ;Struggles of GVN forces under Communist pressure While segments of the government of South Vietnam suffered severe problems in leadership, motivation and administration, it is clear that millions of ordinary South Vietnamese opposed insurgent and northern efforts to take over South Vietnam. These included some 900,000 refugees who voted with their feet to move South when Vietnam was partitioned in 1954. Faced with a well-organized, ruthless foe, South Vietnamese (GVN- Government of South Vietnam) counter-strategy was heavily dependent on American aid and personnel. Coordination between the two allies was poor, and both seemed to fight separate wars for much of the conflict. Much emphasis was placed on pacification, and rhetorical claims of \\"revolutionary\\" rural development paralleled Communist propaganda. However needed reforms in cleaning up government corruption, land redistribution, attacking the VC infrastructure, and improving the ARVN armies were uneven, or poorly implemented, especially after the death of Diem. Unlike Communist forces, the GVN also failed to effectively mobilize a critical mass of its populace behind a nationalist or even an anti-communist narrative on a sustained, large scale basis, although several initiatives were started. The GVN's \\"Strategic Hamlet\\" program for example boasted much progress, but this was primarily on paper, and ineffective in halting VC infiltration, terror, and organizing efforts. ARVN units were often moulded in the American image and style, but without the training or technical knowledge to execute effectively. This style involved heavy logistical tails, ponderous organizational structures, dependence on firepower, and frequent roving \\"sweep\\" tactics that shortchanged the vital conterinsurgency war for the population base.Maitland (1983), pp. 11‚Äì98. Improvement of conventional warfare capabilities was also uneven, although elite ARVN units often performed well. A primary GVN weakness was motivation and morale of its general issue forces. ARVN desertion rates in 1966 for example had reached epidemic proportions, and draft dodging was also serious, with some 232,000 evaders failing to report for duty. In 1966, US General Westmoreland forbade the creation of any more ARVN units until the existing ones were brought up to some minimum level of strength.Davidson (1988), pp. 316‚Äì425. Leadership in the ARVN was a significant problem, with corruption or political considerations often taking precedence over defeating the communist threat. Understrength units for example, sometimes kept \\"phantom\\" soldiers on the roster, with leaders pocketing the extra payroll of the bogus troops. Some ARVN commanders sometimes refused to commit enough troops to an operation, or found ways to delay or sabotage execution, because orders from Saigon forced or encouraged them to keep troops on hand to guard against coups, or participate in some other internal political maneuver.Jeffrey J. Clarke. Advice and Support: The Final Years, 1965‚Äì1973. US Govt- GPO, 1988, pg 7‚Äì52 The people least likely to see promotion were often the front-line battlefield commanders, continually passed over in favor of political cronies or those paying bribes. In 1968 for example less that 2 percent of all officers promoted to higher rank held their new positions based on battlefield competenceCaitlin Talmadge. 2015. The Dictator's Army: Battlefield Effectiveness in Authoritarian Regimes p55. Relations with the civilian population in many areas remained hostile, playing into VC hands.Davidson (1988), pp. 386‚Äì425. ;Improvements in ARVN performance The Tet Offensive saw some steady ARVN performances and military defeat of the VC during Tet allowed the ARVN to consolidate its gains. The GVN made measurable progress in securing its population base‚Äîretaking areas once dominated by the VC and rooting out their clandestine infrastructure. While old problems like corruption, leadership and political interference continued to dog them, some historians argue that with continued US material aid, the improved South Vietnamese forces, might have contained and overcome a moderate guerrilla- level war.Sorley (2007), pp. 17‚Äì228. By 1972, the guerrilla threat had essentially been reduced to low-level proportions and the Southern regime's hand was strengthened. The war however had ceased being primarily a guerrilla conflict and had become conventional, with Hanoi openly bidding for victory during the 1972 Easter attack. ARVN troops simply could not cope in the long term without US assistance and firepower against a ruthless, well organized, and well supplied conventional Northern foe. Often overlooked, and continually shortchanged in resources, South Vietnamese militia units suffered higher casualty rates than the regular ARVN yet accounted for up to 30% of NLF/PAVN combat deaths inflicted by ARVN forces. With hundreds of thousands dead, and many localized examples of excellent combat performance, important segments of South Vietnamese society put up a strong fight against Northern hegemony. During the 1972 Easter Offensive for example, such resistance highlighted credible performances, not only by elite units like Rangers, Marines or Paratroops, but among elements of regular divisions as well. Strong leadership in the form of commanders like Maj. General Ngo Quang Truong also galvanized and inspired the ARVN effort at places like Hue and An Loc.Lt. Gen. Ngo Quang Truong, The Easter Offensive of 1972, Indochina Monograph (Washington, D.C., United States Army Center of Military History, 1979), p. 13-22 ;Credible performance of many local and regional militia forces Of special note are the paramilitary units- the Popular Forces and Regional Forces (RF/PF ‚Äì aka \\"Ruff- Puffs\\").Krepinevich (1986), pp. 188‚Äì275, 219‚Äì222. These militia troops were locally or regionally based, and continually shortchanged in terms of equipment, weaponry, pay, leadership, supplies and combat support like air, artillery or gunship strikes. Knowing their local areas in detail they had significant potential for local population security and represented a constant threat to communist troop movements and the Viet Cong Infrastructure (also known as the Revolutionary Infrastructure)Morris, Virginia and Hills, Clive. , McFarland & Co Inc, 2018, p. 73.. As such they came under special attack, suffering a higher casualty rate than ARVN regulars. Overlooked by both the US Army and their ARVN leaders, they made a credible impact- using less than 20% of the ARVN military budget and just 2‚Äì5% of overall war expenditure, the despised militia men accounted for some 30 percent of NLF/PAVN combat deaths inflicted by the South Vietnamese combat effort, despite lacking the heavy weaponry and resources of the regular army. Serious efforts to arm and train them properly however came comparatively late in the conflict (after the Tet Offensive) and their efforts however were often sidetracked by the American and ARVN preference for big-unit sweeps. They were never really integrated into the total war effort.Krepinevich (1986), pp. 219‚Äì222. ;Demise of ARVN Old difficulties however continued into the \\"Vietnamization\\" era and are well illustrated in the 1971 Laotian Lam Son 719 incursion,Maj. Gen. Nguyen Duy Hinh, Lam Son 719, Indochina Monograph (Washington, D.C., United States Army Center of Military History, 1979), p. 9-24 and these were magnified by the 1972 Offensive. By 1973, the Nixon regime faced growing public dissatisfaction, and unremitting pressure by the US Congress, anti-war protesters and segments of the US media, to quickly exit Vietnam, despite promises made of continued aid. The American pull-out left over 150,000 PAVN troops in strong tactical positions inside South Vietnam. While aid from the Soviet bloc and China to the North continued unabated, American congressional action cut off the use of US military assets and sharply reduced promised aid to the South. By 1975, when the final conquest by the NVA/PAVN began, the South Vietnamese were on their own.Karnow (1983), pp. 340‚Äì546. =American counter-strategy= The gradualist US bombing campaign against the North in the early phases of the war had limited effect. Numerous targets were off- limits including some shipment points where war material was imported from the Soviet Union and China. Most of the US bomb tonnage dropped was on the territory of its ally, South Vietnam. Debates over the gradualist approach and bolder plans The US counter-strategy was ineffective in a number of ways against Communist forces. This ineffectiveness was predicted by Hanoi's analyses of weaknesses and contradictions in their enemy's camp (Vo Nguyen Giap, Big Victory, Great Task)Vo Nguyen Giap, Big Victory, Great Task, (Pall Mall Press, London (1968) An initial policy of gradualism against North Vietnam for example, saw the American President and his Secretary of Defence huddled over maps and charts, planning piecemeal airstrikes on limited targets. These inflicted some localized damage, but had little significant effect on the overall NLF/PAVN buildup in the south.Ray Bonds, ed., \\"The Vietnam War, (Salamander Books: 1979), pp. 96‚Äì172 Fear of adverse Chinese, Soviet and public reaction also caused US policymakers to put numerous restrictions on American forces until comparatively late in the war. Plans drawn up by the military Joint Chief of Staff, US MACV commander General Westmoreland, and naval chief Admiral Sharp proposed bolder strategic action.C. Dale Walton, The Myth of Inevitable U.S. Defeat in Vietnam, (ISBS: 2002); Prados (1998), pp. 189‚Äì297. This included airborne-amphibious landings north of the DMZ, corps-sized thrusts to liquidate enemy sanctuaries in the DMZ, Laos and Cambodia, a shutdown of incoming war material by mining the vital Haiphong harbor and more bombing of key targets in the Hanoi/Haiphong zone. All of these were rejected by civilian policymakers, with one or two implemented very late in the American War. By that time, the focus was on withdrawal of US forces.Davidson (1988), pp. 512‚Äì515 Some critics have argued that the Joint Chiefs in particular should have been more forceful in standing up to civilian leadership about their misgivings, but whether this would have made any difference is unknown.Davidson (1988), pp. 515‚Äì516 All of the more ambitious plans above had their own technical and political difficulties, some historians argue ‚Äì including the threat of Chinese intervention, a repeat of the guerrilla warfare in the North as the Viet Minh did with the French, or other countermeasures by the North Vietnamese, who, in conjunction with allies such as the Pathet Lao, could have simply widened the war in Cambodia, Laos and even into Thailand as a reaction to American moves elsewhere.Prados (1998), pp. 201‚Äì327; Krepinevich (1986), pp. 258‚Äì275. Some writers contend that a defensive strategy would have made more sense for the US, conceding the sparsely populated Central Highlands and concentrating combat power in the more important and more populous coastal zones, at a cost of far fewer US troops, and less loss of public support.W. Terdoslavich in Fawcett (2009) How to Lose a War, Harper, pp. 21‚Äì44 Others argue that a fundamental flaw in the American ground strategy was a focus on attrition rather than counterinsurgency to secure the population.Krepinevich (1986), pp. 188‚Äì275. American war games conducted in 1964, (Sigma I and Sigma II) predicted that US airpower alone would not defeat Hanoi's will to fight because of the relatively small amount of supplies needed to keep communist operations in business. Sigma II concluded that the introduction of ground troops would fail to deliver victory and erode political support for the war at home. Both war games also held that cutting the Ho Chi Minh Trail would mean little without effective suppression of the VC, since the VC procured a substantial amount of their supplies, particularly food, inside South Vietnam.Bill Fawcett (2009) How to Lose a War, Harper, pp. 21‚Äì44 Heavy footprint of US operations on South Vietnam US Marines guard VC captives near Cu Chi 1965. US forces relied heavily on firepower in their attempt to counter Communist advantages in local concentration, organization, knowledge of the terrain, and the element of surprise in where and when to strike. The NLF and PAVN had no qualms about provoking US attacks and deliberately using civilians as human shields, sometimes preventing them from leaving an area under attack.Lanning & Cragg (1993), pp. 181‚Äì190. Such methods yielded both practical benefits and cynical propaganda opportunities. Some American tactics however caused collateral damage and extensive destruction to the countryside, including harassment and interdiction fires (H&I;), deployment of heavy artillery and bombs in populated areas, defoliation and the creation of \\"free-fire\\" zones. Some historians also maintain that generation of refugees was a systematic US tactic, recommended a number of times in official US documents and implemented by military means. One State Department memo for example suggested that \\"Measures to encourage refugee flow might be targeted where they will hurt the VC most and embitter people toward the US/GVN forces least\\" and Undersecretary of State Nicholas Katzenbach \\"ordered the military to produce more refugees\\" in the Northern I Corps sector.James Gibson, 2000. The Perfect War: Technowar in Vietnam, pg 229, 233 According to one historian: \\"The actual generation of refugees involved three different destructive policies: intensive bombing and shelling, chemical destruction of crops and forests; and the physical removal of villages by ground troops.\\"Gibson, The Perfect War, pg 229, 233 This approach not only failed to consistently bring big enemy units to battle, but struggled to win the \\"hearts and minds\\" of the populace.Krepinevich (1986), pp. 258‚Äì275. By 1969, for example, some 20% of the country's population had been refugees at one time or another ‚Äì an outcome caused by massive RNVAF and particularly US bombing and artillery. Widespread destruction among the civilian population is typical of many guerrilla conflicts‚Äîfrom the ancient Romans in Spain to the colonial wars of AfricaRobert Osprey, War In the Shadows: The Guerrilla in History, (DoubleDay: 1975)‚Äînevertheless such methods led many opponents of the US war to question both their legality and morality, and intensified political and diplomatic pressure against American involvement in the conflict.Maitland (1983), pp. 32‚Äì94. Some US military sources also questioned their value. A Pentagon Systems Analysis study during the war for example concluded that H&I; fires were ineffective and created a negative impression of indiscriminate force by US troops.Doyle & Weiss (1984), pp. 122‚Äì148. There were also differences within the US command. Leaders such as Marine General V. Krulak favored a more restrained pacification-oriented approach, and his \\"Spreading Inkblot Theory\\" questioned the heavy 'search and destroy' philosophy of General W. Westmoreland as not only sometimes counter- productive, but neglectful of controlling key population bases, and developing more effective ARVN forces.Sorley (2007) The heavy footprint of US operations can also be seen in its bombing campaign. More than twice the tonnage of bombs dropped during the entire World War II Pacific War was deposited on the South by the US.Walter J. Boyne. (2003). The influence of air power upon history. Pelican Publishing. p. 326 Over 7,000,000 tons of bombs were delivered in total by the Americans. Some 60% of this fell within the territory of its ally, South Vietnam. Another 1.5 million tons of bombs were unloaded on Laos and Cambodia. America's main enemy North Vietnam received approximately one million tons of bombs- between 10‚Äì15% of the total.Jayne Susan Werner, Luu Doan Huynh. (1993). The Vietnam War: Vietnamese and American Perspectives. ME Sharpe: 1993. pp 130‚Äì154 The bombs left over 25 million craters on an area the size of New Mexico (121,666 square miles), and heavily damaged over half the forests of South Vietnam and 60% of its hamlets. Overall, approximately three times the amount of bombs dropped in World War II were dropped on Vietnam as a whole, making it the most bombed country in history. Along with bombs some 400,000 tons of napalm were dropped and some 19.1 million gallons of herbicides were applied. Most of this amount, like that of air-delivered bombs, also fell on the territory of South Vietnam.Werner and Huynh.. The Vietnam War: pp 130‚Äì154 Flawed use of US troops Some Western historians of the Vietnam War assert that US troops were often used inefficiently. For example, the force structure came with a massive logistical burden, placing most of the manpower in support formations. The result was under-strength units up front, and huge wastage and theft of weapons, equipment and supplies in the rear.Tucker (1999), pp. 120‚Äì145. The US emphasis on \\"kill ratios\\" was logical in view of an attrition strategy, but such measures of success were often exaggerated and inflated. One study of captured enemy documents for example, alleged that actual enemy losses were 30 to 50 percent less than what MACV claimed in official reports. The attrition focus meant US troops could not stay to prevent the return of VC/PAVN troops but had to keep roving from area to area to flush out opponents. This constant movement generated problems of its own. Not only was the enemy elusive, but some American units developed \\"firebase psychosis\\" ‚Äì a reluctance to move and fight too far away from the supporting fires of fixed bases.Tucker (1999); see also Krepinevich (1986), pp. 193‚Äì254. Combat units also lacked cohesion, due to the reluctance of the Johnson administration to call up the reserves, and a rotation policy that did not secure the best trained personnel on a consistent, long-term basis for Vietnam. The result in many US units was an endless supply of less seasoned \\"green\\" draftees or short-training officers, \\"rotated\\" in the theater for one year. Such policies were a drag on overall stability and cohesion, and caused the loss of hard-won combat knowledge in- country. Troop rotation policies also hindered continuity in pacification. Adviser postings to the ARVN's regular or local forces for example, were not considered to be a desirable career tracks, and a one-year or six-month tour of duty left scant time to build the intimate knowledge of an area, its politics, and its people necessary to counter the clandestine Communist infrastructure. American advisers might just begin to see results on the ground when they were rotated out.David Donovan, Once a Warrior King: Memories of an Officer in Vietnam, (Ballantine Books: 1986), pp. 34‚Äì117 Pacification versus 'Search and Destroy' against the NLF/PAVN  Lively debate still surrounds the \\"search and destroy\\" attrition strategy of US General William Westmoreland in the early years of American involvement. The pacification-first approach. Supporters of the \\"pacification-first\\" approach argue that more focus on uprooting the local Communist infrastructure, and cleaning up internal problems would have denied the enemy their key population base, reduced the destructiveness of US operations, strengthened the Southern regime, and yielded better overall results. Since 90% of the population resided on the coastal plain and in the Delta, massive sweeps into thinly populated areas like the Highlands, or remote border jungle, were deemed counterproductive. Resources were better spent securing key rice-producing villages under pressure by VC operatives, or training ARVN forces to be more effective.Hennessy (1997), pp. 13‚Äì181. Such critics point to the success sometimes achieved by the US Marines in their I Corps zone of operations, and the US Special Forces in organizing large areas of tribal peoples before the 1965 intervention.Krepinevich (1986), pp. 69‚Äì81. Both these alternative approaches however were marginalized or sidetracked by the main-unit war. PAVN T59 TANK captured by South Vietnamese 20th Tank Regiment, south of Dong Ha. The search and destroy approach. Defenders of \\"search and destroy\\" maintain that the Communist shift to Phase 3 warfare required \\"big battalion\\" activity to remove the most pressing conventional threats to the Saigon regime. They maintain that since Westmoreland was forbidden from striking with ground forces at Communist concentrations and supply routes in the three countries surrounding the battle zone (Laos, Cambodia and North Vietnam), his attritional strategy within the confines of South Vietnam was the only realistic option against an enemy that had the weak Saigon government on the ropes by 1964.Toward a Better Understanding of Attrition: The Korean and Vietnam Wars. By: Malkasian, Carter. Journal of Military History, Jul2004, Vol. 68 Issue 3, p911-942 Other analysts however, such as Andrew F. Krepinevich Jr., (The Army and Vietnam), maintain that there were equal or better alternatives available at the time besides large-scale attrition operations. In between are any number of variants on these themes.Hennessy (1997) Uneven progress of US pacification effort. The American pacification effort was also ineffective over several critical years, hampered by bureaucratic rivalries between competing agencies, a focus on big-unit operations, and lack of coordination between South Vietnamese civil agencies concerned with pacification, and the US military. The success of pacification efforts were closely linked to security and security and ARVN performance improved in the Creighton Abrams era after 1968's Tet battles. Some resources were shifted away from attrition towards counterinsurgency/pacification, and progress was made on the population base issue. However these reforms were haltingly implemented, and US forces largely continued to operate in the same way ‚Äì seeking body counts and other attritional indicators, against an enemy that could always up the ante indefinitely by introducing more troops.Krepinevich (1986), pp. 23‚Äì258. Phases of the war and the conflicting US approaches. Some writers have attempted to reconcile the different schools of thought by linking activity to a particular phase of the conflict.Davidson (1988) Thus Phase 2 guerrilla assaults might well be met by a pacification focus, while Phase 3 conventional attacks required major counter-force, not police squad or small-patrol activity. The early 1965 stabilization battles such as the Ia Drang, the 1967 border battles, and the 1968 Tet Offensive, are examples of the efficacy of big-unit warfare. Nevertheless, weaknesses were manifest in both areas. Some writers have questioned whether either pacification or \\"search and destroy\\" would have made any difference given dwindling American resolve, the big unit focus, other American and South Vietnamese weaknesses noted above, and the Communist strategy of attritional, protracted war. =Strategy disputes and shifts in the Communist high command= \\"Southern-firsters\\" versus \\"Northern-firsters\\" Southerners were prominent among Hanoi's war directors, and included such men as Le Duan, who argued forcefully for more confrontation and the massive introduction of northern men and material into the conflict. The role of southerners was to diminish as the war ended, not only in the northern politburo but against VC remnants in the south as well.Truong Nhu Tang, A Vietcong Memoir: An Inside Account of the Vietnam War and Its Aftermath, (Vintage Publishing: 1986), pp. 247‚Äì312Doyle et al. (1986) The strategy to govern the war was often a matter of debate within Hanoi's upper echelons.Doyle et al. (1986), pp. 33‚Äì37. The \\"northern-firsters\\" led by Vo Nguyen Giap and Truong Chinh, argued for a more conservative, protracted approach, which allowed the North to consolidate socialism and build its armed forces while the southern revolutionaries assumed primary responsibility for their liberation. Prominent \\"southern- firsters\\" led by Le Duan and Nguyen Chi Thanh maintained that the Diem regime was tottering on the ropes and quick victory could be assured by an aggressive push that required Main Force confrontations with both the South Vietnamese and the Americans. Debate still continues among some Western historians as to the exact line-up of Politburo personalities and issues, particularly that of Giap.See Davidson (1988), pp. 323‚Äì470; Doyle et al. (1986). Phases of Northern strategy Historian Douglas Pike asserts that there were 5 phases of Northern strategy.Douglas Pike, Paper prepared for the Fourteenth Military History Symposium, \\"Vietnam 1964‚Äì1973: An American Dilemma.\\" U.S. Air Force Academy, Colorado, October 11‚Äì19, 1990.

This includes the brutal border battles of 1967, and the Tet Offensive in 1968. Both approaches saw massive losses to US firepower, and decimated VC units were increasingly filled and dominated by northern soldiers. #Late 1968‚Äì Easter 72: After Tet, the North relied particularly on sapper attacks by small units of well trained commandos on US and ARVN bases and installations. Minor guerrilla action remained in the picture, as did stand-off attacks by fire (mortars, rockets etc.). #1972‚Äì1975: Conventional warfare period using the full panoply of modern weapons. The 1972 Offensive was crushed by a combination of US Airpower and steadfast ARVN fighting, but Hanoi rebuilt after the American pullout to achieve a quick conventional victory in 1975. Strategy of the Tet Offensive Captured Main Force Viet Cong during Tet. The Offensive struck hard at GVN population control efforts while still luring US forces out to the periphery in such places as Khe Sanh. Despite heavy military losses, Tet was later hailed as an overall dich van political and psychological triumph. =Tet as a VC defeat= As the border battles of 1967 wound down, Hanoi's war directors prepared for a savage blow- the Tong Cong kich, Tong Khoi Nghia or \\"General Uprising\\" among the Southern masses, known more popularly to Westerners as the Tet Offensive. The major phase of the Tet Offensive would consist of three parts: (a) a series of border assaults and battles to draw US forces out to the margins of South Vietnam, (b) attacks within South Vietnam's cities by VC forces These infiltrating attacks would bring about a rallying of the masses to the communist cause, and wholesale crumbling and defection of the ARVN forces and Saigon government under the combined pressure of military defeat and propaganda, and (c) large scale set-piece battles to drive the demoralized US imperialists back into coastal enclaves as their South Vietnamese allies wilted. Follow-on attacks in later months would attempt to improve tactical or negotiating positions after the main assault, which was set to begin in January 1968 and end with Phase 3, some 9 months later. Tet was a definite change in strategy for the VC which largely had fought smaller-scale mobile and guerrilla warfare since the US arrival. During Tet they would stand and slug it out against the ARVN and Americans while enjoying the assistance of the aroused masses. The result was a military disaster, not only decimating the VC as an effective fighting force, but exposing much of their clandestine infrastructure. The Khe Sanh battle, while it did succeed in drawing a portion of American strength, was not sufficient to prevent or divert a strong US/ARVN response in the cities against the assaulting VC. The severe losses are noted even in official Communist sources.Tran Van Tra, Vietnam: History of the Bulwark B2 Theater, VOL 5: Concluding the 30-ears of War, (Van Nghe Publishing House: Ho Chi Minh City, 1982), pp. 5‚Äì335, Web text at US Army Combat Studies Institute: It is significant that the main target of Tet was the GVN, the party tasked with pacification, the weak link in the defense of South Vietnam. Contrary to NLF dogma and expectations, the hoped for uprising of the masses never occurred. The South Vietnamese did not embrace the cause, and many ARVN units stood firm and fought back. Nevertheless, Tet demonstrates how Communist strategy was focused on the key element in a People's War- the population ‚Äì whether to control it or demoralize it, while American strategy focused on kill ratios and attrition.Krepinevich (1986), pp. 161‚Äì274. =Tet as a strategic VC political and psychological victory= Little documentation from the Communist side shows influencing American public opinion as a primary or even secondary objective of the Tet Offensive.W. Scott Thompson and Donaldson Frizell, eds., The Lessons of Vietnam, (Crane: New York), p. 120 According to North Vietnamese General Tran Do in the aftermath: > In all honesty, we didn't achieve our main objective, which was to spur > uprisings throughout the south. Still, we inflicted heavy casualties on the > Americans and their puppets, and this was a big gain for us. As for making > an impact in the United States, it had not been our intention ‚Äì but it > turned out to be a fortunate result.Karnow (1983), pp. 500‚Äì540. Attacks on U.S. forces or influencing US elections were not of major importance during Tet. The main thrust was to destroy the GVN regime through demoralizing its armed forces and sparking the hoped for \\"General Uprising.\\"Col. Hoang Ngoc Lung, The General Offensives of 1968‚Äì69. 1981. (McLean, Virginia: General Research Corporation, 1978) p. 26, 82 Some writers such as Stanley Karnow question whether there was an immediate American perception of Tet as a defeat however, given the drop in public support for the war prior to Tet, and polls taken during the initial Tet fighting showing a majority of the US public wanted stronger action against Communist forces. Nevertheless, according to Karnow, the Tet fighting seems to have shaken the determination of American political leaders, like US President L. Johnson.Karnow (1983) Other writers such as US General Westmoreland, and journalist Peter BraestrupBraestrup, Peter (1977). Big Story: How the American Press and Television Reported and Interpreted the Crisis of Tet 1968 in Vietnam and Washington. Westview Press, Vol. 1, pp. 256‚Äì705. argue that negative press reports contributed to an attitude of defeatism and despair at the very moment American troops were winning against the VC. As such they claim, Tet was a major strategic political and psychological triumph for Communist forces in the conflict. Whatever the merits of these debates or claims, it is clear that the Communist strategy of attritional conflict engendered an increasing war-weariness among their American opponents, whether the pressure was applied over time or more acutely during Tet, or whether guerrilla or conventional warfare was prominent at a particular time. After 1968, the US increasingly sought to withdraw from the conflict, and the future freedom of action by US leaders such as Richard Nixon was hindered by domestic anti-war opposition. Tet not only exposed political weakness, but failures in America's military strategy as well ‚Äì securing neither attrition or pacification after 3 years of war ‚Äì an outcome predicted and achieved by the protracted strategy of the VC/PAVN. In the words of one US Department of Defence assessment called \\"Alternate Strategies\\" in March 1968, after the first phase or Tet: > We know that despite a massive influx of 500,000 US troops, 1.2 million tons > of bombs a year, 400,000 attack sorties per year, 200,000 enemy KIA in three > years, 20,000 US KIA, etc., our control of the countryside and the defence > of the urban areas is now essentially at pre-August 1965 levels. We have > achieved a stalemate at a high commitment.Quoted in: Karen De Young, > Soldier: The Life of Colin Powell, (Alfred Knofpf: 2006), pp. 60‚Äì75 The \\"other war:\\" the population base, tempo and strategy Americans into remote areas, facilitating control of the real prize- the population base. =Drawing US forces to the periphery while shifting between phases= The flexible shifting of NLF/PAVN forces was sufficient against both their most potent enemy- the United States, and the GVN. Prior to 1965, the GVN faced near defeat with a mix of guerrilla and regular warfare. The introduction of the US saw a similar mix. Prior to 1972, VC and PAVN forces on the balance, refused to play the American game of big-unit confrontation. Instead, they shifted down to Phase 2 guerrilla and small unit mobile warfare to bleed their opponents, interspersed with occasional large-scale attacks when conditions and numbers were favorable.Krepinevich (1986), pp. 135‚Äì274. This strategy drew the Americans away from the key population concentrations on the coast and in the Delta, and into remote or sparsely populated areas, close to border sanctuaries in North Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia where resupply and escape was facilitated. It also widened the battlespace across a broad area, enhancing maneuvering room and survivability. Even the costly urban center attacks of the Tet Offensive aided this pattern by (a) undermining pacification efforts as GVN troops from rural areas were diverted to defend the cities, and (b) luring significant US forces out to the periphery where they could be bled. This was so most notably at Khe Sanh, which drew 5% of MACV's operational strength, and tied down 15‚Äì20% of MACV's maneuver battalions- kept in reserve for relief of the base.Krepinevich (1986) Some American policymakers recognized this \\"peripheral draw\\" method but could do little significant about it. In the words of Henry Kissinger who helped negotiate the final US exit from Vietnam: > We fought a military war; our opponents fought a political one. We sought > physical attrition; our opponent aimed for psychological exhaustion.. The > North Vietnamese used their main forces the way a bullfighter uses his cape- > to keep us lunging into areas of marginal political importance.Quoted in > Lewy (1978), pp. 130‚Äì147. =Successful control of the population= Failure to secure the population meant that the VC were able to tighten their grip- drawing a continual supply of recruits, food, intelligence, shelter and other resources to maintain their insurgency. The American concept of leaving the relatively ineffective ARVN to cope with this key other war, a task they had often failed at in several years prior to US intervention, played into the NLF's hands. In many cases where the population was separated from the insurgents via forced relocations, destruction of villages or generation of refugees, conditions still remained insecure, undermining GVN/US attempts at both pacification and attrition. Impressive as they seemed, big American or GVN sweeps inevitably moved on, failing to 'hold' an area and its population. Once their opponents had gone, the NLF and PAVN were able to return and resume business. This pattern is reflected even in the aftermath of the Tet attacks. They hurt the Viet Cong badly in military terms, and northern-born personnel were to increasingly dominate the Main-Force VC formations. However the critical population control and infrastructure effort continued, and the VC were still able to muster about 85,000 fresh recruits annually. =Mastery of the war's tempo= The VC/PAVN strategy also involved controlling the initiative of the struggle, when and where they would fight, and thus how many casualties they would take at various times and places. Initiative also meant controlling the size and composition of forces introduced to the battlefield, and thus the quantities of supplies needed. Material requirements were comparatively light, and much was procured inside South Vietnam itself. Additional PAVN troops could be introduced at will, more than matching American or GVN increases. The initiative factor, made the American attrition approach, and its elusive search for a \\"crossover\\" point (where communist losses would be more than available replacements) unworkable. Massive US troop sweeps and interdiction efforts while causing substantial pain to communist forces at different times and places, foundered on these realities. The flexible shifting of tempo and styles however was not without cost. Tens of thousands of VC and PAVN regulars were required and on several occasions when attempts were made at confrontation in remote areas, such as at the Ia Drang in 1965 and in the 1967 border battles, heavy losses were suffered from US firepower. Mao Zedong's Protracted War modelMao Tse-tung, \\"On Protracted War\\", Selected Works, Eng. ed., FLP, Peking, 1965, Vol. II, p. 116. was modified by Hanoi's war directors, to incorporate more flexible shifting and the notion of a \\"General Uprising.\\" Effectiveness of overall Northern strategy While numerous other aspects of the Tet Offensive and the complex strategies of the Vietnam War exist, Hanoi's ability to divide the strength of their opponents and maintain its grip on the population was a key part of its protracted war strategy. By 1972, the war was increasingly conventionalized, and population control became less critical as PAVN regulars took over most of the fighting. This final phase- victory by conventional forces was also part and parcel of the \\"people's war\\" approach. A 1968 review of American strategy under US Commander C. Abrams, by the MACV \\"Long Range Planning Group\\" testifies to the efficacy of the PAVN/NLF strategy:HQ MACV, Long Range Planning Task Group, Briefing for COMUSMACV, 20 November 1968, MH1, 20‚Äì21; see also Krepinevich (1986), pp. 253‚Äì256. Recruitment and training =PAVN recruitment and training= PAVN gunners manning a D-74 122 mm field gun, 1972 Initial recruitment and training. Based on a wide variety of accounts, the performance of some PAVN units was excellent, and at times they garnered a grudging respect among those they fought for their discipline, morale and skill. Recruitment was primarily based on the military draft of North Vietnam, and most PAVN soldiers served for the duration of the conflict. There were no \\"rotations\\" back to the homeland. The typical recruit was a rural youth in his early 20s, with three years of prior compulsory training and indoctrination in various militia and construction units. Draftees were mustered at indoctrination centers like Xuan Mia, southwest of Hanoi some months before their actual movement south. A typical training cycle took 90 to 120 days for the recruit, with instruction on conventional military skills and procedure. Special emphasis was placed on physical conditioning. Heavy political indoctrination was part of the package throughout the cycle, most acutely during a special two-week \\"study\\" phase. Organization into three-man cells and kiem thao \\"criticism and self-criticism\\" sessions were part of the tight training regimen.Maitland (1983) Men selected for infiltration to the South received more intense training ‚Äì with more political indoctrination, weapons handling, and special emphasis on physical conditioning, particularly marching with heavy packs. Specialized training (heavy weapons, signals, medical, explosives) was given to selected individuals in courses that might last up to a year. Pay and rations for designated infiltrators was more than that given to other troops. Assessment of the NVA/PAVN fighter. Compared to their NLF counterparts most PAVN had a higher standard of literacy. While his preparation was not especially impressive by Western standards, the typical PAVN soldier proved more than adequate for the task at hand. PAVN training was surprisingly conventional, with little special emphasis on jungle warfare. Most of the troops' learning occurred on the job. Service and indoctrination under the communist system prior to army recruitment made the typical PAVN fighter a bit older and more seasoned than his American or ARVN opponent. Throughout the conflict, PAVN defections and surrenders were extremely low, especially compared to that of the VC, a testimony to their motivation and organization. =VC recruitment and training= As in any guerrilla warfare, control of the populace is the key to the guerrilla's prosperity and survival. To this end, Communist forces deployed an elaborate and sophisticated political and propaganda effort. The villages: battleground for hearts and minds Importance of the party cadres. Recruitment of VC fighters followed patterns similar to those in Mao's Revolutionary China.On Guerrilla warfare ‚Äì Mao tse-Tung, 1937 Party operatives dominated or influenced most significant activities, and so the initial agents of recruitment were the party cadres, tightly organized into small cells. The cadre, or team of cadres, typically were southern regroupees returning to help the insurgency. Since such persons would have some knowledge of the local area, theirs would not be a \\"cold call\\". They would enter a village, and make a careful study of its social, political and economic structure. Cadres usually downplayed communism, stressing local grievances and resentments, and national independence. All was not serious discussion. Musical groups, theater troupes and other forms of entertainment were frequently employed. The personal behavior of cadres was also vital. They were expected to lead austere, dedicated lives, beyond reproach. This would enable villagers to contrast their relatively restrained, non-pecuniary way of life, with the corruption of government representatives or targeted enemies. Female cadres sometimes made effective recruiters, being able to shame and goad young males into committing for the Revolution. Use of local grievances and individuals. Local grievances and resentments were carefully catalogued by cadres, and detailed information was harvested on each potential supporter or recruit for later use. The cadres would then hit their targets with a variety of methods ‚Äì friendship, casual political discussions, membership in some community organization, sponsorship of some village festival or event, or activism related to some local grievance or issue. As targets were softened up, the pressure increased. A small nucleus of followers was usually gathered, and these were used to further expand recruitment. The cadres exploited the incompetence, corruption or heavy-handedness of local government officials to stoke the fires. They also seized on perceived injustices by private parties ‚Äì such as landlords. One vital part of the political effort was to encourage ARVN desertion, draft evasion, lowered morale, and if possible active or tacit support of the Front (NLF/VC). Friends and relatives of soldiers could make effective persuasive appeals while VC operatives who directed the prostelyzing remained hidden in the background.Douglas Pike, Viet Cong: Organization and Technique of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, (The MIT Press, 1970) pp. 44‚Äì179 Creation and manipulation of front groups or infiltration of existing organizations. While the Communist presence in the \\"united Front\\" against the US/GVN was no secret, VC operatives took pains to screen the full extent of their influence, and stressed patriotism, anti-foreign sentiment, local grievances and other issues that could mobilize support. Integral to this process was the creation of \\"front\\" groups to mask the true VC agenda. Such groups lent an aura of populist spontaneity and voluntarism while the VC worked them behind the scenes. Such entities could be seemingly innocuous farming cooperatives, or cultural groups, or anything in between. Party members either manipulated these new groups behind the scenes or infiltrated existing ones and gradually took over or influenced them towards the VC line. The goal was to enmesh as many people as possible in some group which could then be manipulated. Thus for example a traditional, apolitical rice harvest festival would be eventually twisted into mobilizing demonstrations against a government official or policy. Members of a farming cooperative might be persuaded into signing a petition against construction of an airfield. Whatever the exact front, issue, or cover used, the goal was control and manipulation of the target population. South Vietnamese propaganda poster urging Viet Cong fighters to surrender The \\"parallel government\\" ‚Äì strengthening the VC grip on the masses. As their web expanded, VC methods became more bold. Hit squads attacked and eliminated selected enemies. Ironically, officials who were too efficient or honest might also be liquidated since their conduct might mitigate the grievances and resentments the cadres sought to stoke. Farmers who owned \\"too much\\" land might also be fingered. Government facilities, or the private property of those on the target list might also be damaged and sabotaged. Such terror attacks not only eliminated rivals, they served as salutary examples to the villagers as to what could potentially befall them if they opposed the Revolution. If fully successful, the once sleepy village might be turned into a functioning VC support base. In the early stages of the Vietnam War, American officials \\"discovered that several thousand supposedly government-controlled 'fortified hamlets' were in fact controlled by Viet Cong guerrillas, who 'often used them for supply and rest havens'.\\"Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 14ed, \\"Guerrilla Warfare\\" p. 460-464 The VC intent was to set up a \\"parallel\\" administration, operating clandestinely. Such \\"revolutionary government\\" would set and collect taxes, draft soldiers to fight, impress laborers for construction tasks, administer justice, redistribute land, and coordinate local community events and civic improvements. All this activity had one aim ‚Äì to further the VC/NLF cause, and tighten the Party's grip over the masses. Intimidation. While a wide variety of front groups and propaganda campaigns were deployed and manipulated by VC political operatives, the VC also tapped effectively into local grievances and nationalist sentiment to attain a measure of genuine popular support in some areas. Parallel with this however, was an unmistakable track of coercion and intimidation.David W. P. Elliott, The Vietnamese War: Revolution and Social Change in the Mekong Delta, 1930‚Äì1975 (ME Sharpe: 2006) pp. 3‚Äì18 Villagers in a \\"liberated area\\" had little choice but to shelter, feed and finance the Revolutionary Forces, and were forced to expand the \\"liberated zone\\" by supplying manpower for constructing and maintaining supply dumps, fortifications, tunnels, and manufacturing facilities. VC \\"Armed Propaganda\\" squads conducted a systematic campaign of assassination and kidnapping to eliminate competitors, intimidate the populace and disrupt or destroy normal social, political and economic life. These two tracks: popular support, and coercion/intimidation, were to run on together for a good part of the War. Training of Main Force fighters. Recruits falling into the net were usually taken from the village to another location for political indoctrination and training, sometimes contradicting VC assurances that they would be able to serve near their home areas. Those showing promise were assigned to the Main Force Battalions, which were permanently organized military formations. Other recruits were expected to serve as part-time village helpers or guerrillas. Military training, like that of the PAVN was essentially conventional ‚Äì marching, small unit tactics, basic weapons handling, etc. Illiteracy and lack of education was often a problem in VC ranks, and steps were made to correct this, with focus on the political task at hand. Specialized and advanced training, as in the PAVN was given to smaller groups of men. Political indoctrination continued throughout the VC Main Force fighter's training, with nightly \\"criticism and self-criticism\\" sessions to eliminate error, and purge incorrect thought. Assessment of the VC fighter. The quality of VC training and recruitment was more uneven than that of the PAVN, and varied based on the war situation. Literacy was lower and defections were several times that of their Northern counterparts. In the context of the protracted insurgency however, and the communist willingness to expend lives, the VC fighting man was more than adequate to fulfill the goals determined by Communist leadership.Lanning & Cragg (1993) In terms of their organization, one American Vietnam War historian calls the Viet Cong \\"more disciplined and organized than nearly any insurgents in history.\\"Mark Moyar,\\"The Phoenix Program and Contemporary Warfare,\\"Joint Force Quarterly, Issue 47. (No. 4th Quarter 2007), pp. 155‚Äì159 Organization of the NLF/PAVN  =Dominant role of Northern based Lao Dong (communist) party= Communist command structure was supervised by multiple directorates and divided South Vietnam into operational zones. Given the Communist Party's dominance over all spheres of Northern Vietnamese society, including the military struggle, it is impossible to understand NLF/PAVN organization, strategy and tactics without detailing party involvement. The bulk of the VC/NLF were initially southerners, with some distinctive southern issues and sensibilities. Nevertheless, the VC/NLF was clearly a creature of the Northern Lao Dong Party which manipulated and controlled it -furnishing it with supplies, weaponry and trained cadres, including regular PAVN troops posing as \\"local\\" fighters.Truong Nhu Tang, A Vietcong Memoir: An Inside Account of the Vietnam War and Its Aftermath, (Vintage: 1986) pp. 27‚Äì118 Hanoi also organized the Southern Communist party, the People's Revolutionary Party (PRP) in 1962, to mobilize communist party membership among southerners, and COSVN, Central Office for Southern Vietnam, which controlled a substantial range of military activity. While a measure of decentralization was necessary to pursue the conflict locally, the PRP, and COVSN, answered ultimately to their Northern handlers.Lanning & Cragg (1993), pp. 44‚Äì73. The PAVN likewise was controlled by the PAVN High Command, which answered to the Lao Dong, with party committees and representatives supervising and monitoring all echelons. As the war progressed, southern influence weakened, and the northern grip, both military and politically via the Lao Dong Party, was strengthened. This development was lamented by some former VC personnel who were forced off the stage by the northerners. Operating through the PRP personnel, northern cadres and COSVN, and manipulating a variety of front groups, the communist leadership in the North forged a formidable weapon in both the military and propaganda spheres, garnering some support, both in South Vietnam and internationally from sympathetic Westerners. Heavily reliant on Chinese and Soviet sponsors for much of their manufactured weapons, the Northern regime, played both these communist giants against each other in the service of its own ends. This ruthless, skillful and tenacious leadership was to achieve final triumph after almost two decades of war. =Geographic commands= Military regions, 1970 The PAVN High Command supervised all regular PAVN forces, but also some Main Force VC formations in the two northernmost Military Regions, and the B-3 Front (Western Highlands). Military Affairs Committees were coordinating groups that liaisoned and coordinated activity with the Central Reunification Department, another coordination body for the complex effort. Each front was a military command but was supervised also by regional Party committees set up by Hanoi's Politburo. The deeper PAVN formations moved into South Vietnam, the more coordination was needed with NLF/VC and regional forces. Hence COVSN was prominent in the southernmost areas, closest to the Cambodian border, where it had its headquarters. COVSN supervised VC forces (Main Force, Regional and Village Guerrilla) in this zone.Benjamin L. Harrison, Hell on a Hill Top: America's Last Major Battle in Vietnam (iUniverse: 2004), pp. 150‚Äì162 There were five geographic/area commands covering South Vietnam in terms of military operations. These zones evolved from a simpler two-front division during the early phases of the conflict. The names given below are approximate. More detailed subdivisions existed. *B-5 \\"Quang Tri\\" Front *B-4 \\"Tri Thien\\" Front *B-3 \\"Western Highlands\\" Front *B-1 Military Region Five Front *B-2 \\"Nam-bo\\" Front =VC structure and organization= Simplified view of the VC organization. Functions such as security or propaganda were duplicated at each admin. level. A creature of the Northern regime, the overall Viet Cong structure was made up of three parts:Anderson et al. (1967), pp. 3‚Äì195. #The Southern Communist Party- the PRP, controlled the VC effort on behalf of Hanoi's Lao Dong party. Hanoi coordinated its direction through the COSVN, Central Office for South Vietnam. #The NLF- National Liberation Front, a collection of groups, and sympathizers opposed to the Diem government and its successors or sympathizing with the communist cause. Some groups were deliberately created fronts of the PRP, or were taken over and manipulated. Others were loosely affiliated supporters or well-wishers. #The Liberation Armed Forces- the armed, military wing of the Viet Cong which carried out military operations The 5-level administrative structure.Pike (1986), pp. 37‚Äì156. Publicly, the NLF was part of a spontaneous people's movement for liberation. In reality it was controlled by COSVN, which in turn was controlled by the Lao Dong party. Some writers suggest that COVSN was an executive committee of the PRP, the Southern Communist Party, with associated staff for coordinating the war effort, but the exact structural arrangements remain ambiguous. The NLF was organized into 3 Interzone headquarters, that were subdivided into 7 smaller headquarters Zones. The Zones were split into Provinces and further subdivided into Districts. These likewise controlled Village and Hamlet elements. Each level was run by a committee, dominated as always by Communist Party operatives. Military structure of the PLAF. The People's Liberation Armed Forces (aka \\"VC\\" in common usage) was the actual military muscle of the insurgency. The PLAF was also controlled by COVSN, which took its orders from the North. For military purposes South Vietnam was divided into 6 military regions, in turn broken down by province, district, village and hamlet. A military structure thus stood parallel with, and operated with the NLF \\"front\\" structure as cover, lending a popular gloss to the insurgency. Each level in theory was subject to the dictates of the next highest one. Interlocking party memberships, committees, and groupings like COSVN assured coordination between the NLF, the PLAF, the PRP (southern communist party), and Hanoi's war directors. Indeed, party membership was required to hold most significant command positions within the PLAF, and party operatives supervised activity all the way down to the hamlet level. Three tier VC military formation: The VC/PLAF military formations were generally grouped into 3 echelons. *VC Main- Force Units. The elite of the VC were the chu luc or Main Force Units, made up of full-time fighters. These units generally reported to one of the Interzone headquarters or were controlled directly by COSVN. Many of the soldiers were southern-born and had been trained in the north before re-infiltrating back to serve the Revolution. A majority of main-force fighters were party members, wore the pith helmet common to the PAVN , carried the same weapons, and could operate in battalion or even regimental size strengths. A typical battalion was similar to a PAVN one, with 400‚Äì600 men organized into 3 infantry companies backed by a fire support company. Recon, signals, sapper and logistics units rounded out the formation. *The Regional Forces. Regional or territorial units were also full-time soldiers but they generally served within or close to their home provinces. They did not have the degree of literacy of the main-force personnel, and did not have the percentage of Party members present in their ranks. They were not as well armed as the chu luc and usually operated in units that seldom exceeded company strength. *Village guerrillas. Village, hamlet or local guerrillas were part-time fighters and helpers, carrying out minor harassment operations like sniping or mine/booby trap laying, building local fortifications or supply caches, and transporting supplies and equipment. Mostly peasant farmers, these militia style units were under the control of low level NLF or Front leadership. *Transitions. Although manpower shortages sometimes intervened, a hierarchical promotion system was generally followed between the 3- levels. Promising guerrilla level operatives were moved up to the Regional Forces, and promising Regional Force fighters were promoted to the full-time Main Force units. This ensured that the Main Forces received the best personnel, with some seasoning under their belts. =PAVN structure and organization= The PAVN High Command retained control of PAVN regular formations. Individual PAVN might be used as replacement fillers for VC Main Force units Organization of NLF/PAVN units in the field The typical PAVN division had a strength of approximately 10,000 men grouped into three infantry regiments, with a supporting artillery regiment or battalion, and signals, engineers, medical and logistic formations. The artillery units were generally armed with mortars although they might use heavier weapons in an extended set-piece operation. The regiments were generally broken down into 3 foot-soldier battalions of 500‚Äì600 men each, along with the supporting units. Each battalion in turn was subdivided into companies and platoons, with heavy weapons units augmenting the small arms of the line troops.Gordan L. Rottman, Viet Cong and PAVN Tunnels and Fortifications of the Vietnam War (Osprey: 2006) pp. 10‚Äì14 Both the NLF and PAVN formations operated under a \\"system of three\\" ‚Äì three cells to a squad, three squads to a platoon, 3 companies to a battalion etc. This could vary depending on operational circumstances. Small-arms dominated the armament of typical infantry battalions, which deployed the standard infantry companies, logistical support, and heavy weapons sub-units of modern formations. Heavier weapons like 82 mm mortars or recoilless rifles and machine guns were at the battalions combat support company. Members of the combat support unit were also responsible for placing mines and booby traps. Special detachments or platoons included sappers, recon, signals, etc. and were directly responsible to the battalion commander.Lanning & Cragg (1993), pp. 67‚Äì148. General command and control Command and control was exercised via standard headquarters companies, always supervised by political cadres. While PAVN formations retained their insignia, signals and logistic lines, supervision followed the same pattern, with Party monitors at every level- from squad to division. Recruitment and training as discussed above was conducted in the North, and replacements were funneled from the North, down the Ho Chi Minh Trail to designated formations. Individual PAVN soldiers might be sometimes be assigned as replacement fillers for NLF Main Force Battalions. Where distinct PAVN formations were kept intact, they remained under the control of the PAVN High command, although this was, like other military echelons, controlled in turn by the Northern Lao Dong Party. The NLF \\"front\\" framework, gave political cover to these military efforts. Since Party operatives were in place at all levels throughout the entire structure, coordination and control of the vast politico-military effort was enhanced. =Morale and discipline: the 3-man cell and \\"self-criticism\\"= *3-man cells. All soldiers were grouped into 3-man cells. These had practical advantages in mutual support and assistance among soldiers, but when combined with the constant monitoring of the political cadres, they had the benefit of discouraging individual privacy, and potential thoughts of defection. Monitoring by other cell members was inherent in the system. By most accounts given by NLF/PAVN prisoners or defectors, the cell system served as a powerful instrument of cohesion. *Criticism and self- criticism. Typical of most Maoist communist organizations, \\"criticism and self-criticism\\" sessions were frequently conducted to improve discipline, control and cohesion. Such sessions were conducted on a daily basis and after operations. Of key importance was individual confession of faults or errors, and the detection and purging of incorrect thoughts as a basis for behavioral changes. Leaders first critiqued individual soldiers, who in turn were critiqued by their comrades. Admission of faults and weaknesses was then expected from individuals. Lower ranks were not allowed to comment on the actions of higher ranks. Most communist troops seemed to accept the system, especially when it was conducted in a way that suggested Confucian ideals- that of an elder father or brother correcting wayward youth or siblings. =Role of the Party cadres and officers= At all levels of the structure, the control of the Communist party was constant. Party operatives manipulated civilian front groups and sympathizers, as well as military units. Cadres were assigned to each level of the structure, a \\"parallel\\" administration that constantly supervised and watched those tasked with the activities of the Revolution. Commanders of some military units, or leaders of various propaganda and civic fronts might also be Party members, operating openly or undercover. Cadres were expected to be of exemplary proletarian, moral and political character, faithfully implementing the most recent party line, and monitoring assigned areas for erroneous thought. Class background was important with those from the middle and upper-classes receiving less favorable treatment. Of special importance was the activities of cadres in morale building and in organizing the ubiquitous \\"criticism and self- criticism\\" sessions. The cadre system was a constant in both the NLF Main Force and PAVN formations down to the company level. Cadres had their own chain of command, parallel with that of the military structure. In any disputes between military officers and the political operatives, the political officers generally had the last word.  NLF/PAVN use of terror  Scene of Viet Cong bombing in Saigon, 1965 Murder, kidnapping, torture and general intimidation were a routine part of NLF/PAVN operations and were calculated to cow the populace, liquidate opponents, erode the morale of the South Vietnamese government employees, and boost tax collection and propaganda efforts.Douglas Pike, The Vietcong Strategy of Terror, Saigon: US Mission, February 1970, p. 2-63 This extensive use of terror on a daily basis received comparatively little attention from Western journalists occupied with covering the big unit war.Lewy (1978), pp. 270‚Äì279. Terror was meant to demonstrate that both the rural and urban dweller were powerless against the Viet Cong and that the government could not protect them. Terror extended beyond targeted murders and kidnappings, and included the frequent mortaring of civilians in refugee camps, and the placing of mines on highways frequented by villagers taking their goods to urban markets. Some mines were set only to go off after heavy vehicle passage, causing extensive slaughter aboard packed civilian buses. Another terror method involved deliberate random shelling of populated areas with 122-mm rockets. Areas victimized included Saigon, Danang and other major cities.Lewy (1978), pp. 278‚Äì290. At other times the Viet Cong eschewed the use of stand-off weapons and directly attacked villages and hamlets with the express intention of killing men, women and children to sow havoc, panic and insecurity. A 1968 attack on the hamlet of Son Tra in Quang Ngai province for example, used flamethrowers to incinerate 78 civilians, wounded many more, and destroyed most of the hamlet.Lewy (1978), pp. 275‚Äì276. Terror results could also be achieved by provoking hasty reaction or retaliation attacks by ARVN or American forces on villagers through sniping, raids, or placing of mines and booby traps in and near villages or hamlets. Such reactions had the benefit of sparking potential atrocities that could be used later in propaganda to help mobilize or radicalize elements of the populace. A 1965 Christian Science Monitor article by Japanese journalist Takashi Oka reported on what seemed to be use of the method. The VC entered a village and harangued the local populace about supporting the Revolution before digging in, and passing word to the district capital that they were active in the community. One day later, US planes bombed the village and its Catholic Church. VC operatives emerged after the destruction to tell survivors about the perfidy of the US imperialists.Doyle & Weiss (1984) Such methods could sometimes backfire however, with villagers blaming Front forces for the destruction and death brought to their communities. Several spectacular incidents of terror stand out in NLF/PAVN operations, although these were not publicized in the Western media to the extent of the American-perpetrated My Lai Massacre.Lanning & Cragg (1993), pp. 186‚Äì188. Massacre at Hue: During Tet for example, Communist forces seemed to have carefully planned for mass killings, with prepared hitlists carried both by the invading VC units and local infrastructure operatives. One of the sites of the worse atrocity was the city of Hue. Civil servants, officers, teachers and religious figures were rounded up first and executed after quick \\"revolutionary\\" trials. A second roundup fingered leaders of civic organizations, intellectuals, professionals and individual civilians and their families who had worked for the Americans. A barber for example who had cut the hair of Americans had both his hands cut off before being liquidated.Lewy (1978), p. 274. The greatest number of people eliminated however appeared to be during the Viet Cong retreat from the city. They were usually shot and buried in well-concealed mass graves that were eventually to yield some 2,800 corpses. Lack of visible wounds on some bodies, including 2 Catholic priests, indicated that they had been buried alive. The 2,800 bodies in Hue were part of a larger group of some 5,800 civilians in the city targeted in Viet Cong attacks for liquidation or abduction. Most of the remaining victims have never been found. ƒê·∫Øk S∆°n: 1967 the VC used flamethrowers to incinerate 252 civilians, mostly women and children at the village of ƒê·∫Øk S∆°n, in ƒê·∫Øk L·∫Øk Province. Thanh My: In 1970, at the village of Thanh My, near Da Nang, the PAVN killed an estimated 100 civilians as they huddled in bunkers for shelter, by tossing in grenades and satchel charges. Hit squads and assassinations. During the early years of the war, assassinations and other similar activity was organized via \\"special activity cells\\" of the VC. As the conflict extended, efforts were centralized under the VC Security Service estimated to number 25,000 men by 1970. By 1969, nearly 250 civilians were being murdered or kidnapped each week. The total tally of the NLF/PAVN terror squads from 1967 to 1972 stands at over 36,000 murders and almost 58,000 kidnappings according to one US Department of Defense estimate, c. 1973. Statistics for 1968‚Äì72 suggest that \\"about 80 percent of the terrorist victims were ordinary civilians and only about 20 percent were government officials, policemen, members of the self-defence forces or pacification cadres.\\"Lewy (1978), p. 273. Communist forces and spokesmen consistently denied using any terror, and attributed the mass graves at Hue to spontaneous action by various aggrieved peoples of the city. The use of terror however is encouraged in official NLF documents, such as COSVN Resolution Number 9, published in July 1969, which noted: \\"Integral to the political struggle would be the liberal use of terrorism to weaken and destroy local government, strengthen the party apparatus, proselyte among the populace, erode the control and influence of the Government of Vietnam, and weaken the RVNAF.\\" Intelligence Massive US and ARVN sweeps often failed to bring the VC to battle in significant numbers, and left the population vulnerable to organization and intimidation efforts. Communist forces deployed an extensive and sophisticated intelligence apparatus within South Vietnam, extending from the top echelons of the Southern regime, to village level guerrilla helpers informing on ARVN troop movements. Such was the penetration of the GVN that after the war the Communist government presented a medal to one of the top aides to South Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Cao Ky.Prados (1998), pp. 270‚Äì273. Ironically, the de facto chief of the South Vietnamese General Staff who was present on the last day of the war in Saigon (1975), was, according to Vietnamese sources, also a northern agent.John Prados, 2009. Vietnam: The History of an unwinnable war, 1945-1975, p530 Substantial assistance to the southern insurgency was rendered by the North via its Central Research Agency (CRA). This fifth-column built on the anti-French resistance of the Vietminh. The American CIA claimed that by the late 1960s, more than 30,000 enemy agents had infiltrated the GVN's \\"administrative, police, armed forces and intelligence\\" operations.Doyle et al. (1986), p. 26. In the South, the NLF's COVSN organization supervised intelligence efforts, deploying a secret police in communist controlled areas, a bodyguard service for VIPs and most importantly, a \\"People's Intelligence System.\\" Networks of informers were numerous and the system used blackmail, threats and propaganda to secure the cooperation of GVN functionaries, often working through their relatives. One South Vietnamese study of the communist apparatus cited several examples of intelligence gathering for the Front (NLF/PAVN) forces: *A bicycle repairman on the road that reported on military traffic *A farmer counting the number and type of aircraft that landed and took off on the airstrip near his fields *A peasant woman outside her hut reporting on the size and composition of enemy troops by pre-arranged signal, when they approached. Effectiveness of NLF and PAVN organization The Communist command structure was complex,Doyle et al. (1986), pp. 43‚Äì48 with a series of interlocking committees and directorates, all controlled by the Central Committee of Hanoi's Lao Dong (Communist) Party. This same pattern of interlocking groups was repeated further down the chain to the lowliest hamlet- all controlled by party operatives. This elaborate structure often appears ponderous to Western eyes, but it was extremely well adapted to the demands of the war effort, and its built in overlapping, duplication and redundancy made it resilient and able to adjust to defections, captures or deaths among its members. While the North Vietnamese and their allies made elaborate attempts to camouflage the organizational arrangements that drove the war, it is important to note that both the armed Viet Cong (properly the PLAF), and the regular troops of the PAVN were ultimately one joint force. Each had its distinct local characteristics, recruitment paths, resource bases, and missions, but collectively they were controlled as one by Hanoi, and are treated as such in official communist histories of the war.Merle Pribbenow (transl). 2002 \\"Victory in Vietnam.

Haji Mohd Hassan Bin Munas was nicknamed Tok Janggut ('old man with a beard' in Malay) because of his long beard which almost reached his chest. Early life Born in Kampung Jeram, Pasir Puteh, Kelantan in 1853, Tok Janggut received his early education (pendidikan pondok) in Kelantan and in Mecca and was a master of silat, a Malaysian martial art. His father was Panglima Munas, who served as a commander in the Kelantan palace. Rebellion After the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909, Britain took over the administration of Kelantan from Siam, and immediately made significant changes in its administration system, triggering a rebellion. The local government of Jeram, Pasir Puteh, and Kelantan was taken over by British administrators. British officer Encik Abdul Latiff took over the administration of Kelantan from the local leader, Engku Jeram. Latiff was viewed as an outsider by the Kelantan locals, both for his subservience to the British colonial administration and for the fact that, although Malay, he was not from Kelantan, which has a culture and dialect distinct from other Malay areas of Southeast Asia. Furthermore, anecdotal evidence suggests that Latif perhaps considered himself above the largely rural Kelantanese and was notably stern in his tax collection duties. The deposed local administrator, Engku Besar Jeram, called upon Tok Janggut, Haji Said, Che Sahak Merbol and Penghulu Adam to discuss the tense situation in Kelantan. At the meeting, a pact was signed by the participants which prohibited any one of them to co-operate with the British. Their independence fight gained support from most Kelantan residents, whose refusal to pay taxes meant the revenue of the district dropped by half in one year. In 1915, Latiff discovered that Janggut was responsible, and sent Sergeant Sulaiman and six other policemen to arrest him. The officers found him surrounded by 2,000 of his followers, many of whom were carrying weapons. Tok Janggut did not try and escape: he stood his ground and refused to go with the officers. In the heat of the argument, Janggut stabbed Seargeant Sulaiman with his keris. Sulaiman shortly died, and the crowd disarmed the other officers, who were sent back to Latif. Encik Latif attempted to rally the surrounding villages against Janggut, but this failed because Tok Janggut was now marching towards Pasir Puteh with his followers. Latif fled Pasir Puteh to avoid Janggut, and to seek an audience with the Sultan of Kelantan in Kota Bharu. Tok Janggut's forces fought against the British in Pasir Puteh, and the rebels triumphed. They remained in Pasir Puteh for three days and declared the independence of Pasir Puteh from British rule. Engku Besar was selected as Sultan of Pasir Puteh, with Tok Janggut as his chief minister. Having heard about Janggut's rebellion from Encik Latif, the Sultan branded Janggut a traitor and called a meeting with the state officials. The rebel leaders were ordered to surrender themselves within seven days, failing which they would be arrested and sentenced to death. They refused to surrender, and a $500 reward was offered to anyone who arrested Engku Besar, Tok Janggut, Haji Said, Haji Ishak or Penghulu Adam. In May 1915, 1,500 British troops marched to Pasir Puteh to attempt to quell the rebellion. Tok Janggut got wind of this, however, and advised his followers to flee. He and the other rebel leaders hid in the jungle, avoiding the troops. The soldiers returned to Singapore on 17 May, having failed in their mission. After the British troops withdrew, Tok Janggut came out of hiding. News of this reached the authorities in Kota Bharu, who decided to send Indian troops led by British officers in a second attempt at ending the rebellion. The rebel leaders went into hiding again, and out of anger the troops burnt down Jeram town, including the houses of Tok Janggut and many of his followers. Tok Janggut marched on Pasir Puteh town (where the Indian troops had gone after burning down Jeram) on 25 June 1915, with 1,000 of his followers, armed with guns and traditional weaponry. Even though the rebel forces outnumbered their enemy, the Indian troops were much better-equipped. Many of Tok Janggut's followers fled, and he himself was killed. All the corpses were buried except Janggut's: his dead body was exhibited throughout Kota Bharu and Pasir Puteh, as an example of the consequences of rebelling against government rule. Tok Janggut's body was buried in Kota Bharu afterwards, ending the rebellion against British rule in Kelantan.

McMaster served as the general manager for both the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds and the Sudbury Wolves of the Ontario Hockey League, prior to working with the Kings. McMaster's tenure with the Kings is best remembered for trading Wayne Gretzky to the St. Louis Blues in 1996. Early career McMaster began his hockey career as the general manager for the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds of the Ontario Hockey League in 1984. After one season, McMaster left the team to become the director of hockey operations for the Washington Capitals, a position he held for three seasons. McMaster returned to the OHL in 1988, when he was appointed the general manager for the Sudbury Wolves. McMaster assembled a Wolves team that was a perennial playoff contender, but often failed to make a substantial run. Los Angeles Kings McMaster was hired by the Los Angeles Kings in May 1994, replacing Nick Beverley as the team's general manager, inheriting a team which was one year removed from its first Stanley Cup Finals appearance. McMaster watched the team go into a free fall during the strike-shortened 1994-95 season, which prompted him to fire popular head coach Barry Melrose and assistant coach Cap Raeder with seven games left in the season as the team bottomed out to finish with a 16-23-9 record.Kings Turning to McMasterL.A. KINGS FIRE HEAD COACH, ASSISTANT The following season, McMaster hired former Kings defenseman Larry Robinson as head coach. Despite the optimism, the Kings regressed to the bottom of the league's standings. The team was placed in bankruptcy protection during the off-season following the arrest of the team owner Bruce McNall, which forced McMaster to shed salary by trading away the team's veteran players, while faced with having to deal with a disgruntled Wayne Gretzky, who was unhappy with the direction of the team.KINGS CROWN ROBINSON AS THEIR HEAD COACHFive Stages of the Trade That Sent Wayne Gretzky to St. Louis Faced with growing frustration from Wayne Gretzky, on 27 February 1996, McMaster traded Gretzky to the St. Louis Blues for three prospects, Craig Johnson, Patrice Tardif and Roman Vopat, along with a 5th round pick in 1996 (Peter Hogan) and a 1st round pick in 1997 (Matt Zultek). The trade wound up being disastrous for both teams. Gretzky played only 31 games for the Blues, while the players McMaster acquired did not amount to anything substantial for the Kings. While Johnson was able to earn a full-time roster spot with the team, both Tardif and Vopat left the league within three years, while Hogan and Zultek failed to make it to the NHL altogether.Feb. 27: Gretzky traded to Blues by KingsThe Other Gretzky Trade: That Deal That Worked For Neither Team Following the Gretzky trade, McMaster traded away the remaining core players from the 1993 Stanley Cup finalist team, save for Rob Blake in an attempt to rebuild the roster. As a result of his efforts, McMaster earned a two year extension from the Kings on 20 May 1996.Kings Extend Sam McMaster‚Äôs Contract Two Years Despite not being able to maximize his returns on trades, McMaster was able to acquire future Kings mainstays Mattias Norstrom and Ian Laperriere. Another noteworthy trade McMaster made was acquiring Stephane Fiset from the Colorado Avalanche in exchange for Eric Lacroix, who was the son of Avalanche general manager Pierre Lacroix. Due to his performance at the draft table and questionable player acquisitions, McMaster earned the nickname \\"McMaster the Disaster\\" from fans and media alike. McMaster was fired in 1997 after posting a 68-106-38 record over three seasons and would later be replaced by former Kings player Dave Taylor.

Development In late 1971, the Army Air Mobility Research and Development Laboratory, which later became a part of the Army Research Laboratory, awarded Sikorsky a contract for the development of the first prototype. The S-69 was the demonstrator for the Advancing Blade Concept (ABC).Michael J Taylor: The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Helicopters, page 20. Exeter Books, New York, NY USA, 1984. The first S-69 built (73-21941) first flew on July 26, 1973. However, it was badly damaged in a low-speed crash on August 24, 1973 due to unexpected rotor forces and insufficient control systems. The airframe was then converted into a wind tunnel testbed, which was tested in the NASA Ames Research Center 40x80 feet full-scale wind tunnel in 1979.Felker, Fort III.

After initial testing as a pure helicopter, two auxiliary turbojets were added in March 1977. As a helicopter, the XH-59A demonstrated a maximum level speed of , but with the auxiliary turbojets, it demonstrated a maximum level speed of and eventually a speed of in a shallow dive. At level flight, it could enter a 1.4 g bank turn with the rotor in autorotation, increasing rotor rpm. Airframe stress prevented rotor speed reduction and thus full flight envelope expansion. The XH-59A had high levels of vibration and fuel consumption.Robb, Raymond L. Hybrid Helicopters: Compounding the Quest for Speed p. 48, Vertiflite, Summer 2006. The 106-hour test program for the XH-59A ended in 1981. In 1982 it was proposed that the XH-59A be converted to the XH-59B configuration with advanced rotors, new powerplants (two GE T700s), and a ducted pusher propeller at the tail. This proposed program did not proceed as Sikorsky refused to pay a share of the costs.Croft, John. Hyper Helos: Prototypes coming off the drawing board and into the race, Flightglobal.com 3 July 2008. Accessed: 9 March 2012. Sikorsky and its partners funded the development of the next helicopters using the Advancing Blade Concept; the Sikorsky X2 and Sikorsky S-97 Raider from 2007.

At high speeds, the retreating blades were offloaded, as most of the load was supported by the advancing blades of both rotors and the penalty due to stall of the retreating blade was thus eliminated.Chandler, Jay. \\"Advanced rotor designs break conventional helicopter speed restrictions (page 1) \\" Page 2 Page 3 .

Forward thrust was provided by two turbojets, which allowed the main rotor to only be required to provide lift. It was found to have good hover stability against crosswind and tailwind. With jets installed, it lacked power to hover out of ground effect and used short take-off and landing for safety reasons.

Life and career Hart was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York. After two years as an undergraduate at Dartmouth, he transferred to Columbia University, where he joined the Philolexian Society and obtained his A.B. (1952) and Ph.D., both in English literature. During the Korean War he served in U.S. Naval Intelligence, in Boston. After a short period teaching at Columbia, Hart became Professor of English literature at Dartmouth for three decades (1963‚Äì1993). Hart specialized in 18th century literature but also had a fondness for modernist literature. He was popular with the students, from whom he required a great deal of writing. His political apostasy annoyed his faculty colleagues: when they were concerned about fossil fuels he made it a point to commute to campus in a Cadillac limousine; he might have a mechanical hand drum the table when faculty meetings were too long. In 1962 he joined William F. Buckley's conservative journal National Review as a book reviewer, requiring a trip from Hanover, New Hampshire to New York City every other week. Later, he would contribute as a writer and senior editor for the better part of the ensuing three decades even as he fulfilled his teaching responsibilities as a professor at Dartmouth. In one review for the magazine he wrote, \\"The liberal rote anathema on 'racism' is in effect a poisonous assault upon Western self-preference.\\" Hart took a leave of absence from Dartmouth in 1968 to work for the abortive presidential campaign of Governor of California Ronald Reagan. This role led to brief service as a White House speechwriter for Richard Nixon. After nomination by his former student Reggie Williams, Hart was honored with his college's Outstanding Teaching Award, 1992. He has also received the Young America's Foundation Engalitcheff Prize, 1996, among other academic accolades. In 1998, he served as a visiting lecturer at Nichols College. The Dartmouth Review was founded in his living room in 1980, and he has served as an adviser to it since then. He wrote a regular column for King Features Syndicate and retired from teaching. In recent years, he launched a fierce Burkean critique of the policies of President of the United States George W. Bush in the pages of the American Conservative, the Washington Monthly, and The Wall Street Journal. Hart supported John Kerry in the 2004 election and Barack Obama in 2008. He died on February 16, 2019, a week before his 89th birthday.

Immersion suits usually have built-in feet (boots), and a hood, and either built-in gloves or watertight wrist seals. Suits manufactured by several manufacturers also include an inflatable pillow which is permanently attached high on the back, or an inflatable tube that is attached with zippers at two points on the chest, each side of the main zipper, and circles the back. When inflated, both of these devices provide enhanced stability to the wearer, so that, if conscious, allows them to have enhanced stability with the head above water, and the ability to keep wind and seas from striking the face. The inflation tube is routed from the inflatable pillow over the left shoulder of the user, and secured in a loop on the chest. Some immersion suits are manufactured with straps/clips and hooks to allow multiple survivors to attach to one another in the water. This practice keeps survivors together. As well, some suits are manufactured with built-in hoisting lanyards, to allow easier retrieval from vessels with a higher seaboard, that may have manual or mechanical hoisting capabilities. The first record of what has previously been known as a \\"survival suit\\" was in 1930 when a New York firm American Life Suit Corporation offered merchant and fishing firms what it called a safety suit for crews of ocean vessels. The suit came packed in a small box and was put on like a boilersuit.\\"Safety Suit Like Coveralls Warm and Water Tight\\" Popular Mechanics, March 1930 The ancestor of these suits was already invented in 1872 by Clark S Merriman to rescue steamship passengers. It was made from rubber sheeting and became famous by the swim records of Paul Boyton. It was essentially a pair of rubber pants and shirt cinched tight at the waist with a steel band and strap. Within the suit were five air pockets the wearer could inflate by mouth through hoses. Similar to modern-day drysuits, the suit also kept its wearer dry. This essentially allowed him to float on his back, using a double-sided paddle to propel himself, feet-forward. Additionally, he could attach a small sail to save stamina while slowly drifting to shore (because neither emergency radio transmitters nor rescue helicopters were invented yet). The first immersion suit to gain USCG approval was invented by Gunnar Guddal. Eventually the suit became accepted as essential safety gear. Usage These suits are in two types: =Designed to be worn all the time= This type is chosen to fit each wearer. They are often worn by deep-sea fishermen who work in cold water fishing grounds. Some of these garments overlap into scubadiver-type drysuits. Others may have many of the features of an immersion suit. Since humans are warm blooded and sweat to cool themselves, suits that are worn all the time usually have some method for sweat to evaporate and the wearer to remain dry while working. * Some aircraft aircrew dry suits are constructed of a breathable, fire-retardant material that allows water vapor to escape but prevents liquid from entering. * Some aircraft pilot survival suits use a solid impregnable material such as rubber-backed cotton, which is connected to a forced-air cooling system. Ventilation air is supplied via air hoses inside the vehicle cabin. In an emergency, the hoses can be rapidly disconnected and the ventilation access ports close on the suit. =Only worn in emergency / vessel abandonment= The first 'survival suits' in Europe were invented by Daniel Rigolet, captain of a French oil tanker. Others had experimented on similar suits abroad. Unlike work suits, \\"quick don\\" immersion suits are not normally worn for work, but are stowed in an accessible location on board the craft. The operator may be required to have one immersion suit of the appropriate size on board for each crew member, and other passengers. If an immersion suit is not accessible both from a crew member's work station and berth, then two accessible suits must be provided. This type of immersion suit's flotation and thermal protection is usually better than an immersion protection work suit, and if the suit is properly maintained, may extend in- water survival for a person who is trained in its use. An adult immersion suit is often a large bulky one-size-fits-all design meant to fit a wide range of sizes. Two types of materials are used. Neoprene suits, without additional insulation, and suits constructed of a trilaminate waterproof material, with a snap-in insulating liner made from thin foam sheets cut and glued to form the suit, with a rayon backing to make donning the suit easier. These suits typically have large oversize booties to accommodate various foot sizes. Gloves may be built into the suit, or be stored in easy access pouches art the end of the sleeves. These suits will have a waterproof zipper in front for access. These zippers must be properly maintained or the suit may not function properly. There is generally a face flap to somewhat seal water out around the neck and protect the wearer from ocean spray. Because of the oversized booties and large mittens, quick don immersion suits are often known as \\"Gumby suits,\\" after the 1960s-era children's toy. The integral gloves may be a thin waterproof non-insulated type to give the user greater dexterity during donning and evacuation, with a second insulating outer glove tethered to the sleeves to be worn while immersed. A ship's captain (or master) may be required to hold drills periodically to ensure that everyone can quickly access the immersion suit storage in an emergency, and don the suit in the allotted amount of time. In the event of an emergency, it should be possible to put on an immersion suit in 60 seconds. The Submarine Escape Immersion Equipment is a type of survival suit that can be used by sailors when escaping from a sunken submarine. The suit is donned before escaping from the submarine and then inflated to act as a liferaft when the sailor reaches the surface. Construction Survival suits are normally made out of red or bright fluorescent orange or yellow fire-retardant neoprene, for high visibility on the open sea. The neoprene material used is a synthetic rubber closed-cell foam, containing a multitude of tiny air bubbles making the suit sufficiently buoyant to also be a personal flotation device. The seams of the neoprene suit are sewn and taped to seal out the cold ocean water, and the suit also has strips of SOLAS specified retroreflective tape on the arms, legs, and head to permit the wearer to be located at night from a rescue aircraft or ship. = Open neck vs closed neck sealing = The method of water sealing around the face can affect wearer comfort. Low-cost quick-donning suits typically have an open neck from chest to chin, closed by a waterproof zipper. However, the zipper is stiff and tightly compresses around the face resulting in an uncomfortable fit intended for short-duration use until the wearer can be rescued. The suit material is typically very rigid and the wearer is unable to look to the sides easily. Suits intended for long-term worksuit use, or donned by rescue personnel, typically have a form-fitting neck-encircling seal, with a hood that conforms to the shape of the chin. This design is both more comfortable and allows the wearer to easily turn their head and look up or down. The suit material is designed to be either loose or elastic enough to allow the wearer to pull the top of the suit up over their head and then down around their neck. Safety features Immersion suits can also be equipped with extra safety options such as: * A whistle to permit the wearer to signal for help * An emergency strobe light beacon. * Tethered mittens to better insulate the hands * A PLB, AIS Man Overboard Transponder. * Sea dye markers and floating streamers to increase visibility in water. Inflatable survival suits The inflatable survival suit is a special type of survival suit, recently developed, which is similar in construction to an inflatable boat, but shaped to wrap around the arms and legs of the wearer. This type of suit is much more compact than a neoprene survival suit, and very easy to put on when deflated since it is just welded from plastic sheeting to form an air bladder. Once the inflatable survival suit has been put on and zipped shut, the wearer activates firing handles on compressed carbon dioxide cartridges, which punctures the cartridges and rapidly inflates the suit. This results in a highly buoyant, rigid shape that also offers very high thermal retention properties. However, like an inflatable boat, the inflatable survival suit loses all protection properties if it is punctured and the gas leaks out. For this reason, the suit may consist of two or more bladders, so that if one fails, a backup air bladder is available. Immersion suit maintenance Each immersion suit needs to be regularly checked and maintained properly in order to be ready for use all the time. The maintenance of the immersion suits kept on board of the vessels must be done according to the rules of the International Maritime Organization (IMO). There are two Guidelines issued by IMO - MSC/Circ.1047 and MSC/Circ.1114 in relation to immersion suits‚Äô maintenance. The first one gives instruction for monthly inspection and maintenance which must be done by the ship's crew. The second one is concerning pressure testing which can be done only with special equipment. Usually, it is done ashore by specialized companies but can be done also on board the vessels if practical. It must be performed every three years for immersion suits less than 12 years old and every second year on older ones. The years are counted from the suit's date of manufacture.

Built in 1849 and opened in February 1850, the station saw some of the earliest bloodshed of the American Civil War (1861-1865), and was an important rail link during the conflict. Today, it is the oldest surviving big-city railroad terminal in the United States and, after a nine- year preservation campaign and a year-long restoration/reconstruction/renovation completed April 1997, houses the Baltimore Civil War Museum. History The Baltimore and Port Deposit Rail Road (B&PD;), founded in 1832, completed a rail line from Baltimore to the western shore of the Susquehanna River in 1837. The railroad's Baltimore terminus was on the east side of the \\"Basin\\" (now known as the Inner Harbor), at the southern end of President Street. The B&PD; exchanged freight cars with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;), (oldest railroad line in the country - established 1827) which had built a track (along Pratt Street) to the eastern Basin harbor area from its original Mount Clare depot on the western side of the central business district. The B&PD; and its merger successor company, the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad (PW&B;), transferred passengers to the B&O;'s first downtown depot at East Pratt and South Charles streets by a horse-drawn car on B&O;'s connecting track. (The Baltimore City Council prohibited the operation of locomotives on this track for reasons of frightening horses and fears of fires). By 1838, the PW&B; was carrying passengers from further northeast through Philadelphia to Baltimore, where they could transfer to the B&O; and continue west to Ohio or by a new branch line further south to the national capital at Washington, D.C. The PW&B; started building its own station at the southwestern corner of President Street with Canton Avenue with train yards, including a roundhouse, shops and freight warehouses of about six square city blocks, extending east along Canton Avenue (later renamed Fleet Street). The Greek Revival-style station opened on February 18, 1850. In addition to the brick head house with a distinctive arched roof, the original station also had a long barrel vaulted train shed over the tracks. The PW&B; added a similarly styled freight house, adjacent to the south of the passenger station, in 1852. The President Street Station and its eastern yards and shops of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad portrayed in 1869, twenty years after construction On February 23, 1861 President-elect Lincoln, on his inauguration Whistle-Stop train ride, transferred from the President Street Station to Camden Station in order to thwart the Baltimore Plot assassination attempt.,Road to Lincoln's end ran through Baltimore, Jonathan M.

Kline, Chapter 16, An Unexpected Arrival, pg. 258-259 The station was involved in the Baltimore riot of 1861, as Massachusetts state militia troops bound for Washington were being pulled in several connecting horse cars and later marching to the B&O; Camden Street Station, ten blocks west and were attacked by an angry mob of Southern and Confederate sympathizers, with a large number of civilians and four soldiers killed and many people wounded in the ensuing melee. On Friday, April 19, 1861, Baltimore Southern sympathizers attacked the passing 6th Massachusetts infantry regiment of the state militia and the \\"Washington Brigade\\" of Philadelphia from the Pennsylvania state militia. Both units were heading to the national capital at Washington to reinforce defenses in response to the requests for troops in his proclamation declaring the existence of an insurrection by 16th President Abraham Lincoln after the firing on Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor in South Carolina by newly organized Confederate States military forces a few days earlier. President Street Station during the Great Depression, 1936 In 1873, the newly organized Union Railroad built a new set of tracks in northeastern Baltimore, connecting the original PW&B; main line with the Northern Central Railway (NCRY) going north to York and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The new connection ran through the new Union Tunnel to NCRY's new Charles Street Station, north of Mount Royal Avenue. (This station was rebuilt twice, in 1911, named as \\"Union Station\\" and ultimately renamed \\"Pennsylvania Station\\" in the 1920s.). This station on North Charles Street and its successors in the northern reaches of the city largely replaced the earlier President Street Station on the southeast for passenger service. The latter continued to serve as a freight station into the 1940s World War II era but served some passenger trains until 1911. The Pennsylvania Railroad, which acquired the PW&B; in a merger in 1881, demolished the President Street's eastern train shed after heavy snow damage in 1913 and erected a new, shorter shed, built with wooden roof trusses. Post-railroad use In the 1970s it was used as a trucking terminal. On the left, behind the head house, is the train shed that was added in 1913 and replaced the original 1850 shed. The President Street Station was later used as a warehouse. The train shed was destroyed by fire, leaving only the present head house by 1970, when it was abandoned. In 1979, the derelict building was acquired by the City of Baltimore, which planned to demolish it to clear the way for a proposed southern extension of the Jones Falls Expressway (Interstate 83) to connect in an interchange near the harbor with the east - west Interstate 95 which was never built. In 1989, the station's wooden arched roof collapsed in a snowstorm. As a museum Historic 1850 front facing west, but now back of the current Baltimore Civil War Museum, 2008. This was the front entrance to the historic passenger station. In the 1990s, a public- private partnership pushed by a supporters group, the Friends of the President Street Station (FofPSS), funded the reconstruction/restoration/renovation of the vacant station and historic site, which reopened in April 1997 as the \\"Baltimore Civil War Museum\\" with the assistance of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Museum at the Mount Clare Shops. President Street Station, Inc. operated the museum until 2000, when the building lease was partnered with the Maryland Historical Society (MdHS), located on their campus of buildings on West Monument Street, until 2006. The lease/partnership arrangement with the City and the FoPSS originally expired in 2017. The museum temporarily closed in 2007, due to budget constraints by the MdHS in connection with their nearby extension at the new Fells Point Maritime Museum on Thames Street, then re- opened on weekends only, operated by MdHS and subsequently by FofPSS volunteers. The Civil War Museum was open on weekends in February 2010, in observance of Black History Month, although heavy snowfall forced closure of the museum on two weekends. The future of the historic property is uncertain: In 2009, the City of Baltimore announced plans to designate the old depot as a landmark, which would restrict modifications to the building's exterior, and to request proposals for commercial development of the grounds. FofPSS opposes this, and called instead for the station's preservation and management as a museum by the National Park Service. The director of Baltimore City's Commission for Historical and Architectural Preservation, which will review proposals, said that any commercial use \\"must be subordinate to the history\\" and that a multi-use partnership would be ideal. On February 13, 2015, U.S. Senators Barbara Mikulski and Benjamin Cardin introduced bill , \\"The President Street Station Study Act,\\" which would authorize the National Park Service to study the suitability and feasibility of absorbing the station.

By 1914, he opened a New York area studio specifically organized to make animated films. Unlike newspaper cartoonist Winsor McCay, who had been making short animated films for several years, Bray organized his studio according to the principles of industrial production, an approach that Raoul Barr√©, another animator, also adopted at around the same time. Colonel Heeza Liar and the Bandits (1916) As the 1910s progressed, Bray's studio became a powerhouse in the early animation industry. The studio assembled a staff that included many accomplished animators, and it produced a steady and widely distributed stream of animated shorts. Bray contributed a series featuring his Colonel Heeza Liar series, which was among the most popular series of animated shorts in that era. Bray produced the first animated film in color, The Debut of Thomas Cat (1920), in Brewster Color. Bray Productions produced over 500 films between 1913 and 1937, mostly animation films and documentary shorts. Cartoonist Paul Terry worked briefly for Bray Studios in 1916. The entertainment branch of Bray Pictures Corporation closed in 1928. Documentary production for theatrical release continued through the late 1930s. The educational and commercial branch, Brayco, made mostly filmstrips from the 1920s until it closed in 1963. Bray Studios was still in operation in the early 1980s. J.R. Bray died in Bridgeport, CT at the age of 99 in 1978. Jam Handy's company, the Jam Handy Organization, began as a Chicago-Detroit division of Bray Studios, to service the auto industry's need for industrial films. Jam Handy made several thousand industrial and sponsored films and tens of thousands of filmstrips, many for the auto industry, closed in 1983. Bray visited Winsor McCay during his production of Gertie the Dinosaur and claimed to be a journalist writing an article about animation. McCay was very open about the techniques that he developed and showed all the details to Bray. John Randolph Bray later patented many of McCay's methods and unsuccessfully tried to sue the other animator; McCay prevailed, however, and received royalties from Bray for several years thereafter.

Usage in factoring algorithms A factor base is a relatively small set of distinct prime numbers P, sometimes together with -1. Say we want to factorize an integer n. We generate, in some way, a large number of integer pairs (x, y) for which x eq \\\\pm y, x^2 \\\\equiv y^2 \\\\pmod{n}, and x^2 \\\\pmod{n} \\\\text{ and }y^2 \\\\pmod{n} can be completely factorized over the chosen factor base‚Äîthat is, all their prime factors are in P. In practice, several integers x are found such that x^2 \\\\pmod{n} has all of its prime factors in the pre-chosen factor base. We represent each x^2 \\\\pmod{n} expression as a vector of a matrix with integer entries being the exponents of factors in the factor base. Linear combinations of the rows corresponds to multiplication of these expressions. A linear dependence relation mod 2 among the rows leads to a desired congruence x^2 \\\\equiv y^2 \\\\pmod{n}. This essentially reformulates the problem into a system of linear equations, which can be solved using numerous methods such as Gaussian elimination; in practice advanced methods like the block Lanczos algorithm are used, that take advantage of certain properties of the system. This congruence may generate the trivial \\\\textstyle n = 1 \\\\cdot n; in this case we try to find another suitable congruence. If repeated attempts to factor fail we can try again using a different factor base. Algorithms Factor bases are used in, for example, Dixon's factorization, the quadratic sieve, and the number field sieve. The difference between these algorithms is essentially the methods used to generate (x, y) candidates. Factor bases are also used in the Index calculus algorithm for computing discrete logarithms.

Early Naval Career  Ault served briefly as an enlisted man in the Navy (19 April 1917 ‚Äì 23 April 1918) before entering the Naval Academy as a midshipman. Graduating on 2 June 1922, Ault served at sea on the battleship before reporting to the Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, on 23 August 1924 for flight instruction. After earning his wings, Ault served with Aircraft Squadrons, Scouting Fleet, before commencing a tour in the aviation unit of the light cruiser on 10 September 1925. Detached from that ship just over a year later, he served at the Naval Academy as an instructor before reporting for duty with Observation Squadron (VO) 3, Aircraft Squadrons, Scouting Fleet, on 15 June 1927. Further duty at the Naval Academy, as an instructor in the Department of Ordnance and Gunnery, followed before he flew with Patrol Squadron (VP) 10-S, Scouting Fleet, based in aircraft tender . He then served on the staff of Capt. George W. Steele, Commander, Aircraft, Scouting Force, from June 1931 to June 1932 and alternated tours of duty afloat and ashore: in Torpedo Squadron (VT) 1-S, based on board ; at NAS Norfolk, Virginia; and in the observation unit of the battleship . Ault‚Äîby this time a lieutenant‚Äînext assisted in fitting-out , thus becoming a \\"plank owner\\" of that ship when she went into commission in the autumn of 1937. He then served on Yorktown's sister ship, , commanding VT-6. On 5 August 1939, less than a month before the start of World War II in Poland, Ault assumed command of the Naval Reserve Aviation Base, Kansas City, Kansas, a billet in which he served into 1941. On 22 July 1941, Lieutenant Commander Ault once more reported to Lexington, and, the following day, became her air group commander. He was serving in that capacity when the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 drew the United States into World War II.  World War II  Ault helped to plan and execute the attacks on Japanese shipping at Lae and Salamaua, New Guinea, in March 1942. On the day before the strike, 9 March, Ault and a wingman flew to Port Moresby, where the group commander learned of the existence of a key mountain pass through the forbidding Owen Stanleys, information that, in the words of the task force commander, contributed \\"a great deal toward [the] success\\" of the attacks that ensued. On the day of the raid, 10 March, Ault, given the authority to carry out or abort the attack on the basis of what weather he found, flew unaccompanied to the pass and orbited. Finding favorable weather, he transmitted information to that effect and directed the passage of planes from Lexington and Yorktown toward Lae and Salamaua. Those groups sank three transports, put a fourth transport out of action, and caused varying degrees of damage to a light cruiser, a minelayer, three destroyers and a seaplane carrier. The transmontane raid postponed the Japanese projected conquest of Tulagi and Port Moresby for a month, the time necessary to replace the vital amphibious ships lost off New Guinea and marshal carrier air support. Commander, Aircraft Battle Force, later commended Ault for his work.  Battle of the Coral Sea  In the later Battle of the Coral Sea in May 1942, as Lexington's Air Group Commander, Ault led Lexington's bombers into combat in the successful May 7 attack on the Japanese aircraft carrier Sh≈çh≈ç, sinking the light carrier fifteen minutes after the first attack.ShohoHyperWar: USSBS: Campaigns of the Pacific War The Sh≈çh≈ç was the first Japanese aircraft carrier sunk in World War II.Battle of the Coral Sea Early in the morning on 8 May, Ault led the Lexington airwing's attack on the Japanese fleet carrier Sh≈çkaku. The attack was successful; the Sh≈çkaku was damaged severely enough to warrant its removal from battle and its return to base at Chuuk.Battle of the Coral Sea Both Ault and his radio-gunner, Aviation Radioman 1st Class William T. Butler, apparently suffered wounds when Zero fighters attacked the group commander's SBD Dauntless.From Coral Sea to Whidbey Island  Wings of Gold  Find Articles at BNET.com Ault attempted to return to a friendly carrier deck, not realizing that the Lexington had taken mortal damage in his absence. Unaware of Lexington's distress, he radioed the ship at 14:49, to tell her that he had only enough gasoline for 20 minutes. Yorktown, which had taken over communications for \\"Lady Lex,\\" heard Ault's broadcast but failed to pick him up on her radar. Informed that he was on his own but wished \\"Good luck.\\" Ault changed course to the north, in a last vain attempt to be picked up on radar. Yorktown again wished him good luck.

William B. Van Alstyne, M.D. April 1908 Pg 118 was a grandson of Harmen Jansen Knickerbocker, of Friesland, Holland, one of the earliest settlers of New York. Knickerbocker completed preparatory studies, studied law in the offices of John Vernon Henry and John Bird, was admitted to the bar in 1803 and commenced practice in Albany. He moved to Schaghticoke (near Albany) and became known as \\"the Prince of Schaghticoke\\" because of his hospitality and liberality. Military service Knickerbocker served in the militia in the early 1800s. Initially appointed the commander of a cavalry troop with the rank of captain, in 1810 he was promoted to major in New York's 3rd Cavalry Regiment. According to an 1816 newspaper article from Troy, New York, Knickerbocker was still active in the militia as the commander of a squadron in the 3rd Regiment, and led it during its annual muster and parade. Career Knickerbocker served on several occasions as Schaghticoke's town supervisor, including 1805 to 1806, 1813, 1818 to 1823, and 1825 to 1826. In 1808, Knickerbocker was elected as a Federalist to the Eleventh Congress, holding office from March 4, 1809 to March 3, 1811. During his term, Knickerbocker was concerned chiefly with alleviating the effects of the Jefferson administration's Embargo Act of 1807. According to a newspaper article that appeared in 1833, his maiden speech argued against the embargo, and he described the economic and financial condition of his constituents caused by the embargo so dramatically that the members of the House were reduced to convulsions of laughter. Knickerbocker was not a candidate for reelection in 1810 and opposed U.S. involvement in the War of 1812. He served in the New York State Assembly in 1816. Knickerbocker became an adherent of Andrew Jackson in the mid 1820s, and joined the Democratic Party. He was judge of the Rensselaer County court from 1828 to 1838. Personal life In 1801, he married his first wife, Arietta Lansing (d. 1814), the daughter of Abraham Lansing and Else Van Rensselaer. They had five children before her death in 1814, four of his daughters attended the Troy Female Seminary: * Abraham Lansing Knickerbocker (b. 1802) * Elizabeth Maria Knickerbocker (b. 1805) * Catharine Knickerbocker (b. 1808) * Rebecca Knickerbocker (b. 1813) In December 1814, he married for the second time to Rachel Wendell (d. 1823), daughter of John H.

While originating in Greater China, they may also apply to Chinese-speaking people around the world. However, most homonymic pairs listed work only in some varieties of Chinese (for example, Mandarin only or Cantonese only), and may appear bewildering even to speakers of other varieties of Chinese. Certain customs regarding good and bad luck are important to many Chinese people. Although these might be regarded as superstitions by people from other cultures, these customs are often tied to religious traditions and are an important part of many people's belief systems, even among well-educated people and affluent sectors of society. Clocks Giving a clock (ÈÄÅÈêò/ÈÄÅÈíü, s√≤ng zh≈çng) is often taboo, especially to the elderly as the term for this act is a homophone with the term for the act of attending another's funeral, \\"to send off for one's end\\" (ÈÄÅÁµÇ/ÈÄÅÁªà, s√≤ngzh≈çng).http://www.sohu.com/a/160882715_578225 Âà´‰∫∫ËøáËäÇÂñúÂ∫ÜÁöÑÊó∂ÂÄôÔºå‰∏çÈÄÅÈíüË°®„ÄÇÈÄÅÁªàÂíåÈÄÅÈíüË∞êÈü≥„ÄÇ A UK government official Susan Kramer gave a watch to Taipei mayor Ko Wen-je unaware of such a taboo which resulted in some professional embarrassment and a pursuant apology. Cantonese people consider such a gift as a curse.Susan Kurth Clot deBroissia International Gift Giving Protocol This homonymic pair works in nearly all varieties of Chinese, as the words for \\"clock\\" and \\"end\\" came to be pronounced identically very early in mainstream Chinese varieties, by around 11th century. That being said, this taboo does not apply to smaller items such as watches, as they are not called \\"zh≈çng\\" in most parts of China, unlike clocks and large bells; watches are commonly given as gifts in China. However, should such a gift be given, the \\"unluckiness\\" of the gift can be countered by exacting a small monetary payment so the recipient is buying the clock and thereby counteracting the (\\"to gift\\") expression of the phrase. Fans and umbrellas It is undesirable to give someone a fan or an umbrella as a gift. The words fan \\"sh√†n\\" () and umbrella \\"s«én\\" () sound like the word \\"s«én/s√†n\\" (), meaning to scatter, or to part company, to separate, to break up with someone, to split.Wong Yee Lee Gifts in Chinese Culture These homonymic pairs work in Mandarin and Cantonese. Cantonese has a more idiomatic term for umbrellas (\\"ze1\\" in Cantonese, ) to avoid precisely this association. Books As a book () is a homophone of \\"loss, to lose\\" () in many areas, carrying or looking at a book () where people are taking a risk, such as gambling or investing in stocks, may be considered to invite bad luck and loss ().

Encyclopedia of Fantasy and Horror Fiction. Infobase Publishing. p. 152. 2006. . ‚Äì May 7, 2011) was an American fantasy writer most famous for authoring the Circle of Light series and creating the fictional universe of Atlanton Earth. After being out of print for several years, his novels were reprinted by Tor Books. Hancock's fantasy books are grouped into three sets of four books each. A stand-alone novel, Dragon Winter, is set in the same fictional universe, but not explicitly part of the larger storyline. Hancock wrote high fantasy marketed for adults, but his works contain straightforward plots and tropes such as anthropomorphic animals more traditionally found in children's literature. For this reason, his works enjoy a great degree of popularity among younger readers as well. Containing spiritual overtones similar to Ursula K. Le Guin, C. S. Lewis, and J. R. R. Tolkien, Hancock's books emphasize Buddhism and Eastern religious motifs. His books were released at a time when interest in high fantasy was at a peak, and very little writing in that genre existed. Straddling the gap between young adult and adult fantasy, Hancock's books have remained popular well after their original publication. As the genre expanded in the 1970s, however, contemporary interest in his books waned and they came to be regarded as \\"commodified fantasy\\" employing the quest template from Richard Adams' Watership Down.Stableford, Brian. Jon Woronoff, ed. Historical Dictionary of Fantasy Literature. \\"Animal Fantasy\\". Scarecrow Press. p. 14. 2005. .Stableford, Brian. Jon Woronoff, ed. The A to Z of Fantasy Literature. Scarecrow Press. p. 14. 2009. . Like Lewis' Narnia series, the Atlanton Earth novels were not published in the chronological order of the events in the fantasy world itself. The first set, Circle of Light, is the last to occur in the chronology. The second set, The Wilderness of Four, is the earliest. The final set, The Windemeir Circle, is in the middle. Dragon Winter is set some time after the second set, although it is the most ambiguous of the novels because it does not belong to a set. As an early contributor to the mass- market fantasy genre, Hancock's fate is similar to his contemporary Elizabeth H. Boyer in that his books required the reader to be interested in a specialized area of study (in this case, Buddhist philosophy) in order to fully appreciate the books, and thus he did not find the sort of wide acceptance which would have given him a more prominent place as a pioneer in the genre. He died in Deming, New Mexico.  Thematic elements  Hancock's approach to the high fantasy genre has been held to separate him from other authors. While other authors are merely influenced by Eastern beliefs (such as Le Guin), Hancock's fantasy was constructed to explicitly include Buddhist concepts of moving through cycles of time and rebirth. The river \\"Calix Stay\\" of his books is very similar to the river out of samsara in the Dhammapada. Characters cross this river into another world, but are soon reborn back into their lower world to work out their karma. The books use the framework of the traditional fantasy quest, but this quest is often secondary to the real plot, which centers on the struggle to escape samsara in the fantasy world. The plot is often difficult to follow, particularly to those unfamiliar with Buddhist thought, which may explain why Hancock never achieved the same degree of classic status as other early authors in the fantasy genre who explored spiritual themes. Hancock freely intermingled talking animals and humanoids in his books (including humans, elves, masters of sorcery, etc.). In the first set of books, the animals are able to change into humans and pass as human. Later sets blur the distinction and have animals and humans together. Hancock's universe has an ambiguous technological setting. Sometimes, the world he creates is like that of Tolkien, a primitive sword-and-sorcery world. At other times, it becomes modern with warfare resembling the state of technology in World War One (or, perhaps, the American Civil War). Hancock was a veteran of the Vietnam war and used his experiences in writing his fantasy books. His world, however, does not seem to have the automatic weapons and helicopters of that war.

Adventure is a dark ride featured at Universal Studios Florida, and formerly, the Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Japan theme parks. The ride is based on the movie E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. E.T. Adventure's animatronics were manufactured by Sally Corporation. History E.T. Adventure originally opened at Universal Studios Florida in 1990. One year later, the attraction opened in Universal Studios Hollywood. In 2001, the third installation of this attraction was opened in Universal Studios Japan. On March 14, 2003, the Hollywood version was closed and replaced by Revenge of the Mummy: The Ride. More recently, on May 10, 2009, the Japanese version was closed and replaced by Space Fantasy: The Ride. The Orlando version is still operating as of 2020, and received a refurbishment in 2017. E.T. Adventure was also expected to open at Universal Studios South Korea in 2021. In 2012, the ride at Universal Studios Florida received new track switches by Dynamic Structures. Summary The ride at Universal Studios Florida has guests begin by entering a sound stage. Some elements of this description may not be accurate for the Hollywood and Japan installations. =Exterior queue= The exterior queue is themed to a sound stage where E.T. is being filmed. TV monitors above guests' heads display the filmmakers discussing their experiences on creating the film as well as E.T. trivia. There are also E.T. posters from the film's 30th Anniversary re-release on display near the end of the queue, in English and various other languages. Guests are then ushered into the pre-show room. =Pre-show= Before going into the interior queue, Steven Spielberg appears on TV screens above the guests and tells them that E.T.'s teacher Botanicus needs E.T. to come back to his home world, \\"The Green Planet\\", because the planet is dying. Only E.T.'s magical healing touch can save the planet and its inhabitants, so it is up to the guests to bring him home. He also tells the guests that they'll make their journey on bikes and that they'll need an \\"Interplanetary Passport\\" to get there. The guests then enter a second room where they give their name to one of \\"Spielberg's assistants\\" which is programmed into a card that is used later in the ride. Prior to the 20th anniversary, the pre-show had an additional wraparound, stating that the ride is the set for a sequel, and the guests are the actors playing the parts. The \\"Interplanetary Passports\\" were originally called \\"Passes\\", and the \\"assistants\\" were \\"stagehands\\". =Interior queue= The interior queue is a forest setting where it is established that the police are looking for E.T. and the guests. In the interior queue, Botanicus is seen beaming down from his ship every few minutes, pleading for E.T.'s return. On the way, the guests pass by a Speak & Spell seen in the movie, while the letters H-E-L-P E-T come onto the screen of it while its signature loud clacking is heard, then the letters erase and ad lib. A hare from the film pops up every few seconds. The guests then board the ride vehicles. There is also a customized \\"pine fresh\\" scent created by scent marketing company, ScentAir., Manufactured Smells as a Marketing Tool =Ride= Each individual seat is a bicycle, whose handles come down as the lap bars. The bike in the middle of the front row contains E.T. However, in the attraction's early years, guests also had the option of riding in a spaceship modeled after the one that E.T. came to Earth on in the movie; these ride vehicles were removed as guests preferred to ride the bikes, given how iconic they were in the famous flying scene in the movie. The vehicles travel past NASA and police officials who give chase and try to arrest the riders and capture E.T. As they are about to be caught, a police car appears out of nowhere and just as they are about to hit it, the bicycles begin to fly over the city and then into outer space. From their bikes, the guests can see a miniature city below, including real moving cars and even a football stadium and two baseball fields. The bikes are then transported to a kind of portal area with flashing lights which, when finally turned around, arrives at the Green Planet. The guests then encounter Botanicus, who urges the visitors to save E.T.'s friends. E.T.'s healing touch travels through the Green Planet, reviving his friends and beginning a celebration with numerous baby E.T.s frolicking and playing. This lasts for about 3 minutes and is a huge contrast to the beginning; the beginning is dark and scary while this part of the ride is light and colorful, with spurting water and singing. At the end, the guests pass an animatronic E.T. who thanks them all by the names that they gave to the travel agents/Spielberg's Assistants. Then, in a flash of light, guests are sent back to Earth and into the unload area. As guests leave the ride, they can sometimes hear E.T.'s voice reminding them, \\"I'll be right here.\\" See also * Incidents at Universal parks (info on 2004 incident in Japan) * List of amusement rides based on film franchises References External links * E.T.

Jordan is bordered by the Twenty Mile Creek and Vineland to the west, Lake Ontario to the north, St. Catharines to the east, and Pelham to the south. Lying roughly 100 km from Toronto and 65 km from Buffalo by road, Jordan is located along a major transportation corridor between Canada and the United States. In January 2014 Jordan was brought to international attention when Al-Qaeda-directed terrorists were arrested for plotting to derail a passenger train traveling from Toronto to New York on a rail-bridge crossing the Jordan Harbour. Jordan is home to many wineries due to its climatically advantageous grape-growing conditions in the Niagara Region, and is one of the premier icewine-producing destinations in Canada. Also located in Jordan is the Ball's Falls Conservation Area, which is maintained by the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority, and the home of the second-tallest waterfall in the Niagara Region. Geography Jordan's climate is humid continental (K√∂ppen borderline Dfa/Dfb) and can be considered a unique micro- climate because of the moderating influence of Lake Ontario/Lake Erie and the sheltering effect of the Niagara Escarpment. The area is known in Canada for its orchards, vineyards, wineries and restaurants that feature local produce and wines. Fruit crops grown in Jordan include cherries, peaches, apples and pears, and during the summer attract many tourists from all over Ontario, particularly Toronto, Ontario. =Climate= History Most of the early settlers were German in origin, and were devout practicing Mennonites.Exploring Niagara:Jordan, Ontario These Mennonites (Pennsylvania Dutch) walked north from the United States in 1799, and founded the villages of Jordan and Vineland.

The short was released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer on August 1, 1958. It is the last Tom and Jerry theatrical cartoon produced or directed by both Hanna and Barbera, and the last cartoon short of the series until Gene Deitch's Switchin' Kitten in 1961. Barbera would return to direct one final Tom and Jerry theatrical short, The KarateGuard, in 2005. Plot Babysitter Jeannie (voiced by Julie Bennett) is instructed to look after the baby while his mother (also voiced by Julie Bennett) goes out. However, Jeannie begins talking on the telephone with someone, ignoring the baby and its carriage. In the midst of Tom and Jerry's usual fighting, they see the baby crawling out of its pram. Any attempt to return the baby to where it came from simply results in the baby escaping from the pram again. During one escape, the baby crawls into Spike's dog house. Tom accidentally grabs Spike instead of the baby, and is promptly pummelled. This time, Tom angrily brings the baby back to Jeannie herself, who hits Tom over the head with a broom, thinking that Tom has taken the baby away from her. Realizing that the baby is no longer worth the trouble, Tom does nothing the next time that it crawls from its pram. However, he and Jerry are forced to react after the baby crawls down to the street and into a 100-story mixed-use skyscraper construction site. The baby crawls from one steel beam to another while the two look on. Jerry manages to catch up, and saves the baby from crawling off a wooden plank lying on the 50th floor by grabbing his diaper. The diaper comes loose, and the baby falls, but he is then caught by Tom. Tom attempts to put the baby's diaper back on, but in the impending confusion, ends up putting the diaper on himself while the baby crawls off, nonchalantly. Tom and Jerry catch up with the baby, only to lose it again. Fearing that it has crawled into a cement mixer on the 30th floor, the two dive straight in, only to find that the baby never entered the mixer but is instead playing with a hammer. Later on, Jeannie is in panic and tells a police officer that she lost the baby she was babysitting. Tom and Jerry would arrive tired with the baby. Jeannie grabs the baby while the two try to escape, but the police officer (voiced by Bill Thompson) arrests Tom and Jerry, assuming that they were \\"baby nappers\\". In the police car, Tom and Jerry explain of what really happened, but the police officer doesn't believe them. Just then, to their surprise, the baby crawls past the police car and away into the distance (apparently having been neglected by Jeannie once again), making the police officer realize in shock that Tom and Jerry were telling the truth. Production Tot Watchers was produced by MGM Cartoons. After the departure of producer Fred Quimby from the Tom and Jerry series in 1956, directors William Hanna and Joseph Barbera took the added responsibility of producing the series themselves. According to animation historian Michael Barrier, it was during the post-Quimby period that the effects of the series' lower budget on its animation quality became more obvious, stating that \\"there was no hiding corner cutting behind a curtain of stylization\\". Scott Bradley's score for Tot Watchers was recorded on June 6, 1957. Reception Writer and historian Michael Samerdyke stated that Tot Watchers, though it will \\"never be considered one of the best of the series, ... is an entertaining cartoon and points the way to how the series would develop in the Sixties.\\" Home media *\\"Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection, Vol. 2\\" (2005) *\\"Tom and Jerry's Greatest Chases, Vol. 5\\" (2010) References External links * * Category:1958 films Category:1950s American animated films Category:1958 comedy films Category:1958 animated films Category:1958 short films Category:CinemaScope films Category:American animated short films Category:American films Category:Films about babies Category:Films scored by Scott Bradley Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer animated short films Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer short films Category:Short films directed by Joseph Barbera Category:Short films directed by William Hanna Category:Tom and Jerry short films ","title":"Tot Watchers"},{"id":"8026773","text":"David Shapiro (born January 2, 1947) is an American poet, literary critic, and art historian.

In 2016, the line Rawang-Port Klang Line was merged with the Rawang-Tanjung Malim shuttle service, thus ending Rawang's role as the northern terminus of the line. The station built to cater the traffic around the suburb of Rawang as there were no other commuter or mass transit services in the Klang Valley that stopped here before the arrival of the KTM Komuter. Extension On April 21, 2007, a shuttle service between Rawang and Rasa was launched. The service, which extends the KTM Komuter network by 22 km, covers three new stations, namely Serendah, Batang Kali and Rasa. This is the first stretch of the problem-prone and much-delayed Rawang-Ipoh electrification and double-tracking project to become operational.

The KISS Army is the official fan club for the American rock band Kiss, as well as the unofficial name used to refer to Kiss fans in general. It was started unofficially in 1975, by fans Bill Starkey and Jay Evans. The membership form displayed for the first time what became known as the official Kiss Army logo, which was designed by Dennis Woloch and Vincent DiGerlando of Howard Marks Inc., the advertising agency working with Bill Aucoin and Kiss at that time. History In January 1975, Starkey and Evans, two teenage Kiss fans from Terre Haute, Indiana, began contacting local radio station WVTS in an effort to get Kiss music played. After being repeatedly turned down by program director Rich Dickerson, Starkey and Evans began calling WVTS claiming to be \\"the Kiss Army.\\" Additionally, they sent letters to the station and signed them, \\"Bill Starkey‚ÄìPresident of the Kiss Army,\\" and \\"Jay Evans‚ÄìField Marshall.\\"Gooch, Curt and Jeff Suhs. Kiss Alive Forever: The Complete Touring History. Billboard Books, 2002. By July 1975, WVTS had begun to play Kiss records, often referring to the Kiss Army. Some of the letters included threats to blow up the station. Before long, listeners started calling the station asking how they could enlist. Dickerson worked with Starkey and Evans to provide advance promotion for a Kiss concert at the new Hulman Civic-University Center in Terre Haute. Before the show, Kiss publicist Alan Miller contacted Starkey to discuss the Kiss Army. At Miller's request, Starkey and Evans took phone calls on the air at WVTS to recruit as many members as possible for the Kiss Army. As a result of these efforts, the November 21 show sold out (10,000 seats). During the concert, Starkey was brought on stage and given a plaque by Kiss. Soon after the Terre Haute concert, the Kiss Army became the official fan club of the group. In 1976, Kiss manager Bill Aucoin requested Howard Marks Inc. to create an official Kiss Army logo. The logo was designed by Dennis Woloch, long time KISS art director from a concept by his co-worker Vincent DiGerlando. Order forms for the Kiss Army first appeared with this new official logo in 1976's Destroyer. Former head of Kiss merchandising Ron Boutwell estimated that the fan club (at its peak) earned US$ 5,000 per day, and had nearly 100,000 members.Leaf, David and Ken Sharp. Kiss: Behind the Mask: The Official Authorized Biography, Warner Books, 2003. After a period of inactivity, Kiss announced the re- launch of the Kiss Army as the group's official fan club on August 23, 2007. On May 29, 2008, Condoleezza Rice, the United States Secretary of State enlisted in the Kiss Army. In celebration of the Kiss Army's 35th anniversary, November 21, 2010 was declared \\"Kiss Army Day\\" in Terre Haute. Starkey served as a guest DJ for local rock radio station WWVR.

Although other categories have been recognized in the past, the Awards currently recognize the best Fiction, Nonfiction, Poetry, Translated Literature, and Young People's Literature published each year. The honored titles in each category are decided by an independent panel of writers, librarians, booksellers, and critics. These panels of five judges in each category select a Longlist of ten titles per category, which is then narrowed down to five Finalists. Winners are announced at the National Book Awards Ceremony and Benefit Dinner in November. = Lifetime Achievement = In addition to the five National Book Awards presented each year, the Foundation presents two lifetime achievement awards: the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters and the Literarian Award for Outstanding Service to the American Literary Community. = 5 Under 35 = The 5 Under 35 program was started in 2005 in order to honor five debut fiction writers, all under the age of thirty-five. The honorees are all chosen by previous National Book Awards‚Äìhonored writers or 5 Under 35 honorees. Each award comes with a cash prize of $1,000. The 5 Under 35 Ceremony has been hosted by Questlove, Carrie Brownstein, LeVar Burton and others. = Innovations in Reading Prize = Each year, the National Book Foundation's Innovations in Reading Prize awards $10,000 to an individual or organization that has developed an innovative project which creates and sustains a lifelong love of reading in the community they serve.

Other programs =Education and access= BookUp BookUp, the National Book Foundation's flagship educational program, believes reading for pleasure has a direct and substantial impact on young people's success in school and careers. During after-school and summer programs, BookUp connects middle- and high-school students with local authors and runs free reading groups designed to improve participants' social, emotional, and literacy skills. Young people also interact directly with the local literary community through author visits and field trips to libraries, museums, and bookstores. Since its start in 2007, BookUp has given away over 35,000 free books, and each year helps 500 students build their first home libraries. In addition to books that groups select and read together in a book club‚Äìstyle format, students are given a budget to purchase books of their choosing during shopping trips to local bookstores. The program currently serves students at over 20 different sites in New York City, Detroit, Los Angeles, and Huntsville, TX.  Book Rich Environments  Book Rich Environments is a tri-sector collaboration between nonprofit organizations, national government agencies, and corporate publishers that aims to infuse public housing communities across the country with a vibrant and accessible culture of books. The initiative connects families living in public housing communities with reading-related resources, working to improve opportunities and outcomes for public housing residents. National Book Foundation serves as the project lead, with U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, U.S. Department of Education, the Urban Libraries Council, and the National Center for Families Learning serving as key planning partners. 37 HUD-assisted communities across the country serve as local partners, implementing the following three key initiative components: * Book Distribution ‚Äì free, high quality, diverse books provided to children and families living in HUD- assisted housing. * Library Engagement ‚Äì young people and families engaged in the love of reading and connected with the ongoing literacy activities offered by the local public library. * Partnership Building ‚Äì strategic partnerships on the local level, established between the local public housing authority, the local library, and local literacy partners to develop and deliver ongoing community and educational programming. The program is made possible through the generous book donations provided by major U.S. publishers.  Raising Readers  National Book Foundation partners with the NYC Department of Youth & Community Development (DYCD) to run the Raising Readers initiative. This innovative program aims to empower adults who work with and raise children to expand their own love of books and reading, in order to better model the habit of reading for pleasure with the young people in their lives. Raising Readers provides paid professional development training for DYCD provider staff who work with young people through after-school and summer programs, and pairs staff with NBF teaching artists to collaboratively run reading circle series for parents at local DYCD sites across the city, complete with book giveaways, high-profile author talks, and book shopping opportunities for participants.  Teen Press Conference  The Teen Press Conference invites middle and high school students in New York City to interview the five Young People's Literature Finalists the day before the National Book Awards. Students are provided copies of the Finalists' books and are able to attend a book signing after the program. = Public programs =  NBF Presents  NBF Presents programs bring National Book Awards‚Äìhonored authors and nationally recognized moderators to libraries, colleges, book festivals, and performance venues for public readings, discussions, and presentations. NBF Presents is designed to give audiences‚Äîwhether in urban, suburban, or rural communities‚Äîaccess to some of our country's most renowned writers and their books and to create spaces where authors and audiences can connect, be in dialogue, and share ideas. NBF Presents, under which the Foundation's public programs became grouped in 2018, was partially modeled after the long-running National Book Awards on Campus program, which began in 2005. National Book Awards on Campus brought National Book Award winners and finalists to college campuses at Sam Houston State University, Concordia College, Amherst College, and Rollins College. These academic institutions continue to host NBF Presents events each year.  Literature for Justice  Literature for Justice (LFJ) is a nationwide, book-based campaign that seeks to contextualize and humanize the experiences of incarcerated people in the United States. The program is guided by the Literature for Justice committee, an assemblage of well-known authors who are also experts, leaders, and advocates within the space of mass incarceration. This committee is tasked with the creation and selection of a reading list of five books annually to guide readers through this complex issue, with the hope that these texts will help shift public perception and understand of mass incarceration through the power of storytelling. Collectively, the selected books tell a story about America's carceral system and what it means for all Americans. In addition to publicizing and promoting the LFJ reading list, the National Book Foundation presents several large-scale public events featuring authors and experts on mass incarceration, accompanied by digital assets like supplemental reading recommendations and further commentary from the LFJ committee. The 2018‚Äì19 LFJ committee members are Sergio De La Pava, James Forman, Jr., Mitchell S. Jackson, Rachel Kushner, and Heather Ann Thompson. The 2018‚Äì19 selected titles are: * A Place to Stand, by Jimmy Santiago Baca (Grove Press, June 2002) * Shahid Reads His Own Palm, by Reginald Dwayne Betts (Alice James Books, June 2010) * Upstate: A Novel, by Kalisha Buckhanon (St. Martin's Press, January 2006) * Understanding Mass Incarceration: A People's Guide to the Key Civil Rights Struggle of Our Time, by James Kilgore (The New Press, September 2015) * Inside This Place, Not of It: Narratives From Women's Prisons, edited by Ayelet Waldman and Robin Levi (Verso Books, July 2017)  Author in Focus  The National Book Foundation's Author in Focus program seeks to highlight and reframe the work of selected, historical authors from the National Book Awards family whose work is deserving of a renewed celebration and revival. Author in Focus consists of a year of nationwide educational and public programming celebrating these important writers and contextualizing their work for today's reader. The 2018‚Äì19 selected author is James Baldwin, a four-time National Book Award Finalist.  Why Reading Matters Conference  Why Reading Matters is designed to bring together educators, non-profit administrators, librarians, academics, publishing professionals, writers, and literary activists of all kinds to discover and share ways to welcome more readers into their community. The National Book Foundation's third annual Why Reading Matters conference was held on June 7, 2018 at St. Francis College in Brooklyn, and included a full day of presentations focused on reading without boundaries.  Eat, Drink & Be Literary  Started in 2006, Eat, Drink & Be Literary is the National Book Foundation's partnership with BAM to create an intimate evening of food and literary conversation. Each event begins with dinner, wine, and live music. Then the evening's featured author reads from his or her work and discusses the creative process. Guests are encouraged to ask questions and have their book signed at the conclusion of the evening.  Notes from the Reading Life  Notes from the Reading Life is a discussion series featuring some of New York City's most well-known and well-read residents discussing the books that excite and inspire them‚Äîthe books they grew up with and the ones that guided them through their careers, helping to make them into who they are today. Presented in partnership with the New York Public Library, Notes from the Reading Life takes place branches throughout the city, with each event featuring a special guest from fields such as culture, art, entertainment, or public service in conversation with an acclaimed author‚Äîcelebrating the formative role of books in both of their lives. Audience members receive free copies of a book selected in partnership with the speakers and local librarians, and each branch produces special future programming around that book.

It is the largest annual arts festival in England and one of the largest fringe festivals in the world. Brighton Fringe 2018 took place from 4 May ‚Äì 3 June. The programme of 2018 included 1008 events at over 166 venues across 4 weeks.  Introduction  Brighton Fringe runs at a similar time to Brighton Festival, and in 2013 extended its run to four weeks. One of the event's main objectives is to promote local talent and the arts. It also offers performers an opportunity for their event to be reviewed or picked up by promoters, as well as going on to Edinburgh. This is why anyone can put on a Brighton Fringe event. In 2011 Brighton Fringe launched the Professional Development Programme, aimed at offering workshops to aspiring performers wanting to progress in the business. In 2012, Brighton Fringe opened its own on-street box office, which provided a physical base for the arts event, selling tickets as well as being a hub for promoters and performers. They also launched \\"Brighton in the Square\\", a showcase of Brighton Fringe performers at the Leicester Square Theatre in London. As part of the 2012 Cultural Olympiad, Brighton Fringe introduced the Dip Your Toe project in 2012, which featured performances in six custom-built Victorian bathing machines, which were located throughout Brighton and Hove during the month of May. In 2014, the organisation launched an Arts Council England supported scheme called \\"Window\\" which showcases productions suitable for touring. Brighton Fringe is a registered charity but does not rely on public funding, in fact, less than 3% of its income is generated from public sources. The other sources of revenue include participants‚Äô registration fees, advertising, sponsorship and Friends memberships.  History  Fringe activity has run alongside Brighton Festival since its creation in 1967. In 1972 Sussex University student Titus Alexander set up a society to stage fringe events, including a centenary play The Legend and True History of Aubrey Beardsley, with Christopher Pope as Beardsley, which went to the Edinburgh Fringe. The Fringe established itself as a limited company and registered charity in October 2006, with its own board of directors and complete financial independence from the Festival. In 2012 it rebranded itself as Brighton Fringe. In this period of time the organisation more than doubled in size, increasing from 323 shows in 2007 to 719 in 2012, bringing visitors into the city and boosting tourism and local businesses. The programme of 2018 included two new seasons. The Freedom Season ‚Äì a programme of events that are accessible to a range of audiences with access needs, including those with physical and invisible disabilities, and the Finnish Season. Furthermore, 2018 also saw the return of the Dutch Season and the return of late-night Fringe City. The current CEO is Julian Caddy. In 2020, Brighton Fringe was scheduled to run from 1 May until the 31 May; however due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the festival was rescheduled for an unconfirmed date in September or October 2020.  Open access  Brighton Fringe is an open- access mixed arts event, which means it does not book performers, but is approached by people wishing to put events on and be part of the Fringe. Participants can vary from the complete beginner to the hardened professional show, and everything in between. Therefore, anyone can put an event on as part of Brighton Fringe.  Venues  A venue for Brighton Fringe can be anything; from a large concert hall or theatre to a private house, a park, or on one occasion, a bath. With the increase of large high-profile venues, some commentators have suggested that Brighton Fringe may be reaching a similar profile as the Edinburgh Fringe.  Fringe City  Picture from \\"Fringe City\\" on the opening day of the 2007 Brighton Festival Fringe In a similar vein to the use of the Royal Mile at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, \\"Fringe City\\", a free event taking place in the New Road, Pavilion Gardens and Jubilee Street area of Brighton, was first introduced in 2007. By 2008, it was taking place every Saturday of May, and provides a showcase for any of the performers from the Fringe. In 2015, Fringe City saw audiences of 75,000, and in 2016, Fringe City saw audiences of 100.000, and takes place every weekend throughout the festival, alongside Family Picnic events on some weekends.  Fringe Academy  Fringe Academy is a year-round programme of more than fifty free workshops providing skills-basked training, advice and support for individuals looking to expand their knowledge and understanding of the arts. Brighton Fringe brings thereby a host of experts from Brighton University and Arts Council England for instance, which secures a high level of learning.  Awards and Bursaries  Every year Brighton Fringe hand out awards in the various categories to the best events and companies participating in the Fringe. Most of the award winners then return to the Fringe each year to participate and spread the happiness and joy to the people. Furthermore, Brighton Fringe works closely together with local and national organisations and companies to put together a number of bursaries and funding opportunities for Brighton Fringe participants. A selection of the current awards and bursaries include: *WINDOW *The Pebble Trust Award *The Pebble Trust International Touring Bursary *Brighton Fringe Award  References External links * Category:Festivals in Brighton and Hove Category:Fringe festivals in the United Kingdom Category:Arts festivals in England Category:1967 establishments in England Category:Festivals established in 1967 ","title":"Brighton Fringe"},{"id":"8027084","text":"Matthew Justin Garrison (born June 2, 1970) is an American jazz bassist.

Founded in 1908, it has a total population of about 2,000 students.  Founding  St Mark's School was founded in 1908 by then-Reverend (later Bishop) Christopher Charles Watts of the Anglican Diocese of then-Swaziland. Reverend Watts was concerned by the lack of adequate education facilities for the children of members of the rapidly expanding colonial settler community in Eswatini. A staunch believer in quality education, Watts sought to establish a school that would eventually acquire the prestige of other Anglican boarding schools in Southern Africa (such as Michaelhouse and St John's College) and would thus provide a viable alternative for children within reasonable traveling distance of Mbabane. At the beginning of the school year in January 1908, with just four children who gathered in the ten-by-ten-foot room of the priest in charge of Mbabane, St Mark's School was born. From its establishment, enrollment grew rapidly and with a significant amount of support from the government of Swaziland and various private contributors the school quickly became established. Because of its significant successes especially in the Cape Matriculation Examination it quickly came to be widely regarded as the most prestigious school in the country, a position that would go unchallenged for almost six decades until the formation of Waterford Kamhlaba by Michael Stern in 1963. Motto At its establishment, 'Nisi Dominus' was adopted as the school motto. The motto is a summarization of the Latin translation of Psalm 127: \\"nisi Dominus aedificaverit domum in vanum laboraverunt qui aedificant eam nisi Dominus custodierit civitatem frusta vigilavit qui custodit\\" meaning \\"unless the Lord builds the house, they work on a useless thing who build it; unless the Lord guards the community, he keeps watch in vain who guards it.\\" Notable alumni Notable St Mark's students include: *Patrice Motsepe, executive chairman, African Rainbow Minerals Ltd (ARM); chairman of Harmony Gold (), deputy chairman Sanlam; president, Business Unity South Africa (BUSA); president, Chambers of Commerce and Industry South Africa (CHAMSA); president, Mamelodi Sundowns football club. *Phuthuma Nhleko, group chief executive officer of MTN telecommunications group *Richard E.

It offers Internet access and telecommunications services for residences and businesses. SK Communications was founded in 1999 as Lycos Korea, a 50-50 venture of Lycos of the United States and Mirae Corp. of South Korea. The firm was sold to SK Telecom in 2002 and changed its name to SK Communications. SK Telecom currently holds 85.9 percent of its shares. Overview SK Communications was created when parent SK Telecom merged the recently acquired Lycos Korea with its cable Internet unit NetsGo in 2002. NetsGo is the developer of Nate, a popular web portal in the Korean market. Lycos Korea had trouble differentiating itself from competition. With no clear image to anchor its position in the Korean market, Lycos declined in popularity and was soon incorporated into the Nate portal. The Lycos domain name was shut down at midnight on December 27, 2002, typing its address (www.lycos.co.kr) directed visitors to Nate's homepage. In 2003, Nate acquired Cyworld, one of the leading social networking services in South Korea. To gain ground in the heatedly contested search market, SK Communications acquired rival Empas for $82 million in October 2006. The deal also included acquiring Konan Technology, the exclusive provider of search technology to Empas. After its takeover, Empas continued to operate independently with complete autonomy over its management and workforce. However, in the aftermath of SK Communications' decision to incorporate Empas search services into its flagship Nate portal, the Empas domain name was shut down in 2008 and the brand ceased to exist soon after. To further integrate its services, SK took over professional blogging service Egloos in the same year. Acquisitions * Cyworld * Cymarket * Egloos * Empas * Etoos * SK i-media 2011 Data breach In July 2011, SK Communications was hacked in one of the largest data breaches in South Korea's history. The attack, which is believed to have been conducted from Chinese IP addresses, had compromised SK Communication‚Äôs update server as its reached out to its supplier for a routine check up, according to the analysis, effectively turning the company‚Äôs security procedures into a vulnerability. Hackers used vulnerabilities in the system to gain access to the personal data and IDs of 35 million Nate and CyWorld social network users. The attack currently stands as 10th on DataLossDB‚Äôs list of largest all-time breaches, with 35 million people affected. In February 2013 a Seoul court has ruled that SK Communications should pay KRW 200,000 ($185.48) in damages to each ID theft victim in a class action lawsuit against SK Communications filed by 2,737 ID theft victims. On the ruling court said, Internet security firms ESTsoft and Symantec who provided security software to SK Communications were also named defendants in the case, however the court found that they were not liable for damages.

He was born in Yonkers, New York, graduated Columbia University (which holds a collection of his papers), was a veteran of World War I serving in France as a field artillery lieutenant, began his newspaper career at the New York Herald, and became managing editor of Liberty. He was married to Elizabeth T. Wheeler and had one daughter, the film editor Elizabeth Wheeler, who died in 1956. He is known primarily as the founder of several newspaper syndicates, of which the largest was the North American Newspaper Alliance (NANA), and through which he employed some of the most noted writing talents of his day.  Syndicates  In 1913, while still a sportswriter for the Herald, Wheeler formed the Wheeler Syndicate to specialize in distribution of sports features to newspapers in the United States and Canada. That same year his Wheeler Syndicate contracted with pioneering comic strip artist Bud Fisher and cartoonist Fontaine Fox to begin distributing their work. Fisher is reported to have received an annual guarantee of $52,000, an unprecedented amount at that time. Journalist Richard Harding Davis was sent to Belgium as war correspondent and reported on early battlefield actions, as the Wheeler Syndicate became a comprehensive news collection and distribution operation. In 1916, it was purchased by the McClure Syndicate, the oldest and largest U.S. news and feature syndicate. Immediately upon the sale of the Wheeler Syndicate to McClure, Wheeler founded another, the Bell Syndicate which soon attracted Ring Lardner, and was joined by cartoonists Fisher and Fox. James J. Montague also contributed his column \\"More Truth than Poetry\\" and other articles. In 1924, Wheeler became executive editor of Liberty magazine, and served in that capacity while continuing to run Bell Syndicate. In 1930, he became general manager of the North American Newspaper Alliance, established in 1922 by 50 major newspapers in the United States and Canada which absorbed Bell, both continuing to operate individually under joint ownership. NANA continued to acquire other syndicates, including the McClure Syndicate. In 1947, Cape Wheeler in Antarctica was named after him. Wheeler's autobiography, I've Got News for You, was published in 1961.Williamson, Samuel T. \\"Footnotes on Headliners and Byliners: I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU.

By the time he sold NANA in 1966 to the publishing and media company, Koster-Dana, he had employed many of the most influential writers of his time, including Grantland Rice, Joseph Alsop, Dorothy Thompson, Pauline Frederick, Sheilah Graham and F. Scott Fitzgerald. It was Wheeler who hired Ernest Hemingway to cover the Spanish Civil War, who inscribed for him a copy of For Whom the Bell Tolls, \\"To Jack Wheeler, who gave me the chance to go to war.\\" When he died on October 13, 1973, in Ridgefield, Connecticut, at the age of 87, his obituary in the Ridgefield Press described him as one who \\"never quit newspapering, permanently, until his death.\\" References = Notes = = Sources consulted = *Desmond, Robert W. \\"Wheeler, John Neville,\\" Encyclopedia Americana.

On April 1, 2007, it acquired the topix.com domain name and invited volunteers to edit the topics of their choice, on top of over 100 journalists and editors from various newspapers already signed up. Sometime in 2012 they took that volunteer edit option away without any communication to the thousands of volunteers. Topix went on to create a community news editing platform, and popular forum system, allowing users to comment on news articles and the goings on of local communities. Topix also created forums, organized by locality as well as by subject matter, which allow visitors to post comments whether or not they are relevant to a particular news story. The founders of Topix initially wanted it to be a news aggregator, with specific pages for every community in the United States. As Topix matured, most of its growth occurred in small cities and towns in the United States.

Although Topix was not a party to the lawsuit, it was forced to reveal the IP addresses of the posters. Initially Topix charged money to people who requested that Topix expedite the removal of negative posts. After thirty state attorneys general protested, Topix stopped charging. Jack Conway, the Kentucky Attorney General, said the charging scheme \\"smacked of having to pay a fee to get your good name back\\". On March 20, 2012, online gossip was the subject of a story called \\"Innocent Man's Life Destroyed by Anonymous Topix Poster\\" on Good Morning America.

He was the Member of Parliament for the electorate of Lake Macquarie in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 25 May 1991 until 24 March 2007. He was defeated at the 2007 election by the independent Mayor of Lake Macquarie, Greg Piper. He is the son of Merv Hunter, who was the Member for Lake Macquarie from 1969 to 1991. Biography Before entering State politics, Hunter was previously a power plant operator for the Electricity Commission of NSW (now Pacific Power). Whilst the Member for Lake Macquarie, Hunter sat and co- chaired on many Standing Committees including: Small Business, Road Safety, Health Care complaints, New South Wales Parliamentary Asia Pacific Friendship Group and the printing committee. Although he was electorally successful, he was never appointed to a ministerial portfolio something that was unusual for someone of his capabilities. Hunter succeeded his father, Merv Hunter, as Member for Lake Macquarie in 1991, his father had been the Member for Lake Macquarie 22 years. At the 2007 State election, Hunter was defeated by Greg Piper as the member for Lake Macquarie after 15 years, subsequently ending 37 years of Hunter family representation in Lake Macquarie in State Government. However, Jeff's younger brother, Allan, continued to serve as a Councillor in Local Government in the City of Lake Macquarie but retired at the 2008 Local Government elections. Hunter lost the seat of Lake Macquarie to Greg Piper, the Mayor of Lake Macquarie by 106 votes through preferences. Hunter has retired to the Southern Lake Macquarie suburb of Wangi Wangi and is enjoying his hobbies such as the environment, swimming, politics and horse riding. He is a current member of the Wangi Wangi Branch of the Labor Party and a delegate on the Party's executive.

It is present in most species of springtails, and in them it is attached ventrally to the fourth abdominal segment. The organ most often is present in species of Collembola that lives in the upper soil layers where it is used for jumping to avoid predators.Christian, E., 1978. The jump of the springtails. Naturwissenschaften 65:495-496. While at rest, it is retracted under the abdomen and held there by a structure variously called the retinaculum or hamula, which in turn is located beneath the third abdominal segment. When the furcula escapes from retinaculum, it swings downwards and hits the substrate, propelling the springtail into the air. The animal does not use this mechanism for ordinary locomotion, but only for escaping from predators or severe stress. One reason not to use the furcula for general locomotion other than to escape threats, is that its action is very unpredictable; when the furcula is released, the springtail is sent tumbling through the air on a practically arbitrary trajectory, and lands almost randomly. That may have advantages in escaping some forms of attack, but is not of much use in adopting any particular route. Although the action of the furcula is hard to predict, it is versatile. Even a springtail drifting on the surface tension of a layer of water often can jump successfully. Furthermore the furcula is effective in environments typical of Collembola; most predators of springtails are small and many have little power of sight, so if the prey leaps in time, the chances are that from the hunter's point of view, it simply vanishes. Some species of Collembola, for instance in the genus Hypogastrura, have only a very short furcula. Some other species have no furcula at all; examples include the intertidal marine species Anurida maritima and some riparian species that live on the brink of flowing fresh water. The absence of a furcula in such species commonly is explained as an adaptation to a way of life in which a jumping or flying organ might get the animals into trouble more often than it rescues them. Its loss presumably is analogous to the loss of the ability to fly, such as is common among birds and insects inhabiting oceanic islands.Rempel, Jenny. The Evolution of Flightlessness in Gal√°pagos Insects.

Biography Born in Rushden, Northamptonshire, Britton moved to London at a young age and apprenticed himself to a small coal-man (a charcoal merchant) in Clerkenwell. He learnt the trade and returned to his home village, but soon returned to London in search of better opportunities. Setting up a business to rival that of his former master, he turned a stable off Aylesbury Street into his store and home.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography In London, Britton became known for his singing voice.Paul Henry Lang, George Frideric Handel His business proved successful, and he spent much of his spare income on building up a library. Through this activity, he became known to other book collectors, and was able to meet and discuss literature with various nobles.Edwin Paxton Hood, Genius and Industry Britton also studied chemistry under the tutelage of his neighbour Theophilus Garenci√®res. He constructed a moving laboratory for Garenci√®res, and a Welsh friend of the scientist paid Britton to construct a similar building for him. Garenci√®res and Britton became friends, and also shared a love of esoteric ideas, Britton having an interest in Rosicrucianism. In 1678, Britton fitted the loft of his Clerkenwell house out as a tiny concert hall, fitting a harpsichord and an organ with only five stops. Despite the unglamorous venue, accessible only by an external staircase, the relative novelty of a series of concerts, coupled with the support of Roger L'Estrange, who inaugurated the venue with a performance on the viol, attracted a considerable audience. Britton's knowledge of literature and the arts became well known, and his modest and honest nature and acceptance of his social position was often noted. These were qualities appreciated by contemporaries who considered themselves socially superior. His concerts became regarded as the premier venue for chamber music in London, with an audience drawn from a wide social strata. At first, concerts were free, but Britton later requested an annual subscription of ten shillings, considered exceptionally low even at the time. By 1712, Ralph Thoresby was able to note: \\"In our way home called at Mr. Britton's, the noted small-coal man, where we heard a noble concert of music, vocal and instrumental, the best in town, which for many years past he has had weekly for his own entertainment, and of the gentry, &c.;, gratis, to which most foreigners of distinction, for the fancy of it, occasionally resort.\\" Britton's social successes sparked some jealousy, and his concerts were alleged to be meeting places for religious dissenters, atheists, or forums for political intrigue. However, their accessibility and the popularity of Britton gradually put paid to these rumours. The most highly regarded musicians in the nation came to play at Britton's house, including J. C. Pepusch, John Banister, Philip Hart, Abel Whichelo and it is generally held even George Frideric Handel, as did amateurs including John Hughes, Henry Needler and J. Woolaston. Matthew Dubourg played in public for the first time at Britton's, while Obadiah Shuttleworth is said to have learnt the organ specifically to be accepted as part of Britton's crowd. Britton himself played the viol de gamba and the recorder, and began to compose short pieces. Samuel Pepys regarded Britton as an expert on Tudor liturgical music. He amassed a large music collection and selection of musical instruments for the gatherings, and designed his own programmes. In 1694, Britton auctioned a substantial part of his library. Despite his social successes and considerable income, he continued to work as a small coal-man all his life. In September 1714, Justice Robe, a Middlesex magistrate, decided to play a practical joke on the superstitious Britton. He employed a ventriloquist named Honeyman to project his voice and tell Britton that his end was near and that he should fall to his knees and repeat the Lord's Prayer. The elderly Britton did so, and was so affected that he died within a couple of days. Legacy Green plaque at the site of Britten's house. Following his death, Britton's widow sold his collection of music, which was mostly purchased by Hans Sloane. A green plaque placed by the London Borough of Islington commemorates the site of his house in Jerusalem Passage, London EC1.

The nature of the computation in the project allows it to easily take advantage of distributed computing. This, along with the likely humanitarian benefits of the research, has led the World Community Grid (a distributed computing grid that uses idle computer clock time) to run the Fiocruz project. All products are in the public domain by contract with WCG. Description The problem is that a very large information body (structural, functional, cross-references, etc.) is attached to protein database entries. Once entered the information is rarely updated or corrected. This annotation of predicted protein function is often incomplete, uses non-standard nomenclature or can be incorrect when cross referenced from previous sometimes incorrectly annotated sequences. Additionally, many proteins composed of several structural and/or functional domains are overlooked by automated systems. The comparative information today is huge when compared to the early days of genomics. A single error is compounded and then made complex. The Genome Comparison Project performs a complete pairwise comparison between all predicted protein sequences, obtaining indices used (together with standardized Gene OntologyThe Gene Ontology website) as a reference repository for the annotator community.

The x-axis shows GDP per capita in 2005 international dollars, the y-axis shows life expectancy at birth. Each dot represents a particular country. The Preston curve is an empirical cross-sectional relationship between life expectancy and real per capita income. It is named after Samuel H. Preston who first described it in 1975. Preston studied the relationship for the 1900s, 1930s and the 1960s and found it held for each of the three decades. More recent work has updated this research. The relationship between life expectancy and income The Preston curve indicates that individuals born in richer countries, on average, can expect to live longer than those born in poor countries. However, the link between income and life expectancy flattens out. This means that at low levels of per capita income, further increases in income are associated with large gains in life expectancy, but at high levels of income, increased income has little associated change in life expectancy. In other words, if the relationship is interpreted as being causal, then there are diminishing returns to income in terms of life expectancy. Improvements in health technology shift the Preston Curve upwards. In panel A, the new technology is equally applicable in all countries regardless of their level of income. In panel B, the new technology has a disproportionately larger effect in rich countries. In panel C, poorer countries benefit more. A further significant finding of Preston's study was that the curve has shifted upwards during the 20th century. This means that life expectancy has increased in most countries, independently of changes in income. Preston credited education, better technology, vaccinations, improved provision of public health services, oral rehydration therapy and better nutrition with these exogenous improvements in health. According to Preston, the independent increases in life expectancy have been greatest in the poor countries, although he also believed that a good portion of the potential gains from better medical technology have not been realized. Several poor countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have actually seen declines in life expectancy in the 1990s and 2000s as a result of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, even if their per capita incomes have increased during this time. Overall Preston found that improvements in health technology (the upwards shifts in the curve) accounted for 75% to 90% of the increase in life expectancy, while income growth (movement along the curve) was responsible for the rest. Analysis of more recent data, for example by Michael Spence and Maureen Lewis, suggests that the \\"fit\\" of the relationship has become stronger in the decades since Preston's study. Though the source of income growth, rather than growth itself has been shown to be significant, with Ryan Edwards finding divergences from the Preston Curve partially explained by the size of the mining sector (a mining dominated economy). While the relationship between income and life expectancy is log linear on average, any one individual country can lie above or below curve. Those below the curve, such as South Africa or Zimbabwe, have life expectancy levels that are lower than would be predicted based on per capita income alone. Countries above the curve, such as Tajikistan, have life expectancies that are exceptionally high given their level of economic development. In 2000, the USA lay just below the curve, indicating that it had a slightly lower life expectancy than other rich countries.Anne Case and Angus Deaton, \\"Health and wellbeing in Udaipur and South Africa\\", 2006, pg. 4, pg. 39 If the relationship is estimated with nonparametric regression then it produces a version of the curve which has a \\"hinge\\" ‚Äì i.e. a kink in the relationship where the slope of the regression equation falls off significantly. This point occurs around the per capita income level of $2,045 (data for the year 2000) which is about the per capita income level of India. This level of income is generally associated with a crossing of a \\"epidemiological transition\\", where countries change from having most of their mortality occur due to infant mortality to that due to old age mortality, and from prevalence of infectious diseases to that of chronic diseases. Implications The fact that the relationship between income and health is concave indicates that a transfer of income from the rich to the poor would increase the average health of a society. However, this policy prescription will have this effect only if the relationship between income and health is causal ‚Äì i.e. if higher income causes longer life expectancy (see below). If the relationship is driven by other factors, if it is spurious, or if it is in fact health that leads to higher income, then this policy outcome will no longer be true. The existence of the Preston curve has been used by Lant Pritchett and Larry Summers to argue that poor countries should focus on economic growth, and that health improvements will come about spontaneously as a result of increases in income. According to these authors, in 1990 better economic performance could have prevented more than half a million child deaths worldwide. However, the upward shifts of the Preston curve still imply that the main portion of gains in life expectancy has come about as a result of improved health technology rather than just increases in per capita income. Preston did, however, acknowledge that in the poorest countries economic growth may be necessary for improvements in health, as even the most inexpensive technologies have a cost of adoption that poor countries may not be able to afford.Angus Deaton, \\"Health in the age of globalization\\", 2004 Preston's work has also contributed to the broadening of the definition of economic development. Gary Becker et al. have included longevity in a more general welfare measure and have illustrated that increases in life expectancy have made up a large portion of increases in overall global welfare since the 1960s. In the same work, Becker et al. also found that while cross-country incomes have diverged, the distribution of health has converged. Criticisms and shortcomings =Lack of longitudinal evidence= The Preston curve is a relationship found in cross-country data - that is, it holds for a sample of countries taken at a particular point in time. Some research however suggests that a similar relationship does not hold in time series and longitudinal data within individual countries. In particular, per capita incomes between countries have generally diverged over time, while life expectancies, and other health indicators such as the infant mortality rates, have converged (this trend was interrupted in the 1990s with the outbreak of the AIDS epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa). This suggests that over time changes in income may have no impact on health or even be negatively related. =Causality= A further limitation of the correlation is that it does not necessarily imply that the causality runs from income to health. It could actually be that better health, as proxied by life expectancy, contributes to higher incomes, rather than vice versa. Better health can increase incomes because healthier individuals tend to be more productive than sick ones; on average they work harder, longer and are more capable of focusing efficiently on production tasks. Furthermore, better health may affect not just the level of income but also its growth rate through its effect on education. Healthier children spend more time at school and learn faster, thus acquiring more human capital which translates into higher growth rates of incomes later in life. Diseases such as malaria can short circuit these processes. Likewise there is evidence that more healthy individuals save more and thus contribute to the faster accumulation of physical capital of an economy. Jeffrey Sachs in particular has emphasized the role that the disease burden has played in the impoverishment of countries located in the tropical zones.United Nations Millennium Project, 2006 The problem of reverse causality between health and income means that any estimates of the impact of income on life expectancy could mistakenly reflect the influence of life expectancy (more generically, health) on income instead. As such, studies which do not account for this potential two-way causation may overestimate the importance of income for life expectancy. In economic research, this kind of problem has traditionally been dealt with through the use of instrumental variables which allow the researcher to separate out one effect from another. This strategy requires identification of an \\"instrument\\" ‚Äì i.e. a variable which correlates with per capita income but not with the error term in the linear regression. However, since any variable which is likely to correlate with income is also likely to correlate strongly with health and life expectancy this is a difficult task. Some research suggests that in low and middle-income countries, the causality does indeed go from income to health, while the opposite is true for rich countries.Erkan Erdil, Hakan Yetkiner, \\"A Panel Data Approach for Income- Health Causality\\" References External links *An image of the Preston curve at ganfyd.org, the free medical knowledge base [no longer valid 2019-09-15] Category:Demographic economics Category:Development economics ","title":"Preston curve"},{"id":"8027429","text":"Hever is a village in Flanders, Belgium.https://www.accuweather.com/en/be/hever/961227/weather-forecast/961227 References Category:Populated places in Flemish Brabant ","title":"Hever, Belgium"},{"id":"8027469","text":"Albaugh in 2009 James F.

Background  Novak wrote a trilogy, of which the last part was Magnum Crimen (the first two parts were the Magnum Tempuspublished as Magnum tempus: ilirizam i katoliƒçko sve≈°tenstvo : ideje i liƒçnosti, 1830-1849 by Novak, Viktor; Nova knjiga, Belgrade, 1987 and the Magnum Sacerdospublished as Josip Juraj Strossmayer: apostol Jugoslovenske misli by Novak, Viktor; Savez sokola kraljevine Jugoslavije, Belgrade, 1941). According to O. Neumann, Novak was a Croat by birth, and he has been, since 1924, active among the Serbs. \\"He was Chair of Croatian History, which was founded at the University of Belgrade in order to promote mutual understanding between the two kindred peoples\\". One of the determining factors in his life was his visit to Rome before 1914 and his research in the Vatican Archives. As a medievalist, he came into close contact with problems of modern religious life, and took lively interest in relations between the Vatican and Catholic Croats. Observing the Roman Catholic Church activities in Yugoslavia for more than fifty years, Novak concluded that this Church replaced the idea of service to God with service to the Roman curia, i.e., to the government of the Roman Pontiff in the role of its world leader. As a result of this idea, in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Roman Catholic Church identified Catholicism with Croatian nationhood,Magnum Crimen [1986], page 9: Stadler je istaknuo, da ƒáe hrvatstvo moƒái biti spa≈°eno jedino pod voƒëstvom hvatskoga episkopata. Nadbiskup Stadler odr≈æao je ovaj znameniti govor, koji je toliko puta kasnije citiran i oznaƒçivan kao najmisaoniji i najdalekose≈æniji program, na drugoj sveƒçanoj sjednici, i odu≈°evio je svu prisutnu \\"preuzvi≈°enu, presvijetlu i ostalu visokocijenjenu gospodu\\", kojoj se obraƒáao povi≈°enim tonom, kad god je nagla≈°avao vezu izmeƒëu hrvatstva i katolicizma which Novak argues turned most of its priesthood into ardent Ustashe supporters.Magnum Crimen [1948], pages I-XV Content =First edition [1948]= Viktor Novak was imprisoned in Banjica Concentration Camp in autumn of 1941. In the camp he met refugees from the Independent State of Croatia and heard of the crimes committed by Ustashe and their clerical supporters. After leaving the camp he started to write Magnum Crimen.Richard West: Tito and the Rise and Fall of Yugoslavia, Faber & Faber, Nov 15, 2012, Chapter 6. First Clashes with the Chetniks The book describes the activities of the Roman Catholic clergy in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, including their intention and attempts to become above the state, to control the state and eventually the everyday lives of the common people. It has two distinct parts. The first part consists of 15 chapters, covering Catholic clericalism from the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century in Austria-Hungary, then in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The second part, the last four chapters, covers the rise and fall of the 1941‚Äì45 Independent State of Croatia (NDH), and the active support of provided to it by the Catholic clergy. According to Novak, the main doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was based on the following:Magnum Crimen [1948], pages 158-159 * the clergy shall be paid by the state as state officials; * the state cannot have any control over the Church; * the Church has right to be fully involved in the political life of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia; * the Church doctrine/religious education shall be a part of primary and secondary school curricula; * the Roman Catholic Church curricula in the schools shall be obligatory to all pupils whose at least one parent is a Roman Catholic. * the state should not allow conversion of Christians to non-Christianity nor allow any Catholic to be un-confessional (Constitutional section of the Roman Catholic Church doctrine in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes as of November 1921) Josip Juraj Strossmayer's ideas, of which the most important one was that serving God is equal to serving the people,Magnum Crimen [1948], page XIV created close relations between ethnic Croats and Serbs by introducing the Old Church Slavonic language as the liturgical language of the Catholic church in the BalkansMagnum Crimen [1948], page 257: Uvoƒëenje starog slavenskog jezika u bogoslu≈æenje katoliƒçkih Hrvata Strossmayer je punih pet decenija smatrao kao jedno od sredstava za zbli≈æavanje zapadne s istoƒçnom crkvom. Napori Strossmayera, koje je on uƒçinio za te ideale u Rimu, Petrogradu, Beogradu i na Cetinju, ogromnih su razmjera. and were aggressively suppressed by the Catholic clergy in Croatia and Slovenia. Ante Paveliƒá's nationalism identified Catholicism with the Croat people, which was actively supported and interpreted by the clergy.Magnum Crimen [1948], page 9 Dr. Ivan ≈†ariƒá: Mi smo Hrvati i katolici i to hoƒáemo da budemo. Zato se sastadosmo da pred cijelim svijetom izjavimo, od kojega nam mnogi ne daju, da se zovemo Hrvati, a drugi nam hoƒáe da krate da smo katolici.Jozo Tomasevich: War and Revolution in Yugoslavia: 1941 - 1945, Stanford University Press page 549 \\"In contrast, Novak lists hundreds of Catholic priests who supported and worked with Ustashas.\\" The second part of this book focuses on the establishment of the 1941‚Äì45 Independent State of Croatia (NDH), the active support extended to the state by the Catholic clergy, and the clergy's involvement and support in the extermination and/or forceful conversion of the Orthodox Serbs as well as the extermination of the Jews and the Roma people. Novak bases his gloomy picture of the NDH and the wartime not only on written documents which, despite strict police measures found their way to the occupied capital, but also on personal narratives by some of his fellow prisoners in the Banjica konclogor. Archbishop Aloysius Stepinac is portrayed in this book as an ardent Catholic crusaderRichard West: Tito and the Rise and Fall of Yugoslavia, Faber & Faber, Nov 15, 2012 Chapter Notes who publicly endorsed the establishment of the NDH,Magnum Crimen [1948], page 551: Stepinac in his speech (complete - on pages 150-151) on April 10, 1941.

Hory and Martin Broszat wrote that the second part of this book, about the Independent State of Croatia crimes, was based on the Yugoslav state commission whose role was to investigate the crimes of the occupying powers and their Ustashe accomplices in World War II and the Croatian Catholic Church press.Ladislaus Hory, Martin Broszat: Der kroatische Ustascha-Staat 1941-1945, Walter de Gruyter, Jan 1, 1964 page 10 see here =English language edition [2011]= This edition, except from being an English language translation of the 1948 edition, contains two new chapters - XIV. Ecclesia militants at war with the ideology of Tyr≈°, and XV. Libellus accusations, both omitted in the original version under the pressure of Josip Broz Tito's OZNA chief Maks Baƒáe. Chapter XIV is about the Sokol (Falcon) Society, founded in Prague in 1862 by Jind≈ôich F√ºgner and Miroslav Tyr≈°. The goal of the Sokol Society was to revive and enhance the national awareness and promote mental and physical health of the Czech people through sports and moral education. The idea soon gained a pan-Slavic character, and Sokol organizations were later established in Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Poland, and Russia. The Sokol movement had full support from Strossmayer, then Bishop of ƒêakovo. After the dissolution of Austria-Hungary and the establishment of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes in 1918, and under the leadership of Lazar Car, Croatian Sokol societies were united with Serbian and Slovenian Sokol clubs into a large Sokol Alliance on 15 June 1919. The separatism-prone Croatian clergy forced Croatian Sokols to leave the Yugoslav Sokol Alliance in 1919‚Äì20, fueling internal conflicts within the Alliance on political grounds. At the same time, high Catholic clergy established the Orlovi (Eagles) clerical organization with the aim of taking youths away from the Alliance. The Croatian Catholic Church rejected the pan-Slavic idea of bringing together Catholic, Orthodox, and Muslim believers under the motto that \\"a brother is dear regardless of his faith\\". The two Catholic organizations, Orlovi (Eagles) and Katoliƒçka Akcija (Catholic Action) were a main base of this resistance to the idea of Yugoslavism, brotherhood and religious tolerance. The Catholic Church's resistance to this idea of pan- Slavism led the Polish Sokols to abstain from the international All Sokol Rally held in Prague in 1926. Chapter XV, titled Libellus Accusations, is about a few Croatian clergymen who were followers of Strossmayer's idea (namely, that to serve people means to serve God). The most prominent among them was Frano Ivani≈°eviƒá, a national fighter and promoter of Old Slavonic Church language as the language of liturgy in the Croatian Catholic Church. He demonstrated that a Catholic priest serving his people would not be against his Church and faith.Magnum Crimen Two omitted chapters from the book Reception The earliest international surveys of the book are the ones written by Russian S. Troicky (1949) and the Swede Oscar Neumann (1950). Neumann stressed three things particular to this book: the role of Novak in spreading and defending the idea of Yugoslavism, the abundance of documents used to support the book content, and the imbalance in tone, stating that \\"Some passages have been written by a scholar in a dignified academic gown, in other parts of the book the author assumes the role of public prosecutor.\\" The abridged edition of this book published in 1960 in SarajevoVelika optu≈æba (Magnum crimen) by Viktor Novak, Svjetlost Sarajevo 1960 (abridged) was reviewed in the Yugoslav journal of history, Istorijski glasnik, that same year by Yugoslav historian Branko Petranoviƒá,Petranoviƒá, Branko - Viktor Novak: \\" Velika optu≈æba (Magnum Crimen).

As reported by the Serbian daily Politika, the publication of the English language edition was financed by a schoolmate of Milorad Ekmeƒçiƒá, who also wrote the foreword to the edition. According to the same article, the publication of the English translation was coincided with the Croatia's lawsuit against Serbia in front of the International Court of Justice, so that \\"the world would be informed about Ustashe crimes against Serbs during the Second World War\\".

The defense is named for J√°nos Balogh (1892‚Äì1980), who was a Hungarian International Master of correspondence chess, and a strong master at over-the-board chess.

He established one of the first verifiable empires in history: he subdued Elam and destroyed the city of Susa as well as several other Iranian cities, and extended his domain to Sumer and Akkad. One inscription found on a boulder states that Eannatum was his Sumerian name, while his \\"Tidnu\\" (Amorite) name was Lumma. Conquest of Sumer Eannatum, grandson of Ur-Nanshe and son of Akurgal, was a king of Lagash who conquered all of Sumer, including Ur, Nippur, Akshak (controlled by Zuzu), Larsa, and Uruk (controlled by Enshakushanna, who is on the King List). He entered into conflict with Umma, waging a war over the fertile plain of Gu-Edin. He personally commanded an army to subjugate the city-state, and vanquished Ush, the ruler of Umma, finally making a boundary treaty with Enakalle, successor of Ush, as described in the Stele of the Vultures and in the Cone of Entemena: Eannatum made Umma a tributary, where every person had to pay a certain amount of grain into the treasury of the goddess Nina and the god Ingurisa. Conquest outside Sumer Eannatum of Lagash in full dress, reconstitution. Eannatum expanded his influence beyond the boundaries of Sumer. He conquered parts of Elam, including the city Az off the coast of the modern Persian Gulf, allegedly smote Shubur, and, having repulsed Akshak, he claimed the title of \\"King of Kish\\" (which regained its independence after his death) and demanded tribute as far as Mari: Eannatum recorded his victories on a stone inscription: However, revolts often arose in parts of his empire. During Eannatum‚Äôs reign, many temples and palaces were built, especially in Lagash. The city of Nina, probably a precursor of Niniveh, was rebuilt, with many canals and reservoirs being excavated. Stele of the Vultures A fragment of the Stele of the Vultures showing vultures with severed human heads in their beaks and a fragment of cuneiform script. The so-called Stele of the Vultures, now in the Louvre, is a fragmented limestone stele found in Telloh, (ancient Girsu) Iraq, in 1881. The stele is reconstructed as having been high and wide and was set up ca. 2500‚Äì2400 BCE. It was erected as a monument of the victory of Eannatum of Lagash over Ush, king of Umma, leading to a boundary treaty with his successor Enakalle of Umma. On it various incidents in the war are represented. In one register, the king (his name appears inscribed around his head) stands in front of his phalanx of heavily armoured soldiers, with a curved weapon in his right hand, formed of three bars of metal bound together by rings. In another register a figure, the king, his name again inscribed around his head, rides on his chariot in the thick of the battle, while his kilted followers, with helmets on their heads and lances in their hands, march behind him. On the other side of the stele is an image of Ninurta, a god of war, holding the captive Ummaites in a large net. This implies that Eannatum attributed his victory to Ninurta, and thus that he was in the god's protection (though some accounts say that he attributed his victory to Enlil, the patron deity of Lagash). The victory of Eannatum is mentioned in a fragmentary inscription on the stele, suggesting that after the loss of 3,600 soldiers on the field, Ush, king of Umma, was killed in a rebellion in his capital city of Umma: ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] (Eanatum) defeated him. Its ( = Umma‚Äôs) 3600 corpses reached the base of heaven [...] raised (their) hands against him and killed him in Umma.‚Äù. File:Stele of the vultures (war).jpgEannatum leading his troops in battle.

She was long, and her original capacity in 1925 was 95 cars and approximately 800 passengers. By 1960, cars had become much bigger and her capacity was reduced to 32 modern automobiles and 325 passengers. A 600-horsepower Estep diesel engine allowed her to sail at when originally built. Almost every part of her was from Washington state; her hull and superstructure were built from Washington-grown fir, and her Estep engine was built in at Washington Iron Works in Tacoma. She was owned originally by the Kitsap County Transportation Company (KCTC), and was the first in a series of ferries (the others being the and ) that provided some serious competition to the Puget Sound Navigation Company (PSN), which was the other dominant ferry operator on Puget Sound. She first entered service on the Fauntleroy-Vashon route and sailed there until 1930 when she was moved over to the Suquamish-Ballard route. A strike in 1935 resulted in KCTC being acquired by PSN, making PSN the sole ferry operator on Puget Sound. PSN kept her on the Suquamish-Ballard route until 1938, when they moved her to the Mukilteo- Clinton ferry route. In 1940, she was on the Port Townsend-Keystone ferry route but returned to Mukilteo-Clinton a year later, where she remained until World War II ended. She was assigned to the Point Defiance-Tahlequah run from 1947 to 1949. In 1951, almost all of PSN's ferries and routes were acquired by Washington State Ferries (WSF), including the ferry Kitsap. She was assigned to the Lofall-South Point route across Hood Canal, where she supplemented the newer . The Hood Canal Bridge opened in 1961, and WSF no longer needed the Kitsap. In 1961, she was sold to the Oregon Department of Transportation for use on the Astoria‚ÄìMegler ferry route across the Columbia River. In 1966, the Astoria‚ÄìMegler Bridge opened, putting the Kitsap and other ferries that served the route out of service. Kitsap was sold to a private party to be used as a fish cannery. She sank while being towed to Alaska on 3 November 1966. A new, much larger ferry with the same name was built in 1980, and is still in service on Puget Sound.

Malta was an active British base strategically located near supply routes from Europe to North Africa. Axis supply convoys across the Mediterranean Sea suffered severe losses, which in turn threatened the fighting ability of the Axis armies in North Africa. The Allies were able to keep their North African armies supplied. The Kriegsmarine tried to isolate Malta but later it concentrated its U-boat operations on disrupting Allied landing operations in southern Europe. Some 60 German U-boats made the hazardous passage into the Mediterranean Sea from 1941. Only one completed the journey both ways.Paterson, Lawrence - U-Boats in the Mediterranean 1941‚Äì1944, 2007, Chatham, , pp. 19 and 182.http://uboat.net/boats/u26htm Karl D√∂nitz, the Commander-in-Chief, U-boats, Befehlshaber der Unterseeboote (BdU) was always reluctant to send his boats into the Mittelmeer but he recognised that natural bottlenecks such as the Straits of Gibraltar were more likely to result in shipping being found and attacked than relying on finding it in the vast Atlantic Ocean. The U-boats were sent to assist the Italians, although many were attacked in the Strait of Gibraltar and nine were sunk while attempting the passage and ten more were damaged. The Mediterranean is a clear and calm body of water which made escape more difficult for the U-boats.Paterson, 11th photo caption, between pages 74 and 75 The Axis failed in their objective. Prior Experience The Kriegsmarine had acquired some knowledge of the area; D√∂nitz was an officer aboard UB-68 which had been sunk in the region in World War I.Paterson, p. 6 U-boats had also served in the Spanish Civil War. The Republicans, with twelve submarines, opposed the Nationalists, who had none; the presence of German U-boats was most welcome. The first two vessels, U-33 and U-34, under the codename Training Exercise Ursula, left Wilhelmshaven on 20 November 1936. Both submarines sailed down the English Channel and slipped into the Mediterranean on the night of 27 November. They were soon in action, U-34 fired a single torpedo at a Republican destroyer in the evening of 1 December. The projectile missed, impacting on rocks. The boat, under Leutnant zur See Harald Grosse, tried again on 5 and 8 December, with an equal lack of success. U-33 fared no better; her commander was frustrated by the absence of target identification or defensive movement of his intended victims. Only one vessel was sunk by the U-boats, the Republican submarine C-3, which was attacked by U-34 on 12 December. The early years By October 1939, D√∂nitz had decided to use three longer-range boats to intercept the first Allied convoys of the war. , and were to rendezvous southwest of Ireland before attempting to force the Straits and attack the convoys in the Mediterranean. Things went quickly wrong, U-25 was diverted to a convoy south-west of Lisbon. After an abortive torpedo attack on a steamer on 31 October, Viktor Sch√ºtze, U-25s commander, surfaced and proceeded to sink his target with fire from his deck gun. This course of action caused a crack in a vital part of the submarine, obliging the boat to return to Germany. U-53 ran low on fuel after shadowing a convoy in the Bay of Biscay and was also forced to return. U-26, was compelled by a combination of unsuitable weather, searchlights and British anti-submarine patrols, to abandon an attempt to lay mines near Gibraltar harbour. The boat sailed through the Straits on the surface and claimed but a solitary ship sunk in the Mediterranean. This 'sinking' was not confirmed by post-war analysis. U-26 headed back through the Straits, arriving in Wilhelshaven on 5 December 1939; the only U-boat to enter and leave the Mediterranean in the war.Paterson, pp. 19, 182. This mission was summed-up in the BdU Kriegstagebuch (KTB) War Diary, > It was a mistake to send U-25, U-26 and U-53 into the Mediterranean. U-25 > had to return before she ever got there, U-53 did not get through and U-26 > hardly encountered any shipping worth mentioning. This patrol shows all the > disadvantages of a long outward passage.KTBPaterson, p. 20 Many attacks mentioned were gun actions or ramming, particularly at the eastern end of the Mediterranean. This was because the potential target was \\"unworthy or [a] difficult torpedo target\\".Paterson, 23rd photo caption between pages 74 and 75 Afrika Korps The 23rd U-boat Flotilla was established in September 1941 to intercept coastal shipping supplying Allied forces in the Siege of Tobruk. U-boats patrolled the eastern Mediterranean from the 23rd flotilla base on Salamis Island in Greece. On 7 December, control of the 23rd Flotilla was transferred from Kern√©vel to The Commander in Chief in the South (Oberbefehlshaber S√ºd, OB S√ºd) Albert Kesselring. Additional bases were established in Pula in Croatia and La Spezia in northern Italy as more U-boats were ordered to the Mediterranean, until focus shifted to the western Atlantic through the Second Happy Time.Blair(1996)pp.395-404 * passed Gibraltar on 21 September 1941.Blair(1996)pp.735‚Äì736 * passed Gibraltar on 26 September 1941, and sank on 27 November, the 3,059-ton Shuntien of convoy TA 5 on 23 December, and the 2,487-ton Warszawa of convoy AT 6 on 26 December. * passed Gibraltar on 27 September 1941, sank the 1,208-ton Samos and the 758-ton Pass of Balmaha on 17 October. * passed Gibraltar on 30 September, destroyed a 372-ton British landing craft on 10 October, and sank on 25 November 1941.Blair(1996)pp.399&736 * passed Gibraltar on 3 October, sank two 372-ton British landing craft on 12 October, and sank the 1,587-ton Volo of convoy ME 8 before being sunk by convoy escort on 28 December 1941.Blair(1996)pp.403&735-736 * passed Gibraltar on 5 October, damaged on 21 October, and was sunk on 23 December 1941 by Royal Navy destroyers. * passed Gibraltar on 11 November 1941. * passed Gibraltar on 12 November and sank on 13 November 1941.Blair(1996)pp.396-397&736 * was sunk near Gibraltar on 16 November 1941 by . * passed Gibraltar on 16 November 1941. * passed Gibraltar on 24 November 1941 and damaged the 3,560-ton Myriel on 13 December. * passed Gibraltar on 26 November, sank the 4,032-ton Fjord on 2 December, then sank on 15 December, and was sunk on 16 December 1941 by the .Blair(1996)pp.400&736 * passed Gibraltar on 27 November 1941 and sank the 4,274-ton Grelhead on 2 December. * was torpedoed by the Dutch submarine O 21 while passing Gibraltar on 28 November 1941. * passed Gibraltar on 29 November 1941, sank the 1,595-ton Saint Denis on 9 December, and sank the 6,557-ton Varlaam Avanesov on 19 December. * passed Gibraltar on 8 December 1941. * passed Gibraltar on 9 December 1941. * passed Gibraltar on 9 December 1941 and sank the Spanish ship Badalona on 13 December. * sank the trawler HMS Lady Shirley and the patrol yacht HMS Rosabelle while passing Gibraltar on 10 December 1941Blair(1996)pp.403&716-719 and was torpedoed by on 12 January 1942.Taylor(1966)p.124 * passed Gibraltar on 10 December 1941 and sank on 24 December * passed Gibraltar on 15 December 1941. * passed Gibraltar on 16 December 1941 and damaged on 12 January 1942. * passed Gibraltar on 18 December 1941. * passed Gibraltar on 18 December 1941 and sank the 5,289-ton Hellen on 21 December. * was sunk by Fairey Swordfish from 812 Naval Air Squadron while passing Gibraltar on 21 December 1941. * passed Gibraltar on 21 December 1941. * passed Gibraltar on 23 December 1941 and was sunk by aircraft on 9 January 1942. * passed Gibraltar on 14 January. * passed Gibraltar on 15 January 1942 Second Happy Time La Spezia became headquarters when the Mediterranean U-boats were reorganized as the 29th U-boat Flotilla in May 1942. No more U-boats were assigned to the Mediterranean from mid-January to early October 1942 as opportunities along the east coast of North America seemed more productive while the Afrika Korps was successfully advancing on Egypt. The 29th flotilla focused on convoys supplying Malta and British forces on the Egyptian coast. For sustained operations, U-boats spent approximately one-third of the time on patrol stations, one-third in transit to and from base for routine provisioning and refueling, and one-third undergoing major overhaul or battle repair. 29th flotilla target strength of twenty U-boats enabled a routine patrol strength of three U-boats from Salamis in the eastern Mediterranean, and three from La Spezia in the western Mediterranean.

It is near the mouth of the River Delvin and the northern border of County Dublin. History =Archaeology= A group of passage graves on either side of the mouth of river Delvin, known as the Bremore/Gormanston group, is believed to mark the arrival of that culture from the Iberian peninsula and to be the precursor of later developments such as the Newgrange cluster. Legend also associates the site with the first landings of both Saint Patrick and Oliver Cromwell. During construction of a gas pipeline between Great Britain and Ireland, a 7 metre long prehistoric dugout was found just offshore at Gormanston Strand.https://archive.is/20130116073222/http://www.adco-ie.com/projects/uw- excavation.html Unlike other ancient Irish boats, the Gormanston boat seems to have been of outrigger construction. =Historic features= The Cock public house Several ancient cob cottages still exist in the village under more modern surfaces. Gormanston Bridge dates to the 13th century and is believed to be one of the oldest structures on the Dublin-Dunleer turnpike. St Brigid's Well in Tobersool is an ancient holy well reputedly associated with a cure for diseases of the eye. In 1870, the first authentic game of polo in Ireland was played on Gormanston Strand involving the 9th Lancers, who were at the time quartered in the country. =Gormanston Castle and the Prestons= Gormanston Castle Gormanston Castle was, from the 14th century to the 1950s, the seat of the Preston family, who managed to hold on to their estate lands through the centuries despite being staunch Catholics. The head of the family is known as Viscount Gormanston, premier Viscount of Ireland. The current holder of the title is The 17th Viscount Gormanston, who resides in London. Elizabeth Gorman, painter, lived here. The family sold the castle in the 1950s, when it was acquired by the Franciscan Order of Friars who then established a boarding school for boys in the grounds, known as Gormanston College.Gormanstown Castle downloaded April 2010 Since 2015, the school has been managed by Meath VEC under Franciscan trusteeship and is now largely a day school although there are still 70 boarders. The sports facilities and vacation accommodation for groups is separately managed by a new company Gormanston Park.http://www.gormanstonpark.ie According to The New Ireland Review, April 1908, legend holds that when the head of the family is in his final hours, the foxes of County Meath, except for nursing vixens, emerge from their earths and make their way to the door of Gormanston Castle to keep vigil until he has died, in thanksgiving for the deliverance and protection from marauding predators of a vixen and her young by a previous Lord Gormanston.

McKusick was born in Medford, Massachusetts. In the early 1950s he worked with Terry Gibbs and Don Elliott. McKusick also released albums under his own leadership, including a 1957 album for Prestige titled Triple Exposure. At that time he made many recordings with groups led by George Russell and Jimmy Giuffre. A fine example of his solo playing can be heard on All About Rosie, the lead track on the suite for orchestra featuring Bill Evans (written by George Russell and conducted by Gunther Schuller), recorded live at the Brandeis Jazz Festival in 1957. In 1958 Hal McKusick led a small group with Bill Evans that recorded Cross Section - Saxes which included contributions from Art Farmer, Paul Chambers, Connie Kay, and Barry Galbraith. For this album, McKusick commissioned arrangements from George Handy, Jimmy Giuffre, George Russell and Ernie Wilkins. He also worked on sessions with other prominent jazz musicians including Lee Konitz and John Coltrane. In 1960, he starred in the Edward Albee one-act play The Sandbox.

It is run by the Missionary Sisters Servants of the Holy Spirit (SSpS) congregation, or Holy Spirit Sisters. It has preparatory, elementary and high school departments, and in-line with the K to 12 program of the government. The high school department was originally exclusive for girls, but has been changed to co-ed since 2001. In 2013, construction began for a new school campus at Purok 3, Dao District, Tagbilaran City, Bohol. Classes at the new campus commenced on November 5, 2015. The school, being run by the S.Sp.S. sisters, has a deeply rooted spirituality on the Holy Trinity and the Word of God, as imbibed by Saint Arnold Janssen as the founder of the congregation. She is also affiliated with the other congregations founded by Saint Arnold Janssen, namely the Society of the Divine Word (Societas Verbi Divini, abbreviated SVD), and the Missionary Sisters Servants of the Holy Spirit of Perpetual Adoration (SSpSAP). The Holy Trinity Academy in Loay, Bohol, is her sister school, being run also by the S.Sp.S. sisters.  History  = Early History = The late Msgr. Gelacio T. Ramirez, a diocesan priest, founded the school in 1926. The school began as a dormitory for girls studying at the Bohol National High School. Msgr. Ramirez, the Vicar General of the Diocese of Tagbilaran then, requested for the Missionary Sisters Servants of the Holy Spirit to work in the parish. As a response to this request, the first three S.Sp.S. sisters: Sr. Laeticia, Sr. Blasia, and Sr. Josaphata, arrived in Tagbilaran on the feast of Nuestra Se√±ora del Pilar, on October 16, 1926. Father Ramirez then helped the three pioneer sisters open a Kindergarten with nineteen (19) enrollees on November 1 that year. Elementary levels then opened, which was later followed by the high school levels. The school was named St. Joseph's Academy in honor of the Patron of Tagbilaran. The school year began in 1927-1928, with a total of forty-nine (49) pupils. In the following year, the number of enrollees reached more than two hundred (200) pupils from Kindergarten to Grade Seven and First Year high school. Enrollees consistently increased each year until the outbreak of the war, where enrollment reached five-hundred sixty-six (566). The war caused classes to be temporarily suspended. Classes were resumed on June 4, 1945. = Post World War II = St. Joseph's Academy took big strides in development after the war. The Bureau of Private Schools permitted the school to offer a two-year course leading to the title of Elementary Teacher's Certificate (E.T.C.). The school's name was also changed from St. Joseph's Academy to St. Joseph's Junior College. In the early fifties, the college began offering courses in Music, Education, and Liberal Arts. Later on, the school's facade got a new look, with a sign \\"St. Joseph's College\\", and later on, \\"College of the Holy Spirit\\". The old building (Saint Arnold Janssen Building), could no longer cope with the yearly increase in enrollment. Another building was planned to be built, now called the Blessed Maria Helena Building, in honor of Blessed Maria Helena Stollenwerk. Efforts for the building's construction was spearheaded by Sister Doloresmaria, S.Sp.S., the Superior/Directress of the school. The completed building was then inaugurated by the Most. Rev. Manuel Mascari√±as on December 5, 1965. = 1970s = The college department was phased out in 1974. In the next school year, the school was renamed Holy Spirit School of Tagbilaran. The school celebrated its Golden Jubilee in October 1976. = 1990s = Holy Spirit school continually updated its offerings (curricular, co-curricular and extra-curricular), made use of innovative strategies, improved her facilities, and updated school policies. The school was able to offer quality education, manifested by the passing the preliminary PAASCU (Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities) Self Survey in 1985, Formal Survey in 1988, and the Resurvey for two terms in 1991 and 1996. The school takes pride in being the first and only PAASCU accredited school in the province for the past two decades. In 1998, the S.Sp.S. congregation ventured to realize the HSS expansion project, with the cooperation of the members of the HSS community (Alumni/Alumnae, the Federated Parents-Teachers Association (FPTA), and other benefactors). This led to the construction of the Mother Josepha Building, named in honor of Mother Josepha (Hendrina Stenmanns), that now stands along Remolador Street. = 2000s = The school celebrated its Diamond Jubilee in July 2001, which served as a homecoming for all who have once been seeds sown in her fertile ground, and now have taken their places in the fast-changing society. In the same year, the school opened its doors to male high school enrollees, as a realization of her vision for a gender-fair education. On July 26, 2006, the Holy Spirit School Alumni Association had a Grand Alumni Homecoming, in time for the Bohol Sandugo Festival activities, and the Tigum Bol-anon Tibuok Kalibutan or TBTK. In October 2006, the Holy Spirit School celebrated its 80th founding anniversary in Bohol. The school community also celebrated the canonization of Saint Arnold Janssen and Saint Joseph Freinademetz on October 5, 2003. Saint Arnold Janssen was the founder of the S.Sp.S. congregation, and Saint Joseph Freinademetz was one of the first missionary SVD priests sent to China. The year two thousand and thirteen saw the school undergo a shake-up. She relocated its campus to Dao District, Tagbilaran City. Along with this move, were some administrative shake-up, hence the creation of a new logo, as well as curriculum updates in line with the implementation of the K to 12 program by the Department of Education. As of 2017, construction of the other facilities is still on-going at the new campus. HSS lives on to her motto: Truth in Love where each one acknowledges himself/herself to be loved by the Father, sent by the Son and empowered by the Holy Spirit. Grateful for and dependent on God's grace for her existence, she continues to stand today, a school committed to the education of the Christian Filipino who is willing to meet the cultural and practical demands of her/his age...a school where a genuine Catholic atmosphere permeates through BEC and gender-fair way of life, where Truth in Love touches every person, every relationship, every learning experience.  Academic Programs  The school's curriculum is aligned with the government's thrust of promoting the K to 12 education, where schools in the Philippines now offer 13 years of basic education. The Department of Education then granted the school government recognition for preschool, elementary, and secondary levels in 2013. On top of the government recognition, the school is also privately accredited by the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities, or PAASCU. At present, the school has a Level II accreditation for Basic Education (integrated High School and Grade School units) HSS currently offers basic education in Preschool (Nursery, Kinder, Preparatory levels), Elementary/Grade School (Grade 1 to 6), and High School (Junior high school: Grade 7 to 10; Senior high school: Grade 11 to 12). There are three available program offerings (also known as \\"tracks\\") for senior high school students: Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), Accountancy, Business and Management (ABM), and Humanities and Social Sciences (HUMMS).  Student Life  = Activities and Traditions = * Feast Days ** Every grade/year level has their patron saint. On the patron's feast day, students of the year level celebrate by holding a Holy Mass, and activities such as film showing and outreach to communities. ** The school also celebrates Feast Days of the S.Sp.S. founder Arnold Janssen, as well as the S.Sp.S. sisters Helena Stollenwerk and Hendrina Stenmanns. *Pilgrimage ** Students from various grade levels hold a pilgrimage annually during the last week of October, as culmination of the Rosary Month. The students walk while praying the rosary from the school campus to the Church of Our Lady of the Assumption in Dauis, Bohol. * HSS Day ** This one day annual event commemorates the school's existence. Students and pupils prepare for various activities such as the field demonstration where every year level has their own dance, talent showcase, and more. * Camping ** Grade 6, and Grade 12 students hold a camping activity, to be able to apply their learnings and skills in scouting. * Annual Intramurals * Month-long celebrations or themes ** The school observes different monthly celebrations and themes, such as Nutrition Month (July), English and Book Month (November), and Rosary Month (October). * Holy Masses ** The school holds Holy Mass for Feast Days, First Fridays, First Holy Communion, Class Masses, and other significant events. * Recollection/Retreat for graduating students * Fun-Filled Summer ** Launched in the summer break of 2009, the school offers different summer classes to interested students.

It is south-east of the Brisbane central business district. At the 2016 Australian Census the suburb recorded a population of 3,175. The suburb's western boundary is partially aligned with the Gateway Motorway and Bulimba Creek.  History  During convict settlement, explorers passed through the region but it was not until 1865 that the first settlers started farming the area's rich alluvial soil. The area takes its name from the Roche family, who emigrated from Ireland to Australia in 1860 and settled in the region. The family built a homestead they called Rochedale in 1868. During the 1960s residential development took off in the area. One local builder, Jack Davey was responsible for some of the new estates off Rochedale Road between Underwood Road and Priestdale Road. Some of the street names are family names such as Rhonda Street and Davey Street. The family lived in the area until the mid 1990s. The suburb of Rochedale is supported by many community organisations including sporting clubs, religious entities, youth organisations and educational groups. In 1956, the Rochedale Scout Group was formed and established a Scout Den on the corner of Grieve and Rochedale Roads. This parcel of land was zoned for recreational use by the Queensland Government. In 1981, the Redeemer Lutheran College was established. The Rochedale dump began operations in 1991. A waste-to-energy facility has been generating electricity since 2004.  Development  Rochedale State School was established at the intersection of Miles Platting Road and Rochedale Road in 1931. In previous elections, the controversy on whether a dump should be built in Rochedale or not featured heavily in some candidates' campaigns. From 2009, Rochedale is expected to experience major growth from 1,200 residents to over 17,000 over the course of 15‚Äì20 years.http://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/bccwr/lib174/miles_platting_road_intersection_newsletter_july08.pdf This is due to 'The Rochedale Urban Community Development' where bush and farm lands have been approved by the Brisbane City Council to be turned into housing estates. As Rochedale backs onto the Priest Gully a wildlife corridor has been set up to preserve the local flora and fauna. Demographics In the , the population of Rochedale was 1,092, 49.5% female and 50.5% male. The median age of the Rochedale population was 43 years, 6 years above the Australian median. 64.9% of people living in Rochedale were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 69.8%; the next most common countries of birth were Taiwan 3.8%, England 3.7%, New Zealand 3.5%, Italy 1.2%, United States of America 1.2%. 72.4% of people spoke only English at home; the next most common languages were 4.2% Mandarin, 1.6% Italian, 1.6% Greek, 1.5% Cantonese, 1% Punjabi.

Peabody in 1898.Stein, Alan J. (2001). Safe Passage The Birth of Washington State Ferries Seattle: Sodexho-Marriott Corp. ., p. 9 It operated a fleet of steamboats and ferries on Puget Sound in Washington and the Georgia Strait in British Columbia. Known colloquially as the Black Ball Line, the PSNC achieved a \\"virtual monopoly\\" on cross-sound traffic in the 1930s and competed with the Canadian Pacific Railway's steamships on several routes. History Before 1927, when the company was controlled by Joshua Green, the house flag consisted of a design by Mrs. Green, a red star on a white diamond on a blue background. After 1927, when Joshua Green sold his interest to the Peabody family, the Black Ball company flag was transferred over to Puget Sound Navigation Co., and the company became known as the Black Ball Line.Newell, Gordon R., ed., H.W. McCurdy Marine History of the Pacific Northwest, at 87, n.2, Superior Publishing, Seattle, WA 1966 The new Black Ball flag PSNC began to struggle following World War II, as operating costs increased and its unions threatened strike action. PSNC petitioned the State Utilities Commission for permission to raise its fares, but was rebuffed. Following a long series of court battles, PSNC's unionized employees finally called a strike. The company responded not by hiring strike breakers, but by halting operations, hoping public pressure would convince the State to permit a fare increase. The State declined to intervene, and PSNC eventually sold its domestic operations assets to the state of Washington's Department of Transportation for the sum of $4.9 million in early 1951, creating Washington State Ferries on May 31. PSNC retained the assets used in their Canadian operations and, after the 1951 downsizing, operated a much-reduced fleet of five ships as Black Ball Ferries, Ltd. on routes between Vancouver and Nanaimo, and across Howe Sound and Jervis Inlet. The first all-Canadian route began on August 11, 1951 and was between Horseshoe Bay (in West Vancouver) and Gibsons Landing on BC's Sunshine Coast. In November 1961, this company sold most of its assets to BC Ferries, which had commenced operations in June 1960 as a division of the British Columbia Toll Highways and Bridges Authority, a Crown corporation of the British Columbia provincial government. The current descendant of the Black Ball Line is Black Ball Ferry Line, which currently operates only one route across the Strait of Juan de Fuca, between Port Angeles and Victoria, using the MV Coho. Originally Black Ball Line had a second service known as Black Ball Freight Service which was a subsidiary of the Puget Sound Navigation. It is unclear when the subsidiary was created. In 1936 R.J. Acheson purchased the subsidiary. In 1952, Acheson and his wife organized a new subsidiary of Black Ball Freight Service, naming it Black Ball Transport, Inc. By 2008 Black Ball Transport was renamed to its current name. Black Ball Freight Service ended in 2008.

This episode is also known as \\"Radio 2\\" and \\"The Beauty Contest\\" as well as \\"Housewives\\" and \\"Miss Housewife\\". Written by The Goodies, with songs and music by Bill Oddie. Plot Graeme and Bill return from their fishing trip to discover that the office wasn't completely clean and Tim has become obese through eating huge amounts of lard. Tim has also taken to listening to a radio show which it turns out, that it is also listened to by a lot of housewives (all of whom have also become obese), and this leads the group (Tim included) to a health club, where they slim down again. Meanwhile, Bill and Graeme are cleaning the office themselves, before Tim comes back from the health club. They find that Tim is slim again with a feminine look. Tim continues listening to the radio and the disc jockey announces a Beauty pageant for housewives, called Miss Housewife of the Year, on Friday night at the Royal Albert Hall. Tim enters the contest, but Graeme forbids him to go to the pageant because he's not a housewife - not even a miss - but it was no use. Tim walks off to make himself pretty for the pageant because he won't listen to his friends. When Graeme telephones the radio station, the disc jockey says \\"Hello Darling?\\" Graeme answers back \\"Don't you Darling me Mate!\\" and makes the disc jockey accidentally admit why he doesn't want any fat women in the pageant and saying selfish cruel remarks, leading to the disc jockey getting fired for his comments. When the BBC makes an announcement for hiring a new disc jockey to take the previous disc jockey's place, Graeme has an idea to change the Beauty Pageant and takes the job. Graeme becomes a disc jockey and does all the voices of other disc jockeys. Bill tries to convince Tim that Graeme is on the radio and believes he's gone mad with power. Then, Bill hears about the prize money. Graeme makes further instructions to the housewives which make them fat again (Tim wants to also join in, but is prevented from doing so by Bill). On Friday night at the Albert Hall, the beauty contest has started with Graeme welcoming all the obese housewives. The milkmen judges and other men are not impressed with them. Then Tim (Ms. Cricklewood), who has stayed slim, becomes the winner of Miss Housewife of the Year. Tim and Bill are happy to win the contest but Graeme is displeased with Bill's misunderstanding of his plan. The housewives become angry with the Goodies and chase them to get the prize cup. By the time the trio gets exhausted from running, they notice that the housewives have lost all their fat and become slim again while on the run, so the Goodies blow the dresses off the housewives (leaving them dressed in their underwear). Then the tune for The Benny Hill Show is heard as the Goodies chase all the housewives around the park.

It is located in the City of Charles Sturt. History The area incorporating the current suburb of Ridleyton was originally granted to Osmond Gilles in March 1839. He later transferred it to John Ridley, inventor of the stripper or reaping machine, in June 1842 for ¬£275. In 1873, Ridley lodged a plan to subdivide his land, naming one part Ridleyton. Geography Ridleyton is primarily bounded by South Road, Torrens Road, Wood Avenue and Blight Street. The suburb includes the northwestern end of the redeveloped Hawker Street precinct. Demographics The 2016 Census by the Australian Bureau of Statistics counted 1,128 persons in Ridleyton on census night. Of these, 47.7% were male and 52.3% were female.

After taking 26 wickets for sixteen runs each in 1958,Preston, Norman (editor); Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, Ninety-Sixth Edition (1959); pp. 683-684 Jackson declined somewhat on the less favourable pitches of 1959Preston, Norman (editor); Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, Ninety-Seventh Edition (1960); pp. 698-699 and 1960,Preston, Norman (editor); Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, Ninety-Eighth Edition (1961); pp. 700-701 but with Cheshire unable to afford any professionals, Brian Jackson was signed by Derbyshire for 1961. He debuted for the Derbyshire Second XI in the 1961 season in an innings-victory against Nottinghamshire in Epperstone. After playing in the Second XI for two years, Brian Jackson made his first-class debut in the 1963 season against Somerset in May, though he was absent hurt in the match. He saw action in his next game, against Glamorgan, and was a regular member of the side for the rest of the season. He bowled steadily, and in one match against Pakistan Eaglets he took ten wickets for ninety runs.Derbyshire v Pakistan Eaglets in 1963 He received his Derbyshire cap and with his unrelated namesake Leslie Jackson retiring was viewed as a future spearhead of the Derbyshire bowling. Like Leslie, Brian Jackson was not a strong batsman: he never reached 30 in a first-class innings and his runs exceeded his wickets by no more than 190 for his whole career. In the 1964 season, with 79 Championship wickets Brian Jackson was by far the best bowler in the team and critics were impressed by his workrate although his average of 23.59 suggested Derbyshire was losing its traditional strength in pace bowling.Preston, Norman (editor); Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, One Hundred and Second Edition (1965); p. 350 However, the 1965 season saw Brian Jackson advance remarkably to form with Harold Rhodes an immensely powerful opening attack: the two bowlers were first and second in the national averages. Jackson's superb outswinger and extremely accurate length made him an extremely formidable opponent on the damp pitches of that summer, and he was never mastered even on the better pitches. Although with his weakness as a batsman Brian Jackson had not been considered for the 1965 Tests against New Zealand and South Africa, an immense amount was expected of him even at thirty-three (a time when most pace bowlers begin to decline). In the 1966 season he achieved a few superb performances under helpful conditions, such as eight for 18 in the first innings and twelve for 49 in the match against Warwickshire at Coventry but overall the performance was disappointing in this and the 1967 season. In 1967 Jackson took eleven for 69 against Warwickshire at Edgbaston but was dropped from the Derbyshire eleven late in the season. One match for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1967 was his only first-class match for a team other than Derbyshire. After a poor performance in the 1968 season, Brian Jackson was not re-engaged for 1969, but he did play along with Leslie and Cliff Gladwin in a limited overs match to commemorate the centenary of the Derbyshire county club.Derbyshire v Marylebone Cricket Club in 1970 Jackson returned to Cheshire in the Minor Counties Championship between 1969 and 1970.

McEvoy composed the song \\"Only A Woman's Heart\\", title track of A Woman's Heart, the best-selling Irish album in Irish history. Biography McEvoy's life as a musician began at the age of four when she began playing piano. At the age of eight she took up violin. Upon finishing school she attended Trinity College, Dublin where she studied music by day and worked in pit orchestras and music clubs by night. McEvoy graduated from Trinity with an Honors Degree in music, and spent four months busking in New York City. In 1988, she was accepted into the RT√â National Symphony Orchestra where she spent four years before leaving to concentrate on songwriting. She built up a following in clubs in Dublin with her three piece band, Jim Tate on bass, Noel Eccles on drums, and latterly Bill Shanley on guitar. During a solo date in July 1992, she performed a little-known, self-penned song, \\"Only a Woman's Heart\\". Mary Black, of whose band McEvoy was a member, was in the audience and invited her to add the track to an album of Irish female artists. The album was subsequently titled A Woman's Heart and the track was released as the lead single. A few days before A Woman's Heart was released, Tom Zutaut A & R from Geffen Records, who had previously signed Guns & Roses, M√∂tley Cr√ºe, and Edie Brickell, offered McEvoy a worldwide recording deal after watching her perform at The Baggot Inn in Dublin. The album went on to sell over three-quarters of a million copies in Ireland alone and was (and remains) the biggest selling Irish album of all time. Eleanor McEvoy, her first album, recorded in Windmill Lane Studios, was released in February 1993, and tours in the United States, Asia, and Europe followed. Back on Irish soil, McEvoy was awarded Best New Artist, Best New Performer, and Best Songwriter Awards by the Irish entertainment and music industries. In 2011, Portuguese singer Luis Represas included a version of Go Now from McEvoy's eponymous album on his recording Reserva Especial. As she began writing her second album, Tom Zutaut left Geffen Records, so when Columbia Records U.S. offered McEvoy a new deal, she accepted it and began working on a new, edgier second album, which would eventually be titled What's Following Me? The album was released in 1996. The single \\"Precious Little\\" built to a Top-10 radio hit in the United States, giving McEvoy the exposure she needed for a headline tour of the U.S. She was invited to contribute to a number of movie and TV soundtracks. At home, the success of A Woman's Heart continued to overshadow McEvoy's solo work and fans of the mammoth hit were disappointed with the rock elements of the second album and those that might have identified with her bittersweet lyrics, sensual vocals, and loud guitars turned a blind eye to the album. McEvoy released her third album, Snapshots, in 1999. Her primary goal was to make Snapshots her most song-oriented album to date. Toward that goal, McEvoy hooked up with producer Rupert Hine (who worked with Stevie Nicks, Tina Turner, Suzanne Vega, and Duncan Sheik) and recorded the album at Rupert's \\"Chateau de la Tour de Moulin\\" and then in Metropolis Studios in London. The extensive use of drum loops was a complete change in style from her previous work. The album was greeted by rave reviews on both sides of the Atlantic. \\"... her sophisticated voice and compassionate seasoned lyrics ... make Eleanor McEvoy‚Äôs album a gem....\\" declared The Boston Globe, while The Sunday Times described it as \\"her strongest album to date, with well appointed social comment topics...McEvoy‚Äôs take on matters emotional also hits pay dirt with the likes of the excellent 'Did You Tell Him?'\\" However, Columbia Records had been unprepared for the complete stylistic change and relations between the company and McEvoy became strained. Despite this, a sell-out, 24-date tour of the United States accompanied the release of Snapshots in the summer of 1999, followed by the \\"Snapshots Unplugged\\" tour March‚ÄìApril 2000, which culminated in a performance in Boulder, Colorado accompanied by the E Town Band where she duetted with Richard Thompson. Columbia had bought her first album Eleanor McEvoy from Geffen Records, but had not released it by 2000. Neither What's Following Me? nor Snapshots had enjoyed major chart success, and McEvoy's public perception, particularly in Ireland, was caught in a limbo state between rock and folk, with \\"A Woman‚Äôs Heart\\" and its many incarnations still lurking in the back of the minds of the record-buying public. Increasingly, McEvoy started to work on outside projects. The Bert Jansch tribute album People on the Highway ‚Äì A Bert Jansch Encomium (Market Square Records catalog number MSMCD106, Koch, September 2000) saw a newly recorded version of Jansch's song about Sandy Denny, \\"Where Did My Life Go?\\", recorded by McEvoy especially for the album. Participating artists included Al Stewart, Roy Harper, Bernard Butler, Donovan, and Ralph McTell. McEvoy decided to take the fourth album and head down the independent road. Yola was a turning point in McEvoy's musical direction. Released in 2001, it reflected the acoustic, jazz- influenced style she had developed on stage with Brian Connor. For McEvoy it was a new departure and one that found favour with music media. Irish Music Press described it as .... \\"her finest album\\", \\"a brave rejection of the predictable\\", \\"musically daring....beautifully atmospheric\\". International press lauded it as \\"a back to basics triumph\\", \\"beautifully restrained\\", \\"a classic\\", and \\"McEvoy‚Äôs best release to date\\". Extensive touring throughout the U.S. and the UK followed. In 2002, Yola was named \\"Record of the Year\\" by Hi-Fi+ Magazine. March 2004 saw the release of Early Hours (Market Square MSM51SACD128, distributor RSK/BMG), produced by McEvoy and Brian Connor. The album featured McEvoy on vocals, guitar, and fiddle; Connor on piano, Fender Rhodes, Wurlitzer, Hammond organ, and keyboards; Liam Bradley on kit percussion and backing vocals; Calum McColl on guitars and backing vocals; Nicky Scott on bass; and Lindley Hamilton on trumpets. The style differed from McEvoy's previous work, taking on a jazz/blues feel for many of the songs. Early Hours continued the high-quality audio work that had been established with Yola. This album was the first to use TiMax (unique audio imaging) technology, mixed in 5.1 surround-sound onto multi-channel Super Audio CD (SACD). Early Hours was voted Best Contemporary Album 2004‚Äì2005, by Irish Music Magazine Readers Poll. McEvoy continued to tour with Brian Connor until April 2005. She then began performing solo, accompanying herself on bass guitar, electric guitar, mandolin and violin. Her sixth album, Out There, was recorded in The Grange Studio in Norfolk and released in early 2007. It was self-penned, self-produced and featured McEvoy all of the instruments with the exception of a guitar part on \\"Quote I Love You Unquote\\" played by Dave Rotheray (ex-Beautiful South) and the drumming of Liam Bradley (Van Morrison, Ronan Keating) on three tracks. On track 5, Vigeland's Dream, McEvoy eloquently describes a walk she once took in Vigeland Sculpture Park which is a part of Frogner Park (Frognerparken), a public park located in the borough of Frogner, in Oslo, Norway. McEvoy toured the album extensively in Britain, Ireland, Spain and Australia throughout 2007 and early 2008. In 2007, Out There brought McEvoy her second \\"Record of the Year\\" award from Hi-Fi+ Magazine. Love Must Be Tough (MOSCD404, released 2008), her seventh album, is a departure from previous albums, where all the songs were typically her own. Half of this album features songs by other writers. Typically, these songs were written by men and sung by men but were about women. When sung by a woman, with the minimum of alteration to the lyrics, the words tell a new story. It revels in gender juxtaposition. The lead single, \\"Old, New, Borrowed and Blue\\", written by McEvoy and long-time friend Dave Rotheray (Beautiful South/Homespun), is a twist on the jaundiced over-optimism of the standard wedding song. Another track by the duo, \\"The Night May Still Be Young, But I Am Not\\", is also on the album. In 2008, McEvoy received her third \\"Record of the Year\\" award from Hi-Fi+ Magazine. In 2007, McEvoy was awarded \\"Best Traditional Act\\" at the 7th annual Big Buzz Awards, which are voted for entirely by the general public. In 2008, McEvoy toured from January to November in the UK, Australia, Spain, Germany, Poland, and Ireland, with additional one-off dates in the Far East and elsewhere in Europe, including an appearance at Glastonbury in June 2008. On 21 November 2008, \\"Easy in Love\\" from the album Love Must Be Tough was released as a single to highlight McEvoy's visit to Uganda on behalf of Oxfam Ireland. McEvoy's album Singled Out was released on 28 September 2008. The album is a compilation of singles taken from McEvoy's four award-winning, independently released albums. Three of the albums, Yola, Out There, and Love Must Be Tough, received the Album of the Year Award from Hi-Fi+ Magazine. Early Hours was voted Best Contemporary Album 2004‚Äì2005 by Irish Music Magazine Readers Poll. The album includes \\"Did I Hurt You\\" and \\"Isn't It a Little Late\\" from McEvoy's double A-side single, the world's first single to be released on SACD format. Singled Out includes one new song, \\"Oh Uganda\\", which was written by McEvoy after her visit to Northern Uganda as part of her support for the work of Oxfam Unwrapped. I'd Rather Go Blonde, released 20 September 2010, is McEvoy's eighth album. and was met with good reviews including the five-star review in 2010 Maverick Magazine: \\"This absolutely stunning album, has been a real find ‚Äì one of the most compelling female singer-songwriters I've heard in a long time.\\" Alone, McEvoy's ninth album, released 12 September 2011, is a collection of twelve stripped-down solo numbers. Says McEvoy, \\"\\"There was a time when I was stranded in a long gap between tour dates and, with time to kill, I headed for the peace of The Grange; a small studio tucked away in the Norfolk countryside.\\" The product of those tranquil sessions is an album of incredibly haunting performances, up close, personal, and timeless. This is McEvoy in her most intimate setting, running through the journey of her writing and singing career. If You Leave... McEvoy's tenth studio album was released 6 May 2013. It features eight new songs and four interpretations including \\"God Only Knows\\", \\"True Colors\\", and \\"Lift The Wings\\" from Riverdance. Said McEvoy, \\"I'd been listening to a lot of 60s albums, Stones, Beatles, Beach Boys stuff like that and it was with the spirit of those albums in my musical soul that I entered the studio.\\" \\"STUFF\\" McEvoy's eleventh studio album, was released on 21 March 2014. The tracks on the album were compiled to meet the requests from fans for songs they couldn't find elsewhere. McEvoy chose the songs from her collection of single mixes, audiophile tracks, and songs written and performed on other artists records. McEvoy then went into the studio to record tracks that weren't found in her collection. After all songs were recorded the entire album was re-mastered. Naked Music is McEvoy's twelfth studio album, recorded at the Grange Studio in Norfolk, UK. McEvoy recorded the tracks by \\"studio- performing\\", in other words, playing the songs as she would in a live performance. The album's concept was partially inspired by a painting entitled 'Champagne Sheila' by Chris Gollon, and the cover artwork features four of his paintings. In January 2016 in association with IAP Fine Art, the album was launched in London, in an exhibition of Gollon's paintings inspired by the album's songs. Later the same year NAKED MUSIC: The Songbook was published by Hot Press, documenting the association and collaboration, the songs and the paintings they inspired, with text and interviews by Jackie Hayden. One of the songs on the album, Eleanor McEvoy co-wrote with Lloyd Cole entitled 'Dreaming of Leaving', which then inspired a painting by Chris Gollon 'Dreaming of Leaving (I)', which was featured inside the album cover. This painting in turn inspired McEvoy to write the song 'Gimme Some Wine', which she wrote for and dedicated to Chris Gollon. This unusual and ongoing experiment in artistic 'boundary crossing' proved very fruitful, as songs inspired paintings, which in turn inspired songs that inspired paintings. Chris Gollon responded to the song 'Gimme Some Wine' by painting 23 works, some on paper, some on canvas, and they were his last great series of paintings before his untimely death in April 2017. They were first exhibited at IAP Fine Art in Monmouth in the 'Gimme Some Wine' exhibition, with Eleanor McEvoy performing the song that inspired them at the private view. In 2017 McEvoy was appointed Chairperson of the Irish Music Rights Organisation (IMRO).' In 2019, the two-year collaboration with Chris Gollon featured in the three-month major museum retrospective at Huddersfield Art Gallery, showing Gollon's music-related works and including the canvas 'Gimme Some Wine - Final Version', for which Eleanor McEvoy made a special recording of the song 'Gimme Some Wine'. Only A Woman's Heart \\"Only A Woman's Heart\\" written by McEvoy is the title song of the album A Woman's Heart which went on to sell over three-quarters of a million copies in Ireland alone and was (and remains) the biggest selling Irish album of all time. The song \\"Only A Woman's Heart\\" has been covered by a number of artists including: *Emmylou Harris with Mary Black on Black's 1996 album Wonder Child *Phil Coulter on his 2005 album Recollections *French Canadian singer Isabelle Boulay. Boulay's version appeared on her album De retour √† la source, which was nominated as one of the five finalists for the 2008 Juno Awards for the category \\"Francophone Album of The Year\\". *Les mejores canciones dance del Siglo XX ‚Äì Vol. 11, 2011 *Celtic Woman 2012 album Celtic Woman: Believe \\"Only A Woman's Heart\\" also has a page and half mention in Charles Webb's book New Cardiff, which was made into the movie Hope Springs. Webb's book, The Graduate, was the basis for the award-winning film The Graduate. 2012 marks the twentieth anniversary of A Woman's Heart. The anniversary was celebrated with four sold-out performances at the Olympia Theatre in Dublin, Ireland. Eleanor McEvoy, Mary Coughlan, Sharon Shannon, Dolores Keane, Wallis Bird, and Hermione Hennessy were on the bill. Further anniversary concerts are being planned. In April 2012, Kiera Murphy produced at documentary entitled Our Woman's Hearts which explores how A Woman's Heart came about, why it became so popular, as well as the effect it has had on three generations of women. The documentary is a part of RT√â Radio 1's series Documentary on One. The Secret of Living , written by McEvoy, was released in July 2012 to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of the iconic A Woman‚Äôs Heart. The song is performed by McEvoy, Mary Coughlan, Sharon Shannon, Gemma Hayes, and Hermione Hennessey. In a review from Hot Press, The Secret of Living was described as a classy new single from the A Woman's Heart group.

The sell-out performance formed part of the annual BEO Festival, hosted by the National Concert Hall and sponsored by the ESB. The songs, with their new arrangements, were drawn from McEvoy's first five albums, incorporating music from Yola and Early Hours, along with many others, including \\"Whisper a Prayer to the Moon\\" (from Pierce Brosnan's The Nephew), \\"Famine\\" (from The Gathering the Commemoration of the Irish Famine), and of course her contribution to the canon of Irish music standards, \\"Only a Woman‚Äôs Heart\\". ; Homespun and Dave Rotheray In January 2006, McEvoy supported the band Homespun on a British tour in support of their second album, Effortless Cool.

The concert was recorded by the ABC Australia. The show was broadcast on ABC Radio National on 18 May and then again on Sunday 20 May. Due to demand from ABC Australia listeners, Brewster Brothers in Concert Live at the Port Fairy Folk Festival was released shortly afterwards. ; Paul Brady at Vicar Street In October 2001, Paul Brady took over Vicar Street (one of the most popular music venues in Dublin) for twenty three nights to revisit his entire career. It was a bold move and a great success. Over the course of the month more than 16,000 people saw the shows. As well as a chance to revisit past material Paul availed of the opportunity to invite many of the artists he has worked or written with over the last thirty years to come and play. Among them were Bonnie Raitt, Mark Knopfler, Van Morrison, Sin√©ad O'Connor, Curtis Stigers, Maura O'Connell, Mary Black, Ronan Keating, Brian Kennedy, Gavin Friday, Tim O'Brien, Arty McGlynn, The Hothouse Flowers. and many more. McEvoy joined him for Thursday 12 October. Highlights of the night were Paul and McEvoy singing a duet on \\"You and I\\" an antiracism song of Paul's and Paul's rendition of McEvoy's song \\"Last Seen 9 October\\". ; The Great Irish Famine Event ‚Äì The National Concert Hall' McEvoy was commissioned by the Irish Government to write a piece about The Irish Famine for a concert held in the National Concert Hall in Dublin in 1997. The song was \\"Famine 1848\\". It is an orchestral piece with vocal part sung by McEvoy. The event entitled \\"The Great Irish Famine Event\\" was held to commemorate the Irish Potato Famine of 1845‚Äì1852. The song Famine also features on a limited edition version of the album What's Following Me? (Columbia Records). ; \\"Eleanor McEvoy Presents\\", Wexford Arts Centre \\"ELEANOR McEVOY PRESENTS\\" was a project which was instigated for the reopening of the Wexford Arts Centre in October 2006.

Retrieved December 20, 2018 born May 24, 1942) is a former American football quarterback, star quarterback with Calgary Stampeders in the late-60s and later a university athletics administrator. High school and college football careers Liske played his high school football in Plainfield, New Jersey, and graduated from Plainfield High School in 1959.Pete Liske profile , database Football. Accessed September 8, 2007. He was good enough to go on to the powerhouse Penn State Nittany Lions, and was later (on October 6, 2000) elected to the Plainfield High School Hall of Fame (as was Vic Washington, another football player, who coincidentally played against Liske in the CFL's 56th Grey Cup.) He played for Penn State from 1961 to 1963, quarterbacking winning teams each year. In 1961, he saw limited action (17 for 32 and 216 yards) but was a starter in the other years. In 1962, he completed 91 of 162 passes for 1,037 yards and 12 touchdowns (with four interceptions.) In 1963, he completed 87 of 161 passes for 1,117 yards and ten touchdowns (with five picks.) Professional career Prior to his fifth-year senior season at Penn State, Liske was drafted in 1963 by both American professional football leagues, the NFL and AFL. The Philadelphia Eagles picked him in the tenth round, 130th overall, of the NFL Draft and the American Football League New York Titans picked him in the 15th round, 115 overall of the AFL Draft. He chose the AFL, and played with the newly renamed New York Jets. Liske saw limited playing time in 1964 with New York, playing in only four games (only 18 passes). His career took a turn up north, with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League. Canadian teams of this time were still a very viable career option, as they paid comparable money and offered more playing time. Liske played 11 games with Toronto in 1965. From 1966 to 1968, he moved to the Calgary Stampeders, where he enjoyed his greatest success as a professional. In 1967, he threw for 4,479 yards, a whopping figure for that era, and 40 touchdowns, the latter breaking Tobin Rote's league record of 38 in 1960 for Toronto. His touchdown record would stay in place until Doug Flutie surpassed him in 1993. He was named an all- star and won the CFL's Most Outstanding Player Award. In 1968, after a season comprising 4,333 yards passing and 31 touchdowns (though with 28 interceptions), he led his team to the 56th Grey Cup, losing a close and exciting game to the Ottawa Rough Riders. Liske's passing records would eventually be eclipsed by Doug Flutie's in a more wide-open era. Liske chose to return to the AFL in 1969, joining the Denver Broncos and playing seven games with them. In 1970, now in the NFL, he played 11 games with Denver. He moved on to the Philadelphia Eagles for the 1971 and 1972 seasons, playing 14 games in each season. Unfortunately, he did not enjoy the success he had in the CFL, as none of his teams had a winning season. His combined total American professional record was: 50 games over five seasons, with 396 of 778 passes completed, for 5170 yards and 30 touchdowns with 46 interceptions. Canada beckoned once again, and in 1973 he rejoined the Stampeders. He remained in Calgary until part way through the 1974 season, when he joined the British Columbia Lions. In Calgary for a second time around, he did not enjoy the same success, throwing more interceptions than touchdowns in 1973 and 1974. In 1975, his last season, still with the Lions, he completed 152 of 280 passes for 2310 yards and 13 touchdowns with 9 picks. Later life and honors In 2002 Liske's number 14 was added to the Calgary Stampeders' Wall of Fame. He was a game official in the NFL from 1983 through 1988, a back judge wearing uniform number 21. Liske left the private sector in 1985 for the University of Washington in Seattle, where he started as an associate athletic director, with a focus on fundraising and promotions. He became the athletic director at the University of Idaho in Moscow in 1992, and moved to the University of Toledo in 1996. In late 2001, Liske returned to his alma mater, Penn State, where he was appointed director of major gifts for intercollegiate athletics, with special emphasis on developing funding for the improvement of athletic facilities.

Smith Infirmary, the institution adopted its current name during the 1990s with the merger of Staten Island Hospital (now the North Campus) and the Richmond Memorial Hospital (now the South Campus). SIUH maintains an academic affiliation with the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center College of Medicine and Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine, whose medical students and residents complete a portion of their training at SIUH. SIUH also operates, in conjunction with Wagner College, a Physician Assistant training program and a Physician Assistant Fellowship in Emergency Medicine. SIUH is one of three hospitals in Staten Island and the only one that has an Emergency Medicine Residency. Dr. Gilbert Lederman became the director of SIUH's radiation oncology department, at age 34. During his tenure, he greatly expanded the department's capacity and installed state-of- the-art equipment, and, \\"In 1991, Lederman became the first doctor in New York to offer brain radiosurgery.\\" He also aggressively promoted the new treatment, through media advertisements, interviews, presentations at the hospital, attended by \\"groups of grateful formal patients\\" (later dubbed \\"Lederman clubs\\" and likened to medicine shows, by trial attorney Jonathan Behrins), and an international tour, comprising Lederman's travels to \\"Italy, England, Israel, and many other countries to speak to prospective patients and examine their CT scans on the spot.\\" The hospital ultimately \\"started an International Patient Program and opened an office in Naples, Italy. Soon, sick people from all over the world were flying in. Even an ailing Beatle (George Harrison) was willing to give the magic ray gun a shot.

When the news was publicised, Harrison bemoaned his physician's breach of privacy, and his estate later claimed damages. Harrison's estate later complained that during a round of experimental radiotherapy at Staten Island University Hospital, the oncologist Dr. Gilbert Lederman repeatedly revealed Harrison's confidential medical information during television interviews and forced him to autograph a guitar.{{rp330‚Äì331Civil Action CV040033 (NGG) (PDF), Complaint, United States District Court, Eastern District of New York, The Estate of George Harrison v Gilbert Lederman.

Many details of the Crusade are debated. After the crusade Tavastia gradually started to fall under the rule of the Catholic Church and Swedish kingdom. Background A sculpted head in Varnhem Church, identified as the likeness of Birger Jarl, leader of the Crusade Sweden had been starting to exert control over Finland at least since the beginning in the 13th century, starting with Finland proper. In 1220, Sweden tried to join in on the Baltic Crusades, but could not hold on to their foothold in Estonia. There are notes of Swedish churchmen, possibly led by Finland's bishop Thomas, being present in Tavastia ca 1230, and papal letters deplored how slowly Christianity gained ground in Finland. There was apparently a backlash against the missionaries (the H√§me insurrection), and in 1237, Pope Gregory IX sent out a call for the Swedes to take up arms in a crusade against the \\"apostates and barbarians\\".Harrison (2005), p.425-426 In Latin. Sources All details of the crusade are from Eric's Chronicle, which is largely propagandist in nature, written a century after the events, amidst internal unrest and a war against Novgorod. The chronicle says that the crusade took place between the Battle of Sparrs√§tra in 1247 and the death of King Eric (XI) in 1250, and presents the Tavastians (taffwesta) as the Swedish opponents. According to the chronicle, the expedition was prepared in Sweden and then conducted over sea to a land on the coast, where the enemy was waiting.Description of the crusade. Original text. The Chronicle also mentioned that a castle called taffwesta borg was established after the war. The Chronicle also linked the Crusade to a contest with the Orthodox Russians, making a point of the fact that the \\"Russian king\\" had now lost the conquered land. The so-called \\"Detmar Chronicle\\" of L√ºbeck from around 1340 confirmed the expedition with a short note that Birger Jarl submitted Finland under Swedish rule.Suomen varhaiskeskiajan l√§hteit√§, 1989. . See page 7. Interpretations Unlike the doubted First Swedish crusade, there seems to be little doubt that Sweden's effort to Christianize Finland reached a culmination in the middle of the 13th century. Still, many details, including the year and the exact nature, remain the subject of debate. =Nature of the Crusade= Although the Chronicles attempted to paint the Crusade as a war of conquest, it was likely more of an unusually bloody phase in the ongoing process by which Finland was incorporated in the Swedish state. Sweden had a central government and a strong ideological force in the form of the Catholic church. The Finnish chieftains who joined gained power and prestige.Harrison (2005), p 425; Tarkiainen (2008), p. 101 =Dating= The dating of the Crusade has been somewhat disputed. In addition to the 1247‚Äì1250 date given in \\"Eric's Chronicle\\", proposals have been made to date the attack to either 1238‚Äì1239 or 1256. Neither of the latter dates has received wide acceptance.Finnish Antiquarian Society, Suomen Museo 2002, page 66 Swedish historian Dick Harrison finds the theory of an early crusade most probable, based on the papal letter, which would also make the war a properly sanctioned crusade, and the fact that Sweden was otherwise peaceful during that period.Harrison (2005), p 427 =Taffwesta borg= The Chronicle mentioned an impressive castle that was built by the Swedes, taffwesta borg. This has been interpreted as either H√§me Castle (Swedish Tavastehus) or the nearby Hakoinen Castle, but there is no archaeological evidence at either site to support such an early dating. Aftermath =Church reaction and reorganization= Probably in an effort to prevent other parties from getting involved in the conflict, Pope Innocent IV took Finland under his special protection in August 1249 but without mentioning Sweden in any way. In Latin. The bishop of Finland, Thomas, probably a Dominican friar, had resigned already in 1245 and died three years later in a Dominican convent in Gotland. The seat being vacant, the diocese had probably been under the direct command of the papal legate, William of Modena, whose last orders to Finnish priests were given in June 1248. In Latin. Bero was eventually appointed as the new bishop in 1248/9, presumably soon after William's visit to Sweden for an important church meeting at Sk√§nninge that ended on 1 March 1248. The so-called \\"Palmsk√∂ld booklet\\" from 1448 noted that it was Bero who gave the Finns' tax to the Swedish king.Original text as hosted by the University of Columbia; in Latin. See also Suomen varhaiskeskiajan l√§hteit√§, 1989. . Page 7. Bero came directly from the Swedish court, like his two successors. It seems that Swedish bishops also held all secular power in Finland until the 1280s, when the position of the Duke of Finland was established. In 1249, the situation was also seen clear enough to establish the first monastery in Finland, a Dominican convent. In Latin. The convent was next to the bishop's fortification in Koroinen until the end of the century. =Swedish succession= Eric's Chronicle tells of how, as an unexpected side effect, the expedition seems to have cost Birger the Swedish crown. When King Eric died in 1250, Birger was absent from Sweden. The Swedish lords, led by Joar Bl√•, selected Birger's underaged son Valdemar as the new king, instead of the powerful jarl himself. =Swedish rule in Finland= From 1249 onwards, sources generally regard Finland Proper and Tavastia as a part of Sweden. The Diocese of Finland proper is listed among the Swedish dioceses for the first time in 1253.Surviving lists from 1241 and 1248 still did not include Finland. In the Novgorod First Chronicle, Tavastians (yem) and Finns proper (sum) are mentioned on an expedition with Swedes (svei) in 1256.. In Swedish. However, very little is known about the situation in Finland in the following decades. That is partly because Western Finland was now ruled from Turku and so most of the documents remained there. As the Novgorod forces burned the city in 1318 during the Swedish-Novgorodian Wars, very few of the documents about what had happened in the previous century remained. The last Swedish Crusade to Finland took place in 1293 against Karelians.  Eric's Chronicle: \\"Crusade against Tavastians\\"  { King Erik then sent out a call to knights and to their equals all, to peasants and to fighting men, ‚Äì as ruler still do now, as then, to notify their men before they send them off to fight a war ‚Äì he sent them thus to heathen land and chose his in-law to take in hand to lead them all upon that quest, for him of all he trusted best. His son-in-law was eager to go, keen his honour there to show. Then arms and armour were prepared by warriors brave, who nothing feared. Helmets and body-armour burnished were in demand, and more were furnished. Each in his district did his best, ready to heed the king\`s request,  and warships and transport set afloat. Many a money-bag was brought out, its contents did those men receive who now their homes were due to leave not knowing where their journey led Hands were wrung and tears were shed by many a wife left on her own. Yet they rejoiced that God\`s renown would grow and He be more adored. Many an old ancestral sword was then from nails unslung where it for many a day had hung. Their friends them followed to the strand to bid farewell and clasp their hand Many a red mouth was kissed that day that never again was kissed that way, for some never more would each other see \\\\- such can the outcome of such partings be. Fair winds arose, the sails were set. The heathen, too, foresaw the threat they well knew that their coming would be to their harm and not their good. There the Christians a harbour did find. Innumerable gilded prows aligned the heathen men saw lying there, causing them less to laugh than fear. They took their banners and went ashore. Fate then favored the Christians more: their bright shields there and helmets they throughout that country did display. They eager were to try their swords upon the Heathen Tavast hordes, which I expect is what occurred. With gold and silver and many a herd of cattle the Tavasts away did run. The heathen lost, the Christians won. Whoever would this them agree to become a Christian and baptised be, him they allowed both goods and life and peace to live withour further strife. The heathen who would them gainsay they did mercilessly slay. The Christians there a fortress did build, which they with friend and kinsmen filled. That castle they Tavasteborg did call; it to this day does the heathen gall. With Christian men they settled that land, a deed, I think, that does yet stand. That land became Christian through and through the Russian king its loss must rue. } See also * Early Finnish wars * First Swedish Crusade * Third Swedish Crusade * Northern Crusades * Battle of Lihula * Battle of the Neva References  Sources * * Category:13th- century crusades Category:13th century in Finland Category:13th century in Sweden Category:Conflicts in 1249 Category:Wars involving Sweden Category:Wars involving Finland Category:Northern Crusades ","title":"Second Swedish Crusade"},{"id":"8028068","title":"North Dakota Mr. Basketball"},{"id":"8028091","text":"Eric IX of Sweden and Bishop Henry en route to Finland. Late mediaeval depiction from Uppland. The First Swedish Crusade was a mythical military expedition in the 1150s to Southwest Finland by Swedish King Eric IX and English Bishop Henry of Uppsala. Earliest written sources of the crusade are from the end of 13th Century. The main sources of the crusade, the legend of Saint Erik and the legend of Saint Henry, describes that the reason for the crusade were the multiple raids that pagan Finns made to Sweden. The crusade has traditionally been seen as the first attempt of the Catholic Church and Sweden to convert pagan Finns to Christianity. However, the Christianisation of the South-western part of Finland is known to have already started in 10th century, and in the 12th century, the area was probably almost entirely Christian. According to legends, after the crusade Bishop Henry was killed at lake K√∂yli√∂nj√§rvi by Lalli. He later became a central figure of the Catholic Church in Finland.. Original medieval legend in Latin.  Veracity of the crusade  Academics debate whether this crusade actually took place. No archaeological data give any support for it and earliest written sources are from much later date. No surviving written source describes Swedish influence in Finland before the end of the 13th Century. Furthermore, the diocese and bishop of Finland are not listed among their Swedish counterparts before the 1250s. Also, the Christianisation of the South-western part of Finland is known to have already started in 10th century, and in the 12th century, the area was probably almost entirely Christian. The Swedish bishop normally involved in the eastern campaigns was the Bishop of Link√∂ping, not the Bishop of Uppsala. The mid-12th century was a very violent time in the northern Baltic sea, with Finnish tribes such as Tavastians and Karelians as well as Swedes in frequent conflicts with Novgorod and with each other.See articles Swedish-Novgorodian Wars and Prehistoric Finnish wars. The First Novgorod Chronicle tells that in 1142 a Swedish \\"prince\\" and bishop accompanied by a fleet of 60 ships plundered just three Novgorodian merchant vessels somewhere \\"on the other side of the sea\\", obviously being after something more important.. In Swedish.  Timing of the crusade  Almost every year of the 1150s has been suggested as the year that the crusade possibly took place. Most widely supported years have been years 1150, 1155, 1157 and 1158. Other candidates have been years 1153, 1154 and 1156. At the time, leading the lei√∞angr was the responsibility of the jarl. That gave rise to a theory that Eric conducted the expedition before he became king or pretender to the throne. Legends give no year for the expedition but attempts to date it to an exact year in the 1150s are all much later speculations.

It is owned by the George C. Marshall International Center, which has restored the property to its Marshall-era appearance of the 1950s. It is nationally significant as the home of George C. Marshall, Chief of Staff of the United States Army during World War II, Secretary of State, President of the American Red Cross, and Secretary of Defense. Description and history George Catlett Marshall, who was Army Chief of Staff, special envoy to China, Secretary of State, President of the Red Cross, Secretary of Defense, and namesake of the Marshall Plan, and his wife Katherine Marshall purchased the property for $16,000 in 1941 and lived there until his death on October 16, 1959. Legend has it that Katherine paid the owners $10 earnest money and threw the \\"for sale\\" sign into the bushes as she left to discourage the competition. Except for a winter home in Pinehurst, N.C., this house was the only home Marshall ever owned, and was the backdrop to quiet conversations and contemplations of international importance. Katherine gave the house and 3.88 acres to her daughter, Molly Winn, in 1960 while she moved to Pinehurst for permanent residence. When Mrs. Winn expressed her desire to sell the property in the early 1990s, several prominent Leesburg citizens under the leadership of B. Powell Harrison were concerned that the property might fall into commercial hands and be demolished and urged the Town of Leesburg to purchase it. That proved to be impossible, so the citizens formed the George C. Marshall Home Preservation Fund, later the George C. Marshall International Center, and purchased Dodona Manor for $2.3 million. After renovations costing more than $4.5 million, the house opened as a museum on Veterans Day in 2005. Much of the money for the purchase and renovation was donated by European nations that had benefited from the Marshall Plan. Further funding was provided by grants from the Commonwealth of Virginia, National Park Service (Save America's Treasures program), U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Garden Club of Virginia, and generous private donations.George C. Marshall International Center The house was named Dodona Manor before the Marshalls purchased it. The name derives from Dodona, . a shrine in ancient Greece where priests and priestesses interpreted the rustling of oak (and beech) leaves as messages from the gods. Dating from the second millennium BCE, the Dodona shrine was considered to be second in prestige only to Delphi. Due to the large amount of oak trees located on and around the property, naming the house Dodona Manor seemed appropriate. There is evidence that a two-story house existed on the property with five-course American brickwork in the early 1800s. John Drish, who purchased the property in 1805, added a Federal-style wing with Flemish bond brickwork and keystone arches in the mid-1820s and gave the property to his son Wilson Drish, who sold it to Fayette Ball, a distant relative of George Washington, in 1855. In 1856, the Rev. Charles Nourse, principal of the Leesburg Academy, purchased it. He tried unsuccessfully to sell it in 1859, and then opened the Loudoun Female Collegiate Institute in the house in 1860, after completing an addition to increase the number of bedrooms. Subsequent owners included Sophia Delany, Joseph and Martha Prather, Wallace and Sally George, Yvon and Ella Pike and Marcia McCann Ely and Northcutt Ely, who added electricity and indoor plumbing and eventually sold it to the Marshalls. The Marshalls also added two bay windows, a stone court, and changed the wooden porch to a more durable brick. Dodona Manor is unique among historic houses because over 90% of the furnishings and memorabilia in the house were owned and used by the Marshalls and were obtained from Mrs. Marshall's heirs. Due to the extensive disrepair over time, detailed plans for the conservation and placement of the collection and for the reproduction of the original floor and wall coverings were developed by Dr. William Seale, a leading expert in the field, and Anne Horstman, who served as executive vice president of the Marshall Center during the restoration. Among the items are originals or reproductions of art given to the Marshalls, including a reproduction of View of Tinherir, painted by Sir Winston Churchill in Morocco in 1951 and given to the Marshalls in 1953. The original View of Tinherir was sold at auction by Marshall's granddaughter Kitty Winn in 2006 for ¬£612,800 ($1.2 million), a record price for a Churchill painting at that time. Another reproduction is Evening, by Russian artist Vassily Baksheyev. The original was a gift to Marshall from Vyacheslav Molotov, foreign minister of the Soviet Union, in 1947 in appreciation for Marshall's efforts in World War II. Dodona Manor also has an original black and white landscape painted by Soong Mei-ling, wife of the president of the Republic of China, Chiang Kai-shek. She and the Marshalls became close friends when Marshall was President Harry Truman‚Äôs special envoy to China in 1946‚Äì47, and Madame Chiang visited Dodona Manor on at least one occasion. Other pieces of Chinese art in the house include a painting by Wen Xuan Dai, a gift from the Chiangs to Katherine on her 64th birthday in 1946, and a fish painting by Tzulu Shen gifted by the Chinese Cultural Enterprise as a thank you for Marshall's efforts in China. For Christmas 1959, two months after Marshall died, President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent a print of his Mount Eisenhower, currently Castle Mountain, located in Alberta, Canada, watercolor to Katherine with a handwritten note. Both are on display in Dodona Manor. Also on display is Marshall's favorite red La-Z-boy next to his General Electric radio and television combination set, where he would listen to his favorite baseball team, the Brooklyn Dodgers, and watch his favorite TV shows including I Love Lucy, Gunsmoke, and American Bandstand in one of the most comfortable rooms in the house, the library. This room includes many treasured items including figurines of a Chinese wedding procession given to Marshall by Madame Chiang Kai-chek, a portrait of Colonel Robert E. Lee, and scores of original books, usually historical biographies. Although Lee attended West Point and Marshall attended VMI, Marshall considered General Lee and George Washington brilliant military strategists which is evident by the multiple portraits seen throughout the house. Due to her fondness for the Marshalls, Madame Chiang visited and stayed at Dodona Manor many times throughout the 1940s and 1950s. The original master bedroom was converted to a guest bedroom, while George and Katherine occupied the two original guest bedrooms adjoined by a Jack and Jill bathroom. Their use of separate bedrooms could be accounted for by their two different lifestyles; George was a military man who woke up early and enjoyed his own space, similar to the days of military barracks living whereas Katherine enjoyed sleeping in with breakfast in bed. Madame Chiang also brought anywhere from three to five servants with her who would have stayed in the grandchildren's nursery. To protect the views from Dodona Manor, the Marshalls purchased eleven surrounding properties. These properties generate revenue to support the organization. The grounds have been restored to their Marshall-era appearance of the 1950s and include a large vegetable garden that was restorative as an antidote to the pressures Marshall felt as Army Chief of Staff. Katherine delighted in growing roses, and a restored rose garden features the types of roses she cultivated. George Marshall himself was known as a great proponent of mulch in gardening. George C. Marshall's Dodona Manor was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1996.

It has graduated over 1200 students in its over 35 years of operation. History The idea for a guitar making school grew out of a 1968 Glendale Community College course in guitar making taught by Carl Samuels. This course led to an apprenticeship program that John Roberts started back in 1969 called the Juan Roberto Guitar Works. Before this, Roberts found himself in the jungles of Nicaragua, flying airplanes for a wood import company. Much of the rosewood and mahogany used at the school was collected with the help of the Miskito Indians and shipped to Phoenix where Roberts began his guitar making endeavor. John Roberts died in the summer of 1999. Robert Venn (1926‚Äì1991) joined with Roberts in 1973, and brought custom electric guitar making expertise to the guitar partnership. Venn was one a handful of guitar makers in the 1950s and 60's to wind his own pickups and use wooden pickup covers aesthetically matched with the highly figured hardwoods he used in the body and neck of his instruments. Venn built or repaired for fine guitarists such as Phil Baugh, Maurice Anderson, Tom Morrell, Bud Isaacs, Norm Hamlet, and Tiny Moore. William Eaton apprenticed with John Roberts in 1971. He wrote a business plan for a guitar making school in 1974, while acquiring an MBA degree from the Stanford Graduate School of Business. The plan became the blueprint for the Roberto-Venn School of Luthiery, which Roberts, Venn, Eaton, and Bruce Scotten incorporated and founded in 1975. Eaton added new elements of stringed instrument design and innovations, creating multi-stringed, one-of-a-kind instruments at the school since 1976. Eaton is the director of Roberto-Venn School of Luthiery.

It is a type of Modulation-Dependent Carrier Level control, or MDCL. All modern high- power (>50 kW) shortwave radio transmitters incorporate DCC of some kind, as well as some mediumwave (MW) transmitters. DCC causes the carrier wave level to be automatically reduced when the audio is very weak or no audio is present. During periods of silence (no audio), the carrier power is reduced by 50%, so the 250 kW transmitter is putting out a carrier of 125 kW during audio pauses. This carrier power reduction saves electricity.  History  This amplitude modulation (and vestigial SSB modulation) energy-saving mode was devised in the late 1930s. The system was originally referred to as the Hapsburg Carrier System. DCC was not implemented in transmitter designs until the 1980s, because of some of the complexities of the control circuit. * DCC's development is linked to NATO nations trying to save energy as a result of the ripple effects of OPEC related oil supply crises. * DCC is still an option on all shortwave transmitters sold on the open market today, since it is almost universally mandated by the purchasers of shortwave transmitters. * Eastern European manufacturers of shortwave transmitters tended not to adopt DCC because Russia in particular had no energy crises, due to its abundant supply of oil.  MDCL methods  There are two types of Modulation-Dependent Carrier Level (MDCL) control methods: DCC, as discussed above, and Amplitude Modulation Companding (AMC), developed by the BBC.https://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/publications/whitepaper333 The AMC design achieves the opposite effect of the original DCC system: the carrier is at maximum when no audio is present, and is reduced by up to 75% when the audio is loudest. The system uses the carrier to quieten the channel when no audio is present, while still realizing power savings. Both DCC and AMC have been a staple in European MW broadcasting for many years, and now AMC is now being used by stations in North America.Crawford Saving Money with MDCL and Nautel Transmitters Both the above MDCL methods (DDC and AMC) can be used simultaneously if desired. Some stations choose a mixture of DCC and AMC which uses a complex carrier vs. modulation curve, typically running less carrier for modulation in the 25% to 75% range, and with more carrier during peaks and pauses. DCC can work with frequency modulation (FM), but was never adopted for high-power FM stereo transmission.  Advantages and disadvantages of MDCL methods The main reason for using either MDCL method (or the combination of the two) is to save power and money. Alternatively, for the same total power consumption, the transmission coverage can be somewhat improved. The AMC method has two other advantages. It limits the peak voltages on transmitter and antenna circuits, possibly preventing damaging arcs. Also, if the degree of AMC is properly adjusted, the power drawn from the mains can be kept nearly constant with modulation. This is especially important when operating from a local generator. With conventional DCC the load variations on a generator are made worse. With both methods, the main disadvantage is marginal loss of coverage, comparable to running slightly less power. Also in lower signal strength parts of the coverage area, a station using Dynamic Carrier Control may be more likely to be skipped on digital-tuned radios during seek/scan tuning (if the frequency is passed during carrier reduction), an issue compounded by manual tuning (instead of seek/scan) selection not being easy on some receivers.  Operational use  When running a transmitter with DCC, these settings are recommended to optimize power savings versus the listener's receiver \\"signal lock\\" loss. * DCC (attack, decay) : instantaneous * DCC (carrier power suppression): 3dB (for third-hop targets) * DCC (carrier power suppression): 6dB (for first-hop targets) Occasional misuses of DCC * Radio New Zealand International, due to long-term funding problems, has had to resort to using 6db of carrier suppression, making reception in North America difficult. * DCC can make DXing SW signals more difficult.  Transmitters using DCC  Here is a list of manufacturers that offer DCC in their transmitters: * Ampegon AG (Ex-Thales) * Continental Electronics * Nautel * RIZ * Telefunken * Transradio  Possible future obsolescence  Digital transmissions such as used with Digital Radio Mondiale have a constant power level even during program pauses and once they replace standard analogue amplitude modulated signals, will make DCC unnecessary for audio broadcasting via shortwave. However, some of the same circuits used for DCC also make it easy to adjust the power level when operating in the digital mode. DRM signals use only a fraction of the power to achieve the same coverage as an AM transmitter, so the cost savings feature of DCC will not be needed. ;Analog modes: *A3E AM (incl.

The contracting parties would cut their wrists and pour their blood into a cup filled with liquid, such as wine, and drink the mixture. A famous example of the blood compact was the 1565 Sandugo between Spanish explorer Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi and Datu Sikatuna, the chieftain of Bohol. Another blood compact was done between the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan and Rajah Humabon of Cebu.Sandugo Festival Bohol Philippines www.philippinecountry.com Retrieved December 2006. Another type of blood compact was also described by Antonio Pigafetta during their stopover in Palawan (after the death of Magellan). It was made between the crew of the expedition and a datu of Palawan as a symbol of peaceful intentions. The datu made a small cut on his chest using a knife borrowed from the expedition. The datu then dipped a finger on the blood and touched it to the tip of his tongue and on his forehead. The crew of the expedition did the same to seal the compact. A similar ritual was practiced by initiates into the 19th century revolutionary group, the Katipunan. Though they did not consume their blood, they used it to sign their membership contracts. Another relatively recent blood compact was in the 1860s between the close friends Sultan Jamalul Alam of the Sultanate of Sulu and Herman Leopold Sch√ºck, a Prussian merchant mariner.

It opened on April 27, 1993. The hotel has 696 rooms and suites.  History  When it opened, the Shangri-La Makati was ‚Äúone of the first international five-star properties at a time where few large chains were present in the Philippines capital‚Äù. It was developed by the Ayala family with an aim to keep the area as Manila‚Äôs luxury address. Originally it opened with 703 rooms over its 28 floors, at a cost of $118 million. It was the first new hotel in Makati in 17 years and featured the largest meeting spaces in the city. The hotel has undergone several renovations over the years, including 3 restaurant overhauls and the refurbishing of more than 200 rooms in 2001 with finer optic cabling and broadband internet. The cost per room of the renovation was around $30,000. The entire renovation, which continued until the end of 2002, cost $130 million. The Rizal ballroom was renovated in 2009. A second ballroom named ‚ÄúIsabela‚Äù opened in November 2013 with an aim to provide a modern event space with interchangeable furniture and audiovisual technology. In 2010 the hotel embarked on a program called ‚ÄúGreen Housekeeping‚Äù in order to reduce the use of chemicals and improve cleanliness, with initiatives like low-temperature washing and lower electricity use. The same year it was the first hotel in the Philippines to equip its concierge team with iPads. The hotel achieves an average 80 percent occupancy, most of which are corporate clients such as the American Embassy. The current manager is Alain Borgers, from Belgium, former manager of the first Shangri-La in Europe, the Shangri-La Hotel, Paris. He was also the GM of Makati Shangri-La in 1999.  Design and construction  The hotel was designed by Kanko Kikaku Sekkeisha, Yozo Shibata & Association (Tokyo) & G. Formoso & Partners (Manila), both companies of which have designed multiple Shangri-La properties. During the 2002 renovations, General Manager Richard Riley directed and designed the amenities. The design team included specialists from the US, Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo, including Bilky Llinas, Leese Robertson Freeman Ltd., Warner Wong, Wilson Associates, BUZdesign, Adam Tihany, and Alan Chang.  Features  =Rooms and suites= The hotel has 696 rooms in 8 types, including 46 Deluxe Suites, 3 Specialty Suites overlooking Ayala Avenue, and 1 Presidential Suite, which measures 312 square meters. = Restaurants = Makati Shangri-La has six restaurants and bars. It also has an in-house deli bakery ‚ÄúSinfully Circles by Makati Shangri-La\\". Past the grand staircase at the lobby is Lobby Lounge. The venue was noted in 2013 for leading a popular phenomenon in Manila for people to drink British afternoon tea in the summertime. Makati Shangri-La was judged the overall winner in the professional division of Chefs on Parade in 2011, the longest cooking competition in the Philippines, and awarded the COP Presidential Trophy. The hotel's other outlets includes the Japanese restaurant Inagiku, Circles Event Cafe, an all-day dining restaurant, Shang Palace, Shangri-La's brand of Cantonese cuisine restaurant, Sage Bespoke Grill (formerly Red), the hotel's Pool Bar located at the fourth level, and Sage Bar formerly Conway's, the hotel bar.  Events  The hotel has multiple ballrooms and event spaces, and continues to add more, including the Isabela, named after Spain‚Äôs Queen Isabela, in November 2013. The Isabela includes works of art by Filipino painter RH Lascano, and is designed by Hong Kong-based LRF Design. The Makati Shangri-La is also the home to the ABS-CBN Ball (formerly called Star Magic Ball), an annual red carpet event featuring ABS-CBN artists. in which the ball itself is held in the Rizal Ballroom.

Early years, education, and military service Mitchell was born August 17th, 1924 in Dalton, Georgia, the second son of Douglas Wright and Mary Adelia Erwin Mitchell. He graduated from Dalton High School in 1940, at the age of 16. He then attended the Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina, before transferring to the University of Georgia. At age 18, with the onset of WW II, Mitchell volunteered for flight training with the Army Air Corps, serving overseas in the Pacific Theatre. From 1943 through 1946, he served as a first lieutenant in the United States Army Air Corps, engaging in combat, flying P-51's from Iwo Jima to Japan while escorting B-29's on bombing raids as well as participating in fighter strikes against air field, shipping, rail transportation and other strategic targets. He was recalled into service in the United States Air Force, during the Korean war, and served 17 months in 1951 and 1952. Between his years of service in the two military branches, Mitchell followed in the footsteps of his father, attended the University of Georgia School of Law in Athens and earned LL.B. in 1948. He was admitted to the bar on April 17, 1948, and established a law practiced in Dalton. Political service and law career While still in the Air Force, Mitchell ran for the position of Cherokee Judicial Circuit solicitor general, and was elected. He served in that position from January 1, 1953, until December 31, 1956. He was then elected as state's youngest Superior Court judge, at age 31. Serving in that position from January 1, 1957, until January 8, 1958. Upon the death of U.S. Representative Henderson Lovelace Lanham, in November 1957, Mitchell announced his intention to run for Georgia's 7th congressional district. He ran as a Democrat and won the special election to fill Lanham's term in the 85th United States Congress. He won re- election in 1958, but did not seek re-election in 1960. Mitchell was elected to the Georgia State Senate in 1960 and served for one full term. After his political service, Mitchell returned to his law practice in Dalton, establishing the firm Mitchell and Mitchell with his father, and brother Doug. Later years Mitchell continued to practice law and resided in Dalton until just before his death, on September 13, 2011 at the age of 87.

He was hired as a reporter by the Long Beach Independent the year after he graduated and was hired by the Los Angeles Times in 1968. In 1974, he was given an assignment by the paper's editor under which he would cover the news media. In 2002, he was given a column that was printed twice a week, once about news media and once about food and wine. During his tenure at the Los Angeles Times, Shaw was given the opportunity to spend weeks to months working on an investigation of a single topic that drew his attention, in contrast to the typical day-by-day reporting of most covering the news media. Shaw was more than willing to address issues at the Times itself, including a four-part series published in 1990 that showed that the paper had a record for employing and advancing minority workers that was one of the worst in the area. A 1999 report, running to 37,000 words, documented an unpublicized deal between the paper and the Staples Center under which a special Sunday supplement covering the arena would be published, with the proceeds from advertising split between the two, a deal considered to violate the \\"Chinese wall\\" preventing conflict of interest between the editorial and business portions of the paper. The report publicly criticized the parent company's CEO Mark H. Willes, publisher Kathryn M. Downing, and Shaw's boss, editor Michael Parks. He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism in 1991 for his coverage of the McMartin preschool trial and its claims that workers there had sexually abused children and performed Satanic rituals, which were later disproved and none of the accused were convicted after a trial that continued for several years.https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/david-shaw Shaw's investigations started after the verdicts were first released, and led him to conclude that the media did not perform investigative coverage of the prosecution's case, a failure that might have led to the earlier realization that the evidence offered in the case was \\"incredibly weak\\", as described by Ira Reiner, who had served as Los Angeles County District Attorney during the time of the trial. Books written by Shaw included his 1973 celebrity biography of Wilt Chamberlain, titled Wilt: Just Like Any Other 7-Foot Black Millionaire Who Lives Next Door. He also wrote the 1974 book The Levy Caper, Journalism Today: A Changing Press for a Changing America was published by Harper & Row in 1977, Press Watch came out in 1986, and he wrote his final published book in 1996, The Pleasure Police: How Bluenose Busybodies and Lily-Livered Alarmists Are Taking All the Fun Out of Life, published by Doubleday. =Personal= Shaw died at age 62 on August 1, 2005 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles due to a brain tumor. =Cultural references= Cellist Melora Creager wrote a song titled \\"Border Village\\" on her solo CD Perplexions in which David Shaw is mentioned in the last line as having died alone at 62.

Life Luke was born 21 March 1603 and baptised at six days old in Southill, Bedfordshire. He was the son of Sir Oliver Luke and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter and coheir of Sir Valentine Knightley of Fawsley, Northants. He attended Eton from 1617 to 1619 and travelled abroad in 1623. He was knighted on 20 July 1624. In April 1640, Luke was elected Member of Parliament for Bedford in the Short Parliament and was re-elected for the Long Parliament in November 1640. In the latter election he is known to have had the support of much of John Bunyan's future congregation. Luke was governor of the Parliamentary outpost in Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire from late 1642 until June 1644 during the English Civil War During the war he was also Scoutmaster to the Earl of Essex. He subscribed to the Solemn League and Covenant and in 1648 was secluded from the Long Parliament under Pride's Purge. Luke inherited the family estate on the death of his father in 1651. In April 1660, he was re-elected MP for Bedford in the Convention Parliament. He died in 1670 and was buried on 30 August in Cople, Bedfordshire. Mention in literature It is thought that Sir Samuel Luke was the basis for the title character of the satirical heroic poem Hudibras (1662) by Samuel Butler. Family On 2 February 1624, Luke married Elizabeth, daughter of William Freeman, haberdasher and merchant, of London.

Botelho (born October 6, 1948) is an American attorney and politician in the U.S. state of Alaska. He served as the mayor of Juneau from 1988 to 1991 and from 2003 to 2012. Born and raised in Juneau, where his father was a top official of the Alaska Highway Patrol, Botelho has pursued concurrent careers in law and politics, largely with success. He also previously served a term as mayor from 1988 to 1991, defeating former Alaska Secretary of State Robert W. Ward in the election. He spent most of his professional career as an employee of the Alaska Department of Law. He rose to the top position in the department in 1994, when Governor Walter Hickel appointed him to be the Alaska Attorney General. Retained by Hickel's successor, Tony Knowles, Botelho served as Attorney General for nearly nine years before retiring from state service. Early life and education Bruce M. Botelho was born in Juneau, Alaska, on October 6, 1948. He was raised in that city and in Anchorage, graduating from Juneau-Douglas High School in 1966, after which he attended school in Germany as an exchange student. He graduated from Willamette University in Salem, Oregon, with a Bachelor of Arts in German Literature in 1971. Botelho then went to law school and graduated from Willamette's School of Law with a Juris Doctorate in 1976. He also earned a ZP (Germanistik), at Ruprecht Karl Universit√§t in Heidelberg, Germany. He married the former Maria De Guadalupe Alvarez, known as Lupita, and they have two children, Alex and Adriana. Bruce is an accomplished international folk dancer. Early career During law school, Botelho clerked for the office of Oregon Legislative Counsel, the Oregon Law Improvement Commission and Alaska Supreme Court Justice Edmond Burke. Immediately following law school, in 1976 Botelho was appointed an assistant attorney general in the Alaska Department of Law, where he represented the departments of commerce and economic development and revenue. In 1978 he was promoted to section supervising attorney for the human services section which provided legal services to the departments of health and social services, labor and education. He served as counsel to the state board of education. In 1983 he was appointed deputy commissioner of the Alaska Department of Revenue, a position he held until May 1986. There he oversaw the state's tax programs, child support enforcement, permanent fund dividends, charitable gaming, and alcohol beverage control. Politics =Juneau Assembly and first mayoral term= Botelho began his political career in 1983 when he was elected to the City and Borough of Juneau Assembly. He was elected as mayor of Juneau in October 1988, serving until October 1991. =Alaska Attorney General= Botelho had returned to the Alaska Department of Law in mid-1987 as supervising attorney of the oil and gas section. In February 1992 he was appointed as deputy attorney general for Alaska. On January 12, 1994 he was appointed by Governor Walter J. Hickel as Attorney General and confirmed by the Alaska Legislature that May. In December 1994, Governor Hickel was succeeded by Tony Knowles, who asked Botelho to continue in office. He served until December 2002. As Attorney General, Botelho chaired the Criminal Justice Council and served as a trustee to the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation. He also chaired the Children's Confidentiality Task Force, the state team on state-tribal relations, the Governors Conference on Youth and Justice, and co- chaired the Criminal Justice Assessment Commission. He served as chief of staff for the Governor's Task Force on Civil Justice Reform and the Governor's Subsistence Task Force. He was an initial trustee of the Alaska Children's Trust. Major accomplishments of his tenure included oil and gas tax and royalty settlements in excess of $3 billion, settlement of the Alaska mental health lands trust litigation, lifting of the blockade of the Alaska state ferry Malaspina, Alaska's participation in the national tobacco litigation, natural resource and environmental protection actions against Tyson Seafood Group and Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, and reinvigorated antitrust enforcement including propane litigation and the Carrs-Safeway grocery and BP Amoco-Arco mergers.Past Attorney's General.

NA stands for Nucleic Acids (DNA, RNA, PNA) which start as a random pool, and are enriched through the selection process. Systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), also referred to as in vitro selection or in vitro evolution, is a combinatorial chemistry technique in molecular biology for producing oligonucleotides of either single-stranded DNA or RNA that specifically bind to a target ligand or ligands. These single-stranded DNA or RNA are commonly referred to as aptamers. Although SELEX has emerged as the most commonly used name for the procedure, some researchers have referred to it as SAAB (selected and amplified binding site) and CASTing (cyclic amplification and selection of targets) SELEX was first introduced in 1990. In 2015 a special issue was published in the Journal of Molecular Evolution in the honor of quarter century of the SELEX discovery. The process begins with the synthesis of a very large oligonucleotide library consisting of randomly generated sequences of fixed length flanked by constant 5' and 3' ends that serve as primers. For a randomly generated region of length n, the number of possible sequences in the library is 4n (n positions with four possibilities (A,T,C,G) at each position). The sequences in the library are exposed to the target ligand - which may be a protein or a small organic compound - and those that do not bind the target are removed, usually by affinity chromatography or target capture on paramagnetic beads. The bound sequences are eluted and amplified by PCR to prepare for subsequent rounds of selection in which the stringency of the elution conditions can be increased to identify the tightest-binding sequences. A caution to consider in this method is that the selection of extremely high, sub-nanomolar binding affinity entities may not in fact improve specificity for the target molecule. Off-target binding to related molecules could have significant clinical effects. SELEX has been used to develop a number of aptamers that bind targets interesting for both clinical and research purposes. Also towards these ends, a number of nucleotides with chemically modified sugars and bases have been incorporated into SELEX reactions. These modified nucleotides allow for the selection of aptamers with novel binding properties and potentially improved stability.  Procedure  Aptamers have emerged as a novel category in the field of bioreceptors due to their wide applications ranging from biosensing to therapeutics. Several variations of their screening process, called SELEX have been reported which can yield sequences with desired properties needed for their final use. = Generating single stranded oligonucleotide library = The first step of SELEX involves the synthesis of fully or partially randomized oligonucleotide sequences of some length flanked by defined regions which allow PCR amplification of those randomized regions and, in the case of RNA SELEX, in vitro transcription of the randomized sequence. While Ellington and Szostak demonstrated that chemical synthesis is capable of generating ~1015 unique sequences for oligonucleotide libraries in their 1990 paper on in vitro selection, they found that amplification of these synthesized oligonucleotides led to significant loss of pool diversity due to PCR bias and defects in synthesized fragments. The oligonucleotide pool is amplified and a sufficient amount of the initial library is added to the reaction so that there are numerous copies of each individual sequence to minimize the loss of potential binding sequences due to stochastic events. Before the library is introduced to target for incubation and selective retention, the sequence library must be converted to single stranded oligonucleotides to achieve structural conformations with target binding properties. = Target incubation = Immediately prior to target introduction, the single stranded oligonucleotide library is often heated and cooled slowly to renature oligonucleotides into thermodynamically stable secondary and tertiary structures. Once prepared, the randomized library is incubated with immobilized target to allow oligonucleotide-target binding. There are several considerations for this target incubation step, including the target immobilization method and strategies for subsequent unbound oligonucleotide separation, incubation time and temperature, incubation buffer conditions, and target versus oligonucleotide concentrations. Examples of target immobilization methods include affinity chromatography columns, nitrocellulose binding assay filters, and paramagnetic beads. Recently, SELEX reactions have been developed where the target is whole cells, which are expanded near complete confluence and incubated with the oligonucleotide library on culture plates. Incubation buffer conditions are altered based on the intended target and desired function of the selected aptamer. For example, in the case of negatively charged small molecules and proteins, high salt buffers are used for charge screening to allow nucleotides to approach the target and increase the chance of a specific binding event. Alternatively, if the desired aptamer function is in vivo protein or whole cell binding for potential therapeutic or diagnostic application, incubation buffer conditions similar to in vivo plasma salt concentrations and homeostatic temperatures are more likely to generate aptamers that can bind in vivo. Another consideration in incubation buffer conditions is non-specific competitors. If there is a high likelihood of non- specific oligonucleotide retention in the reaction conditions, non specific competitors, which are small molecules or polymers other than the SELEX library that have similar physical properties to the library oligonucleotides, can be used to occupy these non-specific binding sites. Varying the relative concentration of target and oligonucleotides can also affect properties of the selected aptamers. If a good binding affinity for the selected aptamer is not a concern, then an excess of target can be used to increase the probability that at least some sequences will bind during incubation and be retained. However, this provides no selective pressure for high binding affinity, which requires the oligonucleotide library to be in excess so that there is competition between unique sequences for available specific binding sites. = Binding sequence elution and amplification = Once the oligonucleotide library has been incubated with target for sufficient time, unbound oligonucleotides are washed away from immobilized target, often using the incubation buffer so that specifically bound oligonucleotides are retained. With unbound sequences washed away, the specifically bound sequences are then eluted by creating denaturing conditions that promote oligonucleotide unfolding or loss of binding conformation including flowing in deionized water, using denaturing solutions containing urea and EDTA, or by applying high heat and physical force. Upon elution of bound sequences, the retained oligonucleotides are reverse-transcribed to DNA in the case of RNA or modified base selections, or simply collected for amplification in the case of DNA SELEX. These DNA templates from eluted sequences are then amplified via PCR and converted to single stranded DNA, RNA, or modified base oligonucleotides, which are used as the initial input for the next round of selection. =Obtaining ssDNA= One of the most critical steps in the SELEX procedure is obtaining single stranded DNA (ssDNA) after the PCR amplification step. This will serve as input for the next cycle so it is of vital importance that all the DNA is single stranded and as little as possible is lost. Because of the relative simplicity, one of the most used methods is using biotinylated reverse primers in the amplification step, after which the complementary strands can be bound to a resin followed by elution of the other strand with lye. Another method is asymmetric PCR, where the amplification step is performed with an excess of forward primer and very little reverse primer, which leads to the production of more of the desired strand. A drawback of this method is that the product should be purified from double stranded DNA (dsDNA) and other left-over material from the PCR reaction. Enzymatic degradation of the unwanted strand can be performed by tagging this strand using a phosphate-probed primer, as it is recognized by enzymes such as Lambda exonuclease. These enzymes then selectively degrade the phosphate tagged strand leaving the complementary strand intact. All of these methods recover approximately 50 to 70% of the DNA. For a detailed comparison refer to the article by Svobodov√° et al. where these, and other, methods are experimentally compared. In classical SELEX, the process of randomized single stranded library generation, target incubation, and binding sequence elution and amplification described above are repeated until the vast majority of the retained pool consists of target binding sequences, though there are modifications and additions to the procedure that are often used, which are discussed below. = Negative or counter selection = In order to increase the specificity of aptamers selected by a given SELEX procedure, a negative selection, or counter selection, step can be added prior to or immediately following target incubation. To eliminate sequences with affinity for target immobilization matrix components from the pool, negative selection can be used where the library is incubated with target immobilization matrix components and unbound sequences are retained. Negative selection can also be used to eliminate sequences that bind target-like molecules or cells by incubating the oligonucleotide library with small molecule target analogs, undesired cell types, or non-target proteins and retaining the unbound sequences. = Tracking selection progression = To track the progress of a SELEX reaction, the number of target bound molecules, which is equivalent to the number of oligonucleotides eluted, can be compared to the estimated total input of oligonucleotides following elution at each round. The number of eluted oligonucleotides can be estimated through elution concentration estimations via 260 nm wavelength absorbance or fluorescent labeling of oligonucleotides. As the SELEX reaction approaches completion, the fraction of the oligonucleotide library that binds target approaches 100%, such that the number of eluted molecules approaches the total oligonucleotide input estimate, but may converge at a lower number. = Caveats and considerations = Some SELEX reactions can generate probes that are dependent on primer binding regions for secondary structure formation. There are aptamer applications for which a short sequence, and thus primer truncation, is desirable. An advancement on the original method allows an RNA library to omit the constant primer regions, which can be difficult to remove after the selection process because they stabilize secondary structures that are unstable when formed by the random region alone.  Chemically modified nucleotides  Recently, SELEX has expanded to include the use of chemically modified nucleotides. These chemically modified oligonucleotides offer many potential advantages for selected aptamers including greater stability and nuclease resistance, enhanced binding for select targets, expanded physical properties - like increased hydrophobicity, and more diverse structural conformations. The genetic alphabet, and thus possible aptamers, is also expanded using unnatural base pairs the use of these unnatural base pairs was applied to SELEX and high affinity DNA aptamers were generated.  Prior targets  The technique has been used to evolve aptamers of extremely high binding affinity to a variety of target ligands, including small molecules such as ATP and adenosine and proteins such as prions and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Moreover, SELEX has been used to select high-affinity aptamers for complex targets such as tumor cells. Clinical uses of the technique are suggested by aptamers that bind tumor markers, GFP-related fluorophores, and a VEGF-binding aptamer trade-named Macugen has been approved by the FDA for treatment of macular degeneration. Additionally, SELEX has been utilized to obtain highly specific catalytic DNA or DNAzymes. Several metal- specific DNAzymes have been reported including the GR-5 DNAzyme (lead- specific), the CA1-3 DNAzymes (copper-specific), the 39E DNAzyme (uranyl- specific) and the NaA43 DNAzyme (sodium-specific). These developed aptamers have seen diverse application in therapies for macular degeneration and various research applications including biosensors, fluorescent labeling of proteins and cells, and selective enzyme inhibition.

The political changes of Afghanistan have not allowed the cinema of the country to grow over the years. However, numerous Pashto and Dari films have been made both inside and outside Afghanistan throughout the 20th century. The cinema of Afghanistan entered a new phase in 2001. History Emir Habibullah Khan (reigned 1901‚Äì1919) introduced film to Afghanistan, but in the royal court only. In 1923-24, the first projector - \\"magic box\\" or \\"mageek lantan\\" (magic lantern) - showed the first silent film in Paghman to the public. The first Afghan film, \\"Love and Friendship\\", was produced in 1946. When the fledgling Afghan Film was opened in 1968 it produced documentaries and news films highlighting the official meetings and conferences of the government. All these films were shown in cinemas before feature films, which were usually from India. The first feature film made in Kabul by Afghan Film using Afghan artists was 'Like Eagles' starring Zahir Waida and a young girl named Najia. Soon after this Afghan Film made a three-part film with the collective title 'Ages', which comprised 'Smugglers', 'Suitors' and 'Friday Night'. Two other films from the same era are 'Village Tunes' and 'Difficult Days'. All of these films were shot in black and white. Film artists of this era included Khan Aqa Soroor, Rafeeq Saadiq, Azizullah Hadaf, Mashal Honaryar and Parvin Sanatgar. The first color films produced by Afghan Film in the early 1980s were 'Run Away' (Faraar), 'Love Epic' (Hamaasa e Ishg), 'Saboor Soldier'(Saboor Sarbaaz), 'Ash' (Khakestar), 'Last Wishes' (Akharin Arezo) and 'Migrating Birds' (Paranda Mohajer). These films, although not as technically proficient as those from abroad, struck a chord with Afghans because they mirrored their life. However, cinema was still seen only in the larger centres. During the late 1960s and 1970s Soviet aid included cultural training and scholarships were offered to students interested in studying film. However, since Afghanistan had no film academy, future filmmakers had to apprentice on the job. The civil wars of the 1990s were not conducive to creative work and many people working in the Afghan film industry escaped to Iran or Pakistan, where they were able to make videos for NGOs. When the Taliban took power in 1996, cinemas were attacked and many films were burnt. The Taliban forbade the viewing of television and films and cinemas were closed, either becoming tea shops or restaurants or falling into a state of disrepair. Habibullah Ali of Afghan Film hid thousands of films, buried underground or in hidden rooms, to prevent their destruction by the Taliban. Teardrops was the first post-Taliban film in 2002, and the first film since Oruj in 1995.lubbockonline.com/stories/052702/ent_0527020031.shtml On November 19, 2001, Bakhtar was the first cinema to re-open its doors, where thousands of people entered that day. =Afghan Film Organization= Afghan Film also known as Afghan Film Organization (AFO) is Afghanistan's state-run film company. It was established in 1968 and the current president is Sahraa Karimi, the first female head of the organisation. =Reemergence= Since 2001, the cinema of Afghanistan has slowly started to re-emerge from a lengthy period of silence. Before the September 11th attacks, Afghanistan-based Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf attracted world attention to Afghanistan with his celebrated movie, Kandahar. It was an attempt to tell the world about a forgotten country. The film brought the cinema of Afghanistan to the Cannes film festival for the first time in history. Later Samira Makhmalbaf, Siddiq Barmak, Razi Mohebi, Horace Shansab, Yassamin Maleknasr and Abolfazl Jalili made a significant contribution to Dari (Persian) cinema in Afghanistan. Barmak's first Persian/Pashtu film Osama (2003) won several awards at film festivals in Cannes and London. Siddiq Barmak is also director of the Afghan Children Education Movement (ACEM), an association that promotes literacy, culture and the arts, founded by Iranian film director Mohsen Makhmalbaf. The school trains actors and directors for the emerging cinema of Afghanistan. In 2006 Afghanistan joined the Central Asian and Southern Caucasus Film Festivals Confederation. In the 1970s and 1980s, it was not difficult to get women to act in films. The war and the Taliban rule changed the situation. Today women are increasingly represented in the cinema of Afghanistan. Talented actors like Leena Alam, Amina Jafari, Saba Sahar (now also a director) and Marina Gulbahari have emerged over the last decade. Apart from cinema in Persian, Pashto cinema is also flourishing in Afghanistan. Several Pashto language films have been made since the fall of the Taliban. Several Pashto films have been made by foreigners like Good Morning Afghanistan (2003) by Camilla Nielsson. =B-movies= There are a number of films produced both inside and outside Afghanistan that are considered B-movies due to the low production quality and audience reach. These films are targeted mainly at an Afghan audience and rarely make it to the non-Afghan audiences or the international film festivals.

There were 23 episodes aired at 25 minutes each. It is often mistakenly believed to be a spinoff of the earlier and more popular, series Attack No. 1 (1969-1971), due in part to the involvement of several staffers (including directors Kurokawa and Okabe and writer Yamazaki) who had worked on the prior series. It is not an official spinoff, and it is more likely to have been inspired by the popularity of Attack No. 1. It is also known in Europe as Smash (French) and Mimi e le ragazze della pallavolo (Italian). Original Story The story is about Mimi Hijiiri, a student with just one school year remaining, who decides to revitalize a volleyball team low on morale from the death of one of its team members from an accident.

This remarkable survivor of Cincinnati's period of settlement offers exhibits and programs that focus on Cincinnati history, historic preservation, and the built environment. In addition to be being a house museum, the Betts House is also the headquarters of The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in the State of Ohio.  History of the Betts House  = The Saga of the Betts Family = The Betts House, constructed in 1804, is the oldest brick home in Ohio and the oldest remaining residential structure in downtown Cincinnati. Originally situated on 111 acres, the home was once at the heart of a prosperous farm and brick yard. Over time, the idyllic country landscape surrounding the home transitioned to an urban environment as the city expanded. Today, the Betts House is a central structure in the Betts-Longworth Historic District in Cincinnati's West End neighborhood. leftIn 1795, the home's original owners, William and Phebe Betts left their home in Rahway, New Jersey to pursue better opportunities in the west. The first leg of their journey ended in Brownsville, Pennsylvania where the Betts lived for a number of years. In 1800, the family decided to resume their push westward on a flatboat travelling down the Ohio River. Upon arriving in the region, the Betts family attempted to obtain a plot of land in Lebanon; however, the deed proved to be faulty. They then struck out for Cincinnati. There William Betts obtained a 111-acre plot of land as repayment for a debt owed to him by a local tavern keeper. Construction quickly commenced on a modest, two-room Federal period farmhouse that was completed in 1804. Over the following decades, four generations of Betts family members called the Betts House home and raise over two dozen children within its walls. To accommodate the growing family, a number of changes had to be made to the original structure. Between 1804 and 1864, the house more than doubled in size. During this period of expansion, the city of Cincinnati was also growing at an exponential rate. What had once been quiet farmland quickly became an urban neighborhood. In 1833, the original 111-acre plot was subdivided when William's youngest daughter Eliza turned 21- as stipulated by his will in 1815. During this period, the surrounding area experienced rapid development. By 1839, the neighborhood was incorporated by the city of Cincinnati. Expansion continued at an explosive rate until nearly every plot of land was developed in the West End, and the population soared to an impressive density of 30,000 people per square mile. By the 1870s, the neighborhood had become overcrowded and aromatic due to its close proximity to the meat packing industry at Mill Creek. Many of the affluent residents, including the last of the Betts descendants, moved to the more fashionable hilltop suburbs, such as College Hill, during the following decades. = Decline and Decay = alt= The once densely populated West End suffered immensely from depopulation; however, it was not long before African Americans began to migrate to the neighborhood. By the beginning of the 20th-century, the area had become the cultural center for African Americans in Cincinnati and was a major source of nightlife entertainment. The famous Cotton Club, a jazz establishment, called the vibrant neighborhood home. Unfortunately, the prosperity did not last for long. By the 1950s, the city of Cincinnati was struggling as the population once again flocked to nearby suburbs. In an effort to revitalize the downtown area, the City Council devised a plan centered on highway construction. The Kenyon-Barr neighborhood, home to around 25,000 low-income people, was selected for the construction of I-75. Between the late 1950s and early 1960s, almost 1,000 structures were demolished in the name of ‚Äúurban renewal‚Äù leaving many of the neighborhood's African American residents without a place to call home. In the decades that followed, the West End fell into a state of decay. Many of its once stately homes, including the Betts House, lay vacant for much of the 1970s and 1980s when visions of a bustling Queensgate failed to come to fruition. = Martha Tuttle = In 1988, Martha Tuttle, a descendant of William Betts, created a coalition of concerned citizens in an effort to save her ancestral home. Thankfully, in 1990, they were able to secure the home and undertook a costly renovation to restore the property to livable condition. For several years following the renovation, the Betts House served as a small apartment complex. The National Society of Colonial Dames of America in the State of Ohio (NSCDA-OH) became the sole owners of the property in 1994. In 1996, the Betts House was opened to the public as a historic house museum with exhibits and programs focused on the built environment and early Cincinnati history. The home also serves as the headquarters for the NSCDA-OH.

The 90-108 MHz section was used for television for VHF channels 1, 2 and 3 until the analog shutdown occurred on July 24, 2011. The narrowness of the Japanese band (19 MHz compared to slightly more than 20 MHz for the CCIR band) limits the number of FM stations that can be accommodated on the dial. In late 2013, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications published a report proposing the expansion of the FM band to 95 MHz. Many stations that had been previously only available on the AM band were issued preliminary licenses to broadcast from 90-95 MHz. The first station to go on air in the expanded band was Nankai Broadcasting, which began test broadcasts on 91.7 FM on November 3, 2014. Receiver issues Many Japanese radios are designed to be capable of receiving both the Japanese FM band and the CCIR FM band, so that the same model can be sold within Japan or exported. The radio may cover 76 to 108 MHz, the frequency coverage may be selectable by the user, or during assembly the radio may be set to operate on one band by means of a specially-placed diode or other internal component. Conventional analog-tuned (dial & pointer) radios may be marked with \\"TV Sound\\" in the 90-108 section. If these radios were sold in the US, for example, the 76-88 section would be marked TV sound for VHF channels 5 and 6, with the 88-108 section band as audio FM. =Used automobile resale issues= Second-hand automobiles imported from Japan contain a radio designed for the Japanese FM band, and importers often fit a \\"converter\\" to down-convert the 87.5 - 108.0 MHz band to the frequencies that the radio can accept. In addition to showing an incorrect frequency, there are two other disadvantages that can result in undesired performance; the converter cannot down-convert in full the regular international FM band (up to 20.5 MHz wide) to the only 14 MHz wide Japanese band (unless the converter incorporates two user-switchable down-convert modes), and the original antenna may perform poorly on the higher FM band. Another problem is that RDS is not used in Japan, whereas most modern car radios available in Europe use this system. Also the converter may not allow pass-through of the MW band (if desired). A better solution is to replace the radio and antenna with ones designed for the country where the car will be used, but this can be difficult where custom- built radios are fitted.

The early years (1963‚Äì77) John Beradino's Steve Hardy and Roy Thinnes' Phil Brewer (pictured) were two of the leading male characters in General Hospital's original cast. General Hospital was created by Frank and Doris Hursley and premiered on April 1, 1963. The first stories were mainly set on the seventh floor of General Hospital, in an unnamed midsized Eastern city (the name of the city, Port Charles, would not be mentioned until the late 1970s). \\"They had this concept of the show that it was like a big wagon wheel ‚Äì the spokes would be the characters and the hub would be the hospital,\\" John Beradino (Steve Hardy) later reflected to Entertainment Weekly in 1994. Storylines revolved around Dr. Steve Hardy and his friend, Nurse Jessie Brewer (Emily McLaughlin). Steve was Chief of Internal Medicine and extremely dedicated to his work. Jessie's turbulent marriage to the much-younger Dr. Phil Brewer (originally portrayed by Roy Thinnes; lastly by Martin West) was the center of many early storylines. In 1964, Audrey March (Rachel Ames), a former flight attendant and the sister of Nurse Lucille March (Lucille Wall), joined the canvas and started a relationship with Steve. Other notable nurses during the 1960s and 1970s included Meg Bentley (Patricia Breslin, later Elizabeth MacRae), Diana Taylor (Valerie Starrett, later Brooke Bundy), Sharon McGillis (Sharon DeBord) and Jane Harland (Shelby Hiatt). Meg marries Lee Baldwin (Ross Elliott, later Peter Hansen), who adopts her son Scotty and becomes his only family when Meg dies. Diana is torn between two men, Dr. Peter Taylor (Paul Carr, later Craig Huebing) and Dr. Phil Brewer. Sharon marries Dr. Henry Pinkham (Peter Kilman) while Jane marries Howie Dawson (Ray Girardin). In one fast-paced plot in 1971, Audrey is accused of murdering her son's babysitter and General Hospital was briefly elevated to the number one position, beating longtime ratings giant As the World Turns. In 1972, Howie Dawson becomes involved with Brooke Clinton (then Indus Arthur), who is found murdered the day after she spurns his advances. In 1973, Audrey marries alcoholic Dr. Jim Hobart (James Sikking) before finally realizing she loves Steve. Augusta McLeod (Judith McConnell) arrives the same year, bringing back Phil Brewer in an attempt to break up Peter and Diana Taylor. Augusta is pregnant with Peter's child. In December 1974, Phil Brewer is murdered with a geode paper weight and Jessie Brewer is put on trial. She is acquitted and Augusta is sent to prison and gives her son up for adoption. Having been rated No. 1 in 1972, by the mid-1970s, viewers of General Hospital felt it to be glacially paced and the show was low-rated. Due to relatively easygoing choices in storyline, the show almost always lost out to rival medical soap The Doctors on NBC, which was considered by many to be more daring. TIME magazine panned General Hospital in 1976, stating, \\"If malpractice is this dull, it is worth insuring against,\\" noting the serial's saving grace was Dr. Lesley Williams (Denise Alexander). The introduction of actress Leslie Charleson (Monica Webber, later Monica Quartermaine) and actor Kin Shriner (Scott Baldwin) were also credited with aiding the show's revival. With cancellation looming, Douglas Marland was brought on as head writer. Marland is credited for creating longtime staples such as the Quartermaine and the Spencer families. When he objected to a planned storyline that called for the virtuous Dr. Lesley Webber to cheat on her husband with David Hamilton, Marland was challenged to come up with a better idea. As a result, Lesley rejected David's advances and the enraged suitor began sleeping with her sixteen-year-old daughter Laura Webber (Genie Francis) instead. This torrid affair culminated in Laura killing her older lover after discovering that he was only using her to get back at her mother. This storyline was successful and as a result, Laura became a major focus of the show. Laura's subsequent storyline, a love triangle involving her, Scott Baldwin, and Bobbie Spencer, was also a success, but soon the success of both stories would be overshadowed by a phenomenon that very few expected, when Laura crossed paths with Bobbie's brother Luke Spencer (Anthony Geary). Cultural phenomenon and supercouple pairings (1978‚Äì87) Faced with threats of cancellation in 1978 after several years of stagnant ratings, ABC Daytime executives brought on Gloria Monty as Executive Producer and gave her 13 weeks to increase ratings. Monty had much experience in the genre from directing The Secret Storm for years. Monty is credited with increasing the pacing of the series, and introducing action adventure storylines, which General Hospital was first among soap operas to do. Reportedly not agreeing with the increased pace and also not wanting to relocate to Los Angeles, California where GH was produced, Marland left the series and was replaced by Pat Falken Smith. The introduction of the WSB spy agent Robert Scorpio (and later fellow agents Sean Donely (John Reilly) and Anna Devane (Finola Hughes)) led to several popular spy mysteries involving secret formulas, hidden treasures and world domination schemes. A few of these plots were considered preposterous, such as the 1981 storyline in which Luke, Laura and Robert saved the town of Port Charles from being placed under a deep freeze by maniacal Mikkos Cassadine's Ice Princess weather machine. General Hospital bounced back from the brink and subsequently became the highest-rated American soap opera from the 1979/80 season until 1988 when they tied with The Young and the Restless. The supercouple pairing of Luke Spencer and Laura Webber would eventually become the most popular storyline in soap opera history. Their November 16‚Äì17, 1981 wedding was watched by about 30 million viewers, setting a record for the highest-rated episode of a soap opera in American television history. Their popularity got the attention of Elizabeth Taylor, who asked to be a part of the wedding. She guest-starred as Helena Cassadine and adorned Newsweek magazine with Francis and Geary. Rumors circulated that the wedding was not planned until Taylor asked for them to be married as part of her appearance, confirmed by head writer Pat Falken Smith as she left the series. Luke and Laura's relationship was not without some controversy, as Luke had raped her in 1979. Laura was traumatized and went to counseling, and eventually forgave Luke. Monty's comment on the storyline, as The New York Times quoted from a prior 1987 interview, \\"Some people call it a rape ‚Äì we call it a seduction.\\" Just before the wedding aired, head writer Pat Falken Smith and her team of writers angrily quit the show in August 1981 after repeated battles with Gloria Monty and ABC Daytime chief at the time Jacqueline Smith. Pat Falken Smith was also upset over the work done during her three-month absence during the writer's strike earlier in the year, claiming the Ice Princess storyline written while she was gone was, \\"the most convoluted, insipid, insane... crappy idea in the world.\\" In the plot, Smith's team left and went to NBC's Days of Our Lives. \\"Gloria's a genius‚Äîwho runs a Gestapo operation,\\" sniped Falken Smith in a 1981 People Weekly interview. During summer 1981, GH was averaging 14 million viewers per episode. The success of Luke and Laura led General Hospital and other soap operas to try and emulate the formula. Under the reign of Monty, the series produced other successful pairings such as Robert Scorpio and Holly Sutton (Tristan Rogers and Emma Samms), Duke Lavery and Anna Devane (Ian Buchanan and Finola Hughes) and Frisco Jones and Felicia Jones (Jack Wagner and Kristina Wagner). Exits of major characters like Luke and Laura, Heather Webber, Scott Baldwin and Dr. Lesley Webber helped contribute to falling ratings, although new characters brought in new fans to make up for those losses. Emily McLaughlin reduced the number of her appearances during this time due to weakening health but remained a strong presence when she did appear. Veteran actors like Peter Hansen and Susan Brown departed, although they would return on a recurring basis and later helped launch the 1997-2002 spin-off, Port Charles. But fans continue to bemoan the fact that others like Frank Maxwell, Todd Davis and Bianca Ferguson would not return after their late 80's exits, having contributed greatly to the show's supporting cast during its heyday. Lynn Herring was cast as a sexy new vamp, Lucy Coe, bringing both humor and scandal to her role of the husband-stealing character who briefly had a family written in around her thanks to her Aunt Charlene Maree Cheatham and Charlene's two sons. The series also launched the media career of fitness instructor Richard Simmons, who frequently appeared as himself on the show who was a fitness instructor that taught an aerobics class at the town's trendy nightclub at the time during the morning hours, The Campus Disco. The transition (1988‚Äì91) As Gloria Monty left in 1987, General Hospital entered a transitional phase as the action/adventure storylines of the 1980s became less popular. H. Wesley Kenney took over as executive producer in January 1987, and for a while into his tenure, the show still capitalized on the action success of the past few years. In an interview with the Associated Press, Kenney said: Bringing back the mob in the mid 1980s set \\"GH\\" in a tone it has never fallen back from. The introduction of Duke Lavery (Ian Buchanan) brought on several new mobsters including the mysterious \\"Mr. Big\\" who turned out to be none other than police chief Bert Ramsey, as well as the Jerome family. Years later, when Duke was brought back from the dead, the new writers would re-introduce the Jeromes to match wits and automatic rifles with Sonny Corinthos just as the writers had done years before with the Cassadine family. The show took a different turn when Joseph Hardy took over in 1989. In one far-fetched storyline in 1990, Robin Scorpio (Robert Scorpio and Anna Devane's daughter) befriended Casey Rogers, an alien from the planet Lumina. The show's ratings fluctuated; Leslie Charleson (Monica Quartermaine) later explained to the Chicago Tribune: \\"It seemed every year we were getting a new producer who brought in new writers. The writers wouldn't do their homework, then they'd tell us, 'Make it work.'\\" In 1991, Gloria Monty was brought back to the series in an attempt to increase ratings. Not long after, the show lost major stars such as Finola Hughes (Anna Devane) and Tristan Rogers (Robert Scorpio). Anna and Robert had recently been reunited after having both been part of successful supercouples for the bulk of the 1980s. Although at the time some viewers felt the coupling odd, since they had spent the past decade as platonic friends, their reunion gave them a supercouple name for themselves. Hughes' departure was amidst rumors of Monty firing her, angry she had exercised her option to pursue prime time opportunities. Others however, said Hughes herself opted out early from her contract entirely. Rogers reportedly left due to unmet salary negotiations. The much-heralded return of Anthony Geary as Luke Spencer's lookalike cousin Bill Eckert in 1991 was also not well received. Monty was fired in late 1991. While ABC declined to comment, a representative from another ABC soap was quoted: \\"She was hired [in 1991] to take the show from No. 2 to No.1, and instead she made it No. 7.\\" Some credited the decline in ratings to Monty's focus on male characters, leaving the mostly-female audience without characters to identify with. Monty was also criticized for using General Hospital as a platform for a new series she was working on with ABC. Marla Hart of the Chicago Tribune described Monty's second stint: \\"She abandoned the soap's most endearing stories, inelegantly dismissed actors and introduced characters from out of the blue, until GH became one long non sequitur.\\" Era of \\"womansense\\" (1992‚Äì2000) Wendy Riche came aboard as executive producer in 1992, at a time when the series was struggling. She told Entertainment Weekly: \\"I will say that the show needed to be more character-driven rather than plot-driven. It needed to be more relatable in its story pursuit. It needed to balance fantasy and reality better. And it needed more romance.\\" Riche hired Claire Labine as head writer in 1993. Both were said to bring General Hospital into an era of \\"womansense\\". Under their reign, the series returned to medical focus and gained critical acclaim for its sensitive handling of social issues. Labine stated Riche said her first concern was bringing more depth to the characters, and making their family members seen, something the audience could relate to. She stated, \\"That‚Äôs why we created the Karen/Jagger/Brenda triangle. To get some new young characters into the show who could relate to the adults, or who would be tied to the adults. That was a priority as well as getting the main characters back on track, like Luke and Bobbie.\\" In 1993, Anthony Geary reprised his famous role of Luke Spencer, along with Genie Francis as Luke's wife Laura Spencer and the addition of their ten-year-old son, Lucky Spencer, played by newcomer Jonathan Jackson. In 1994, Geary and Francis were invited to appear on an episode of Roseanne, as Luke and Laura, as Roseanne was a fan of the show. The couple raced through her house on the run. In return, Roseanne and her then husband, Tom Arnold were invited for a guest spot on General Hospital. Roseanne portrayed Jennifer Smith, Luke's ex-girlfriend and daughter of mob boss Frank Smith. With the addition of Sonny Corinthos, played by Maurice Benard, in 1993, he was soon paired with Brenda, enticing viewers throughout the 1990s and reaching supercouple status. Labine credited the chemistry between Benard and Marcil as the reasoning behind the quick coupling. They were later involved in multiple love triangles, first with Sonny's eventual first wife Lily Rivera and teen heartthrob Miguel Morez starting in 1995, and later with corporate raider Jasper Jacks (Ingo Rademacher) after he joined the show in 1996. April 1994 marked the first annual Nurses' Ball, a fundraiser for HIV and AIDS awareness both within the storyline and in real life. Lucy Coe, played by Lynn Herring, founded the event. There was significant social impact, one reason being the current status of the disease. Herring recalled in a 2001 interview with USA Today, \\"Looking back on the early days of the Nurses Ball, we all remember what it was like for people with HIV or AIDS in the early '90s, and it wasn't very encouraging. We all knew people who had died or were dying from the disease, [in the days before protease inhibitors and anti-viral 'cocktails'] compassion was about all we had to offer, but it was sometimes in short supply.\\" The story featured the NAMES Project AIDS Memorial Quilt, as well as coincided with the Day of Compassion, an annual day where all participating soap operas featured HIV or AIDS related topics. May 1994 started the historic story arc detailing a heart transplant involving the death of eight-year-old daughter of Tony Jones and Bobbie Spencer, in a bus crash, and the subsequent donation of her heart to her dying cousin Maxie Jones. Later that year, Dr. Monica Quartermaine (Leslie Charleson) begins a long battle with breast cancer, which leads to her adopting Emily Bowen, the young daughter of Paige Bowen, who Monica befriends during treatment. The mid 1990s saw declining ratings. All soaps lost ground at this time, one reason being the O.J. Simpson trial, which pre-empted an entire week in the summer of 1994, a loss that was hard to recover. Between January and May 1995, General Hospital lost ten percent of viewership. General Hospital faced scrutiny for attempting ratings with story arcs TIME magazine called \\"morbid, publicity-conscious social relevance,\\" including the recently announced HIV story involving Robin Scorpio and Stone Cates. In a 2010 interview, Riche recalls regretting having announced the story ahead of time, saying she thought \\"we'd made a big mistake by announcing it. We did a big press conference/announcement, and approximately 100,000 viewers tuned out almost immediately. (...) those 100,000 might still be watching today. If we had weaned them into it they might have stayed around to see what happens, and gotten involved in the story and stayed with it. (...) I imagine some tuned out because they thought it would be depressing when ultimately, thanks to Claire and her team, it was uplifting. So had we just let the storytelling play, I think we would have retained the audience.\\" Reception on the social storylines was positive; in April 1995, Marla Hart of the Chicago Tribune deemed General Hospital as saving the soap genre. She described head writer Labine's impact: \\"Labine resuscitated the careers of many veteran ensemble players on this soap, forsaking the hunk and babe ratings game. And simply by being so bold in the 1990s as to give viewers storylines that pack an emotional wallop, Labine did what no one else in daytime is doing right now: returning soap to its core of drama. While the other soaps bend to sponsor pressure or obsess on producers' personal agendas, 'General Hospital' is keeping this ailing genre alive.\\" The series won its third Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series that year. The previously announced HIV story unfolded, and was praised for the tragic love story of teenagers Stone Cates (Michael Sutton) and Robin Scorpio (Kimberly McCullough). Riche stated she had been wanting to do an AIDS story since joining the series, and prior to Labine's start, Riche had initially considered for the character that would contract the disease. A.J., already prone to wild behavior, would party with a male friend who had AIDS, and would not \\"remember who had sex with who, and what he did during so many drunken orgies.\\" However, A.J. was also part of the white-collar Quartermaine family, and the network disapproved in letting the story turn that way. Riche also agreed with the network to some extent, in that she wanted the impact to stay focused on responsible sex and not sidetracked with homosexuality concerns: When Labine had joined the regime, she proposed the idea of Robin and Stone for the story, and by this time was ready to bring it to fruition. After a struggle that lasted throughout most of 1995, Stone dies from AIDS in November at the age of 19, and his death is followed by a fallout in which 17-year-old Robin has to cope with being HIV-positive herself. Sutton received a nomination for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, and McCullough won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series. In 1998, the series revisited Luke's long ago rape of his now-wife Laura, something associate head writer Michele Val Jean had been thinking of since joining the show in 1991. Val Jean, who had been raped herself at the age of twelve, used her own experiences to bring authenticity to the story. The Luke and Laura rape-turned-seduction had always bothered her, Val Jean said, \\"I knew what I had seen on the screen, and it wasn't seduction.\\" The series, that had turned perception this way after facing pressure from the numerous fans of supercouple Luke and Laura, now acknowledged Luke's actions as date rape without romanticization. In an interview with the Associated Press, Executive Producer Wendy Riche explained, \\"The times are different. What the audience perceives and what they expect is very different from what it was 20 years ago. They are more conscious date rape is unacceptable.\\" However, she also clarified, \\"We didn't approach it as 'let's make amends.' We didn't feel guilty or felt like we had to.\\" Riche ended by saying the ultimate message for the story was that, \\"It was not acceptable then, no matter what the town said or the press said. It is not acceptable to take control over another person's body under any circumstance.\\" The story brought up the subject by using Luke and Laura's son, Lucky (Jonathan Jackson), and his soon-to-be love interest Elizabeth Webber, played by Rebecca Herbst. Lucky finds Elizabeth, a victim of rape, beaten and bruised in a park in February 1998. He subsequently finds out from his newfound half- brother, Nikolas Cassadine (Tyler Christopher) that Luke had raped Laura. Pat Fili-Krushel, then President of Daytime Programming for ABC Daytime, explained, \\"What we felt we should investigate is how, as the famous saying goes, the sins of the father are visited on the children.\\" Head writer at the time Robert Guza, Jr. commented: Anthony Geary delivered a nine-minute monologue, without commercial interruption, as Luke tells Lucky about the night of Laura's rape. The revelation drives a wedge between Lucky and Nikolas, and such a wedge between Lucky and Luke that Lucky moves out of the house. The storyline won Daytime Emmy Awards for Jackson, Geary, the writers, the directors, and the show. Riche helped bring the long-rumored spin-off (which was tentatively titled GH2) to fruition in 1997, which became the half- hour soap Port Charles. Guza, a former GH script writer, and head writer in 1996, came and went several times during December 1997 through December 2000. Guza was credited with shifting the focus of the series heavily towards storylines on organized crime, as well as mob kingpin character Sonny Corinthos. Meanwhile, ratings for all soap operas continued to drop. In 1998, viewership was down twenty percent from 1992, and between 1996 and 1998 each New York show had replaced its head writer and executive producer, some more than once. \\"It is almost as if the soap business is becoming a soap opera itself,\\" said Edward Lewine of The New York Times, in an article where he quoted Michael Logan of TV Guide, who added, \\"The audience is gradually eroding. Everybody is panicked, and the result is a constantly revolving door of writers and executives.\\" With the departure of Sonny's love interest Brenda as Vanessa Marcil left in 1998, Sonny's romantic pairings did not take off until the coupling of Sonny and Carly towards the turn of the century. Carly Benson (originated by Sarah Brown), had been in town since 1996, making grand gestures to make her birth mother, Bobbie Spencer's, life miserable. In 1999, writer Patrick Mulcahey had admitted the writers were not sure which direction Carly was going in. Brown and Benard proved to have chemistry when tested on- screen, and their couple would propel them into supercouple status in the coming decade. New millennium, mob era (2001‚Äì11) =2001‚Äì04= In 2001, Wendy Riche left the program after nine years as executive producer, later recalling: Riche was replaced by Jill Farren Phelps. During the first few months of her tenure, a number of \\"dark\\" storylines took place which earned a negative reaction for Phelps and new head writer Megan McTavish. In the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, ABC executives ordered less violence and warfare, causing rewrites and plot abandonments. One story, dubbed \\"Endgame,\\" involved the culmination of the feud between the Spencer family and Cassadine family, a storyline which had begun in 1981 when Luke and Laura infamously defeated Mikkos Cassadine's weather machine. In the revival storyline, Helena Cassadine revives her deceased son Stavros Cassadine, who had been frozen through the use of cryogenics. The original script had Helena threaten the Spencers along with the rest of Port Charles with a biotoxin, which was quickly deemed inappropriate and dropped. In 2001, Sarah Brown left the show and was replaced by Tamara Braun, however the coupling of Sonny and Carly remained popular. Original supercouple Luke and Laura finalize their divorce in 2001, meanwhile a bus accident that disrupted the Nurses Ball, an on-screen and real-life fundraiser for AIDS research. This marked the end of the annual event, that had been running since 1994, for the time being. General Hospital aired its 10,000th episode on April 17, 2002, with an episode that revolved around the show's longest-running cast member, Rachel Ames. The episode commemorated her character Audrey March Hardy, celebrating her 10,000th shift as a nurse at the hospital. The episode was notable for showcasing the show's long history in a series of clips and montages. Negative response to the series was seen in 2002 with the abrupt departure of Genie Francis (who plays Laura Spencer) due to contract negotiations. To facilitate Francis's exit, Laura kills her stepfather Rick Webber, leading to her mental breakdown and state of catatonia. Francis told USA Today, \\"I am not comfortable with the way it ended at all. They destroyed Laura.\\" However, ratings remained stable after Francis's departure and climbed when Vanessa Marcil returned as Brenda Barrett in a five-month stint which lasted into the early months of 2003. Also in 2003, fan favorite character Tracy Quartermaine returned with her now teenaged son Dillon Quartermaine. From 2003 to 2004, many long tenured cast members were taken off contract. In 2003, Rachel Ames, the longest-running character after more than 35 years, was taken off contract and put on recurring status. Around the same time, Brad Maule, who played Tony Jones, and Shell Kepler, who played Amy Vining, were also moved to recurring status. Also in 2003, Anna Lee was moved to recurring status after 25 years as Lila Quartermaine. During the same time, John Ingle, who played Lila's husband Edward Quartermaine, was fired from the show. The producers soon rescinded their decision and asked him to stay on a recurring status, but Ingle had accepted the role of Mickey Horton on Days of Our Lives, and Edward was recast with Jed Allan. Kin Shriner was also let go, who had been with the show on and off since 1977. Other popular characters, such as Bobbie Spencer (Jacklyn Zeman) and Felicia Jones (Kristina Wagner) also began to see less screentime. As the series dropped to number four, it continued to be known for violent storylines, often focused on organized crime. 2004 marked the beginning of the series' month-long sweeps storylines. That February, the Port Charles Hotel Fire story saw the cast trapped in the burning hotel, including a location shoot involving a helicopter. During the ordeal, Edward suffers a heart attack, Courtney rescues a lady who later rewards her with large sums of money, and Scott Baldwin is presumed dead. That summer, while the 2004 Summer Olympics were screening on rival channel NBC, the show launched another major storyline that involved a masked serial killer terrorizing the Quartermaine mansion for five episodes. The storyline was seen as an attempt to lure NBC soap opera viewers, especially due to the similarities to the recent serial killer storyline that had taken place on rival NBC soap Days of Our Lives. In General Hospitals version, the killer is revealed to be Mary Bishop, attempting to kill Emily Quartermaine but killing Sage Alcazar instead. Mary is the widow of Nikolas's doppelg√§nger Connor, who tries to convinces Nikolas that he is actually her husband while he's experiencing amnesia. Emily tries to make him see the truth, causing Mary's rampage. The confrontation ends with Nikolas shooting Mary, who later dies in the hospital when her medications are switched by Lorenzo Alcazar, seeking revenge for the death of his niece Sage. The year ends with the wedding of Emily and Nikolas. =2005‚Äì06= The first half of 2005 saw many cast changes for General Hospital. In April, Tamara Braun left the series, and the role of Carly was recast with former One Life to Live star, Jennifer Bransford. By the fall, Bransford was let go and replaced by former Guiding Light actress Laura Wright. Earlier that May, Kristina Wagner opted to leave the role of Felicia Jones and was replaced with former Another World star Sandra Ferguson. Also that month, the character of Maxie Jones was recast with former Days of Our Lives star Kirsten Storms, who took over for Robyn Richards, the main portrayer of Maxie since 1993. The character was slightly aged and introduced in a revisit to the 1994 heart transplant story as Maxie's health falls near-death. 2005 also saw the continued decline in ratings, leading to budget cuts and product placement advertising across all soaps. In February 2005 it was reported that General Hospital viewership was down 23% year-over-year. In early 2005, Michael Corinthos and his siblings are kidnapped, and Michael's death is faked by his biological father A. J. Quartermaine. The story culminates in what appears to be Michael murdering his father, until Dr. Asher Thomas is revealed to be the apparent killer. Also in 2005, Nikolas Cassadine's doppelg√§nger Connor Bishop rapes Nikolas' wife Emily, eventually contributing to their divorce. Nikolas gets involved with Courtney Matthews, who is in the midst of a shaky marriage with Jasper Jacks, and they conceive a child. In October 2005, Lucas Jones, played by Ben Hogestyn, began to announce his homosexuality to his friends and family, but the storyline was ultimately dropped when Hogestyn left the series and the character was written off. The November sweeps involved a large train wreck, and was the first story for Laura Wright as Carly. At the same time Kimberly McCullough reprised her role as Robin Scorpio, bringing along 1980s character Dr. Noah Drake, played by Rick Springfield, on a recurring status. Robin is soon romantically paired with Noah's son Patrick Drake, played by newcomer Jason Thompson. The following February sweeps saw General Hospital quarantined due to an encephalitis virus outbreak. While the virus killed off long-time character Tony Jones (Brad Maule) and Courtney Matthews (Alicia Leigh Willis). other veteran characters made guest appearances that year. The story briefly brought back Robert Scorpio, played by Tristan Rogers, who reunites with his daughter Robin after years of being presumed dead. Anna Devane (Finola Hughes) returned in May for the first of several brief guest stints. In the summer of 2006, the series focused on the issue of unplanned pregnancy and featured Lulu Spencer (Julie Marie Berman)'s decision to have an abortion. The show worked closely with the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy to make the dialogue realistic, and the storyline saw ratings rise in female teenagers. In November, Genie Francis reprised Laura Spencer for the November sweeps; the character temporarily awakened from her catatonic state for an emotional reunion with her family. Laura and Luke Spencer remarry on the 25th anniversary of their 1981 historic wedding before Laura returns to catatonia. Francis won her first Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for this performance. =2007‚Äì08= The February 2007 sweeps had a 24-style theme that took place in real time over 16 hour- long episodes. \\"James Craig\\" and a team of masked gunmen invade the Metro Court Hotel and hold everyone hostage, in an effort to steal a briefcase from the hotel's vault. He torments the hostages with a series of deadly games: Robin Scorpio is shot and Emily Quartermaine and Carly Corinthos are forced to perform makeshift surgery on her, while Alan Quartermaine, suffers a heart attack. Craig detonates explosives, managing to escape in the confusion. Jason is caught in an elevator with Elizabeth Webber and learns he is the father of her unborn baby. The storyline ends with the death of Alan Quartermaine following complications from his untreated heart attack, and Stuart was set to be fired. A veteran character since the 1970s, the character was written back on in a recurring status, appearing as his sister Tracy Quartermaine's conscience. Robin and Patrick's courtship continues, touching on her HIV- positive status and responsible sex, and leading up to Patrick's HIV scare after being cut while operating on a patient with AIDS. The story arc won General Hospital first place at the Sentinel for Health Awards in 2007. The series also won second place for Nancy Lee Grahn's performance as Alexis Davis battling lung cancer. In September 2007, the Corinthos/Jacks nanny Leticia Juarez is the victim of a serial killer. In November, Nikolas Cassadine throws a Black and White Ball for his fianc√©e Emily Quartermaine, where both the killer and Anthony Zacchara wreak havoc. Emily is strangled to death by the newly dubbed Text Message Killer (\\"TMK\\"). In December, Georgie Jones is the next victim; afterwards her cousin Robin seeks comfort from ex-boyfriend Patrick, resulting in her pregnancy, the first HIV-related pregnancy for daytime. The TMK storyline carries on into 2008 as the killer hangs Cooper Barrett, then attacks and later kidnaps Sam McCall. It is revealed that presumed-dead Diego Alcazar is the killer, who accidentally hangs himself in the culminating confrontation. By 2008, General Hospitals reputation for mob violence was still strong. During the serial killer's rampage, son of mob kingpin Sonny, Michael Corinthos, purchases a gun to protect his family, and accidentally shoots Kate Howard, Sonny's girlfriend. Sonny tries to show Michael a life without mob violence, but Michael is shot by Ian Devlin in a plan orchestrated by Claudia Zacchara, with a bullet meant for Sonny. Head writer Robert Guza, Jr. addressed the shooting as his way of showing consequences for Michael's earlier actions, which had gone unaccounted for. Michael falls into a permanent coma as young actor Dylan Cash is let go from the series. When asked if showing consequences for violence was the beginning of less-violent plots on the show, Guza responded: Meanwhile, Lulu Spencer accidentally kills Logan Hayes in self-defense, and her boyfriend Johnny Zacchara promptly takes the blame for her. They go on the run, but Lulu soon begins to break down over her guilt. She goes to get treatment, and is shocked to find her mother Laura awake at the institution. After briefly being kidnapped by Scott Baldwin, Laura leaves to receive treatment in France, and Lulu recovers and is released. At the end of 2008, Sonny marries Claudia in an attempt to get back into the organization. Robin and Patrick also marry; their first wedding is interrupted when Robin gives birth to daughter Emma Drake, and they are finally married the day after Christmas. =2009‚Äì10= In the January 2009 sweeps, the hospital is quarantined after one of five toxic spheres detonate during surgery, followed by an anesthesia tank exploding, causing a fire that burns down hospital. The story is used to account for the new hospital set built for the show. Natalia Livingston, previously Emily Quartermaine, returned during this time as Rebecca Shaw, later to be found as Emily's twin sister sold at birth. Ethan Lovett also arrives, later proven to be the son of Holly Sutton and Luke Spencer. In April, Robin Scorpio suffers from postpartum depression. In May, a SORAS teenaged recast Michael Corinthos (now Drew Garrett) wakes up from coma after an experimental surgery, experiencing anger issues. Similarly aged characters Kristina Davis (now Lexi Ainsworth) and Morgan Corinthos are recast as well. A car driven by Edward Quartermaine crashes into the hospital carnival, wreaking havoc. Both Michael and Kristina think they cause an accident that results in their now-stepmother Claudia Zacchara losing her baby, and run off to Mexico. Jason Morgan and Sam find them, rekindling their relationship during the trip. Sonny finds out Claudia was responsible for Michael getting shot, and publicly verbally abuses her, leading to her kidnapping Carly Corinthos, causing Carly to go into labor. Michael ends up finding them, and accidentally killing Claudia to save Carly and his baby sister Josslyn. At the end of 2009, crazed artist Robert 'Franco' Frank (played by actor James Franco), comes to town and is shown to be obsessed with Jason Morgan. He kidnaps Sam, Lulu and Carly, who are saved shortly before he leaves town.

Remodeling and resurgence (2012‚Äìpresent) By early 2012, both other ABC Daytime soap operas had been cancelled, All My Children ending in September 2011, and One Life to Live's scheduled final air date on January 13, 2012. On January 9, 2012, former One Life To Live executive producer Frank Valentini officially replaced Jill Farren Phelps as the executive producer of General Hospital, while former OLTL head writer Ron Carlivati replaced Garin Wolf and Shelly Altman as head writers, who were both demoted to part of the back-up writing staff before being eventually fired from the show later that year. They had previously been hired as co-head writers replacing Bob Guza during the late summer and fall of 2011. Prior to joining GH, Valentini and Carlivati helped wrap up OLTL after its cancellation and subsequent transition to Prospect Park's online venture failed to happen. In the wake of the other cancelled series on ABC, and the low ratings of General Hospital itself, there was speculation that the new regime was an attempt by the network to save General Hospital from the same fate, some comparing it to the hiring of Gloria Monty in 1978. The change in staff occurred amidst key story arcs. In January 2012, Sam learns she is pregnant with either Jason or Franco's child. Jason kills Franco, in James Franco's last guest appearance, and Sam learns that Jason and Franco are twins and Franco is the father of her baby. There were two major February sweeps events. The first was the death of Robin Scorpio- Drake, played by Kimberly McCullough on and off since 1985, who had chosen to leave to pursue directing opportunities. Robin dies in a lab explosion, and Valentini received praise for bringing high-profile legacy characters back in the fallout, such as Anna Devane (Finola Hughes), Robert Scorpio (Tristan Rogers) and Holly Sutton (Emma Samms). New head writer Ron Carlivati took the writing over the day after the explosion, immediately turning the story around. He explained, \\"In the overall general landscape of daytime, with these shows going off the air and soap fans feeling so lost and disenfranchised and giving up hope for their shows, I wanted there to [be] hope that this was not the end of Robin‚Äôs story.\\" A few months later, it is revealed that Robin is alive and being held captive at an undisclosed location. The other sweeps event was the catalyst for ushering in the former One Life to Live cast members who had signed on with GH. Cole Thornhart, Starr Manning (Kristen Alderson) and baby Hope Manning-Thornhart are in a car crash involving Anthony Zacchara that kills Cole and Hope. The aftermath brings Starr's mother Blair Cramer (Kassie DePaiva) and father Todd Manning (Roger Howarth) to town, and the latter promptly sets roots by buying the local newspaper and television station. Meanwhile, John McBain (Michael Easton) arrives in town, investigating Sonny Corinthos in the death of his sister. Sonny is put on trial for the car accident, introducing Starr to his son Michael, who become close and start dating months later. Valentini explained the integration of the characters: Meanwhile, Maxie Jones, reeling from guilt over thinking she caused the lab explosion that killed her cousin Robin, falsely confesses to the murder of Lisa Niles and goes to jail. Eventually it comes out that Matt Hunter is the killer, and Maxie is released. Sam gives birth the same day as (another character crossed-over from OLTL) T√©a Delgado (Florencia Lozano), both stranded in the woods. T√©a's baby is stillborn, but is switched with Sam's son by Heather Webber and Todd Manning. T√©a leaves town with the healthy child while Todd finds out from Heather that Jason is the true biological father of the baby. Being blackmailed by Heather, he keeps the secret. After the series was renewed for another year in April, General Hospital cast were invited to the Television Critics Association press conference that summer. A few months under his belt, Valentini said his work was: Valentini also promoted an upcoming umbrella story leading up to the show's September time slot change, that made room for Katie Couric's talk show, Katie. The story involved the reappearance of Robin, who viewers see being held by Ewen Keenan, later revealed to be working for Jerry Jacks. Jerry poisons the town's water supply with the help of Joe Scully, Jr., who is found to be the real killer of McBain's sister. Joe also convinces his son, Trey Mitchell, to marry Sonny's daughter Kristina Davis for revenge. Trey is revealed to be the son of Kate Howard, who had been raped by Joe when they were teenagers, who regresses completely into her alternate personality 'Connie'.

Ratings in the target demographic of women 18 to 34 years old were reported to have risen 44% year over year. MSN Money cited General Hospital as leading a revival of the soap opera genre, stating, \\"Soap fans say the reason for GH's resurgence is simple: The show got a lot better.\\" Michael Logan of TV Guide named General Hospital the best soap of 2012, stating, \\"This time last year, General Hospital was considered dead as disco, a show merely waiting to be officially canceled by ABC. (...) GH was handed to OLTL's head writer, Ron Carlivati, and exec producer Frank Valentini, who quickly amped up the action, humor and romance and energized the cast by adding top stars from GH's past as well as popular refugees from Llanview. Voil√†! Dreary, messy GH was suddenly a thrilling, surprise-packed, can't-miss experience.\\" The series gained more press in early January when it was announced Genie Francis would reprise her role as Laura Spencer for an unknown length of time.

Valentini asserted \\"we're not doing vampires\\" and that the story was homage to the actors and characters involved. Carlivati commented, \\"The story does get pretty over-the-top yet it's still rooted in a certain reality. Lucy may be off-kilter but she's certainly not in Heather Webber territory. Her belief in vampires will be very convincing.\\" Another former Port Charles character, Alison Barrington, arrives with her now teenage son Rafe Kovich, Jr.. McBain is arrested under suspicion of murdering Alison, while Caleb is revealed, seen to be a different person than McBain. A.J. Quartermaine (Sean Kanan) comes back to town after hearing that his brother Jason (Steve Burton) is presumed dead. =2013= The series marked its 50th anniversary on April 1, 2013.

It is also the subject of the 1997 documentary Love Story: Berlin 1942. Schragenheim was deported from Berlin to KZ Theresienstadt (now Czech Republic) on September 8, 1944 by national- socialist Gestapo (transport nr. I/116). On October 9, 1944, she was deported from Theresienstadt to the extermination facility KZ Auschwitz Birkenau to be put to death (transport nr. Ep). As the gas chambers and crematoria were dismantled and blown up between November 1944 and January 1945, the mass extermination in Auschwitz came to an end, gradually. The inmates, including Felice Schragenheim, were taken on a death march to KZ Gro√ü-Rosen, maybe later to a death march to KZ Bergen-Belsen. The date and place of her death are unknown. Officially, the date of her death was defined as December 31, 1944 by a Berlin court in 1948.

Facing increased scrutiny by Nazi officials for her resistance work in 1942, Schragenheim was introduced by an acquaintance, who was employed as a housekeeper in the Berlin household of G√ºnther Wust, a Nazi soldier, to Wust's wife, Charlotte Elisabeth \\"Lilly\\" Wust, who was residing in Berlin- Schmargendorf with her four children while her husband was away at war. Initially introduced by her alias \\"Felice Schr√∂der,\\" she eventually grew close enough to Wust to confide in her. Telling Wust her true name and revealing her history as a Jewish member of the German Resistance, Schragenheim soon fell in love.Wust, Elisabeth. Righteous Among the Nations, Yad Vashem. Their courtship was traditional, according to Kate Connolly, the Berlin correspondent for The Guardian US at the time of her 2001 interview of Lilly Wust. After their introduction, Schragenheim \\"would come to tea at Lilly's almost daily, bringing flowers and poems. In between, the two would write to each other.\\" When Wust was hospitalized with dental sepsis in March 1943, Schragenheim \\"brought red roses every day....

The couple had begun living together at Wust's home in Berlin after Wust legally separated from her husband in 1942; they remained a couple until July 1944 when Schragenheim was reported to Nazi officials and captured by the Gestapo. Arrested at the home she shared with Wust, Schragenheim was taken to the Schulstrasse transit camp in Berlin; held there until September 4, 1944, she was subsequently deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in Czechoslovakia.Wust, Elisabeth. Righteous Among the Nations, Yad Vashem. Despite the danger, Wust made repeated visits to, and exchanged love letters with, Schragenheim at Schulstrasse. Schragenheim also was inspired to write a love poem for Wust.Sarris, Observer. While Schragenheim was imprisoned at Theresienstadt, Wust attempted to arrange a visit, but was refused by the camp's commandant. Before the couple could reunite, Schragenheim was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp. Sent on one or two death marches in December of 1944, according to various historical accounts (one from Auschwitz to the Gross- Rosen concentration camp and the other from Gross-Rosen to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp), Schragenheim is believed to have died on New Year's Eve (December 31, 1944), according to historians at Yad Vashem.Wust, Elisabeth.

Other nearby suburbs are South Hobart and Tolmans Hill. Dynnyrne is Tasmania's second most affluent suburb according to documents released by the Australian Taxation Office. The suburb is named for Dynnyrne House in South Hobart, which was built by Robert William Murray (1777‚Äì1850) who claimed to be descended from Sir William Murray, 1st baronet of Dunearn in Scotland.Murray, C.

Retrieved 10 September 2012. Members of the public had been invited to suggest names for the suburb in 1940. About eighty different suggestions were received and six of them were forwarded to the Post Office for consideration. Cooloola, Illawarra, Karinga, Telopea, Rosslyn and Pambula were all rejected on the basis that they exactly or closely duplicated names already used in Australia. Following further consultation with the Post Office, Dynnyrne was chosen, recalling the first house built in the area about one hundred years earlier. One of the Hobart City Council aldermen warned that people would have difficulty knowing how to spell Dynnyrne but the new name was adopted.Howatson, Donald, The Story of Sandy Bay - Street by Street, 2016, References Category:Localities of City of Hobart ","title":"Dynnyrne, Tasmania"},{"id":"8028725","text":"John Palmer (28 January 1785, Bishop Middleham, County Durham - 23 August 1846, Chorlton-on-Medlock, Manchester) was an English architect who practised in Manchester.

Cores to accommodate holes can be seen in the bottom half of the mould, which is called the drag. The top half of the mould is called the cope. In casting, a pattern is a replica of the object to be cast, used to prepare the cavity into which molten material will be poured during the casting process. Patterns used in sand casting may be made of wood, metal, plastics or other materials. Patterns are made to exacting standards of construction, so that they can last for a reasonable length of time, according to the quality grade of the pattern being built, and so that they will repeatably provide a dimensionally acceptable casting.http://mechanicalinventions.blogspot.com/2012/12/types-of- patterns.html Patternmaking The making of patterns, called patternmaking (sometimes styled pattern-making or pattern making), is a skilled trade that is related to the trades of tool and die making and moldmaking, but also often incorporates elements of fine woodworking. Patternmakers (sometimes styled pattern-makers or pattern makers) learn their skills through apprenticeships and trade schools over many years of experience. Although an engineer may help to design the pattern, it is usually a patternmaker who executes the designShelly, Joseph Atkinson. Patternmaking: A treatise on the construction and application of patterns, including the use of woodworking tools, the art of joinery, wood turning, and various methods of building patterns and core- boxes of different types.The common types of patterns are: 1) Single piece pattern 2) Split piece pattern 3) Loose piece pattern 4) Gated pattern 5) Match pattern 6) Sweep pattern 7) Cope and drag pattern 8) Skeleton pattern 9) Shell pattern 10) Follow board pattern 11) segmental pattern New York: Industrial Press, 1920; pp. 2-5 et seq Materials used Typically, materials used for pattern making are wood, metal or plastics. Wax and Plaster of Paris are also used, but only for specialized applications. Sugar pine is the most commonly used material for patterns, primarily because it is soft, light, and easy to work. Honduras Mahogany was used for more production parts because it is harder and would last longer than pine. Once properly cured it is about as stable as any wood available, not subject to warping or curling. Once the pattern is built the foundry does not want it changing shape. True Honduras Mahogany is harder to find now because of the decimation of the rain forests, so now there are a variety of woods marketed as Mahogany. Fiberglass and plastic patterns have gained popularity in recent years because they are water proof and very durable. Metal patterns are long lasting and do not succumb to moisture, but they are heavier, more expensive and difficult to repair once damaged. Wax patterns are used in a casting process called investment casting. A combination of paraffin wax, bees wax and carnauba wax is used for this purpose. Plaster of paris is usually used in making master dies and molds, as it gains hardness quickly, with a lot of flexibility when in the setting stage. Design =Sprues, gates, risers, cores, and chills or no= The patternmaker or foundry engineer decides where the sprues, gating systems, and risers are placed with respect to the pattern. Where a hole is desired in a casting, a core may be used which defines a volume or location in a casting where metal will not flow into. Sometimes chills may be placed on a pattern surface prior to molding, which are then formed into the sand mould. Chills are heat sinks which enable localized rapid cooling. The rapid cooling may be desired to refine the grain structure or determine the freezing sequence of the molten metal which is poured into the mould. Because they are at a much cooler temperature, and often a different metal than what is being poured, they do not attach to the casting when the casting cools. The chills can then be reclaimed and reused. The design of the feeding and gating system is usually referred to as methoding or methods design. It can be carried out manually, or interactively using general-purpose CAD software, or semi- automatically using special-purpose software (such as AutoCAST) Types of Patterns Patterns are made of wood, metal, ceramic, or hard plastics and vary in complexity. A single piece pattern, or loose pattern, is the simplest. It is a replica of the desired casting‚Äîusually in a slightly larger size to offset the contraction of the intended metal. Gated patterns connect a number of loose patterns together with a series of runners that will be detached after shake-out. Segmented or multi-piece patterns create a casting in several pieces to be joined in post-processing. Match plate patterns are patterns with the top and bottom parts of the pattern, also known as the cope and drag portions, mounted on opposite sides of a board. This adaptation allows patterns to be quickly moulded out of the molding material. A similar technique called a cope and drag pattern is often used for large castings or large production runs: in this variation, the two sides of the pattern are mounted on separate pattern plates that can be hooked up to horizontal or vertical machines and moulded with the molding material. When the parting lines between the cope and drag are irregular, a follow board can be used to support irregularly shaped, loose patterns. Sweep patterns are used for symmetric molds, which are contoured shapes rotated around a center axis or pole through the molding material. A sweep pattern is a form of skeleton pattern: any geometrical pattern that creates a mold by being moved through the molding material. Allowances To compensate for any dimensional changes which will happen during the (solid) cooling process, allowances are usually made in the pattern. =Liquid Shrinkage= Almost all metals shrink volumetrically during solidification, this is known as liquid shrinkage. Another way of saying that is almost all metals undergo a volume increase upon melting, or liquidus temperature. Typical \\"volume shrinkage\\" is in the range between 3.5% to 10.0 % depending on the alloy. Some graphitic cast irons, when cast in heavier sections, under well controlled conditions, can exhibit a slight positive yield. Type Metal is also known, and used, for its ability to hold a true and sharp cast, and retain correct dimensions after cooling. Normally when making engineering cast parts the \\"method\\" is designed along with the pattern - being the riser size, number of risers, and location of risers. Additionally downsprue(s), runner bar(s), and ingate(s) are also designed in \\"the method\\". The \\"method\\" thus ensures the molten metal is delivered, the mould filled correctly, and the risers filled to \\"feed\\" the \\"shrinking volume\\" of liquid to the casting during solidification. This \\"method\\" is done by a \\"methods engineer\\", whom may be a patternmaker (with additional training), a founding engineer, or metallurgist whom is familiar with concept of volume increase / volume loss associated with melting and casting / solidification. Example: Assume steel at 7.85 density (solid) and 6% shrinkage, or better said, a 6% volume increase when molten. A mould has been made to cast a 100 kg block, based on the solid density of steel. The liquid density of steel is only 94% that of its solid density value - about 7.38 when liquid. Thus when the 100 kg block (solid calculation) is filled with liquid it contains a mass of only 94 kg. The 6kg, has to be supplied from a \\"riser\\" or \\"feeder\\" during solidification - thus the solid object now has a mass of 100 kg. The method is a system to deal with the volume loss during solidification. This (technically) is not an allowance. =Contraction allowance= After solidification has completed the dimensional size will then undergo linear contraction. This linear contraction proceeds right through cooling to room temperature. To compensate this, the pattern is made larger than the required casting. This extra size that is given on the pattern for metal contraction is called \\"the contraction allowance\\". These values are typically between 0.6 % and 2.5 %. This is accounted for using a contraction rule, which is an oversized rule. Contraction rules are generally available for the common industrially cast alloys. Alternately, the Patternmaker will simply add a nominated percentage to all dimensions. An example of this allowance - if a bush were required to be 1500mm O/D, 1000mm I/D and 300mm high using a 2% contraction rule: The Patternmaker would make the pattern 1530mm O/D, (as it will contract in), 980 I/D (as the inside diameter will contract outwards) - important to note the Inside Diameter has 20mm \\"taken off it\\" rather than \\"added to it\\" - which is the correct contraction allowance. Finally, the height dimension would be 306mm. The contraction amount can also be varied slightly by the sand system being used for the mould and any cores, for example clay-bonded sand, chemical bonded sands, or other bonding materials used within the sand. Exact values can vary between different foundries due to the sand systems being used. Each foundry, by gauging its own patterns and castings, can refine their own contraction allowances. Shrinkage and Contraction can again be classified into liquid shrinkage and solid contraction. Liquid shrinkage is the reduction in volume during the process of solidification (liquid to solid), the liquid shrinkage is accounted for by risers. Solid contraction is the reduction in dimensions during the cooling of the (solid) cast metal. Contraction allowance takes into account only the solid contraction. =Draft allowance= When the pattern is to be removed from the sand mold, there is a possibility that any leading edges may break off, or get damaged in the process. To avoid this, a taper is provided on the pattern, so as to facilitate easy removal of the pattern from the mold, and hence reduce damage to edges. The taper angle provided is called the Draft angle. The value of the draft angle depends upon the complexity of the pattern, the type of molding (hand molding or machine molding), height of the surface, etc. Draft provided on the casting is usually 1 to 3 degrees on external surfaces (5 to 8 internal surfaces). =Finishing or Machining allowance= The surface finish obtained in sand castings is generally poor (dimensionally inaccurate), and hence in many cases, the cast product is subjected to machining processes like turning or grinding in order to improve the surface finish. During machining processes, some metal is removed from the piece. To compensate for this, a machining allowance (additional material) should be given in the casting. the amount of finish allowance depends on the material of the casting,size of casting,volume of production, method of molding, etc. =Shake allowance= Usually during removal of the pattern from the mold cavity, the pattern is rapped all around the faces, in order to facilitate easy removal. In this process, the final cavity is enlarged. To compensate for this, the pattern dimensions need to be reduced. There are no standard values for this allowance, as it is heavily dependent on the personnel. This allowance is a negative allowance, and a common way of going around this allowance is to increase the draft allowance. Shaking of the pattern causes an enlargement of the mould cavity and results in a bigger casting. =Distortion allowance= During cooling of the mould, stresses developed in the solid metal may induce distortions in the cast. This is more evident when the mould is thinner in width as compared to its length. This can be eliminated by initially distorting the pattern in the opposite direction. Demand Patterns continue to be needed for sand casting of metals. For the production of gray iron, ductile iron and steel castings, sand casting remains the most widely used process. For aluminum castings, sand casting represents about 12% of the total tonnage by weight (surpassed only by die casting at 57%, and semi-permanent and permanent mold at 19%; based on 2006 shipments). The exact process and pattern equipment is always determined by the order quantities and the casting design. Sand casting can produce as little as one part, or as many as a million copies.

Woodland Hills School District was formed in July 1981 by a mandated merger of Edgewood, General Braddock, Swissvale, Churchill and Turtle Creek school districts. The Woodland Hills School District is unique in that it was formed by a court order (one of only three such districts so formed in Pennsylvania) in 1982 as a result of a Civil Rights Act lawsuit filed by various residents of the prior school districts. It was formed from an amalgamation of seven separate districts in the eastern region of Allegheny County in suburban Pittsburgh. The suit was filed to address the fact that the seven districts were all composed almost exclusively of all white or all black student enrollments. This resulted in African American students being transported long distances past all White schools and vice versa. The resultant court order created a single large school district of over 7,000 students comprised almost equally of white and black students.Woodland Hills School District Administration, School Improvement Grant Plan, 2012 Woodland Hills School District is bordered by eight other school districts: Pittsburgh S.D., Penn Hills S.D., Gateway S.D., East Allegheny S.D., Wilkinsburg Borough S.D.

Special education In December 2010, the district administration reported that 854 pupils or 20.4% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 29% identified students having a specific learning disability. In 2009, the administration reported that 901 or 20.4% received Special Education services. In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress . To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the district's Special Education Department. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. The Woodland Hills School District received a $3,351,401 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì12 and 2012‚Äì13 school year, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010‚Äì11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Investing in PA kids, April 2012 =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 396 or 7.45% of its students were gifted in 2009. The highest percentage of gifted students reported among all 500 school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pennsylvania was North Allegheny School District with 15.5% of its students identified as gifted. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Budget In 2011, the average teacher salary in Woodland Hills School District was $54,781.47 a year, while the cost of the benefits teachers receive was $22,984.57 per employee, for a total annual average teacher compensation of $77,766.04. According to a study conducted at the American Enterprise Institute, in 2011, public school teachers‚Äô total compensation is roughly 50 percent higher than they would likely receive in the private sector. The study found that the most generous benefits that teachers receive are not accounted for in many studies of compensation, including: pension, retiree health benefits and job security. In 2009, Woodland Hills School District reported employing 499 teachers and administrators with a median salary of $56,961 and a top salary of $141,750. The teacher's work day is 7 hours and 30 minutes, with 192 days in the contract year. Teachers receive a daily preparation period with additionally pay for hours worked outside of regular day.

The findings were reported to the School Board and the District's administration. The district is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax - 1%, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Interest earnings on accounts also provide nontax income to the district. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension income and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax, regardless of the level of the individual's personal wealth. =State basic education funding= For the 2012‚Äì13 school year, the district will receive $14,105,004. The Governor's Executive Budget for 2012-2013 includes $9.34 billion for kindergarten through 12th grade public education, including $5.4 billion in basic education funding, which is an increase of $49 million over the 2011-12 budget. The state also provides $100 million for the Accountability Block grant. The state will also provide $544.4 million for School Employees‚Äô Social Security and $856 million for School Employees‚Äô Retirement fund called PSERS. This amount is a $21,823,000 increase (0.34%) over the 2011-2012 appropriations for Basic Education Funding, School Employees' Social Security, Pupil Transportation, Nonpublic and Charter School Pupil Transportation. Since taking office, Corbett's first two budgets have restored more than $918 million in support of public schools, compensating for the $1 billion in federal stimulus dollars lost at the end of the 2010‚Äì11 school year. In 2011‚Äì12, the district received a $13,778,182 allocation, of state Basic Education Funding. Additionally, the Woodland Hills School District received $327,875 in Accountability Block Grant funding.

One hundred fifty Pennsylvania school districts received the base 2% increase. The highest increase in 2010-11 went to Kennett Consolidated School District in Chester County which received a 23.65% increase in state funding. The state's hold harmless policy regarding state basic education funding continued where each district received at least the same amount as it received the prior school year, even where enrollment had significantly declined. The amount of increase each school district received was set by Governor Edward Rendell and then Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state budget proposal given each February. This was the second year of Governor Rendell's policy to fund some districts at a far greater rate than others. In the 2009‚Äì2010 budget year the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania provided a 5.11% increase in Basic Education funding for a total of $14,482,470. Four county school districts received increases of over 6% in Basic Education Funding in 2008‚Äì10. Chartiers Valley School District received an 8.17% increase.

Accountability block grants Beginning in 2004‚Äì2005, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students.

The funding was limited to the 2009‚Äì10 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. Race to the Top grant School district officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant which would have brought the district millions of additional federal dollars for improving student academic achievement.Pennsylvania's 'Race to the Top' Fueled by Effective Reforms, Strong Local Support, January 20, 2010.

The Member of Parliament of Caernarfon as well as other members of the House were extremely concerned about the huge expense that the House was being made to pay for the war.

Hodgson, as representative of a powerful nation himself, was accorded traditional honors upon entering the city with children singing \\"God Save the Queen\\" to Lady Hodgson. After ascending a platform, he made a speech to the assembled Ashanti leaders. The speech, or the closest surviving account that comes through an Ashanti translator, reportedly read: An Akan stool believed to be for a Queen mother, 1940‚Äì1965, in the collection of the Children's Museum of Indianapolis Not understanding the sacred and holy significance of the Golden Stool, Hodgson clearly had no inkling of the storm his words would produce. The suggestion that he, a foreigner, should sit upon and defile the Holy Golden Stool, which was the very embodiment of the Soul of the Ashanti Nation, and the holy symbol of unity of the Ashanti peoples - living, dead, and yet to be born - was far too insufferable for the crowd. On July 7, 1900, The Star Newspaper on the British Isle of Guernsey, featured an article about the War of The Golden Stool and the Great Warrior Queen Yaa Asantewaa I, who became the Supreme Military Commander of this Holy War, that the tiny Akan-Asante People of Coomassie waged against the Goliath British Empire and its Queen Empress of India: The Colonial Office has received disquieting news that the Great Warrior Queen Yaa Asantewaa I (misspelled Ashantuah) ruler of Ejisu, has taken Supreme Military Command of the insurgent forces. She has under her Command, General Asmarah, and an army of 20,000 Warriors, including a battalion of Amazons and 1000 hand picked Soldiers who form a kind of Sacred Band. In Her Famous Classic War Speech, The Great Warrior Queen Yaa Asantewaa I, who was also the Queen Mother of the Ejisu dominion within the Ashanti kingdom, rallied resistance against the colonialists: \\"Now I have seen that some of you fear to go forward to fight for our king. If it were in the brave days, the days of Osei Tutu, Okomfo Anokye, and Opoku Ware, chiefs would not sit down to see their king taken away without firing a shot. No white man [Obroni] could have dared to speak to a chief of the Ashanti in the way the Governor spoke to you chiefs this morning. Is it true that the bravery of the Ashanti is no more? I cannot believe it. It cannot be! I must say this, if you, the men of Ashanti, will not go forward, then we will. We, the women, will. I shall call upon my fellow women. We will fight the white men. We will fight till the last of us falls in the battlefields.\\" She collected men to form a force with which to attack the British and retrieve the exiled king. The enraged populace produced a large number of volunteers. As Hodgson's deputy, Captain Cecil Armitage, searched for the stool in a nearby brush, his force was surrounded and ambushed, only a sudden rainstorm allowing the survivors to retreat to the British offices in Kumasi. The offices were then fortified into a small stockade, square with loopholed high stone walls and firing turrets at each corner, that housed 18 Europeans, dozens of mixed-race colonial administrators, and 500 Nigerian Hausas with six small field guns and four Maxim guns. The British detained several high ranking leaders in the fort. The Ashanti, aware that they were unprepared for storming the fort settled into a long siege, only making one assault on the position on 29 April that was unsuccessful. The Ashanti then continued to snipe at the defenders, cut the telegraph wires, blockade food supplies, and attack relief columns. Blocking all roads leading to the town with 21 log barricades six feet high with loopholes to fire through, hundreds of yards long and so solid they would be impervious to artillery fire. As supplies ran low and disease took its toll on the defenders, another rescue party of 700 arrived in June. Recognising that it was necessary to escape from the trap and to preserve the remaining food for the wounded and sick, some of the healthier men along with Hodgson, his wife and over a hundred of the Hausas made a break on 23 June, meeting up with the rescue force they were evacuated. 12,000 Ashanti abrade (warriors) were summoned to attack the escapees, who gained a lead on the long road back to the Crown Colony, thus avoiding the main body of the Abrade. Days later the few survivors of the abrade assault took a ship for Accra, receiving all available medical attention. The rescue column As Hodgson arrived at the coast, a rescue force of 1,000 men assembled from various British units and police forces stationed across West Africa and under the command of Major James Willcocks had set out from Accra. On the march Willcocks's men had been repulsed from several well-defended forts belonging to groups allied with the Ashanti ‚Äî most notably the stockade at Kokofu, where they had suffered heavy casualties. During the march Willcocks was faced with constant trials of skirmishing with an enemy in his own element while maintaining his supply route in the face of an opposing force utilizing unconventional warfare. In early July, his force arrived at Beckwai and prepared for the final assault on Kumasi, which began on the morning of 14 July 1900. Using a force led by Yoruba warriors from Nigeria serving in the Frontier Force, Willcocks drove in four heavily guarded stockades, finally relieving the fort on the evening of the fifteenth, when the inhabitants were just two days from surrender. In September, after spending the summer recuperating and tending to the sick and wounded in captured Kumasi, Willcocks sent out flying columns to the neighbouring regions that had supported the uprising. His troops defeated an Ashanti force in a skirmish at Obassa on the 30 September and also succeeded in destroying the fort and town at Kokofu where he had been previously repulsed, using Nigerian levies to hunt Ashanti soldiers. Ashanti defenders would usually exit the engagement quickly after a stiff initial assault. Following the storming of the town, Captain Charles John Melliss was awarded the Victoria Cross for his bravery in the attack. Aftermath Ashanti was annexed into the British Empire; however, the Ashanti still largely governed themselves. They gave little or no deference to colonial authorities. The Ashanti were successful in their pre-war goal to protect the Golden Stool. But, the following year, the British arrested numerous chiefs, including the Queen Mother of Ejisu, Yaa Asantewaa, and exiled them to the Seychelles for 25 years. In that 25-year period many of them died, including Yaa Asantewaa herself in 1921. Kumasi City retains a memorial to this war and several large colonial residences. Ashanti and the former Gold Coast eventually became part of Ghana. The war cost the British and their allies approximately 1,000 fatalities in total; however, according to a statement made by MP David Lloyd George in Parliament in 1901, \\"the Colonial Office should have had some justification for the foolish policy of the [British] Government in regard to the Golden Stool, that had led to the hundreds and thousands of the corpses of savages festering round the fort of Coomassie\\"! David Lloyd George further admonished Joseph Chamberlain, for his inhumane attitude towards the Human Life of the Asante People who were needlessly killed during the War, because the Golden Stool was never captured by the British: \\"Surely human life was worth some respectful treatment\\", he said. . The Golden Stool was hidden deep in the forests for the duration of the war. The British continued to seek it until 1921. Shortly after this, it was accidentally uncovered by a team of labourers. They took the golden ornaments that adorned the stool, and left the rest which was of wood. An Ashanti court sentenced the labourers to death for their desecration, but British officials intervened, and arranged for their exile instead. Return of the King Prempeh I to Ashanti In 1924, the King was allowed to return. \\"Thousands of people, white and black, flocked down to the beach to welcome him. They were sorely disappointed when the news flashed through that Nana Prempeh was not to be seen by anyone, and that he was to land at 5:30 pm and proceed straight away to Kumasi by a special train. Twenty minutes after the arrival of the train, a beautiful car brought Nana Prempeh into the midst of the assembly. It was difficult for us to realise even yet that he had arrived. A charming aristocratic-looking person in a black long suit with a fashionable black hat held up his hand to the cheers of the crowd. That noble figure was Nana Prempeh.\\" See also *Ashantiland *Ashanti people *History of Ghana References ;Footnotes (The quoted text apparently does not appear in the 1972 first edition from Ghana Publishing House.)

The offence is not fully equivalent to the offence of arson in England and Wales. The difference is that wilful fire-raising only covers fires that were started deliberately. The English-Welsh offence of arson can include cases where the fire was not entirely deliberate but made possible through malicious or reckless behaviour. In Scots law, if a fire is the result of an act of recklessness then the offence of culpable and reckless conduct applies. It is common to find both offences charged together where criminal events involve fire and both offences carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. In practice, wilful fire-raising is often treated as being equivalent to arson for some purposes such as statistics. Prior to the case of Byrne v H.M. Advocate (No. 2)2000 JC 155; 2000 SCCR 77; 2000 SLT 233 there was a distinction between \\"wilful fire-raising\\" and \\"culpable and reckless fire- raising\\".A Draft Criminal Code for Scotland with Commentary, pub.

Frank Baum. Founding When the Chicago publishing firm of George M. Hill, the publisher of the first edition of Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900), went out of business in March 1902, two of its employees, head salesman Sumner Charles Britton and production manager Frank Kennicott Reilly,Rogers, p. 121. formed their own publishing venture, the Madison Book Company of Chicago. (Britton was an Arkansas native who first came to Chicago in 1893, to report on the World's Columbian Exposition for The Kansas City Star. He was strongly enough impressed with the city to relocate there in July 1894.)Meyer, \\"Notes from the Royal Historian.\\" In 1904, Reilly and Britton decided to incorporate as a new publishing house under their own names. Needing a name author, the new partners solicited Baum, who was unhappy with his arrangement with Bobbs- Merrill, publisher of several of his previous works.This company, originally Bowen-Merrill, had bought the rights to Baum's Father Goose: His Book, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, and Dot and Tot of Merryland from the bankrupt George M. Hill Co., and published The Master Key (1901), The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus (1902), and The Enchanted Island of Yew (1903). Signing Baum to an exclusive contract (dated 16 January 1904), the partners and their author agreed that the best way to start their joint effort was with a sequel to Baum's greatest success to date. The second of the Oz books, The Marvelous Land of Oz, was in print later in 1904, in time for the Christmas season. Success with Baum With a strong initial focus on children's books, the firm published editions of the fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen and The Brothers Grimm in 1905; but their mainstay in their early years remained L. Frank Baum. Reilly & Britton issued eleven titles by Baum in 1906: the fantasy novel John Dough and the Cherub, under Baum's name; Daughters of Destiny, an adult romance by \\"Schuyler Staunton;\\" the juvenile novel Annabel, by \\"Suzanne Metcalf;\\" a book for boys, Sam Steele's Adventures on Land and Sea, by \\"Capt. Hugh Fitzgerald,\\" and one for girls, Aunt Jane's Nieces, by \\"Edith Van Dyne\\" -- the last one was so successful that it inspired a ten-volume series of the same name. There was also a set of six booklets for small children, collectively known as The Twinkle Tales, by \\"Laura Bancroft,\\" with illustrations by Maginel Wright Enright.The six titles were: Mr. Woodchuck, Bandit Jim Crow, Prairie-Dog Town, Prince Mud-Turtle, Twinkle's Enchantment, and Sugar-Loaf Mountain. The six were a popular success, selling a total of 40,000 copies, and were later re-printed in one volume, as Twinkle and Chubbins: Their Astonishing Adventures in Nature-Fairyland (1911). The firm paid Baum a 10% royalty on each of the first five books, and two-and-a-half cents per copy on the booklets. (Mindful of his past financial difficulties, Baum also negotiated monthly royalty payments, instead of the more usual yearly payment.) If the six booklets are counted as a single full-length volume, the firm issued six books by Baum in 1906 alone. Baum continued this high level of productivity for a time, with another six titles published in 1907, five by Reilly & Britton. The five were: Ozma of Oz and Father Goose's Year Book, under his own name; Aunt Jane's Nieces Abroad, by \\"Edith Van Dyne;\\" Sam Steele's Adventures in Panama, by \\"Capt. Fitzgerald\\" again; and \\"Laura Bancroft's\\" Policeman Bluejay.Baum also did a private publication of his Tamawaca Folks that year, to make the total of six. Aunt Jane's Nieces Abroad was printed with the mistaken date of \\"1906,\\" causing confusion in Baum's bibliography. The 1906-7 Sam Steele titles were not especially successful, though they did better in later years, when they were repackaged as installments of Baum's Boy Fortune Hunters series, by \\"Floyd Akers.\\" Baum's productivity slackened somewhat after the 1906-7 peak, with four books in 1908, and three each in 1909 and 1910, but five in 1911 and four in 1912; and then two or three books a year for the remainder of his life. Baum had already been friendly with Britton and Reilly before he signed with them; their friendships continued and developed over the ensuing years. Baum was closer with Britton than Reilly, addressing his letters to the former to \\"Brit,\\" and to the latter to \\"Mr. Reilly\\" -- though both men and their families visited \\"The Sign of the Goose,\\" the Baums' summer home in Macatawa Park, Michigan. Since Baum was their star writer, the firm promoted his works prominently and imaginatively, with contests, paper cut-outs of Oz characters, press releases in Oz-newspaper format, and similar tactics. When Baum became enmeshed in financial difficulties in 1911, Reilly & Britton put him on salary (though the move wasn't enough to forestall Baum's bankruptcy in June of that year). Even with their heavy concentration on children's books, the partners also published general purpose works of fact and fiction, including the poetry of Edgar Guest and some of the works of Harold Bell Wright; they also published sports-related material, especially baseball books. They even tried the periodical side of publishing, with a venture called The Book Crier, subtitled \\"A Magazine of Optimism.\\" (As is sometimes true of optimism itself, the \\"Magazine of Optimism\\" did not endure.) Later period The company went through a re-organization in 1919, when Britton's share was sold to long-time employee William F. Lee; the partnership was renamed Reilly & Lee.The 1918 first printing of Baum's The Tin Woodman of Oz bears the Reilly & Britton imprint; all subsequent printings bear that of Reilly & Lee. Gardner, p. 171. The company continued the Oz book series after Baum's 1919 death, with titles by successive \\"Royal Historians of Oz\\" Ruth Plumly Thompson, John R. Neill, Jack Snow, Rachel R. Cosgrove, and Eloise Jarvis McGraw. The firm pursued some imaginative promotional activities for its Oz books through the 1920s, with comic strips, a fan club and plays for children, and other tactics -- though these largely ceased with the 1932 death of Frank K. Reilly.Greene and Martin, pp. 68-73. Frank J. O'Donnell served as president of the company in the 1940s and the early 1950s. While the firm never grew to be one of the major publishing houses of its era, it remained in business through six decades. In 1959 the company was purchased by the Henry Regnery Co., which for a time maintained Reilly & Lee as a separate imprint for Oz books and related titles. (In turn, Henry Regnery later assigned the Oz series to Contemporary Books, also of Chicago, which eventually was absorbed as a division of McGraw-Hill.)

It is native to tropical rainforests and gallery forests in northern and north-eastern Queensland coasts and the Northern Territory of Australia, as well as New Guinea and Java. Common names include Australia umbrella tree, Queensland umbrella tree, octopus tree and amate.  Description  Schefflera actinophylla is an evergreen tree growing to 15 m (49 ft) tall. It has palmately compound medium green leaves in groups of seven leaflets. It is usually multi-trunked, and the flowers develop at the top of the tree. It often grows as a hemiepiphyte on other rainforest trees.Martin (2005), p. 43. It produces racemes up to 2 m (6.5 ft) long containing up to 1,000 small red flowers. Flowering begins in early summer and typically continues for several months. The specific epithet actinophylla means \\"with radiating leaves\\".  Ecology  The up to 1,000 flowers produced by the plant generate large amounts of nectar, attracting nectar-eating birds that pollinate them. The fruits are eaten by many birds and animals including musky rat-kangaroos, red- legged pademelons and spectacled flying foxes.Beasley (2006). Its leaves are a favourite food of the Bennett's tree-kangaroo.Pers. comm. Lewis Roberts OAMMartin (2005).Beasley (2009), p. 105.  Cultivation  Schefflera actinophylla is commonly grown in mild to warm climates as a decorative tree in larger gardens and, when mature, it has red spikes of flowers with up to 20 racemes which develop in summer or early autumn. Propagation is by seed or cuttings. It prefers well-drained soil and only needs occasional watering and feeding to thrive. It is, however, an aggressive plant and its roots can dominate surrounding soil. In some areas (e.g., Florida and Hawaii, USA), it is an invasive weed and therefore planting is highly unadvised.Hawaii's Most Invasive Horticultural Plants : octopus tree Schefflera actinophylla With a minimum temperature of , juvenile specimens are grown in temperate regions as houseplants.

It is one of six city theatres collectively known as Melbourne's East End Theatre District. Designed by Charles Ballantyne in an ornately palatial style, with a Gothic style lobby, Louis XVI style auditorium, and the Spanish Baroque style Plaza Ballroom in the basement, it is listed by the National Trust of Australia and is on the Victorian Heritage Register. Opening and early years The Regent Theatre site on Collins Street was purchased by Hoyts Theatres director Francis W. Thring to be the flagship for his Regent theatre circuit. It was designed by Cedric Ballantyne, who had designed earlier theatres for Thring, and toured movie palaces in the US, drawing inspiration from their eclectic sources such as Spanish Gothic and French Renaissance styles to produce \\"one of Victoria's largest and most lavish cinemas in the inter-war period.\\" The opening of the Regent Theatre on the 15 March 1929 was a big event, with the Lord Mayor Cr Luxton in attendance, who declared \\"this theatre is an architectural asset to the city of which we can all be proud (loud applause)\\". The theatre had 3,250 seats, came equipped with a Wurlitzer organ as well as an orchestra pit and resident orchestra (to accompany the silent films), and opening night program included a number of live acts, and The Two Lovers, starring Roland Coleman and Vilma Banky was the feature presentation. Uniquely, there was a second theatre below the main one, called The Plaza; originally this was to be a cabaret but licensing issues led to the change of use. It was wired for sound, and opened on 10 May 1929 with Alias Jimmy Valentine. In late 1930, F W Thring sold his interest in Hoyts to Fox Film. The cinema was subject to a disastrous fire on 29 April 1945 which destroyed the auditorium, organ, fly tower and roof, but leaving the foyers and The Plaza largely intact. With a dispensation from post-war building restrictions, the Regent was rebuilt much as it was, under the direction of architects Cowper Murphy & Appleford, making it one of the last picture palaces to be built in this style. Reopening on 19 December 1947, a few changes were made, such as the proscenium being made square instead of arched, and the central bronze chandelier became an imported Czechoslovakian crystal design. The Regent screen was enlarged to play Cinemascope in 1953, opening with the epic The Robe, and in 1958 the Plaza was extensively altered to fit a Cinerama screen, and the 1962 epic How the West Was Won ran for two years. By the 1960s, it became clear that the huge Picture Palaces had had their day, and Hoyts investigated splitting the Regent into two cinemas, but instead the multi-screen Hoyts Cinema Centre opened in Bourke Street in 1969. Closure and demolition threat On 1 July 1970, Hoyts shut the doors of the Regent for the last time. The South Yarra Regent closed the same night and the Ballarat Regent closed the same year. The Plaza closed in November of that year, and in December 1970, an auction was held at the theatre where everything that was not bolted down was auctioned off, raising a few thousand dollars. In response to the closure and clouds over the building's future, a \\"Save the Regent\\" committee was soon formed by former theatre staff, theatre enthusiasts and others including Loris Webster, who ran a nearby cafe) to campaign for its preservation. The Regent was located next to the site that the Melbourne City Council finally chose in 1966 for the much talked about City Square project, and Council soon moved to purchase the closed theatre to enable a larger scale redevelopment, at first including a high-rise hotel. The Council's decision to purchase the Regent was one of the factors that, ironically, ensured the theatres‚Äô survival, since they were subject to public pressure where a private owner would not have been. In 1974 the National Trust declined to list the theatre, claiming it was not of sufficient significance. The same year Lord Mayor Alan Douglas Whalley demanded that the Regent be demolished, presenting a report headed by Sir Roy Grounds to quell the conservationists and claiming that the Regent was not worthy of preservation in declaring that it was \\"not the Colosseum\\". The council argued that the long blank side wall of the Regent would compromise architects abilities to create grand visions for the site. Save The Regent maintained their pressure, and responded with a petition of 2000 signatures to the City Council. Later that year, the next Lord Mayor Ron Walker supported his predecessor, however Builders Labourers Federation secretary Norm Gallagher announced a green ban on the building preventing demolition. In 1975, Victorian premier Rupert Hamer established a Public Inquiry which heard evidence from all parties, and concluded the Regent should be saved as a theater and concert venue associated with the City Square, to the displeasure of the City Council. He then offered up to $2 million in interest free loans to restore and maintain it, but nothing eventuated. In 1979 the National Trust reversed its stance and classified the theatre (and later successfully nominated it to the Victorian Heritage Register in 1988, and then upgraded its classification to National level after the restoration). In 1980 with the Regent still empty, the City Square finally opened, incorporating the space of the Plaza Theatre, with the interior was gutted leaving only the ceiling intact. Though the 1980s, proposals came and went, often involving putting the building out to tender, without any offer of funding, including as an art centre, a ballet centre, and as a Casino and poker machine venue. Following the controversial demolition of the Regent in Sydney in 1988, by the 1990s, the significance and fate of Australia's remaining 'picture palaces' was becoming an important issue. Most regional grand movie theatres had been lost, as well as all the major cinemas in Brisbane (only the lobby of the Regent Theatre remained), Adelaide and Perth, but many of the major Picture Palaces remained in Sydney and Melbourne, though most in a poor state. Much of the decoration of the Capitol Theatre in Sydney had been removed, the State Theatre remained intact but little used, Melbourne's Capitol Theatre had lost its stalls and faced an uncertain future, and the Forum Theatre had become a mega-church. In 1992, the city council voted on a proposal to demolish the Regent and approve the redevelopment of the site as part of a commercial precinct consisting of multi-storey retail buildings, however council voted down the proposal.'Back 30 years' Herald Sun 14 January 1992 The Regent eventually lay unused for 26 years. Restoration and Reopening Entrepreneur David Marriner, who had earlier restored the historic Princess Theatre (Melbourne), bringing the new breed of musical theatre the Melbourne, proposed a complicated deal to the Melbourne City Council and the new State Government led by Jeff Kennett which involved the restoration of the theatre for musicals in return for developing a large hotel on part of the City Square, itself proposed for redevelopment. The State Government would purchase a half share of the theatre, with the money going to the refurbishment, while Marriner's purchase price for half the square from the Council would also go to the refurbishment, which ultimately cost $25 million. The redevelopment, which was undertaken by commercial builder Hansen Yuncken, took 3 years from September 1993, and involved complete overhaul, repairs, new services, installation of extensive stage facilities, recreation of decorative fixtures and finishes including much of the furniture and the ornate street front ticket booth (since removed again), and creation of a new stalls lobby in matching style. Using photos supplied by a member of the Save The Regent Theatre Committee, Ian Williams, the Plaza Theatre was also fully and magnificently restored to its original ballroom format. The work was overseen by heritage architects Lovell Chen. The Regent Theatre reopened with a gala event on 17 August 1996, and on 26 October Andrew Lloyd Webber's Sunset Boulevard premiered. 2019 Refurbishment In April 2019, Marriner Group in partnership with the building's owners, the Victorian State Government and the Melbourne City Council, commenced a major refurbishment of the Regent Theatre auditorium. Alongside cosmetic upgrades including replica heritage pattern carpets and paintwork repair, the major construction component was an extension to the Dress Circle balcony, bringing it four meters closer to the stage in order to improve the relationship between audience and stage. Additional work was undertaken to improve the theatre design including a new seating layout and refined floor rake to improve sight lines to the stage. The project took eight months to complete and cost an estimate $19.4 million. Building was undertaken by ICON Construction, overseen by Lovell Chen. The Regent Theatre reopened on 11 January 2020 with the National Theatre's production of War Horse, the first play at the theatre in its then 90 year history. Shows The theatre is mostly used for large-scale musicals.

Noori makes Jam happy with her perfect surrender and obedience which causes him to raise her above all the other queens. The story also appears in Shah Jo Risalo and forms part of seven popular tragic romances from Sindh, Pakistan. The other six tales are Umar Marvi, Sassui Punnhun, Sohni Mehar, Lilan Chanesar, Sorath Rai Diyach and Momal Rano commonly known as the Seven Queens of Sindh, or the Seven heroines of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai. It is the only story of fulfilled love and happiness and not of burning love and helpless search.  Overview  Jam Tamachi was a Samma prince, a ruler of Sindh, Thatta, Pakistan. There are three lakes lying between Jherruk and Thatta, called the Keenjhar, the Chholmari and Sonahri. On the banks of Keenjhar, broken walls are still visible that mark the site of an old fishing village. A girl of this class, Noori, attracts the attention of Jam Tamachi, who madly fell in love with her and raised her above the ladies of royal blood. She was also called Gandri, her clean name. This legend has been retold countless times and is often used as metaphor for divine love by Sufis. Its most beautiful rendering is in found in poetic compendium Shah Jo Risalo of Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai. By this anecdote, Shah shows that humility is great thing and is meant to rise in the favour of the creator.  Noori's grave  According to the legend, Noori was buried in the middle of Keenjhar Lake, Pakistan. Her last resting place is visited by hundreds of tourists daily.

In 1981 he received the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism. Background and education Yardley was born on October 27, 1939 in Pittsburgh. His father, William Woolsey Yardley, was a teacher of English and the classics, as well as an Episcopal minister and a headmaster at two East Coast private schools. His mother was Helen Gregory Yardley. Yardley graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was the editor of the student newspaper, The Daily Tar Heel, in 1961. Yardley is married to biographer/novelist Marie Arana, the former editor of Washington Post Book World. His sons, Jim Yardley and William Yardley, with his first wife Rosemary Roberts, are New York Times reporters, and William writes for the Los Angeles Times as well. He and his son Jim are one of two father-son recipients of the Pulitzer Prize. Career After leaving Chapel Hill, Yardley interned at the New York Times as assistant to James Reston, the columnist and Washington Bureau chief. From 1964 to 1974, Yardley worked as an editorial writer and book reviewer at the Greensboro Daily News; during this time, he was also a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University, academic year 1968-1969, where he studied American literature and literary biography. From 1974 to 1978, Yardley served as book editor of the Miami Herald. From 1978 to 1981, he was the book critic at the Washington Star, receiving a Pulitzer Prize for distinguished criticism in 1981. In 1981, Yardley became book critic and columnist at the Washington Post. Yardley is the author of several books, among them biographies of Frederick Exley and Ring Lardner. His memoir about his family, Our Kind of People, describes his parents' 50-year marriage and casts a wry eye on the American WASP experience. He edited H.L. Mencken's posthumous literary and journalistic memoir, My Life as Author and Editor. He has written introductions to books by Graham Greene, A. J. Liebling, Booth Tarkington and others. Yardley is known simultaneously as a scathingly frank critic and a starmaker. Among the talents he has brought to public light and championed are Michael Chabon, Edward P. Jones, Anne Tyler, William Boyd, Olga Grushin and John Berendt. He wrote a famously harsh review of Joe McGinniss' book The Last Brother: The Rise and Fall of Teddy Kennedy, saying \\"Not merely is it a textbook example of shoddy journalistic and publishing ethics; it is also a genuinely, unrelievedly rotten book, one without a single redeeming virtue, an embarrassment that should bring nothing except shame to everyone associated with it.\\"Subject: Why Spill Vitriol on Such a Squalid Screed? In February 2003, Yardley began a series called \\"Second Reading\\", described as ‚ÄúAn occasional series in which The Post‚Äôs book critic reconsiders notable and/or neglected books from the past.‚Äù Every month or so, for the next seven years, he published essays about notable books from the past, many of which had gone out of print or were in some way seen as worth reading again. It was in this series that he gained attention for his highly critical look at The Catcher in the Rye in 2004. A collection of the Second Reading columns was published by Europa Editions in July 2011. On December 5, 2014, Yardley announced his retirement as book critic of the Post. Awards Yardley was awarded the 1981 Pulitzer Prize for Criticism. Yardley has been a Nieman Fellow. Yardley was awarded an honorary doctorate of letters by George Washington University in 1987, and a distinguished alumnus award by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1989.

The sweet mass is then packed tightly into an earthenware pot or plastic jars and the opening is usually sealed off to prevent air from entering. After 7‚Äì15 days also depending upon the temperature, the fermentation is complete and the mass is converted to mandokpenaa thee. The time mandokpenaa thee is left to remain undisturbed in the pot after completion of fermentation leads to maturing of the mandokpenaa thee. During the maturing the flavours and taste intensifies yet become more mellowed. Traditionally, it is stored for about six months. It is consumed in a unique way: the fermented millet is put in a container, also traditionally called a Tongba, and boiled water is poured in it to the brim. It is then left undisturbed for about five minutes. Once the five minutes has passed it is ready to drink. A fine bamboo straw with a blind end, but perforated on the side to act as a filter, is inserted into the container to suck out the warm water and alcohol from the millet grains. More hot water is added as the tongba becomes dry, and the process is repeated until the alcohol is exhausted.

It is technically known as the Alaska Department of Public Safety Training Academy and also the DPS Academy. In addition to state troopers, it trains municipal police officers, state park rangers, fire marshals, and Village public safety officers (VPSOs). Staff The DPS Academy is typically commanded by a state trooper lieutenant, with a state trooper sergeant serving as the deputy commander. There are generally four to six state trooper corporals who serve as staff instructors. There are four civilian, non- commissioned, employees who perform administrative, logistical, and maintenance duties. Training The initial phase of a trooper recruit's academy training is known as the Alaska Law Enforcement Training program, or ALET. The ALET program is a residential, para-military style training program lasting approximately 16 weeks. The students attending an ALET class are a mixture of state trooper recruits, municipal and airport police officers, state park rangers, village public safety officers, state fire marshals, and self paying recruits. All of these students receive the same course of instruction, regardless of which agency employs them. Below is a listing of some of the subjects that make up the ALET curriculum: *Constitutional and procedural law *Search and seizure laws *Alaska Criminal Code *Officer safety skills *Traffic laws *Emergency vehicle operations *Crash investigation *Handgun training *Liquor laws *Juvenile laws and procedures *First aid and CPR *Report writing *Traffic stops *Shotgun training *Patrol rifle training *Building searches *Crime scene investigations *Interviewing techniques *DUI enforcement *Domestic violence crimes *Sexual assault investigations *Health and fitness *Verbal communications *Radio procedures *Personal defensive tactics In addition to the above subjects, ALET students also participate in daily physical fitness activities which may include strength training, running, and swimming. The ALET program uses a series of written tests and scenario-based exercises to measure the academic and practical performance of its students. =Trooper-specific training= The ALET graduation ceremonies mark the end of academy training for all municipal officers, fire marshals, and park rangers. While these students get to go home, state trooper recruits stay at the academy for two more weeks of training. This period of instruction, known as the Trooper Basic Course, involves classes that are tailored to the specific expectations and duties of Alaska State Troopers. Among the classes taught are: *Department history *Department policies and procedures *Wildlife Regulations and Investigation *Wilderness survival *Search and rescue management Because the duties of Alaska State Troopers often require them to travel to remote wilderness areas in small planes, boats, or on snowmachines, each trooper recruit receives instruction in wilderness survival and cold water survival techniques. This instruction includes a three-day/two-night survival field exercise conducted on an island near Sitka. The Alaska DPS Academy is the only state law enforcement academy in the nation to provide this type of training for its recruits. Upon graduation from the Trooper Basic Course the trooper recruits are transferred to an urban patrol unit where they will begin a 15-week-long field training program. At the conclusion of the field training program the trooper recruit is qualified to work alone, but remains on a probationary status until he or she completes one year of service.

It was discovered on 6 February 1938, by Finnish astronomer Yrj√∂ V√§is√§l√§ at the Iso-Heikkil√§ Observatory in Finland. The asteroid was named after L. L. Zamenhof, the creator of Esperanto. It is a recognized Zamenhof- Esperanto object.  Orbit and classification  Zamenhof is a Themistian asteroid that belongs to the Themis family (), a very large family of carbonaceous asteroids, named after 24 Themis. It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.8‚Äì3.5 AU once every 5 years and 7 months (2,042 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 1¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at the discovering observatory, one month prior to its official discovery observation.  Physical characteristics  The Lightcurve Data Base assumes Zamenhof to be a common, carbonaceous C-type asteroid, in agreement with the overall spectral type of the Themis family. = Rotation period = Two rotational lightcurves of Zamenhof were obtained from photometric observations in 2006 and 2011. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 10.2 and 10.4 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.15 and 0.30 magnitude, respectively (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Zamenhof measures between 25.91 and 27.645 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.087 and 0.121. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.0891 and a diameter of 25.62 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.2.  Naming  This minor planet was named after L. L. Zamenhof (1859‚Äì1917), a Polish-Jewish ophthalmologist and creator of Esperanto, a constructed international language. This asteroid and 1421 Esperanto are considered to be the most remote Zamenhof-Esperanto objects (a monument or a place celebrating Zamenhof). The official was published by the Minor Planet Center in January 1956 ().

The young queens of the species invade the nests of other species, such as the red imported fire ant (RIFA) (Solenopsis invicta). This is made possible by the fact that the S. daguerrei queen produces pheromones which are very similar to those produced by the queens of the host species. The young queen finds a queen of the host species and latches onto it, eating the food intended for the host queen and slowly killing it. The S. daguerrei queen then begins laying eggs. These are taken care of by the host ants, sometimes preferentially to their own brood. S. daguerrei only produce winged virgin queens and males. No workers are needed, since these are provided by the host species. The winged ants fly off to mate and invade new colonies. S. daguerrei is being considered as a potential biological control agent for RIFA, which is an invasive species in many parts of the world. As of 2006, work is underway to find methods of rearing the ants in sufficient numbers to be released into the wild to reduce RIFA populations. In their native South America about 1-4% of the RIFA colonies are infested with S. daguerrei.

Muhammad Ali Khan Wallajah was born to Anwaruddin Muhammed Khan, by his second wife, Fakhr un-nisa Begum Sahiba, a niece of Sayyid Ali Khan Safavi ul-Mosawi of Persia, sometime Naib suba of Trichonopoly, on 7 July 1717 at Delhi. Muhammed Ali Khan Wallajah the Nawab of Arcot often referred to himself as the Subedar of the Carnatic in his letters and correspondence with the then Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II. Official name His official name was Amir ul Hind, Walla Jah, 'Umdat ul-Mulk, Asaf ud-Daula, Nawab Muhammad 'Ali Anwar ud-din Khan Bahadur, Zafar Jang, Sipah-Salar, Sahib us-Saif wal-qalam Mudabbir-i-Umur-i-'Alam Farzand-i-'Aziz-az Jan, Biradarbi Jan-barabar [Nawab Jannat Aramgah], Subadar of the Carnatic.  Life  George Willison (1775). Muhammad Ali Khan Wallajah was granted the titles of \\"Siraj ud-Daula\\", Anwar ud-din Khan Bahadur, and Dilawar Jang, together with the Subadarship of the Carnatic Payeen Ghaut and a mensab of 5,000 zat and 5,000 sowar, the Mahi Maratib, Naubat, etc. by Imperial firman on 5 April 1750. He joined forces with Nasir Jung and the British in opposing Chanda Sahib, the French nominee for the Subadarship. He was defeated by the French at Gingee in December 1750, and fled to Trichnopoly for a second time. He received an Imperial firman confirming his possession of the Carnatic and appointing him as Naib to Viceroy of the Deccan, 21 January 1751. Raised to the titles of Walla Jah and Sahib us-Saif wal-qalam Mudabbir-i-Umur-i-'Alam Farzand-i-'Aziz-az Jan by Emperor Shah Alam II in 1760, he was recognised by the Treaty of Paris as an independent ruler in 1763 and by the Emperor of Delhi 26 August 1765. Sir John Macpherson, writing to Lord Macartney in November 1781 declared, \\"I love the old man...mind me to my old Nabob. I have been sending him sheep and bags of rice by every ship. It is more than he did for me when I was fighting his battles.\\" The Nawab was an ally of the British East India Company, but also harboured great ambitions of power in the South Indian arena, where Hyder Ali of the Mysore, the Marathas, and the Nizam of Hyderabad were constant rivals. The Nawab could also be unpredictable and devious, and his breach of promise in failing to surrender Tiruchirappalli to Hyder Ali in 1751 was at the root of many confrontations between Hyder Ali and the British. When Hyder Ali swept into the Carnatic towards Arcot on 23 July 1780, with an army estimated at 86‚Äì100,000 men, it was not the Nawab, however, but the British who had provoked Hyder Ali's wrath, by seizing the French port of Mah√© which was under his protection. Much of the ensuing war was fought on the Nawab's territory. Wallajah witness two of Tipu Sultan sons being taken hostage to Vellore, by Mather Brown (1795). For the defence of his territory, the Nawab paid the British 400,000 pagodas per annum (about ¬£160,000) and 10 out of the 21 battalions of the Madras army were posted to garrison his forts. The British derived income from his jagirs (land grants). Political influence For a period the situation of the Nawab was a significant factor in Westminster politics. The Nawab had borrowed heavily; and many East India Company officials, in India or in the United Kingdom, were his creditors. Elections in the UK could be, and were, influenced by nabob money, with the result that a group of about a dozen Members of Parliament formed a discernible \\"Arcot interest\\", as it was called. By the 1780s issues affecting Arcot were therefore having a direct impact on British politics: the debts of the Nawab mattered in domestic terms. Death He died from gangrene poisoning, at Madras on 13 October 1795. He was buried outside the gate of the Gunbad of Shah Chand Mastan, Trichinopoly. He was succeeded by his son Umdat ul-Umara, who was later accused of supporting Tipu Sultan the heir of Hyder Ali during the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War.

Occurring in Europe in spring, A. verna associates with various deciduous and coniferous trees. The caps, stipes and gills are all white in colour. Taxonomy Amanita verna was first mentioned in the scientific literature by French mycologist Jean Bulliard in 1780 as form vernus of Agaricus bulbosus. Bulliard warned that it could be easily confused with the edible field mushroom (Agaricus campestris), and that remedies for those who had eaten it included putting vitriolic ether in wine or crushed garlic in milk. The species name verna is derived from the Latin word for \\"spring\\". Three years later, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck gave it distinct species status in his Encyclop√©die M√©thodique, Botanique. The fool's mushroom (Amanita verna), also known as the spring destroying angel or death angel, is a close relative of Amanita phalloides, the death cap, and a member of the mushroom genus Amanita. Amanita verna, like its close relative, belongs to the subfamily Phalloideae. Description The fool's mushroom is pure white, all the way to the gills and the stipe. This fungus, like all amanitas, has a volva. The fool's mushroom's cap is wide, and is about the same height. This mushroom's lamellae is free and white, and the volva is bag-like and large. Its annulus is white and membranous, and A. verna react yellow with 20% potassium hydroxide solution, unlike its relative Amanita phalloides var. alba while Amanita virosa gets an orangeyellow reaction. The mushroom's spores are smooth and elliptical. Habitat and season The fool's mushroom grows in European woodlands and hardwood forests in springtime as the fungus' Latin name (Amanita verna or spring destroying angel) suggests. Unlike various closely related poisonous amanitas, this mushroom is not known to occur in North America. Toxicity Closely related to other deadly pure white amanitas, the fool's mushroom is one of the most poisonous mushrooms in the world. Just like the death cap, this organism contains a fatal dose of alpha-amanitin, which causes liver failure if not treated immediately. While this mushroom (along with many other deadly and edible fungi) also contains phallotoxins, these phallotoxins are not toxic to humans (when ingested) as they are poorly absorbed. This mushroom's toxicity and symptoms are similar, if not identical to that of the death cap. Like other members of the subfamily Phalloideae, the fool's mushroom has been implicated in a number of serious or fatal poisonings. There are no negative symptoms from eating this fungus until 6‚Äì24 hours after ingestion. The first symptom is simply unease. Violent cramps and diarrhea follow. On the third day, the same symptoms repeat themselves, but while to many this may seem like a sign of recovery, most of the time it is simply a herald of the final onset of symptoms, which include kidney and liver failure due to amatoxins. At this point, drastic measures like liver transplants need to be taken, or the victim would most likely die.

The station's studio is located at the 3rd Floor, ACQ Tower (formerly Jacinta Building I/NBC Tower), Santa Rita Street, EDSA, Guadalupe Nuevo, Makati City (which is the former home of DZAM/Angel Radyo) and its transmitter is located in M. Sioson Street, Barangay Dampalit, Malabon City. This station operates daily from 4:00 AM to 12:00 MN. History In August 1972, DZXX is the flagship station in the Greater Manila Area, with a 5 kW transmitter output. In 1975, it changed its call letters to DWXX (Double X) 1000 kHz (later moved to 1026 kHz in 1978) and it was then a sister station of DZBB 594 kHz, featuring a pop music format. Later on, Hypersonic Broadcasting Center acquired the station from the Republic Broadcasting System (now GMA Network) while DWXX 1026 is the last broadcast on April 15, 1987. On May 10, 1987, when Nation Broadcasting Corporation took over the 1026 AM frequency, it was rebranded as DZAM Radyo 1026: Ating Maaasahan, which would also rebrand later as DZAM Radyo Commando. During that period, the station operated with 10 kW output, and it featured a uniform network type format (a.k.a. TV-on-radio format), consisting of news, and well-balanced mix of talk, music and entertainment programming for listeners of all ages; as well as live coverage of PBA games at that time. In 1998, after NBC was acquired by PLDT's MediaQuest Holdings from the consortium led by the Yabut family and real estate magnate Manny Villar, DZAM later changed its callsign as DZAR and relaunched as Angel Radyo, with an upgraded 25 kW signal, followed by the switch to news and talkback format. Some of the personalities who worked for Angel Radyo were TV personalities Boy Abunda, TG Kintanar, Gerry Geronimo, Angelique Lazo, Showbiz columnist Jobert Sucaldito, columnist Rina Jimenez-David, former PBA commissioner Noli Eala and former MMDA General Manager Tim Orbos. In 2005, international televangelist Pastor Apollo C. Quiboloy purchased all of NBC's AM stations under the Swara Sug Media Corporation's platform. All of the NBC AM stations that Quiboloy purchased were in turn rebranded as Sonshine Radio. At that time its studios moved from NBC Tower/Jacinta Building in EDSA, Guadalupe, Makati City to Jollibee Plaza Building in Ortigas Center, Pasig City, and finally upgraded to its current 50 kW output, with its news, talk and religious programming.Higher rice output via radio Its 50,000 watt broadcast signal is heard in its territorial limits (Metro Manila), and is the only Philippine station heard all over the world live via satellite through Globecast and through the Internet at its website, thus the tag \\"Dinig sa buong mundo\\" (Heard all over the world). In 2012, DZAR studios moved back from Jollibee Plaza Building in Ortigas Center, Pasig City to the new home ACQ Tower (formerly NBC Tower/Jacinta Building) in EDSA, Guadalupe, Makati City.

Released in 1966, the song reached number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in September of that year and remained in the top position for three weeks. Billboard ranked the record as the No. 7 song of 1966. In Canada, the song also reached number one. Session musician Doug Rhodes, also member of The Music Machine, played the celesta on the recording. Studio player Ben Benay played guitar on the recording. Curt Boettcher added some vocals, most notably the high-pitched \\"told you\\" and \\"hold you\\" on the final verse. The track was recorded at a converted garage studio owned by Gary S. Paxton, who engineered the sessions along with Pete Romano. The single release of the song was slightly edited by removing one of the two \\"And I do cherish you\\" lines near the end of the song. This edit was done as a means of keeping the track from exceeding the three-minute mark, as radio programmers of the era frowned upon songs that went beyond three minutes. However, even with the edit, the song still ran over. Instead of editing further, producer Curt Boettcher intentionally listed \\"3:00\\" on the label as the song's running time. In 2012, original Association member Jim Yester said the record label claimed the song sounded \\"too old and archaic\\", but quipped that the song's success \\"just showed we can have archaic and eat it, too.\\"Steve Palisin, \\"The Association teams up with Long Bay Symphony,\\" The Sun News, October 19, 2012.

His version reached number nine on the Hot 100 chart, and spent one week at number one on the Adult Contemporary chart. and peaked at number three in Canada and hit number one in both Australia and New Zealand. In the UK, it was issued as a double A-side with \\"Could It Be Forever\\", and peaked at number 2 in the UK Singles Chart. It was his debut hit(s) in that country. The recording sold over one million copies in the US. Other versions Other artists to have covered the song include Dizzy Gillespie (The Melody Lingers On album), The Lettermen, Nina Simone, Ed Ames, Petula Clark (Colour My World album), Rita Wilson (AM/FM album), The Four Tops (Reach Out album), Carla Thomas (Love Means... album), Jodeci, Barry Manilow, Pat Metheny, Kenny Rogers and The First Edition, and Glee which incorporates elements from the Madonna song with the same title.

Working out of labs at both the Illinois Institute of Technology and Rush University Hospital, Sher's team recruited 160 participants (approximately 35% minorities, 30% women) in which one member suffered from a cardiovascular event (e.g., myocardial infarction, bypass graft surgery, angioplasty). Using a short term couples intervention strategy designed to optimize relationships and reduce interpersonal stress, the team focused on three areas of change: exercise, weight management, and compliance with lipid-lowering medication. These areas were targeted because of the difficulty many cardiac patients face in maintaining long-term commitments to change. Currently, Sher is interested in applying what she has learned from previous work to a much wider population of patients through the use of the Internet and telephone. She is particularly interested in reaching patients who do not have the time or resources to participate in intensive out-patient groups.

They cover eight key areas of development and include a particular focus on the protection of Kosovo non-Albanian ethnic communities. The Standards address issues of related to functioning democratic institutions, rule of law, rights of communities, returns of displaced persons, the economy, dialogue with Belgrade, property rights and the Kosovo Protection Corps. In 2003, the international community articulated a policy of \\"Standards before status,\\" whereby it was decided that Kosovo's status would not be addressed until it had met these Standards of good governance. To meet these goals, Kosovo's Provisional Institutions of Self-Government (PISG) created a series of working groups that met regularly to speed progress on the Standards. In 2005, a UN-commissioned report by Norwegian diplomat Kai Eide assessed that further progress on the Standards would not be possible until Kosovo had clarity about its future status. In 2006, as the Kosovo Status Process was underway, the government of Kosovo (part of the PISG) began to transition its work on the Standards into the more demanding process of meeting standards for European integration as part of the Stabilization and Association Process Tracking Mechanism (STM).

In modern usage in Japan, \\"ameonna\\" (or the male equivalent \\"ameotoko\\") refers to an unlucky person that seems to be jinxed to have the rain follow them wherever they may go, thus gaining a reputation for ruining special events such as weddings or sporting events. Origins In the collection of y≈çkai pictures, the Konjaku Hyakki Sh≈´i by Toriyama Sekien, there is a picture titled \\"ameonna,\\" and the explanatory text says \\"in Fuzan (Wu Shan), China, the goddesses become a cloud in morning and rain in the evening. The ameoona is probably like one of these\\" („ÇÇ„Çç„Åì„ÅóÂ∑´Â±±„ÅÆÁ•ûÂ•≥„ÅØ Êúù„Å´„ÅØÈõ≤„Å®„Å™„Çä Â§ï„Å´„ÅØÈõ®„Å®„Å™„Çã„Å®„Åã„ÇÑ Èõ®Â•≥„ÇÇ„Åã„Åã„ÇãÈ°û„ÅÆ„ÇÇ„ÅÆ„Å™„Çä„ÇÑ). This quotes from an episode in the Gaotangfu (È´òÂîêË≥¶) by the Chu literati Song Yu, wherein King Huai of Chu had a dream about falling in love with a woman in Wu Shan who, before leaving, left the words \\"I will be clouds in the morning, and rain in the evening, so at morning and evening, let's meet down at the balcony,\\" and ÊúùÈõ≤ÊöÆÈõ® (Chaoyunmuyu in Chinese, Ch≈çunb≈ç in Japanese), written as \\"morning cloud evening rain,\\" is an old chengyu (Chinese proverb) referring to secret relations between a man and woman. There are no statements about any rain-related y≈çkai to be seen, so it's been suggested that the ameonna is simply a made-up creation by Sekien in order to satirize the Edo Period Yoshiwara Y≈´kaku. There is also the idea put forth that women who lose their recently born children on a day of rain due to a kamikakushi (spiriting away) would become rain women (ameonna), so they would appear before crying children carrying a large sack. Sometimes, they are considered a \\"bothersome y≈çkai that calls forth rain,\\" but they are also sometimes considered a holy \\"rain god\\" as a \\"y≈çkai who saves people by calling forth rain\\" in times of continuing drought by making it rain. In Shimoina District, Nagano Prefecture, there is an eerie woman called \\"yukionba\\" (Èõ®„Åä„Çì„Å∞) said to appear on rainy nights, and it has been supposed that they are a y≈çkai that kidnaps children, or a god that visits on rainy days who has fallen and turned into a y≈çkai, among other suggestions.

He was born on 7 November 1790 in the village of ≈ªyrmuny near Lida, in what is now the Hrodna Voblast of Belarus. He graduated from the prestigious Polish Liceum Krzemienieckie and the Imperial University of Vilna. Between 1814 and 1816 he continued his studies on architecture in St. Petersburg, where he became the first Pole on the Imperial Academy of Arts. Between 1817 and 1819 he also travelled to Western European countries, visiting K√∂nigsberg, Danzig, Berlin, Paris, Naples, Venice and Vienna before returning to Cracow. Upon his return to Vilnius he was offered a chair of architecture, which he accepted. Among his most notable architectural works are the refurbishment of the interior of the Vilna University (1802-1804), including the Aula's interior, Evangelical Reformers' Church (1829-1835) and the neoclassical Jan ≈öniadecki's manor in Ja≈°i≈´nai (reconstructed between 1824 and 1828). Yet another of his major works was the neo-Palladian Tusculanum manor (in modern ≈Ωirm≈´nai, Vilnius), completed in 1825. The entire ≈Ωirm≈´nai microdistrict in Vilnius was named after his native village, a part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth at the time of his birth. As a noted architect, Podczaszy≈Ñski also supervised a number of other projects, among them the reconstruction of the Palace of Governors in Vilnius, carried out by Vasily Stasov. In modern times the palace serves as the seat of the President of Lithuania. Podczaszy≈Ñski has also reconstructed the Orthodox Cathedral of the Theotokos into the Anatomicum of his alma mater (1822). Finally, between 1836 and 1838 he designed the interior design of three chapels of the St. W≈Çadys≈Çaw and Stanis≈Çaw Cathedral of Vilna. In 1839, Karol Podczaszy≈Ñski took the first known daguerreotype in present-day Lithuania. Several photographs of Vilnius' constructions of the 1860s As a theoretician, Podczaszy≈Ñski authored works on architecture and industrial design. Karol Podczaszy≈Ñski died on 19 April 1860 in Vilnius and was interred in Rasos Cemetery. Karol's son, Boles≈Çaw Podczaszy≈Ñski also became a noted architect. Publications Among the best- known of his publications are monographs on industrial design: *On the beauty of works of industry (; 1821) *Application of general principles of excellence of industrial designs in paintings, sculptures and garden design (; 1838) He also prepared dictionary of Polish carpentry terms ( 1843). Karol Podczaszy≈Ñski was also the author of two handbooks of architecture for universities: one for professors (1822) and one for the students (published in three volumes between 1828 and 1856). Karol's son, Boles≈Çaw Podczaszy≈Ñski also became a noted architect.

The film, produced and directed by Lane Nishikawa is a fictionalized account of the rescue of the Lost Battalion. Plot In 1953, Jimmy Takata (Nishikawa) suffers from \\"battle fatigue\\" (posttraumatic stress disorder), to the great concern of his wife, Mary (Tomita). Raised in Hawaii, Takata and some of his friends enlisted in the 100th Battalion, serving in the European Theater of Operations. In a series of flashbacks, he remembers the war and events in his life surrounding it. Following a head injury, he begins to have visions, and believes that he is seeing memories of other men, including his friend Freddy Watada (Watanabe) as he courted Mary (who would later be Jimmy's wife) before entering the Army. Freddy receives a \\"million-dollar wound\\" (one which is serious enough to require evacuation to the United States, but not permanently disabling), and he shows Takata an engagement ring, purchased before being sent to Europe, which he intends to give Mary upon his return. Takata's concern about the visions is dismissed as disorientation caused by the head wound by \\"Doc\\" Naganuma, the unit medic, a Medical Doctor who had likewise joined to help his friends. Takata also has a vision of his father, a Buddhist priest in Federal custody, and who tells him \\"You must accept your fate, here\\"‚Äîpointing to his head -- \\"the rest of you will follow, here,\\" pointing to Takata's heart. Takata later learns that his father has died, 49 days earlier. Buddhists believe that a spirit will enter Heaven or be reborn 49 days after death. When his unit is ordered to break through German lines and rescue the 141st Infantry Regiment, Takata is ordered by the doctor to stay in the rear area, due to his head wound. However, as the casualties mount, he defies orders and attempts to find a way through to the trapped men. He is joined by several of his men (including Freddy), who are also unwilling to wait in the rear as their friends face the danger. Asked by a newly transferred soldier if he's ever afraid, Takata confides that his fear is of losing more men. Joining the rest of the Nisei, Takata and his men fight the Germans, as one-by-one Takata watches his men‚Äînearly all of his friends‚Äîbeing killed in battle. Freddy throws his body on a grenade which had been thrown at Takata, and the men look into each other's eyes as it explodes. The battle won, Takata accepts the thanks of the lieutenant commanding the rescued unit, and notes that 211 of the 275 had been saved, at a cost of over 800 casualties. His thoughts return to 1953, where Mary's love and tears finally break through, and he is able to shed his own tears. A vision comes of his lost men and father, standing in the field hospital, and his father repeats his earlier encouraging statement. Now Takata's vision comes of meeting with Mary after the war, and meeting Mary and Freddy's young daughter, Joanie. Joanie touches the scar on his temple, and as she smiles and looks into his eyes, he is reminded of a refugee girl that he had rescued in the battle which had resulted in the head wound. Takata gives Mary the engagement ring, and explains that, since Freddy had given his life to save Takata's, the least he could do is to bring it home for her. He comforts her as she cries. As that vision fades, we see Jimmy placing the keepsakes from each of his friends in a suitcase and closing it. Mary, sitting behind the wheel of a car, looks up and asks (hoping beyond hope) if he is okay. He looks at her, is able to smile, and says that he is.

At its closure, its assets were donated to the University of Massachusetts system to become the basis for the University of Massachusetts School of Law. Location The law school was located in North Dartmouth, Massachusetts, between New Bedford, Massachusetts and Fall River, Massachusetts. History Southeastern Massachusetts-Rhode Island-Avins Law School was incorporated in 1981, offering weekend classes from a storefront location in Fall River. It adopted the name \\"Southern New England School of Law\\" in 1986 and won authorization to confer the Juris Doctor degree in 1988. The first graduation was held in 1989. A full-time day program was established in 1992, and the School moved to its Faunce Corner Road campus in North Dartmouth in 1994. It became accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges in 1995. At its closure in 2010, it had 200 students, 1200 alumni, 13 full-time faculty and over 20 adjunct instructors. =Affiliation with University of Massachusetts= In 2005, the University of Massachusetts system trustees considered but rejected a proposal to create a UMass Law School by merging SNESL with UMass Dartmouth. Prior to the school's incorporation into the University of Massachusetts system, students enrolled at Southern New England School of Law had the option of completing a dual JD/MBA program. The MBA (Business School) component was offered at the nearby University of Massachusetts Dartmouth campus. Full-time students enrolled in the joint program completed the course of study within four years or eight semesters. Additionally, UMass Dartmouth provided Southern New England School of Law students with dormitory arrangements, access to meal services, and use of the UMASS library, bookstore, and athletic facilities. On December 10, 2009, the Board of Trustees of the University of Massachusetts voted to have UMass Dartmouth acquire the law school from the law school trustees with the aim of creating a competitive and low cost alternative to private law schools in the area. Southern New England held its final commencement on May 29, 2010 and was succeeded by the University of Massachusetts School of Law at Dartmouth. Accreditation SNESL was accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. It was not accredited by the American Bar Association. Southern New England School of Law's accreditation status was the subject of a lawsuit, Joseph Rodi v. Southern New England School of Law, 532 F.3d 11 (1st Cir. 2008). Clinical programs Southern New England School of Law ran clinics offering legal services to individuals and organizations in Massachusetts on a pro bono basis. Clinics were led and organized by faculty and licensed attorneys, and allowed law students at SNESL to assist. The Immigration Law Clinic provided legal services to immigrants and community groups throughout Massachusetts. Clients were referred by several local agencies. Other SNESL clinics included the Community Development Clinic, designed to work with local non-profit organizations; and the Legal Services Clinic, located in one of the city‚Äôs legal services offices, The New Center for Legal Advocacy, in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Student associations The Student Bar Association served as the official student association of Southern New England School of Law. It sponsored academic, professional and social activities and brought guest speakers to the Law School. The Southern New England Roundtable Symposium Law Journal, a student organization, published an electronic law journal annually in the winter semester, \\"to contribute to the legal community by publishing articles that highlight current legal issues and changes in the law.\\" Other student organizations included Delta Theta Phi Law Fraternity, the Black Law Students Association (BLSA), the Legal Association of Women (LAW), the International Law Students Association (ILSA), the Moot Court Program, and the Yearbook.

It shipped September 22, 1999. The Rio 500 was the successor of the Rio PMP300, and provided a number of user requested features (including USB and higher audio quality). There were many reviews of the Rio 500. Features The Rio 500 was the first MP3 player to allow file transfer via USB cable, and PC & Mac support. It features 64 MB of flash memory available for music, has light blue backlight, ability to set bookmarks, has an expansion card slot (SmartMedia card) and is powered by one AA battery. It is roughly the size of a standard pack of playing cards. Subsequent firmware updates made better use of the available screen space by displaying additional track information including bitrate. Non-standard USB The Rio 500 has a USB port that looks like the standard 5-pin mini-B type, however it is not compatible with modern USB mini-B cables. The USB1.1 spec was released in September 1998 and the 500 didn't go on sale until a year later, however the spec for mini-B cables and receptacles was not established until October 2000. Before then, some digital cameras had adopted the mini-B connector using a pinout with the data lines reversed (relative to spec) and the +5V line disconnected; the Rio 500 also had adopted the pre-out October 2000 pinout. USB cables that were included with these devices usually had an arrow shape imprinted on the mini connector rather than the USB \\"trident\\" logo. Any cable used for the Rio 500 must have the +5V line (red wire) cut or it may cause damage when connected with a power source. Replacement Rio Part # 90260017-001 is available on eBay from several vendors. Software Support Diamond no longer provides support for the Rio, and the last version of Microsoft Windows to work with Diamond's Rio software was Windows 98/2000.

Life Bullock's name is mentioned in Downes's \\"Roscius Anglicanus.\\" He first appears in the cast of Colley Cibber's \\"Love's Last Shift,\\" produced by the associated companies of Drury Lane and Dorset Garden, 1696. In Cibber's piece he played Sly. He had joined the companies the previous year. Among his original characters were Sir Tunbelly Clumsy in the \\"Relapse,\\" 1697, and Soto in She Would and She Would Not 1702. He also played with success many parts in the plays of John Dryden, William Wycherley, Thomas Shadwell. Until 1706, he was at Drury Lane. He then went to the Haymarket, returning to Drury Lane in 1708. After another brief migration to the Haymarket, followed by a new return to Drury Lane, he quitted definitely the latter theatre, 1715‚Äì16, for Lincoln's Inn Fields, where he remained till 1726. He was the original Clincher in Farquhar's The Constant Couple (1699), Boniface in The Beaux' Stratagem (1707), and Sir Francis Courtall in Tavener's The Artful Wife (1717). In 1719 he appeared in Kensington Gardens by John Leigh. His death is said to have taken place on 18 June 1733, a date which has been accepted by most subsequent writers. He had a benefit, however, at Covent Garden on 6 January 1739, described on the bills as 'his first appearance on the stage for six years,' when he played Dominic in Dryden's \\"Spanish Fryar.\\" In his address to the public he pleaded his great age, upwards of threescore and twelve, as a reason for indulgence. He played again on 25 April 1739, for the benefit of Stephen, the Host in the \\"Merry Wives of Windsor,' a favourite character. He had, according to Genest, in the summer a booth at Bartholomew Fair, at which he acted. After this no more is heard of him. Family William Bullock had three sons, all actors, of whom the eldest was Christopher Bullock (c. 1690‚Äì1724), who at Drury Lane, the Haymarket and Lincoln's Inn Fields displayed \\"a considerable versatility of talent.\\" Christopher created a few original parts in comedies and farces of which he was the author or adapter:‚ÄîA Woman's Revenge (1715); Slip; Adventures of Half an Hour (1716); The Cobbler of Preston; Woman's a Riddle; The Perjurer (1717); and The Traitor (1718).

It was formed in 1969. The orchestra's Music Director is conductor and former trombonist with the Philharmonia Orchestra, Peter Bassano. The CRSO has 60 playing members, both amateur and professional musicians, who perform concerts at The Central Theatre, Chatham, and other venues in Kent. Recent concerts include a joint performance with Rochester Choral Society in Rochester Cathedral, with a programme that included Brahms's Schicksalslied and Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. The CRSO also includes chamber groups ‚Äî notably the piano quintet City of Rochester Chamber Ensemble ‚Äì which perform throughout Kent. The CRSO is a registered charity.  History  = 1969 to 1979 = After World War II, there were few opportunities for musicians in Medway to perform classical music together. In 1969 Bill Holtby began to work towards his dream of a local orchestra. His adventurous courage, hard work, dogged perseverance, and his ideals were to change the musical landscape in Medway. Under their conductor, James Clinch, also a skilled oboe player, the Rochester Arts Orchestra (RAO) was born, taking its name in part from the Medway College of Art who kindly provided the fledgling group with a rehearsal room at their temporary annex at the old St Peters School opposite Fort Pitt. At this point, the RAO was a string orchestra; rehearsals began in September 1969. No programme survives from the first concert of 14 October 1969, so we cannot be sure of the names of all the orchestra's members or their total number. We do, however, have a poster and appreciative letters, one from the Vicar of St Nicholas saying, \\"Many people have said to me how much they enjoyed the concert. I am delighted it was such a success\\". However, a crisis occurred when the advertised Leader of the orchestra never arrived on the night, and it seems nobody connected with the orchestra ever saw him again. Derek Webb \\"stood in\\" for the Leader minutes before the concert began and performed this vital role for the next 35 years. In 1971 orchestra was constituted as a society and registered as a charity. The orchestra gave three concerts in the name of RAO and two in Otham Church under the title, \\"Otham Festival Orchestra\\", all with James Clinch conducting. The first at Cobham Church on 8 May was notable because the Vicar announced there was to be no applause. Somewhat surprised, everyone dutifully complied! A concert on 18 November 1972 in St. Margaret's Church, Rochester, marked the next evolution in the intent of the orchestra; the RAO had wind instruments for the first time - oboes and horns - in a performance of Mozart's Symphony No 29. An important milestone in the early life of RAO was their first concert in Rochester Cathedral on Saturday 4 May 1974 with Martin Hughes deputising for James Clinch, who was convalescing following back surgery. A report in the local press ran: \\"Rochester Arts Orchestra ... has in the few years of its existence reached a standard of performance which would be a credit to any community ... last Saturday's concert was a success as evidenced by the ovation from the audience.\\" On 15 November 1975 an all-Beethoven concert was recorded in the Cathedral by BBC Radio Medway. This was transmitted on Sunday 25 January 1976. In 1977, with thirty concerts behind it, the orchestra took on its biggest challenge yet; a concert on Saturday 26 February in Medway's major concert venue, Chatham's Central Hall. An all-Brahms programme featured the Tragic Overture, Derek Collier as soloist in the Violin Concerto, and the Symphony No 4. Musically, the concert was a great success; sadly, the same could not be said for audience numbers. The reviewer from the 'Evening Post' summed it up in his headline: \\"Where, oh where were the people?\\" On Saturday 19 May 1979, the soloist in Weber's Clarinet Concerto No.2 was Jack Brymer. He consented to becoming the orchestra's President. = 1980 to 1999 = In 1980 a new RAO logo appeared for the first time on the front of the programmes. The logo was designed by Bill Holtby and used in all orchestra publicity until the official name of the orchestra was changed. The first 1980 concert, the orchestra's fortieth, was on 18 February and publicised as an \\"Edward Elgar Concert\\" with Christopher Van Kampen the soloist in the Cello Concerto. The local press reported: \\"On this showing the Rochester Arts Orchestra deserves all the support that we can give. It is a group of which any town in the country would be proud.\\" 'Last Night of the Proms' was the billing for the first RAO concert of 1988. A review of the concert in Chatham News headed 'First-class fun at Proms' Last Night' was very generous: \\"The orchestra performed classic Proms music in its first concert of the year, which was rapturously received by a full house at the Central Hall, Chatham, on Saturday night ... The applause was deafening and the audience was jumping up and down by the end, demanding encore after encore.\\" By this time the orchestra featured more than 80 musicians. On 28 November 1994 RAO celebrated its 25th Silver Jubilee with an \\"Elgar Concert\\". The local press previewed the concert, reporting poignantly that \\"It will be one of the last concerts conducted by James Clinch who feels it is time to hand over the baton to a younger man.\\" 20 May 1995 saw founder-conductor James Clinch's final concert. This was reported by a local paper under the heading: \\"Conductor lays down baton\\" alongside a photograph of a beaming \\"Jimmy\\" seated at the podium during a break in rehearsals in the Central Hall. He had just conducted RAO's ninety-ninth concert. Warwick Potter took over from James Clinch, and held the position for five years. During this time he conducted a memorable series of concerts featuring Rachmaninov's 2nd and 3rd Symphonies and Symphonic Dances. In 2002 the membership voted overwhelmingly in favour of changing the orchestra's name to the City of Rochester Symphony Orchestra. = 2000 onwards = The twenty- first century began with a concert sponsored by the Friends, including Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante. During this season the Friends awarded Honorary Membership to Dr. Andrew Ashbee in appreciation of the pre-concert talks and concert programme notes delivered during many years. In 2000 Harry Curtis was appointed as the orchestra's new conductor. The following year a symphonic work was commissioned from composer Tom Armstrong based on maritime themes and the Historic Dockyard. Pupils from Cliffe Woods School took part in workshops with Tom, as part of the orchestra's continuing education outreach work, composing a piece for percussion and recorders which they performed in the concert. 2002 was a year sadly marked by the sudden death of Terry Hill, writer of the previous orchestra history, and long-term playing member. CRSO welcomed the winner of the Haverhill Competition for the first time on 1 March 03, pianist Marisa Gupta. An important milestone in the continuing development of CRSO was the appointment of Michael Thompson as Principal Conductor in 2003. The summer saw a successful joint concert with Medway Youth Orchestra. However CRSO was sad to hear news of the death of their much admired President, Jack Brymer, and the untimely death of Maureen Harrison, principal cellist for most of the orchestra's life and, with husband Paul, a very active member of the Friends. In May, Derek Webb, the orchestra's leader retired, and was succeeded, from amongst the players, by the Lindsey Purcell. The orchestra returned to Rochester Cathedral in 2005 giving a sell-out concert as part of the Rotary Clubs' centenary celebrations. The end of the Season saw the retirement of Bernard Parris who had served as Chairman of the Orchestra since 1998. Bernard was succeeded by CRSO Friend Dr. Ellie Johnson-Searle. Richard Hickox, Musical Director of the City of London Sinfonia accepted an invitation to become the orchestra's new president, helping to focus both orchestras' joint quest to extend access to live classical music in Medway. In the summers of 2007 and 2008 the CRSO performed at the Snodland Summer Festival. Following five years as principal conductor Michael Thompson handed the baton to Peter Bassano and Tony Halstead who each conducted concerts with the orchestra during the next season. Peter Bassano was appointed Principal Conductor and with it the new title of Musical Director in 2009. Under Bassano the CRSO has broadened its repertoire to include music by Britten, P√§rt, Prokofiev, Rautavaara, Souster, Stravinsky, Tippett and Walton, as well as introducing new works from student composers in the orchestra‚Äôs special relationship with the University of Kent and the Royal College of Music. Bassano‚Äôs interest in historic performance informs his interpretation of baroque and classical repertoire and works by Vivaldi, Mozart and Beethoven have featured regularly in CRSO concerts. He continues to develop an appropriate musical style for different periods of repertoire ensuring that Rachmaninov has a radically different orchestral sound to Mozart.

When Comedy Central began in the early 1990s, Rhodes became the first comedian spokesperson they signed. Much of his commercial success came during this time. He was later the star of NBC's Mr. Rhodes, Dutch Yorin Television's Kevin Masters Show starring Tom Rhodes and Yorin Travel. In addition to venues in the United States, Rhodes has also performed in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Beijing, Shanghai, Jakarta, Bali, London, Berlin, Munich, Zurich, Lausanne, Vancouver, Stockholm, Sydney, Melbourne, Basel, Geneva, Copenhagen, and Toronto. His podcast Tom Rhodes Radio often features other comedians or people he meets while traveling. He writes for The Huffington Post Destinations section and often documents his travels on his YouTube page. He has released three comedy albums, the most recent being Colossus of Me in 2012, and two DVDs which feature his performances and interviews with locals across the world. Career =Stand- up comedy= Rhodes was introduced to stand-up at age 12 when his father took him to a local D.C. comedy club to see his Uncle Bob perform. Because Tom was wearing a Washington Redskins jacket, another comedian pulled him up onstage and interviewed Tom as if he were the Redskins football coach. He claims this was the moment he fell in love with stand-up comedy. He also idolized his favorite Uncle Bob, who influenced his sense of humor and the way he talked. At age 17, Tom took a fake ID and auditioned at the only comedy club in Orlando, The Funny Farm. Throughout his junior and senior years, he did shows every weekend in Orlando and branched out to one-nighters all over the state of Florida. After graduating from Oviedo High School in 1985, Tom went on the road. At 19, Tom won \\"The Funniest Person in Central Florida\\" contest. The grand prize was the opportunity to perform at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles, California. Rhodes had a chance meeting with Jay Leno at a jazz club called Cheek to Cheek in Winter Park, Florida. Tom was not old enough to get in the club at the time, so he waited by the backstage door for the opening act to walk out. When they did, he stuck his foot in the door and watched Leno's show through a crack in the curtain behind him. When the show was over, Leno discovered Tom and, impressed with his curiosity, took him backstage and let him ask questions about comedy and what it takes to be a comedian. Part of the advice Leno gave was that great comedians should be living in New York or Los Angeles to better seize performing opportunities on stage and TV. On his first appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Rhodes reminded Leno about this meeting, which Leno recalled. Rhodes took Leno's advice and moved to New York City. He spent, what he describes in interviews, as the worst year of his life living in Washington Heights \\"like a dog\\", with no money and very few comedy sets in the city. Instead, he was performing mostly one-nighters in New Jersey and Long Island. Eventually, he got a break when he was booked as a headliner at his first quality venue, The Punchline near Atlanta, Georgia. At 22, Rhodes moved to San Francisco, which he called \\"the Jerusalem of stand-up comedy\\", with the sole purpose of growing and strengthening his craft. At the time, San Francisco was a beacon for creative comics in the early 1990s. He became friends with other up-and-comers there, such as Margaret Cho, Dana Gould, Marc Maron, Patton Oswalt, and Greg Proops. During this time, Tom got noticed and began appearing on shows like An Evening at the Improv, Comic Strip Live, Caroline's Comedy Hour, and MTV's Comedy Half Hour. While in San Francisco, he performed as the opening act at concerts for James Brown and The Everly Brothers. Tom Rhodes is featured in the 2010 book ¬°Satiristas!: Comedians, Contrarians, Raconteurs & Vulgarians written by Paul Provenza, Host of Showtime's The Green Room with Paul Provenza, which features photos by San Francisco photographer Dan Dion. The book also includes interviews with George Carlin, Eddie Izzard, Trey Parker, and Matt Stone. =Comedy Central= After an appearance on Comedy Central's Two Drink Minimum, Rhodes was signed to a one-year development deal, the first stand-up to sign with the young station. He filmed several comedic rant commercials. These were shot in a jail cell and edited like a music video, a format popularized in the early 1990s with Denis Leary's MTV rants. Comic Marc Maron, a personal friend of Rhodes, hosted Short Attention Span Theater during this time. On an episode of his WTF with Marc Maron podcast he confessed that during their Comedy Central days, he was jealous of Tom's commercials. He said that after he complained \\"like a little bitch\\" to the network, he was able to get an image piece on the station just like Tom. Rhodes said that his time on Comedy Central was a positive one. \\"They were just starting out [as a station],\\" he said. \\"They didn't have these signature shows like South Park, Politically Incorrect, and The Daily Show. It was really like being a junior filmmaker; I could do whatever I wanted! They loved me!\\" Rhodes explored this creative license when he hosted and wrote Viva Vietnam: A White Trash Adventure Tour. Viva Vietnam was a docu-comedy and Tom's first television travel show. He chose Vietnam because the country had just opened up for tourism in the early 1990s and he had always been interested in Vietnam due to his father David, a decorated Vietnam war helicopter pilot veteran. He wanted to bring humor to something that was otherwise bleak in American history. Viva Vietnam aired in 1995 on the 20th Anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War. Rhodes explored the country, pulling stunts such as setting up a Slip N Slide on China Beach. In addition to commercials and Viva Vietnam, Tom was often interviewed or featured in other Comedy Central shows, such as Comics Come Home, Politically Incorrect and The Daily Show. As a spokesman, he was utilized by the station for special segments or events. A few of these included going up in the Budweiser Blimp and interviewing players at Super Bowl XXVIII in Atlanta, Georgia; interviewing Shaquille O'Neal in the Dream Team II as they prepared for the 1994 FIBA World Championship and the 1996 Olympics; and a week on the H.O.R.D.E. festival, in a bus sponsored by Levi's Jeans and Comedy Central, along with Blues Traveler, Sheryl Crow, Joan Osborne, The Black Crowes, and Ziggy Marley. These segments usually aired during commercial breaks. Rhodes shot two Comedy Central Presents, which aired in 2001 and 2009, respectively. Both specials were filmed at The Hudson Theatre in New York City. Featured comics are allowed to choose their own unique backgrounds for their episodes. For the first one, Rhodes chose Leonardo da Vinci's study overlooking Florence, Italy. For his second, Rhodes requested a background featuring the great monuments of the world, including Colossus of Rhodes (the inspiration for the title of his third CD), to be bunched together. =Television= Rhodes starred in NBC's Mr. Rhodes during the 1996-1997 fall lineup. It was his first primetime television show and lasted for 19 episodes, although 2 episodes were left unaired. It followed The Jeff Foxworthy Show at 8:30 p.m. on Monday nights. People Magazine gave the show an 'A-' in their \\"Picks & Pans\\" section, calling Rhodes a \\"gifted standup comic\\" and the show \\"a Welcome Back, Kotter for the gentry.\\" Rhodes has gone on record saying his time on the show was only about six months of his life, but the effect it had on him was immense. The Orlando Sentinel reviewed his sitcom unfavorably, mostly critiquing his acting. During filming, Rhodes said that the constant jokes about his long hair and his inability to focus on stand-up, started to get to him. When the show ended, he used the money he earned to live comfortably in New York City again and concentrate on comedy. He called this his \\"NBC Artists Grant\\". Rhodes had a relationship with Dutch actress Anniek Pheifer, and moved to the Netherlands with her. The relationship ended, but it jumpstarted his involvement in Dutch television. He hosted the talk show Kevin Masters Show starring Tom Rhodes. The show ran on Dutch Yorin television for two years beginning in 2002. The producers of the show wanted an American to host the show and give his take on Dutch culture. The name Kevin Masters was a generic one to use until they found an actual host. Tom's audition for the show featured his normal stand-up routine and was selected as the best by producers. Rhodes was akin to David Letterman in the Dutch late-night talk show world. In addition to Dutch celebrities, Tom interviewed American celebrities, as well. Since there is no censorship on Dutch television, Rhodes was able to smoke marijuana with Tenacious D at an Amsterdam coffee shop and Steve-O stapled his scrotum to his leg in full uncensored nudity. Rhodes lived in the Netherlands for five years. In a fourth season episode of Insomniac with Dave Attell, Attell visited Amsterdam with the intention of experiencing the Seven Deadly Sins while there. As the host of Kevin Masters Show starring Tom Rhodes, Rhodes represented \\"Envy\\", since Attell was envious of his cushy job in such a liberal town. Rhodes took Attell to some of the hottest nightclubs in Amsterdam where Rhodes was often surrounded by adoring women. This added to Attell's envy of Rhodes. When his talk show ended, Rhodes began hosting a travel show Yorin Travel on the Dutch television station Yorin. The format was fitting for Rhodes, who was starting to gain international appeal. It was also reminiscent of the travel show he did for Comedy Central in Vietnam. For a full season Rhodes filmed travel segments all over South America and Europe, including Peru, the Champagne Region of France, Saint Petersburg, Russia, Wales, the Dutch Caribbean, Aruba, Curacao, and a special Beatles tour in Liverpool, England. Rhodes appeared on the premiere episode of Red Light Comedy - Live from Amsterdam hosted by Russell Peters. On the episode, Tom does regional material, such as calling the Belgium city Antwerp \\"Hand Throw City\\" and about marrying a Dutch woman. =Radio= As of 2009, Tom Rhodes has been producing his own podcast, Tom Rhodes Radio, which features conversations with comedians, Tom's family and friends, and unique people he meets on his travels. The episodes are casual conversations between Tom and his guests with a comfortable feel. The podcast is an extension of the interviews Tom has done for his television shows and travel DVDs. Episodes are released on iTunes at least once or twice a month. =Travel blogs & DVDs= Rhodes travels with a toy Elvis doll and takes pictures of the doll in various places around the world. The pictures can be seen on his website. Some of the 80 pictures include Elvis at historical monuments and cities, such as the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC; Mount Rushmore South Dakota; Valley of the Temples in Sicily, Italy; Big Ben in London, England; Pyramid El Castillo in Tulum, Mexico; Tokyo, Japan; the Grassy Knoll in Dallas, Texas; Times Square in New York City; The Great Wall of China in Beijing; Sydney Harbour in Sydney, Australia; the Berlin Wall in Germany; the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco; the Alamo in San Antonio, Texas; Machu Picchu in Peru; Thailand; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Antwerp, Belgium; France; Aruba; Greece; and Argentina where he visited with family on his mother's side. He became a travel writer for The Huffington Post in 2011, documenting his various travels. Personal life Rhodes was born in Washington DC to Sara Rhodes (n√©e McCollough), from Buenos Aires, Argentina, and David B. Rhodes III, an insurance salesman from Washington DC. On his podcast with his Uncle Bob, Tom explained that since his family is from DC, that they have \\"a certain amount of blackness to the way they speak\\" and that he takes a lot of pride in that. His family moved to Oviedo, Florida in January 1980. Tom‚Äôs parents divorced during his childhood. Tom's father David was a decorated Vietnam war veteran. In 1968, he was selling insurance and driving a cab in D.C. when he enlisted in the army for U.S. Army Flight School. It was the last year he could qualify at age 29. David had three little boys and a wife to support at the time and never expected to serve. His logic was that peace talks had started in Vietnam that year and his flight training would take a year to complete. Instead, he ended up with one of the most dangerous jobs as a Huey helicopter pilot, flying supplies and troops into landing zones during combat. He earned a Purple Heart for his wounds and the Distinguished Flying Cross for his heroics before he returned home with a 50 percent disability. According to Tom, his father was a great influence on his sense of humor and had a way of spinning horrific war stories into something funny. David B. \\"Dusty\\" Rhodes III died at age 70 on November 3, 2009, after suffering injuries sustained in a crash from a drunk driver. David Rhodes was bedridden for three months from his injuries of four broken ribs, a broken arm and leg, and pins placed in his vertebrae. He was buried in Arlington Cemetery on November 30, 2009 with a full military funeral, an honor he received from his service in Vietnam and in the Air Force. Tom had a younger sister named Laura Beth Rhodes Goldstein, who died from stage four breast cancer on April 20, 2011. He was very close to his sister. On Tom Rhodes Radio (recorded before she died) Laura told Tom that he was the closest thing she had to an actual sister due to the helpful advice he gave her about life and dating. Since Tom's sister always wanted him to get married, Tom married Ashna Rodjan at his sister's bedside the day before she died. Tom said that though she was very sick, Laura was able to clap and say \\"Congratulations.\\" In December 2018, Tom announced on his podcast that Ashna was divorcing him. The pair recorded a podcast on Dec. 30, 2018, titled, \\"Our Last Day Together\\" discussing their divorce and desire to remain great friends who love each other. Material Rhodes paces around the stage and holds his microphone in a loose, wobbly way. It's a relaxed style he once called \\"a temple dance to honor the spirits of the universe.\\" His pacing grew from a combination of things. First, he likens his moves to that of a boxer (he boxed at age 13 and often does jokes about it). Second, he is a fan of tennis player John McEnroe who advises to \\"Play the net,\\" which Tom says he applies to the stage, and third, he received some advice from a comic when he was just starting out: \\"[He] gave me some advice... He said, 'Sh*t in all four corners of the stage.' Simple, but what it means is that you should cover all areas of your stage, and ever since that I‚Äôve always made sure in every show I...sh*t in all four corners of the stage,\\" said Rhodes. Rhodes recognizes that some people have called this style annoying but that it is not something he can control anymore. He was once instantly recognizable due to his long hair, but cut it off after his television show ended to shed the stigma that was associated with that. Mitch Hedberg was a personal friend of Rhodes. Their unique styles of speech and delivery are often compared to each other due to the common themes of drug use, positivity, and absurdity of the day-to-day. However, a pronounced difference between them lies in Hedberg's shy demeanor and delivery, which was part of his charm. Hedberg, who suffered from stage fright, wore sunglasses on stage while looking at his feet, whereas Rhodes traverses the stage and performs in a bold manner looking patrons in the eye. He is involved with Sacred Cow Productions, the Bill Hicks-founded production company, and appeared in the Kevin Booth documentary American Drug War: The Last White Hope speaking about the drug laws in Amsterdam. Rhodes was influenced by Hicks, whom he met when he was an open mike comic and said \\"He was just a nice guy that loved comedy and comedians.\\" He released two albums with Stand Up! Records: Hot Sweet Ass and Live in Paris. Hot Sweet Ass contains more of his light-hearted observational material, including what Rhodes calls his favorite joke about \\"mixing the races until we are all the same grayish color;\\" whereas, Live in Paris references his worldly and political experiences, such as hosting a talk show abroad and traveling internationally. He is a fan of Richard Pryor and Bill Hicks.

Using a view camera in 2013 Analog photography, also known as film photography, is a catch- all term for photography that uses chemical processes to capture an image, typically on paper, film or a hard plate. These analog processes were the only methods available to photographers for more than a century prior to the invention of digital photography, which uses electronic sensors to record images to digital media. In a film camera that uses photographic emulsions, light falling upon silver halides is recorded as a latent image, which is then subjected to photographic processing, making it visible and insensitive to light. Contrary to the belief that digital photography gave a death blow to film, film photography not only survived, but actually expanded across the globe. With the renewed interest in traditional photography, new organizations (like Film Is Not Dead, Lomography) were established and new lines of products helped to perpetuate film photography. In 2017, BH Photo & Video, an e-commerce site for photographic equipment, stated that film sales were increasing by 5% each year in the recent past. Japan Times claimed that though Film Photography is a \\"dying art\\", the country could be the starting point of a movement led by young photographers to keep film alive. First Post claimed that a vast majority of photographers are slowly coming back to film.  Decline and revival  As digital photography took over, Kodak, the major photographic film and cameras producer announced in 2004 that it is would stop selling and making traditional film cameras in North America and Europe. In 2006, Nikon, the Japanese Camera maker announced that it would stop making most of its film cameras. Incurring losses in analog camera line, Konica- Minolta too announced its discontinuation of cameras and film. In 2008 the first instant film maker Polaroid announced it would stop making instant film. Interest in all types of film photography have been in the process of a revival. The Lomography movement started in 1992, which, BBC claimed, has saved film from disappearing Lomography started manufacturing updated versions of Toy cameras like Lomo LC-A (as Lomo LC-A+), Diana (as Diana F+), Holga, Smena and Lubitel. Film photographers started experimenting with old alternative photographic processes such as cyanotypes, double exposures, pinholes, and redscales. Worldwide Pinhole Photography Day is observed on the last Sunday of April, every year. Organizations such as Roll4Roll spread the artistic movement of double exposures. Film Photography Project, a web-site dedicated to film photography, announced in 2007 the comeback of large-format camera by a new startup called The Intrepid Camera Co.  Material  Film Photography does not just mean photographic film and its processing with photo chemicals. An example is tintype photography. A tintype, also called ferrotype, is a positive photograph produced by applying a collodion- nitrocellulose solution to a thin, black-enameled metal plate immediately before exposure. The tintype, introduced in the mid-19th century, was essentially a variation on the ambrotype, which was a unique image made on glass, instead of metal. Just as the ambrotype was a negative whose silver images appeared grayish white and whose dark backing made the clear areas of shadows appear dark, so the tintype, actually negative in its chemical formation, was made to appear positive by the black plate. Instant film develops an image automatically, soon after it is ejected from the camera without any processing by the photographer or by a photographic lab. Photographic paper, however must be processed after exposure in a dark room or photographic Labs.  Format  = Photographic Film = Silver-based Film supports come in various formats, of which the following are still in use: * 110 film (mono-perforated roll in plastic cassette) * 135 film 35mm (bi- perforated roll in metal can) *120 film 60mm (non-perforated roll in paper sleeve) * Large format 4x5\\" 5x8\\" 8x10\\" etc. (gelatin sheets). *Super-8 (mono- perforated roll in plastic cassette) *Cinema 16mm / 35mm (bi-perforated roll on metal spool)  Types  Films can be any of the following types: *Daylight, in both negative and reversal color films *Tungsten, in both negative and reversal color films *Infrared, mostly for black and white films  Processes  Black and White negative film may be processed using a variety of different solutions as well as processing time control, depending on the film type, targeted contrast or grain structure. While many B&W; processing developers are no longer made commercially, (Dektol, D-76 and T-Max developers are still made) other solutions may be mixed using original formulas. Color negative film uses C-41 process, while color reversible film uses E-6 process for color slides. Kodachrome used to have its own process with one developer bath per each film color layer. Meanwhile alternative photographers experiment different processes such as Cross processing which yields unnatural colors and high contrasts. This basically means processing a reversal film using a negative developer bath, or the contrary. For a more Sustainable Photography, black and white negative film may be processes in plant based chemicals at home. Film processing does not use analog technology, since information is not translated into electric pulses of varying amplitude.  Popularity  Analog photography is frequently misused as a title for those who are keen to work with, or do work with more traditional types of photography; dedicated online communities have been established in which like-minded individuals together share and explore historic photographic practices. Analog photography has become much more popular with younger generations who have become increasingly interested in the traditional photographic practice; sales in film-based cameras began to soar, and youth were seen to embrace some 19th-century technology Urban Outfitters, a clothing retail chain, has joined the trend and offers more than 60 product combinations relating to cameras, most of which are film-based. Polaroid was once a power in analog instant photography. Facing the digital revolution, Polaroid stopped production of instant film in 2008. A new company called Impossible Project (now Polaroid through brand acquisition) acquired Polaroid's production machines in order to produce new instant films for vintage Polaroid cameras and to revive Polaroid film technologies.

Their assignment is the protection of members of the U.S. federal government overseas, particularly at U.S. embassies and consulates. Fighting kidnapping and terrorism are part of their duties, as well as protection and evacuation of U.S. citizens out of crisis areas and training of personnel in foreign countries. MSD also augments other DSS agents in high-threat or high- profile protection missions. MSD is based in Dunn Loring, Virginia and consists of a headquarters element, tactical medical staff, training cadre, logistic staff, and 12 operational teams with six agents each. The team's three primary missions are: *Mobile Training Teams (MTT), hold classes for local law enforcement at embassies and consulates, U.S. Marine Corps Security Guards (MSG) and select foreign personnel. U.S. Dept. of State DSS Mobile Security Deployments Special Agents *Security Support Teams (SST) are trained for counterattacks on U.S. embassies or threats against diplomatic personnel. SSTs react to international crises or threats on short notice in order to enhance and ensure security of U.S. Department of State personnel and facilities, and assist in evacuations if necessary. *Tactical Support Teams (TST) were established in the 1990s and are typically assigned as a heavily armed reaction force in support of the protective service details assigned to high-profile protectees, such as the Secretary of State. TSTs typically shadow such protective details. MSD cooperates closely with other federal agencies, such as the Secret Service, the Fleet Antiterrorism Security Teams of the United States Marine Corps, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and local law enforcement agencies, both domestic and foreign. Selection and training MSD agents are selected from DSS agents who voluntarily want to join the specialized unit. These agents are expected to maintain more stringent shooting standards than their peers in DS. Beginning with an initial assessment, the training duration is six months and is held in and around the Diplomatic Security Training Center (DSTC) in Northern Virginia and West Virginia. The curriculum is based upon advanced weapon handling and Close Quarters Battle (CQB) tactics, counter-terror and off-road car handling, advanced navigation, precision shooting, first aid and tactics. The training culminates in an elaborate detention and personal security scenario. Throughout their three-year tour at MSD, agents continue to train at DS schools, and specialized tactics schools all over the United States. MSD also participates in joint military exercises to ensure interoperability in many places where the U.S. Department of State and U.S. Military work together. Upon completion of their tour, MSD agents return to DSS posts in the U.S. and overseas. Air capability MSD trains in helicopter operations, but does not have its own dedicated air assets. Rather, MSD uses the U.S. Department of State's globally deployed contract air assets as well as U.S. military air in certain theatres. MSD agent aboard a UH-60 during a crisis response mission in the Bahamas Equipment Garments, weapons and communication devices of the MSD are always state of the art.US Department of State Mobile Security Division MSD uniforms are tailored to the mission, and may comprise a Crye Precision or other battle dress, uniform (BDU), or low-profile civilian clothing, the latter of which is more commonly used in SST and MTT missions. MSD agents use advanced combat helmets, ballistic protective glasses such as Oakleys, body armor, gas masks, radio transceivers with headphones, tactical first aid kits, ballistic vests, various hydration systems, current-generation night vision goggles and GPS handheld devices such as Garmin 60cx, and other geolocation equipment. MSD agents stay current in military and DSS communications systems in order to remain interoperable with other agencies and military units. Since 2009, MSD has made equipment upgrades based on experiences in the Middle East.

Moore in the Vincent Calvino Private Eye series. Vincent Calvino first appeared in 1992 in Spirit House, the first novel in the series. His latest appearance is in \\"Jumpers\\", the 16th novel in the series published in October 2016. ‚ÄúHewn from the hard-boiled Dashiell Hammett/Raymond Chandler model, Calvino is a tough, somewhat tarnished hero with a heart of gold.‚Äù‚ÄîMark Schreiber, The Japan Times. Background Moore‚Äôs protagonist, Vincent Calvino, half Jewish and half Italian, is an ex-lawyer from New York, who, under ambiguous circumstances, gave up law practice and became a private eye in Bangkok. Calvino has often been likened to classic hardboiled detective characters like Raymond Chandler‚Äôs Philip Marlowe, Dashiell Hammett‚Äôs Sam Spade, and Mickey Spillane‚Äôs Mike Hammer. ‚ÄúThe hard-bitten worldview and the cynical, bruised idealism of his battered hero [Vincent Calvino] is right out of Chandler,‚Äù wrote Kevin Burton Smith in January Magazine. The Daily Yomiuri called Calvino ‚Äúa thinking man‚Äôs Philip Marlowe ‚Ä¶ a cynic on the surface but a romantic at heart.‚Äù The Nation calls Calvino ‚Äúa worthy successor of Raymond Chandler‚Äôs Philip Marlowe and Mickey Spillane‚Äôs Mike Hammer.‚Äù ‚ÄúHewn from the hardboiled Dashiell Hammett/Raymond Chandler model, Calvino is a tough, somewhat tarnished hero with a heart of gold‚Äù (Mark Schreiber, Japan Times). Some critics see Moore‚Äôs work a little differently however. Douglas Fetherling said ‚ÄúMoore is a genuine novelist who just happens to employ the conventions of the thriller genre, that his real interests are believable human behavior and way cultures cross-pollinate and sometimes crash. [His work] is real prose, not Raymond Chandler stuff, and his motives are as close to art as they are to entertainment.‚Äù  Vincent Calvino Private Eye Series  Moore‚Äôs Vincent Calvino Private Eye series is a hardboiled crime fiction in the western tradition reinvented in an exotic but realistic Southeast Asia. The series is among the first English-language crime fiction that introduces the element of Noir Fiction into the world of Southeast Asian crime fiction. The Vincent Calvino mysteries are dark and realistic, interwoven with contemporary local and international affairs. ‚ÄúMoore‚Äôs work recalls the international ‚Äòentertainments‚Äô of Graham Greene or John le Carr√©....Intelligent and articulate, Moore offers a rich, passionate and original take on the private eye game, fans of the genre should definitely investigate, and fans of foreign intrigue will definitely appreciate,‚Äù (Kevin Burton Smith, January Magazine). The Thrilling Detective has said of the Calvino series: \\"A big part of Moore's charm is his unerring eye for the intricacies of not just the Thai culture but also the Thai psyche, and the curious demimonde of the expat community, caught forever in the tug-of-war between East and West‚Ä¶. [H]e captures the sights and sounds and the lights of Bangkok's nightlife particularly well.\\" Novels from the Vincent Calvino series have been translated or are in the process of being translated into a number of languages, including German, French, Italian, Hebrew, Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, Turkish, Norwegian and Thai. The third novel in the Vincent Calvino series Zero Hour in Phnom Pehn (original Cut Out) won the 3rd place of 2004 German Critics Award for Crime Fiction (Deutscher Krimi Preis) in the international crime fiction category. Asia Hand, the second Calvino novel, won the Shamus Award sponsored by the Private Eyes of America in 2011 in the Best Paperback Original category. Chad A.

Published in 1963, it is the second novel about Vicky Austin and her family, taking place between the events of Meet the Austins (1960) and The Young Unicorns (1968), and more or less concurrently with the O'Keefe family novel The Arm of the Starfish. The book marks the first appearance of the character Zachary Gray, who dates first Vicky and then (in later books) Polly O'Keefe. Although Vicky will later appear in three novels that have fantasy and/or science fiction themes, there are no such elements in The Moon By Night. Plot summary In The Moon by Night (), Vicky and her family are on a cross- country camping trip, meant to be a transition between their life in rural Thornhill, Connecticut and a very different one in New York City, where Vicky's father, Dr. Wallace Austin, will be doing research. In another big change in Vicky's life, Maggy Hamilton, an orphan who has been living with the Austins since her father's death, goes to live with her legal guardian Elena, who is marrying Vicky's uncle, Douglas Austin. Uncle Douglas and his new family move to Laguna Beach, California, where Vicky's family is to visit them during their travels. The first chapter begins with the wedding of Elena and Douglas. The family's adventures show its differences from contemporary society. Along the way, they meet a teenage gang in Tennessee, help rescue children from a flood in Texas, and find an abandoned baby at a campsite in Utah. Vicky's younger sister Suzy grows emotionally during the trip, from wanting to adopt a fawn near the beginning to her later swift and competent rendering of first aid when another child is injured, despite wrong-headed demands by nearby adults. They see bears several times, and though they always act properly, their peers sometimes do not, with dangerous results. They also encounter anti-U.S. sentiment in a campground in Canada and intimations of the Cold War throughout their journey. Early in the trip, at a Tennessee campground, Vicky meets Zachary Gray, who arrives with his parents in a luxuriously equipped tent trailer pulled by a brand new black station wagon. She finds him charming, handsome and intelligent, but also frightening in his cynicism and recklessness. He pursues her (in person and with notes left behind) at other campgrounds across the country and in Laguna Beach. Vicky enjoys this attention, but the rest of her family dislikes Zach. She resents this, torn between obedience to her family and her growing need for independence. Observing Zachary's paleness and shortness of breath during an interpretive hike in Mesa Verde, Vicky's father, a doctor, deduces that he has a history of rheumatic fever that has damaged his heart. Dr. Austin several times orders the boy to avoid strenuous exercise as he accompanies Vicky and her family in their sightseeing. Late in the trip, at Yellowstone National Park, Vicky meets Andy Ford, another boy who becomes interested in her. Andy is more emotionally stable than Zachary and far more cheerful, but also less exciting. Zachary turns up with his parents at the Austins' next destination, in the Black Ram section of Wyoming, and exhibits jealousy toward Andy. A few hours later, a game of hide and seek ends with Zachary missing. As the Austins search for him, Zachary lures Vicky to a remote mountainside to speak with her privately about Andy. Vicky turns to return to her family, but is unable to do so after an earthquake brings down her side of the mountain in an avalanche. Zachary is trapped between two large rocks with a broken wrist. Vicky comes to terms with her concerns about the precariousness of life and the existence of a loving God, and Zachary promises to take better care of himself. Vicky waits with Zachary until help arrives. Major characters *Vicky Austin -- The heroine of the Austin family series of novels and stories, Vicky is the first person narrator of this book and others. Fourteen years old at the time of the novel, Vicky is beginning to assert her independence from her family, going off by herself to think, questioning her religious upbringing and other attitudes, and learning, through travel and her conversations with Zachary, that the world is much bigger and more diverse than she previously encountered in her sheltered life with her family in rural Thornhill, Connecticut. *John Austin -- Vicky's scientifically-minded older brother, John, has graduated early from high school at approximately age 17, and has been accepted at M.I.T.. He is primarily interested in astrophysics. John is intellectually curious and philosophical, generally loyal and kind-hearted. However, he has a low tolerance for Zachary. *Suzy Austin -- Generally considered the beauty of the family, Suzy \\"has wanted to be a doctor ever since she could talk.\\" At age eleven, she already knows more about first aid than many adults, and puts this knowledge to use without fuss or panic. Suzy is fond of animals, and keeps lists of species encountered on the trip. *Rob Austin -- The youngest of the Austin children, Robert Austin is curious and loving, with a penchant for insightful questions and unintentional wordplay. Madeleine L'Engle has acknowledged that Rob is based on her own youngest child, Bion Franklin. *Dr. Wallace Austin, or \\"Wally\\", is the father of the four Austin children, and elder brother of Douglas Austin, an artist. Their mother died when Douglas was born, and their father also died early. Wallace is a \\"country doctor\\" in general practice, who also does research when he can. As of The Moon by Night, he has temporarily turned his practice over to another doctor so he can spend a year conducting research at a New York City hospital. *Victoria Austin, Vicky's mother and namesake, is the daughter of Reverend Eaton, a popular minister who also spent time as a missionary in Africa. Victoria attended boarding school in Switzerland, where she met her best friend Elena, who eventually marries Douglas Austin. Victoria briefly sang professionally, and an album was made of her songs. She met Wallace Austin while singing to injured soldiers at a Veterans Administration hospital. *Zachary Gray -- Student. Extremely affluent but directionless, Zachary, a student who was recently \\"kicked out\\" of Hotchkiss, vacillates between his desires for redemption and self-destruction. Charming, exciting, unpredictable and emotionally needy, Zach brings out both the best and worst in Vicky. Zachary shows a strong interest in anthropology and is quite knowledgeable on the subject, but rejects it as a possible profession because \\"there's no money in it.\\" He has a damaged heart as the result of rheumatic fever, but refuses to see any more doctors and is not sure there is any point in trying to stay alive in a troubled world. Themes The novel touches on such themes as the fear of human annihilation, especially nuclear annihilation; the then-imminent changes in sex roles; the power of America; the question of whether human beings are basically good or evil; and the existence or non-existence of God. L'Engle's narrative shows the same respect for adolescent intelligence that is prominent in A Wrinkle In Time and its sequels. For example, Zachary discusses anthropology knowledgeably with Vicky, and Classical music is important in Vicky's life. (Elena Austin is a famous classical pianist.) Although the chronology of Madeleine L'Engle's Austin family and Murry-O'Keefe books places the events of The Moon by Night decades later, the concerns of the narrative itself are very much of the Cold War era. Vicky refers to fallout shelters, Duck and cover, and, indirectly, to the involvement of Oak Ridge, Tennessee in the Manhattan Project. On several occasions Vicky expresses fear and dismay about the precarious situation in her world. Beyond these, the major theme and conflict of the story is Vicky's adolescent struggle to establish her own identity as distinct from that of her family, reconciling her existing loyalties with her growing need for independence. As she states in chapter 8: \\"You have to go off by yourself or you must stop being you, and after all I was just beginning to be me.\\" Having spent her childhood as a happy member of a large family, the fourteen-year-old has recently come to feel that her family was \\"holding me back, keeping me from growing up and being myself.\\" During the Austins' stay in Laguna Beach, Zachary takes Vicky to a performance of The Diary of Anne Frank, which leads Vicky to worry about God's apparent failure to protect Anne Frank from man's inhumanity to man. The narrative quotes several times from Psalm 121, particularly the passage from which the novel's title is taken: :The sun shall not smite thee by day, :Nor the moon by night. :The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil; :He shall preserve thy soul. Vicky takes note of the use of the psalm as a prayer in the play, just before the Nazis arrest the Frank family. Zachary also urges Vicky to accept his belief that there is no God to protect her. Yet at the end of the novel, despite her earlier ambivalence toward religion, Vicky makes her stand against Zachary's nihilism, and cries out the words of the psalm as she awaits rescue. Awards *Winner of Austrian State Literary Prize, 1969. Background and context The novel is based on a real-life camping trip made in the spring of 1959 by Madeleine L'Engle and her family, the Franklins, during which she first had the idea for A Wrinkle in Time. Like the Austins, the Franklins took their long vacation during a period of transition between life in a Connecticut farmhouse and relocating to New York City. In her introduction to the current Laurel-Leaf paperback editions of the Austin family novels, L'Engle states: \\"Somebody remarked to me that the books about the Austin family might just as well be about my own family. Indeed, the Austins do a great many things that my family did....\\" L'Engle writes about the Franklin family's camping trip in A Circle of Quiet and in her foreword to the 25th Anniversary Collectors' Edition of A Wrinkle in Time. Related works At one point in The Moon by Night, Suzy Austin makes a joke about \\"tessering\\", and Vicky's first person narrative identifies this comment as relating to the story of Meg and Charles Wallace Murry. This reference to the events of A Wrinkle in Time, which was published the previous year, may be seen as \\"breaking the fourth wall\\", but alternatively may mean that the Austins are aware of the Murrys' experiences as actual past events. Since Vicky and Meg's daughter, Polly O'Keefe, both date Zachary Gray, Vicky and Suzy are referring to events a generation earlier. The Murrys and the Austins live in similarly- described rural settings in Connecticut, so the Austins' knowledge of the Murrys may be locally-derived. The Moon by Night takes place about two years (perhaps slightly less) after Meet the Austins, which begins when Vicky is twelve years old. Vicky is fourteen going on fifteen in The Moon by Night, but initially lies to Zachary that she is sixteen. After the camping trip, the Austins spend approximately a year in New York City, during which they experience the events of The Young Unicorns, aided by recurring L'Engle character Canon Tallis. The following summer, in A Ring of Endless Light, Vicky meets another major L'Engle character, Adam Eddington, and also renews her relationship with Zachary. The Austins' camping trip is said to begin in the spring before school lets out. This places the beginning of the novel shortly before the events of The Arm of the Starfish, in which Adam Eddington takes a summer internship with Calvin O'Keefe, and must decide whether to trust O'Keefe and Canon Tallis or, alternatively, Kali Cutter (who betrays him). When Adam meets Vicky the following summer, John Austin alludes to Adam's bad experience with Kali. Nomenclature * Zachary's last name is spelled \\"Grey\\" in both hardcover and paperback editions of The Moon by Night, but Gray in subsequent books. In A Ring of Endless Light, Vicky describes his eyes as being \\"gray, the way his name is spelled\\" as opposed to \\"grey\\". * The book's title is taken from the King James Version of Psalm 121.

I Am a Long Way from Home\\" is the opening track on the Scottish post- rock band Mogwai's 1997 debut album, Mogwai Young Team. It was primarily composed by the band's bassist, Dominic Aitchison, prior to the 1997 Mogwai Young Team recording sessions. The song features electric guitar, bass guitar, drum kit, organ, and glockenspiel, bookended by sampled monologues from friends of the band. It is an example of the predominantly electric guitar- based genre the band employed at the time; featuring quiet, clean sections contrasting with loud, distorted sections, sometimes connected with crescendos and diminuendos. This dynamic contrast was referred to by the band as \\"serious guitar music\\". \\"Yes! I Am a Long Way from Home\\" received a positive reception from music journalists, with album reviews focusing mainly on the effectiveness of the dynamic contrast featured within the song, the band's usage of instrumentation, and the track's overall representation of the band's genre at the time.  Origins and recording  The first live performance documented of \\"Yes! I Am a Long Way from Home\\" was on 6 April 1997 at Highbury Garage in London‚Äîthe band's first show promoting the Ten Rapid (Collected Recordings 1996‚Äì1997) compilation album. This performance, as well as several other performances of the track throughout 1997, was instrumental. During this period, \\"Yes! I Am a Long Way from Home\\" sometimes went under the title of \\"New Dom\\". The song took its title from an exclamation from Lee Cohen, a Chicagoan friend of the band, at Brighton in May 1997. The band recorded \\"Yes! I Am a Long Way from Home\\" during the Mogwai Young Team sessions from July to August 1997 at MCM Studios in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, Scotland, where the band had previously recorded the majority of their earlier material. The song was produced by Mogwai and Paul Savage, who handled production and mixing duties on the bulk of the band's previous recordings.  Musical composition  \\"Yes! I Am a Long Way from Home\\" is 5 minutes 58 seconds long, in the key of A major, in 4/4 time. The song begins with an organ pedal point of an A note, accompanied by a recording of a monologue passage from a Bergen Student Newspaper, being recited by Mari Myren, referring to when Mogwai played a show on 15 March 1997 at the Hulen, in Bergen, Norway. Myren describes the band's music as \\"bigger than words and wider than pictures\\" and states that \\"If the stars had a sound, it would sound like this.\\" The sound of clapping is heard, followed at (0:54), by a bassline. This is joined at (1:09) by a soft drumbeat and a clean, two-note guitar melody, based around the chord of A major. At (1:31), the guitars and bass guitar modulate to the relative minor chord, F‚ôØ minor, and D major, and play alternate melody, before returning to the main melody. This is repeated until (2:32), when the drumbeat gradually fades out, leaving only the ride cymbal keeping the beat, and the guitars, which repeat a melody based around the chord of A major, using harmonics. At (3:11), the bass guitar joins in, followed by the drum kit, building to a gradual crescendo, eventually climaxing at (3:42) into a distortion-laden chord progression, using the chords F‚ôØ minor, D major, and A major. At (3:46), a guitar solo is played over these chords. This continues until (5:09), after all instruments have faded out except for the tremolo-laden feedback of the guitar.  Release and reception  During professional reviews, \\"Yes! I Am a Long Way from Home\\" received largely positive reception. Ian Mathers of Stylus Magazine described the song as \\"gorgeous, moving from a gentle beginning to a series of shattering crescendos\\", also noting that it \\"describes almost all of Mogwai‚Äôs music at this stage of their career.\\" David Wilson of The Daily Nebraskan described the song as having \\"low-key harmonics and [a] delicate melody\\", followed by \\"a blistering shard of explosive distortion [bursting] out of nowhere\\", noting that the dynamic contrast within the song, \\"sets the seesaw pace for the whole record.\\" Lee Harvey of Vox also referred to the dynamic contrast, noting that it \\"[goads] and [entices] you with gentle percussion, leaving you helpless before the surge of sky-swallowing guitars that follows\\". Scott Irvine of UpBeetMusic described it as a \\"standout track\\", also noting \\"[the] track alone is worth checking out 1997‚Äôs best bet for an instrumental tour de force\\". Christopher Jackson of Fluffhouse described the track as a \\"to-the-point introduction to the classic Mogwai sound - elegant musings on a web of bass-heavy guitars, growing patiently to a peak filled out with massive distorted chords and fat drum fills\\". Brandon Wu of Ground and Sky described the song's progression, \\"[starting] with a quietly pretty melody . . . [building] to a massive climax of guitar and bass noise.\\" and \\"woven through [the] crescendo is a beautiful, lyrical guitar line . . . simply stunning.\\"  Credits and personnel ;Mogwai * Dominic Aitchison ‚Äì bass guitar * Stuart Braithwaite ‚Äì guitar * Martin Bulloch ‚Äì drum kit * John Cummings ‚Äì guitar * Brendan O'Hare ‚Äì guitar, organ, glockenspiel ;Additional musicians * Barry Burns ‚Äì monologue * Mari Myren ‚Äì monologue ;Production * Paul Savage ‚Äì production, mixing  References   External links  * *\\"Yes!

At the time of his death, he was Bishop Emeritus.Former Madison Bishop Dies Biography =Early life and education= Born in Maple Lake, Minnesota, Bullock attended Saint Paul Seminary before being ordained a priest on June 7, 1952, for the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis. He taught religion for a number of years at Saint Thomas Military Academy (later renamed Saint Thomas Academy), an archdiocesan high school. He was also the headmaster at St. Thomas Academy. He served as the parish priest at Saint John the Baptist Roman Catholic Church in Excelsior, Minnesota from 1971 to 1980. =Auxiliary Bishop, St. Paul and Minneapolis= Bullock was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of the Saint Paul and Minneapolis Archdiocese and Titular Bishop of Natchesium on June 3, 1980, by Pope John Paul II, and was consecrated on August 12, 1980. =Bishop of Des Moines, Iowa= On February 10, 1987, he was appointed bishop of the Diocese of Des Moines by Pope John Paul II, succeeding Maurice John Dingman. =Bishop of Madison, Wisconsin= On April 13, 1993, Pope John Paul II appointed Bullock the third Bishop of the Diocese of Madison. In 1995 he made the controversial decision to close Holy Name Seminary, a private boys high school.

Jacob received musical instruction from his father starting at a young age. At eight years old Avshalomov visited Portland from China with his parents and were guests of Jacques Gershkovitch for several months in 1927. Note: Profile by David Campbell. Aaron Avshalomov had become friends with Gershkovitch in the Orient (Jacob was three years old when the two met). However, because they did not hold permanent visas the family returned to China. Avshalomov graduated from British and American schools before age fifteen, then worked as a factory supervisor in Tientsin, Shanghai and Beijing over a span of four years. Avshalomov was also active in sports and won the diving championship of North China. In 1937, Avshalomov assisted his father in Shanghai with ballet production and working on scores. He then enlisted with a British volunteer corps following Japan's invasion of China during the Second Sino-Japanese War, and eventually returned to the United States with his mother in December 1937. Avshalomov spent a year in Los Angeles studying with Ernst Toch, followed by two years in Portland, Oregon to attend Reed College (1939‚Äì1941). During this time he studied with Gershkovitch and participated in the Portland Junior Symphony. He then spent two years at the Eastman School of Music to study composition and orchestration with Bernard Rogers. During World War II he lived in London, where he conducted a performance of Johann Sebastian Bach's St John Passion. Career Following the war, Avshalomov received the Ditson Fellowship and joined faculty of the music department at Columbia University, where he taught from 1946 to 1954. Here he conducted American premier performances of Anton Bruckner's Mass No. 1 and Michael Tippett's A Child of Our Time. He served on the National Humanities Council from 1968 to 1974 and the Music Planning Section of the National Arts Endowment from 1977 to 1979. =Portland Youth Philharmonic= Following Gershkovitch's death in 1953, guest conductors lead the Portland Junior Symphony (now known as the Portland Youth Philharmonic) for its thirtieth season‚Äîone was Avshalomov. Avshalomov was appointed the orchestra's second conductor in 1954.

He led the ensemble on their first international tour in 1970. The orchestra became known as the Portland Youth Philharmonic (PYP) in 1978. The year 1984 marked the orchestra's sixtieth anniversary as well as Avshalomov's thirtieth year as conductor. Avshalomov retired in 1995 after an estimated 640 concerts and 10,000 auditions.
